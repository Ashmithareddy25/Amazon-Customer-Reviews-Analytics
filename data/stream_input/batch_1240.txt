B005UT29Z0|5.0|well done very entertaining, I found the end a bit of a fast cut but still makes sense !!  highly recommended and worth watching
B00000G3I2|5.0|Received this movie in excellent condition in a timely manner. If you graduated in the sixties and this was your era of time  then you would definitely identify with this movie!! This movie is one of my very favorite movies.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|i've seen the inside job,(excellent) and too big to fail,(kinda thought they made wall street almost look sympathetic in it's insanity) but this movie kinda explores it from a different side than the before mentioned. it kinda pinpoints the zero point of the (2008)calamity to a small group of excellent actors, and it unravels in a blunt way about three quarters of the way through when the \\"solution\\" is decided, that quite consicely sums up walls streets attitude toward anyone but themselves.<br /><br />i had no idea what the movie was really gonna be about, and unlike inside job or too big to fail it keeps it's scope very narrow, and very focused on the specifics of the begining hours or the calamity. casper the ghost(from priest, a beautiful mind) does a great job, as does kevin spacey, and the guy from hero's was surprisingly convincing.<br />and i watched it twice.<br /><br />i gave it 5 stars cause 1)it's bound to be underrated 2) acting's great and really excellent, (the begining scene of a manager getting fired, he just sits listening, but his face is so expressive) and 3) the flow is really great. there weren't any moments of \\"oh god how much more\\" or \\"hmm...could've done without that lengthy collage of pensive faces.\\"<br />obviously if you're not interested in the subject, maybe zonk out to captain america(i'm not judging, probably watch it myself someday) but if you're into it, check this out.<br />very, very cool.

B004LZFWJO|3.0|i agree. i wouldnt buy it but a decent free game. all these kids think they are actual critics and leave 5 or 1 star. no in between. still not a bad game
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Why are people complaining about the price when they didn't even pay for it? This game isn't a new concept but its a good puzzle game to play when you want something slightly different than the standard match-three game.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|It's a simple game, but still really fun. Works great on my HTC Incredible. It's kinda got the same feel as popping packing bubbles. Great time waster, fun for kids or adults. Should be normally priced lower though. I would say $1.99  would be a fair price.

0143115014|5.0|Oh man, I have fallen absolutely in love with this book. It's a lot smaller than I expected, which disappointed me at first, but now I appreciate it because it's more portable! There are few books that I've been tempted to treat like a textbook and scribble inside, but this is absolutely one of them. Right now I'm working my way through writing all the perfumes that interest me into my own notebook (I'm on the letter C!), and after that, I'll move onto the smelling stage! I cannot wait.<br /><br />I took a gamble and also ordered the slim \\"best of the best\\" version of this book that just came out (2 days ago) and I'm definitely glad I did. It will be coming with me to every perfume counter.<br /><br />Perhaps I should take a step back with this review. Not everyone is going to want to curl up in bed with a book full of perfume reviews, but if you are (or know) a budding perfumista (or a full-fledged one who somehow doesn't own this book yet) you cannot go wrong with this.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|It's a fun game but there are a few problems that need to be fixed. (1) Game area is small, even on my 4.1 inch screened phone, so I was often hitting the wrong piece of candy.  2) The levels are extremely repetitive. A little more variety would be nice. If improvements were to be made would definitely rate it 5 stars.

B004LZFWJO|3.0|It's a fun game, but as another reviewer said, it doesn't run at full resolution. It shrinks the board to a space so small that my fingers cover half the playing area.

B00275EGWY|1.0|This is perhaps one of the five worst movies I have watched.    First, what is bad about this movie?  This movie scores poorly in the following categories: story line; acting; cinematography; music; sound effect; screenplay; tension.  Consider the poster scene.  You are trying to defuse a bomb that you apparently are not familiar with.  You find a wire that leads from the bomb to somewhere else.  As a smart person, your next action?  The brilliant director decides yanking the wire and pulling several other bombs is a strategy that will resonant with a viewer's brain.  Come on.    Then, what is good about this movie?  Price, I guess.  The price is good not for you, but for Nicolas Chartier, the French producer of this sorry piece of junk.  Mr. Chartier got Hollywood on his side.  Unlike other stupid movies, which are deservedly unknown, this abysmally stupid movie is hailed by Hollywood moguls as smart. You ask why. Shrewd political statements tailored to the taste of Hollywood monkeys make up for the lack of artistic, logical, and rhetorical skills. That is why.  Disclaimer: I do not care about the political view of this movie or any other movie.  I care about a clear story line that is reasonably logical.  In this case, I cannot see a shred of justification to waste two hours of dear life on this incoherent monument of incompetence in movie making.

0553801473|1.0|I have had this book for many months and simply cannot finish it.  I used to make it a point of honor to finish every book that I started and this one is more than I can do.  The first three books were great, hooked me on the story lines and characters and made me glad there was more to come.  I found the 4th (which I was able to just barely finish) and now this 5th in the series to be very disappointing.<br /><br />To call this author \\"The American Tolkien\\" is undeserved.  Both series are weighty, complex and deep, but Martin's has become simply shallow, repetitious, disjointed and boring.  It's a shame really because it started out with such promise. I don't believe it will stand the test of time like \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" have done.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the first book's HBO adaption and am looking forward to next season.  However, just like with the books, I find I skim over (fast forward) the sex scenes which have become soft porn and frankly, boring.<br /><br />I won't buy the subsequent books (if they are ever published) hot off the presses like I have previously until I know they are worth the read.
1451648537|5.0|I just finished reading Steve Jobs. Wow! I must say I'm breathless (once again). With the number of reviews already published, I'll focus on a few key points that made an impression.  1. Walter Isaacson tells a very engaging story. His narrative captivated me from the get-go. He elegantly wove the various angles of Jobs's work through the timeline, which wasn't an easy task when you consider all the projects that were developed concurrently. It's a magnificient read.  2. I found it interesting to read \\"Jobs in his own words.\\" It was hilarious to discover how much he and Bill Gates cursed - something I could have guessed but was never made explicit in other works about him.   3. There wasn't all that much new information. I don't know if it's because of my interest in Steve over the past few years, but I already knew most of the content presented in the book. There were not that many \\"Damn, I was wondering about that!\\" moments during my read.  4. The book lacked a lot in terms of Jobs's personal life. I expected to read a lot more about it, given that Isaacson was an \\"authorized\\" biographer. I believed I would find more extensive interviews with the children and his wife. They appear to be completely peripheral to Jobs's life, although the book doesn't allow me to conclude that at 100%.  5. One of the true heroes the book reveals is Woz. I delighted in reading the passage about the first typed character that showed up on the screen. What a humble genius! His bio is next on my reading list.  In summary, it's a great book on Steve Jobs. If you want to know more about the showmanship of Steve, there will be more interesting options on the market. I give it 5 stars because it is truly a fantastic read.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is at least the FIFTH time I have paid George Lucas for these movies. That said, the blu ray version is well worth it! Especially on the older movies, they truly look and sound amazing. Scenes in episode IV and episode V (EMPIRE STRIKES BACK) are ridiculously clear and improved - even on a huge screen (as I have - albeit a high end one  The packaging is also really nice - a solid book-like feel to the set with nice graphics/art worked in for each movie and the extras. I was disappointed that Lucas opted NOT to include a digital copy feature given the new generation being introduced to these classic movies, preventing easy portability for kids, etc and/or playing in a car/truck without blu ray capability. I couldn't help feeling Lucas was holding yet one more thing back to make us buy again...GRRR....HEY GEORGE - we've already paid PLENTY!  They should provide a code and allow those who paid for the set to download portable copies. Still, this set is a MUST for any STAR WARS fan! Go buy it and enjoy!
1117066037|5.0|For Whom The Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway<br />Book Review by Benn Bell<br />The title \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" is taken from a poem written by John Donne wherein he makes the claim that because of our common humanity, every death necessarily diminishes each of us, therefore, ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee. This is a book about death and dying set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.<br />Hemingway's novels and stories present a certain kind of hero: \\"The Code Hero.\\" This individual lives by his own code and struggles gracefully and bravely against death and annihilation. Another consistent theme found in Hemingway is courage under fire or dire circumstances, whether it is in the bull ring, behind enemy lines, or hunting man-eaters in the green hills of Africa. Cowardice is particularly loathed.<br />The novel begins in 1937 at the height of the Spanish Civil War and takes place over a four day period.  The chief protagonist is an American named Robert Jordon who has been tasked to blow up a bridge behind enemy lines in the Spanish mountains. He is aided in this task by a band of guerrillas headed by Pablo and the woman of Pablo, Pilar. We also meet the beautiful Maria. A young Spanish girl whose parents were murdered by Fascists soldiers who then raped and abused Maria. Some say that Maria represents Spain and her gang rape represent the despoilage of Spain by the Fascists.<br />Robert and Maria fall in love at first sight. This is another recurring theme to be found in Hemingway, that humans can find salvation through romantic love. The couple makes love together in Jordon's sleeping bag on the ground outside the mouth of the cave where they are all hiding.  He asks Maria \\"Did the earth move for thee?\\" This is the earliest I have seen this terminology in print and is now considered a clich&eacute;, but it may be that Hemingway coined this usage.<br />Hemingway's use of language was controversial in this novel. Many Spanish words and phrases were translated literally word for word which gave a sense of the Spanish but sounds archaic and stilted to our English hearing ears. For example, the Spanish characters in the novel referred to each other as thee and thou. The traditional second person singular in English is \\"thou/thee/thy\\". The most exact way of translating \\"tu\\" from Spanish is \\"thou\\" or \\"thee\\". This was a bold experiment. Once the convention was understood and accepted one got used to and even grew to like it.<br />During the course of the novel many flashbacks and digressions take place as various characters tell their stories and reminiscence about the past. We learn, for example, that Jordon's Grandfather was a Civil War hero in the America's war of rebellion. We also learned that his father was a coward and that he shot himself to death with a pistol. It is indeed ironic that Hemingway's own father committed suicide and that Hemingway took his own life with a shot gun many years later.<br />Death is the primary focus of the novel with much discussion amongst the characters about what it is like to kill another human being, was it the right thing to do and what would it be like to die.  In the end, Jordon is fatally wounded after successfully completing his mission and trying to escape. He waits by the roadside while the others get away, hoping to kill as many of the enemy soldiers as he can before he dies.<br />It took me a long time to get around to reading this book. I have been carrying it around with me since 1971. I finally read it in 2011. Forty years. It was well worth the wait. While each man's death may diminish me to some extent, this novel has made me whole.literally word for word which gave a sense of the Spanish but sounds archaic and stilted to our English hearing ears.

B003H9MSPG|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying I never had a Nerf gun as a child. I'm in college, but (as with most childish things) there seems to be a resurgence of Nerf guns, especially in the Humans vs. Zombies circle.  I purchased the Longstrike CS-6 at Target for about the same price (tax eliminated any difference between ordering online) and also picked up a few spare clips and darts.  I really enjoy taking things apart and seeing how they work - and if it can be improved upon.  That being said, this blaster was a challenge to crack.  I've read more than my fair share of reviews and how-to's on modding the Longstrike, but it seems that Hasbro is now gluing parts of the rifle together, to further reduce the oh-so-easy modifications.  That being said, high marks on durability; I put a fair amount of elbow grease into cracking the case open and only had a negligible amount of deformation of the plastic shell. Easily covered up with paint.   The \\"scope\\" that comes with the Longstrike is a combination of two sights that be used in different ways to accurately lay down some darts.  The instruction manual that comes with it explains it better than I could, but it's fairly useful for a cheap piece of plastic.  The barrel extension attachment is really only good for intimidation, but seems to lend a little more accuracy to the dart, if at a few feet of range.  All in all, I lend a hearty recommendation for the Longstrike.  Great \\"sniper\\" blaster for trick shots, or remove the barrel extension and you have your basic bolt-action \\"rifle.\\"   5 Stars for fun  4 Stars for \\"optional engineering/modification education\\"   4 Stars for durability  5 Stars overall, because nothing says \\"fun\\" like a little cubicle warfare when you have the edge!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was definitely one of the best books I've ever read.  I thought it was very balanced and confirmed my belief that Jobs is the most fascinating human being in our generation.  I would equate him to anyone in history who changed the world through innovation and obsession: Leonardo, Newton, Bell, Edison, Ford, etc...  His legacy will be remembered forever.  Yet he was very human and a tragic figure with lots of demons; namely abandonment that drove him to perfection.  The series of events and experiences through his life's journey forges the man he became.  Also, the sheer number of world leaders he comes across and collaborates with during his short life is simply amazing.  Jobs took his tools and skills to make the most out of his life.  I thought the book did a great job in explaining everything behind the man and the company he built.  There is no one else on this earth who's had as much impact on everyday life of American citizens in the last 30+ years.  You have to read this book to find out how he did it.  RIP Mr. Jobs.  You will be sorely missed.

B00005QTAR|5.0|\\"The Savage Curtain\\" was a mediocre episode and not one I enjoyed.  It was most illogical.  \\"All Our Yesterdays\\" on the other hand is a remarkably great episode.  When else do you see Kirk not getting the girl and ending up being accused of being a witch?  The best part though is seeing Spock revert to the savage past of his home world.  If you want to continue this episode in book form, get copies of Yesterday's Son and Time for Yesterday by the phenomenal author A. C. Crispin.  Yes, Spock mating with the lovely Zarabeth superbly portrayed by Mariette Hartley had results, namely a son called Zar. Spock finds out to his shock that he has a son.  He and Kirk travel to Vulcan to tell T'Pau about Zar and how family must not be abandoned.  T'Pau agrees and uses her influence with the Federation and Starfleet to authorize Spock and Kirk going to the Guardian of Forever and traveling back to Sarpeidon to rescue Spock's son.  The sequel Time for Yesterday is another time travel trip to the past to see Zar and that's all I will say because anything more could spoil the book.  A. C. Crispin has seamlessly woven both novels with \\"All Our Yesterdays\\" to make a very believable story.  Spock is shocked to find that his son Zar is a grown man when he had been expecting an infant or very young child.  Even more dismaying from Spock's perspective, is that Zar has a mind of his own and is not especially interested in being obedient. Dr. McCoy is also really great in both books.  His compassion and humor and even stern parental attitude contribute to Spock and Zar making peace with each other.  There are many scenes that simply require laughing out loud as Spock tries to come to terms with being a father.

I have read all of Riordan's demigod books and I must say, \\"The Son Of Neptune\\" (like all of his books) has all the previous stories pale in comparison.

B0043GXYBO|3.0|This book is not something I would normally enjoy. It's very obviously a teen book. I say that as an adult who enjoys YA literature but who doesn't like the 'teen' tone that sometimes is prevelant. In the case of Marked, it's the constant asides of the main character (\\"she reminded me of Sarah Jessica Parker, who I don't like because she's too perky\\", or \\"Whoa, did I really just say that?\\") Sometimes these were humorous, but most of the time it seemed like the authors were trying too hard to sound like teens. There is also a constant stream of pop culture references, which I hate in books. (I should say that I'm not the target market for these books and I understand that...but not all YA books are written in this juvenile tone and those are the books that I greatly enjoy. I do understand why these books would appeal to teens).  But despite the annoyance at the main character's inner 'struggles' and the terrible vocabulary (Really, what 16-year-old says poopie? And how many times does a character have to say 'whoa', 'cool', 'uh' or 'like'?) I found myself enjoying the story and the world enough to want to know what happens in the next book. I was able to rise above my dislike of how this book was written and enjoy the story. I also really enjoyed the characters of Stevie Ray, Damien and the twins as well as Grandma Redbird...though Zoey was hard to like (due to her inner thoughts I'm sure) and Aphrodite is a complete stereotype.  Also please note that this book is not for young teens. There is profanity, sex references and drug/alcohol throughout the book (this didn't bother me, but readers should know it's there in case it would bother you). Also, there is a lot of religious aspects of sorts...there's  a few ceremonies that include reference Native American traditions and some that reference wiccan principles (again this didn't bother me, it was actually very interesting, but some people are very put off by anything 'anti-christian' so I thought I'd mention it).  This is something I would get from the library and not something I would ever want to read again. I enjoyed the story once I forced myself to adjust to the terrible narrative voice...this could have been a good story if only it had been better written. My advice is to get Marked from the library because while the world is interesting, it's so poorly written it's not worth spending money on.

0385732554|3.0|In a world of euphemistic perfection, Jonas is anxious, yet excited, to find out what work he will be assigned to do in his community. Everyone is assigned work at the age of twelve and Jonas is no different. But his work assignment certainly is. He's been selected to take on the most honored - and the most painful - assignment in the community. It is a work that no one else can do, except for the man who was selected for the work before Jonas - The Giver. He trains Jonas and prepares him to really understand and acquire the wisdom that comes from the work. Not only does Jonas remain brave and courageous throughout his training, but he goes beyond that and thinks of a way to try and save his community even if it thinks it doesn't need saving.<br /><br />Jonas' community has been developed into an isolated community devoid of free will and the people have been trained from infancy to accept it and to know no other way of life. Every December there is a ceremony held for each age group ages 1-12. Everyone in a given age group is given the same thing. For all the new children born that year they are assigned names; the eights are all given the same style jackets to signify their age group; the nines receive their bicycles; the tens have their hair cut in a particular style; the twelves are assigned their work. Everyone knows their place and the rules. Adults apply to be married and The Elders assign the partners. Those parents apply for children. They are allowed only one boy and one girl and those children are assigned to their parents during the ceremony where they are named. Dreams are scheduled for discussion in each family unit as a matter of course every morning. Feelings of the day are discussed at dinner. But soon Jonas learns that everything doesn't have to be this way.<br /><br />How would our real world change if everything was assigned and regulated? If no one was allowed free will, would we all be safer? What if we didn't know about free will - would our communities and societies be better? How long do you think a world like Jonas' would last?<br /><br />The Giver is a very popular book for children to read in schools and for good reason. We all do well to contemplate how we choose to act on our gift of free will.<br /><br />[...]ocieties be better? How long do you think a world like Jonas' would last?

0061703087|4.0|There's something about Michael Crichton's novels that makes you feel more intelligent as you read them. It must be the subject matter the novels are based on and the ease of description and explanation that Crichton weaves into the story. Crichton writes of things most people wouldn't think of. And yet they're not so far-fetched as though the ideas sprang from Mars. His novels are usually based on some type of scientific fact. Take, for instance, his novel Prey. In this novel we learn a little bit about nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the science wherein small devices or structures are formed by using atoms and molecules on the scale of nanometres.<br /><br />The entire story spans only the length of seven days. Jack Forman is the protagonist and tells the story in the first person as events unfold. Jack's work background is with computers. At the start of the book we learn he used to manage a team of programmers before he lost his job. The programs they write are very specific. They write what are called \\"distributed parallel processing or agent-based programs.\\"<br /><br />\\"These programs model biological processes by creating virtual agents inside the computer and then letting the agents interact to solve real-world problems...For example, one of our programs imitated ant foraging-how ants find the shortest path to food-to route traffic through a big telephone network. Other programs mimicked the behavior of termites, swarming bees, and stalking lions.\\"<br /><br />Now that Jack is no longer working, he stays at home and watches his and his wife Julia's three children.<br /><br />Julia Forman is the vice president of a company called \\"Xymos Tech\\" where she is overseeing a project involving nanotechnology in a medical sphere. Small nano cameras are injected into the bloodstream where they can transmit pictures of the inside of the body. It is at this point that all semblance of normalcy between these two characters comes to a mysterious end. Julia's behavior becomes very erratic and uncharacteristic. She works constantly and fails to return home at a decent hour. She leaves too early in the mornings. Her mood becomes defensive and volatile. Even her physical appearance starts to take on a leaner and edgier look.<br /><br />Thinking his wife is having an affair with someone from her work, Jack accepts a job offer to work at the same location as Julia. The facility is located in the desert in Nevada. There he finds that some strange events have occurred at the facility. A swarm of nano cameras has escaped the building and is now malfunctioning outside in the desert. It did not respond to the electrical summons to return back to the facility when it first went missing and it has begun a self-sustaining existence on its own. It is also murderous. For all of its behavioral traits and actions, the swarm is \\"alive\\" and bloodthirsty. It can kill anything and anyone within a minute. And it continues to come back to the facility to try to find a way inside. Everyone inside the facility is essentially trapped. It's up to Jack to figure out how to disable and kill the swarm since the nano cameras were built according to one of his computer programs.<br /><br />There is one man, Ricky, who seems somewhat opposed to the swarm's demise. Why would he be so opposed to the one thing that could save all of their lives? And Julia's still acing strangely too. There must be something deeper and darker going on...<br /><br />Prey is true to Crichton's style and usual gripping performance. It is suspensefully thrilling! Often a chapter will end with a one-liner that pulls you out of your seat in surprise and compels you to continue reading. There is also a mystery in the characters' behavior that is very enjoyable. Just when you feel you've figured out the mystery, you reach the end and realize it wasn't exactly what you may have thought. The only drawback to the novel is Crichton's use of some unsavory expletives peppered throughout the dialogue.Apart from that, the novel was extremely interesting and engaging.<br />[...]and engaging.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this DVD. For about 8 months I've been losing a pound every three weeks or so because drastic fast weight loss in the past has led to regain and surplus in the future. However, I was hoping to see at least 1 lb a week and this DVD has really helped pick up the pace. I had hit a standstill with P90X, which helped me lose 23 pounds but had no intense cardio (at least for me, in spite of my weight I'm in good shape). So, I relied on Jillian's reputation for a challenge. Although I gather I will probably not be losing 20 pounds in 30 days with this workout series, I have lost 2 in 12 days, which is double what I was losing. The only hitch I've hit so far is that she references a diet plan in the DVD that has \\"been provided;\\" however, the new copy I ordered didn't seem to come with this diet plan?    What you need to know: this DVD is NOT EASY. It IS a challenge, which is why it's so effective. It is rather high impact-lots of jumping jacks, jump rope, squat jumps etc. that WILL put some strain on your knees. Be smart and alter what you can if you have knee issues, but if you sacrifice too much, I doubt highly that your results will be as good since plyometrics are amazing for increasing heart rate and fat burn. DO start with the first workout-don't just skip to the third because you feel like you're in good shape. You may very well get your butt kicked or injure yourself. I have lost double the weight with this 20-minute workout once everyday than I lost with P90X at one to two hours per day *so far*, so it works but, again, it is intense.     For the price, this item is amazing. I really wish she had made a 30 Day Shred Part II or something, though because I've only been doing this for 12 days and I'm on level 3 and would like another step up when I finish the 30 days. My advice: GO FOR IT! It's rare that something this effective costs under $100, so less than $10 is just a miracle.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Vitalogy is one of those albums that, when taken as a whole, absolutely blows you away.<br /><br />Yes, there are some odd tracks here that don't quite serve as much of an artistic purpose as one would hope. But it's hard to say they don't fit on the album - in fact, I'd say the only track that truly doesn't fit on Vitalogy is \\"Better Man,\\" which, on an album filled with rage and paranoia, doesn't musically gel with the other songs. It's a great song in its own right, but despite the dark lyrics the melody is too soft to be perfectly at peace on this set.<br /><br />Take out \\"Better Man,\\" and what you're left with is an album bursting with energy, anger, and artistic ambition. On the surface, the album lashes out against fame and record companies. In more unskilled hands, these themes would leave the listener feeling unable to relate to the music and therefore quite distant from it. But, as with most Pearl Jam recordings, Vedder & Co. lend the songs a universal character with lyrics that can be interpreted in many different ways. In short, anyone who has ever felt anger at a world seemingly stacked up against them will be able to not just hear, but *feel* Vedder's primal and wholly satisfying screams in \\"Last Exit,\\" \\"Tremor Christ,\\" \\"Whipping,\\" and many more - and will more than likely have an unsupressable urge to scream along. Vedder's vocals are quite possibly the strongest of his career, thankfully beyond the \\"yarling\\" stage of Ten and before the period where his voice started to subtly weaken.<br /><br />The genuine anger and desperation throughout the album is absolutely tangible, and matched only in glimpses on other Pearl Jam albums. Very rarely in music is such passionate energy bottled and translated onto a recording so transparently. If your life is perfect, then perhaps you should look elsewhere for your musical needs. For the rest of us, Vitalogy is likely to tap into and bring out your deepest emotions that have been dying for a piece of music to represent them. Pearl Jam fan or otherwise, it's an experience not to be missed.therwise, it's an experience not to be missed.
B005LJITS0|5.0|Green Lantern is a solid comic book movie.  It is fairly true to the characters from the comics, but the story told in this movie is pretty weak.  The backstory takes so long that there isn't much time left for the plot of this movie.  I hope they make a sequel as that would let them skip the backstory and then just do a good movie.
B000244EMO|4.0|Predator is a 1987 american science fiction action film that tells the story of an special forces team, led by 'Dutch' (Arnold Schwarzenegger), on a mission to rescue hostages from guerrilla territory in Central America. During their mission, though, they are hunted by an extraterrestrial lifeform known as the Predator.<br /><br />Originally titled Hunter, Predator was met with mixed reactions from movie reviewers and fans of Schwarzenegger. As time wore on, though, people warmed up to the film and is actually considered one of Schwarzenegger's best films in his career. A little known fact that has circulated around the net is that Jean Claude Van-Damme was cast as the Predator in the beginning but, was replaced by Kevin Peter Hall, because of his reservations with the movie.

B005EHNMWM|5.0|I've heard Wilco before and was not really a huge fan, but I bought this album because I was recently turned on to them as a band. I was NOT dissapointed. A good mixture of their older stuff and modern stuff. Great album from a great band!
B004ZNARH4|3.0|I purchased my set from Amazon since even with coupons I can't find a local retailer with a comparable price. I'd read the reviews here regarding the packaging but figured, 'how bad could some scratches be?\\"<br />Well, my set arrived with two discs dislodged and one of those with a 1 cm crack extending out from the hub. It's 2011, I just don't understand how packaging can be this much of a challenge. I've been buying CDs since the mid-1980's and know for a fact that there are several mechanisms for securing a disc that are secure and easy to operate. One of those couldn't be adapted for use in this set? How about placing them all in sleeves with different covers at the bottom of the box? What about a larger 6-disc folding sleeve that provides a way to store the discs outside of the box so I don't have to dig to the bottom of the box and deal with those frustrating hubs?<br />Anyhow, the artwork is excellent, as always. The books and art cards are a nice addition to the set. I don't get the scarf or marbles. Is it a play on Gerald Scarfe? No. Probably not. I've never thought of myself as a scarf-person. I've been to 4 Pink Floyd/Roger Waters concerts and not once did I think, \\"you know, this is a real scarf-crowd.\\" Although, to be fair 3 of those shows were in the summer. A tie or T-shirt would have been more appropriate I think.<br />I just received this yesterday so obviously haven't had the time to listen to every version of the album included here, but I have to agree with the others here and say that the Quad mix is awesome.

B0053O89WY|5.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed the series. It has a clever script, a great cast, and I'm hooked. I'm particularly amused by the dialogue between the separate characters. This is a unique series that will be remembered for all time.
0385342055|2.0|I've loved this series since it came out. I excitedly waited for each installment....except after reading the previous one to this I started to lose faith in the series. This one has been the nail in the coffin.   Here's how all the books go. Becky spends too much money, gets in a financial pickle and somehow gets absurdly saved. Luke (after the first one) continually puts his career first much to the determent of his relationship/marriage/etc. Yet Becky is OK with it. Becky keeps secrets or lies to her family, which may make them mad for a bit, but it all works out in the end. And then the book ends with some miracle that is so anti-real life I want to scream.   I'm done with this series. Becky never matures as a character, nor does her supporting cast save maybe Suze. Kinsella is a good writer but she needs to work on developing these people who have made her so popular - or you'll lose the whole lot. No thanks to any more Shopaholic books, ok?   p.s. (Spoiler) If you write an L.A. novel for this series, I predict it'd imitate the New York one almost to the letter. So just...don't.

0385344325|2.0|This one was just okay.  It's the long ballyhooed story that explains why Reacher left the Army. Reacher is dispatched to Mississippi to investigate a murder, with the understanding that what he finds out may be so sensitive that the Army may want to keep a lid on it. What seems like a single murder becomes a case of serial killing. Adding to the confusion are cover-ups which lead to other killings.  Novels about serial killers often rely on salacious examinations of the abnormal psychology of the perpetrator. That's not a bad thing. In fact, it's probably the sine qua non of a good novel of that type. But here we get never get up close and personal with the killer. We see the end results of what the murderer has done, but unlike most Reacher novels, we never stand in the presence of the evil in such a way that when Reacher comes down on the perps in typical Biblical fashion, we feel that it's warranted. The killers and conspirators seem hapless rather than diabolical, so when Reacher finally murders them in cold blood (yes, not even in self-defense, in some cases), we end up directing our opprobrium toward Reacher himself, and not his victims. And that's not why you read a Reacher book. For Reacher's over-the-top brand of violence to work, you need to feel that the bad guy is a monster that needs killing.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|It has a cool concept, ill probably stick to montezuma though. If devs could have made this game a little more in depth it could be pretty good game. I for one dont care for the candy idea but dont let you turn you off. Definatly good free i dont think i would have spent 3 dollars though possibly .99 but not much more.

1416583432|2.0|I like the book's concept, but after discovering several technical inaccuracies, I've lost confidence in the book and have stopped reading it. For example, the book claims that human eyes can process approximately 60 images per second, whereas dog eyes can process 80, therefore dogs don't see fluid motion as we do when watching television. The author's reasoning appears to confuse different ways of measuring eye performance in ways that seem to invalidate her conclusion. For example, to quote a certain website,     \\"[1]How many frames per second can the human eye see?  This is a tricky question. And much confusion about it is related to the fact, that this question is NOT the same as:     [2]How many frames per second do I have to have to make motions look fluid?  And it's not the same as     [3]How many frames per second makes the movie stop flickering?\\"  Let's assume her [human] figure of 60 frames per second is accurate for (1). By her same chain of logic, movies seen in the theater at 24 FPS or 50i PAL TV shouldn't appear fluid to the human vision system, yet they do.  It's possible that these apparent incongruities are a matter of insufficient context and explanation rather than factual errors, but many readers will find them confusing.

0446547603|4.0|The synopsis on the back cover does the book absolutely no justice. In fact, I feel, the back cover doesn't give a slight accurate portrayal of what the book is about.  Without giving too much away, Sparks took a riveting topic which is too often not spoken about and created a moving timeless novel. It brought various perspectives about the topic to the forefront, and it took the reader through a journey with the main character, Katie as she begins to discover herself and life.  Great read.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|This is a great tv series. Full of suspense and drama. It will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what Jane will do next. I highly recommend it, start from season one there is a very interesting back story that follows through the seasons. Other than the back story each episode is individual, the back story does not play into every episode.
0399536108|4.0|I was tired of my life, I was 21 at the time and hated University and hated the town I was living in since I was 9. I came by this book by chance because I was looking for new books to read on amazon and I came across this book on accident, I saw the \\"Art of Non-Conformity\\" and Instantly it stroked my imagination to the point that I remembered a time after high school where I was supposed to travel, supposed to go live wherever I wanted to live, and work on things that I actually care about. In two sittings I was done with the book and my passion was back; immediately I wanted to do everything. Traveling was first and for-most, taking a summer off to go visit South America (Bolivia, Peru, and parts of the Amazon), I learned more in that summer than I ever cared to learn in University. Now, I'm continuing on my own path and I'm not letting others (bosses, gatekeepers, or professors) tell me what I should or should not do.  The book is great as an initial motivation, new ideas rule the pages an contents of this book. I gave it 4 stars because it is chalk full of motivation and good ideas; however, it does lack specific details to get going. Which for some incased in the shackles of the \\"real-world\\" may need more than just ideas to get started; in which case, I would recommend \\"The 4-Hour WorkWeek\\" by Tim Ferriss and \\"I Will Teach You To Be Rich\\" by Ramit Sethi (This book says its about finance but its way more powerful than that).  Anyways, overall this book is a must have for people looking to start a new fulfilling life. I sometimes find myself when I'm feeling less confident or uninspired reading a chapter or two of the book to feel better again.
B005T3AJBS|5.0|I have to say, I didn't have big expectations for this CD, but I was totally surprised.  It is unmistakingly Jane's Addiction, but with a more mature sound.  Yup, I loved the shrieking and screaming from Perry, and I still do, but this outing is a new, grown up version of the boys, and I like what I hear.    Now, people who ONLY want the old skool sound of Jane's may be disappointed, but I was extremely pleased with this outing.

B0055Q5F36|4.0|As mentioned by another reviewer, the plastic shield for the front is of poor quality. I cleaned my screen off before applying and again with the included cloth.<br />When I applied it, there were little scratches on the inside face of the plastic that caused bubbles to appear. The plastic squeegee would not get the bubbles out so I ditched the shield altogether. The rest of the case is good quality so, I am keeping it for those 2 parts (back and side protection). After buying the iphone 4 defender case from Otterbox (it was terrible)I am inclined to think they really have given up on producing superior cases. The iphone 3 case was wonderful!<br />Maybe it is expecting too much but, how can you provide a screen protector that already has scratches on the inside and expect people to be happy about it?<br /><br />\\"Update\\"<br /><br />I had the phone on top of my van for better reception and drove off forgetting it was there. We looked down the road for some time and could not find it.<br />I got a call later from a person who had found it under his car up the driveway! It had one crack in the screen after a 7.5 foot drop at 25 miles per hour! I am impressed. Still works fine. Updating the phone to ICS caused way more problems then the fall... Gave another star for a great case!

B003Q6D25K|4.0|A movie like this, or Blair Witch, or the first PA really depends on the viewer's imagination.  Some people have none, so a movie like this isn't going to be for them at ALL.    I think slasher, high budget, super effects have blown away many people's imagination.

0740785508|5.0|Before I get into the meat of my review, let me preface this for a seond. I'm a fantasy artist that's hoping to expand back into painting, something I left long ago. Most times when I look for great books to read in the field of arts, it's a lot of the really foundational stuff I know I would need, but sometimes, I want a book about the foundational stuff applied to what I specifically want to be doing. Congrats to me, I stumbled across this beauty. What a rich and diverse book this is, it's strength lies in the various examples and clear instructions it provides the reader in how to work through and create solid looking fantasy art. By applying the everyday principles of art with the imaginative examples (such as dinosaurs) in the book, you get one book with a whole lot of use out of it. Honestly, itf this bugger had like 100 more pages on how to paint building I probably wouldn't buy another fantasy art book for a good decade or so. If your an aspiring artst hoping to either get better at paints; see what they can do as a medium; or a pro just hoping to brush up (no pun intended) on what you already know but applied to some new things, this is the book for you.

0061433063|5.0|I know this isn't much of a review for this particular book, but...  You just have to read it. :D  That's all there is to it. For people who haven't been introduced to Discworld, there is no way to do it justice in a review. You just have to be there. It's like someone describing the picture on a jigsaw puzzle to you, but not letting you put it together.  Sir Terry Pratchett is the Master Craftsman of authors. His writing contains an intelligence and wit that, once discovered, you will come to miss in nearly everything else you read. You will fall in love with characters and places. You will associate yourself with one group or another.  You will want to read them all.   And then you can join the club. We have jackets. And when you are old, yours can be midnight. ;)
0060734191|5.0|I was first introduced to Garth Nix a little before my 12th birthday-when re-reading the whole Anne of Green Gables series every month was part of my normal book rotation. I didn't know what a necromancer was, much less why anyone would want to write about a well educated young woman fighting them to save her father and a whole Kingdom that had never really been her home.   Sabriel lives in a land divided by an old, crumbling wall. It's nothing special this wall, old and crumbling, nothing that would really keep out an invading force. Yet on the other side the Army of Ancelstierre waits with old fashioned weapons for something horrible to come over the wall. They wait in the dark because frequently the lights go out and any kind of technology fails them. They used swords instead of guns because the guns fall apart. All because of what is on the other side of that wall.  But there comes a time in every young girl's life when she must embrace the inner rebel who lives inside, just screaming to get to out. Sabriel's moment comes just after she graduates a finishing school in Ancelstierre that also teaches charter magic and martial arts-when a sending appears from her father giving her the bells and sword of the Abhorsen. Interpreting this as a call for help- meaning her father is either dead or trapped too far in death to get out on his own-Sabriel heads for the old Kingdom, a land she may have been born in but has no practicle knowledge of-and no idea of the new dangers abounding within.   Sabriel may be an Abhorsen-one of many in a long hereditary line-but this family of necromancers doesn't raise the dead to do their bidding, they lay them back down and send them back from whence they came.  Sabriel knows almost nothing about this.  Could she quell the tides of rising dead?  Interpret her father's message, travel through a world she has no preparation for with only a servant bound by the most powerful magic to keep it from killing her? Free a mysterious man trappedin a spell and bound by guilt for an act committed over 200 years ago that still has ramifications today?  Try to defeat an evil that has defied the Abhorsen for hundreds of years? And bring the old Kingdom into something back of the glory it once was?  As the terrifying repository of knowledge on all things dead says on its very last page: does the walker chose the path-or the path chose the walker?  I should mention that Sabriel can stand totally on its own and does so very nicely.  *******Spoilers next about what happens after Sabriel. *******  Next we have Lirael, the only member of the prophetic Clayr who can't see into the future and has dark hair instead of blond and sharp features instead of cherubic ones. Ostracized by her community after finally realizing she'll never gain the sight she becomes a Liberian in the Clayr's great library-which holds so much more than just books.  Working there Lirael becomes an accomplished charter mage and even gains a mysterious friend-the disreputable dog- who grew out of a statue and gains her freedom when she discovers her true destiny and identity.   It's been fourteen years since Sabriel became Queen/Abhorsen and in that time the old kingdom has become considerably safer-but there are still areas no one goes. Around red lake is one of them. And it just so happens that Prince Sammeth's friend from Ancelstierre, Nick (who happens to not believe anything about the old kingdom and that everything has a scientific explanation) is funding a dig at a site there that people avoid as much as possible and lighting strikes far more often than normal.  On the other side of the wall in Ancelstierre the King and Queen of the old Kingdom are politicking with the government so they don't sent thousands of refugees over the wall with promises of free land-when really they'll be walking straight into a trap set by a necromancer Sabriel has yet to catch.  And back in the Old Kingdom Sam is plotting an escape from his necromancy lessons-ashe is certain he is not meant to be the next Abhorsen. But his older sister is so clearly meant to be queen that the burden falls upon him. So does what any noble prince would do in the situation- runs away.   And lastly the whole Gangs here in Abhorsen to face the biggest evil of all- something so dangerous it was buried not only in the earth but in seven layers of warded materials guarded by the Abhorsen, sought by many a necromancer- none of whom knew what they were getting into. This is not just a fight to save a life or a kingdom, but the whole world and may more after that.    These books are amazing fantasy novels that manage to straddle the age gap between young adult and adult very well. They are quite scary, but that's the only kind of content that might be upsetting to younger readers. And since it's not nearly often enough you come across a real strong fantasy heroine who doesn't need anyone's help, they're also a big girl power boost. And funny and full of mystery and legend. Recommended to anyone over 12 or very advanced young readers who don't scare easy. I'm not exaggerating on this point- these books are full of characters and beings out of the worst nightmares.   Five stars. A trilogy to read over and over.

0061474355|5.0|I was first introduced to Garth Nix a little before my 12th birthday-when re-reading the whole Anne of Green Gables series every month was part of my normal book rotation. I didn't know what a necromancer was, much less why anyone would want to write about a well educated young woman fighting them to save her father and a whole Kingdom that had never really been her home.<br /><br />Sabriel lives in a land divided by an old, crumbling wall. It's nothing special this wall, old and crumbling, nothing that would really keep out an invading force. Yet on the other side the Army of Ancelstierre waits with old fashioned weapons for something horrible to come over the wall. They wait in the dark because frequently the lights go out and any kind of technology fails them. They used swords instead of guns because the guns fall apart. All because of what is on the other side of that wall.<br /><br />But there comes a time in every young girl's life when she must embrace the inner rebel who lives inside, just screaming to get to out. Sabriel's moment comes just after she graduates a finishing school in Ancelstierre that also teaches charter magic and martial arts-when a sending appears from her father giving her the bells and sword of the Abhorsen. Interpreting this as a call for help- meaning her father is either dead or trapped too far in death to get out on his own-Sabriel heads for the old Kingdom, a land she may have been born in but has no practicle knowledge of-and no idea of the new dangers abounding within.<br /><br />Sabriel may be an Abhorsen-one of many in a long hereditary line-but this family of necromancers doesn't raise the dead to do their bidding, they lay them back down and send them back from whence they came.<br /><br />Sabriel knows almost nothing about this.<br /><br />Could she quell the tides of rising dead?  Interpret her father's message, travel through a world she has no preparation for with only a servant bound by the most powerful magic to keep it from killing her? Free a mysterious man trapped in a spell and bound by guilt for an act committed over 200 years ago that still has ramifications today?  Try to defeat an evil that has defied the Abhorsen for hundreds of years? And bring the old Kingdom into something back of the glory it once was?<br /><br />As the terrifying repository of knowledge on all things dead says on its very last page: does the walker chose the path-or the path chose the walker?<br /><br />Five stars and beyond.

B004K4IZ54|3.0|We found the movie to be ok in normal veiw, however, we were somewhat disapointed in the 3D production.  I didn't realize they were going to do a partial 3D production.  I really thought something was wrong with my equipment as this was 2nd showing on our new 3D Samsung TV. Since thin, we have watch several other 3D movies and they were excellent.  The 3D portion of the movie was very good.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Reading \\"Steve Jobs\\" is cathartic, as we are still grieved by his early death.  In one of his last acts of vision and greatness, Steve Jobs sought out the brilliant biographer Walter Isaacson to tell his story.    Isaacson describes his conversation with Steve Jobs when he told him he would not be happy with the entire book, yet he wanted the book written anyway.  \\"Why did you do it?\\"  \\"I wanted my kids to know me...also, when I got sick I realized other people would write about me if I died, and they wouldn't know anything.  They'd get it all wrong.  So I wanted to make sure someone heard what I had to say.\\"  This biography is beautifully complete and perfectly paced.  It's no hagiography, and at times it seems Isaacson overemphasizes his faults in order to balance the world's admiration for this incredible genius.  Steve Jobs, more than creating great products, created a great company.  He changed the very way we look at technology by marrying it with art: \\"It's in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough.  We believe that it's technology married with the humanities that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.\\"   He emphasized the importance of intention when talking about the iPod and the Zune, Microsoft's weak copycat product:    \\"The older I get, the more I see how much motivations matter.  We won (with the iPod) because we personally love music.  We made the iPod for ourselves...if you don't love something, you're not going to go the extra mile, work the extra weekend, challenge the status quo as much.\\"  This is what the world lost when we lost Steve Jobs- we lost our advocate for excellence in the technology world.  Reading this biography is a joy; re-living the journey with Steve Jobs is a delight.  Lingering in the background, coloring every word, however, is the ominous cloud, the fact that this man was taken from us way too early.  This sad fact was around every corner, and added gravity and importance to his accomplishments.  No ordinary man could have changed the world like Steve Jobs.  This definitive biography is at its best when Isaacson just lets him speak for himself.    He gives Jobs the last word:  \\"I've had a very lucky career, a very lucky life.  I've done all that I can do.\\"

1455510319|5.0|Heard THE FIFTH WITNESS (Hachette Audio) by Michael Connelly.<br /><br />This is another in the Lincoln Lawyer series, featuring Mickey Haller . . . I first met this character in the film, THE LINCOLN LAWYER, and then recently heard another Connelly book, THE REVERSAL . . . this one is my favorite, probably because I found it very contemporary.<br /><br />The story talks about tough times being faced by Haller . . . with criminal defenses in Los Angeles way down, he has been forced to expand his business into handling foreclosures . . . but when one of his clients is accused of killing  the banker she blames for trying to take away her home, he jumps back to doing what he does best--handling a case that has attracted massive media attention.<br /><br />There are many twists and turns along the way, as well as an ending that blew me away . . . I won't say any more about it because I don't want to ruin the joy you'll reading THE FIFTH WITNESS.<br /><br />If you choose to listen to it, instead, you're in for a treat because of the excellent job of narration done by Peter Giles.

If they said 'black,' then it would be controversial. Other than that, there are maybe two good songs. Thought previous albums had more kick to them.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Many reviews are long, so I'll keep mine short.  The Princess and The Frog is a fantastic Disney movie. :  There are adorable characters - Tatiana, Loni, Ray, the Alligator, and even the Prince is amusing to me.  Setting is great, full of color,sparkle, and life.  It made me want to visit New Orleans. :) The plot is sufficient - deep enough for adults to read between the lines, and simple enough for children.  There are a few \\"scary\\" parts, but most Disney movies have them.   After all, we've already had (just a few listed):    --  Be Prepared - Mufasa - Lion King  --  Poor Unfortunate Souls - Ursala - The Little Mermaid  --  Hell Fire  -  Frodo - The Hunchback of Notre Dame  The bottom line - it's a cute, enjoyable movie with elements of adult humor within.  :  Worth watching.
B004EPZ020|5.0|I saw this one on the release date at the theaters. I really loved Paranormal Activity 3. The story line pieced the other two movies lines all together. You can actually start watching this movie first before watching the other 2 movies and it does make sense. The 3rd movie is where it all started. Then, the 2nd movie is the middle story. But, the very end of the 2nd movie, shows you what happens after the 1st movie. Then, the 1st movie is actually follows the 2nd movie. Confused? Well, I wasn't because I pieced it all together in my mind. And, if you like to do that too, then you would love these movies.  The 3rd movie does give you a small preview of what has happened in the other movies and starts working its way backwards in time. Then, it starts showing you how it all started. I thought they didn't really need this part and they should have just started the movie from how it all started. But, it doesn't take anything away, so I let it slide.    Usually, when I watch prequel movies, they are done pretty badly and the story line usually doesn't fit in so well. But, in this movie, I loved how it all make sense. Now, what did I see.   Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!  I like finding out why and how it all started with Katie and Kristi. In this movie, you find out that Kristi, the younger sister has a friend name Toby. Toby turns out to be the demon that is hunting the house. Later on we find out more about Toby origins and why he is there.   It looks to me like there are a bunch of women that are in this cult. This cult practices summoning demons. (I'm just not sure why they do that. But, once the demons are summoned they will seek to marry girls in their family. The demons will try to do everything to convince the girls to marry them. Meaning they will scary and terrify them until they finally agree. Then, she will have to give up the first born male child to the demon. (This was a connection to PA2.)   At the very end of the movie, the grand mother is who started it all, andshe is the one that summoned Toby. Toby is now following the grand daughter, Kristi and trying to marry her. (Now, you have the whole back story. and can start watching PA 2. Then, when you finish watching PA 2, you will understand PA 1 better.)  I really like how in this movie, they stop doing the whole human procession bit. Toby can really show off his real power and great performance. My favorite part of the movie was when Katie is chasing Kristi and she then runs into what seems like a wall. The wall of course is Toby. Then, Toby is invisible and you can't see what he is doing, but you know that he is there. You feel like something is going to happen and it does! I won't spoil it for you and won't tell you what happens. I was pretty surprised to that.  This movie made a change to what I saw in the commercial. In the commercial, you see the two little girls play bloody marry and at the end of the scene, you see a dark female figure. Well, in the movie, they took that part out and replaced it with something way better! They still play bloody marry, but it has been changed for the better. I won't spoil that part for you and you should just watch it.   I find myself laughing sometimes in this movie, and it's not because the movie is a comedy. I started to laugh because I have a good assumption to what's going to see. But, during that time before it actually happens, I started to laugh. For example, at the end of the movie, you see little Katie turn around by the staircase. The guy calls Katie and she doesn't respond. He slowly starts moving towards Katie and still calling her. She still doesn't make any reaction or movement. I start laughing. I know something bad/scary about to happen. I'm thinking, don't do it. Don't do it! Don't go to her!!! But, I'm seeing it and its happening. Then, the bad does happen. This of course, isn't really meant to be joke. I'm laughing out knowing something bad is going to happen to the character, because, I, myself, don't want to seehim/her do the action.   I say watch this movie, if you liked the first 2. It gives you some insight to why and how it all started. If you haven't watched any of these movies. You in luck. You can see this one first. This movie, is better because it slightly different from the first 2 and has a bit of a faster peace to it.
0792165020|4.0|This storyline is a bit of a departure for Matt Damon.  His character starts off super nerdy, but gradually becomes really twisted and dark.  I hated this movie the first time I saw it, but after watching it a second time I realized the story is really interesting.  I don't want to be a spoiler, but Matt Damon's character has to do some pretty fast thinking to pull off his deception.  If you don't like it, wait a few months then give it another chance.
B003L20IFQ|4.0|The concept of putting a man in a coffin for the entire length of a film probably sounded insane when it was first pitched, but viewing the finished product, one can't help but admire the brilliance of the writing, and the execution of the screenplay by director Rodrigo Cortes.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds plays Paul Conroy, a truck driver overseas in Iraq.  His convoy is attacked, and he wakes up buried in a coffin.  Using his lighter for illumination, Conroy is able to see where he is, and is immediately filled with panic, but he finds that he is helplessly trapped.  He discovers there is a cell phone in the coffin, a device that becomes his lifeline to the outside world, and the device that facilitates much of what happens in the film.<br /><br />The writing is quite creative, taking a simple static situation and transforming it into a dynamic and dramatic one, mainly through a series of phone conversations, and a few text messages and videos.  On the screen for almost the entire film, Ryan Reynolds' performance is riveting, and nearly totally convincing, as his character learns that he is being held for ransom by some unknown terrorists.<br /><br />In a maddening series of phone calls, Conroy leaves messages for his wife, his employer CRT, and finally manages to contact a government agency that might be able to help.  Dan Brenner (Robert Paterson) of the Hostage Working Group is very familiar with hostage and ransom situations in Iraq, and offers a faint hope of rescue.  Conroy's captors, whoever they may be, are very experienced at the hostage game, as besides the cell phone, they have provided various articles for him to use, like glow sticks, a flashlight, a knife, and a flask of liquor.  As the ordeal goes on, these articles come into play and are used in various ways.<br /><br />There doesn't appear to be a breathing tube into coffin, so why Paul doesn't suffocate is something that you have to ignore.  Conroy receives a visitor in the form of a small snake, who slithers into the coffin through a hole in the side.  It's completely outrageous, but still electrifying, as death appears to be literally at Paul's feet, until finds a way to convince the serpent to leave.  The action is very much in the moment.  There are no flashbacks or fantasy scenes.  The only time another actor is even seen, is through videos on Conroy's phone.  Even so, the sudden death of a coworker still has all the impact of a blow to the gut.<br /><br />Conroy is intelligent, resourceful, and someone you indentify with and feel sympathy for, as he endures indifference, frustration, and soul crushing heartbreak.  The writing is excellent.  It's quite remarkable how dramatic the phone conversations are just watching Conroy's side of the conversation, and Ryan Reynolds' performance while lying in a darkened confined space, is just amazing.<br /><br />Dan Brenner's voice comes to represent Conroy's primary lifeline.  Unfortunately, although efforts are apparently made, the Government has difficulty locating him.  With the world literally closing in to engulf him, Paul Conroy is a man who is truly screwed.  You truly feel his anger and agony, when his caring employer calls back with some interesting news.  When artillery fire rocks the ground, rattling Paul's teeth, and nearly causing the coffin to collapse, the terrorists who put him in the ground are feared dead.  But there are still a few more surprises ahead for Paul Conroy.<br /><br />Shot in Spain, director Rodrigo Cortes' effort may not be uplifting, but it will probably generate some strong emotions.  Buried is a film that draws you into its world very close, making it more of an experience than most movies.  Although mostly on his back, Ryan Reynolds delivers a tour de force performance, while somehow managing to preserve his personal sanity making the film.<br /><br />Mostly shot in minimal or poor light, getting the Bluray edition probably isn't a priority, although the Bluray/DVD combo pack can often be found for a reasonable price used.  The Bluray edition does contains a featurette that covers some of the behind the scenes goings on, and things like how different versions of the coffin were used in shooting the various scenes in the film.on does contains a featurette that covers some of the behind the scenes goings on, and things like how different versions of the coffin were used in shooting the various scenes in the film.
B005974CNA|5.0|With the loss of Mike Portnoy what would become of Dream Theater? Well, though one Mike is gone another has taken his place and all is right in the family. Mike Portnoy is an amazing musician and will be missed from this band but with the insertion of Mike Mangini into the fold Dream Theater has gone back to its roots and crafted a piece of work that takes a turn away from the heavier, more metal sound that they emphasized with Train of Thought, Systematic Chaos, and A Nightmare to Remember.<br /><br />A Dramatic Turn of Events blends the sound developed over the last few albums and blends in the more progressive rock sounds of Metropolis, pt. 2, Falling Into Infinity, and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. The drumming was at the forefront of everyone's thoughts with this album and I have to say, though it is mixed lower than Portnoy's usually blasting stickwork, Mangini is brilliant, performing rhythms and techniques few could produce without making themselves the focus of the sound. John Petrucci is excellent as usual and Jordan Rudess has produced some of his finest work since Metropolis, pt. 2. John Myung's bass stands out more than I can remember in most of the songs unlike he's done except for a few tracks here and there while James Labrie's voice sounds better than it has in a while.<br /><br />All in all, an amazing production from the band and a benchmark for progressive rock and metal. Even if you've sworn off the band with Portnoy's departure, I recommend giving this a shot just to satisfy your own curiosity.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I had seen Jill Bolte Taylor's Ted presentation quite some time ago....  and was extremely moved.  Therefore, when I ordered her book, I  was bolted to the chair.  She is an extraordinary writer, whether it  be medical details, or how she felt when her mother came to her  bedside and just got into bed with her.......you are wearing her shoes  throughout the entire book.  It is my belief that anyone who would read this book would be less  afraid of death, for she beautifully describes \\"Bliss\\" and how our  egos create our fears from various brain hemispheres.  I feel genuine love for this woman who went through an incredible  transformation, with only gratitude for all of it!  What a learning  for the rest of us.  God Bless you Jill Bolte Taylor.
076531178X|5.0|In a world where the skies are filled with ash and all the plantlife is brown, the Lord Ruler watches over the world and runs it with an iron fist. The Ska are oppressed and the Nobility treat them like toys instead of human beings. The world isn't right and it's all anyone can do just to survive from day to day.<br /><br />There are enterprising Ska who break the norms and resort to thievery, or poorly led rebellions, and it's in one of these groups where Kelsier finds Vin. She has gifts that she is only barely aware of that have helped her to survive and Kelsier is going to take advantage of them for his own purposes. He is the Survivor of Hathsin and he wants to kill the Lord Ruler.<br /><br />This book is an absolutely brilliant story. I haven't read something this engrossing in years and I'm impressed with how well Brandon Sanderson crafted this world and its unique system of magic. Definitely worth a read for any fantasy fans who're looking for something new to read and are getting tired of the High Fantasy stuff going on out there.

B005I64U5C|2.0|Okay I know everyone is up in arms about the \\"digital copy\\" of this movie, but that is not what I am going to talk about, I am going to review just the movie itself.<br /><br />First of all, \\"Green Lantern: First Flight\\" was better.  Sure it was animated, but in that one you didn't have Hal Jordan whining about his dead father and how he feels like he can't handle being a Green Lantern.  In this movie Hal Jordan, the one person on Earth who is supposed to be confident, fearless, and in control, is NONE of those things.  He's an adult who whines like an emo 14 yr old.  \\"Oh my dad's dead, wah!  Oh my girlfriend won't go out with me anymore, wah!  Oh, I lost my job, wah! Oh, I was in a life and death situation yesterday and I got scared, wah!\\"<br /><br />The whole time I was shifting in my seat, checking my phone, reading the newspaper, etc.  I didn't care!  Look, I read comic books.  I'll admit that right now.  And not EVERY character needs to be dark and brooding with daddy issues.  Seriously, we did that crap in the 90's with every single character, it only worked for like 3 characters, the rest were just crap.  It didn't work then, and it sure as hell doesn't work now.  I didn't buy this movie to watch some whiny emo brooding 20-something complaining about his life.  I bought this movie cuz I wanted to see Ryan Reynolds get a ring that lets him fly through space, shoot energy blasts, make energy constructs, talk to aliens, travel to other planets and fight Parallax.<br /><br />Honestly, if you're just interested in the things I just mentioned, fast forward past everything until you see Hal running up to Abin Suir's crashed space ship.  Say what you will about \\"First Flight,\\" but in that movie it only took 2 minutes to do what it took the live action movie 20 minutes to do!  Establish Hal getting the ring and friggin' using it!<br /><br />When they FINALLY get to Oa, we get some action at last!  The portrayal of Sinestro was PERFECT!  Seriously, it could not have been done better in any way shape or form.  But Kilowog.  Oh god what happened?  At the end of the movie Kilowog says \\"Can I train 'em or can I train 'em?\\"  Ummm, 'Wog, you didn't train Hal at all, you just kicked his ass for like 2 minutes and insulted him the whole time about how he wasn't ready to be a lantern and then you left.  Sure at the end he uses the whole, \\"The bigger you are the faster you burn\\" thing, which is an off handed comment that Kilowog made during their \\"training session.\\"<br /><br />Kilowog LOOKED awesome, the voice was good, and he had ONE good line.  \\"Welcome to ring-slingin' 101, or as I like to call it the worst day of your miserable life.\\"  That was the only good part of Kilowog's entire appearance in this movie.<br /><br />Later Hal is moping around his apartment crying about how he can't be a Green Lantern and that he doesn't want to be a Green Lantern, and that it's too much responsibility for him.  Oh god, I hear enough of this crap in my everyday life, I didn't pay $24.95 to hear this crap.  Get to the friggin' action!  And then in the VERY NEXT SCENE suddenly he grows a pair and races off to Oa to say, \\"We MUST stop Paralax and if you don't help me, I'll do it myself!\\"  Ummm, did we miss something?  How did he go from being the whiny emo punk with daddy issues to being John McClane with a power ring in like 15 seconds?  Seriously, I feel like there's like 2 or 3 scenes missing between those 2 scenes.<br /><br />I won't go into how lame the climax between Hal and Paralax is, but let's just say it's a BIG disappointment.<br /><br />I know this movie was garbage and was just setting up for the sequel, but I hope that the next one will be better and they'll get it right next time.  But do NOT pay full price for this.  If anything go rent this from the Redbox or have a friend burn you a copy.<br /><br />FAIL!!!en done better in any way shape or form.  But Kilowog.

B001OQCV2O|3.0|Usually I agree with the notion that special effects don't make a movie, and they can't save a bad movie.<br /><br />\\"2012\\" has a decent disaster plot at its core that gets sidetracked by being too sentimental for its own good.<br /><br />The \\"divorced dad who reconnects with his alienated kids during a humanity-threatening event\\" subplot was handled much better in the Speilberg remake of \\"War of the Worlds\\".<br /><br />And there are a number of lame aim-at-your-heartstrings scenes, like the Tibetan(?) monk giving the temple bell a couple last bongs before the whole monastery gets obliterated by a wall of water.<br /><br />There are also some risible characters (look no further than the Russian twins) who have some equally risible lines<br />('Da, he can be YOUR dog too').<br /><br />Still, this movie sports a look that is just stunning on Blu-ray. Even the \\"bad\\" scenes look so good that you can just sit back and thrill to the spectacle of the end of the world as we know it in hi-def. Extra credit for NOT showing yet another way the Statue of Liberty can be destroyed.

0062060554|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book based on the synopsis. I thought this would be an entertaining, intense read. I am disappointed to say that it wasn't.  I will say that it wasn't the most horrible book I have ever read, after all I did read the entire thing even though I was tempted at times to jump ahead to the end just to be finished.   I agree with all the other posts on here that say that the book started off with good potential, then became extremely monotonous.  I kept hoping that finally something would happen. This book seriously could have been a short story as about 100 or so pages was the same thing over and over.   I won't give any spoilers away, but I will say this: what you think is happening, who you think the villain is, you are most likely correct. The ending was so predictable, I was hoping for a twist, I thought that there would be no way that what I thought was going to happen would actually happen. Very disappointing. The end was so anticlimactic it was almost funny. Or sad. It was terrible. One of the worst let downs I have read.   I gave this book two stars instead of one because I did actually finish the book, I was hoping that the story would pick up so I kept at it. But overall, I wouldn't recommend anyone read this book, there are better reads out there. Or at least get this book from the library.
B00006RIO7|5.0|As someone wrote about Rodgers & Hart's first hit, \\"The songs click like a colonal's heels at attention!\\"  One flaw.  So what's perfect?  The lyrics, which are a trip to remember and sing, are filled with bad rhymes. But in this recrudescence of the Dark Ages and non-art, who cares?  Also, I found Billy's first number (some cynical thing about love) to be a bore, and the words to the opening show stopper (\\"All That Jazz\\") totally suck.  Also only the 1st 13 tracks are from the movie (and they include \\"Class\\" - that hilarious send-up OF class, which was cut from the movie though filmed, and is in the extras on the DVD), the rest of the CD is filled with some awe-inspiring garbage about I don't know what.  So I burned a copy of just the ST onto a CD-R, and just listen to that. I've got lots of the songs memorized now, and sing (if it can be called that) along in my car.  The movie knocked my socks off the first time I saw it, but custom staled and repetition something...  But I never tire of the songs.  I must be demented.  I like it much better than the ST to their \\"Cabaret\\" which I used to like a lot, in spite of what's her name.  (She sets my teeth on edge!)  And the orchestrations in \\"Chicago\\" are not the least of its pleasures.<br /><br />I never saw the live show, but have the OBC.  Verdon and Rivera are much older than the dolls in the flick, and Verdon (Lola, come back!) can barely sing.  Lots of songs were cut for the movie.  Everything else is the same except.  The show (about murder and getting off) is whimsical, humorous, campy.  The movie (which I saw) take it all deadly serious.
055357342X|5.0|Usually weddings bore the hell out of me in real life and in literature, but George R. R. Martin has a knack for bringing them to life. Of course they weren't the only events in this long and powerful chapter in the history of Westeros but they certainly were the high points.
B00466HN86|5.0|This movie has everything, comedy, drama, happiness, sadness and the most realistic shoot out scene I've ever seen. Yes, it has flaws, police officers driving while talking on their cell phone, but what it doesn't have is the \\"F\\" word and nudity. Most importantly it has a message that every man should hear, a message that could change lives. Don't dismiss it until you've seen it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I'm sorry but if you can't figure out how to use this app then you should not own a smart phone. when you load the app it generates videos that are popular. they may be songs, commercials, game clips.... if you want to search for a song or video, click on your menu button on your screen (if you have no idea what I'm talking about then I can't help you). enter the keywords for the search. a list will populate. long tap on what you want to download. you then get a menu asking what you want to do. there are several options...one is download the video. another is convert it to a mp3 format so you can listen to the song or sound. as I said. its simple. it works flawlessly. please don't rate something poorly for your lack of comprehension on how to use an app. by the way. I'm using it I'm my HTC incredible 2. absolutley no issues. wish I found this sooner. great way to get mp3 files for free.
B0036MDNN0|5.0|This item is very nice in both quality durability.  Its nice to see dinosaur figures (I wont call this a toy, because it would be a shame to give this to a child to have them destroy or damage)in more realistic poses, other than the standard museum posed that are static.  The detail is superb as are the colors. I'm keeping this for my collection, were it will be displayed.  Well worth twice the price.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|An emotional story of the courage and determination of the Duke of York, second son of King George V, stammering through a 1925 speech. His wife convinces him to see Lionel Logue, a self-taught Australian speech therapist living in London.<br /><br />Their relationship began with a rocky start, foundering over royal protocol and the Duke's lack of self-confidence. Logue prescribed vocal exercises and tongue-twister, and gave the Duke confidence to relax, avoiding tension-induced muscle spasms in his diaphragm. The Duke became king after his father died and brother David abdicated to marry Mrs. Wallis Simpson. Logue guided the new King George VI's speeches during WWII, and was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in recognition of his personal service to the Monarch. The two became friends and remained so for the rest of their lives.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|The developer reviewed his or her own game. For shame! Go ahead, read the review from August and tell me it's not fake.  As for the game, I got it for free but I certainly wouldn't pay anything. In fact, I feel that Amazon and the publisher owe ME money now for having stolen 5 minutes of my life.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This is one of the best super hero movies of the Summer 2011- old fashion well crafted fun-it has a truly diabolical villain and some terrific action scenes.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|This mixer is great for the small home recording studio setups.  I am using premium well sheilded cables with all my equipment but to to the cheaper compenents in this there can be a little analog hum at higher volumes.  The one thing that I find annoying on this is there is NO power button of any kind!  You literally have to unplug the power cable from the unit to shut it off!!! What the dilly Yo!  Who designed this thing?  They couldnt install a $0.10 switch on the power???  To get around this I bought a remote AC pack so I push a button on a wireless remote in my studio to turn it on/off, same with my Studio monitor speakers as the on/off switch is on the back of the speakers. Besides the power switch issue it has worked well!
B004T0XYKK|5.0|I am a John Wayne collector, having most of his movies. However for some reason I did not have Rio Lobo. That was fortunate, as it turns out, because it recently came out in Blu-Ray and the folks who produced it did a wonderful job remastering it. The clarity, color and sound is awesome! It makes me wish they would do more John Wayne titles on Blu-Ray.  If you don't already have this movie I highly recommend it in Blu-Ray.
0756405890|4.0|Others have covered what's good about this book, so I won't repeat that.  But I don't understand how some call him an excellent writer.  He's good.  But to be excellent you shouldn't have writing flaws.  Of course even an excellent writer probably makes errors in the first draft.  But this needed to be proofread.  In two places (in the first half of the book) somebody says something and in the next paragraph they continue as though he had said the opposite.  Sloppy, sloppy.  And the author used the word \\"hypercritical\\" when he needed to use \\"hypocritical\\".  Those are not the same words!  Another annoyance was that calamities became predictable after awhile.  This book could be greatly improved with some heavy editing.  It's too long.  Was the editor asleep?
0143115014|3.0|It's a good guide. It has certain oppositions with the opinion of a determinated perfume to others authors. It's not actualized, and not all the perfumes of the designers are here. Not a picture of any perfume bottle. In general, it miss many things...
1451648537|5.0|If you are looking for piece of fluffed and bedazzled celebrity propaganda, this book is NOT for you. I am currently reading this book and it presents a balanced picture of a very complex individual.  Steve Jobs was by no means perfect, but that doesn't diminish his contributions at all. He really comes off as a courageous and passionate and inspiring individual with lots of quirks.  Many people are finding reasons to criticize him after reading the book, but I venture to guess that if their own lives were examined and picked apart as much as Steve's was for this book, they could present a much more unflattering picture than his life has. In this day and age of Enron and Bernie Madoff, this book should be required reading for everyone in the corporate world.
B000X67ZZE|5.0|I was given the first copy of this book as a gift.  Since then I have given more than a dozen to other people.  Don Miguel Ruiz brings Toltec Tribal wisdom the modern thinkers.  In this book he outlines a simple formula for happiness.  In his next book Mastery of Love, he provides[[ASIN:1878424440 The Mastery of Love: A Practical Guide to the Art of Relationship (Toltec Wisdom Book)]] an even more in depth survey of the emotional landscape.

B004Q3RKH8|4.0|I´m 38 years old and I grew up listening vinyls records so I love this format. Vitalogy is a good album to listen because it is powerful and has the full force of that great band is Pearl Jam. I hope you enjoy.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I had this app once, and uninstalled it.  The editing is much improved, cut, copy, paste, charts, menu's; its so much more intuitive now.  Highly recommend this!  I wish I hadn't spent 16 bucks on Docs 2 go.  Great app!
B00536OCZA|5.0|All those who love music should have this album. The edition is great for all the details shown, so they should buy it and enjoy.
0061122416|1.0|The Alchemist is full of childish clichés about philosophy, spirituality and experience in life. While the main character is attaching, we are let down throughout the book, as time and again the promised pearls of wisdom turn out to be plastic beads. The fact that so many people liked the book, shows how shallow our modern civilzation is becoming. As in the Rosarch psychology test where people interpret meaningless inkspots, The Alchemist was written in such a way as to leave plenty of space for individual imagination to complete the story in the most ideal way.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I loved the female lead Katniss who was very straong and able to look after herself. The book was full tension and excitement. I enjoyed it so much that I now intend to read book two. 5 massive stars!
B0058WFO06|1.0|OK, I'm on my 4th or 5th listen now ....cause I really want to like this....but I just don't get it. And probably won't listen again. Seems to get worse every time.  A plethora of 5 stars? Masterpiece? Stellar? WTF?! This is just another in the series of Wilson's ambient semi mono tone drowning on and on \\"musical experiments\\".   Same as his last attempt. Boring, goes now where, drags on and on. Lets make some sound and noise....put together a few pieces and call it music. At times sounds like an early 70's jazz fusion wanna be garage band.  Sorry folks, but I'm starting to lose my faith in this guy. I first discovered him through PT. Huge fan of everything they've done...up to The Incident....which seems to be where Wilson took a negative turn in his musicianship. His work as an engineer on the Crimson stuff was great. Actually the one positive I will give this album is in the engineering dept. This guy always shines when it comes to the sound quality of his albums. But in this case...it's the only positive I can find.  Trust me....PT this is not. Which is cool and OK....solo stuff. I'm all for change and individualism in music. But as with his other go no where epic....Insurgentes....ARGH! Boring, long drawn out mono tone rubbish! His solo career is mediocre at best. Dude, go back to PT and put out something good again. Like Fear of a Blank Planet and before.  Pass the koolaid cause I'll need it for another listen!
B001VNB54A|5.0|I watched two a night for five straight nights and then the extras.  The action and special effects better than Band-of-Brothers plus Saving Pvt. Ryan.  The between action and wind-up were stuff was entertaining.  You could get a changing point of view due to the different producers.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|If you're looking for a (comparatively) thoughtful, relevant superhero movie, like at least two of the original X-Men trilogy, then this probably isn't the one for you. But if you're looking for a good old-fashioned mindless action flick that happens to feature people with superpowers, pop it in!<br /><br />X-Men Origins: Wolverine lacks may of the features that define the trilogy proper. There's no allegory, no philosophical questions about civil rights, disenfranchised minorities, or what it means to be human (or mutant). The thoughtful moments here, when they do appear, seem forced and do nothing but drag the movie down. The not-infrequent historical inaccuracies and lack of emotional depth would be grating...if this was meant to be the same kind of movie as its predecessors.<br /><br />Origins is definitely a very different endeavor than the other X-Men movies, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. What Origins lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in fun! It's basically two hours of everybody's favorite mutant alternating between snarling and brooding, with some great cameos (my favorite was Deadpool, closely followed by Gambit) thrown in for flavor. There are great explosions, great fight sequences, and great special effects.<br /><br />Basically, Origins has all the hallmarks of a great action movie, but none of the hallmarks of a great X-Men movie. It's got a deliciously smug villain, a beautiful-but-forgettable love interest, plenty of good one-liners (mostly deliverered by Ryan Reynolds, but Hugh Jackman himself gets a good one in now and then), REVENGE!!!!1!!, and, of course, a variety of mutant powers that just happen to facilitate the characters beating seven kinds of crap out of each other in increasingly creative ways. It's chock-full of plot holes, especially the ending, but all the actors seem to be having a lot of fun with their parts, and because they're having fun, the audience has fun.<br /><br />Turn off your brain, and just enjoy the pretty.
0792164903|3.0|There is so much right about \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" that it's unfortunate it goes awry.  Terrific Hammer style cinematography.  Jaw dropping Oscar winning art direction.  Rousing Danny Elfman score.  Expectably fine work by Johnny Depp as the bumbling Ichabod Crane.  Terrifying turn by Christopher Walken as the Headless Hessian.  Too bad all of this is in the service of a byzantine script that practically undoes all that's good about the film.  The plot that engulfs this film is so maddeningly confusing you want to throw something at the screen.  I hate movies where the writers think they are smarter than the audience.  Director Tim Burton stages some interesting set pieces and at times there are some genuinely scary moments.  Not enough, however, to save this film from the mundane.
B005IZLPMY|2.0|I was all set to like this film but found it wanting.No one could have taken Captain America seriously in the 40's let alone today.The thin plastic or cardboard shield on his back, far from being intimidating or as protection was ludicrous. And how did the director, Joe Johnston not know that the army was not integrated in those days?But then again one shouldn't expect relevance or getting history right these days!
6305137293|2.0|This flick doesn't hold up as well as it did thirty years ago.  Back when I was an impressionable undiscrimanating seventeen year old the body count was good enough for me.  It was also pretty cool watching it with an urban audience who shouted at the screen imploring in vain for the victims not to open door or closet.  Now it's no better or worse than any knockoff of the classic original \\"Halloween\\".  Events take place on the same evening as the original but it's more preposterous.  They open things up by having the action set mainly at a hospital but that makes it more ludicrous.  This has to be the darkest most sparcely staffed hospital I've ever seen.  Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis reprise their roles from the original but that only adds so much cred.  Proceed if you must but be prepared to be disappointed
0374532990|5.0|I have been a Friend of the High Line for about eight years now, since I went to one of the early summer benefits.  I have worked with Robert and Josh over the years to help plan events for young people and do some other things here and there.  Because of my involvement, I thought that I knew the whole story.  I was completely wrong.  What these two extraordinary people did to get this organization off the ground was not only wonderful, it was a page turning compelling read.  I learned so much not just about the process to save the High Line, but city politics in general.    Very rarely do I read a book on the subway that moves me to tears.  This one made me cry almost every time I took it out.  The stories are so personal and beautiful, it really provides a unique insight into the lives of these two men and all the people they encountered along the way.  I highly suggest recommend this book to anyone interested in parks, New York, history, urban planning, government, activism, community, or simply a captivating read.
B00005V9HA|5.0|Director Stuart Gordon hits a homerun in his directorial debut.  \\"Re-Animator\\" is everything a horror film should be.  Based on H.P. Lovecraft's work, it's a latter day Frankenstein story that is genuinely scary but it's frights are leavened by superbly macabre humor.  Jeffrey Combs is terrifying as psycho-nerd Herbert West obsessed with life even if he as to kill tenfold to achieve it.  Barbara Crampton may be the sexiest screen siren you never heard of.  The film's ending fade to black must be the best ever.  There is a strong gore level here but those who aren't squeamish or who are just a tad adventurous(me) will enjoy the chills this film evokes.
B0059QJ2D6|3.0|This is good, entertaining, but not great.  However, that being said, I would recommend it if you like foreign films and want to invest a couple of hours.  I will say the impossible situation the husband/soldier was put in left me thinking for quite some time.  Recommend.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I think this is one of the best of the newer horror movies. I confess to be an old-school monster guy and this film fits in that category. It is wonderfully creepy and entertaining as it is slowly revealed that The Creeper isn't just another serial killer with an ugly truck. Many of the night scenes are iconic horror images. The ending is a little harsh but not out of place among the films being made nowadays. It's worth a look for anyone who likes monster movies.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love this show and had to have the 4th season to complete my collection and Amazon fits the bill in getting it. The order was delivered quickly and I am very satisfied with Amazon.com
B0053YGYO4|2.0|Disappointed.  This is what I waited for for 3 years?  This album is the \\"African child\\" for coldplay.  GHTTG reference).  Maybe it will grow on me?  I hope so, I've been listening to Viva for 3 years now and need something fresh.  1 week update:  Ok so maybe its growing on me.  I like Charlie Brown
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Well I have owned my PX21 Gaming Headset for less than a year now and I have loved it...... However now it seems to have a short circuit or something because it moves voices into the background and skips heavily if I make any sort of movement and this is really annoying. For almost 60 bucks I am very unhappy with this so I am gonna be having a talk with Turtle Beach about getting a replacement or a refund and looking somewhere else.<br /><br />My problem might sound weird but I'm having trouble describing it. Normally you hear the music in the background and the voices in the foreground, but if I touch anything it moves the music into to foreground and I hear the voice barely audible in the background. >&lt;
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Let's say that a historical figure isn't that interesting. Is that his biographer's fault? I don't think so. Steve Jobs appears to have been a super-Yuppie, perfectionist division. In his favor, he loved Dylan and dropped acid. In his disfavor, he created an aesthetic perfection that left little room for the free expression of the user and the developer.   I think that the lack of mention of Jobs' actual death represents an agreement between the author and the Jobs family. They may wish to tell their stories later.  I think I'd rather read about Einstein or Kissinger.
0062101897|4.0|I have found that pages numbered 42 and 43 are missing.  I am not sure if this is an error in pagination or if they are actually missing.  Page 41 does ends with a sentence and the next numbered page, 44, starts with a new sentence.<br />Any other readers find this problem or am I stuck with a \\"variant?\\"<br />I haven't come upon any other glitches, but I have a long ways to go.<br />Enjoy
0441013597|5.0|I have always seen this book listed as some of the top sci-fi of all time, but was always hesitant to try reading it due to how crappy the movie was. I could not have been more wrong about how this book would be. For me to call something epic, it must truly be epic. Frank Herbert created an amazing and deep world in this book with immensely life like characters. The depth he went into describing the technology and daily lives of the Freman was astounding. This book is down right amazing, everyone should read it at least once.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|The asp tries hard to be bejeweled and fails hard. Poor graphics and something you'd expect from 1995. Free or not don't waste the bandwidth...
B0060D0H54|2.0|The movie had an interesting concept but was poorly executed.  Fans of Bruce Willis' action flicks won't find that here.  There is no mystery or suspense.  The whole movie falls flat.  Disappointment from beginning to end, but watchable, thus the second star.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I love this DVD.  Enjoyed the 25th Anniversary.  The characters, the songs, the set up and the costumes were all excellent.  I got a copy and so do my sister and best friend.
B003EYVXUU|2.0|A fan of the original film and novel, I initially had no real desire to see this one. I read so many positive reviews (and the fact it came up on instant view from my online movie provider)that I decided to give this one a try. Here are some of my questions/issues:  Initially, why the remake? Not sure. The original film is also a very recent film and is available both dubbed and with subtitles. They are both period pieces in a sense, so their is no reason to update it. I initially read Matt Reeves pay lip service to the original only to go on and say he could do better (not in so few words). Seems like hubris to me. I honestly feel Matt Reeves never understood what the original film was about.  As a film, on it's own, it is just uneven. I know some reviewers complain that the comparisons to the original is unfair but truth be told, as a separate entity this film just falls flat, although not due to the performance of the two leads. The pacing felt off, their relationship felt forced at first and the aforementioned manipulation/sympathy dynamic just didn't play out as horror and I felt we were supposed to be cheering for Abby and Owen although we shouldn't be, as Abby certainly was no victim in this film.   As a comparison? The original lacks (as far as I know) any CGI work and everything is done on camera with minimal effects (***Edit*** Have re-watched the original, the cats attacking scene was CGI). Many of the original scenes play out and I really felt witness to the events unfolding before me. This version, the CGI stuck out in this supposedly straight forward film and the hospital burning scene felt like it was crow-barred in to have some action (although this scene is in the original, it plays out well as part of a sub-plot). I felt like I was watching a movie, which of course, I was but an intimate story like this should take you away from that point of view. This movie just didn't do that nearly as effectively as the original. There is some good here. Some of the scenes were very well done but, sadly, no more so than they appeared in the original which to say, I simply mean Matt Reeves few good scenes were just carbon copies of the originals. Finally, and already mentioned, Abby was no victim in this film. We are meant to see her as victim because she is a twelve year old girl, but she is clearly not through her actions and behaviors. Eli and Osker, at the core of the original, were both victims that found each other in a sea of garbage, poor Owen is just the next benefactor.  The main issue is (as I have read from other reviewers)that Matt Reeves changed the fundamental basis of the story. Not only did he make Abby far less sympathetic but the film tries to continue to create sympathy despite the fact that we should be horrified that Abby is continuing to bully/seduce/entrap Owen in much more subtle ways than the school bullies. Although Abby cared for her old benefactor, this is also another huge departure from the original. Without going into detail, Eli was as much a victim in many ways as Oskar was, unlike the Abby/Owen dynamic. While this makes a better 'horror' film, it ignores what the original was about, not to mention the audio/soundtrack cues really played against this.  Some of the logic lapses of the lone cop character were just silly. I understand Matt Reeves was trying to compact the story but it ended up ultimately hurting (in my opinion) it overall, making the film much more conventional, something the original film and book cannot be accused of.  Ultimately it is my hope that anyone interested in this film will seek out the original and be exposed to a far better interpretation of the novel and, in turn, seek that out as well.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|Other than that it's a snooze-fest. You have more than likely been here and done this before. I wonder if Amazon just runs app names through a randomizer to select the free app because they seem to give away a lot of similar crap. How many Tetris-type clones does one person need?
B00338QENI|5.0|An excellent, thought-provoking book on two levels: the human level of Henrietta, her treatment at Johns Hopkins, her illness and premature death, and the poor black family she left behind --  so poorly educated they didn't know what happened to their mother or sister nor the questions to ask to find out.  And on the ethics level -- do scientists and medical researchers have an obligation to secure informed consent from patients before their tissues are submitted to lab research?   Two questions arose from reading this book: Have other malignant tissues since HeLa demonstrated the same immortal characteristics? How does the HIPPA law relate to these situations?
B00062PN6I|5.0|Very happy with headphones. Attached it to my Casio Keyboard very easy. Did not need an adapter. The sound is very good and it does not come from one ear.  I can easily adjust the volume from my keyboard. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|It's funny, I was just thinking, \\"You know what would be nice? Yet another Bejeweled clone to add to the dozens I have already.\\" And, lo and behold, Christmas came early with this! Thanks, Amazon! You're way too good to us.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Love this knife! I own a lot of knives and this is my favorite fixed blade. Heavy duty and ready to tackle most survival situations.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Runs well no lag on LG Optimus. Great concept, easy and difficult. No invasive permissions like some other apps. Free for now though 2.99 for a game only this far developed would be over priced. Hopefully dev has plans to further develop app, since it has potential to do so. 5 star since it's free :D
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|The film goes no where.  Try and find a meaning to the film.  They search for God, belive in God yet there is only hate and sorrow and fear in this family.   Too bad the ones who made this film spent their money on such a waste of talent.
1423140591|5.0|awesome!  I have read all of these...can't wait for more.  I love the Percy Jackson series. I wished the movie was better but it was okay.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|This DVD was great... the only bad was the packaging. It came stuffed into a small manilla envelope so the box is crushed and cannot be used to store the DVD. My grandkids collect DVD's and this one can't go in the collection cabinet because of the condition of the box. However it plays great and is in every other way a wonderful deal for the cost!!! Maybe someone knows where I can get a box for the Wall-E DVD???
B00466HN86|5.0|One of THE best movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to everyone, but especially to parents.  It's not just a tear jerker either... the humor in this movie is superb!  I laughed as much as I cried.  Most importantly the message is very strong and meaningful and one that all fathers should take heed.
0307408833|1.0|I too am annoyed that the book is not really gluten-free. More than that though, it's just not very good. I've now made 7 of the recipes. Before I learned my lesson, I tried a couple of them more than once. I wouldn't make a single one of them again as printed. Three produced something that looked edible. None of them produced anything that humans should consume.  I'm a good baker. I've made some very good gluten free and/or vegan baked goods. None of them came from this cookbook.   Seriously, I don't believe these recipes were tested before the book was printed.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I loved all the special features and thought this was a fantastic set. I would very much recommend this to a superman fan.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I used to have the free version w/ads and loved how you could match a string of items from all across the board, rather then in just one line. Best part: save up as many of one type possible, then do a HUGE string &amp; clear almost the whole board! Good game.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|well I would have to give this avg score on my list. it wastes your time (could be a good thing or a bad thing if your want). Doesn't act like your normal swipe type game, but I wouldn't say too many bad things about thing little game.
B000VAIRRW|5.0|This is not just my favorite Sum 41 album; it is my favorite album period.  Every single song in this is amazing, every single one (well minus the joke French song).  I've had this album for 4 to 5 years now and still listen to it regularly.  Underclass Hero has punchy in your face Sum 41 style songs like March of The Dogs and King of Contradiction.  Main stream pop-punk songs like Underclass Hero and Confusion Frustration. Memorable ballads like So Long Good Bye, Best of Me, and With Me.  However the best songs are the ones I can't really categorized. They are almost their own genre; I've heard no other songs like them.  Speak of The Devil, Pull the Curtain and sort-of Walking Disaster are these simply seamless pieces of art, it's like they have a perfect balance of a calming emotional frustration along with a well refined level of musicianship.  I can't really describe them with words, so you must listen to them.  The only knock that you can really put on this album is the writer almost copies riffs from similar bands (I don't mind it at all, these riffs fit the Sum 41 songs more than the originals.  For instance the solo in Best of Me is almost identical to Green Day's Wake Me Up When September Ends.  Also Pull The Curtain and Confusion Frustration have riffs that are very similar to ones you would find in a few Blink song.  Also the Piano in Count Your Blessings doesn't work perfectly and kind of sounds like a generic Linkin Park song (however the chorus is amazing).  Buy this album.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I bought the blu ray version of this because it had all the extras. The only way to watch all the extras was to rewatch the whole movie! I LOVE THIS MOVIE, but I do not want to have to watch the entire movie and interact with it to watch the extras. I will not be buying another blu-ray disc again. Honestly, I wish they would just make regular DVDs with the extras again, this is so annoying!  5 stars to the seller  5 stars to amazon  5 stars to this movie  3 stars to blu ray. BOOO!
B00064X3FO|5.0|This is Elton's first album and perhaps his best. I love his early stuff and this is about as early as it gets (1969). The album includes the standout chart toppers \\"Your Song\\" and \\"Take Me to the Pilot\\" but give a listen to the rarely heard \\"First Episode at Hienton\\" which appears to be about his (or Bernie Taupin's) first romantic relationship with a woman (Valerie - is this the woman who now lives in Fort Worth?) and how he was unable to consumate it. Also \\"Sixty Years On\\" is beautiful song recently covered by Brandi Carlile. Another rarely heard but terrific song is \\"The King Must Die\\". This SACD (also plays on CD players) is quite terrific sonically and adds 3 songs originally recorded on other albums.
B000G6O2TS|5.0|I purchased this figure, along with several others of the Schleich line, and was amazed at how well crafted they truly are. The figures are well sculpted, well painted, and very durable - meaning that if I WAS to let my son have a go at them, they could hold up to the punishment.<br /><br />They are accurately detailed, with no traces of 'fantasy' or 'mythology' to them - no flaming swords, or oddly shaped weapons and armour. The knights are superbly crafted and historically designed.  Note the beautiful paint scheme, as well as the paint job - it is clean and crisp.  The sigil on his shield, the crowning dragon plume atop his helmet and the shadowing on his armour is fantastic!  The sculpt as well as the paint is easily ten stars production, and the quality cannot be beat... this is one to that can stand up to the rigorous play of children and come back for more.<br /><br />If I may quote the previous post of EquisNiger: \\"The pieces come in two opposing camps: the Red Fleur de Lis, and the Blue Lion, and each piece has a corresponding piece in the other, with somewhat different design and graphics. This reflects an impressive variety in styles of armament and armor of the period, and vastly improves the educational value of the series. \\"<br /><br />In this case, the Knight, Dragon is wearing Tournament Armour and sporting a Tourney Lance (The blunt, fist-like know at the end of his lance), so he can actually be used to bolster either side of Schleich knights you and your little ones may own, or he could be that dreaded lone warrior - feared by all, and bested by none, able to hold any pass or bridge against countless foes. The great thing about these figures is - the only limit to them is your imagination!<br /><br />In all, I give this line of figure and their accessories Two Thumbs Up!
B005HXGE9G|5.0|Peter Gabriel has been known to expand his musical dexterity over the years, so this album isn't a great surprise. Well, maybe it is. He takes many of his most popular songs (San Jacinto, In Your Eyes, Red Rain, Don't Give Up) and mashes them up with some lesser known tunes and somehow manages to create what might be called an old fashion rock opera. Gabriel loses the guitars and drum kits and hires an orchestra conducted by Ben Foster. John Metcalfe steps in and orchestrates it all, and damn if it doesn't sound fresh and new. Gabriel handles all the vocals with backup help from daughter Melanie and others on various pieces. He had some issues adding \\"Solsbury Hill\\" (track 14) to the track list because he didn't think it added itself to orchestration. So included is 4:48 of dead air (track 13) before we get to track 14. Unlike other recent releases at least you can skip the track. This has always annoyed me when we get 4 or 5 minutes of nothing before getting to the \\"bonus track\\". This is one of the best albums I've heard all year.<br /><br />I opted for the \\"Special Edition\\" 2 disc version. What a great second disc. Essentially this is a reprise of disc 1 without any vocals (except for the last track \\"Blood of Eden\\"). The genius is in the orchestration. When this disc is played in it's entirety it is like listening to a great symphony. Listen to this album on the best system you can find. You won't be disappointed.  Beautifully done.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|best movie ever! Ledger was superb!the best batman movie ever made !****** buy this movie today in blu-ray you will not be disapointent!
B003EYVXT6|1.0|This was on sale at Best Buy for $5.99 (Halloween special,) so I picked it up.  Man, it wasn't even worth the price I paid!  In fact, I couldn't finish it!  There was absolutely nothing scary about this movie.  Splice plays out more like a poorly-written science fiction drama.  The acting was only average at best.  Some of the cinematography was fairly well done, but the over all plot killed it.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie to anyone that I like.
B004FEJ3VY|3.0|It's tiny. not at all what i expected. It's an okay toy. It won't be played with very much. doesn't really do anything. I would buy a larger version.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|I've known of the band for some time.  The few tracks I've heard from samplers and Youtube have always been great, but for some reason, I haven't gotten around to buying any albums until recently.  I had no idea which one to buy, so I just clicked \\"Add to cart\\" when Amazon suggested this album.  I have to say that I'm quite pleased!  Surtur Rising is the perfect addition to my Melodic Death Metal collection!  The songs are all very well composed, have many great hooks and the vocals are pretty brutal sounding!  The only bad thing:  If I listen to this album when driving, I tend to speed!<br /><br />I plan to buy many more of their albums in the future!
0780626966|5.0|This is all around a great box set. If you want all the movies & don't want to buy them 1 by 1 then get this &  for The 1999 Box Set. Casue what was put out last year is a bunch of bull s  h  i  tl. You do get 1-New Nightmare & [[ASIN:B0000VCZMK Freddy vs. Jason (New Line Platinum Series)]]However you don't get The Nightmare Series Encyclopedia which has interviews with all the directors of each movie or Producer Bob Shaye & the actor that played Freddy Robert Enguld & each case has awesome art work from the old poster & you can get FVJ cheap. The 2010 Box Set does have all the old movies but it has Jackie Earle Hayley on the cover & he had nothing to do with those movies but you know Platinum Dunes needed to market that poorly made remake. I'd like it if they could put out a Blu Ray Box Set & put all kinds of features on 2, 3, 4 & New Nightmare. I haven't seen The Never Sleep Again Documentery. But if you want to see my thoughts on each movie I revied 1-New Nightmare & the remake last summer. So go for the 1999 Box Set.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|It is like Weeds and Dexter gave birth to one bad @$$ little kid. It says something about today's standards of life when a meth head and a chemist can engage a powerful range of personal growth. There's probably a good joke in that line....<br /><br />But the cook gets burned and finds out he has lung cancer. What's a guy to do when he has a family that depends on him, even after he's gone? Not even the Writer's Strike can get in the way of this train. It's bad. Very bad. And that's good.<br /><br />Why is it that we gravitate towards those who, twenty years ago, who have been abhorrent and never even considered to be 'art' in the media sense of the word. And I guess it says something else about our world today when we've realized not every bad guy is indeed a bad guy. Progressive or the way of the High Road?<br /><br />Whatever. That's all philosophy. Skip the musings and watch a few episodes of this award-winning series. First sampler is one me....
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I really enjoyed World War Z as it presents a self-consistent, plausible view of world affairs in the wake of a zombie apocalypse. It is thoughtful and insightful, without a lot of gore, which is quite a feat for a novel about zombies. A thorougly enjoyable read, highly recommended.   If you're a little squeemish, this is the zombie book for you as it will interest and excite without too much in the way of blood and guts.
B00000269G|5.0|This is an oldie and this digital reproduction is as good if not better than the original album I purchased in the early '60s.
B004C4IKCU|5.0|Elvis is Back (Legacy Edition) is the best sounding recording of the album I've heard to date. The remaster sounds wonderful especially when played on a high quality sound system. 2 CDs contain lots of great songs from the early 60's and some of the best underrated songs of Elvis's career. The album contains a big booklet with lots of color photos and information pertaining to the recording of Elvis is Back! Check this out you will not be disappointed. I would also recommend the other legacy edition Elvis albums for they all sounds amazing.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This movie is fun for all ages. My son, grandson and myself all watched it together and we all laughed and winced in pain with Dre Parker.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|I played four rounds and every time I finished I eas on level 1again.  Is the game messed up or is it my score is not high enough,  no instructions so I don't know.  The pictures are cute and tbe any direction swipe is different.   Fun but does not seem to be very stimulating after a few sessions.  More for young kids.
B005DZMNHA|5.0|I have been a Chris Rea fan since 1996 when a friend gave me a cassette tape to listen to. Since then I have found and purchased his music on CD. I must admit I like this one very much,I think it is his best. There is talk he should have done this or he should have done that but I think this is what he was going for in his music. He is not the best guitar player, but with his voice he is the best package out there my favorite artist along with Santana and Fleetwood Mac.
B00009R6J7|4.0|For the money this is a great level. It is good to use when out in the country/wilds where you don't want to carry a lot of weighty equipment. Works good.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|I looked at tons and tons of cases and protectors for my new 4S.  This is my third IPhone (had the original and the 3G) and used a this type of case for all.  Both the older phones look virtually new despite near continual use.  The slipcase does not scratch the case like some of the hard cases can, and works perfectly with my screen protective fllm.  The silicone really gives a superior grip and also has an endge that protects the bezel of all the apple products.  I use a similar type of case for my IPad 2 as well.  This also happens to be attractively priced, which was a nice thing after dropping almost $500 on the new device.  I also like this this case allows you to use all the factory buttons easily.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|My title says it all.  There's no creative spark left in this band's body.  Inept, repetitive, boring.  The production is grim.  Having Brian Eno produce your music means Brian Eno controls your music.  The band continues its attempted arc into becoming the world's next U2 (whom I admittedly have not liked since their second release in the early 80's, so take that for what it is).  The first single alone steals exact guitar riffs from a band called Big Country and their album of nearly 25 years ago called \\"The Crossing\\".  The end.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Had lots of fun watching this! Loved the feisty-chick--love interest(Hayley Atwell). Had enough witty dialog to hold my interest...   ...And the dumb-asses programming Amazon's website insist on at least 20-words, so I'm including this!
B005LJK3AC|5.0|This review is for the rental. I cant speak to the quality of the discs.<br />Anyway, my girlfriend and I watched this last night and laughed throughout the movie. The interplay between the trio of Justin Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis was pretty exceptional in my opinion. They are all funny actors, and each has a different style, which played well together, blending dry humor with camp humor with neurotic humor seamlessly. Spacey was the perfect horrible boss IMO. Colin Farrell....well, i'll say they couldnt have done a better job of making a Hollywood Hunk (as my girlfriend calls him) into the most loathsome disgusting person. You can easily despise him in this movie. Aaaannnnndddd.....Jennifer Aniston....she needs to remain a brunette I'm telling you. I cant remember her being more attractive (which is saying a lot).<br />So, basically, each of the three friends has a horrible boss (the latter three actors mentioned) whom they hate working for. They are drinking one night and start wondering what it would be like to just do away with the bosses. How much better could their lives be if they didnt have to deal with them? Well, one thing leads to another as they decide to turn conjecture into reality.<br />What results is in my opinion a hilarious, mistake driven romp through their efforts to kill their bosses. I wont tell you more about the actual story, but i think everybody was cast perfectly for their roles, and this is definitely a movie i would watch again. The ending was simply awesome!<br />p.s. There are some funny outtakes at the end, so dont just turn the movie off when it's over if you are interested in seeing some of these bloopers.
0670022411|1.0|I loved this storyline and characters until about the halfway point when I began to understand that there was a serious problem with leaving all the storyline strands hanging with no progress or action to build upon any of the exciting plot points with which the book had begun. And after making me want to know the secret of the book and experience the main character's evolution, the book literally ended with absolutely nothing happening. It might as well have had four hundred pages randomly ripped out, it would have made no difference. I could not believe it, I still cannot believe an author and publisher would be so greedy and manipulative. Read Lord of the Rings, read JK Rowling. You can serialize a story without leaving readers feeling ripped off. As I turned the last few pages and realized all the filler and non-action meant sequels planned, I became so angry. I've read bad books and I've read good books, but I've never read a book that was written so manipulatively as a commercial platform for future books.   Shame on everyone involved with this book!
B005M92MJ6|5.0|This is a awesome album in my opinion. It has been my observation over the years that MJK has a love for the Cure and bands from that genre. To me, this album pays homage to that era, but takes it to a new level by folding in elements of today's more gothic sounds, and providing some fusion as well. I think Tumbleweed is my favorite song on this album presently, although i have no doubt that will change with my moods...which brings up another element of this album, which is that you can find a song to suit you regardless of what you are in the mood for. I also really love the duets here, and the layered quality of the music just takes it to another level. Very glad to have downloaded this album.<br />Enjoy!
1451648537|3.0|A great writer, great subject, but overall, an average work. Certainly not an iBiography. The book feels rushed, and in spite of 40 interviews with the man himself, in the end it felt superficial. Maybe it's just too early for a great biography of Steve Jobs to be written - his legacy needs a few decades to stew. In the meantime, I  defer to Walt Whitman to understand Jobs:  \\"Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.\\"
B004LZFWJO|3.0|Played once. Doesn't set itself apart all that much as far as desirability in wanting to play. Not exactly a Bejeweled clone, although the screens look like that.
1439192812|5.0|This is a wonderful book, written with Dawkins's characteristic clarity and elegance. About the contents, just read any of the other reviews. My advice: if you can, get the iPad version of the book. Just terrific. The first ebook I've seen really getting the most from the possibilities ebooks may offer.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is my first time ever doing a review on a product from Amazon... I have to share my results.  I did the video for about 2 weeks everyday and then stopped. I haven't really exercised in a long time so it was hard to get back to working out again.  After about two months, I started doing the video again and here are my thoughts and results:  It's now been about 32 days and I've worked  out with the dvd for about 20days total so far.  All my life, I've wanted a flatter stomach, great arms, and a model-like body.  I've worked out at the gym before for months at a time, and i didn't really see any results.  I eat fairly healthy, and I'm average in size.  However, I could never get the toned, model-like body no matter how much i worked out especially in my stomach area.  For the past few days, i've seen my stomach get more toned and shrink in size.  It's interesting.  I get up in the morning, and my stomach is flatter than the day before.  I used to have a big bulge and now i can't see it as much.  I can definitely tell the top area of my stomach is more toned and I see more of definition.  I've never in my life seen the s-line on my stomach.  Yes, it still jiggles, but it's getting tighter.  I'm in the third week, easier version of the workout.  What I really love about this video is that it's really just 20minutes of intense workout. It goes fast.  I don't have to drive to the gym.  It's also very different for each week.  Hence, it doesn't get boring.  The workouts are tough even though I'm doing the easier version of it.  I sweat so much even though it's only a 30min. workout.  I also love the fact that it's not 30 mins. or even 5mins. of just doing stomach exercises.  It's only 1 or 2mins. each round.  She has 5min. warmup, 20mins. of three different intensive(3min.of strength, 2min.of cardio, 1min.or 2min. of stomach-can't remember)and 5 min. cool-down.  When it seems like the strength is getting too hard, it's cardio time.  When the cardio seems to be too hard, it's stomach time. It allows the body to rest as the workout continues.  I've never been a fan of constant stomach crunches like 100 at a time.  In this dvd, it's only maybe 12 times up at the maximum.  I just love the results of my stomach.  The side benefit for me also has been my arms.  My arms are toned like crazy now.  I noticed the difference in about the third week.  Remember, I've skipped a lot of days.  My arms are so defined now.  My triceps are still a little flabby, but it's definitely more tighter.    Jillian has such a beautiful body and it's motivating to do the dvd.  I've bought a lot of different workout videos, but this is the only one I've done consistently and with such great results.  I am loving my stomach more and more these days.    The workouts are tough even doing the easier version and you have to really push through the sweat, loss of breath, and the tiredness.  However, you will get results.  It's really totally amazing the results i am getting with only 20days of workouts so far.  I haven't really been sore either.  This DVD is really good and I highly highly recommend it!
1451648537|4.0|One word- Genius describes Steve Jobs, who had a second run at Apple which is very rare since lightning just doesnt strike twice. Walter Isaacson as always did a great job and his timing was amazing.
B000V5ZIBU|5.0|Didn't give this series a chance when it first aired because I really liked The Next Generation and this always seemed something less.   Years removed, I was wrong. I have re-watched both TNG and this series and they are both wonderful in their own rights.   Avery Brooks is awesome just as Patrick Stewart was in his role.   Great series, and great that I get to watch it with my prime membership.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|I used to like this app when I first downloaded it, but as time went on, some things became more apparent and very annoying.  They are as follows:  1)  First... I was very excited to see it had an EXIT BUTTON.... however, IT DOESN'T FULLY CLOSE THE APP! WHY HAVE AN EXIT BUTTON to EXIT your program if it's still RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND and the user has to go to FORCE STOP IT via the APPS SETTINGS?? If you're going to put an EXIT BUTTON in, it shouldn't have the SAME FUNCTION AS THE BACKSPACE BUTTON, misleading people!  Make the EXIT BUTTON FORCE CLOSE THE APP, and if the user PREFERS TO HAVE IT STILL RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND because they prefer and trust the Android system to manage their OS more efficiently, they can simply use THE BACKSPACE BUTTON.... THEIR CHOICE!  Is this misleading or just a programming oversight? I don't know and really don't care. But it's really illustrative of developers who put something out there without realizing what people EXPECT from function buttons they put in their apps. ALL other apps I have that include an exit button ACTUALLY FORCE CLOSE THE APP... that's why the developers go through the trouble of putting one there, to make the user happy!.... and I believe that's what the user USUALLY expects that button to do. But THIS APP does not do that.  It seems to have had a hurried push to get it out without checking simple things like \\"DOES MY EXIT BUTTON ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY EXIT THE APP?\\" And what are the USERS EXPECTING? And should I INFORM them that's it's the same as the backspace button?  When people see an EXIT BUTTON, they expect it to EXIT...FULLY. AND THAT'S THE CONVENIENCE that's missing. Too bad. It's unlikely I'll play this app in the future when I need to kill 3 or 4 minutes (not wanting to play an app for whatever reason SHOULD be a 1-star if the developer wanted money for it) because I hate having to go through scores of clicks through menus to close it when it would have been just as simple to give the user THECHOICE in the matter with a simple button that ACTUALLY EXITS the app.  2)  Sometimes the game doesnt pick up my pattern string if I begin swyping a decent-sized string, and that's very annoying.  This is really because it's DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING when your finger is covering the screen.  If the icons were bigger, it wouldn't be a problem because your finger wouldn't cover the whole of the icon... but they are currently SO SMALL.  3)  Backing out of the app doesnt save the game if you don't use the exit button (or jumping to another app and back to this one, for that matter).  I don't really care about that too much because it DOES have an \\"exit\\" button that ONLY FUNCTIONS as the backspace button should (still runs in the background).  But I DO CARE about the lack of the ability to be able check a quick email or text and come right back to the game.  Currently, if I want to do that, I need to exit the app (lose the points), go make the quick check, then RE-OPEN Candy Swipe and begin again.  Ridiculous.  4)  The coloring is little dull/muted for this type of game, especially because it has a black background and makes the darker colors harder to see.  The cherries are a little too dark, and so are the gingerbread men and the candy corn.  They can all use a brighter color boost actually (and my screen is on \\"max\\" brightness, which is very bright).  This is a fast-paced visual app... colors needs to be TRUER, BRIGHTER, and colors VERY DISTINCTIVE from ONE ANOTHER if you want to be able to see the patterns easily, especially in daylight.  5)  That \\"waaaat...waaaat...waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\\" sound at the end of each round has GOT to go.  That's the sound something should make when you lose or don't achieve something.  That sound comes on no matter whether you come in first place or tenth. Surely something more dual-purpose and appropriate can be found to replace it with.  I like the CONCEPT of the game, but it really needs some spit and polish before I can enjoy playing it again and recommend it as a ready-for-prime-time app.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|Absolutely amazing! That's what I have to say about C&A, thus far I've taken critics and other reviewers like myself with a grain of salt because with films such as these you simply cannot take them seriously, why should this film have be any different? The acting was tremendous for those who do not know Daniel Craig he is English, so his accent is heavy more so then some Englishmen who have taken lead roles in American films. However this is quite different he plays a \\"cowboy\\", hardly anyone can pull that off correctly, a Englishmen to say the least (yet he did). His American accent as always was A+, but in this film its rougher, just like most western actors he really wanted to fit the part, and he did.<br /><br />The Story, well many many viewers complain that the story is just \\"stupid\\", or \\"simple\\", so? Often we go to the movies and see a wonderful story, but we don't like the way it unfolds visually, other time's visuals and action or just acting alone makes a movie compelling yet we leave frustrated in the way the story itself unraveled. Beggars can't be choosers, this film I would categorize as a film that meets many qualifications that it really doesn't need (like a complete transformation from Craig as a charming \\"Bond\\" Englishmen to a rough American Cowboy)yet it lacks some qualities such as an undeveloped story (although I won't take a star off as it was based on a graphic novel).<br /><br />All in all its fun, and like some of you who are giving this negative reviews, I to like a artsy film that makes me think, and other times I like a film such as Cowboys and Aliens, as it brings me joy as well, so why not?...Go Watch it! Have fun!
B005DF2QMC|5.0|It is a nice little product that worked as advertised and did exactly what I needed it to do. What more can be said? It was easy to install, and easy to use.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|The latest album by Coldplay takes a bit of a new direction, sure, but it's a catchy one. There really aren't any weak points to the album, although some people disagree with Princess of China. Without being a Rihanna fan I still like that song. Hurts Like Heaven, Paradise, Charlie Brown, Major Minus, Up in Flames, Every Teardrop is a Waterfall - any band would be glad to have one song as strong as these on their albums. Definitely a must.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|For a die-hard Les Mis fan this was just a fabulous culmination of years of the best play and music ever written.  It was exciting to see the original cast in this DVD and to see the newest Jean Valjean who has the most incredible voice.  It is a music experience that shouldn't be missed.  I sent it to my daughter who lives in France and who introduced me to Les Mis 25 years ago.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Excellent, is as good, or better than previous Lady Antebellum CD's. I watched them since they first were on CM Tv.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|After the success of the original [[ASIN:B0012QVJXS The Superman Movie]], it should have been a foregone conclusion that Richard Donner would return as Director of Superman II.  In fact, most of the second film had already been shot by Donner when the original film was released in 1978.  Unfortunately, however, the producers (the Salkinds) and Donner had a falling out. Predictably, both sides blame each other for the split, but the generally accepted truth is that Donner was fired because the Salkinds felt Donner was to blame for the original film's budget issues and objected to his stubborn insistence that the Superman legend be respected; Donner refused to capitulate to the Salkinds' demands for various gags that would have brought the original film dangerously close to self-parody.  Thus, a messy divorce was perhaps inevitable, and Donner was fired in favor of director Richard Lester.  Unfortunately for Lester and the Salkinds, several major players refused to cooperate with the new director: Gene Hackman flatly declined to shoot any scenes with Lester, and Composer John Williams also quit in protest of Donner's firing.  To make matters worse, in order to get credit as director of Superman II, Lester discarded much of Donner's footage and re-filmed entire sequences.  Incredibly, the discarded footage included scenes with Marlon Brando as Jor-El.  To avoid having to pay Brando for his work on the second film, the Salkinds elected to discard the scenes of Jor-El in Superman II, and even removed Brando from the opening \\"recap\\" summarizing the original movie.  Any of these factors- a switch in directors, the cobbling together of scenes filmed two years apart by different directors, the excision of scenes featuring an important character played by one of the greatest actors of all time- could easily have resulted in a train wreck of a movie.  However, in spite of these factors- and, it must be said, to the credit of Lester and the Salkinds- Superman II was, by anyone's standards, a complete success.  Some fans and some film critics (Roger Ebert, for example) view Superman II as being superior to the first film.   However, many fans wanted to see Donner's deleted scenes and his overall vision for Superman II.  After years of petitions, Warner Bros. granted fans their wish, and we have Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut.  I view the Richard Donner Cut as the superior version of Superman II for the following reasons:  1.  *The return of Marlon Brando*  Marlon Brando's Jor-El was a crucial part of the first film- both encouraging Superman to be the hero that he became, and warning his son never to interfere in Earth's history.  Besides giving the first movie some needed gravitas, the scenes between father and son provided many of the themes that gave the film emotional resonance.  By contrast, I felt the scenes with Superman's mother (Susannah York) in the original version of Superman II, while emotional and poignant in their own right, never seemed to quite fit in with the themes established in the first film.  By restoring Brando and Jor El into the sequel, the film really feels like a continuation of the first film.  Brando gives a strong performance again as Jor-El.  Without giving away too many spoilers, I have to say that the scene in which the de-powered Superman returns to the Fortress of Solitude with his \\"tail between his legs\\" after rejecting his father's advice not to relinquish his powers, and is then restored by Jor-El, is one of the most powerful scenes in any of the Superman movies.  That scene alone is worth the price of this DVD in my humble opinion, and how the Salkinds could have rejected it to save on the budget defies belief.  2.  *A more mature tone to the film*  As much as I have always enjoyed the original cut of Superman II, I always viewed several scenes as a bit \\"off\\":  the slapsticky scenes involving Non and the invasion by the Phantom Zone villains of their first city on Earth, the goofy gags during the Metropolis battle, Superman throwing an \\"S\\" net from his chest, etc.  These Lester-directed scenes have been removed, and in their place we have a more threatening, sinister version of the Phantom Zone villains, a more brutal battle in Metropolis, and a showdown in the Fortress between Superman and General Zod that is now more cerebral and strategic (and thus, more interesting in my humble opinion) than physical.  3.  *The return of John Williams*  No, John Williams was not brought in to record new music for Superman II (how neat would that have been?!), but Editor Michael Thau (one of the unsung heroes of this project who helped bring the Richard Donner Cut to fruition) has incorporated the John Williams soundtrack from the original film into Superman II.  The results are nothing less than astounding.  After watching the original version of Superman II with Ken Thorne's soundtrack, I think most fans will be astounded by how Williams' soundtrack enhances many scenes in Superman II.  I will provide one small example: the scene with the astronauts on the moon when the first astronaut spots Ursa flying to the lunar surface.  The inclusion of Williams' soundtrack gives the scene a new eerie, mysterious quality that it lacked before.   In fairness, I will point out the two missteps that the Richard Donner Cut makes:  1.  *They took out the \\"General, would you care to step outside?\\" line*  A relatively minor omission, but Donner and Thau should have known that that line of dialogue is now in the Superman lexicon.  2.  *The removal of the patriotic original ending to Superman II & the re-use of the original film's ending*  Superman stands for truth, justice, and the American Way, and the original ending to Superman II where Superman returns the fallen American flag to the White House and vows to the President that he will not fail humanity again was PERFECT.  You can watch that scene a dozen times and it will bring a smile to your face every time.  (Minor spoiler) The Richard Donner Cut decides to re-use the \\"turning back time\\" trick of the original film so that Superman can erase the destruction caused by the Phantom Zone villains and Lois Lane's knowledge of his secret identity.  I realize that Donner would almost certainly have come up with a better resolution than the \\"Super Kiss\\" used by Superman in the original version to erase Lois' memory if he had been retained as director, but Superman's turning back time rendered the original ending at the White House impossible.  For this reason alone, I feel Donner should have swallowed his pride and retained Lester's \\"Super Kiss\\" resolution- or, better yet, simply ended the movie with Superman allowing Lois to know his secret identity.  At the very least, we still get Superman (posing as a regular human) getting revenge on Rocky, the trucker bully, at the diner after Rocky beat up the de-powered Clark Kent earlier in the film.  So is Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut perfect?  No.  Why am I giving it five stars, then?  Because I felt that the original Superman II was a five-star movie, and I think the Richard Donner Cut is even better than the original Superman II.  Had Richard Donner been retained as Director, and been given the opportunity to shape a proper ending to the film, I think Superman II could have ended up being THE greatest superhero movie of all time.  As it stands, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is a wonderful movie that should not be missed by Superman fans or fans of superhero/action movies in general.

B0016KJKIG|4.0|The only negative thing I have to say is that the Velcro patch seems weak and i'm sure after some hard use it will wear out. Otherwise it fits the tool snug and has an extra pocket for a bit kit and bit extender. A great carry method, however not a huge fan of the hole at the bottom of the sheath,its meant to be carried in the open position... whatever I don't like that a whole lot. I would advise that in addition to the Velcro that Leatherman could add a snap button fastener
0374275637|3.0|this book is revealing in current times, however, the theory of authors was beautifully presented by montaigne's essaies hundreds of years ago in the style of poetical verse. but, it is indeed good book being published right now to review this: not much has changed during the last five hundred years. we are still who we were. we should celebrate star scholars, but don't forget to thank the old,dead giants.

B0041KKYGA|4.0|I always accepted the idea that Shakespeare wrote his own plays, and considered anything to the contrary to be merely speculation not fact.  So, the premise-what if Shakespeare never wrote a word, I found not to be appealing.<br /><br />Upon reading some good reviews, I decided to see it, and found it to be a high quality production and a wonderful experience. Director Roland Emmerich  previously directed 2012, and Independence Day, and writer John Orloff previously wrote some episodes of Band of Brothers, and as you watch this movie you will realise this term  BoB originated with Shakespeare.<br /><br />Anonymous proposes the Earl of Oxford wrote all the plays, anonymously donated them to Ben Johnson, a well known writer of the time for him to take credit. Then an uncouth illiterate actor, named Shakespeare steps in to claim the credit.  The peer remained anonymous for reasons of social acceptability.<br /><br />Another reason he may have remained anonymous which I totally loved was the parallel structure between what happened in the plays, and the real life events of the courtiers and Queen Elizabeth. Cecil, the courtier villain in this movie is a hunchback (historical fact), and brother in law of the Earl of Oxford. Richard 3 in Shakespeare's play is a hunchback, so the play becomes a social satire.<br /><br />A scene where a man is stabbed through a curtain mirrors a scene in Hamlet. A usurped heir is sent to Ireland, and there is a plot to kill him, similar to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Hamlet.<br /><br />Emmerich's direction gives Anonymous a much grander scope. We have big set pieces, such as a rebel attack on a bridge leading to the tower of London, rowing a boat in the Thames with the London skyline looming behind, an aerial shot of a huge crowd in the snow, and visual scenes of quite unsanitary London of the time, and he evokes the period very well. For example it rains on the actor in the theater, as he recites his lines.  Certain scenes play out in ways we have not scene before, particularly Hamlet's soliloquy where he holds a knife, Richard 3 as caricature, crowd interaction and participation, sweet talking bawdy ladies with Shakespeare's words. I loved this. Visually outstanding, with exquisite and intricate costumes.<br /><br />I liked the lead actors charisma and presence. He was so in character and looked older for the part that I did not recognise him till the credits. Rhys Ifans starred in Notting Hill, and Pirate Radio.  He does a terrific job, perhaps his best work, as does the actor who plays Johnson.  There is a particular scene between the two of them at the end that makes me tear up even as I write.  Derek Jacobi, begins and ends the movie opening and closing the premise.<br /><br />Vanessa Redgrave plays the doddering confused queen, and her daughter Joely Richardson plays her younger self, who has a torrid affair with the Earl of Oxford when she was young, producing an illicit heir. The queen has several torrid affairs which become part of the plot of succession. Shakespeare was played by Rafe Spall, son of Timothy Spall, who you have probably seen in several movies.<br /><br />If the screenwriter was hoping to persuade me,  he certainly made me think. Perhaps he goes too overboard with Shakespeare having a unique form of illiteracy, he can read words and memorise them but he can't write, and yet he is a scheming manipulative lout, a criminal, a drunkard, a successful entrepreneur, and a sociopath.  Asked to speak to a crowd he stumbles inarticulately over his words. If Shakespeare was as inarticulate, and uneducated as portrayed, how could he have convinced anyone of his genius when he lacked the most basic skills of expression.<br /><br />If not Shakespeare, then who?<br /><br />I did some online research.  Apparently, almost two centuries passed before anyone seriously questioned Shakespeare's authorship.  It has been suggested that Sir Francis Bacon wrote these plays, but why would an already famous writer give credit to someone else.  DeVere appears to be the current favorite among conspiracy theorists.  If DeVere was excluded from the court, as he is in the movie then he would not be in a position to satirise the court, or include such pointed commentary in his plays.  DeVere as a child in the movie performs a piece from Midsummer nights dream for the queen. He could hardly have written it as an adult then, could he?Curiously, at times the movie appears to undermine its own premise.<br /><br />It has been suggested that Sir Thomas North, [[ASIN:146370366X North of Shakespeare: The True Story of the Secret Genius Who Wrote the World's Greatest Body of Literature]], wrote the materials on which some of Shakespeare's plays were based.<br /><br />He did translate Plutarch which Shakespeare used as a source in several plays such as Julius Caesar, Troilus and Cressida, Coriolanus, and Anthony and Cleopatra, adapting them for the stage, converting the words from prose to verse. According to this book, Shakespeare purchased North's works, and then adapted them from the page to the stage.  In some cases the corresponding passages in Shakespeare are word for word what was written by North. Somehow North did not get credit.  Rosalinde from As You Like It apparently is Elisa Nord, (north)North's daughter.<br /><br />Hamlet was adapted from a centuries old story called Amleth, and had several iterations, including Dial of Princes by North. Shakespeare made numerous changes to the original story  Amleth, making it way darker according to a book I read [[ASIN:0826480373 Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories]].<br /><br />In the movie Ben Johnson proclaims sincere affection for DeVere's language skills.<br />In reality, Ben Johnson famously said of Shakespeare: \\"he would... buy the reversion of old plays,\\"but then mark not whose 'twas first: and after-times may judge it to be his...\\"Epigram no.56.<br /><br />The movie claims no manuscript written by Shakespeare survives. If you don't have evidence that Shakespeare wrote something, does that mean you have evidence someone else wrote it?  You cannot infer alternative authorship from a negation, only from evidence. If you have evidence that these plays were previously written, and performed or were adapted from books, then you can verify that Shakespeare was not the originator, merely wrote a version, and credit the original source.  It seems that with some of these plays, they were circulating already, and then Shakespeare wrote a version, or made his own adaptation, which then became the definitive version.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, this movie will stimulate debate and controversy.  The idea that he didn't write a single word goes too far in my opinion, it would be interesting to know for sure what he did and did not write.  I do think this is one of the best movies I have seen all year.<br /><br />Wherever you stand on this,  I highly recommend you see it, consider it, and form your own opinion.  For me, it's too tabloidy to be taken seriously, the once virgin queen now a nympho, having an illegitimate son with the real Shakespeare, and so on.<br /><br />Even if like me you do not agree with the premise, you might be surprised to discover you still love the movie.<br /><br />I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.conspiracy theorists.

B004H4XJW6|5.0|Hello. My new night shift hours leave me with a lot of time on my hands. In addition to writing stories and working on animations and other personal projects (while tending to patients who come in for CT or MRI exams in the middle of the night, an average of one or two folks a night, more or less), I have oodles of time to catch up on my movie watching. I'm on an animation jag lately, and have purchased a few recent animations. Of those, this Megamind double-pack is one of my favorites.  The DVDs came on time, and work as advertised.  I am glad I made this purchase. It will entertain for a long time. Even my friends who don't usually watch animations enjoyed this motion picture.
B005LJITS0|1.0|Terrible writing.  The actors do what they can, but their performances are lacking, especially under directing that feels like it's just following the formula.  Skarsgaard does the best job.  Reynolds is charming, but his character isn't.  It's hard to care what happens.  Save your money.
0446585025|5.0|The book was FANTASTIC!  I read it in two afternoon and evenings.  Gave it to my daughter and she read it in two days too.  She  loved the book! I also bought the other two Ellen books for my daughter.  She is so excited!
1451629184|5.0|I read this book when my 14 year old daughter asked me if she could read it.  At first, I just read the cover and looked for reviews for age related content.  I was nervous and I didn't find any definitive answers so I dove in.  This is a very raw book about the author's experiences.  She does a fantastic job of keeping flow where I would not have been able to continue writing.    I had a very hard time telling my daughter that she could read the book but I also could not say no. The pages reveal a lot of ugly and scary things about Jaycee captors,  but they also reveal the true beauty in Jaycees heart.  I feel strongly that people have a lot to learn from both.  I informed my daughter that if she did read the book, we would have to discuss all the difficult parts to make sure she didn't internalize them too much.  As I have said, there are very important lessons that live in these pages but I also know that empathy can cause pain and I need to help my daughter balance what she reads and what she feels. Ultimately, I think that Jaycees is a fantastic role model and an amazing woman.  I appreciate her honesty about everything that she went through then and what she goes through today.    After giving my daughter permission to read the book, so far, she has not been able get past the abduction.  I can't say I am sad about that.  It is not a book that I will pressure her to read in any way, however, I am very glad that I read it.  Jaycee has touched a part of my heart and helped me to see more beauty in life.  I strongly recommend this book to all adults and I think it can be a good read for teens with guidance.

B001OSIV62|5.0|First of all, I love Phillipe's (the main character) accent.<br /><br />I also like how they show real videos and pictures of him wire-walking  between the twin towers. The fact that the performance was separated into different parts of the video therefore giving the documentary a plot not in chronological order, only made watching the video a much more alluring experience.<br /><br />Phillipe described his life as a wire-walker, particularly, his experience with the twin towers in such a vivid fashion that it was a challenge for me to unglue my eyes from the monitor. I'm sure other viewers would feel similarly. The video includes several of Phillipe's close friends and team members for the twin tower expedition (most fall into both categories) who enrich the viewing by providing their thoughts and feelings about Phillipe and his passions. Phillipe also portrays his philosophical views verbally and  nonverbally throughout the video which I personally found very interesting.<br /><br />I would recommend this documentary to any and all who are interested in things like philosophy, particularly disobedience, adventure, and simply a good watch. It is quite an inspirational story.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Ok, for starters, let me just say that I knew this movie would not be BBC's 5 hour long movie which in my opinion is the best version out there, and I knew that it would be much more condensed. I was fine with that, really. I teach British Lit in high school and I was really looking forward to being able to show my students a Pride and Prejudice movie, instead of just small clips.  But after the first five minutes of watching this, I knew there was no way I was going to show this in class. The list of reasons for that is so long, I won't be able to list them all, so I'll try to do a better job of condensing them than this movie did.  1. The characters themselves were not true to the book at all. Elizabeth Bennett is probably my favorite character of all time. She's lively, finds humor in just about everything, extremely intelligent considering she had virtually no schooling, and a natural wit that could rival any scholar. In the movie, she's a hissing, snarling bad-tempered thing with a chip on her shoulder. The writers seemed to take her propensity to find humor in others' ill behavior and twist it into making fun of just about everyone.   And then there was Mr. Darcy...ok, I knew going into this that I probably wouldn't like this rendtion more than Colin Firth's, but I had an open mind and was willing to give him a chance. And he wasn't all that bad, but paired with Keira Knightley's portrayal of Elizabeth, this movie just spun off into a ditch.  Mr. Bennett is a private, well-humored man stuck in a bad marriage. He is not whipped as he appears to be in this movie. The fact that the writers changed up a lot of the lines he had in the book to \\"modernize\\" the movie, did nothing to aid his character in the least.  2. The movie moves along way too fast. Again, I know it couldn't be five hours, but this was just ridiculous. The actors spoke so fast that even I, a hardened P&P veteran who could quote just about any line in the book had a hard time following the dialogue.  For instance, the scene at Rosings when Elizabeth, the Collinses (and Maria Lucas if her character had not been cut from the movie) are dining with Lady Catherine, the dialogue went so fast I almost got whiplash. Judi Densch had the potential to be the best Lady Catherine of all time in fact I was really excited about seeing her in this movie, but her screen time was cut so short, her lines so diluted that it's extremely easy to forget her. And believe me when I say that Jane Austen did not write Lady Catherine de Bourgh in a way that would make her so easily forgottten.  3. They cut out too many supporting characters, ie Mr. and Mrs. Hurst (Mr. Bingley's sister and brother-in-law), The Forsters, Mr. and Mrs. Phillips (Mrs. Bennett's sister and brother-in-law), and Lady and Maria Lucas. Again I know that time was a constraint, but all of these characters actually do play a vital role in the book.   4. And finally the BIGGEST complaint I have about this movie is Darcy's first proposal scene. Not only is not in Charlotte's Parlor and in the middle of Hunsford's grounds in a random gazebo structure in the rain (I guess to make it more \\"dramatic\\"), Mr. Darcy goes on to explain everything right then and there. Which I tell you right now is something Fitzwilliam Darcy would NEVER have done. He's too prideful, hence the title of the book/movie.   There was no letter, no suspense as the audience watched Elizabeth come to realize that everything she knew about Wickham was wrong and what everyone seemed to think of her family's behavior in general. One of my favorite parts of the book is where Mr. Darcy storms out of the Collinses parlor and Elizabeth is left fuming. And then there's the awkwardness with which he delivered the letter to her. Instead, I was the only one left fuming as I watched Elizabeth practically throw herself at Darcy after his explaination and by that point I actually shut off my DVD player and took a break. I could not believe that anyone could butcher such a great book so effectively.   In conclusion, this movie is HORRENDOUS! The only thing this movie did better than the BBC version is that characters are actually much more pleasing to look at, but that's it. Jane Austen is probably rolling around in her grave right now because these people just ripped her work to shreds.  And the worst part is, I now have students coming in every year that think they know all there is to know about Pride and Prejudice, but when they actually start to read the book they start asking questions like... \\"Wait, who's Maria Lucas?\\" and \\"What happened to the Gazebo?\\", and \\"Where the hell did this letter come from?\\" and \\"Wait, Bingley has another sister?\\" and my absolute favorite, \\"Why is Elizabeth so nice?\\" It's gotten to the point where I have to give a disclaimer at the start of each year, telling them that in no way shape or form should they watch this movie if they haven't already, and if they have they should forget everything.   Do not let your children watch this movie. Please. You'll be doing a favor to every English teacher out there. You want to watch a Pride and Prejudice movie that isn't 5 hours long, but still relatively accurate, watch the 1970s version or even the 1940s version. Acting's not quite as good, but they still top this movie about 100 times over. If I could've given this movie 0 stars and still reviewed, I would have.

B005SV9X22|4.0|This is a great capture of the two year long, Monster Ball Tour.<br />I'm not going to \\"compare\\" Lady Gaga to her peers but I would like to say, what I feel makes her stand-out is her ability to connect with her audience.  She does this by sharing stories and humanizing herself throughout the show.  This rare ability puts Lady Gaga at a level all her own.  She reminds us that shes a human being just like everyone in the crowd and that even when no one else believed in her, she believed in herself.  The other aspect that makes Lady Gaga standout from her peers is her technical talent....she CAN REALLY SING!  Her voice is powerful and emotive. She also plays the piano amongst other instruments.  Gaga is a musicians musician and a pop star rolled into one.<br /><br />Anyway, this show is half Broadway, half rock show, and a whole lot of entertaining.  Several interludes are cut from the show and my personal thought is that maybe getting the rights to the samples used in those interludes were too expensive.  The opening track, containing samples of \\"Finally\\" by Cece Peniston, was really awesome and I was sad not to see it.  I'm taking off one star because I don't like a show to be altered or not fully captured when a dvd is released.<br /><br />Overall, great show.  If you missed it, definitely go see her live when you can.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|Pointless matching with a beat-the-clock bit and a candy theme - that's all there is here.  20 levels? Not hardly: every so often the game announces that you have moved up a level, but that's all that happens - nothing else changes, gameplay remains exactly the same for all 20 &quot;levels&quot;. And yes, I played them all in one straight 45 minute sitting - that's all it took.  So if that works for you, grab this while it's free; it's barely worth $.99, let alone $2.99.
B000YGEE48|5.0|I just came on Amazon to try to remember the song mentioned in above review, thanks for providing it.  \\"Yours\\",  this is a tremendous ballad over love gone ,  when I was .....Yours, sung with every ounce of depth, experience you could wish for by Ms. D.,  and you'll heare it only on this album , incredibly ,  never heard it on the radio when album was released, but of course the title cut was played to death, but that was always pleasurable to listen to the incredible singing of Dionne .  The instumental backdrops to all songs are all classic B.Gee's.  I was surprised that the Gibb's gave this material to Ms Warwick and didn't keep for themselves,  but they knew they had the right combination when they chose each other. Kudos to all concerned for such wise musical decisions.  The rest of the cuts on album aren't far behind these two gems ... 30 yrs later ,  haven't heard in while ,  but remember this album quite well,  my cassette copy of it was in tatters by time I got done playing it so much for all the reasons cited in other reviews and more ,  it just amazes ,  especially the vocals ,  way to go Ms. Warwick and Gibb brothers for bringing her back for her greatest album. Considering all the classic's she's had , that's saying something.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|I swore I would never read another fantasy series after the mess that was (is?  who cares?) the wheel of time, that goes around and around and around... But I gave the first one a shot and WOW! AWESOME! BEST EVER! I loved it, as I did the 2nd and 3rd in the series. But, AFFC is painfully boring and plodding. I'm struggling to finish it and wonder if I have been sucked into another money machine of an unending series. Blah!  Is the next one the last?
0312576463|3.0|A short review, certainly not exhaustive.  The first 250 pages and the last two sections are terrific. The middle is long and seems like work to read.  Reminiscent of Updike's Rabbit books, Tolstoy and unalike unhappy families, and other sagas of time, this book shows through families that have disfunction that reverberates into next generations, through chosen social and political causes, and through sex, the many ways a free society's inhabitants can get it wrong or right.  What good is freedom if it is misused or causes manic clashes? What good is sexual freedom if confusion and objectification replace morality, faithfulness, and love? One man's moral quest to save the birds or worry about overpopulation or the environment may interfere with another's freedom to live his life by his own choices. The societal or political observations often get replicated in family interactions and choices in the book.  Bottom line - so far I think Franzen may be an optimist. Perhaps his \\"happy?\\" ending is telling us that we may be a muddled country, and we may get a lot wrong, but in the end because we are a free country,  we often work things out and get many things more right than any other country in the world. Perhaps Franzen would shudder at my conclusion. That would be his problem. That is what I concluded having read his book.
B0011UF79C|3.0|why does genetically almost perfect mean no laughs, eh? no one looked like they were having ANY fun, no way the future is gonna elim chuckle time, what about babies??? loved the gas station and the batman sounding cars, the 3 stories of steps Jude has to climb in a highly sophisticated architecturally futuristic, hmnmm sadistic apartment, those undetectable HUGE contact lenses, but nary a skin flake to evade exposure, and what is with the TWENTY MIN treadmill on level ZERO and VINCENT dying in the locker room BUT swimming 6miles with bro in tow for 3 is a no brainer... and why would you need TWELVE fingers to excel at piano, and well, the list is quite long and distinguised.  I did not understand why they have the capability to extend ur height but the back injury, IMPOSSIBLE!! yikes, luved Jude as per usual in any form, but burn baby burn vs good drugs...nonsense! and what about that propulsion technology, they could only head to Titan every SEVENTY years, which translates to 1960's fuel restrictions, ack, didn't this bug anyone? whole premise of film is based on murder of NASA budget slasher type, sooooo.... anyhow, 3 stars for that bedroom wallpaper in Uma's room, soooo kewl, very creative, and am a sad gusher for Ethan's dreamy eyes... lotsa potential here, gackatha
B004SBQAN8|2.0|I'm glad this has been released on DVD: watching a movie this bland in a cinema without being able to mock it out loud was excruciating. It looks and feels like a TV pilot for a series aimed at fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but without any of Joss Whedon's flair for characterisation and dialogue, and with a premise that might have been copied from a Scientology pamphlet.<br /><br />On the plus side, the villainous Mogadorians and CGI monsters look passably cool, and it provided employment for Timothy Olyphant and some Australian actors. I hope they all manage to live it down, but it's sufficiently forgettable that they probably will.<br /><br />Having been persuaded to watch this by a teenage relative who has since apologized, we did our best to keep ourselves awake (insert Mogadorian/Mogadon joke here) by providing our own commentary, but what this really needs to make it entertaining is the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 crew.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|To all the purist  I say stick to your VHS  copies. If your a true fan you will enjoy these Blu-Ray versions of the Star Wars Trilogy. Color is great sound is everything you always wanted and all the added extras brings some life to this amazing series. Again if your not an open minded person then don't get in line for this thrill ride.
B004NSULHM|5.0|King of Limbs puts me back in mind of In Rainbows.  Haunting, melodic melodies and off kilter rhythms make this the perfect album to play low and relax or to turn up and dance to.  For Radiohead fans, this is a great addition to their body of work and a must have for any collection.  Enjoy
B005P39GOI|4.0|I just discovered this album and I love it but I wish the US album version had as many tracks as were released in France (16 tracks including some live tracks for under 10 euros).  Hope they re-release the album in the US with all of the tracks.  I am sure the UK version has 16 tracks. Oh well.
B0050PYNOY|4.0|I really liked the movie and found it very funny. If you have young children or are uncomfortable with blue(adult) humor, you may wnat to pass this movie by.
0938045695|5.0|While looking for a new direction with my physical training I stumbled across this book at a major chain bookstore. As kettlebells and Pavel where completed unknown to me at the time, I decided to read the book first and then begin my training if I was still interested. This book changed everything for me in the gym. Now three years on I am still a practioner of the lessons taught in this book with outstanding results. If I had to recommend one tool for working out, it would be the kettlebell. If I had to recommend one book to explain how to do it, it would be this book. BOTTOM LINE: Worth every penny.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I pre-order all Grisham's books - he is on my must read list.  I was disappointed in The Litigators.  Very slow starting - I kept turning pages waiting for that hook, that \\"I can't put this down\\" feeling.  The book ultimately delivers some laughs and the courtroom scene we expect in a Grisham offering, but it failed to live up to his reputation.  Average at best, and I expect more from John Grisham.
B00122V6OE|2.0|This review is of the esoteric sound recording quality of this release. No one doubts the quality of the songs themselves.<br /><br />I just wasted $9 on the so-called remastered version download of Presto. Initially, Amazon had confusing labeling showing the MP3 download to be remastered. It was not. The labeling was changed after I made the purchase. I am hoping the 2013 Japanese remaster I just ordered will be the one!<br /> The remasters of the oldest of the catalog are definitely worth it. For example, I purchased 2112, Exit Stage Left, Hemispheres, Hold Your Fire, Signals and Power Windows. (Vapor Trails is a compressed mess). All were worthy of repurchase. The two \\"Presto\\" cuts that are on the 2009 Retrospective CD sound great. Hopefully the 2013 Wea/Japanese will sound just as good..UPDATE COMING SOON.<br /><br />  UPDATE: The Japanese Import remaster sounds no better than the original 1984 recording. I wish they had made the whole album sound like the two cuts on the 2009 Retrospective.
0765357151|4.0|This book is worth your time. I would say that the movie, although great, was loosely based on this book. Great read just before Halloween. Enjoyable, and thought provoking.<br />The other short stories included left a little to be desired, in my humble opinion.
0857685627|4.0|I really enjoy this book, but it's not the be-all and end-all tome of Halo art they'd have you think. It's not a bad book by any means, it has a ton of great work in it, but coming from all of the other Halo books out there that feature art, I felt like this was a bit scattershot, more or less a grab bag of content. My biggest issue is that in an attempt to touch on as many facets of the entire franchise as it can, it leaves a lot of stones unturned and isn't very comprehensive.  Other books such as the Art of Halo, (which features Halo and Halo 2), the Art of Halo 3, the Halo Graphic Novel art section, the art section in the limited edition Halo: Reach strategy guide, and even the Halo Encyclopedia, tend to do a better job or show off the better work.  It's definitely worth a purchase, especially for Halo fans, but I regard it more as supplementary content than anything else. If you want to take a look at what I think is a perfect artbook in terms of layout and content, check out the Art of District 9. That's 160 pages for ONE film, versus 190 pages for the whole of the Halo franchise, IE 6 games and other content. Hard to do Halo justice in so few pages in my opinion, but it's a worthy attempt.
B000YHKBTY|5.0|Just well might be my long lost LP. I lost my record album over 16 yrs. ago. Along with other ones. I finally bought and rebought this on CD this year. Up until this year I didn't want to pay the price of about $35 for the sealed one in the stores. My first copy of The Wall on CD I got for $25 used. Traded it, and the few other Pink Floyd CDs for a rare metal compilation telling myself it would easier getting the Floyd back. Again, I rebought all the Floyd I had this year again. I did find The Wall sealed in the store for $24. I have not played the new CD's in this Shrunkin version of my long lost album. Before I got it I was wondering if when I opened it, it was gonna be like the album in this respect(YES,LIKE THE ALBUM, THERE WAS NO PRINT,LOGO,on the cover.)The other,regular jewel box versions have PINK FLOYD/THE WALL Printed on the cover. After I got this mini LP, I saw it going for an extremely lower price. I was dissapoited at what I was seeing. Did I get ripped off? I still don't belive so. This is just one of those special albums I had to have on mini. Maybe those cheaper ones don't have the original blank cover(When you bought the album in the store it looked like there was the PF logo and album title on it, but when the shrink wrap came off a piece of paper fell out with logo on it and not the cardboard/actual cover). If you got the money and you love this album buy it.But don't try putting it on your turntable. You ought to never even open it up. I had to open it I just like how these little LP cd's feel. YEAH!!!THEY'RE CUTE..REMEMBER..THEY MAKE GREAT GIFTS TOO..CHRISTMAS IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER!!
B00004R9A4|3.0|I can see why the original theatrical release had songs and scenes cut to reduce the length.  This is a cute story, but pacing is rather slow.  Until they get to the mix of animation and live acting, it plods along.  'Portobello Road' is excruciatingly long.  Still, it's good, clean family entertainment and a good film to own.
B004EPZ08E|1.0|I was so disappointed with this movie -- 75% of it was just bad and it moved slow-- I expected more from this cast.  I am now trying to give this movie away and it keeps coming back to me.
B0036TGT3E|3.0|The movie is wonderful, nice packaging, etc....<br /><br />However, beware that if you don't have a 3D TV then don't even bother buying this version.  Just get the regular DVD.  I can't understand why they don't just also include a \\"regular\\" 3D version w/glasses for the majority of us who do not own a 3D tv with all new 3D releases.  It was a total waste of money.
0446547654|2.0|The Notebook is my very favorite movie. I never read the book, but was hoping for the moving experience I felt from the Notebook.  Was very let down....$12.99 for another Danielle Steele type plot that was so predictable it was sad.  This author made money I am sure from his name, but I highly doubt this is a work he is proud of from a literary prospective.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I just love Barbra Streisand and nave nearly all her CDs and DVDs and have had Duets fpr at least one year and of course her work requires  stars each and every time Joyce Maric
1575666286|4.0|If you're already on board with the Gerson Therapy, don't need further convincing, and simply want the information about what to do and how the therapy works, then another Gerson book might be a better choice. This one has all of that information, still, but it is peppered with too many anecdotes and testimonials of people who were cured of their conditions. I haven't read other Gerson books, so I can't offer an alternate recommendation.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I guess there are countless reviews saying how addictive this game is. At the beginning I didn´t understand people talking about it, until I tried it for myself. Super cool, but I had to delete it from my phone if I wanted to have a life and have things done when I´m at home after work.
B00003CWN3|1.0|BY THE WAY AWESOME MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IT PLENTY TIMES, BUT DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND GO TO WALMART OR TARGET TO GET IT. I ORDERED THE MOVIE AFTER A MONTH OF NOT RECIEVING ANYTHING FINALLY CONTACTED THE SALER, NEVER GOT A TRACKING # NO NOTHING ALL THEY HAD TO SAY WAS WERE NOT HERE TO TAKE PPL MONEY \\"WHAT\\" well cleary you did after back and forth emails I just wanted my money after 2weeks I finally got my refund, actually had nerves to offer a comp movie and to no surprise I never herd nor did nothin ever come these ppl are a joke in this case save your self a headache n juz go to the store

B000AGTPUK|5.0|My mom loves this movie so much. I actually ended up getting it as a present. Arrived on time, in package, all looks good.
B005W8SNNG|3.0|If I could give this movie a \\"pretty good\\" 3.5 stars I would. I'm a fan of Cameron, Justin, and Jason and the previews made this one of those movies that I felt I absolutely HAD to see. The first half of the movie was honestly very disappointing. It was boring and the scenes were so choppy. It was like...here is scene 1. Now scene 2. Now scene 3 and none of the scenes flowed or came together. I barely laughed in the first half. The Christmas scene and onward is when things picked up and I began to enjoy the movie. There was much more humor and it was fun seeing what the bad teacher would do next. Nothing was off limits for her. For me, the awful beginning and awesome ending cancels out so it's an \\"okay\\" movie at worst and \\"good\\" at best.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I love this show, I got this box set for my sister for Christmas (early...). I can't wait for Christmas so we can break it open. Comes in the cool box like the picture and everything!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It is one of the few apps that you can see notes on excel because at my work that is how we get our schedule, it's great to be able to see it on my phone.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. This is BY FAR my favorite Christmas movie. I've already watched it 6 times this month and it's only 10/29/11. Don't judge me.
B005DR64OQ|3.0|It's not art, but it is a movie that entertained me. I don't understand why it didn't do better, I guess if it doesn't have a throw up/puking scene in it or the approved PC agenda scenes (at least one) then a movie doesn't do well.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game works best with four players but also works with two or three.  It's easy to learn - your pieces can only connect to each other at the corners, and you try to play all your pieces and go out before anyone else does - and it keeps getting more and more fun as you gain strategy. The game pieces are shiny and translucent and give the game eye appeal.  Great game...get it!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I'm surprised by the poor reviews, because my companion & I laughed or smiled about something each page (Kindle) - definitely worth my money & time in this crazy world!  I was a little hesitant to buy it but got a sample & decided to go for it.  I think it is better than her previous books.  Topics felt random & light-hearted, but there was wisdom & beauty for the taking.  The title says it all.  I could hear her voice when I read - it sounded like the way she talks on the Ellen show.  Great work Ms. Ellen!  Thank you
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Got this bag just about a week ago.  I love it, it holds everything.  I have 3 camcorders, a DSLR, 4 lenses, cd-rws, SD cards, I could go on and on.  It's solid, looks nice, and is so easy to carry.  It secures on your back for hiking or if your just like me and have 3 or 4 bags on your back at one time.  I will update if anything changes, but for the price you cannot beat it.  Even if it were more I'd still say good buy.
159420229X|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation from a friend and am extremely glad I did.  Joshua Foer had covered the US memory competition as a journalist and along the way met some characters that convinced him he too was capable of mastering the techniques used and was capable of competing as well as long as he spent the required time.  With strong self motivation the author embarked on journey of rigourous training, writing about the experience for the rest of us, and went on to actually win the US memory championship.  It is both a remarkable story as well as a highly informative read about memory and an overview of how it works.<br /><br />Moonwalking with Einstein is extremely balanced.  It is both entertainingly well written for the narrative and precisely stated for the sceintific.  I will go through the scientific briefly first.  The author goes through the science of memory throughout the book.  Humanity's use of memory has also changed substantially over time as a function of its needs.  In particular pre/post written word, pre/post printing press, pre/post digital age, all have had profound impacts on the need and use of our memory.  The author describes how our natural memory is far superior when it comes to our spatial and visual faculties.  People have known this for thousands of years and as a result figured out ways to use it to their advantage.  The author in particular used a method of memory dependent on using mental images of familiar physical buildings to place highly unique objects (associated with words that were the targets for memorization) and using the ordering of a path through the building as a visual means for recollection.  The description of his process and the science of memory are both instructive and highly informative.<br /><br />The narrative is even more fascinating than the science.  Joshua Foer is a journalist who by chance stumbled upon the US memory championships and in the chance encounter began an amazing personal journey that has no doubt propelled his career!  In the process of covering the memory championship he befriends Ed Cooke who helps propel him to decide to compete competitively and this book is a description of that journey.  One meets many remarkable and fascinating characters, from Ed himself to Tony Buzan to Daniel Tammet.<br /><br />Moonwalking with Einstein is a really refreshing form of journalism.  The book is easy to read, informative and engaging.  I found all parts of the book interesting and would have read the story or the science on its own but together it is a rare gem.  Highly recommended!
B004LZFWJO|4.0|This game works just like it's supposed to on my Droid x. Graphics are clear &amp; cutesy, game runs smoothly, &amp; the permissions don't cause mass hysteria. After yesterday's insane rantings, that itself earns this game a star!<br /><br />I really like the swiping aspect of this game. That's the one thing that sets it apart that makes me like it more than I probably would have had it been a run of the mill bejeweled style game. It just helps the game flow better.<br /><br />The one thing I do wish was different about this game is that they should give you a definite goal. As it is right now, you just play until time runs out. I guess the goal is to beat your previous score?  To me that's just not fun. I'd much rather be given a goal to work towards in an allotted amount of time...makes things more interesting.<br /><br />I definitely don't think this game is worth $2.99, but for the FAOTD it's just fine. Try it out &amp; see for yourself!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|My son loves all of the Fast and Furious Movies and I got this one for his Birthday. He and my dad both watched it a few times already. Great movie.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|There is a reason why people often cite this book as a \\"Must Read\\" for fans of apocalyptic/zombie fiction: it's one of the best. Regardless of your sub-genre of choice, you will enjoy this book. Max Brooks somehow figured out precisely what fans want in their zombie stories, and this is the result. Very well written and a must for a zombie fiction collector.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|I know this game is free today, but even for free its not worth the wasted space on my device
B00514HDNW|5.0|I don't know what to say about this novel other than that it's the best of the best. You are missing out if you haven't read it. It's a story that will haunt you for the rest of your life. In my opinion, it is nothing like the movie. I was not a fan of the movie. But the book is incredible. The only complaint I have is that it ended so soon. It was in an anthology with a couple other short novellas when I first read it years ago, and I was so disappointed when I reached the end unexpectedly because I thought I still had a few hundred pages to go!<br /><br />Definitely one of the top gems of the horror fiction trade.
0316044938|1.0|This book should have been classified as a \\"young adult\\" novel, not adult fiction. The writing is larded with dreadful cliches and pedestrian observations. If the author had not used the \\"novel\\" device of dead girl as narrator, this book would have attracted no notice whatsoever. That's the only bit of originality, and a slender reed it is.

B000001GQY|5.0|In my opinion, Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 2 is one of the most powerful piano concertos ever written, and the Gilel/ Jochum performance really illustrated the immense tragedy, the sheer majesty, and the pure force of this masterpiece. Right from the start, when the first notes of the horn signal the tender first chords of the piano (which were played without any rush), I knew it was going to be an epic performance. Gilels plays the first cadenza as if every note counted, while other pianists tend to rush through certain notes/chords. Following the passionate cadenza is an equally passionate orchestra led by Eugene Jochum. If the first three minutes wasn't amazing enough, just take a listen to the rest of the first movement, where both the orchestra and Gilels ruthlessly drive you to the edge of your seats. You'll see what I mean when you hear the second cadenza, where Gilels starts off immediately where the orchestra left off, pounding chord after chord of pure frenzied passion, proceeded by a release of weight - giving you 2 minutes of relief, when suddenly he proceeds to rip through the chords with a demonic temper. Cadenzas after cadenza, let Gilels show you what this masterpiece is all about.

B003SNJYSK|3.0|I simply find it annoying when an author does not check facts first before including historically inaccurate information. South Africa abolished the death penalty in 1995. Fact.
B00364K6YW|5.0|We initially got this for my wife, but I sat down and watched it with her this week--all 6 hours! It's split into 6 1-hour episodes, so it's easy to watch in smaller chunks if 6 hours is a bit much for one sitting. As far as the movie itself, it has great acting and a nice love story, such a refreshing break from so much of the sex and violence in most movies coming out nowadays.
0385344325|5.0|This is a great book to read as are all the Jack Reacher novels.  Lee Childs is a talented author.  Jack Reacher is an unforgettable character always on top of every situation that comes up.  You wish he were on your side. I always look forward to the next Reacher book.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|I can not believe it has been 5 years as of today that I had the privilege and blessing to watch this concert, and what a surprise that it was being filmed for TV and Video. It was an experience I will never forget. Probably the best experience of my life, and to think that right in the middle of DOWN WITH LOVE, there I am, with my arms extended up high cheering the best entertainer that ever lived. Thank you Miss Streisand, for letting me be part of your video, and part of that wonderful night in Sunrise, Florida where you more than raised the roof away of the BANKATLANTIC CENTER; I bet not even the Florida Panthers have caused such uproar in that venue in their entire franchise. 10/28/06 is a date for the record books in Florida and in my lifetime.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|1. Is it worth watching this horror flick? Yes.  2. Do I need to see the first one before I watch it? Not necesssarily, but better if you see that first, just to understand the story better.  3. Scarier than the first one? Yes. At times.  4. Which way this is better than the first? Slightly more violent at certain points. Character developement is lot better. Gradual increase in tension is superb and the male character is far more believable than Micah (the male charater in the first movie).  5. Which way this is worse than the first? Mainly the number of characters. The first one has just a couple, this one has the whole family, so there is a subtle feeling that we have many people in a haunted house (not just a lonely fella). This may bring down the tension for few, but the story makes it up.  Bottom line:  Watch this if you are a horror flick/PA fan. This has all the scary elements of the first, story is explained better, characters are more believable (guy in this movie is not extreme like the first one; doesnt act stupidly adamant throughout the movie). Nice scares throughout the movie and not just the repitition of the fist one. So, although the theme remains the same, PA2 still delivers all the chills of PA1 and still maintains its own identity. So, you will enjoy it no matter whether you see the first installment or not.
0307593312|1.0|I bought 1Q84 after reading a review on Amazon that lauded it.  What wasn't mentioned in the review that Amazon quoted was the overwhelming pornographic nature of the writing.  Often one who desires to limit the garbage that enters one's mind must skip paragraphs and ignore images directed at one.  But after 66 pages I have given up on 1Q84 because every character is obscene and garbage dominates the book.  To me, this is not good writing.  It is an imposition of perversion in one author's mind on his image of the world.  Moreover, that such content (perversion) is not commented on in a review that lauds the book speaks poorly to the morality of the \\"literati\\" who praise such a work in their quest to the display tolerant, broad-minded brilliance of one of their own (with considerable implied reflection on themselves) and in their self-imposed moral ignorance.  I wonder how tolerant and broad minded will they be in regard to this review.    If such literati who review books don't inform us of the actual content of a book perhaps we need an independent, non-invested agency to warn us.  Amazon has certainly not accepted such responsibility.  Experience teaches, if one will observe, that perversion leads not to good but to bad consequences.  Perversion in the name of art, like that encountered in 1Q84, is widely encountered and, indeed, is endorsed by its patrons far beyond literature alone to the point that it has now seeped into human attitudes toward the sanctity of God-established marriage between a man and a woman and toward the sanctity of innocent life itself.  Our mothers or at least our grandmothers knew better.  Perversion of good is evil itself, encountered from the beginning and allowed to exist to provide choice for us in exercising our free will.  Our response to such perversion has consequences beyond what we can now imagine.       If Amazon had included a morally competent review I would have saved the $16 I wasted.  Worse than that, my purchase will nodoubt be interpreted in the sales of the book as some kind of approval, as my one-star rating will be, which is not my intent.  I bought this book only because I was uninformed by a too-tolerant and ignorant reviewer who lauded it with no thought that the perverted content might be offensive.  He or she failed to inform and now I am left with garbage for which I paid $16 which I do not want in my home; nor will I give it away.  Burning seems to be the only appropriate solution.  I hope the neighbors don't mind the stench.    Barton E. Dahneke, PhD.

B004LZFWJO|2.0|Really  just not a fan of this game. I don't like the swipe part of it....  just not a game for me. Didn't notice any problems, looks nice.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Let me start out by saying this...There was only one flaw in this movie that I could think of. And that was the train scene at the end. Yes, i've read all of the books, and i'm not someone who tries to compare the movies and books. That being said, as a movie itself, I found it to be freaking awesome! Now, later on, I did compare it to the book, and it was the most loyal movie. There were a few different scenes, but I was fine with these changes. They even added the most epic scene when Harry says \\"Let's finish this the way we started it...TOGETHER!\\" And he pulls Voldemort off of the ledge with him. Overall, book fan or not, you'll enjoy this movie!
B003CH9PV8|5.0|I am so happy I downloaded this show's first season. I wanted to test my Tivo's VOD and choose this for the test. Wow, this show is fantastic. Such great multi-dimensional characters. Watch the first episode and you will be hooked. I sure was.
B000002KOO|5.0|\\"Then Play On\\" #109 in 1970 was there last recording with blues guitarist Peter Green.  For me this is there most accessible disc up to this point.  You get great songs in:  The hit \\"Oh Well\\" #55, loved the heavy rock that went into chamber music on the last half of the song. (The Rockets had a hit with song in 1979 hitting #30).  You also get  the blues-rock of \\"Rattle Snake Shake\\", the Santana sounding \\"Coming Your Way\\" and the hard charging \\"Searching For Madge\\".<br /><br />UPDATE:  2013 Deluxe remaster.  Enjoy this new deluxe disc.  *****.<br /><br />This deluxe remaster of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Then Play On\\", is a god send!  After 2 decades of the lackluster sounding original album, this baby gets an upgrade and with the original English track listing.  Finally we get \\"The Green Manalishi (With The Two Prong Crown)\\", one of Peter Green's ultimate classic's and \\"World In Harmony\\", on a titled CD.  Hope this sells well so they might release the other old titles, the great \\"Kiln House\\", the classic \\"Bare Trees\\" and the nice \\"Mystery To Me\\".  You can't go wrong here, buy it and enjoy!

B000K7VHQE|5.0|What I love about this film is the message that family will always be there for you. Yes, family life can be dysfunctional and family members can annoy you, but if you're lucky you will have some family members that support you even if their methods are skewed. The actors are also what made this movie a huge success. Greg Kinnear shines as a motivational speaker whose cliche sayings annoy everybody else and Alan Arkin is fabulous as a heroin snorting grandpa who dearly loves his granddaughter. The real star is Abigail Breslin who is one of the best child actors out there; she is perfect as the hopeful and innocent child who is more realistic and mature than her family members.
0062073486|4.0|This is the first book I have read by Agatha Christie and I can see why it is a classic of the murder mystery genre. Christie managed to make me suspect pretty much all of the characters at some point in the book...brilliantly done! However, like a lot of mystery novels, I'm not sure if there would be a very high re-read value.
0062073559|3.0|This was my first Hercule Poirot mystery, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The first half of the book was setup and seemed to drag a bit, but once the murder actually occurred the investigation and piecing together the evidence was very well-written and had enough twists and turns to keep me guessing until the end. I probably would have given this 4 stars if the setup hadn't taken so long...I much preferred Christie's \\"And Then there Were None.\\"<br /><br />As far as genius detectives go, Hercule Poirot was okay, but I much prefer Sherlock Holmes or Dupin at this point. Poirot is much more kind and personable than either of them, but I find their arrogance or lack of social skills more entertaining. Poirot also frequently uses French phrases which are never translated (I could figure out about 3/4 of them without resorting to a French-English dictionary) and I found this obnoxious rather than endearing.<br /><br />Overall: Great plot, mildly interesting main character, overly slow pacing
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Actually very useable, on samsung galaxy s its a little small but as complete as a full office program. Using it with swype is pretty easy while on the go or on a plane without the space for a laptop.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|This holder/stand works with both the iPhone (4G) and iPod touch (4G).  The clamp that grips your mobile device is pretty tight.  In fact, I think it's a bit too tight (too much tension on the spring).  It's actually not easy to get things in and out.  Reason for 4 rather than 5)<br /><br />But aside from this minor issue, everything else works pretty well.  As you can see from the picture, there's a butterfly screw that you use to lock in the arm's position.  With this, I'm able to lock the phone in a lot of different ways/angles and it works fairly well (not perfectly tight but pretty good).  This is good because maybe the stand is too tall so you need the phone to point down or the stand is too short so you need the phone to point up.  Each of the arms have extension poles.  But the poles work on friction so you can really only get 2 positions with confidence (all the way in or all the way out).  Still, this is pretty cool because the stand can fold away to some extent (pun intended).  The legs spread out so that you can hold the iPhone to the side (as in the picture).  But the legs can also come in if you don't want them to take up that much real estate.  But they do need to be fully extended for the side position.<br /><br />I think this would make a great \\"gag\\" gift for someone who might be into photography and has a small device like the iPhone or iPod.

1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs was the perfect Nietzschean Ubermensch ! This book is a rivetting read of the mercurial Jobs. Superbly written. It is not deferential to him and is true to the many facets of his personality.
1451648537|4.0|I was always fascinated by Steve Jobs however did not know about his personal side which had so many imperfections. In spite of them my views on him have not changed reading till the last page. A visionary and a mad genius who come maybe once in a few generations. The book was very fast paced, it may not have delved into every aspect and story that I might have wanted to know more in detail but then that's not always possible, the fact that it was a no holds official biography - gives the book authenticity and merit.

0345522478|4.0|Atticus is a 2000+ year old druid masquerading as a harmless young bookstore owner. He is under the dubious protection of the goddess Morrigan, who comes to warn him that his life is threatened. Atticus possesses the magic sword Fragarach. The god Aenghus Og wants the sword and has been tracking Atticus for centuries. When it becomes clear that Aenghus is now serious about killing Atticus, the druid is left to call for help from his varied list of friends. To my delight, we are then introduced to a cast of witches, werewolves, vampires, and gods. But most importantly we meet Oberon, Atticus's beloved dog and best friend.<br /><br />Positive Comments:<br /><br />Since I mostly read female-centered books, reading something told from a male perspective was different and refreshing. Atticus is a very well written character. At times you do get the impression that he is ancient and wise. Yet he has adapted well to modern times, has a sense of sarcasm and humor, and does not take himself too seriously. I also really liked the way that his druid powers were explained and utilized throughout the plot.<br /><br />As I said above, I loved the supporting cast of characters. Oberon makes a delightful sidekick. Atticus has two lawyers: one a vampire, and one a werewolf. I'll admit, they aren't well fleshed out in this particular novel, but I still found their presence in the story amusing. I enjoyed the way that the gods were portrayed: powerful, selfish, and out of place in the modern human world.<br /><br />There is a decent balance between world building and action within the plot. I never felt overwhelmed by information, and I was never bored. At the same time, I was never confused. To me this shows that the author has the ability to deliver information in a concise and entertaining manner.<br /><br />Negative Comments:<br /><br />As I said, I love the side characters, but Hearne walks a fine line in that he has so many of them. Having a large cast of characters can be fun, but it can also be confusing for readers. In addition, it means that each character might not be as thoroughly developed as you would hope. Several of them are introduced well into the book, and then set aside without being given full character arcs.<br /><br />This brings me to my second complaint, which is that this book is full of sequel bait. It doesn't have a cliffhanger, but there are a lot of loose ends. Don't get me wrong, I was already looking forward to reading book two, and this will no doubt motivate me to pick it up soon, but I like my books to be self contained and stand alone as much as possible.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this novel immensely. If you like urban fantasy, especially the kind filled with gods and magic, I highly recommend picking this one up. 4 stars.<br /><br />Originally reviewed for [...]ition, it means that each character might not be as thoroughly developed as you would hope.

B000002KD5|5.0|\\"Fleetwood Mac\\" #1 (1975).  In 1975 FM recruited 2 California musicians Lindsey Buckingham, guitar and vocals and Stevie Nicks, vocalist, they released an album in 1973 simply titled \\"Buckingham And Nicks\\" #80.  After the mediocre album \\"HOHTF\\", I would of never thought this would be as big a hit, it turned out to be.  Buckingham's \\"Monday Morning\\", starts out the disc with some fine So. Cal. rock.  Their cover of \\"Blue Letter\\", is just damn fine, Stevie's \\"Rhiannon\\" #11 gave them their first big hit in the States.  Christine's \\"Over My Head\\" #20, was the first single to crack them in the Top 40, still a beautiful song today.  Buckingham and Nicks brought their version of \\"Crystal\\" with them and it gets great treatment here.  \\"Say You Love Me\\" #11, \\"Landslide\\" are excellent songs.  Lindsey's \\"World Turning\\" and \\"I'm So Afraid\\",  gave this album that extra muscle.  Love Christine and Lindsey doing vocals together on \\"World Turning\\".  Christine's \\"Warm Ways\\" and \\"Sugar Daddy\\" are good pop songs.  In 1 1/2 years, they would release the 17 million seller \\"Rumours\\".

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|The concept is intriguing: A boy is able teleport anywhere in the world in just a second. However, the film is predictable and the action is quite boring. Towards the end, I realized that I didn't care about the characters or if the bad guys were going to catch and kill the jumpers. It doesn't help that the main character is cocky and obnoxious. In fact, I already forgot their names and have no interest in looking it up to make my review more complete.

B0013FBS20|3.0|I admit that I was tense and on the edge of my seat during this movie. I think it helps that I never read the novel or watched the movies that this story is based on. The computer effects of the Dark Seekers and the animals are not lifelike which annoys me. I liked the beginning when Robert is just trying to survive with his dog, Sam. Will Smith did a good job showing his desperation during his three-year isolation. All in all, the movie is predictable. The extras are subtitled.
B004U52VPS|4.0|I gave this game to my 11 year old brother as a B-Day gift. He really enjoys it as he's also in a big Lego phase now. The sling is a little weak and I'm hoping they sell additional pieces so you can expand and build more levels. It also would have been nice if the game could have made some noise for the $25 that was spent. Overall, good game, cool idea with plenty of room for expansion.
B00027JYLC|4.0|This movie has a butchered and censored feel to it; however, the story still remains intact. There are a lot of freaks: microcephalic people, a half-boy, a man without arms and legs (my favorite freak), dwarfs that look like children, Siamese twins, an intersex individual, a lady without arms, a human skeleton, a bearded lady, and a few others. It feels a bit wrong to stare at the bizarre and strange people but since they agreed to be filmed I don't feel too guilty. I like the moral of the story, which is that they are simply human beings and want to be treated that way. I really wanted to watch the documentary and was disappointed to find that the extras aren't closed captioned.

1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly by Cardiologist Dr. William Davis, M.D., offers considerable insight into the potential for wheat based products to be a significant cause of both obesity and the early onset of Type 2 diabetes. Davis gives us a provocative look at how eliminating wheat from our diet can not only help us lose weight, but shrink unsightly bulges, and reverse a broad spectrum of health problems, including Type 2 diabetes.  Dr. Davis points out that two slices of whole wheat bread can increase blood sugar more than 2 tablespoons of pure cane sugar. The consequences of wheat consumption, Dr. Davis points out, are not just manifested on the body's surface, but can also reach deep down into virtually every organ of the body, from the intestines, liver, heart, the thyroid gland and even the brain.<br /><br />Dr. Davis explains that there has been a national trend to reduce fat and cholesterol intake and increase carbohydrate calories, creating a \\"peculiar\\" situation in which products made from wheat  have not just increased their presence in our diets, but have come to dominate our diets.  Davis points out that today we are told to eat more healthy whole grains.<br /><br />In wheat free experiments conducted by Dr. Davis and his staff over a 3 month period, blood glucose levels in diabetic patients had dropped from a diabetic range of 136 mg/dl or greater to a normal range. Diabetics were transitioned into non-diabetics during the course of the experiment.  According to Davis, diabetes, in many cases, can be cured-not simply managed- by the removal of carbohydrates, especially wheat.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Dr. William Davis goes on to explain that wheat, more than any other foodstuff, has been woven into the fabric of the \\"American food experience\\".  Davis points out that wheat as a crop, has succeeded on an unprecedented scale, exceeded only by corn in acreage of farmland planted.<br /><br />Dr. Davis points out that modern genetically modified wheat does not even closely resemble the wheat of our ancestors. The einkorn based wheat of our ancestors.  Davis even conducted experiments by baking bread utilizing einkorn in one loaf and modern whole wheat in another loaf.  He concluded that after consumption of each product, blood sugar was only slightly elevated by consuming in einkorn based wheat, while blood sugar was great elevated (70 points or more through the consumption of modern whole wheat.<br /><br />In the final chapter of the book, Dr. Davis offers a number of wheat free menus as a means of getting started on the transition to a wheat free life. He also lists a number of foods that Americans consume on a daily basis that contain whole wheat, although it may not be evident. This list include beverages,  breakfast cereals, cheese products, energy, protein, and meal replacement bars.<br /><br />The Appendix contains a plethora of wheat free recipes, ranging from appetizers to main courses, to desserts.<br /><br />Wheat Belly, by Dr. William Davis, M.D. can be considered a well researched and authoritative source of information on wheat related diseases and health issues.  Dr. Davis includes a list of over 15 pages of references, indexed by chapter.  Davis does a commendable job of correlating the historical evolution of our wheat supply and a corresponding increase in wheat consumption with ever increasing incidences of diabetes, obesity, and a host of other health related issues.<br /><br />The book Wheat Belly should be considered a must read for all physicians, Type 2 diabetics, the obese, and those experiencing undiagnosed  health related issues.

B005UT29Z0|5.0|This is the type of movie I've grown to love more as I get older (I'm in my mid 30s). I'd rather have a scene with something fascinating unfolding in a company's boardroom followed by a private backroom conversation between characters as imposing as the ones Spacey and Irons can conjure, I'd rather have that than my screen being filled with explosions, CGI effects and cheesy one liners. This is the best film I've seen this year. Period. In this film you get to be a fly on the wall as one of the most age defining events of the decade (the financial meltdown) occur. I didn't take my eye off the screen for the whole duration of the film. I just couldn't. I watched captain America the other day and I simply didn't care about the characters or about anything that was happening on screen. I took phone calls, went to the kitchen for coffee, etc. (And it's not like I can't appreciate a good superhero movie, Thor was awesome, but Hollywood nowadays, is turning into a one liner fest with no substance). The only thing that this movie allowed me to do while it was playing, was to look at the screen and breathe in order to keep a steady body temperature. I didn't do anything else. It was THAT good. I know it's  a totally different type of film (compared to Captain America) but a good  movie is a good movie. Period.  I wish more movies like these were made.

1451648537|5.0|I am still on a high from reading this book last night. I spent the entire day reading it, I just didn't want to put it down. I read about 150 books a year, across all genres and from different time periods, and I can honestly say that this is the best book I have read all year. Just so incredibly interesting and fascinating.  I was a fair way through it when I thought that book should have been called: Apple - with Steve Jobs, but reading further that he wasn't the most attentive father, was a driven businessman and pioneer, there isn't really anything you can write about this man other than his CEO positions in Apple (and Pixar). This man WAS (IS) Apple; and the world is a better and more amazing place for him having been in it. I am so looking forward to reading this again.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Just finished watching it and both my wife and I thought it was pretty good and lots of fun. I grew up reading all the Marvel comics back in the early sixties (I still have a few score of them) and could relate and appreciate the effort put into this film.  While several changes were made to modernize Cap, some things were left as they were intended. Lots of action, nice character development (once again, with more films in mind), a great blend of evil characters - the Red Skull is one of the more fiendish baddies ever, right next to Dr Doom and the hordes of Hydra were nicely done as were the giant sets, massive aircraft etc...  Great production efforts, a good mix of WWII related action and Hydra-inspired weaponry and the right mix of explosions that didn't overwhelm the storyline.  As next year's Avengers epic is due summer of 2012 which could produce the biggest film series since 'Star Wars' if done correctly. The money is there, the fan base is there and the potential for some terrific action sequences is right around the corner.  As for Captain America, pretty enjoyable, my wife is from the Philippines and had never heard of Cap before enjoyed the efforts and asked me all sorts of questions about him. It was also great seeing the quick cameo of the great Stan Lee in this one also.  Good for it. If you ever read the Marvel comics, do yourself a favor and rent or buy this one, not too shabby and lots of fun to watch.

B004WE01YA|5.0|I'm not much of a family cartoon kind of guy, I like horror movies. But I got a 3DTV and kind of wanted to have more 3D movies to watch and use when I have people come over. And for those that don't know what its like to have a 3D movie or TV, it really is good. I dropped allot of money for one so its really better than the movie theaters.<br />Anyways, I question how they would do a 3D cartoon that isn't like the movies cars. So, I thought I buy this as well as The Lion King 3D. And I was speechless, it was amazing to watch.<br />I love how if I have to baby sit, I can toss this in the blu ray and have hours to myself cuz they love the 3D.<br />However, I will say I am a total sucker for Aladdin, when they make that in 3D I will have that day its out.

1423140591|4.0|Yet another fun read from RR.<br /><br />In book two of the Heroes of Olympus: The Son of Neptune, we are reunited with Percy Jackson, and introduced to two new friends of his, Hazel and Frank, as well as some familiar characters likeNico, who has grown up somewhat, Tyson, Reyna, and Hylla; all minor characters in the previous Percy Jackson series.<br /><br />The adventure continues where the first book left off and we learn what happened to Percy when he disappeared, as mentioned in the first book. We also get better acquainted with his new friends: Hazel and Frank, and learn more about the prophecy of seven, as well as their role in the prophecy-- both are fascinating. We are also introduced to some new gods (Iris and Terminus), new villains (Medusa's sisters' were my favorite), and come across some that were met in the first book. Frank was a very interesting character and I would love to get to know him better.<br /><br />The book was a great read and quick because I didn't want to put it down. As usual we got to learn something new- in this case the focus was on Roman life- very interesting; and we got a chance to explore the roman camp for demigods--I see some interesting possibilities.<br /><br />While RR seems to follow the same plot- get quest, deal with obstacles and complete quest with time complications, while traveling through the USA, I still have a fun time reading his books. He has a nice writing style, and I enjoy reading his quirky juxtapositions of myth and reality. Can't wait for the next book in the series.
0307476154|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK.  EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST!! i COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN FROM THE MINUTE I STARTED.  THE 3RD IN THE SERIES WAS EVEN BETTER!
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was left a little flat.  I realized it is because I came to the movie with my own preconceived notions of what I wanted the movie to give me.  I saw it again a few times when it was on HBO.  Every time I viewed it, I was able to see the layers within the storyline.  I definitely love this movie and will order it on DVD.  Interwoven among the concept of the afterlife, is the story of three unrelated people from 3 different countries (USA, France & England).  It is \\"death\\" for them that changes their lives and makes them rethink their concept of what it means to be alive and that nothing or no one is permanent - and we need not fear that, but celebrate the times we had with someone - no matter how brief or long as a gift - instead of the pain after the loss - it also speaks of forgiveness and the evolution of the spirit, who realizes mistakes made during a lifetime even after death.  It also draws upon the concept that we are all connected and that death is not the end, but the beginning of something else - the movie does not answer what this beginning is, because it leaves that up to the viewer based on their own belief systems. It just seeks to portray spirit life as a cycle even after death - whether that means heaven to someone or whether it means the spirit learning and coming back for more lessons and connections.  In the storyline, we have the psychic (Matt Damon), who has a gift that is really a curse for him, because he cannot have normal relationships, as everyone sees him as a freak and/or only needs him in order to communicate with those that have passed.  He is the \\"real\\" deal as far as psychics go - he developed this \\"gift\\" after a bout of illness and surgery as a child.  All he wants is a connection to being alive - a normal life - and to have a relationship with someone who understands him as a human being and that what he knows is not a freakish gift, but is a lesson that others who have experienced near death experiences already know - a universal consciousness of the continuity of the spirit.  We have the french television journalist, who experiences a death experience during a tsunami, and changes because of what she experienced.  She has to seek another path, as she becomes ostracized as a journalist for trying to discuss and write a book about her experience after researching documented data.  We have a twin boy from England, who loses his sibling and his rock as the children of a mother who loves them both, but has addiction problems.  The story is about the eventual interaction between all of these characters.  It not only involves issues regarding death, but our connection to everyone because of death and because of life.  It is also a love story and the concept of how although we think we are alone, we never are - not only with those who passed, but those who live among us.

B0033AX26I|5.0|My wife (who is Hondurana) and I enjoyed this album.  This particular album rises to the level of the Cheiftain's CD recording of Celtic wedding music, mostly from Celtic Brittany.  The San Patricios were mostly newly arrived Irish immigrants who had been recruited for the U.S. military almost as soon as they got off the ships; they were escaping from famine stricken Ireland (thanks to the Anglo-Irish landowners).  Approximately 1/3 of the Irish population disappeared because of the famine. (The still existing good potatoes were sent off to England to be sold and for the landowners, speculators and traders to profit from.)  At this time in U.S. history, the newly arrived immigrants from Ireland were heavily discriminated against by the WASP population.  In other words, the same type of Anglo power structure directed both cultural and material negative feedback toward these new arrivals.  Is it any wonder many of them felt they had more in common with the Mexican soldados than they felt they had with their WASP commanders and WASP fellow soldiers.  They had escaped the Anglo-Irish oppression in their own nation to only face it again in the U.S.    When the San Patracios enlisted on the side of the Mexicans (who were fighting to protect and keep a large part of their nation - Alta Mexico), these men received nothing but positive cultural and material feedback.  In fact, to this day, the San Patricios have monuments built to their memory throughout Mexico. To the Mexicans, they are heroes.  They attempted to stop the ruthless aggression of the hypocritical Anglos who were invading a nation in order to either steal its land or its resources...as we see in Iraq or Lybia, today.  Earlier, in Ireland, the same WASPs had stole the lands of the Celtic Irish and made them minorities within their own nation.  If you are against the rampaging greed and bloodlust of those same private powers that rule the US today, the San Patricios should be your heroes, also.   The music is not only an acknowledgement of these heroes of anti-imperialism.  It is also a very creative, thoughtful, and authentic attempt to both blend Irish and Mexican folk cultures and to focus on song lyrics relating to Anglo imperialism, social regression and arrogance.  Almost all professional music reviewers highly rated this particular CD ...and they usually only discussed the music and the CD's aesthetic concept.  None of the music overstays its welcome.  Each cut of the CD is as long as it needs to be.  None of it is either commercial or political filler. It is an authentic attempt to capture what the music of the San Patricios may have sounded like when they fought and danced with their fellow Mexicans.  It also connects to the anti-imperialist spirit of both groups.  ...great, memorable, inspiring and highly recommended.
B005H0IW6W|3.0|I have been a fan since before Michael's debut in 2003.  I loved the first cd and still play it over and over.  Each one since that date has deteriorated.  I went to three concerts - the first two were great, the third - not so much.  I stopped going.  This cd is an improvement over the last.  Most of the songs are good, just two or three I could do without.  What I find really disappointing in the last three cd's is the phrasing, enunciation and slurring together of some words.  I would like Michael to get back to basics and use David Foster as the great producer that he is. Also, stop writing songs - the great American Songbook is there for your use and you can't do any better than that!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|As with his other books, Isaacson has produced a great biography. But it's more than just a bio of Jobs - it's a fascinating story about the ascent of the high tech industry. I really enjoyed the background details about how deals get done (or not) in Silicon Valley. I also liked reading about the different approaches for marketing high tech products.  In an op-ed piece in the NY Times, Joe Nocera criticized this book. It's too soon to fully assess Jobs's impact, Nocera wrote, and Isaacson grew too close to Jobs while interviewing him for this book to be objective.  I think Nocera was quibbling. One can simply read down the list of products Jobs developed and the market success they achieved to judge his impact. And Isaacson pulled no punches in describing Jobs's personality. I thought Isaacson's assessment at the end of his book was thoughtful and well-considered, and I'd recommend this book highly.  Besides, it's just fun to read about all this techie stuff going back to the very first personal computers.
1594744475|4.0|I really enjoyed this cookbook! I found it to be very helpful, descriptive, and informative about ingredients and ideas of what you can fill within your bento boxes.  Everything is simple and clearly labeled. There are plenty of pictures along with the directions, which is very helpful considering I'm a visual learner. The only reason I would give this 4 stars is because some of the ingredients such as nori, are going to be hard to find.  I happen to have it lucky and live right next to an asian market! :P<br /><br />But I think some of the recipes can be changed around to whatever you want. For example, a fish ball can be a meatball instead.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cookbook!<br />Have fun!

B005IZLPMY|3.0|I'll admit Captain America had an interesting premise but the delivery was pretty average.  There were a lot of explosions and fight scenes and not enough back story or even tension within the characters.  Schmidt wanted world domination.  That's it.  He was too simple.  Rogers was too straight up of a good guy to have much depth.  And agent Peggy Clark was not very interesting either.  To put it straight:  I became more interested in my Cheddar flavored popcorn than the movie.  It could have been much better. --Sherry Gripman, Author
0143119788|5.0|Every scene in this book is as well-plotted as any thriller every published.  Some of my favorites include the one when Smiley enters his home and realizes the mail has shifted from the floor, when Smiley holds a conversation with the madame about a source's past, or when Smiley's ally sneaks into the file room to find potentially valuable information.<br /><br />When I finished reading this, I wondered if one would betray his or her country anymore in the Western world for political ideology in the way one character in this work does.  I guess I could see it for radical Islam or Judaism (religion), but I'm not sure the same capacity is there following the end of the Cold War and the defeat of communism.  Maybe times will change again, but it might be while before we see the kind of moral ambiguity about country actualized that Le Carre creates here.

B004LZFWJO|2.0|I got this as the free app of the day, so I'm more than glad to do an honest review. It installed fine on my EVO 3D and it plays ok. The biggest problem right off the bat is that it doesn't fit my screen fully. Ok, not exactly a deal breaker in this situation, but had I purchased it for $3 it would be. I see people complaining about not swiping patterns correctly. I would disagree. It's was very responsive. The music, eh. It could be better. My biggest complaint is that it's way too easy for me or probably any adult. Seriously, you can score points by connecting 2 pieces in a row. How hard is that? They're all over the game board. But I can see how kids might love this.   Final thought. This is not for me. I've already uninstalled it. It's not the worst game I've tried, but far from great or worth the money. That's why I give it 2 stars. Had I paid $3 for it, I'd be really pissed. Those who let their kids play on their handheld devices might find value in this.
1451648537|5.0|I'm giving this book 5 stars because it is very well written, I enjoyed it thoroughly and I learned many lessons from listening to it (Audible version).  For decades I was a Steve Jobs admirer and enthusiast.  First admiring his entrepreneurial boldness and success.  Then the many wonderful creations he brought to market.  Our home has many Apple products and Pixar films in it, and I remain deeply impressed by Jobs' ability to create the vision for brilliant products but more importantly his ability to turn them into reality and successfully commercialize them.   However...  Over the years I would hear occasional comments about Jobs being 'mercurial' and prone to emotional outburst and temper tantrums, and would make me wonder what kind of a man Steve Jobs really was behind closed doors.  Walter Issacson's biography reveals that Steve Jobs was very often an incredibly cruel human being.  If he didn't agree with a dissenting opinion, rather than have an open, mature debate he would lash out and cut the other person down, saying something along the lines of, 'That's the f*****g stupidest idea I've ever heard.'  He would embarrass and shame people, often Apple employees working long hours to try and bring his ideas to reality.    Anyone who has worked for corporate America for a while has likely come in contact with, or knows someone who has, a really bad boss.  Steve Jobs was the epitome of a bad boss.  He was a brutal, mean and nasty BULLY.  It appears the best thing he would ever say about an person's idea was, 'Well, it's a start', implying it's not good enough.  If he did like someone's idea, he would not say so, but then suggest it as his own idea a week later.  Steve Jobs openly admitted to getting the ideas for the graphical user interface and the mouse from a trip to Xerox Parc, and took these ideas and made them his own.  Yet he harshly criticized Bill Gates for 'stealing' his idea and turning it into Windows.  What a study in contrasts.  A man to be admiredfor his brilliant creative vision combined with the ability to execute and successfully commercialize his inventions.  And at the same time, a narcissistic bully who lacked basic human kindness and decency.

B005CHWXHE|1.0|I think after ten years Martin could and should have moved the plot along. After 5 years I couldn't remember some of the story details prior to book 4 and then memory faded after another 5 years getting to Dance with Dragons. So I listened to audio versions of books 1-3 as a refresher prior to book 4 and then again prior to to the release of Dragons plus reviewed book 4. I had high hopes for this book but about half-way through I realized the book wasn't going to go anywhere, so I skimmed to the end to see if I was right and sure enough it didn't. I couldn't believe it. This is all we get after 10 years? I'm glad I didn't waste any more time on this book. I mean there's a little plot development, but if it was a chess game, none of the major pieces really changed position or took a significant position. I'm pretty much done with the series at this point. Maybe ten years from now I may remember \\"hey I wonder what ever happened with Ice and Fire\\" and check reviews or buy a used book, but I won't be anxiously waiting for or purchasing the next installment. I've been fooled twice now with book 4 and 5 so shame on Martin. The first 3 books are very good. Book 4 and 5 really should have been compressed into the first half of what book four should have been. There's an incredible amount of detail that slows the book down and doesn't add much to the plot. I bought the Kindle version which was a high quality electronic version of the book and very good as far as the delivery format.
0385535139|1.0|I guess Mr. Grisham felt compelled to stick to his \\"book a year\\" formula.  If you are entertained by the ever-shallow James Patterson book mill, be sure to pick up a copy of The Litigators.  As a constant reader of Mr. Grisham, I never believed he would throw together a novel with a storyline that would never happen. The pace is particuarly slow, the characters are unbelievable, the scenarios laid out are nonsensical.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|How does anyone compile the complexity of steve jobs--his personality, business acumen, spirituality-- into a single book? I do not believe it entirely possible, especially after reading through the 600 pages of this newest work about SJobs.  With few exceptions, this book imparts no new information---most of the content can be retrieved from old magazine articles, previously written books, and tons of Internet search results.  I also believe this book is not yet complete: it needs a serious edit to trim redundancies and to further balance out the hugely negative portrait with more enlightening information about this giant of a person. I often wondered if final edits were sacrificed to meet the accelerated publishing date. Perhaps a revised version will come through later, which I would advise people to wait for if they've not yet purchased the book.<br /><br />Nearly everyone (at least in Silicon Valley) knows that Jobs was eccentric, scary, tyrannical, histrionic, and abusive at times. So I was glad to read about some tender moments with his  father, sister Mona, his wife and children, his friendship with Ellison, and the times when he rewarded his engineering teams in his own special ways. I also really enjoyed the little stories about his friendship with Wozniak, and their pranks. I did not appreciate (and found it disruptive) to read far too many reminders that Jobs cried, screamed, and dissed just about anyone in sight. That message has come across from many other writers just as poignantly---in far more respectful ways. In fact, (other) better documentation about Jobs focuses more on his intelligence, vision, and marketing mastery rather than the (immature) emotion.  To regard Jobs as a rotten human being (which would be easy to do as  result of this reading) does not do him justice. His form of philanthropy did not follow the usual protocol of people from his level; his form of love and generosity differed from what we usually view as normal. He did, indeed, run on a different OS than most of us.<br />Two quotes do stand out, for me, from this book, which did help me tap into a bit more of the 'mind' of steve jobs:<br />- S.Jobs lashes out with \\" you have no idea how I feel...no idea what it's like to be me.\\" (said at around 30 yrs old), in conjunction with:<br />- his wife's analysis of her husband (near the time of his death  \\" Like many great men whose gifts are extraordinary, he's not extraordinary in every realm. He doesn't have social graces...but he cares deeply about empowering humankind, the advancement of humankind and putting the right tools in their hands.\\"<br />I can therefore only guess at the tortured, fertile mind of this man as he persistently tried to fulfill such a tall order, and the frustrations that most likely ensued from trying to get other people to rise to their best efforts in order to achieve this mission.<br />I VERY much liked the chapter (29) devoted to Apple Stores.  Even tho I'm not a Mac-head,  I view the dedicated high-tech store as one of his crowning achievements: each is a work of art while serving as the museum in which to view Apple's works of art (otherwise known as products). These stores not only epitomize and perpetuate his design philosphies but they are yet another example of his amazing head for business.<br /><br />I am shocked that Jobs did not review this book (I believe he did not because he asks Issacson if he wouldn't like some of it...), and I think he'd deem it inferior if he'd been healthy enough to plow thru the page mass. In a quality assessment, it just doesn't measure up.different OS than most of us.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I think this is one of Kelly Clarkson \\"Stronger\\" album in a long long time. Her previous album is good but some of the songs in the previous album can be a little bit inconsistent in my opinion. I think that her \\"Breakaway\\" album is the best so far and with \\"My December\\" that album is kind of based on rockish \\"Since U Been Gone\\" and \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\\" - it is a great album despite the controversy with the recording studio but I do admit that something is missing. \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" was super smart and sassy with some really awesome dance pieces even though some of the dance tunes might sound a bit too generic sometimes - but hey it is catchy enough to keep me entertained and keep on listening to it.<br /><br />Now this new album is absolutely FANTASTIC. Original. New Kelly. My first run of the entire album left me impressed - it started with \\"Mr Know It All\\" which is really catchy and cool - and then it progress with one of my most favorite track in this album \\"Stronger\\". My first impression to my first listening was that I really REALLY like almost all of her song in this album! And it gets better with each time I listened to it. This album have awesome mix of dance, rock, pop, I dunno - some mixtures of some really interesting sound along with some really honest expression about herself. I like that this album shows her positive side, I also love that she showed her vulnerability via some of the tracks in this album. Kelly has always been herself and she is the kind of person who never let people dictate who she is - and it clearly shows in all her work. And I think this particular album have the right mix of her music expression to the liking of mass market.<br /><br />I cannot wait to see her in concert. I had her catchy tunes playing in my head for days now. She really rocks!

B0051OZ564|4.0|I just rented this on VOD and I can honestly say I am presently surprised (yes that is a play on words).  The movie is not for those that are looking for a realistic movie, but it touches on some real emotions and feelings (like attractive women and the need to watch crap get shot, sliced and blown to pieces by them).  Here are the pro's and con's and hopefully it will help you decide for yourself.  Pro's  1) Imaginative with lots of fun twists  2) LOTR grade battle scenes (specifically the CGI and point that in those movies a mere humans can take down a 50 ft tall elephant) with intense action (I'll touch on this in con's too)  3) Hot Girls fighting in skimpy clothing  4) Very interesting comic based plot  5) It's unreal so you can enjoy that it is going to have unbelievable fight scenes with crazy CGI and awesome explosions (yeah, it isn't based on a work of non-fiction... shocker that this is not really a biography)  Con's  1) Fight scenes are semi-repetitive, but unique enough to be intense  2  Not going to spoil it by going into details) Ending is kind of trippy and you have to really think about what is going on (some people don't like to think)  3) Hot Girls fighting in skimpy clothing (some of you may not be into that or think that it is a cheap trick to get you interested)  My expectation is that if you like 300, final fantasy, Babylon AD, Sin City, Chronicles of Riddick (all or one), LOTR (fight scenes), you probably will like this movie... then again what do I know.  For those that hated this movie, you are certainly entitled to your opinion and I am sure people appreciate it... Take comfort in knowing that there is an amazing possibility that this movie will never have a sequel (this is coming from a fan).
B001RTP3YQ|3.0|I've been a long time admirer of Leonard Cohen. But for all the devout, gushing 5 star reviews of this thing, something really needs to be said. In terms of production & instrumentation: Leonard Cohen retired to Florida years ago.<br /><br />Ever since I'm Your Man it's been great songs, trivialized by unbearably cheesy production. Synths, backing singers, drum machines, at best it sounded like AM Smooth Jazz. At worst, Barry White backed by Flock of Seagulls meets Kajagoogoo.<br /><br />The sound here however, is more like Leonard Cohen backed by Kenny G. and Yanni.<br /><br />That said, the album's most genuinely funny moment comes when Cohen flips on the Casio & dryly quips, \\"this thing...it works...all by itself\\".<br /><br />Listening to this, makes me wish Rick Rubin would do for Cohen what the American Recordings did for Johnny Cash. The man truly writes great songs. They've always worked best in a stark, non-processed setting.<br /><br />Someone, please...Stage an intervention...

B0000VCZKW|5.0|I read Matilda as a young child and loved the title character, being a bookworm myself. I now have a first grader who loves books and reading, and she just finished the book by Roald Dahl, so we decided to check the movie out. We watched it together tonight and though I preferred the book, my first grader loved the movie. It is quite a good adaptation, though there are some wince-inducing scenes, especially those involving the cruel and sadistic principal of Matilda's school.<br /><br />The story centers on Matilda (played to perfection by the charming Mara Wilson). Matilda is a misfit in her own family. Her parents and older brother are insensitive, self-absorbed individuals who prefer watching idiotic shows on television rather than improving their brains with books. They treat Matilda with contempt and derision, but Matilda takes it in her stride, choosing to broaden her mind with books, walking ten blocks to the library, and being a pleasant, polite little girl. Her great ally is her gentle teacher Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz) who sees Matilda's potential and identifies her as a kindred spirit.<br /><br />The movie does contain some very disturbing sequences which might terrify younger children. Having read the book and watching the movie with my daughter helped her understand some of the abusive language used against Matilda. Her father frequently calls her \\"dumb\\" and even a \\"twit\\". The principal, Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris) likens her to a \\"villainous sack of gobslime\\". There are also violent scenes such as the principal forcing a young boy to gorge on a huge chocolate cake, and many more.<br /><br />Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman portray Matilda's selfish, irresponsible parents to the hilt. Mara Wilson credibly and charmingly plays the brilliant child who learns to not only overcome adversity, but remains humbled by her intelligence, and helps others stand up for what is right. Matilda is a positive role model for children everywhere, and the story inspires a love of knowledge and helps children understand how good ultimately triumphs over evil.ildren understand how good ultimately triumphs over evil.

B0053Y9AXQ|3.0|No record company has released a definitive Sam Cooke anthology. There is a fine 3 cd box set 'The Man Who Invented Soul' which covers the hits plus a long unreleased late live recording at the Harlem Square club. There are also some cds covering various parts of his career, including the ABKO one which covers the final stages. This set represents what the record company wanted Sam to do. They intended to move him into the middle class, supper club / Las Vegas area. Despite this he manages to take an original approach to many of the songs. The sound is OK, the documentation is as bad as i've seen (none). However, this is a reasonably priced set for those who appreciate Sam Cooke. When will an 8 or 10 cd set come out that treats this great singer with the respect he deserves.

I love the news featurettes, and you get all the old features from the previous DVDs. Overall, it's a great package.
B0002HZ18C|5.0|I  have modeled this kit several times, and have found it to be a very Detailed  and accurate kit of a Harbor tug.  The Long beach  a Tug in California is one of these tugs  and the model matches very well to her.  The only short falls in the this kit. are the crew could use to be reworked.  the figures are nicely detailed  but are a little out of scale. and a tug  usually has more than three hands on them.  The life boat  is a nice detailed part  but most tugs in the late 40's  had a double ended boat.  not a boat with a square stern.  by  the 60's most of these boats were removed to make deck space and only a co2 life raft  was carried.   In fact  working with photos, you can actually model this tug as it was built as per the kit.  or add and remove parts to show these tugs at different stages of their careers. on my last model of this tug I removed the after mast, life boat, davits. added a flag staff and modeled her with Moran tug colors on her.   Unlike one reviewer claimed.  the model is NOT deceiving, and is fact worth every nickle. It is an excellent kit of a harbor tug.  and a great addition to any maritime collection.  I  in fact  intend to build another of this kit.

0679411585|5.0|Hal Moore's and Joseph Galloway's \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\" is a rare feat for a work of non-fiction: through phenomenal writing it brings the events of the November 1965 Ia Drang battle to life vividly and harshly. The writing and pacing of \\"We Were Soldiers\\" take the reader as  close as possible to the battlefield through Hal Moore's exhaustive interviews with hundreds of veterans of the brutal opening fight between US forces and North Vietnamese regulars, deep research and his own experience having commanded the American forces there. From the first page the reader will be drawn in and it will be hard to put this book down, as clichéd as that may sound.  Moore and Galloway's \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is especially memorable in that--(for this reviewer it was the first time)--not only was the viewpoint of the enemy expressed, but that the authors interviewed the actual North Vietnamese commander they had faced at Landing Zone X-Ray. The insight provided by then-LTC An on how he met and battled his American adversaries helps to paint a fuller portrait of the fighting.  Finally, the authors took a rare step to examine the after effects of the battle, and the \\"after after-effects.\\" Moore and Galloway illustrate the true and rarely examined cost of war by interviewing the children of some of the men killed in the battle. The deep and devastating impact the loss of a father could have on the upbringing of a baby girl or a toddler at the time of the battle serve as a stark denouement to the story.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Ok, Darth Vader saying NOOOOO SUCKS, other than that i like the changes, and the sound/video is really nice, definitely a really cool blu-ray set
B000JIHP88|5.0|I ordered two of these after my twin sons showed interest in the fisher price rainforest bouncer. That is a great item too, by the way!! The mobile is AWESOME! We love it, great sounds, many options (just movement, movement w/light, movement w/music, etc.) and the remote is handy if your baby wakes up and you want to soothe him back to sleep without him seeing you and fully waking. I would definitely recommend!!

B0028O34SG|5.0|The blu-ray version of Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro is quite amazing.  The picture  is superb, the sound quality excellent, the acting authentic and the vocals beautiful.  If you want a dvd of this Mozart masterpiece, this is the best one.  A true joy.
0312370830|2.0|This book is 25 percent historical fiction, 75 percent blabbering about a married woman's mid life miseries.  Had the author developed and continued the theme of France's role in the Holocaust, it would have been a compelling read.  Unfortunately, the important part of the story was over when it just should have started, leaving the remainder a dull, beach novel which anyone can write.  I feel the author did the easy research, barely, and then couldn't be bothered to finish it.  She took the easy way out.  This is by no means an historical novel.  It shot to fame due to Oprah.  There are much better books describing France's complicity with Nazi Germany.

1451648537|4.0|This 600-page tome has something for everyone. If you like biography, you'll appreciate Walter Isaacson's skillful weaving of the threads he gathered from hundreds of first-person interviews and other primary resources. If you like innovation and technology, you'll welcome the inside stories on many of the products we use every day and which will no doubt influence spinoffs for decades to come. If you like business, you'll enjoy the behind-the-scenes looks at Apple Computer, Xerox, Microsoft, Pixar, and even PepsiCo. If you like psychology, you'll be enthralled by the bundle of contradictions who was Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Being a student of leadership and human performance, I found myself mostly wondering what might have been. Steve Jobs said he loved and appreciated the parents who adopted him as a baby. Yet by his own admission he often treated his parents with disdain, manipulation, and even bullying. Jobs said he admired people who contributed to the innovation and technology that were the driving forces in his life. Yet he was insufferably unkind and ungrateful to many of them, even to the point of denying them both the credit and the rewards they clearly deserved. In his own words, Jobs said he was gifted. Yet he claimed not to believe in God. This leaves one to wonder what - or Whom - he regarded as the source of his gifts.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Steve Jobs was a genius. He was visionary. His contributions to the way we communicate and conduct business will be felt for generations. But let's not get carried away with the hero worship we see in some of the commentary about his life and recent death. While not detracting from his obvious strengths, let's ponder how much more effective he could have been had he chosen to collaborate with others more generously and humbly. Much has been said about Jobs' famous reality distortion field in which he seemed oblivious to the limits of his own paradigms and the consequences of his own behaviors. It is possible (and advisable) to be tough on ideas and issues while being civil and humane with people. Let's not fall into the trap of assuming that brutality is a necessary companion to brilliance. It's not.o be tough on ideas and issues while being civil and humane with people. Let's not fall into the trap of assuming that brutality is a necessary companion to brilliance. It's not.
0307279189|4.0|The only reason that I didnt give this book 5 stars is due to the fact that the author went off subject a little to much.
0061020680|5.0|Any library should keep a whole section for this author.   Mort is another work of art from Terry Pratchett, keeping the reader's face etched in a half-smile, shaking his head in disbelief now and then.  Death, probably one of the favorite characters in his whole universe, keep on surprising us with his attempt at humanity. He might be the very personification of the end of a life, but since it's out of the collective minds of humans, there are always some kirks that stand out. This books explain very well events that were hinted in previous books, making this a piece of collection for any fans, and a good explanatory course for anyone discovering this marvelous universe. Welcome to a world where the strange is common and the routine ever-changing!
B003AYMZO2|5.0|My husband and I found out about this series about 3 weeks ago. We immediately started watching, thanks to Netflix, and were so addicted to the show. The acting is fantastic, and the story lines are great! We have finished the first 3 seasons and can't wait to start #4.
B001AQMBHI|3.0|FINAL DESTINATION is a well done thriller and a superb beginning to a never ending series.  This film is known for the infamous plane disaster and established a killer that it is very hard to stop - death itself.  And the death scenes here are very inventive.  You will be jumping out of your skin.  This film has suspense and thrills to the perfect combination with some pretty good acting.<br /><br />So why the 3 stars?  This is a review of the blu ray and this is honestly a terrible blu ray transfer.  It adds nothing to the quality of the dvd and the viewing experience looses much of its impact due to its poor quality.  The 1080p video is very dark, colors have no vibrancy and there is no detail or clarity that one would expect from a blu ray.  There is graininess which is expected for a film of this age but this added with the lackluster presentation makes for a subpar viewing experince.  The audio also lacks.  It is a little better than the video but nothing to praise.  Right from the first shot you know the video is off and the plane explosion looses all impact due to the poor video transfer and audio.  I was so let down.<br /><br />Sadly, if you purchase this as I did hoping to watch all your favorite scenes in the vividness of blu ray you will be very disappointed.  I have never seen a blu ray transfer where the video was so dark and lacking in clarity compared to the original.  FINAL DESTINATION 2 and 3 look great on blu ray so I would stick with the dvd on this one and advance to blu ray for the future ones in the series.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Okay, so the first half hour was so predictable. And then, it wasn't predictable. And then it was, and then it wasn't! You know what! I enjoyed this movie. For a Kung Fu movie, really, really masterfully done. I had a good time watching it.
1451648537|5.0|My husband is a huge fan of apple products and idolized Steve Jobs. He has the hardback and digital copy and seems to love it. The book also has some great pictures.
0805047905|5.0|I have read this book to my 15 month old son so many times and it never gets old for either one of us.  The pictures are bright w out being too cartoony.  It is great for learning animals, colors and repetition.
1439153663|4.0|Initially confusing since chapters alternate which character is narrating but once you get passed that it's an amazing story that makes you feel every emotion the characters are faced with. Many chapters with death and new life and the ending is very bittersweet. I'm actually sad to be done. Great book!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The mighty Thor and his hammer is virtually indestructible! Great story and overall cast. Awesome special effects. Can't wait to see Thor when he joins up with Th Avengers!
B005DKLPQ0|3.0|This set is misleading because it is not a complete overview of the band. It is complete in that all of the albums are present, but not all of the songs. It would be understandable if all obscure different versions are not present - for instance, we don't need 11 live versions of Shelia Take a Bow. However, some studio recordings that were officially released are missing. If you buy this, then download the extras on the side from other sources.
B000000OQF|5.0|Although Guns N' Roses are overrated in the annals of rock history, Appetite for Destruction is one of the great party albums and one of the best hard rock discs of the 1980's.  Let's start with the hit singles. \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" still sounds awesome all these years later. The riff was a killer and the lyric stuck in your head immediately. If you grew up in this era as I did, you can still rattle off the words to this one. \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" may have been the best power ballad of the era and featured a great singalong guitar line from Slash and another great lyric and hook (\\"Where do we go? Where do we go now? Where do we go?\\"). \\"Paradise City\\" was another huge hit and has a great jam at the end. All three of these still get played daily on classic rock stations. But there is a ton of other great songs here including the should have been the fourth hit \\"Nightrain\\", the catchy as sin \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", the melodic \\"Think About You\\", the wicked \\"You're Crazy\\", and the anthem \\"Out Ta Get Me\\". The remaining tracks (\\"My Michelle\\", \\"Anything Goes\\", and \\"Rocket Queen\\") are also very good. After this, the band would release a very good EP in G N' R Lies (half of which had been released two years earlier) and then they'd never be the same as they would slowly crumble under lead singer Axl Rose's massive ego and those bloated and inconsistent Use Your Illusion albums. But they'll always have Appetite for Destruction: a classic album that all fans of rock n' roll should have.
159562015X|5.0|Aside from the obvious value to professionals in the workplace, married couples could learn a great deal about each other from this survey. (Of course, they'd each have to be open to LEARNING about each other instead of being focused on CHANGING each other!) No risk here... this is a bargain!
B000EQ47HC|4.0|Boston avoided the dreaded sophomore slump on Don't Look Back. Although not a classic like their self-titled debut, there's a lot to love on Don't Look Back and there is no filler to be found. The title track is magic. The drama and guitar hook along with vocalist Brad Delp's soaring performance make this is a classic that you still hear everyday on classic rock stations. \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" is a melancholy ballad that was also a chart single and this is strong as well. You still hear the hard rocking \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\" on occasion and this is another great tune. The remaining songs are all good even if they don't have the electricity of the album tracks of the debut as \\"Party\\", \\"It's Easy\\", and \\"Don't Be Afraid\\" elicit a strong vibe with their catchy choruses and multi-tracked guitars while \\"Used to Bad News\\" is more somber both lyrically and musically and Tom Scholz has a great melodic guitar solo on this one. All told, Don't Look Back is a very good album and if you love the debut, you'll at least like this one a lot.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|This album is a definite must own! The music has good catchy riffs throughout and I also really connected with the songwriting. One of the best workout albums I have listened too, really cranks up the intensity!

B0053YGYO4|5.0|This album is one of the band's best, and it is definitely different, but it is fantastic nonetheless. I honestly don't see why people hate this wonderfully put together piece of art.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Damn it all, this actually does sound worse after taking their post-\\"Bright Lights\\" career into account.  So, Interpol: Take the philosophy and the production of early-aughts New York (that's Manhattan, not Brooklyn, which makes them either more or less pretentious depending on your perspective), add some deliberately facile lyrics, and coat every song in unvarnished sex.  It's straightforward, and brooding, and at times it's really impressive. I still wish I liked it half as much as I used to.
0446585025|5.0|Awesome book!  I wouldn't expect anything less of Ellen!!!! Her humor is never just left for the stage.  She is even funny through words in a book!!!!
B004XE0P5E|3.0|There's some brilliant, beautiful (if a little overcooked) songwriting on this album, but you can't really tell, because Justin Vernon is getting more and more mumbly with age. The production, for that matter, is almost nothing like our beloved \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\" -- it sounds more like Lionel Ritchie on Saddle Creek. It turns out that this guy is talented and outgoing enough to be a real rock star; in the meantime, he won't begrudge you preferring his lonely-guy-in-the-woods phase.
0061120073|5.0|This was the book that set me on the path to a life-long love of reading. I read this book in the sixth grade because my mom had been trying to get me interested in reading, but up to that point, nothing had clicked with me. She said she was going to read it along with me and quiz me after each chapter. It wasn't long before I didn't want to put it down. From then on, I would read just about anything I could get my hands on. I have such a fondness for this touching story and I plan to read it with my sixth grade students as the time frame and subject matter correlate with my state's social studies standards.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a very humorous book about a young man around sixteen who loses his memory and is the son of Poseiden or Neptune.  Percy Jackson. He will get his memory back by proving worthy to Juno or Herea. Second book in the series. Book #1 is heroes of Olympus. Sutable for ages 9-13
B005GIS8VE|1.0|Horrible. My husband heard that this was a funny movie, and so we rented it one night. At the end I was sorry that I had wasted part of my life watching it. Makes fun of homosexuality almost constantly, makes a \\"funny joke\\" out of child sexual abuse, and has nothing redeeming, uplifting, or even funny about it. I know that some people like this kind of gross, bigoted, brutal humor, but I don't. My advice is don't waste two hours of your life on this movie.
B00003CY5J|2.0|Great cast (why I wanted to watch it) but I felt it was not scripted: Marlon,Robert and Edward (who was main reason I ordered the disc) seemed to be making it up as they went along. Loved Montreal, but it did not make up for lean and lacking script and clear characters. Norton was on the fringe (wasted) and Marlon (huge and lisping-looking healthy, though) seemed to be wasted here. De Niro is as usual busy and masterful but I found I was easily distracted and not paying great attention to this movie.  Was there a script or did Oz depend on actors to carry the dialogue and story along? VERY DISAPPOINTING.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This series suffers from too much hype and the overall 3.5 stars rating is fair.  It's a good read, but I was annoyed by all the details.  If I want to peruse the IKEA catalog, I'll do that, but I don't need it described to me in depth in a novel.  I haven't seen them but I think the movies might actually be better than the books because they have a lot of great action and the superfluous details won't be so distracting if they are just part of the scenery.
B000I5X81A|5.0|JJ Cale and Eric Clapton have two distinct styles, but on this CD they merge beautifully together,JJ is not only a great song writer, but a very good guitar player as well, if you listen you will hear he has very much influenced Mark Knofler also. This CD is also very well recorded.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is an awesome product and I love using it. I recommend this product to anyone who has to have thermal compound. I recommend your website to everyone because I received my product in a timely manner.  Thank you so much!!  Miguel Tenorio
B000002UAR|5.0|This is the original UK release of this audio CD. That may not really mean a lot to some people, but I have heard the US version and the original is far superior. The songs sound better, more solidity, clarity, or whatever you choose. This is a great album don't get me wrong, it's just that the UK gets the awesome edition of everything music-related. I'm not even talking about a special edition, but the whole point of what I am saying is just that this is really the version of Revolver that you want, if you do not have it yet. The Beatles were amazing and hearing the UK quality albums when those are available, is well worth it!
1935670913|5.0|One of the easiest things for writers to lose sight of is that this is a business. John Locke deals succinctly with the business aspects of selling books. Along the way he shares insights from his own experience--some quite revealing--selling books into the millions. Like any business he urges the seller to gear their product to the market they seek to address. This is revolutionary in terms of authorship, but should it be? After all, every other successful enterprise, even those that involve some type of art, consider their market.  I found this book extremely helpful and intend to put most, if not all, of his suggestions to work--and to the test.  I think that many will be curious why Locke decided to divulge so many of his secrets. Obviously some of this was necessary to sell this book, but one has to wonder why he wouldn't keep it all a secret. I believe I know the answer: he understands that more successful authors will expand the Kindle ecosystem.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This is a story of how Steve Jobs revolutionized and created whole industries: the Apple II that invented the personal computer industry, the Macintosh that popularized GUIs, the Pixar movies that revolutionalized animation, the iPod, iTunes which transformed the music industry, the iPhone which turned mobile phones into music, photo, email, video, and web devices, the app store which spawned a new content creation industry, and the iPad. The thought that went into the design and invention of everything from the casing of the friendly-looking Macintosh to the concept of an Apple store to the layout of the Apple campus demonstrates Jobs' drive for perfection, in terms of aesthetics, human interaction, user experience, and the bounds of technology.<br /><br />Steve Jobs knew that business is about passion and innovation, not mergers or sales. Although he was a showman who made product launches famous, and he worked on great advertising and branding, his main business genius lay in the boldness of his creative vision, pursuing 'not merely modest products advances based on focus groups but whole new devices and services that consumers did not yet know they needed.' Despite not being an engineer himself, he lived in the intersection between art and technology and demanded that his products be beautiful. Although he often displayed a lack of empathy by hurting even close friends by telling them they sucked, he put himself into the shoes of the customer, obsessing over the user experience and pushing his products to be as simple and intuitive to use as possible.<br /><br />Business lessons from Steve Jobs:<br />-'People do judge a book by its cover... If we present them in a creative, professional manner, we will impute the desired qualities.'<br />-Leadership: inspiring and pushing others, demanding perfection, demonstrating passion. He convinced Sculley to leave Pepsi for Apple by saying, 'Do you want to spend your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?'<br />-Focus: Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do. Figure out the things you want to dominate and cut the other stuff because they're draining your resources.<br />-On how controlling every aspect of the user experience by integrating iTunes and the iPad with Mac OS turned Apple from an ailing company dwarfed by Microsoft to the most valuable company on Earth: 'I had this crazy idea that we could sell just as many macs by advertising the iPod... We outspent everyone by a factor of about an hundred.'<br />-On persuading record companies to participate with iTunes: 'We used our small market share to our advantage by arguing that if the store turned out to be destructive it wouldn't destroy the entire universe.'<br /><br />The book talks about Jobs' family, his adoption, his cancer, but that story pales to the drama of Apple- in the story of Steve Jobs' life, his work had the starring role. Although he was often inconsiderate of other people, including his own family and friends, he was a hero to the human race. The inspiring tale of two best friends embarking on an adventure and founding a company brought tears to my eyes.  In Jobs' words, \\"Everything I do depends on other members of our species... And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species.\\": Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do.

6305252572|5.0|This is a great film. It's unique. It's no comedy but quite humorous. I would also hesitate to list it as an adventure film. It's a thriller but too much of the danger in the film is a reflection of the world around us. It can be a dark film at times. Did the cop make a mistake in the hotel lobby which cost another cop his life? The killer is certainly counting on it later in the film when they meet once more in an alley of Chinatown. After the shootout at the hotel Nolte discovers that the escapees were members of a gang who pulled off a big robbery and finds another member of the gang in jail. In this case he makes a deal with him who for for different reasons is also interested in the re-capture of Ganz and Billy Bear. The con is tempoarily released and they form a partnership for 48 hours. The two guys struggle to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. They depend upon one another more than they admit or care. At the start they may not be partners, brothers or friends but at the end they are effectively working like a team albeit a temporary one. Hollywood tried but could never recapture the success of 48 Hours but part of the problem was the film's use of anti-heros. Nick Nolte is no Dick Tracy. He's gone somewhat beserk but is resolute to bring both men to justice for the murders while Murphy realizes that he will lose everything if Nolte doesn't succeed. There was also very good support from the cast especially James Remar as Ganz the lunatic killer. The entire film was well written and put together. Find a good DVD and keep it in your library of films.
B002ZG981E|5.0|The more I watch this movie the more it unravels the complexity of our dream worlds. This film delves into those worlds showing how fragile the mind can be. To believe or not in our own reality. Are we dreaming? If not, how can we tell. The story line is incredible and the acting is superb, especially DiCaprio who is searching for his way home. Along with the script Hans Zimmer interweaves a \\"dream-like\\" soundtrack throughout the film to truly capture the moods, whether dreaming or awake. And that is just the point. Awake? Dreaming? Watch the film and answer for yourself. A definite five star movie.
0316056863|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this book. It was read by Tina Fey and pretty hilarious. Almost fell off my bus seat a couple times while commuting.
B00337MTA6|4.0|I tend to try to get some of the classics under my belt and this one I picked up at a book sale near my little town. Understanding the writer and the time period of the writing I kept an open mind on structure and language. I found this to be somewhat of a laborious read due to some of the old language. The characters were introduced well and I found that the more I got into their lives the more the story captivated me.<br /><br />The love or sometimes lack of love between Connie and Mellors kept a sort of twisted mental bondage that illustrated the type of wants and needs humans need. I learned to hate Clifford and understood better through this story the rift between the classes and how the breach was in some cases insurmountable.<br /><br />Lesson learned that a classic is just that if you let the message sink into your skin. This to me is not a quick read but a \\"take a moment and ponder\\" type of story.
B005IGVYUG|5.0|Don't have a lot to add to the other reviews, and you can listen to the audio samples to get a pretty good idea of what you are getting in to. I will say that if you get the CD, skip track 9 (Kiss Me). If you have the vinyl, I would't suggest possibly damaging the record, just maybe leave the room (go make a sandwich or something) during this track. That still isn't enough to deduct a star, as you are still left w/ 12 wonderful tracks, 15 if you get the deluxe version (which you should). Favorites (so far) are \\"Chicago\\", \\"Last Leaf\\" & \\"Tell Me\\", but as the time passes that may change.  I'll admit my main point in leaving a review is to try to bring it back to a 5 star rating to offset 1 star reviews from one dim bulb and one misguided soul.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|This is probably of the best albums that Brian put together. I highly recommend this DVD/CD to your collection. Monster Musicians, great selection of tunes, great interviews of the musicians. This is a \\"must have\\" DVD.
B003L77GRO|1.0|Enough has been said about the plot of the show. If the studio had done it right, I'd give it four stars, but they made a very obvious and sophomoric blunder that is inexcusable. The audio track for all 12 episodes is in mono audio, rather than stereo or surround sound. This would be fine if we were watching Columbo, but Dexter is a modern show with layered sound patterns and stereo music and a mono audio track simply does not work. Do not buy this product.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|As so often happens on Amazon, reviews for a single movie are grouped together for diff disc/releases.  Was reading a review of the High School reunion edition, now I'm on Flashback edition....one is one price, the other another, and one for $25+....a crap shoot, my friends, good luck!  BTW, the movie is a classic \\"brat pack\\", and worth owning.
0446547654|3.0|I stopped reading Nicholas Sparks' books because they had become so predictable.....fall in love, something bad tears them apart, someone dies.  This follows his predictable formula.  Sparks use to be a very talented writer, but somewhere along the way he has lost his spark and inspiration.
1451629184|5.0|Written in Jacyee's words, the account of her experience, her tragedy, her triumph over human torture.  The ending is worth everything in the beginning and in between.
B004M3H17Q|5.0|5 stars all the waayyyyy!!!!!!!!!!! James Blake is talented and it shows in the songs on this album. You may enjoy it as much as I have. Maybe not.
142311339X|5.0|It was a very good book. It was interesting to read about.     Rick Riordan had an interesting way of connecting Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter together. could wark a bit more on description though.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This little item worked great! We primarily used the SD card reader, which interacted well with the 4 GB SDHC card from our Canon pro camera (5d Mark III), as well as the cards from little point-and-shoot cameras of various brands.  For us, it was as simple as opening the Photos app, popping in the card, and importing. The import went pretty fast, and photos (whether JPEG or RAW) were easy to browse, download, and e-mail afterwards.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|love this app on my iphone and it works great, but wont work on my android based tablet(asus transformer). whenever i want to look at the \\"new and used items at $ option it says force stop and thats it! uninstalled!!
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|With my Prime membership, I'm just beginning to dig into the vaults so to speak. Firefly delivers on all levels: action, spaceships, gunslingers, intrigue, suspense, and above all, great acting. With The Avengers coming out next summer, I wanted to see what director Joss Whedon brings to the table outside of Buffy and he does not disappoint here. Tight direction, a perfect balance between character development and whiz bang moments, this show is impressive to say the least. Enjoy!
B00275EHJG|5.0|I have to say I was skeptical when the number 3 was placed beside toy story because by the third movie, characters are usually mundain and the story has exhausted itself to either something boring or stupid. NOT THE CASE, with Pixar.
0553801473|5.0|If you like science-fiction fantasy and have read the other books in this series, you will love this book. It is also a good book even if one has not read the earlier books in the series.
B004AKCME8|2.0|The movie doesn't stick to the books! It muddles two very important story lines, and doesn't leave room to fix it.
B004478GNI|3.0|I bought this for $15 and for that price, you can't go wrong.  It has a variable position wing that rotates and bends, which is nice, but also a bit flimsy.  The rest of the craft is quite sturdy and well designed.  For a child, it can be played with, but watch those wings - because of their ability to rotate and bend, it may fall off during play.  As for a display piece, it is ok.  It doesn't come with landing gears or a stand, but it does rest on 1 clear round cylinder piece that is strategically placed in the center of gravity of the craft.
0446547654|5.0|This, like all of his books, was a great read.  Although it did not unfold as expected, due to surprise twists and turns, it was still a wonderful story of love, loss and life changing decisions, written in a way only Nicholas Sparks can. All and all, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, touching love story.
B005G4TJUC|2.0|Not what I expected, the first Transformers was the best. The special effects was great but acting was not, too bad.
1419702203|5.0|This wonderful hardback is very difficult to review, as it is such a beautiful production! I just want to  rave about it which would hardly be of help to anyone. It is a biography told in images rather than words. There are photos of George Harrison as an infant, child, teenager, a Beatle, solo musician, adult, gardener and everything in between! The large size of the book allows the hundreds of photos to be viewed attentively and it is easy to spend a great deal of time with each photo. We are privileged to see documents relating to his schooling, his song-writing and his plans for his beloved Friar Park and much more too. Most of the photos are captioned and every now and then some text (in the form of a quotation) provides a greater understanding. I have had the book for over a week now and I haven't \\"read\\" it all yet! It is delicious spending the time meditating on each picture. I would like to thank Olivia in particular, and everyone else who contributed to this amazing book. I have been collecting \\"The Beatles\\" for over forty years now and this book is one of the very special treasures of my collection. I thoroughly recommend it to all who want to spend some time with our beloved George Harrison.

B002XMGGJM|5.0|The movie kept me guessing. Excellent suspenseful movie with good action scenes and solid acting.  Not a movie for small children or the faint of heart.
1400079144|4.0|Well if you loved the first two, then you'll love this one. The book picks up speed pretty quick, but after 2/3 of the way in it starts to slow down a little, and you begin to wish he would just get to the point already. Just like the first two this one is filled with interesting facts, mostly about washington D.C., and has lots of twists and turns.
0788811002|5.0|I like Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World. It's a good movie. I don't like the fact that Ratcliffe is back though.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My 5 year old loves everything princess, but how long will that last? So I thought these stickers would be a good idea. They turned out to be a great idea.  She loves them and they look great on her walls. Yes, there were enough to decorate 3 walls and her door.  We also had fun with the jewels that came with, making a jeweled \\"L\\" for Princess Layla's room. The stickers were easy to put up, Layla helped and none tore.
0064407667|5.0|I like The Bad Beginning (A Series of Unfortunate Events #1) by Lemony Snicket. It's sad that Klaus, Sunny, and Violet lose their parents in a fire.
1439133948|3.0|This book truly disappointed me. It semed like this book was hastily written with a mediocre plot line. While I was reading it I felt like Bujold was just in a hurry to get to the end of the book. If she's tired of writing this series, peraps she should just stop or kill Miles off. I read this book online for free. I am glad I didn't pay for it.
B00005JN0T|5.0|If you haven't watched this movie yet, or just want to rewatch, do so! Rent it, buy it, stream it, find some way to watch this entertaining action flick.<br /><br />One might say that this is the same old Will Smith, but that's really not a bad thing at all. Many people enjoy the smirking, cocky,  confident Will Smith. I too, am a big fan of this type of Will Smith acting. It's quite a joy to watch and entertaining, especially when he nails one-liners or catchphrases.<br /><br />Action in the movie is surprisingly well done. You'd think CGI wouldn't give you that full action feel, but producers and the crew did a good job meshing real life and CGI together. It was almost flawless, quite realistic really. I loved the intricate details, like the streets, TV segments, futuristic interfaces and items. In the movie, the future doesn't seem too far off. It's just filled with more technology. Values, cultures, etc. seemed to be relatively the same, which was cool.<br /><br />I found it impressive how well the sound and audio contributed to the movie. With some speakers or headphones, this movie really comes alive because of the impressive use of symphony, music, musical instruments, and many other sounds. The sound alone was thrilling and pulse pounding.<br /><br />The animation and CGI work of the robots was astounding. I've never seen facial and animated behavior looked so fluid and believable. Even in 2011, the work accomplished in I, Robot still stands as great CGI work.<br /><br />This movie is great for sci fi enthusiasts, action flick fans, Will Smith fans, and the general alike. There may be some crude jokes, but definitely tolerable.<br /><br />Check this movie out or watch it again, you'll be in for a fun and thrilling ride every time.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|I got this as a free app if the day. I haven't had a chance to play it since the initial download. Went to play it again and I get a notice, &quot;You do not own this app&quot;. I say again wth?

0812816641|5.0|I found this book extremely helpful, I previously owned a copy of this book, but the person I loaned it to didn't have the ability to remember to return it to me
B005PW3OS8|5.0|This movie was action packed and very entertaining. I don't think it could have been done any better than what it is. The computer generated graphics seem to transition to the reaction of the characters smoothly. Liked the vaporizing lazer guns that turned it's victims in to dust, real funny. For some reason, the energy blast from those lazer guns reminded me of G.I. Joe. I can't wait to see what the Avengers movie will be like. Hopefully, there will be a series of films for the Avengers story line. The previews I have seen so far don't have Wolverine, Spiderman, Black Panther, or the Hulk. I could be wrong, but I didn't see those characters. Just have to wait to find out who is actually in the movie when it gets released next year.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Fans of Showtime's \\"Dexter\\" owe Jeff Lindsay a huge debt thanks to his creation of Dexter Morgan.  Never has a serial killer seemed so sympathetic, so easy to identify with.  Season One of the famed Showtime series, now into its sixth season, comes almost entirely from this slim novel.  For the uninitiated, Dexter Morgan spends his days working as a surprisingly capable blood spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department.  Working closely with the detectives investigating Miami's nastiest homicides, Dexter's unique insight into the killer's mind has enabled him to solve many cases through unnervingly accurate hunches.   Why is he so attuned to the killer's mindset?  Because Dexter is a flat-out murderer.  Perhaps thanks to a childhood trauma (Dexter was found at 3 years old among the butchered body parts of his drug mule mother and her conspiring, ill-fate partners in crime).  His adoptive father, Harry Morgan, was a Miami homicide detective.  Harry recognized Dexter's need to kill things at an early age, and he made two surprising decisions.  First, he taught Dexter that some people deserved to die, so it was OK for Dexter to channel his urges if he was absolutely sure of his target's guilt.  Second, he taught Dexter how to cover his tracks.  And so it is that Dexter, armed with access to the Miami criminal database, seeks out the guilty and uses them to satisfy his Dark Passenger, the sinister force that lies inside his soul and demands blood.  All the great supporting characters from the Showtime series are here, albeit in somewhat abbreviated form.  We have Dexter's sister Debra, an ambitious cop laboring in Vice thanks to her beauty and inability to play politics. Rita, Dexter's unknowing fake girlfriend, is as damaged as ever. Angel Batista works a crime scene with bemused humor.  Fellow blood spatter expert Matsuoka tells horrible jokes and tries to fit in.  Lieutenant Laguerta leads the office with political skill despite the absence of detective talent.And the Ice Truck Killer leaves magnificently butchered bodies in his wake for Dexter to find.  Lindsay writes with poetic grace as we live inside Dexter's reptilian head.  Dexter, who claims to be unable to connect with humans, has a surprising gift for insight and observation, and his descriptions of the Dark Passenger merit several re-reads.  If you're looking for a thrilling, darkly comic insight into the mind of a killer, \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" is for you.
B005I64U5C|4.0|was very good
0060254920|5.0|My daughter-in-law suggested this book for my 4 year old grandson when I asked for birthday suggestions.  She told me every time they go to the library he insists on checking this one out.  He's a rough and tumble boy and this book contains the perfect subject matter to keep him interested.  It's not always easy to find books that little boys like.
B004856SQ8|4.0|Fun for an action packed and funny movie. It was a little predictable but whatever. It is very entertaining. I like watching it over and over.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|It's still one of the top 10 films ever made. Considering how old this picture is, the Blu-ray conversion is pretty good.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I feel conflicted with this one. I wasn't so sure about this one. I feel like I'm left in the middle of the road. Liking it but not liking it at the same time. I had wanted to like the romance part but that is where my conflicted feelings lie. Travis seemed so out of control through this and it actually had me worried for Abby. I wasn't sure where the line was when things would go from bad to worse.<br /><br />Travis was good at the beginning. Player, ladies man, brawler. But once the romance started, red flags were all over the place. He doesn't stay completely out of control, but I did side with America though. I had hoped that Abby would have stayed away. For her own good.  Travis just really set me on watch and I wasn't sure I was really able to get behind the couple when he seemed to react so badly to different things. I don't know guys. I think it just wasn't for me.
0060558121|5.0|The book begins with Shadow, the main character, getting out of jail and heading home on an airplane. On the plane he meets Mr. Wednesday who comments, in an omniscient voice, that a storm is coming. Shadow doesn't know it, but he has just stumbled into a war between the old and new gods who live in America. The old gods include but are not limited to Anansi from African myth, Kali and Vishnu from Hindu myth, Horus and Ka from Egyptian, Wisakedjak from Native American, and two main characters from Norse (I'm not going to say their name, I'm not giving anything else away.). In the novel, many of the old gods migrated to America when their people did the same, creating a mythological melting pot. As humans began inventing more technology and the industrial revolution occurred, new gods emerged. Gods for Internet, TV, cars, airplanes, and electricity. The old gods resent the power the new gods hold over the world and their envy leads inevitably to a clashing between the gods. Now if that doesn't sound interesting, I don't know what does!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book not just because the excellent writing, but for the themes in the book that revolve around the idea that humans create their own gods.
0385534639|4.0|I loved this book . It is unique to this particular genre.<br />The tents were wonderous. The pool of tears,the maze and wishing tree , all of this held me in the palm of this book's hand .<br />However, as much as I loved these details I was a disappointed that Marco's charachter, and Celia's as well, though not  to such a degree, were for the most part, left to our imaginations.<br />Ms. Morgenstern wrote a wonderful book, but sadly neglected to flesh out her two major charachters, or just decided not to for reasons of her own.<br />I should add that this didn't bother me while I was reading the book,  but afterwards realized that something was missing. I realized I knew little about Marco and less anout A.H., the man who adopted him or his plans for for the part Marco would play in the competition.Book keeping, even if done with magical panache just doesn't satisfy.<br />I could even say that I knew more knew more about Tsuikiko and the Burgess sisters than I did about Marco and Celia. We are given such  small, insignifigant insights into their overhwhelming love, I wanted to know why and given more.<br />Still, I gave this book 4 stars because although there were flaws I ate this book like a great meal and the only thing I felt afterwards was sorry I had gobbled it down in one bite.<br />In closing, I thoroughly enjoyed inmmmersing myself in 'The Night Circus' and if it existed I am sure I would be wearing a scarlet scarf.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385534639 The Night Circus]]
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest movie Disney has made. It reminds me when I was a child. Amazing movie that I will watch over and over again.
B005I64U5C|1.0|Beware, the \\"digital copy\\" included with this combo is NOT an actual digital copy.  It is access to a STREAMING copy, which you can only watch through Flixter's proprietary player.  You can download it, but that's still not a real digital copy.  That is still only watchable through Flixter's player on a computer.  There is no way to watch the downloaded copy on a tablet or ipod.  I wanted to watch it on my tablet, which does not have an internet connection.  I paid extra for the combo pack because it was a good value to have a digital copy, only to discover there is no such thing with this combo.  If you're buying this because it's a good value to get all three copies, do the math for just the two copies, unless you are okay with having a streaming copy as your third version and not a real digital copy.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|CD came on time, probably earlier than expected. Light packaging which is why the CD had a crack on the front when I opened it. Other than that, nothing to complain about.
B0000AUHPK|2.0|This film is probably one of the few adaptations that is reasonably faithful to the text, but the casting is ridiculous so it was hard to take seriously. The actors are too old to play the parts - they are in their 40s yet they play Catherine and Heathcliff in their teens. It is silly to see the pair giggling and acting like children (because in the book they were) when they are obviously so much older!  Juliette Binoche even plays young Catherine which adds to the ridiculousness of the role. I really wish the director had cast different actors.  Wuthering Heights is one of those books though, where it is just so difficult to convey all the passion and grief into film. So read the book!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|It even had the wrong address and still got to me within a week, My fault not theirs! DVD's were NOT scratched, Looked like NEW!!  Great Company!!  Will order from them again!!
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Seen a lot of Kung-Fu movies and this has to rank top 10 if not top 5 of all time.  The action scenes are very intense and well done along with great acting and storytelling.  The fight scene where Donnie is fighting 10 Japanese students was incredible.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|I've been watching this on you-tube for free non-stop. i must own a better version of this movie and the band i love during thier hay day.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|Recently purchased the DiDonato and Florez DVD, and while the two leads were great, it made me want to get out this version and watch it all over again!  This one has never been bested.  Good things always seemed to happen when director Ponelle and conductor Abbado came together.  Singing is fantastic, the production values wonderful, and there is a rare level of commitment and passion throughout.  The cast is absolutely perfect, every singer superb.  Desderi is a wonderful Dandini, comical, yet what a voice!  And Montarsolo is the quintessential basso buffo of Italian opera, where hamming it up comes with the territory.  As for the two leads, they are physically and musically perfect.  And Paul Plishka does seem an Alidoro descended straight from heaven!  I love opera in general, but Cenerentola is my favorite over anything by Wagner or Verdi, even though many would consider it hopelessly light weight.  If it is done right, you should feel very moved by the end of the opera.  It is all about--for once in this miserable world--goodness and love winning out over cruelty and stupidity.  The only other opera on DVD that leaves me feeling as good as this one does is the Bergman Magic Flute.  It too has a hero and heroine who seem to simply embody goodness and innocence.  Both productions show, too, that there can be real advantages to a film approach to opera rather than simply recording a live performance.  If you are having a bad day--or week--or month--this is the DVD to watch to cheer yourself up.

0307888681|5.0|Mr. Brooks' book was a surprisingly thought-provoking and entertaining read. If you were to remove the zombie dynamic, the story would still be a very good piece of fiction. How different nations and people reacted to a deadly paradigm is very realistic. The author successfully modeled his storyline in the interview manner of the late Studs Terkel's \\"The Good War.\\" This considerably reduces the tension of what may happen to the characters because you know they all survive. There are a few scary moments, but the main focus is on how governments and different cultures respond. Unlike, Mr. Terkel's outstanding, nonfiction interviews, Mr. Brooks fictional accounts seem just as believable. This is an amazing feat of well-written creativity. If the reader is looking for a lot of thrills, chills and gore, you will be sorely disappointed. If you, however, want an intelligent interpretation of how societies would respond to a life-altering event, you could do no better than Mr. Brooks' \\"World War Z.\\"
B005G4TJI4|1.0|very disappointing. The plot for sam was really lame, the woman they got for his fiance was the worst actress ive ever seen. pretty sure its because she is a model and doesnt know the first thing about acting. the movie was ok as an action movie but if you buy this expecting something on par with the first two movies you will be sadly disappointed.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|Just a great movie for my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter! She loved it and wants to watch it almost every day...
B001EGFQNU|4.0|The bonus dvd makes this purchase worthwhile.It's interesting to have the videos to go with the songs and this set offers a good retrospective of the band through the years.

B005LJK3AC|5.0|So funny I watched it 5 times! I laughed out loud through the entire movie. Cast is great, chemistry is believable, script is outstanding (dialogue is hilarious). Can't wait til this comes out on DVD. Don't get why so many gave low ratings. This movie is AWESOME! I guess this is a classic example of you either love it or hate it. Well, I loved it!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Hard to put down. Wish it had been longer book though. I would have loved to stay with the characters longer.
B005HS00NW|4.0|Es un buen disco... mas me gusto el cd1 que el 2. El cd 2 por momentos cae y se vuelve un poco aburrido, pero es cuestion de gustos y parecerees. Canciones como \\"midnight city\\" y \\"reunion\\" son simplemente espectaculares. Lo recomiendo...
B005HI4LLY|5.0|The set up is a lot like the recent installments of the Texas Chainsaw and Hills Have Eyes franchises or Wrong Turn.  A group of college kids go camping in the woods.  They're unnerved by the backwoods, hillbilly-chic locals.  And, naturally, they suspect the worst of them.  Perhaps for the first time in horror movie history, these kids assumptions were wrong.<br /><br />Tucker (Alan Tudyk; A Knight's Tale, 28 Days) and Dale (Tyler Labine; Rise of the Planet of the Apes, TV's Mad Love) are two loveable, kind-intentioned idiots on a bro-mantic fishing trip.  Their interactions with the campers are misconstrued such that they appear to have performed malevolent deeds.  After nearly drowning, Tucker and Dale save Ally (Katrina Bowden; Piranha 3D, 30 Rock) of the girls.  But when they pull her into their boat and yell \\"we have your friend\\" to the others, it is perceived that they \\"took\\" her and then cruelly goaded them.  Naturally, when Ally regains consciousness, she thinks she's been abducted.<br /><br />Just from the trailer I think everyone knew that this would just \\"work\\" on film.  This was Eli Craig's first job as director (he wrote this, too) and I'm itching to see what he does next.  He took a smart comic premise and peppered in some solid doses of Sam Raimi-esque gore.  As the kids try to \\"rescue\\" Ally from her \\"captors\\" they get accidently killed under silly circumstances delivered with perfect timing.  A true horror hound, I tend to laugh at many of the kills in serious horror flicks.  But this movie invites all to join in the laughter as mulched entrails shower over the face of a mortified friend.<br /><br />American Psycho and the Scream franchise may have mastered the slasher movie satire.  But this stands out as more of a paramount slasher movie farce, much as Shaun of the Dead was for zombie fare.
1904994679|5.0|My 8 year-old nephew loves this book which was given to him for his birthday and so far as I'm concerned, if he loves a book, I don't care what it is because it's a start for a lifelong love of  reading.  If you have a child who is reluctant to read, this is a perfect way to start him or her on the way to books, or Kindles!
B0036OS3OC|4.0|bought this pair to replace the white one I bought last year as the color became dirty-yellow(I don't recommend getting it for that reason). I love Crocs and this product is no exception--it's very light and very comfortable, and I got lots of compliments on its looks. The only thing is that it's good for fall+early winter, not for snowy conditions.
0316056863|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It includes interesting stories about her theater training, her early jobs, writing for SNL and her eventual creation of 30 Rock. It also includes some great stories about her personal life - awkward growing-up stories, dating, struggles to balance work and family life, and being successful in a male-dominated industry.   I liked the book best because she portrays herself as imperfect, yet she succeeds through vision, hard work and commitment to her team and her family.    Well worth reading.
034552554X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The characters were well developed, the plot was well thought out, and the language of flowers was educational.  I'll be recommending this one to my friends.
B003L77G10|3.0|We bought this second hand to save some bucks, and did save big time.  Shipped quick.  The only problem was that it skipped during one episode.  we got over it.  The show is extremly compelling  a great way to watch a series.  We are hooked on The Good Wife.  We are also hooked on watching a Series after its over.  No Commercials and you can just watch one after another.  I highly recommend this series and ordering the used copy.
0385344325|5.0|First of all, I love this series--always have.  It is one of the few book series that I \\"listen\\" to rather than read because Dick Hill reads Lee Child's books on CD and he is wonderful.  I always pre-order and when I slip the CD in my car player and hear Dick's voice it is just as I imagined that the character would sound like and it like visiting an old friend again--I always say \\"Welcome back, Jack\\" and settle in to listening to the latest book.  Where most of Lee Child's books are about Jack on the road so to speak this one is how and why he left the army and fills in the blanks about what happened.  Jack is as sharp as ever and the book brings in some of Jack's army team(as background characters) which I always love.  In this book, Jack is sent down to a base in Georgia as a \\"second\\" to the first army investigator who is on the base.  Jack's job basically is too hide the fact that he is an army cop and find out what the locals know about the death of a woman found outside of the base.  Of course, it ends up being alot more complicated and political.  Suffice it to say, Jack does find out what happened and solves it his way--which is not necessarily the Army way.  You will be in for a fine ride if you get this book!
B004TB6GUY|5.0|I'm not a BLS fan at all.  Every time I've tried to like a CD, I've always come away disappointed.  I've really wanted to like them, but it's never worked out...until now.  I love this CD!  It's like stoner-ish metal without the metal.  I'm assuming Zakk is singing?  Whoever is singing does a great job.  Very dark and metal like.  Lots of acoustic guitars, pianos, and killer solos.  I keep finding myself going back to this CD for more.    I hope Zakk does more like this.  Whatever the reason is that I like this and not BLS in general, it's working.  If you are expecting BLS metal songs, you will be disappointed.  If you like to put on headphones and enjoy different parts of the song and soak it all in, you will appreciate this.  In the end, it's all subjective and you may not like it the way I like it.
0446547654|2.0|Let me first start out by saying I either read or listen to every one of Nicholas Sparks books.  I have loved his characterizations the best--I love his descriptions of the characters and the environment that they are in.  I can actually almost picture these very people living in these towns.  Also, I can always count on the expected heart string pulls.  Sometimes things turn out well for the characters--sometimes they don't.  This is expected with Nicholas Sparks books and I accept that.  What I don't expect is the cop outs that are in this book..and the manipulations (well, more than usual anyway!).  It is as if Mr. Sparks did not know how to deal with the issue of whether a character should stay in her less than happy marriage(and with her kids) or go where her heart is--with her true love.  So he did the first cop out.(read the book and you'll know).  On top of that, when \\"it\\" happens, the book picks up two years later!!  What????!!!!  The book does not tell what she does at all when she finds out other than drop her phone! (2nd cop out!  Then added to this was how a family member lived through an accident (manipulative and way over the top).  There is alot more( yes, another ghost and other things) but I will stop now.  Mr. Sparks--don't do this anymore--please!
B001HPP2X2|5.0|Classic series. Intense and clever, the writing and direction is superb. This season's arch is very well plotted and the acting from the lead is fantastic. An elite television program, occasionally funny and always engrossing. A nice glimpse of isolation and longing with a very dark edge.
1439192812|5.0|I'm 27 and I have a very basic understanding of science. Took a biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy class in high school. And that's about the end of it. I am not so ignorant as many of the religious that I know that flat out deny science. There is a saying, 'too stupid for science, try religion!'   Some are so ignorant as to have no desire to understand why things are the way they are (and science explains 99.999999% of it!). Just accept what is in a book written 2,000 years ago when we had no idea what a rainbow was, what an earthquake was, what the sun was, how many stars were in the sky, what is gravity, what is calculus, what is physics, what is an element, what is a microscope, an electron, a proton, a nucleus, a bacteria, what water is made up of, proper sanitation, these guys who wrote the bible probably wore DIAPERS on their BUM-BUMS because they didn't have toilets back then. Completely oblivious to understanding life. We didn't have any idea how old the earth was until the 20th century (even Newton thought the earth was sub 10,000 years old!) and we didn't know about dinosaurs until the 19th century! A time when superstition was at 2000 year highs and scientific achievement at 2,000 year lows. Yet take what was written then at face value and forget about what we know today.   Anyways, if you understand science beyond the intermediate level then maybe this book is not for you. It is written for somebody that has less than a university level understanding of science.  But what makes the book interesting is the various myths that the bizarre non-science understanding groups of primitive species came up with over the last few thousand years.   Shocking to me that the Aztecs were at the height of their empire in the early 1500s (this was not that long ago --- and they were way smarter than the morons that wrote the bible 1400 years earlier). They had really psychotic religious beliefs. They believed in sun gods. And the first 4 had died. The fifth sun god liked lots of human sacrifices and blood. He liked hearts that were ripped out of humans and still beating. Just really psychotic and goes to show how silly religion is (because YOU would believe what they did if you were born in the 1400s during the Aztec empire in Mexico). You might even have been the priest that \\"surgically removed\\" by blade these hearts out of LIVE SACRIFICIAL HUMANS!  So it is about 75% science and 25% myths. It is a nice break up and makes for an interesting read.  I'd recommend to anyone of all ages. But especially if you have a high school or less understanding of science (I place myself in this category at almost 30 years old).  The second book I would recommend which I am reading now is Bill Bryson's \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" [...]  That will really get you up to speed on the fascinating world and history of science. And anyone can read it.  Back to Dawkins, the illustrations are great, the book is a quick read (less than 1 week easy), and is quite fascinating.   I enjoyed it and learned a lot! It is geared toward a younger more scientifically challenged audience.   I then went with a few other Atheist books:  1) Dan Barker's \\"Godless: How an Evangelical Preacher Became One of America's Leading Atheists\\"   2) Bertrand Russell's (he was born in the 1870s!) \\"Why I am not a Christian: and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects\\"  3) Daniel Dennett's \\"Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon\\"  and of last but not least:  4) Dawkins \\"The God Delusion\\"  All I am missing is Hitchens \\"Why God is Not Great\\" to have a nice little collection of facts going.  I am about halfway through Barker's book and it is really really good. I haven't read any of the others yet...
0307739961|5.0|I had wanted to read the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for a year or so and I finally decided to give it a shot.  It was definitely nothing like any other book I had read and I was literally mentally exhausted after reading the first few chapters, but I got through it and once the story picked up I fell in love with all of the characters and couldn't get enough. I was addicted to reading these books once I started them because I loved how they made me think/feel, how they made me sit at the edge of my seat at times, and how I would literally get goosebumps from some of the situations or dialogue.  Stieg Larsson was truly a master at writing because the way the journey plays out once you get to the Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest you feel a true kinship and sense of responsibility for Lizbeth Salander and when she finally got her time in the courtroom it actually brought tears to my eyes because it was just so awesome. I don't want to give anything away if you haven't read these books yet so that's why my review is a bit too cryptic.  Bottom line is: if you love crime, suspense, romance, or mystery novels, these books are all of those things rolled up in one.  Just read these books, you won't regret it.
B005DR64QE|4.0|First off the cast was great,this type of movie usually doesn't feature Academy award winning actors such as Nicholas Cage and Nicole Kidman.<br />Liana Liberato was a stand out as their rebellious daughter, she was recently seen in the movie 'Trust\\".<br />Cam Gigandet is as sexy as ever as one of the masked men who invade their home.<br />The four men that break in are desperate to get money because they owe a big drug dealer and their lives depend upon getting it.<br />The movie does venture into the scenario of good home invader,bad Home invader and really really sociopathic home invader.<br />The rest I really won't elaborate on because it would be spoilers.<br />I can tell you there are power struggles and that this family is not going to take it lying down.It isn't by any means in the same arena as 'Last House on Left or 'the Strangers',but a good home invasion movie all the same.
B0000509C4|2.0|Creepshow 2 was made on a budget that was less than half of its predecessor's, and it shows. There are only three stories compared to the first film's five.  As a result, the pacing is slowed considerably in each tale and you get the sense that the movie is just killing time.   The budget shortfalls really show in the film's main antagonists. The original creepshow featured  scary Zombies, a human plant, and a ferocious looking ape-like beast who jumps out of a crate and eats people.   The best that Creepshow 2 can come up with is a floating tarpaulin in a lake that melts peoples' skin off their bones.   The creep is no longer a three-dimensional animatronic creation.  He is sometimes a cartoon, and other times he's a guy walking around in a funny looking prosthetic mask.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Just read up on what Ultraviolet digital copies are and am shocked.  Just as everyone else says, you are not getting the digital copy you thought you were.  I am not paying for a multi-disk set after pre-ordering what I thought was a regular digital copy.  To the Movie studios- don't you realize Apple has the market cornered on media devices???  Why would I spend extra for a digital copy that won't work with my IPad or IPhone???  I mean seriously, do you think a 3 year term rental is really going to pay off for you in the middle of a recession???  Did you not just see what happened to Netflix???  Not exactly the smartest move, but hey I won't complain anymore.  You just gave me a reason to go buy Apple TV and a real digital copy from iTunes (which I'm pretty sure you won't make the same margin on).  Then I'll wait until I can get a blu-ray copy for 3$ after the hype is over.  Folks, just don't get the movie.  The only way to get the movie industry to change is to hit them in their pocket.  An unsuccessful release of a movie as big as HP would definitely help ensure they don't continue to pursue Ultraviolet.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Puss in Boots is an animated movie that makes me believe that a pussy cat and an egg can be best friends. Antonio Banderas provides the voice of Puss. Zach Galifianakis is the voice of Humpty Dumpty. They are two characters who grew up together in the film. Their bond of friendship is fun to watch develop in the movie. The story of Puss in Boots is actually based on a French fairy tale about a cat with a talent for stealing things.  The plot of the movie centers around Puss and Humpty searching for magic beans.  These magic beans grow into a bean stalk that leads to a giant's castle.  Inside the castle is a goose that lays golden eggs.  Nursery rhyme characters Jack and Jill are the villains in the film. Only the movie makers of Dream Works can breathe life and personality into these two characters.  I love the creative license of the animators.  There are two things about the movie that make it special.  The animation and music are excellent. My favorite scene has Puss sword  fighting and dancing with a female cat named Kitty Soft Paws.  She is voiced by Selma Hayek.  This scene in the movie is very funny.  I love the simple scenes of the movie.  One scene has Puss riding a horse in the back drop of a setting sun.  The film is scored by composer Henry Jackman.  His music gives the movie a sensual latin flair. There is a track of music in the film entitled \\"The Puss Suite\\".  This piece of music sounds so uplifting and heroic.  Rodrigo Y Gabriela are two latin guitar musicians.  They perform a track entitled \\"Diablo Rojo\\" in the film.  This instrumental  is upbeat and beautiful to listen to. Puss In Boots is a very entertaining animated film.  I like every aspect of it.
0920668372|2.0|I was given this book as a gift and at first just found it too sappy for my taste.  On the surface, it is about unconditional love.  But after reading it several times, what struck me is that the book only dwells on the negatives of each stage of the boy's development.  As a 2 year old, he's flushing things down the toilet and driving his mom crazy.  At 9, he's saying bad words and as a teenager, he's wearing strange clothes and has strange friends.  At the end of the day, the mom rocks and sings to her son, but only while he's sleeping.  Yes, my kids drive me a little crazy at times, but there are so many wonderful things at each stage and this book makes it seem like we love our kids despite the things they do.  It's so one-sided and weird to me.  I tell my kids I love them while they are awake.  There is just something off about the mom in this book, or just the way the story is told.   This isn't the worst book in the world, but I would never buy it for someone and I don't understand why it is so popular.
B00601J5CC|1.0|This show was slow, jumbled, and extremely boring.  It was like a haunted house with no story.  It's the type of show where nothing progresses and the weirdness of this nothing is supposed to be scary.  The creators of this show are going for all style and no substance.  They don't know how to effectively tell a story.  As a viewer, I am supposed to care about all these secrets the show is creating yet I know that when the secrets are revealed they are going to be big let down.  Don't invest your time in this series- I know you will regret it.
1423140591|5.0|Rick Riordan does it again in this The Son Of Neptune the action never stops and the emotion is overpowering. The kid that feels left out is now excepted. Why? Cause he kicks but and well he never was good with names LOL. But what do you say to a guy that isn't afraid to stand up to a Greek or Roman god and tell them jump in a lake, or better still have the lake jump on them.<br />The nice thing about this story is that we see how sometimes if we learn to forgive and forget we can really help each other. We see that sometimes when we think we are lame others think we are the coolest. We see that it isn't the lot you get in life that matters, but what you do with that lot.<br />Now if don't want your kid reading stuff about other gods then I would not recommend this book. Aside from that and the fighting thing it's a good book. Any kid that likes Harry Potter or Spiderwick will love it.The book is set in the here and now and says you can't see what is going on because of the mist, \\"something that makes our minds wrap logical reasons onto magical happenings.\\"
B005UKJX4E|1.0|The only redeeming quality is the photography.  Other than that, honestly it is the slowest, most confusing movie I've ever seen.
B004JMY312|5.0|A Halloween classic! This movie is all the Halloween fun without the scary ghosts, blood, and gore.  A perfect fit for movie night in October, this movie is a Halloween tradition in my family!  This movie is the type that we remember from our childhood - lots of fun without the \\"adult\\" humor, sexual themes, and nasty language that seems to plague almost all movies these days. If you're looking for a fun movie to watch with the kids this Halloween, check out Hocus Pocus.

B0042FZWC0|5.0|For those stuck living life the way they've been told to, this book underscores the type of thinking that allows you to make better decisions based on what YOU want, rather than what you are supposed to want. What I appreciated most about this book is the perspective from which the author writes. He doesn't provide a cliched \\"rags-to-riches\\" story, nor is he touting the millions of dollars he has made (which he hasn't). Instead he uses a barometer different from money to measure success: happiness and contentment. It's definitely worth a read if you are considering starting a business, changing your career, or making any other big change in your life.
0553801473|2.0|So I must have been one of the few people who actually like A Feast For Crows. At least something was happening in that book.<br />This just seemed like 1000 pages of people travelling around, showing us how many times they went to the toilet, every meal they ate (in exact detail!!!) and every other boring thing that ever happened to them while they are travelling.<br />It's like GRRM didn't know what to write, so he just filled the book with idle unimportant drivel just so he met a publishing deadline.<br />Very little, if nothing in this book was on any import at all. Did I need to see chapter apon chapter of Dani sitting around and whining about how hard it is to rule. That's just the parts that she wasn't crushing on a guy like a 10 year old.<br />Tyrion has gone from my favourite character, to just another boring page filler. Loosing all his charm and wit to stroll around the world, not doing much of anything.<br />John, whom I never really liked through any of the books, was the one saviour in this one. His chapters at least had some interesting bits in them. It's not that his story has gotten any better mind you, it's just that everything else has gotten SO bad, that he has, by effect been lifted up a little in the enjoyment stakes.<br />GRRM should have just done the 5 year jump and saved everyone the trouble of slogging through a tomb of a book which contains almost no plot progress.<br />I'm actually curious what was going through his head as he wrote this. Did he think the common reader wanted to forgo story just to read about the exact contents of every meal, what every river and boat and (never to be seen again) extra character was wearing and doing and acting like. Where was Sansa?? Little Finger? Rickon? Jamie and Brienne (and NO, One throwaway chapter giving nothing away does not count). What about the real Hound? The Mountain reanamated?<br />Thanks for ruining a great series GRMM.

0439023513|4.0|I have to say this was not at all what I was expecting in this book. I loved the first book and felt that the second lived up to the expectations set for it. The one negative thing i have to say about this book is that the movement and sort of feel the first two had was almost completely lost in this book. Almost every characters personality was changed. Though I i feel this enhanced the change the author was making to continue the series I wish that the author had kept some of the characters that i loved the same. What I did like about this book is that it was real. Katniss had to learn to deal with what she was dealt. It was not like suddenly a magical force came and everything was fixed, reality set in and every character had to learn to deal with it. I have to say even with all the changes this created to the series I still liked this book.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I always enjoy reading books. Another thing I enjoy is playing video games. I've been a video game fan since I was a kid.  This book is a very pleasant read for all video game fans. Especially ones that were growing up in the 80s. I thoroughly enjoyed all the references the book made to all the old video games and movies. There were some references that were a bit before my time, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the book. I even want to watch some of the old movies I read about, since they seem very interesting.  I bought this book on an impulse. I can't say I regret it. If anything, I was really happy I bought it. I couldn't even put my kindle down when I was around 70%.   I don't think you'll regret getting the book in any sense. I don't want to talk about the story or the characters because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the story is a very nice one that I'm sure you'll like. It's about online interactions, and making real friends. It has all the action sequences you'd expect in a sci-fi story.

Sidney showcases a wide range of emotional issues & how, as a rare pure-hearted soul, she struggles to cope with & press ahead of the obstacles thrown in her path.  The five-season series was at its best in the first year where Sidney discovers she's not in the CIA as she thought but rather in a rogue mafia-like organization. She subsequently becomes a double agent for the real CIA &, as you can imagine, the real fun begins.

0385737424|5.0|My 11-year-old daughter got this book over the summer and finished it in a single day. She couldn't put it down. A few months later our t.v. broke (we're a lot like Miranda and her mom) so we started reading When You Reach Me out loud. I expected the typical \\"spunky girl\\" book, to quote Miranda, but what I found was the kind of tale that should be designated as a classic. The story is brilliantly plotted, the characters are real and the humor is perfect. There is also real substance and imagination in this book. As if that isn't endorsement enough, my daughter told me it's her all-time favorite book - better than Twilight.
B0030ZOYJ0|2.0|This is a review of the DVD edition.  This is basically a retelling of episodes 1 through 6 of the original series.  Actually, let me correct that, it is essentially the original series, only condensed into two hours.  All the highlights from the original are here, essentially without change -- except to exaggerate them in unwelcome ways.  And in the process of condensing the story and attempting to intensify certain dramatic highlights, a lot of what made the original series worth watching has been lost.  The animation is essentially identical (save for the Angels, which are markedly improved).  The depth and nuance that made the original so surprising, has been lost in the translation.  The epic battles with the Angels, which kept you on edge throughout the original, lose most of their impact from being condensed to two minute vignettes, over and done with before you can start to care.  And the worst, the musical score is like something from a James Cameron movie.  Knowing where the original series was headed, in hindsight, the whole point behind Hideaki Anno's original project appears lost in the attempt to make everything bigger, brighter, and more marketable.  I hear the second is much better, and I can only hope so, having already purchased it.  If you're thinking of purchasing this, do yourself a big favor and purchase Neon Genesis: Evangelion discs 0:1 and 0:2 of the original anime series instead.
0446547654|3.0|I've long been a Nicholas Sparks fan reading most of his books more than 3 times each.  I'm not a fan of this one.  The story started out pretty close to the Notebook and that had me pretty excited but as the story went on I felt less and less interested in the characters.  It was hard to relate to any of them and that may just be me but it was very disappointing.  I've enjoyed all of Spark's books but this one fell pretty flat.  It did have a nice 40 to 60 page run closer to the end but I struggled to get through it in a way I never have before with a Nicholas Sparks book.
B005IGVYUG|3.0|This is another good-but-not-great release from TW,Inc, -- the brand templates all firmly in place.  NOTE: I liked \\"Talking at the Same Time\\" more the first time I heard it (in 1992....when it was called \\"Dirt in the Ground\\").  Grrr....
B0059XTTSM|5.0|A man who has a family history of mental illness begins seeing visions and having nightmares. His visions convince him that a massive storm is going to hit and he builds an underground shelter in his yard. His relationships with friends, family and his job are threatened due to his behavior. This is a riveting look at how mental illness can affect a family, and the acting is excellent. An emotional outburst in front of many of the townsfolk brings a perspective on how his condition has clouded his reality. This is one of the year's best.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|First off, you should know that this is a re-make of an original Swedish film, \\"Låt den r&auml;tte komma in\\". Do not let this dissuade you from watching this, but you should see the original as well.<br /><br />The original contains much less gratuitous violence, where as the American version seems to revile in it. This might be because an American perspective and expectations have demanded this of films for sometime. The Swedish film did contain violence, but in a way that left something to the imagination, and gave the general sense that the violence did not drive the story. A glaring difference in the sensibilities of American vs Swedish audiences accounts for there being much more nudity in the Swedish, which had to be worked around in the American. There is a point where having seen this almost shot for shot remake in the Swedish first, made some of the American dialogue seem pointless, were it not for the prior knowledge of what made certain lines pertinent to the story. There are other points however, that are made clearer in the American, such as the importance of puzzles, and who exactly the older man is. Either way, the strength of the story stands for itself, and can more than endure these glaring differences. The fact that the story deals with the mythology of vampires rather than out and out blood and violence is a fresh breath in the genre. The chilling aspects of this film are not what is normally used as a mechanism in most vampire films. The question of \\"letting someone in\\" is used to perhaps its fullest effect. Is one letting the vampire into their home, or to their heart? In the end, my opinion is that it doesn't matter what audience the screenplay is written for, therefore, see both this, and the Swedish. They are different enough to be entertaining so you can watch even though you know what happens, but you are rewarded with a different perspective.<br /><br />This is a film that will entertain you on the surface, but also challenges you to think deeper about what is really happening. From a purely entertainment point of view the movie works, yet on a critical perspective, the story takes on much more of a haunting feel, and you may feel completely different about the events and characters after multiple viewings.  You can see this as a coming of age / romantic film, but deeper down, it has chilling implications for its characters. Rarely does a film function on two levels so completely. You will appreciate this film much more if you watch the original \\"Låt den r&auml;tte komma in\\" and I strongly urge you to do so.really happening.

055357342X|1.0|I struggled through the first 3 of the \\"Game Of Thrones\\" series finding them chaotic, verbose, and a continuing struggle to read.    Book 1 \\"A Game of Thrones\\" has to be read slowly to get an identity of characters, especially those with similar names.  However, it was intriguing enough to cause me to purchase Book 2.  Book 2 \\"A Clash of Kings\\" expands on character identity, kind of boring but easier to read due to character carry over from book one.  No real conclusion so the reader is left hanging and waiting for some dynamic move forward ... so I purchased Book 3.  Book 3 \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is absolutely a tedious read.  I quick scanned through pages of irrelevant and boring information and struggled all the way to an inconclusive end that only anticipated that I would ever have enough patience to purchase the continuing saga ... which I won't.    I would judge this series as a monumental effort that is tedious, chaotic, slow and boring.  Most of the filler (words of no relevant consequence) could have been left out and perhaps a really exciting story could have been created.  Appears that RR Martin is paid by the word; not story line.  Blackthorn
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|An infamous cat befriends a female, and meets up with an old friend, an egg, sort a Humpty Dumpty. Together, they try to steal a goose who lays golden eggs, for reasons of enrichment, revenge or redemption. The Puss in Boots character is funny and very likeable. This is standard animated fare, but the animation is excellent, and the film is clever, funny and will be fun for the whole family to watch. This one does not rank with the terrific animated movies of recent years, but is certainly one that you should take the kids to see, as everyone will enjoy it.

0375758992|4.0|Really enjoyed this memoir. Some of the events were hard to imagine but apparently really happened. The author grew up tough!!
1451648537|5.0|This is a great book and ranks up there with my other favourite biography, Julius Caesar by Meier.  Jobs was a Nietzschean character with a strong will, ability, and a belief that he didn't have to play by anyone's rules. Perhaps he believed, being abandoned, that he owed the world absolutely nothing. His consolation was art; especially art through technology or engineering design. That's why I compare him to Julius Caesar, who was also needy, and sought consolation by achievement through military conquest. Neither man played by anyone's rules.  His lack of restraint made Jobs at times very cruel. For example, he made his parents, the ones who adopted him and scrimped and saved every penny to fulfill a promise that he would to to college, drop him off outside campus. He walked in, saying he wanted to be a footlose guy. But that doesn't ring true. Actually I believe he was ashamed of them. I know, because I was in a similar situation and felt the same emotion. But here's the rub. I didn't act on that feeling. It would have been hurtful and immoral to do so.  I don't believe there's such a thing as good people or bad people. We all have good impulses as well as bad ones. Sure we've all wanted to tell off someone, or simply walk out of a room rather than listen to a \\"bozo\\". But we usually think the better of it. Morality and respect for others is largely about making the choice to exercise restraint. Steve Jobs lived without external restraint, and it unleashed his creative will and energy, but it also made him a jerk.  It makes this biography a very interesting read too.  Issacson does a good job revealing this man, with all his faults as well as his virtues.  Jobs was a sensitive man, not a psychopath. He cried a lot. He was honest, if not viscerally raw, with himself and others. He left the world with great technological art. And he didn't manage to kill anyone, even accidentally (unlike Caesar).  So in the end, Steve, I have to say thank you for being here with us,and making the world a much more interesting place.
B004EPZ020|3.0|This is a prequel to the Paranormal Activity film, and this one shows how the haunting of Katie and her sister began. Once again, this one is full of tension, and the filmmakers have been able to maintain a level of quality through three films in the trilogy. The first was quite groundbreaking and hasn't been matched, but the second one was also quite good, the third to a lesser extent. There are some cheap scares in this one, but they provide a bit of levity at times. This should be the last of the trilogy, and is worth seeing.
1401902197|5.0|The book and CD are excellent sources of reinforcement and affirmation for living a successful and happy life. Since I often spend long periods of time in my car, it's easy and convenient to listen to the CD while I'm on the road.
B0052GACNM|5.0|What's not to like about Tony Bennett singing duets with contemporary artists?  It's interesting to hear new interpretations of standards by artists more associated with other genres.  Lady Gaga on a fun styling of \\"The Lady is a Tramp\\", Faith Hill without a trace of country on \\"It Had To Be You\\", and Amy Winehouse on, sadly, her last recording singing \\"Body and Soul\\" as though she means every word.

B004EPZ08E|5.0|The most successful black comedy since 1990's \\"The War of The Roses\\", \\"Horrible Bosses\\" is simply one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The plot deals with three best friends who share one element in common: they all have the boss from hell. The trio decide they have had enough and attempt a plot to kill their nasty employers by hiring a hitman.<br /><br /> What makes the movie work is the hilarious script and the wonderful acting of the leads and the excellent supporting cast. Jason Bateman is great to look at (as always), Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell (I actually didn't recognize him), and Jamie Fox give memorable performances, but for me the gem in this movie is the beautiful Jennifer Aniston. She plays a dentist who is nothing short of a sex maniac and is determined to bed her male dental assistant. Jennifer's portrayal borders on a combination of Joan Crawford/Bette Davis/Annie Wilkes/ and Alexis Carrington all rolled into one. Picture the biggest bitch you have ever seen portrayed in movies or television, multiply it by ten and you have this character. Aniston actually dyed her hair black for the role and the language that comes out of her mouth is similar to a sailor's who has been at sea for a year. Absolutely hilarious!<br /><br /> \\"Horrible Bosses\\" was a certified hit making over $200,000,000 at the box office and there is talk there will be a sequel.
B005UT29Z0|4.0|This is a film that presents a fictional company in the very real situation as the 2008 financial meltdown began. Profits have been high, but their business model of packaging mortgages together as securities to sell, is collapsing. A recently fired analyst brought forth information revealing that their potential losses are greater than the value of the company. This film presents the real-life scenario that some investment companies and banks faced, without confusing the viewer with too much information. The movie does not overdramatize the events, but is able to stay focused on the storyline, while also remaining interesting to those who may not have closely followed the real-life events.
0062011847|5.0|If you like Terry Pratchett's DiscWorld, you will like this book. I don't think it is one of the best, but I have only read it once. Besides, even Pratchett's not-the-best is still a lot better than most writers.    In this book, little Sam is growing and starting to explore the world as a six-year-old. It is great to see a protagonist who really enjoys being a father--even when his scion takes on a smelly classification project. Sam's wife, Lady Sybil, continues to be the love of his life, even when she traps him into taking a vacation in the country.   In the country and on vacation: Sam is very much out of his element. However, what Sam hates--injustice, law breaking, criminal plots--are all there just as in the city. Sam still has to deal with the Dark and his own darkness, which adds the usual extra level of suspense to the outcome.   For fans, a definite read. For not-yet fans, you will probably want to start with some of the earlier books so you are familiar with Sam Vines and Discworld before you read this novel.   As for me, I will end up reading it again, just like I have all of the Discworld books, when I need something to read that is light reading with depth of character and a twisting plot.

B002XMGGJM|5.0|This movie has a outstanding cast, a Awesome story, and a valid point.  This moovie starts out with a home invasion and every husband's and Fathers worst nightmare comming true.  It also tell how the worst part is not the crime it's self (Although very evil) but how the DA's Office would sacifice good people for a high conviction rate.  In this movie at some points you don't know who the bad guys are so you can't cheer for the good guys many twist and turns to a ending that is very fitting.  I enjoyed this movie because of the story and all the acting was done very well.  This movie dose have graphic violance, lots of cursing and some blood including violent crimes it dose earn it's R rating so I would not let the kids watch this movie but over all this is a awesome movie.
1451648537|2.0|Isaacson gave us some insight into Franklins life but he was extremely weak in the area of science and technology.  He has now confirmed the expectation of weak to no technical insight by what he said in his Jobs bio.  There are so many examples let's just consider two.  Isaacson compares Jobs to Franklin!  He compares a great product manager and bold PR guy to a scientist and inventor.  Franklin was an internationally respected scientist who published important ground breaking work on electricity.  Franklin invented (among other things) the lightning rod which is and will remain in use as long as man builds on land and moves on the oceans and seas.    Jobs?  It is not clear he invented anything at all but if he did does anyone think such inventions and associated products will be anywhere but the trash heap in 10 years?  Jobs science? Nonexistent!  It is common practice for the powerful in a company to force themselves onto patents.  Isaacson documents some instances of Jobs taking others ideas.  Such a person will not change unless he is caught and punished unless there is good and truthful documentation of actual inventive contributions.  Apples patents are weak, and mostly design patents with no technical content. This Jobs Biography will provide great fodder for having any obstructive Apple patents involving Jobs thrown out. Apple pays enormous penalties to real inventors who enforce their patents against Apple.  In this area Apple itself is a bully and we can safely assume that for most Jobs was the source of that attitude.  Finally the error that out shines them all!  Repeated in the book and on the boob-tube by Isaacson over and over following the advise of the head Nazi propagandist.  That a lie repeated over and over becomes a truth.    isaacson says that the Apple II was a breakthrough computer that made Apple a success.  Those of us on the ground in the 77-79 period knew the truth the Spreadsheet program Visicalc along with a the partial pc Apple II (did not include storage sold separately, screen sold separately - you get the idea). Had Visicalc choose differently among the 10s of great engineered PCs on the market competing with Apple, Apple might have become juice long ago.  The latter fact taught us and Apple that the customer was about solutions not computer horsepower.  Indeed great software has always been able to beat great General Hardware and it is still so.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|A young boy puts on a mask as his sister's boyfriend leaves the house. His breath sounds like he's breathing through a respirator, (part of the great sound effects). He grabs a cooking knife and walks in on his half naked sister where he proceeds to stab her to death. (Talk about sibling rivalry)! We only see it through the eyes of a mask. He exits the house in his blood-soaked clown suit, holding the knife, looking dazed and confused by the questions of his parents who just arrived home.<br /><br />Young Michael is institutionalized where he develops his pychopathology and his escape. Now a strong young man in a stolen hospital car he stalks a young high school student played by Jamie Lee Curtis at Halloween. Along the way, he kills a few other young people who plan connubial bliss or just completed it. In turn, he is being stalked by his psychiatrist, played by Donald Pleasance whose name happens to be Dan Loomis, the same name of a character from Psycho. Dr. Loomis knows that his escaped charge is pure evil, and he packs a Magnum .44 as proof of his intent to administer shock therapy.<br /><br />For some reason we never know why this hunk of evil dressed in black and a white mask wants to kill people or Jamie Lee Curtis' character, but he is intent on doing so even while she is baby-sitting two young boys. Telling you what happens here would tell you the end. I don't want to do that in case you have been living in a cave for the past thirty years. Suffice it to say that the killer walks very slow. The victims or victims to be frequently turn their back on him, and Michael seems indestructible.<br /><br />The movie contains a number of interesting elements. The mask was originally a Captain Kirk mask painted white. Jamie Lee Curtis started a genre in this movie as her mother did with \\"Psycho.\\" The movie isn't the least bit scary without the music and sound effects, and it is the only \\"Halloween\\" movie worth seeing. It was low-budget and made millions. The most frightening was how only the mask of the killer appeared out of the darkness, and you never see his face until the end, and then only briefly. (He looked like he had lazy eye).<br /><br />I saw this overseas in the theater on post. The whole squadron was there including spouses and spouselings. There wasn't a dry scream in the house.<br /><br />This film gave new meaning to the word Halloween.<br /><br />Happy Halloween!of the killer appeared out of the darkness, and you never see his face until the end, and then only briefly.

B0036TGSR6|2.0|I just don't understand how the director of \\"The Pianist\\" could possibly have directed this.  First, it's pure nonsense to have James Bond in an intellectual dual with Obi-Wan Kenobi.    There are other bits of nonsense in this book.  Americans don't care about Brits, and certainly don't care about the Hague -- so the idea of an ex British PM indicted for war crimes and that causing a media firestorm within America is absolutely ridiculous.  Also, America doesn't need to insert a CIA spy within the British administration to tell the Brits what to do -- the Brits are more than happy to follow the Americans anyway.  Then there's the ghost writer -- ghost writers are so because they have no thoughts of their own -- otherwise they would just be writers!    Roman -- seriously?  I know you don't like the Americans, but this movie is just drivel.

0393330435|1.0|Woz didn't invent the Personal Computer- unless a PC is defined as \\"a computer with keyboard entry but without display or large storage priced below Mini-computers and produced in the 1970's which was designed and possibly built in his garage by Steve Wozniak\\".  If on the other hand one defines a personal computer as a complete computer with storage, and removable magnetic storage, input and output, whose cost and operation are both reasonable to average people then the first one was made by HP in 1975.  The HP 65   Wozniak unlike Steve Jobs made significant Utility inventions that allowed Apple to deliver better screen displays (for games mainly) at relatively low cost helping to gain advantage for Apple in its first few years. As Stephen G. Wozniak he received patent number 4136359 for this invention.  Wozniak definitely helped Apple win the race for the desktop personal computer but they hardly were the inventors of such a category or class, just latecomers to the competition for dominance - which they lost long ago to IBM and Microsoft in the PC field.  Many technical people think the first Personal Computer was the Simon by Berkeley Labs which sold for $300 in 1950, before either Steve was born.  For someone who otherwise seems to seek the truth Woz disappoints big time in this poor job and excuse for a book. One is left thinking that all those doctoral honors made to Wozniak were for his cash donations or contacts to respective universities.

This book is told through pictures and text. how can anyone justify an audiobook version? i have a hard time with it even being adapted to film. The author did such a unique thing in the book. I feel like it's a tragedy to translate it into another format like that. The Time Traveler's Wife was the same way.

B00007KWHO|4.0|Yes' second record was recorded at Advision Studios in London between November 1969 and January 1970 with a release date of July 24, 1970. Jon Anderson wanted to bring in an orchestra for their second album but this didn't go over well with guitarist Peter Banks and after the recording sessions were finished, he was let go. The orchestra does tend to overpower the band in spots with Peter's parts, in particular, getting buried in the mix. The album featured two different covers, the EU one which is pictured here and an American one which featured the band including Steve Howe even though he doesn't even play on the album. The American cover is the back booklet cover in the Rhino remasters.<br /><br />The album starts of with a strong cover of Richie Havens on No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed. Jon Anderson's Then is a strong song and comes across well with the orchestra being a bit more restrained here. Everydays is a cover of Stephen Stills' Buffalo Springfield song and gets a wonderful re-imagining here. The first half of the album ends with one of Yes' best known early songs, Sweet Dreams. The second half of the album kicks off in high gear with The Prophet, Clear Days and Astral Traveller are good songs but the orchestra gets a bit in the way, in my opinion. The album ends with a strong reading of the classic song Time And A Word. The bonus songs consist of a couple of single versions of Dear Father and The Prophet as well as alternate mixes of No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed and Sweet Dreams. Overall, a very strong album but I prefer the first album a bit more.
B005EWDA3I|4.0|Having found Books 1&2 to be, while very readable, rather overlong and unfocused, I approached Book 3 with some trepidation. I hoped that the author might expand on some of the themes introduced earlier and reach a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed Book 3 significantly more. Aomame and Tengo are still looking for each other, while Ushikawa is trying to find Aomame on behalf of the Sakigake cult. The book now alternates amongst these three characters.<br /><br />The development of Ushikawa as one of the principal characters worked well, I thought. One of my reservations about the first volume was that both the lead characters were very passive - Ushikawa was more pro-active and this helped to move the somewhat flimsy plot along a bit more. By the end even Aomame and Tengo seemed finally willing to act to take control of their own lives - a very welcome development if long overdue. The conclusion was partially satisfying in that it provided a resolution for some of the characters; however, it still left some rather important plot elements hanging and some characters whom we had spent time getting to know were quietly dropped as if the author had lost interest in them.<br /><br />Rather strangely, there was a different translator for Book 3, Philip Gabriel, and while still very good, I didn't feel he matched the excellence of Jay Rubin. Rubin's rendering was so flowing that I mainly forgot I was reading a translation, whereas I was often reminded of this in Book 3 when Gabriel would use an awkward or very westernised turn of phrase.<br /><br />In summary, I still think the 3 books are seriously under-edited, would benefit from severe cutting of some of the unnecessary repetitions and fail to fully develop many of the themes that are touched on. However, the prose is very readable and the conclusion was rewarding enough that ultimately I am glad to have read them.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I grew up listening to Michael and I believe most of my values to this day can be found in many of his song. This movie was incredible and the disk it came on was amazing. Not a single scratch even tho I bought it used. I couldn't be happier with this product.
B000O3GCYQ|5.0|To anyone who wants a set of Jane Austen books but who, like me, is not in love with modern paperbacks, this is a very nice set.  The books are compact, attractive, and nice to handle.  I like the bindings, I like the look of the set, and I like the pages and typeset.  I bought this set in an antique store many years ago, and I don't know when they were printed, but I paid $60 and have never regretted the purchase.  To pay $90 some 30 years later seems to me like a very good deal.

1849386684|1.0|Justin Sandercoe is a fine guitar teacher.  Unfortunately, his song book falls very short of his reputation.  The book is more like a Lyrics book with chord names added as an afterthought.  The book should have been written in slash notation with the lyrics added below.  Too much is left to the imagination for a beginners book.  I wouldn't waste your money on this edition.
B005IZLPMY|2.0|Yep, next to someone amazingly pretty you very well might be ugly in comparison.  Here's the rub with this movie, it does somethings great.  Somethings look great, its close enough to the real story, but there's just enough things that aren't exactly on the money to ruin it and make the ugly bits really ugly.  The characters just don't have enough charisma and what ends up happening is a watered down mollified version of what was a very violent era.  It's more childish than a cartoon.  I love cartoons, when they are done well.  In all what you get isn't a clever adaption of how a real man can become IRON MAN, but rather G.I.JOE meets WWI.  As an example, we never get to see what the limits of Steve's new powers are, why is he so good at bouncing a shield... it just shines as a movie that got a lot right and needed more polish and was only mediocre compared to what could have been.  Blah blah blah, bitch and moan, I know.  Take it with a grain of salt, the movie may be aright for you, I own it and thought to myself... I should have bought THOR instead.  Take that internet.
B003Y5H57O|2.0|(Spoilers may follow)  If you have seen the 1982 Carpenter film, there aren't too many things that are new here. Very few things.  If you called this a \\"remake\\" instead of a \\"prequel\\", you wouldn't be wrong.  The studios obviously didn't want hardcore fans who loved the original to go into this thinking they would be getting the same \\"thing\\" (pun intended) over again and not bother with this movie. Instead labeling this movie as a \\"prequel\\" would be a better marketing move to attract new fans who have never seen the cult classic and thus would not have to fear disappointment for shelling out movie for this movie (if they disliked it).   The movie feels  more like a remake than a prequel. The same events that happen in 82 remake happen in 2011 remake.  I am not calling this a prequel since there is very little in the way of actual background to the origins of the thing. Where does \\"The Thing\\" come from? Nope writers never bothered to explain that.  What kind of species is it? Nope let's not explain that either. Where does it gain it's power? Nope.  I think this hurt the film significantly (since it has bombed in the box office since its opening). It would have been great to get some insight into how exactly the Thing came to earth. It would have shown me some initiative here to differentiate itself from Carpenter classic.  Everything that happens in the movie is pretty much lifted or inspired from the Carpenter film.  Plot: An alien craft lands in Antarctica (check), the expedition finds the craft and are threatened by the alien who came out of it (check). They slowly become prey for the creature who also begins to imitate the crew until all of them are wiped out (check).  Only differences between this and 82 classic is changing the script with the characters and circumstances in which the characters meet their ghastly end.  As you recall in the 82 film the American crew are the victims of the \\"Thing\\". In this one the Norwegians are the victims of the thing creature.To avoid the obvious comparisons of the 82 movie, director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and writers  decide to introduce a female hero(contrasting with Kurt Russell's MacReady).   There is as well definitely a lot more gore in this movie than the 82 movie.   The special effects were ok in some areas, and average in others. Some effects didn't even look like they were finished.  Don't know what else to add. It's pretty much a coin toss to see this movie.  I didn't think it was anything special. I've seen all this before. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either.

The figure as which he expresses a feeling straight seemed to be the characters of the Old Testament. I respected him who gives a speech at television or a university. Although he was surprised at his essence with this book, it came to respect increasingly him who tells people his naked truth rather.

The whole first half of the movie just shows them having sex.....I had enough once I saw the first sex scene.  You could tell this movie had a male producer or director because the nudity was all over the place.  I can't believe Anne Hathaway let the movie industry use her like that!  Even though I'm not crazy about her, this movie completely exploited her by showing her nude so many times, it finally got real old!  And the constant commercial for Pfizer and Viagra was just too much!  I wish I had the last 2 hours of my life back after seeing this stupid movie.  I'm just happy I didn't spend good money to see it at a theatre.

B005HIBWFW|4.0|A film that should have been released on dvd years ago finally gets its day! Ken Russell's biopic of Tchaikovsky was controversial way back in 1970 when it was originally released in theaters and remains so to this day. There are images in the film that 40 years later still stun the senses. But there are even more images thst are stunningly beautiful. Yes, Russell took quite a few historical liberties depicting the great composer's life, but as other reviewers have pointed out, Russell's approach is a combination of the factual with the almost surreal. As the opening title credit states, this is \\"Ken Russell's film...\\" which in this case is quite an understatement!! Chamberlain and Jackson give fine, and at times, manic performances. The supporting cast, many who would become Russell film regulars, also give strong performances. However, when all is said and done, the true 'star' here is Ken Russell himself. One of cinema's great polarizing filmmakers directs with the power of an artist who seems almost possessed. The Music Lovers is the second of three consecutive films made between 1969 and 1971(the first, Women In Love and the third, The Devils) which many admirers consider his best work. These three films are all controversial, beautifully photographed and completely unforgettable. As for the technical aspects of this dvd, MGM offers a nice widescreen 2:35 aspect ratio print. This is a DVD-R disc with no subtitles or chapters(very barebones) but the colors are bright and the images are sharp. Even as basic as this dvd has been manufactured, I've never seen this film look better. Recommended for Ken Russell enthusiast and those film lovers who enjoy bravura filmmaking!
1423140591|5.0|Rick Riordan Has done it again! This time we finally find out what happened to Percy. Was he out fighting his way thru monsters to find Anna Beth? Or was he at another camp not knowing anything like Jason?<br />I think that the book is very well written and a good read. If you haven't read the original Percy Jackson books or the first one then it will be confusing but otherwise you'll be okay. The new characters are well developed and fit in great with the older stories while still keeping the old characters and giving their roles still the same amount of thought.<br />  The central issue is that Percy, a demigod who is the son of Neptune (Poseidon), has lost all most all of his memory. After losing his memory he is sent to a roman demigod camp and he stays there for a couple of days. Then he is sent to Alaska to free \\"death\\", a god, from a giant.<br />  I realized that this book is not a continuation of the same story. It is another story about Percy instead of Jason. It also takes place 8 months after the other book, and it has new character and they only meet each other at the very end of the book.<br />  Although it seems that the story line is a bit young, the book is still good. When I was in sixth grade I began reading his other series about demigods and I loved them. I've read them all multiple times and then when this series came out, a continuation of the old series, I began to read them to find out what happens to Percy.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I enjoyed \\"Fast Five\\"  when I first saw it in a darkened theater last April. I enjoyed it even more when I shared the DVD with my wife. What Danny Ocean did to Las Vegas, Dom Toretto does to Rio de Janeiro. He assembles a cool crew of specialists to take down a big-time crime boss. The action is (pardon the pun) fast and furious. When Special Agent Hobbs is added to the mix, you have a really volatile combination. It was fun watching Vin and Dwayne go at each other.  The DVD is not big on special features, but the extended version adds a crucial minute that's missing in the theatrical version.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|I thought this was the touchless model. But it is not. It is the 'original model', where the pan has to be completely removed from the machine to be dumped out. I suggest buying the touchless model, as I have owned all 3 models that Swivel Sweeper has come out with, and it is by far the best. Don't buy the G2 model is is very poorly constructed. The Original, and Touchless models have typically lasted me about 3 years of constant daily use. The G2 model lasted 3 months.....
B00000IZOR|4.0|I had the wooden version of this toy when I was a child and it was a fun, sturdy favorite.  When my daughter received this phone for her birthday, it was disappointing.  It is now made of plastic, is lightweight and looks cheap.  Moreover, the handset cord was so short that you could not pick up the handset without also picking up the whole phone.  So, we just cut off the chord altogether.  My daughter does like to pick up the handset and cradle it between ear and shoulder, but that's about it.  She ignores the rest if the toy.

014241543X|5.0|Trying to defeat the effects of a gosh darn stuffy nose that won't depart? If so, this book definitely won't help you clear your sinuses.  \\"If I Stay\\" by Gayle Forman, is a soul gripping novel that invites you into the life of Mia, a young teen girl and accomplished musician. She is near death due to a horrendous turn of events, and must choose whether to fight to stay alive, or to let go of her earth-bound human body and succumb.  If you want to partake in a short teen/young adult piece of literature that makes you cry, disgusted, and smile all in the span of mere minutes, this is your story. Otherwise, move along, there's nothing to see here ...
B003PBB4ME|5.0|It's a great product, very inexpensive and it works well. I use it to mount my tm900k panasonic camcorder. And am not worried that it's gonna fall. It's easy to maneuver, and the camera can be adjusted to be further back on the track if you wish. This is like a floating camera craine. I love it.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|It's called \\"The Tree of Life\\" for a reason. Terrence Malick's film is a meditation on existence, an exploration of its meaning in a universe that is inconceivably vast and connected. This meditation takes place on two planes: on the Earthly plane, a nuclear family deals with the normal trials of growing up in a small 1950s Texas town; these human concerns are contrasted with existence on the cosmic plane, where natural forces, both macro- and micro-cosmic, lead to the eventual existence of the Texas family and provide a glimpse of what meaning their lives have in this grand scale, which will continue for billions of years after they are gone. Within this general outline the movie also contains many more perceptions, both obvious and difficult, as well as a beautifully realistic rendering of childhood. The performances and mise en scene created by Malick are astounding. Can anyone truly dismiss such a work of art with one star? This is a movie for people who are curious about life's mysteries. We all live, but evidently only some of us care to contemplate how and why.
B005ZB91KY|2.0|As a fan of action films, this one is disappointing; to me the super fake 'Hail' cries, English spoken with a German accent, poorly choreographed war, battle and fight scenes are just like seeing a bland person with a big hairdoo, or pouring a load of salt on under- or over-cooked food.  Save the funds, and see it on cable, or borrow a friend's copy.  The action is mostly trite, the acting and storyline seems massaged more than Kobe beef, and I actually stopped it 32 min. before it ended; I'll watch the rest today, cocktail in hand. The writers and director could've studied Spiderman a bit more, in order to understand what it takes for a filmgoer to give a damn about the character, how he develops, and what he says; this is some overcooked, watery pasta with tons of salt.  My brothers and I collected and read Marvel comics since the early 1970s and collected Capt. America and most others; I get the ideas they're going after, it just the film isn't well made and isn't fun. I really think they director messed up on details in the movie. I do not feel passionate enough to spend more time decrying it's dullness.
B000001GRE|3.0|Over the last few years, the Mahler 7th symphony - really one of his lesser-known works - has become probably my favorite of his music.  The powerful opening of allegro, the spooky first Nachtmusik, followed by a hellish, infernal Scherzo, and a lighter and parodic second Nachtmusik, capped by what I think is a less inspired finale, makes up a piece of music that is like no other I know.  Less angst-ridden than many other Mahler pieces, it is eerie and sparse, full of the marches and backbeats that are so important to Mahler's style and organization, and truly lives up to its nickname, the \\"Song of the Night.\\"<br /><br />I have been listening to the following recordings:<br /><br />Vaclav Neumann/Leipzig Gewandhaus Orch (5 stars):  I got this as a bargain-bin purchase years ago and it gradually became my favorite version of the 7th.  Neumann and his German orchestra perform with passion and commitment.  Neumann has an instinctive understanding of the structure, shown in marvelous passages, such as the thrilling recapitulation in the opening Allegro.  While the Gewandhaus orchestra isn't quite the equal of the outfits in the other recordings - in particular, the brass has an odd rounded sound that will be a bit strange for American listeners - their instinctive understanding of Mahler and the commitment and sense of engagement overrides minor imperfections.  Neumann tends to take things at a snappy, fast tempo, and the momentum this permits can be sensed right from the opening ominous beat of the 7th's opening.  The recording is from the late 1960s but the sound is actually very good.  This is a simply outstanding Mahler interpretation that many readers will not be aware of.  I think you will love it.<br /><br />Abbado/Berlin Philharmonic (5 stars):  While not quite on the inspired interpretive level of Neumann, Abbado leads a very good, musical rendition.  This is part of Abbado's complete Mahler symphony cycle done with the Berlin orchestra live on DG.  The recording sonics on this whole series are stunning and this disc is no exception, so that is an additional reason to listen to this excellent recording.  This Abbado cycle is sometimes a bit lackluster (e.g. the 6th symphony is absorbing and has a nice sense of flow but doesn't have the impact that the work should), but this 7th is consistently musical and played with verve.<br /><br />Boulez/Cleveland Orchestra (3 stars):  I agree with the common reaction that Boulez approaches Mahler with a more detached, objective attitude.  This negatively affects the result, I think.  While I very much like Boulez's interpretations of French and 20th-entury music (so this is a fan speaking), the style doesn't so much distort as fundamentally misunderstands Mahler's bitter mix of irony and passion.  The many reviewers who have given this recording five stars need to go back and listen to it and the Neumann to understand just how much is missing from Boulez's vision of Mahler.  Now for the positive: the Nachtmusik I and Finale are done absolutely excellently.  For some reason, Boulez is particularly alive during these movements.  The orchestral playing and precision are world class.  The recording sonics are terrific.  So this is a mixed achievement.  I would be happy to give it four stars but, to take some examples, the lack of power and structural understanding in the opening Allegro's recap or the passionless Scherzo just prevent this from being a successful version.<br /><br />Horenstein/New Philharmonia (3 stars): Although less known in his heyday, Jascha Horenstein rightly is esteemed for many of his excellent interpretations, including a beautiful Nielsen 5th symphony and several Mahler releases.  This extends to this fine 1969 live performance in London, which is musical, committed and often moving.  The problem is the mediocre recorded sound (Horenstein released through budget labels for most of his career).  If you are tolerant of sound issues or have a cheaper sound system, this is a very good performance that I think you will enjoy.  With better sound, I would assign it a 5-star rating.<br /><br />Abbado/Chicago Symphony (3 stars): When I acquired this recording, I assumed it would be my favorite one.  I purchased the Neumann soon after and found myself listening to the latter more and more and the earlier 1970s Abbado effort less and less.  In this recording, Abbado is Serious.  No one is having any fun.  The Chicago Symphony of course plays very well in technical terms, but it is dutiful.  OK, so it's still a pretty decent interpretation but unfortunately the digital transfer of the original analog is colorless and a bit harsh.  For a recording that is supposed to be technically outstanding, that is a big drawback.  I see no reason to listen to this version, especially with Abbado's very strong Berlin Phil version from the early 2000s available.<br /><br />Note that I have owned the Seiji Ozawa/Boston Symphony 7th on Philips (dishwater dull) but sold it too long ago for me to say anything but that it bored me.  I have never heard either the Leonard Bernstein or Klaus Tennstedt versions (for the future!).<br /><br />I hope you have found this helpful.  The 7th symphony is a special, unique expression from Mahler, one that repays its listeners over and over again.his is a very good performance that I think you will enjoy.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|The clarity on these movies are incredible.  It was well worth the money!  I remember going to the movie theater when I was a kid to see Empire Strikes back.  I have been a huge fan ever since.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because its hard to get the discs out of the case.  I fear that the way the case is set up that it may result in scratches down the road.  If you are a fan like I am do not let kids remove the discs.
0071762345|5.0|This is an empowering book for someone who is afraid to enter the realm of social media. It is truly the perfect introduction for someone like me, someone who desires to know more about what social media means, what it can and can't do, how to get involved, and how to stay interesting. Dave Kerpen is able to skillfully analyze why and how to create a successful presence online. He also has an impressive resume, working with over 250 companies including: Verizon, Neutrogena, and The National Multiple Sclerosis Society.  As more and more people are tuning out traditional advertisements such as television commercials, companies must find new ways to reach their customers. This book demonstrates how social media has become that answer.   Before reading this book, I had not considered the importance of the \\"Like\\" button and how powerful a tool such a simple click is becoming. Kerpen points out the astounding fact that the Like button is clicked over one billion times per day. Clearly, companies need to take note and react to this button. For example, if a friend of mine \\"Likes\\" a new restaurant in town, I am more likely to inquire or dine at that restaurant than I am to choose from a random search on Google. Kerpen recognizes that social media has enhanced the influence of \\"word of mouth\\".  Whether it is teaching you how to redefine your target audience, how to respond to negative comments, or reminding us that we must remain human, Kerpen's book is an excellent read if you have decided you are ready to post, tweet, and share.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|On the whole, I enjoyed this CD. I enjoy hearing the more familiar Christmas classics - and the arrangements were well done.  Having said that, the one selection that truly made me cringe is Schubert's 'Ave Maria'. First, I don't think it had any place on this particular Christmas album. It seems totally out-of-place with the other songs on the album. And is just my own personal opinion, but this selection is not one that I like hearing \\"crooned\\".  Secondly, Mr. Buble's diction was most offensive! It's clear that he never checked himself with a language coach ... or with any of the, I'm sure, thousands of recordings of this available out there. Interestingly, his Spanish in \\"Felix Navidad\\" is quite good.  I purchased this CD because I enjoy listening to Michael Buble. If, however, you're just in the market for a good Christmas CD, there are FAR BETTER ONES OUT THERE!
0307593312|1.0|I must preface this review by admitting that I did not read the English translation.  I read the original Japanese about one year ago and found it painfully boring.  So boring, that I have trouble remembering much of the story one year later.  There is the slight possibility that the English translation could improve on it but I doubt it.  It was originally released as a 3 book set.  The first volume barely held my interest, the second seemed just like filler, and the third was the worst.    I loved Norwegian Wood and that is why I found it so disappointing to read this silly book.

B000005YZM|5.0|OK, so this doesn't actually have every Zombie hit on it, but considering that they only released 2 albums (3 if you count the UK version of their first disc) it's still going to satisfy all of your cravings for British Invasion psychedelic pop. The Zombies still tour with vocalist Colin Blunstone and keyboard player/songwriter Rod Argent and their modern renditions of these songs sound just as amazing today as they did when first put to wax. \\"Care of Cell 44\\" is a high point, especially live! Read a review of their show at this link: [...]. In the meantime, pick up this disc and you will not be disappointed!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars deceives those who, in a superficial glance, believe it is a one more escapist series of adolescents and their little existential problems artificially exaggerated.   With its narrative inspired by \\"noir\\" films, with a critical and disillusioned vision of reality, the series serves as the B side of \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\" and many others of the genre. Or rather, uses this post-adolescent world to show what is hidden under the veil of hypocrisy in our daily relationships.   Some may argue that a character like Veronica hardly existed in the real world, but this matters little, since the importance of character is precisely unravel the secret side of the American Dream. No one better than Kristen Bell, with his cheerleader face, aggressive controlled action and melancholy look combined with fine irony, to play the heroine.  In the second season the series continues the excellent tying hooks, that bind us anxious to watch until the end. The only (and small) negative point, is the lack of short and smart introductions in flashbacks, present before each episode in the first season that helped us to follow the intricate plot.

B001E45XT4|4.0|I am happy with the headphones,as they might only be $28 they sound great with decent bass. They are by no means a set of Bose so dont expect them to sound that way and you wont be dissapointed. There were a few people who complained about build quality and I would have to disagree with them! They feel very sturdy ! They do fit a little snug but I'm sure they will loosen up after some use.Someone said that the foam isnt thick enough and that the speakers touch their ears,I think it's just a case of chubby kid with dumbo ears honestly. I wear a 7.5 hat and have respectably sized ears and they dont touch. I would have liked the foam to be a little better. Why dont manufactures use memory foam ? That would be nice if your like me and have gaming sessions that last 8+ hrs. As far as the guy who wrote that the adjustable head band broke&lt; I say wellthey probably got mad when someone Pwned and they eneed up being thrown at the wall. For less than $30 your gonna get a pretty good set of head phones,BTW dont think because they are a closed unit that it means they are noise cancelling by any means just less outside noise,refer back to the Bose comment.

0446585025|5.0|Ellen DeGeneres has never heard of \\"Begin with Yes,\\" but some days I think she could have written the book.  I am a big fan, and a quick look at her talk show ratings tells me I am not alone.  But for me, it's more than being a fan.  Her life has impacted me in a much more personal way, which I'll tell you about in a minute.<br /><br />But first, I know most people love Ellen because of her easy-going, sometimes quirky sense of humor and her ability to make us laugh so easily.  But I also think there's another more significant reason we're drawn to her.  Like most of us, she has had her share of difficult times, and we are inspired by the way she has faced them:  head on, staying true to self, maintaining that wonderful sense of humor and always believing that things could and would get better.<br /><br />Several years ago when Ellen \\"came out\\" on her sitcom (and in real life too), her career took a nose dive. Advertisers backed away, the ratings went into a free fall and her once popular television show was abruptly cancelled.  And although there had to be some anger, fear and hurt to slow her down, it clearly never stopped her.  One step at a time she kept moving forward.  And like many of you, Ellen didn't just happen to get to a better place, she actually rolled up her sleeves and figured out how to create one.<br /><br />Those of you who know me, or have read Begin with Yes or are on the Begin with Yes Facebook page know that I believe we are more powerful than we may think.  I also know how important it is to keep taking those small steps forward, even when we're overwhelmed, depressed, heartbroken, disappointed or just plain stuck.<br /><br />What you may have suspected but not known until now, is that I have also had my own share of ups and downs, difficult streaks, and even challenging years.  I won't burden you with all the details, but I do think it's important for you to know that my sense of optimism and hope didn't come from having a life that always unfolded easily.  Rather, it came from my gradual understanding that much of the unfolding was actually up to me.  I often write or speak to groups about what I'm learning along the way, and here are just a few relevant thoughts:<br /><br />What you may have suspected but not known until now, is that I have also had my own share of ups and downs, difficult streaks, and even challenging years.

And those are the ones we need to focus on first.<br /><br />And most of all, I've learned that deciding who to welcome in to our lives is one of the most important decisions we'll ever make.  So we need to choose wisely--and lovingly.<br /><br />And if you're reading this, you probably already know that the people I've invited in to my life are people who have faced challenges and disappointments, but who have figured out how to pick themselves up, dust themselves off and get on with their lives.  I've invited people in who I may never meet face-to-face, but who have been open, willing and brave enough to meet me heart-to-heart.  And finally, I've welcomed in people who have discovered that although it often feels like we're a world of many separate waves, when we join together, we understand deeply that we're really all justpart of a bigger ocean.<br /><br />And ironically, it's those ocean waves that have brought a message in a bottle for me to share.

0385344325|3.0|As a fan of the Jack Reacher Series, THE AFFAIR was ok; not good, but not bad. Lee Child takes the reader back to 1997 when our intrepid loner was still an Army MP on an undercover assignment to Carter Crossing, Mississippi. His assignment is to make nice with local law enforcement and relay what they know to his superiors. A young beautiful woman has been murdered. Her throat slit. Her bloodless body left in an alley. Her suspected killer, a solder stationed at the nearby base. A soldier who has powerful friends in Washington, D.C. Reacher has no trouble making nice to Elizabeth Devereaux. She is the county Sheriff and a former Marine MP and has linked Janice Mae Chapman's killing to two other dead beauties that the soldier dated. Ever loyal to the Army, Jack Reacher knows that this case will be his last. He will not participate in a cover up to protect one soldier.<br /><br />While the story is good, the telling gets tedious. Child repeats the 1997 references too often. Normally the reader gets up close to the serial killer and sees his or her psychology.<br />We don't get that here with the exception of the destroyed car.  We do see, but not fully understand the puppet-master of the cover-up. The Washington ties to the soldier are strong, but would Pentagon Officers really go the extremes as Child wrote to protect one soldier? I think not. And some of Reacher's actions didn't ring true to his character, but the beginning and ending are very strong as well as the character development: finally a strong female that mirrors Jack. The midnight train and tracks become characters as well as strong suspense devices. But true Jack Reacher fans will ignore the flaws of the novel because of the good story THE AFFAIR is.

0525423273|5.0|I bought Anna and the French kiss at least 3 months ago and I have one big BIG question here: Why did I read it before?! What was I thinking?! I mean, seriously, with all the good things I heard about this book how could I let 3 - not one but three!- months pass?!  Sigh... sorry xD It's just that this book was so so so funny! And touching, and hilarious, and cute, and sweet and... and... yeah, well, I know most of you know that already.  But you know what? I enjoyed this book a lot because I actually had to pass for something similar when I was younger. Why you ask? Well, when I was 18 I had to move to Brasil and although in the end I fell in love with the whole country and culture at the beginning I was devastated because, lets face it, most of my friends and my big crush were in Almeria (Spain). And in Anna's case she was forced to move to Paris and leave her best friend and possible future boyfriend in Atlanta. Which completely sucked big time.  But come on, we all knew that she was going to love Paris, who couldn't?! And for various reasons in fact, first of all, she writes reviews about movies and Paris is the perfect city to go and watch a movie every night without getting tired! Then it has the Louvre Museum, the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Élysées... do I have to say more?!  Anyway, Anna, being new and not knowing a word of French feels quite lost and abandon in this new city. No friends, no family, no language and new school. But things get way better when she meets Étienne St.Clair, a gorgeous, caring, sweet, funny and handsome boy that is the dream of every young girl. The reasons? Let me quote Anna for this:  \\"French name, English accent, American school. Anna confused\\".   Yes, he has the best qualities ever! He is sweet like the French people, his voice is sexy and beautiful and he is also from USA which means he understands her culture.  The only bad thing? He has a girlfriend. But we know the attraction is there, we can feel it even more than Anna canand it's obvious they want to be together and Stephanie does an amazing job building the tension in the right moments. I assure you that when nothing happens between them we are as disappointed as Anna is.  If, by any reason, you haven't read Anna and the French kiss yet go out and buy it now. It has everything a YA romance should have, is going to make you smile, is going to make you laugh so hard that you are going to need a few deep breaths to calm yourself and you will fall in love with Paris, Étienne and the way Stephanie writes.  Stephanie, you are an amazing addition to my favorite authors! You are not only unique but funny and great :D

I'm sure most of you know what this book is about but allow me to share it with more people, or at least with myself so I will remember how much I loved this book.  We begin with Lena explaining, in a few sentences, what is going to happen in ninety-five days: she will be cured, released from the most terrifying thing in the world... love. And she can barely wait for it to happen. She knows how awful is to fall in love, her best example was her mother, a suicidal... a woman who got sick and suffered the consequences.  But that's not going to happen to Lena, she is perfectly happy with her future. Love? Whatever, she doesn't need love, she knows what is best for her.  You see, The United States of America is now a fortress: no one goes in and no one gets out. And when you reach 18 you will have the \\"procedure\\" that will change your life forever: no more feelings, no more pain, everything will be perfect and you will be pair with a person that suits your needs. You will have kids and your life will be predictable but safe.  The day of her evaluation (a way to study who could be her pair and to know if she is \\"secure\\") she is with her best friend Hana. Completely different from her, Hana is strong and independent. And she knows that Love is not as bad as they say...  In the middle of her evaluation (that is going terribly...) Lena is interrupted by a stampede of cows and during the confusion she saw him... a gorgeous boy that winks at her before disappearing.  Alex is the one. The one that will make Lena's heart skip a beat, the one that will fill her stomach with butterflies, the one that will make her heart smile and feel... the one who will make her fall in love and get sick.  So what? Now she is sick and she doesn't care, she is happy. But if someone gets to know they are in love their perfect society would kill him and make the procedure on her before time risking her sanity.  In a personal note let me tell you something: I usually never pay attention to the quotes at the beginning of a chapter, they are, most likely not attractive for me but the quotes in Delirium? Pure perfection! Lauren Oliver creates each quote based on the world she built for Delirium and they are the best way to understand how this society works. I honestly never thought a quote could offer so much information, so much insight for a book.  And the ending came so fast, so suddenly that I had to go back a few pages to make sure I wasn't missing anything. I can't believe I'm gonna have to wait until March of 2012 to read the sequel but I'm sure it's going to be worthy. A book that makes me smile, laugh and cry is so worth the waiting.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|If you like \\"Les Mis\\" then this is the disk for you.  Bluray for both video and sound are spectacularly good.  I don't watch this kind of show over and over.  Except this one.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Does anyone have the Grapes of Wrath on Kindle? I would love to borrow it from somebody. It's an excellent book and I have read my copy so many times it's in pieces.
1451648537|5.0|Wow, I really liked this book. I was a little surprised by the number of reviewers who said this was merely okay. Maybe it's just that I haven't read too many biographies, or maybe because I wasn't that familiar with Steve beforehand, but I found this to be extremely engaging. Something about learning about Steve and his quirks and his experiences kindled a passion in me to be a better person and make a difference in the world. For me, that alone is worth 5 stars.
B004KKX814|5.0|this bey is cool.it has two modes.the only problem is the stickers!to much stickers.i recomened this bey!!!!!!!!!!!!hope you enjoy this bey
B004LROUNG|3.0|Almost stopped reading this book , but it got better so I kept reading. Just too much legal crap..his people were not that engaging.it started off good with David shucking it all..then kinda lost steam in the middle. I bought the book on my iPad. But will.  Not do that again , like reading on my kindle alot better
B0055SWM08|5.0|Puzzles to challenge your mind.  Music to ease your soul.  Fun achievements even for your failures.  A game for a rainy day.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am reading this book for the second time and it is even better. Oh my gosh Suzanne can write so amazingly well. This book is great, and I don't understand how anyone can give it a one star. The characters are sympathetic, the situations vary from tragic to funny. It is incrediblly quick paced, where I did not skip any pages. It was great all the way through. Great great great book.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This book pinned me to its pages until I had reached the end; I'm so glad I read it and didn't just see the movie. In fact, I won't ever see the movie now.I don't need to, and that's coming from a big movie fan. The reading experience was complete.   We in the Western world don't often encounter such terrible circumstances and yet we can identify so well with a hope that keeps us straining forward and engaged in living.
0618871713|5.0|Fun Home is a place strange, quirky and miss-able, but also stifling.  Bechdel's illustrations are more cartoonish than Knisley's (they remind me of Daniel Clowes) and so is her setting.  Bechdel's father spends his time decorating their Victorian house, perfecting it as a replica of an original  and turning it in to a museum.  It is this remarkable house that provides the backdrop for the story of Alison's coming out and the developing relationship between her and her father.  Fun Home is, like French Milk, a coming-of-age story.  Bechdel is growing up and beginning to gain the strange understanding that her parents are people, with secrets, and with whom she might have more in common than she could have imagined.  Bechdel is brilliant, and her book is littered with references to literature and history and philosophy, which set the scene as well.  I can't wait to read it again.

0156027321|5.0|Is this an optimistic tale of being lost at sea or a deep philosophical journey?  Yann Martel provides both in this prize winning novel about an Indian teen's early life and survival experience.  The author skillfully weaves 100 chapters together, covering Pi Patel's inner and outer experiences, plus some observations of his life from others.  This book will resonate with mature high school students and adults.  It is adventurous, earthy, brutal and shocking at times, but the atmosphere is often light and the main character is very appealing.  Pi Patel comes of age in modern, secularizing India.  His family owns and operates a zoo.  He experiences the terror of life and death at an early age.  He seeks answers in three religions.  He crafts a self-image as a religious, vegetarian, logical, self-aware and loyal son.  The family and the zoo animals are ship-wrecked on the journey to a new home in Canada.  Pi is given the opportunity to experience life to the fullest.  He learns more about himself and the nature of man.  He remains attracted to religion and nature.  He finds pleasure in crafting solutions to his challenges.  He learns to value food and culture.  Most of all, he becomes a story-teller, a crafter of meaning and order.  The line between reality and fantasy is often blurry, with Pi sharing a 227 day lifeboat journey with a tiger named Richard Parker.  This book, Pi Patel and his stories will stay with the reader for a long time.
1451648537|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  A complex soul, the book covered key aspects of the technical and personal journey of Steve Jobs.  I enjoyed, and was somewhat saddened, by the relationships Steve Jobs had with family and colleagues.  I was struck by the number of tearful meltdowns, attempts to redesign hospital equipment while deathly ill, and what a good movie this would make... if ever they could find someone to play him that could capture his real intensity.<br /><br />A very good biography, one I plan to read again.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Fun game but continuously and predictably crashes after 20 or so minutes.  Needs work to make it a worth while purchase.
B0001QNFXW|5.0|I see what the other review means about not showing the rest of the group more .... they had to be feelin' it the way they grooved.  They were TIGHT!  I mean, they were just in sync, and I would have loved to have seen more of them.  But Jay was groovin' too... his adlibs flow, his style of dance is all his own.  Only a true fan would appreciate all of the visual he gives.  I used to sing back up, and can appreciate the energy that flows when you perform.  The backround vocals throughout this concert are harmonious and I wish I was right there with them!  But my favorite tracks are Canned Heat, Bad Girls, High Times, the song with Beverly Knight (You've Been Tryin' to Mess with my Head, I think) and my favorite, favorite most favorite song is \\"Spend the Night Together\\"... I love the studio version of this, too. Virtual Insanity was good, but the other songs just blew me away.   Definately buy this concert...you won't be disappointed.
B005IZLPKQ|2.0|First, read the IMDB page long list of goofs (I know there's even more!). Very entertaining and informative.   Negatives:  Some background on the energy source would have made the story more coherent.   More of an explanation as to how all the  high tech gadgetry came about. A cop out to comic book fans who don't like to think while being entertained.   A more developed plot sequence on how the various HYDRA labs were to be attacked rather than just show up out of nowhere and start firing away. Again bowing to a certain comic book audience demographic.  Roles and acting such as Jones' character shows he tediously stuck in an actor's rut. Usual token roles again for Asians and blacks and the overdone female role portrayed by Atwell as romantic interest and tough girl just seemed tossed into the plot to satisfy both the male comic book audience and to widen the demographic viewer profile all for remunerative reasons.   Positives:  Evans portrayal of the Cap was good, but I'm not sure which body was his and which was morphed in.   Fairly good quality and not yet overly overboard dominance in the use of CGI - just enough to create a good fantasy atmosphere. They did seem to borrow props and scenes from The Thing and Sky Captain ... amongst others.   The story tie in with WWII was integrated with appropriate humor and where appropriate, seriousness. Even though there's boxes of old comics to draw from I think the script people did a good job although less of a comic book feel would have helped the movie.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|One of my all time favorites!  \\"I want adventure in the great, wide somewhere! I want it more than I can tell!\\"
B000H6SXMY|5.0|When I first read the reviews about this particular item, I was a little skeptical. However, I'm REALLY happy I bought this. I've grown tired of watching episodes on the CW waiting for my favorite ones to come on and NEVER getting a full episode on YOUTUBE and not having them streamed through NetFilx. Not only are NONE of the discs scratched but the BEST thing about them is that while they contain ALL the episodes in their entirety (meaning that what I've seen in reruns are cut-up episodes that don't hold a candle to these) the final episode is an extended version. Also, I have a big HD tv, and even though the episodes are presented in full-screen, they aren't blocked off by bars at the side, meaning that the episodes fill your ENTIRE TV. You also get a booklet containing the story behind the creation of \\"Friends\\", a brief description of each episode and if they have commentary with the creators and executive producers. Also, for each episode, if there's a famous guest star, it tells you who they are. Many of the discs also have special features including, but not limited to, previews of each episode. The discs are contained in six different booklets (one for each friend) and are covered by two pictures (one on each side) which show the characters at the first and tenth seasons. The discs themselves have pictures of their characters on them in various seasons. The number of episodes they contain are on the front of the booklets as well (1-43, 44-79, etc). The episodes are done in sequence, which you would expect, but the season premieres are all at the start of the disc they are on, which is just as well. I actually ended up paying less for this item than if I had bought the individual seasons. Even if they were used (which this set that I got wasn't) I probably saved close to $100. In fact, this products only flaw is that the episodes aren't divided by scene, but that is easily overlooked when you consider all the special features offered, the fact that these episodes ARE NOT cannibalised and their AMAZING price. I HIGHLY recommend this item to any die-hard \\"Friends\\" fan who doesn't own half or all of the seasons. If you own two or three seasons, get this set because you will SAVE money. If you own four or more seasons, well, you'll STILL get a great product.
B005HS00NW|5.0|Massive, epic, ridiculous in so many good ways.  At times I couldn't believe what I was hearing, kept having to get up and check what song it was.  Very highly recommended, and if you're even considering getting, do that right this moment.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|I wanted to like \\"Captain America\\" but the movie's faults made this a one-off--good enough to watch once, but probably not one of those that the viewer will watch over and over again over the years.  The characters had potential but did not live up to this potential.  Steve Rogers and Peggy Clark have a chaste little attraction going, but it never matures into anything of note in the film.  Steve Rogers himself lacks depth, and the film could have developed him, and his friend \\"Bucky\\" much more.  The same is true of the villains--they are one-dimensional bad guys and that is pretty much the end of it.<br /><br />The special effects are good, and I applaud that the movie is pretty much true to the original \\"Captain America\\" story.  I just think that this one could have been done better.  RJB.
0446615625|4.0|I liked this book.  This was my first Baldacci book. I read something about a recent book of his that sounded interesting, but it included characterless that supposedly were born in this book; so I started with it.  While you have to get over the bit of goofiness of the ability of the \\"Club\\" to exist in the first place and there are a couple of places where enlightenment hit the characters a bit too fast, it is just an enjoyable book if you like political intrigue. I will be back for more of Mr. Baldacci's work.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Love the game. Went to go check my updates &amp; there was one there. Phone kept telling me update failed. Finally I moved the app from sd card to phone &amp; update worked. I noticed the app doesn't have permission to update/modify sd card, so i'm not sure why I can move it to the sd card.  The game itself is fun &amp; challenging though...
B00007ECLA|5.0|I think this is a dvd that will appeal to any Laura fan.  Although it is from 2002 (and therefore older material).  It is still timeless that any fan will like.  I would like to see it released as a CD or on itunes.  In the end. It is well worth it!  Highly recommended!
B004QX07G4|5.0|This is the funniest book I've ever read. If you read it in public, be prepared to be embarrassed as you laugh out loud. I got her last book as a gift a few years ago, and it was funny, but this book beats it. I urge you to buy it, you will not be sorry. It's a feel good read, I was sad when it ended. Good job Ellen!
B005LJITS0|2.0|If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it comes awfully close.  Predictable to the point of cliche.  Decent (but not great) effects.  Not a single surprise. So-so soundtrack.  I haven't been so disappointed in a movie since \\"the incredible hulk\\" was previewed when the first Spiderman came out. Best part about the movie on demand is that I was able to resist instance purchase for 14.99 and go with the 24 hr. rental.  I saved eleven bucks!  Woo hoo!
B00571F26Y|1.0|I bought both the book and the tape.  I wanted to fully understand it.  It is nothing more than another repackaged low carb diet.  I've been wheat-free (and no sugary products) for 2+ weeks and so far ... nothing.  When you get close to the end of the book, he starts talking about REDUCING YOUR CARBS.  This goes far beyond wheat.  He says some folks might need to eat less than 30 carbs per day to lose the weight.  Again, this isn't just about wheat.  I know I can lose weight on less than 30 carbs per day if I do away with the wheat or not.  Why restrict beans, rice, potatoes, corn, etc., if taking the wheat out is so effective?  Obviously, it's not just about wheat.  It's about CARBS.  Wheat accounts for most of our CARBS so if you take that out, you will lose weight if you don't replace that with other carbs.  After sorting through all the words, it's all about carb reduction and a nice \\"spin to sell a lot of books.\\"   I really wish I could offer a different review because I want something that truly works but this is just my honest opinion.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|When I got this album and played it through start to end, only one thing went through my mind. This has everything you want in a metal album! Fast paced thrash riffs, slower heavy songs, lyrics you can remember and belt out down the road, and even a hidden surprise at the end! Anthrax are back in full force with Worship Music!
B005BW1IEE|5.0|I don't purchase much music anymore but heard a couple song from this cd and had to have it.  If your a fan of 3 doors you will not be dissappointed.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|If there is such a thing as Karma, then this country is incurring a lot of bad karma because of the way that we treat animals for food production.  The new method for raising chickens to improve production, besides providing less than a square foot to move around in, debeaking and so on, is to keep them in the dark.  Livestock are treated no better.  Cattle routinely roam around ankle deep in their own feces.  Think plant based foods are safe?  See this movie and find out the awful truth.  Especially pay attention to the politics of corn.  Learn how the FDA is hindering the growth of the organic food industry and, the localization of food production.  Discover some reasons why we may be so fat and sick in this country.  This film provided some mind blowing information that has dramatically changed my eating habits.  You owe it to yourself and your family to watch it.

B0041T4ML4|4.0|This is newspaper science, at best, a full-throttle attack on biotechnology and capitalism whose added global warming silliness should delight the EPA. Despite that, and certainly because of the title character's eventual triumph over unwilling sexual bondage, this is compelling dystopian story telling. One can only be grateful not to have to share the author's worldview---except in these small doses.
0307968502|4.0|This is one of my favorite recent contemporary books, and I was curious to see how the audiobook experience compared to the print version. This audiobook release was timed with the release of [[ASIN:0525423281 Lola and the Boy Next Door]] and I picked up both books to revisit.<br /><br />The audiobook narrator is Kim Mai Guest, who has narrated several books including [[ASIN:0142418528 Incarceron]], [[ASIN:0345523318 Dearly, Departed]], and [[ASIN:0385344155 The Autobiography of Mrs. Tom Thumb: A Novel]]. At first, the voice of Anna sounded a little bubblier than I imaged her. The narration reminded me a little of [[ASIN:0062112430 Delirium: The Special Edition]]'s Sarah Drew and her portrayal of Lena. However, Guest quickly won me over with her interpretation of Anna and delivers an authentic performance. She also capably handles the nuances of the other characters including their different accents. She even does a fine job with St. Clair's British accent, and captures the spirit of his character well. There is a roller coaster of emotions found in the book and Guest handles the different feelings needed with ease. The narration flowed well, and the only thing I wondered about is if it would have worked to have a male narrator for St. Clair and the other male roles. Not sure if I would have liked it more, but it did cross my mind.<br /><br />I loved revisiting this book again and the wonderful Paris setting. If you've never read Anna or want to read it again, try out the audio version. It's a treat to listen to and a swoon-worthy contemporary romance. I would definitely pick up other audiobooks narrated by Kim Mai Guest in the future.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|I understand that when this one came out few fans or music critics in the the UK or elsewhere gave it much attention.  At the time punk rock had followed on from glam rock, on the way to the new wave genre. None of these were ever my favourites.    Then some European radio stations started to play Sultans Of Swing and the single took off all over the world, bringing the album in it's wake.  Apart from Sultans Of Swing, I had very little knowledge of the remainder, although Down To The Waterline is excellent.  The rest have taken time to grow on me, but there is much to enjoy at a time when the band played without excessive keyboards and horns.  Bob Dylan was certainly listerning as he quickly enlisted Mark Knopfler on guitar and Pick Withers on drums for his 1979 album, Slow Train Coming.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|This game looks good, doesn't freeze or force close. It's a little boring for an adult, and but I think it's a game younger kids would enjoy.  I wouldn't call it a bejeweled clone, as the goal is swiping over multiple candies of the same type, not matching 3 in a row. Larger chains get more points and time back on the clock.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|The game is very good! Similar to games like Cut The Rope and Angry Birds due to addictive puzzle solving.
1423140591|5.0|I highly recommend this book to basically all ages. Especially for younger kids because it provides a great way to learn about Greek/Roman mythology in a modern setting as well as following a heart-warming tale of adventure and friendship. This book is another great step in the series, which has earned a permanent place of honor on my shelf next to Harry Potter and other classics that provide incredible comfort and continuously brings out the child in me! :)
B005LLXB9K|5.0|Pearl Jam was a focal point of my life in high school.  I feel fortunate to have witnessed their evolution and to understand the appreciation they receive (and deserve).  It was amazing to reflect on my own life as I watched the DVD and the footage collected from over the years.  Back in high school, I was a diehard Pearl Jam historian, but this DVD revealed more interesting facts about their experiences and emotions.  I highly suggest this documentary.  The two hours go by too quickly!
B004LZFWJO|3.0|The game is fairly polished and the graphics are smooth. But it's a very simple game, good for wasting a little time, and becomes boring after a while. Could certainly be developed further into something with additional elements.
B004ZGM76A|5.0|Far too many will write this movie off because of it's Depth.  With this one, you can no longer sit back in your recliner and relax having popcorn & a beer.  You have to think about what is happening in front of you and why it's occuring.  That's right, a movie you MUST think about to comprehend.  It's a relatively new, and for me, refreshing concept for Cinema.  And unless I'm just hopelessly dense (which I've admittedly been accused of) it will take you 2-3 times of watching to form an idea of what's going on.  Much like the hit-movie Inception)  Visually, one of the most eye-catching, awe-inspiring pieces of visual candy I'd EVER witnessed.  The explosions, creatures, monsters, dragons, women, surroundings - all beautifully and purposefully done in a way that one would IMAGINE in their mind...one would conjure up, to replace the terrible reality that had been forced upon them - in this case main character, Baby Doll.    Audibly, an unbelievably matched set of songs that FIT the movie in such a way that it feels as if the movie was written for them!  The absence of a single one of these would've detracted from the sense of purposefulness.  Each coming in at the exact moment they should and all combining for a seemless interpretation of events occuring before your eyes.  For me, to really understand what & why, I had to think back to when I was fighting Storm Troopers (tree limbs) at the age of 8 in a forest on my way to rescue Princess Leah.  It takes that kind of mental open-ness and flexibility.  If you're not up for that kind of investment than don't bother.  If you are up for it, your REWARD AWAITS, and it pays in Dividends.
B005UT29Z0|4.0|This story had a great beginning and some great actors. Unfortunately, not all the acting was great, which made some of the scenes go flat. I loved the concept, but the story lacked a bit of technical depth, which made it just a bit unrealistic. For viewers lacking a market or finance background, that might make it a bit more understandable. It shows a side of Wall Street firms that a lot of people are not familiar with. Watch and Enjoy if you like corporate/financial dramas.
0062060554|4.0|It would be easy, after reading this novel about a woman suffering a special kind of amnesia, to say \\"let's forget it.\\"  But that would being doing this first novel a disservice because it really is a notable effort, if somewhat lacking in certain respects.  To begin with, it is written by a man who, to this reader, is trying to think like a woman, but not really succeeding.<br /><br />It is the story of a woman named Christine, who obviously had a traumatic experience resulting in her loss of memory.  But not any ordinary memory loss.  No, she can't remember anything of her previous life when waking up each day.  So she has to be reminded, each morning after wakening, of even the most common chores; each day is a new learning period.  Then, after many fruitless medical attempts, a new doctor, Ed Nash, takes on her case, and slight progress in remembering takes place, leading to a twist at the conclusion.<br /><br />Christine's experiences lead to some interesting developments, keeping the reader wondering what comes next.  The role of the doctor is mechanical, and some of his medical observations seem stilted and persecutory.  It seems less than credible, for instance, that some people close to her could disappear from her life without a trace, only to make a cameo appearance at the end.  On the whole, however, while I found it a slow read, it was worth the effort, and is therefore recommended.

B005BGBPBG|3.0|Movie was ok. Typical and pretty well acted. Predictable. I watched it just after Bridesmaids, which was funnier and more interesting, or I might have ranked it higher. It just couldnt compete in the area of comedy. I cant recommend it as a must see, but if you have nothing else yo do, it can pass the time for you with a little interest involved.

0385534639|5.0|Every once in a while a book comes along that amazes you. That leaves you speechless, that leaves you incapable of words, that leaves you wondering how you're going to adequately review a book that is so much more than any words you can type. For me, The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is that book. I feel that no matter what I say, no matter what I write, my review will never, ever do justice to the amazingness of this book. I could type for days about how much I loved the book and I still wouldn't feel as if I had adequately gotten my point across. To really, truly believe just how good The Night Circus is, you simple have to read it. No amount of reviews you read, no amount of authors can tell you how good it is; you have to read it yourself and if you do read it (and I really think you should) then you should prepare to be amazed.<br /><br />The Night Circus is like no book I've ever read before. It's truly spectacular and, better yet, it's truly unique. I'm sure there are many books about circuses or about magic, but none will ever come close to how special and how utterly captivating The Night Circus is. It's not the kind of book I normally read - it isn't Chick Lit, it isn't a crime novel, it doesn't seem to have a genre but anybody who likes a good story will enjoy this. You don't have to be a circus fan, although it will probably help. You just have to like well-written fiction and you have to have a bit of an imagination. There are thousands of books published every week that say they're fiction, but The Night Circus is true, proper fiction. It's not something you can see happening, it's not true-to-life, it's good ol' fiction and it's stunning. It's fiction in its purest form, a proper story. Something I'll re-read many times, with a story I'll never forget.<br /><br />There are so many threads to The Night Circus, so many different elements and characters that help make the story what it is but it's so easy to keep it all going. The central plot is the circus itself, of course, but there are so many layers to the novel that it's hard to define just one main plot. It all adds up, it all comes together, all the strands, all the plots, to make an extraordinary read. There's Celia Bowen, daughter of Prospero the Enchantor; there's Marco, who came from nothing to be something; there's the other folks who live in the circus; there's a boy named Bailey who becomes a major part of the book; there's the Murray twins Widget and Poppet; there's Herr Thiessen, a clock-maker, and then there's the people who started Le Cirque des Reves. There's so much detail, so much thought that's gone into the novel and it's mind-blowing. There's not a chance I picked it all up during my first read and I'm going to have to read it again because it's the kind of book you can read again and again and I have no doubt that during the second read I'll notice things I never noticed before. It's that kind of novel.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern is a genius. She's a magician. Her mind must be an amazing place to be because The Night Circus is just so rich with detail. It's so captivating - so much so that I truly would love for The Night Circus to be real. I'd love to go and be part of that. The book just blew my mind. After reading it I can see why it's billed as the love story of the year, why it's billed as the best debut this year. Heck, it's one of the best debuts ever. It is truly one of the best books I have ever read. I literally found myself reading the book slowly on purpose. I didn't want it to end. I didn't want to reach the end because there was something so magical about reading about everybody. I grew to love the characters so, so much and all I can do is urge you to read the book. It's beautiful inside and out; the UK hardback is one of the most stunning books you will ever see, with so much detail having been put into it and the story inside is even better. It's the complete package. I will never read a book like The Night Circus again. It captivated me from page one and I loved every page. All of the hype is deserved, and more. Just read it, I swear you'll love it.one and I loved every page. All of the hype is deserved, and more. Just read it, I swear you'll love it.

B00280LYHS|5.0|I could not put it down at all!!! I am only 12 but i read really fast and i finished it in less than a day. filled with humour, suspense, twists and turns in the plot, and there were parts where i couldnt help it but cry. many people dont survive the fight against kronos but that just makes it all the more realistic. I love all the books by Rick Riordan including the 39 clues, The Kane Chronicles, Percy Jackson and the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus. simply AMAZING!!!!! 5 stars. i recommend it for all people ages 10 and up.

This book has turned out to be everything that I had hoped it would be and more.

Thoroughly recommend this book.

B0052U59F4|5.0|Redonk Nutshell: An intense physical attraction between a shy woman and an indulgent man leads to a deep and complicated attachment<br /><br />I came across this book through browsing around the Kindle store.  After reading the premise and the reviews I was intrigued enough to add it to my library.  I sped through it like a woman starved, incredibly grateful I had come across it.  I knew nothing of this author or her previous work, and had no idea what the history of this series was.  I'm excited to share it with you all, because I bet many of you will enjoy it.<br />A quick synopsis:  Anastasia Steele is a few weeks away from earning her degree at Washington State University. When her roommate Kate gets sick with the flu, Ana volunteers to take her place to do an interview with the illustrious Seattle CEO Christian Grey.  When Ana meets Christian she immediately senses a spark, an attraction so intense she finds herself struggling to keep her cool. When Christian shows up a few days later at her part time job, Ana entertains the notion he may share the attraction, though she's completely stunned that a man like Christian would have any interest in someone like her.<br /><br />Christian is a very private man.  Rich, brilliant and ambitious, Christan has no qualms about going after what he wants.  And what he wants is Anastasia.  The problem, however, is that she is completely ignorant of his lifestyle, a dark and secretive need to dominate.  He tries to warn her away from him, but neither can resist the pull of their attraction.  When he presents her with a legal contract detailing the depths of his expectations in their BDSM relationship, Ana is shocked.  She's never partaken in any sort of physical relationship let alone a Dom and Sub one.  But her feelings for Christian overule her worries, and she agrees to give it a try.<br /><br />What we get is an emotional rollercoaster of sensual awakening.  The attraction between these two is like gasoline to a raging fire.  What really makes this story shine, however, is watching these two struggle with the emotional ramifacations of their blooming emotional attachment.  It goes beyond physical, beyond the need to possess or dominate.  And neither or them know how to handle it.  It's dark, addictingly so.  It's a character driven story where our hero and heroine get way in over their heads.<br /><br />I really loved this story.  I found myself drawing comparisons to Twilight a few chapters in - really, it's impossible not to.  It's set in Washington state, our hero and heroine are mirror images to Bella and Edward, and the intense emotional and physical attraction to one another is remarkably similar.  Some might be disappointed by this.  I personally didn't mind.  In fact, I found myself reveling in it.  Afterall, how many of you out there are like me when reading the Twilight series and can't help but feel disappointed at the lac of erotic description.  Yeah, well, I'm Raunchy Ryan - I have NEEDS.  Fifty Shades of Grey reads almost like an super adult version of Twilight, minus the whole supernatural aspect.<br /><br />After finishing this (and book two) I did some research into this author - because I had to know who this person was and why I was only just now finding her - and it turns out Ms. James got her start writing Fanfiction for....get ready for it...Twilight.  HA!  Suddenly it all made sense.  I personally thought this was fantastic.  I don't mind fan fiction - in fact I like it.  What really made it for me, though, was the fact that Ms. James writes  just as well, if not better, than Stephanie Meyer.  The ridiculous teenage angst is replaced with brutally intense sensuality.  The stalker-esque mannerisms of Edward are addressed by our Ana, and it's done in a way that had me laughing and giggling like a moron.  I loved it.<br /><br />So...a few things to bear in mind should you opt to pick this baby up.  It's a series:  Book one is a major cliffhanger, so don't expect any HEA's.  Book two has something of an ending but we're definitely left wondering what's in store for book three, which has yet to be given a date of release.  Be prepared for Twilight XXX.  Whether or not you see this as s good or bad thing is most definitley subjective.  I myself enjoyed it immensely.  In fact, I'm earmarking this as one of my favorites for 2011.  Fo realz.  Hot, feisty, dark yet funny, and crazy emotional, Fifty Shades of Grey is fifty shades of fantastic.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James<br />(currently only availble through Amazon or The Writer's Coffee Shop or iTunes)<br /><br />Rating: B<br /><br />Romance: 3/5  Raunch: 5/5ly left wondering what's in store for book three, which has yet to be given a date of release.

B004HW7JMO|3.0|This series was NOT as good as the first. Since the orignal actor died and they used someone else it's just NOT the same. Also you can buy it much cheaper at Walmart brand new for only 19.98 with NO SHIPPING CHARGES.
1400052173|2.0|The problem I had with the book is that Skloot treats Henrietta and her family as victims.  Yet Henrietta was not harmed in any way by the taking of her cells - and no consent was required.  She was treated for her cancer for free by Johns Hopkins and she got the same treatment as white patients.  She was not treated differently.  Skloot acknowledges this.  For all her \\"concern\\" for Henrietta and her family, she portrays the family in very disrespectful terms - revealing all sorts of bad behavior completely unnecessary to tell the story of Henrietta and the cells, but apparently to add prurient interest and sell the book. She tells us that Henrietta had six children with her husband (who was probably a close cousin) before marrying him; that the oldest daughter was put into an insane asylum (and probably had epilepsy) where she died for lack of proper treatment (and no one from her family ever visited); her daughter Deborah was molested by her cousin, and she is not very bright either (demonstrated by all sorts of odd and bizarre behavior) - she also has her speaking in ungrammatical dialect.  And other family members are likewise shown to be less than stellar citizens.  Deborah's younger brother is jailed repeatedly for assaulting people, drugs, and theft.  Her son also has drug problems, etc.  The author says the family was victimized by the use of their mother's cells, but again I don't see how they were harmed - unless you believe they should have been paid.  Yet no one is paid - apparently even today for cells taken and used for research.  She also tries to claim they were damaged psychologically - but it's hard to see how they got worse than they already were by finding out about the cells.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I must agree with other people who said that this is Rick Riordan's best book yet! This book kept me on my toes and there weren't really any dull moments. I think the one thing I really like about this series is the way that he combines both Greek and Roman mythology. I don't want to give away the story, but know that if you loved the Percy Jackson series, you'll really love The Heroes of Olympus series. I can't wait to read book 2, The Son od Neptune.

B001NEK2GE|1.0|Bought a G13 when my existing controller, a Saitek Cyborg Command Unit failed after 6 years of service.  The Logitech G13 has great build quality and excellent key action, but proved to be totally unuseable.  I have always set up my controller to simulate the movement keys on the joystick.  The layout of the keys in relation to the joystick makes it impractical to use the joystick for  movement keys for more than 30 minutes - and you are unable to reach over half the keys without  moving your thumb off the joystick.    It was too uncomfortable to use for more than 30 minutes as it makes your thumb joint ache.  In comparison the Saitek Cyborg Command Unit was well designed and laid out and proved comfortable for  extended playing periods - and was just as programmable as the Logitech G13.  Unfortunately the Saitek controller has been discontinued.  I have since sold my G13 and bought a used Saitek Cyborg Command Unit which is miles better.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I just finished reading &quot;With the Old Breed&quot; for the second time.  I found the book to in be very well written.  Very few books capture my attention to the point that I almost feel like I'm sitting in the fox hole with Sledgehammer.  I had two uncles that were riflemen in the Marines.  Both fought in Island battles in the Pacific.  They never talked about it.  I highly recommend this book for your library.<br />Larry Pierce
B004LZFWJO|2.0|The Droid3 has a 4&quot; display, and the game does not scale up to fit the display. The most common sound I heard was the &quot;thock&quot; sound of the game thinking I had lifted my finger to stop a swype.  often this mistake would happen just after I firsted touched the screen, forcing me to really lift my finger to start over.  This control issue made the game unplayable.<br /><br />Other games and the Swype keyboard work great on the Droid3, so I suspect there was an unfortunate programming decion made that led to this failure.
0380725398|1.0|I started to read Jamaica Inn in preparation for seeing the HItchcock film of it, so I could appreciate how much and how well or ill the adaptation of it was.  I put the book down after about 140 pages.  It has utterly no sense of period, just like the standard historical-romance novels of 2011.  It's set some time shortly after the Napoleonic Wars concluded (1815), but might be happening in 1715, 1615, or even 1915, as long as the references to the nineteenth century were changed or expunged.  Du Maurier's ear is strictly middle-of-the-road 1930s; she apparently couldn't even appreciate the Cornish accents among which she lived.  The flatness of her diction makes the heavy sentiments that course through the book seem forced and artificial, and the characters seem hackneyed.  If you're looking for richness of language and convincing realization of period and place, don't bother with Jamaica Inn.
B005IS56CG|5.0|I've been an FFDP fan for years, and when I heard that they had another album coming out I immediately got on Amazon and pre-ordered it. I've been very impressed with the heavy tones of these songs, and the patriotic lyrics. When it comes to Heavy Metal, FFDP is one of the masters, and this album proves it again and again. Well worth the price too!  Highly recommended for Men (and Women) with raging hormones and patriotic values!   Now, back to head-banging.

B004LROUNG|4.0|Grisham's latest novel is set in Chicago. As other reviewers have noted, this book is more like his earlier books than some of his most recent. The hero, David Zinc, leaves a firm at the very top of the legal hierarchy in the first chapter, and winds up, by accident, at a firm at the very bottom. The rest of the book is about his experiences at that firm. As in Grisham's The King of Torts, a class action or mass torts suit is the heart of the plot, although various other types of \\"street law\\" come up, since David's new firm can't afford to turn down anyone who walks in the door. As with other Grisham novels, the characters are two-dimensional and painted with a broad brush, but there is a lot of action (for a legal novel) and the book is entertaining, with a satisfying ending. You won't be disappointed if you are a Grisham fan or only liked his earlier works. Chicago is convincingly portrayed as well, at least to me, a native Chicagoan. I have only one quibble: Chicagoans I know would take an \\"el\\" from downtown to Lincoln Park, as there is no \\"train.\\" The CTA may call them trains but no one I know does. There are many other details, all accurate, as far as I know. Most of his books, as does this one, focus on inequities in our justice system, inequities that call for reform. Few authors today who write in this vein reach such large audiences, and the fact that Grisham continues to do so is to his credit, and to our benefit.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|True magic is maddening.  It is beautiful in its hope that there might be something more than meets the eye, but it is frustrating in that few mere mortals can glimpse behind that curtain.  The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern must be true magic.  It is both beautiful and frustrating.<br /><br />The Night Circus begins as a story of The Man in the Grey Suit and Prospero the Enchanter competing to determine whose prot&eacute;g&eacute;e is the better magician.  The Man's pupil is an orphan named Marco, and under Prospero's tutelage is his daughter, Celia.  The arena for such magic is an enchanted circus that only opens from dusk til dawn. The circus is populated with acrobats, an illusionist, a fortune teller, twin seers who train kittens, and a contortionist who \\"although she twists her body into unimaginable and painful looking positions, her beatific smile remains in place.\\"<br /><br />But the main character is the circus itself.  In one of the endless black and white striped tents is an ice garden.  In another, a labyrinth.  One tent called \\"Bedtime Stories\\" holds a table with various bottles and jars of all shapes and sizes.  Bailey picks up a mason jar and unscrews the lid.  The scent that drifts up is ocean, sunshine and the sound is gulls and waves.  \\"There is something mysterious as well, something fantastical.  The flag of a pirate ship on the far horizon, a mermaid's tail flipping out of sight behind a wave.\\"<br /><br />The magic to The Night Circus is its imagery, language, and characters.  Morgenstern creates sheer poetry.  But like magic, she holds the reader at arm's length in terms of meaning.  Are the Man and Prospero like God and the Devil competing for souls?  Is this book about passion versus reason?  Reality versus illusion?  I wish I knew.  I can appreciate its poetry but can't figure out what's behind the curtain.  So, The Night Circus is a book for readers willing to forgo meaning in order to behold the beauty of language.
0307593312|4.0|This book is split into three books. The first book is exciting, mysterious, and classic Murakami. The second book slowly devolves into a detective novel, but is still passable. The interlude describing a town of cats is rich in allegory. However, the third book is a big heaping of copypasta, rehashing the same events using the same words from slightly differing points of view. In the third book, characters continuously use their \\"intuition\\" to figure things out in lieu of realistic explanations, and the cumulative name-dropping of classical musicians and famous brand names becomes unbearable. One line in the ending about a billboard with a tiger was meant to be mysterious, but instead freaked me out like a horror film. I recommend obtaining 1Q84 but reading no farther than the end of the second book, because incompleteness is a more genuine experience than finishing the book and being left with a sucked-in-and-spit-out feeling.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|This is a great case. It fits the AT&T version (i777) just fine, but the screen protector is wrong, so you'll need to get your own if you want to use this case, which I highly recommend.<br /><br />The micro USB port is a bit tight, so if you have any cables with big clunky connectors, you will need to shave them down a bit. The cable that comes with the phone works just fine, so does the cable that came with my Nexus One.

So in an attempt to fight hospital boredom I went to this disk and got out the digital copy paper insert then went to the warner Brother special website and tried to download my digital copy and found out the the time limit has expired on May 6, 2011 for getting the digital copy on to my ipad!?!?! EXPIRED?!?!<br /><br />This is officially my LAST Warner Brothers movie I ever put on my wish list nor will I ever buy another Warner Brother blu-ray intentionally.<br /><br />The movie gets 4 stars for me but my review gets turned in to a 1 star for Warner Brothers DEVALUING of my good friends gift to me. When I talked with my friend who gave me this copy he was embarrassed as well and also swore to not buy Warner Brother blu-rays anymore if they keep up this digital copy expiration date sillyness.<br /><br />I hope no one cites DRM/CSS or illegal downloading reasons as an excuse for this crap. I could break the blu-ray CSS routine in less than 5 min if I were a nefarious customer. I'm not, I do not support theft, but that is exactly what I think Warner Brothers has driven me to do in this instance. If I want to use this blu-ray digital copy they are FORCING ME to become a pirate.<br /><br />It's a real shame that I have to ruin the reputation of the good movie Inception with Warner Brothers inability to build a viable business model. Booo on you media fat cats.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|No one will read this and it will probably be down voted but I have to say it.  The action is decently exciting but lacking in too many aspects.  The premise does not make any sense when you think about it at any length.  Simple plot holes ate away at my attention the entire time. (like where were these cameras during the games are they invisible?  I figure the premise was supposed to be similar to the Roman games but without the societal structure backing it, it didn't make sense that it was accepted within this world.    The characters were two dimensional, at least they had another dimension over twilight characters.  How can one possibly treat the people who put them through a death game with respect?  The answer there is you look at them with the eyes of a wild animal that has beaten and tortured by its captor.  The novel completely goes against the human condition.  The only thing it touches on is, that one can care for another in the face of death.  That's a horse that has been beaten to death.    My suggestion read \\"Ender's Game\\", Suzanne Collins obviously did.  She borrowed a lot from \\"Ender's Game\\" and it's quite obvious.  If you want one of the best books ever written on survival read \\"Call of the Wild\\".  It explains how one should think in a game of death and dominance.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|In trying to get over jet lag, I started reading The Night Circus and couldn't stop. It was simply a beautiful, magical story. There is a soft spot in my heart for Cirque du Soleil, and this story captures the essence of the circus perfectly!  I loved how all the different intersersecting story lines marries perfectly at the conclusion.  Perhaps in trying to read myself to sleep I should have picked up my old calculus textbook instead :) I now consider myself a reveurs!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I would first like to thank the other reviewers of this product, without everyones input, I would have had doubts on this purchase.  Now on to my take on these headphones:<br />1) They are quite comfortable and easy to adjust to one's cranial needs (which for me is a big deal, considering my head is on the larger side).<br />2) The cushions offer noise cancellation to the max and have not made my ears feel sweaty (and I have read that they need replacing after one year of use. This for me seems reasonable because of cleanliness).<br />3) They easily fold up and down for safe keeping in the nice sony case.<br />4) The sound quality (which is in my opinion is most important) is very luxurious! I am continually listening through my favorite songs and discovering the hidden sounds that cheap headphones will never yield.  These are also great for recording and mixing.  Breaking these in is the key to get the full depth and clarity that all have described about these headphones.<br />I will definitely be putting these to good use.  I highly recommend sony's mdr7506's to any individual obsessed with tone and audio.

1401324029|4.0|Yeah, I'm a fan of the TV show Castle.  I love the characters and the story lines, and I think the actors have a great rapport with each other.  Having said that, I'm still somewhat embarrassed to admit I decided to read the Nikki Heat novels that \\"Richard Castle\\" wrote.  For those of you who haven't watched the show, Richard Castle is the character who's a writer and hangs out with the NYPD as \\"research\\" for his next novel.  Detective Kate Beckett is the lead, and she's the inspiration for his Nikki Heat novels that have revived his writing career.  So this novel, Naked Heat, is the real version of the fictional novel by the fictional writer in the fictional TV show.<br /><br />Got all that?<br /><br />Anyway... Naked Heat is exactly what I expected it to be in terms of style and content.  It's a fun read that plays out in my mind as an episode of Castle.  Perhaps if you read the novel without having seen the show, you'd end up with a whole different impression.  Regardless, it really doesn't matter.  It's what I would consider a beach read, an entertaining crime novel with good character interaction and plenty of plot twists.  In this \\"episode\\", Heat is called on to solve the murder of Cassidy Towne, a gossip columnist who has more than her fair share of enemies for her barbed attacks.  With Rook's help, they find out that Towne was writing a book exposing the truth behind the death of a celebrity who was thought to have died from a drug overdose.  The crime scene indicates that someone would prefer that the book not be written, and they're willing to kill anyone to make sure it never sees the light of day.<br /><br />Naked Head ended up being more entertaining and solid than I expected (though I didn't expect much), and it was good for a few hours of escape reading before falling asleep.  It's interesting that it's not known who actually writes the novels as \\"Richard Castle\\", but whoever it is does a pretty good job.  I'll definitely read the other two that are out as soon as I work my way up on the hold lists at the library.  So long as you go in with the proper expectations, the Heat series is worth the reading time for Castle fans.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedon the hold lists at the library.

B002VECM6S|5.0|We went to see The Blind Side on a date-night and just loved it. My husband especially wanted to own it on DVD. This is one of his most favorite movies.  Wonderful, Heartwarming, Endearing, Encouraging and Inspirational!  Based on a true recent story about Michael Oher:  How he was embraced and rescued out of a life of homelessness and grief (by the Tuohy family).  How he was challenged to achieve his full potential.  How he added a deeper dimension to their already rich & full lives, gave their lives greater meaning with the essence of who he is as he touched their hearts.  ... and so much more.  I came away with deep desire to meet this amazing young man - not for what he's accomplished in the spotlight, but for the wonderful person that he is.  I just love the Tuohy family for how they stood up for and protected him, for all they did for him, how they with love & respect reached out to his momma and that he's also their son now :)
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I finished this book last night - I wish it had been a bit longer but it certainly did have an impact.  The book was no doubt affected by Steve Job's illness or Mr Isaacson fell for some of Steve Job's charm. Possibly a bit of both. I think WI could have been a bit harsher on how SJ had treated many people over the years.I know SJ achieved a lot but it goes back to the age old argument/philosophy of what is success? Making billions of dollars, great products or treating those you meet with a bit of respect? Each to their own I suppose. I do fear that senior manager's will read this and think that it is ok to treat people poorly to achieve their \\"vision\\". Just remember: SJ died at 56 after going through years of excrutiating pain. Some might say that Kharma can be pretty ruthless too.  That's it - a very worthwhile read although I'm not sure about the hefty price tag. I'd prefer to have a hardback for that price. Such is the sacrifice we make for the convenience of the Kindle :)  Enjoy.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|...blurbs on SF book covers which compare the book to Tolkein's LOTR. However in this case, wonder of wonders! the comparison is deserved. I have been a passionate reader of SF since around 1953, age 8; I have read LOTR maybe 20 times; and I can offer no higher praise--except maybe to say that Erikson may even have surpassed the Master.   The series (The Malazan Book of the Fallen) is immensely complex; it wasn't until the third reading through that things really started to fall into place. I love that! And the depth of the time perspective rivals that of Tolkein; this gives that feeling that this could be real, it has such a detailed backdrop full of implicit unknowns. Erikson's background as an anthropologist serves him extremely well in his convincing portrayals of lost cultures, strange peoples, and layered history.  I think it stunning that, at this stage of the development of SF, someone could come up with a new and original treatment of magic; but Erikson does so! And his profound treatment of the military (central to the book) makes me wonder if he or a close relative of his has served.  It is a dark work, no question of that. The first time a major character died, I could not believe it; I kept waiting for him to be magically resurrected. But somehow despite the darkness it is not depressing; perhaps this is due to the poignant flashes of nobility and goodness, as well as the episodes of comic relief which have a subtle, British-style humor I find utterly compelling (full disclosure: I am British).  I find the series astonishingly well written. I am by no means a connoisseur of literature, but to my ear he doesn't put a word wrong. I actually remember, in the 6th book, running across a phrase I thought was awkward, and realizing this was the first time that had happened!  The only negative thing I could say is that, as I approach the end of my third read-through, I anticipate being left vainly searching for a new read that could rival this masterpiece.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|I love Rio.  It is a wonderful movie both kids and adults can enjoy.  I love the story, the colors and the environment and was laughing through out the entire movie.  The voices are paired up very nicely with the characters.  You can't beat George Lopez as the Tucan.  p.s.  My friend got the chance to work on this movie at Blue Sky Studios and he is a brilliant artist.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|I enjoyed the movie...it wasn't the best, but it was enjoyable.  However, this review is really about the scam that is \\"UltraViolet\\" digital copy.  While the ability to stream a movie to multiple devices is great, it does NOT allow you to watch the movie when you do not have internet access - like on a plane.  The benefit of the iTunes digital copy is that you can transfer the file to a portable device and watch it anywhere - at any time.  Not so with the UltraViolet version.  In order to watch that version, you must have internet access because it is merely streaming it to your portable device.  I typically pay extra money for a \\"combo pack\\" (blu ray/dvd/digital copy) because it allows me to watch the movie anywhere - even if that place does NOT have a blu ray player - such as in a car.  While this version contains a DVD which is playable in my car, the digital copy is not as beneficial as the typical iTunes version.  Had I known this, I would have purchased a different version of the movie...or maybe not at all.  Very disappointing.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I really liked this movie.  This being the first animated cartoon ILM did, the crew did a fantastic job.  I like the sense of realism that was used in this movie along with the amazing looking environment.  The humor and acting  for Rango was just hilarious.  Great for kids and grown up and a great way to brings family or friends together.  I had a chance to listen and watch the behind the scenes to this movie when the animation director for this movie came to our school and talked about it.   I definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it and if you have seen it, watch it again.
B00003CXC7|5.0|When I forced this movie on a group of 20-somethings for our weekly movie night years ago, everyone complained. Who wanted to see an old, boring movie from the 1950's? It wasn't long, though, before everyone was on the edge of their seats, shouting for Grace Kelly to hurry up before she got caught. Grace Kelly, by the way, has never been lovelier than she is in this film. One reviewer on Amazon complained about the slow pace of the movie. It's called character development, something newer filmmakers should learn more about, and younger viewers should learn to appreciate.
B005G4TJUC|1.0|As another reviewer wrote, I watched this partly out of morbid curiosity (while trapped on an 8-hour trans-Atlantic flight): How low could Michael Bay go?  Or could he somehow redeem the embarrassment that was \\"Revenge of the Fallen\\" and re-capture the excitement and solid sci-fi/action spirit of the first movie?  Well, the answer is no.  At the risk of repeating other disappointed reviewers, \\"Dark of the Moon\\" is an utterly lazy, mind-numbingly stupid re-hash of cliches, offensive potty humor, and implausible \\"action\\" scenes that insult the intelligence even of fans willing to go to great lengths to suspend disbelief for the sake of this movie (a dozen mostly-retired soldiers with 21st century firearms and 6-8 Autobots wipe out hundreds (or thousands...it's not really clear since they position themselves around the whole planet) of Decepticons armed with futuristic lasers??  The idiocy just goes on and on and on.  More pointless blather from Sam's parents; more offensive sterotypes in the form of bit-part Autobots; lots of blurry action that is so close-up you can't even tell what's happening.  It's as if Michael Bay decided since he did a decent job the first time, there was no need wasting good animation on the point of the WHOLE FRANCHISE: robots that \\"Transform\\" into vehicles!  The first film actually put some effort into depicting these scenes in CG.  In Dark of the Moon, the machines just pop in-and-out of vehicle or robot mode so fast you hardly notice.  Short story way too long: while I really enjoyed the first Transformers movie, Dark of the Moon is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.
B00009NHC5|5.0|The slow building of suspense is masterful, and the scene where Susie realizes she's been conned is thrilling, but when she discovers she is trapped and screams in anguish behind the bars on her railing, it is downright agonizing to watch. Susie's intellect and resourcefulness are captivating. The only down side to the film is husband Sam's patronizing attitude at the end. It's a minor flaw in an otherwise exquisite movie.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|This picks up about where Viva La Vida left off, except this time around the songs are more layered, dense, and grandiose. One thing about Mylo is that it isn't nearly as easy to get into as their previous efforts.  But be patient and give it a few listens.  It took me about 4 times all the way through before it connected with me.
0060730552|4.0|It was an inspiring read about triumphing over adversity.  People who challenge nature and thrive on it are a mystery to me but it makes for a good escape read.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I was 12 in 1983.<br /><br />I can only imagine what how someone in who was 12 in 2001 on 9/11 feels.<br /><br />This film coupled with the extraordinary film Testament with Jane Alexander pulls together the feeling of potential fear and doom of the Reagan years. The impact of this film cannot be understated and cannot be completely understood in todays media world where there are so many tv channels not to mention the internet, video games etc. In '83 network TV was still king. The film was watched and widely discussed and I think actually made a difference on how America perceived the possibility of nuclear war. Fo anyone not alive during that period the film is a special time capsule. The only other television even that I think caused as much discussion and contemplation in the the US population was Roots. I might be overstating it... but this film had an impact!  I really wish that Testament was not so expensive as I think both need to be seen to be full appreciated. The Day After is the big hollywood picture, the graphic horror of nuclear war. Testament is the quiet version, perhaps even more terrifying as it is the intimate depiction of what an event like that would do to one family.<br /><br />If this topic appeals to you on any level. Try and see both.

B001B1UO6W|5.0|I remember when this movie came out my cousins bought it. My brother was entering school that year. He watched Child's Play and had nightmares of Chucky. Later on down the line my little cousin, who was the same age as my brother, bought the Chuky doll. My brother wouldn't walk in the house till he new the doll was put away. My brother is now in his 20's. My husband and I bought him the Chucky doll for Christmas last year.... Man you should have seen his face, lol.<br /><br />This is a good scary movie. If you haven't seen it it is a must see.

1439102813|5.0|I was looking forward to reading this book, some of my friends were not.  The author tells the story of her character's progression into Alzheimers in such a manner that it is extremely easy to comprehend. We all forget little things - where is my cell phone, where are my keys, but when the forgetfulness elevates to extremes, it is time to talk to your family or your primary care physician.  There is no cure, but some new drugs are on the way, and hope and love from the family is extremely important to the person with the disease.  I did not care for the protagonist's husband at all.  He was a very selfish person in my opinion and wanted to push Alice into trying some experimental drugs which he was working on.  Alice was still strong enough to tell him that she could still think for herself, and I loved that she did that.    I do believe that Alice tried way to hard to guide her daughter away from acting and to go to college.  Perhaps Alice was right to do that but you cannot or should not try to run your children's lives even though you only want the best for them.  It worked itself out for the best. Alice's children had their own lives and didn't want any illness disturbing what they had on their calendars.  Their main concern, will I get this?  They were tested and one daughter does carry the gene.  Her life turns out fine with bumps along the way.    Not knowing where you are, getting lost a block from home, not familiar with own your home, i.e., where is the bathroom takes so much out of the Alzheimer's person, but Alice was strong and did the best she could. Her husband became irritated with her and tired of taking care of her. I believe this is very common.  I was thrilled that she did not go with him to New York.  He was a very self-centered person and Alice needed care and her children and friends stepped in.  I like this book very much.  It did not make me sad, it gave me information.
B000PY52EU|5.0|I love this movie! Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson are great in this movie.  The music is blues and great to listen to as well as goes along with the movie great! Worth the purchase and we watch it all the time.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|It's Beyonce on stage. 'Nuff said! She's the queen.   I can't wait to enjoy this DVD! I LOVE the album \\"4\\"   and so i can't wait to see the live performances of   the new songs
1439152799|5.0|After reading, and loving, The House at Riverton, I decided to read all of Kate Morton's tales. This is my second one and it was not a disappointment. She catches you right in the beginning with a mysterious letter and her mother's odd reaction to it. From there, it doesn't stop. There is a castle involved, full of strange sounds and lots of storms. It's a wonderful, haunting story, mysterious and enchanting.  The Distant Hours is written with the same skills as The House at Riverton. Her character development is marvelous and her descriptive language captivates you and doesn't let go.  I loved it and have added Kate Morton to my list of favorite authors.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I don't know why more opeople didn't pick up this movie.  I enjoyed the movie.  I think Rachel and Keanu did a great job, and So did Gabriel.  This product was ordered by amazon, an it came in a group of 3, quickly and it was received in great shape.
B002VPEAOE|5.0|I fully expected to find this book only mildly entertaining, at best. I had it on a list for quite awhile before I finally picked it up and actually started reading it. Surprise, surprise. As soon as I began reading, I found myself completely captivated. It also has more depth than I expected it to. The House at Riverton has a little something for everyone.  I love Kate Morton's writing style. There were a number of times, while reading this book, that I felt like I was looking at something that had been written by Wilkie Collins. There's just something about her style that made his writings come to my mind. That is a compliment to the author, as Wilkie Collins is one of my favorites.  If you, like me, have had this book on a list to read and just haven't gotten around to it, do yourself a favor. Pick it up, start reading. You won't stop.
B0059R5Q08|1.0|If you've never read the book, you might find this tolerable: wooden, ridiculous, awful. The acting was poor; the characters bore little resemblance to the characters in the book; important dialogue and scenes were cut or altered. Yeesh. Couldn't bare to watch more than a few minutes of each scene and then eventually just stopped. Waste of $3.99; waste of time.  I agree with the individual who wanted to give it negative stars.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I've liked the movie Carrie ever since I was a kid and now that I'm older I feel that I can truly appreciate it for the horror classic that it is. The movie follows a young misfit by the name of Carrie White, who's constantly tormented by her peers. All she really wants to do is fit in, but her goal is seemingly an impossible one to reach because of her abusive mother and cruel schoolmates. The film is fantastic in my opinion and I think any one who views it will love it and start to sympathize with the title character.
B005UT29Z0|1.0|Don't waste your time or money. Very slow, predictable and boring.  It is rated R because every fourth line uses the \\"f\\" word.  Otherwise it would be rated G.  There is no sex, violence or action.  A yarn aimed at beating up on Wall Street with a few big name actors. The one star was for the acting.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Good play.  Engage your brain a bit rather than just shooting things.  Love thatyou only get hints every 12 hours!
B005IS565S|5.0|I admit that I was not a fan of FFDP. I've heard bits and pieces of their first two offerings and wasn't impressed and did not buy either one. American Capitalist ,however, has to be in the discussion for album of the year. I am so impressed with Ivan Moody. He sounds like Corey Taylor at times but his voice changes into 4 different distinct variations where it almost sounds like someone else is doing the singing. Really really love his voice. His range and tone are perfect on this album. Jeremy Spencer has definitely gotten my attention on drums. This guy is a beast. Great leads from Zoltan Bathory on guitar and the bass drive on this album is blow your face off cool. The first song American Capitalist blows your face off and has a Slipknot feel to it as much of the album does. I immediately loved both it and the second song Over and Under It which would make Rob Zombie proud and made me think of some of Zombie's earlier songs. Heavy Metal groove dance music. The Pride is catchy but took me a few listens to start liking. Coming Down is now one of my favorites but I admit I did not care for it the first couple of times through. Menace and Generation Dead have also grown on me. Back For More was an immediate favorite for me from my first listen on. Very fast paced and melodic while still blowing your face off. Out of the last 4 songs I only like If I Fall and have started skipping the others. 4 great songs and 4 more that are really good means this is a great album. From what I heard of the previous stuff this seems like a huge leap forward to me and I now want to see these guys live. I will also look forward to seeing what they have is store for us. This is a must have for Heavy Metal and hard rock fans alike.
0882709194|1.0|the book is the original, so it is fine. But the introduction is purely Christian propaganda. It talks about how creationism is obviously correct. It also mocks Darwin calling him a prejudice. I would advise you to buy the original version of this book.
B005JU5JTI|1.0|Bad plot, tiring to watch main charactor betray everyone and everything.  Halfway though the movie we switched it off, we truly wasted out money.

B005NJ2K6U|5.0|To be honest, I was never into these matching games. However, I had a lot of fun with this! I guess because it requires a bit more intelligence. You could swap certain gems, move a block of gems from one area to another, and if enough room, spin those blocks so gems are in different spots. To get a lot of stars aka points and match until you run out of matches is pretty simply, but to actually match every gem (optional in a way) requires intense planning! I also love that there is a casual mode where there are same puzzles but no timer (which I hate) and unlimited hints. It is a fun game when you got nothing better to do!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|wonderful<br />I enjoyed reading it. it is a must. I couldn't put my kindle down. The stories are great
B000Y11BAS|5.0|I believe this is an absolutely wonderful movie.  At times, though, a very sad movie.  Both Madonna and Antonio Banderas have excellent performances.  I never get tired of watching this movie.
B004ZJADNQ|5.0|I have most of the Thin Lizzy catalog in my collection. But they just never sounded that good on cd to me. I have them but they were just missing something that made me say \\" Wow\\" This remaster has that. It's better in every way compared to the original Vertigo cd's that I already had. So kudos to the production team who created this remaster and hopefully the whole catalog would follow. I'm ready to turn over my Thin Lizzy catalog into something great. So keep them coming and I surely will buy them.
B00005QCVY|5.0|I like to watch this movie at least one time every holiday season.  There for a while this movie was shown so many times that I grew to dislike it for a period of time.  Now days I believe this movie is shown only one time a season.  I can enjoy it again.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am pretty sure that this is the Joan Rivers of Star Wars releases. There has been so much tweaking and pasting that you are left wondering if the films were ever any good. Why do they keep trying to \\"fix\\" them?  How much more nip/tucking can they do until the films are unrecognizable.  If you can resist the extra features, do not buy this set.  Lucas needs to release the original movies like we all want. That I would pay for. Not this. Lame! I feel so sorry for the generation who will only have this to watch and never saw the groundbreaking original releases. If this version was the one I had seen originally, I would not be a Star Wars fan.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I purchased for another individual who recently informed me, when I inquired, that he has yet to use sharpener.  I do hope it is a good product because I am considering purchasing one of these sharpeners for myself since I now own a \\"Buck\\" pocket knife.
0698116496|5.0|My mother-in-law bought the board book edition of \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\" several weeks ago for our son (now 16 months old).  He instantly loved everything about this book. In addition to liking a straight reading of the book, he likes turning it into a finding game (certain things, like a banana, a red balloon, and the moon, appear on most--if not all--pages).  He picked up a couple new words from his love of reading this book.  I'd never heard of this book before we received it and it will definitely be a go-to gift idea.
6305212112|5.0|This movie has an excellent story line backed up by some actor performances that cannot be duplicated.  I still enjoy seeing this movie every now and again.  Jessica Tandy is just memorial for her acting in this movie.
0062101897|5.0|I was worried about spending so much money on a single book, but it is worth every single penny. It helps that Amazon is running a special deal at the moment, although I would still pay the full price for it. Not only was it larger than I thought, but the 500+ pages were made with such quality and creativity. It goes through each of the films, which brought a better insight to what it actually takes to make a great movie. The art department certainly brought J.K. Rowling's novels to the big screen. My favorite parts of the book are the in depth descriptions of the characters, creatures, and sets throughtout all of the films. It is like an encyclopedia of the Harry Potter world. I'd also like to note that this product is not merely a picture book. It has great stories and description throughout the book that includes insight from the directors, producers, actors, JK Rowling, and many other people who made these films possible. All true Harry Potter fans of the books or films will have to have this as part of their collection!! It is absolutely WONDERFUL!
B00009Y3L4|5.0|There are good performances throughout the entire show.  This movie is great only because of the actors. The era it covers is one that should never have happened.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Hollywood may be irreligious and non-religious, but irreligious and non-religious people think about death too, and it's interesting to see their take on it.  I can't think of a single film that been a failure in exploring the undiscovered country.  \\"Ghost\\" was incredibly good, and even a movie like \\"Flatliners\\" was worth the price of admission.  I would put this one somewhere in between those two.  As far as the movie itself, it was well written and well directed, believably acted and of solid quality.<br /><br />I do wish that we had a chance to listen to George's letter to Marie at the end of the movie.  My viewing companion and I agree that it included something along the lines of: SPOILER ALERT \\"The girl you tried to hold on to and save wanted to say thank you.\\"  But that is something only Peter Morgan would be able to confirm.
B0000714BP|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing these three main characters (men) dress and perform as female impersonators throughout the movie/musical.  The acting was not all that great but I still watch it from time to time.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|This was a good book, but given what came before, disappointing. I can't help but compare this culmination to the last of JK Rowling's Harry Potter books. Rowling was amazing at plotting--all the pieces came together. But I keep thinking Ms. Moning wrote herself into some corners. SPOILERS! We wait for the resolution of the Lord Master--and he just gets killed off? And what's with the \\"I thought I was bipolar since high school?\\" Never came up before. I think overall the entire series is a great accomplishment, but the last was not the best.
0439023521|5.0|A student handed me this box set at the beginning of class one night, promising a great read. She's 18. Uh oh! Now I have to read it no matter how I feel about the first 50 pages. The book cover made me nervous. However, in no time at all I realized I was reading one of the most fantastic books about a fabricated world I'd ever read. I was as fascinated by the first in this series as I was when I read The Hobbit or Dune @13.<br /><br />For mature readers who doubt their ability to be swept away by brave new world fiction of the 21st century, fear not. This is a rejuvenating gem - far FAR superior to most of the dated future world fiction of the 20th century I've forced down. The author truly can write and she rarely calls upon you to abandon logic.<br /><br />There are thousands of extensive reviews of this book. All I feel I can uniquely add is the mature endorsement of a well educated cynic. I give this book an uninhibited 5 stars.

0698116496|4.0|A lovely full of details picture book that allows the reader to make up the words and tell the story. My 19-mth-old daughter loves the cheeky gorilla, the secret-y walk into the zookeeper's home and the wife's surprised eyes in the darkness. It has been a great way to remind her to sleep in her own bed/cot just like the animals. We can't get enough of the details that we discover at each read. A joyous book to share.
B001MSMULG|1.0|Can Amazon explain why you can buy the book for 7 dollars with the added expense of printed pages, while digitally with very low overhead it is $10?  I like my kindle but will continue to frequent local bookstores unless Amazon can be more reasonable in their pricing of older books.
141694737X|4.0|The little rhyme and flaps make this book enjoyable. It seems like a simple book at first glance, but there's just so much to do - lift the flaps, learn the name of the names, listen to the rhyme, make animal noises. Perfect for car rides for the board book means that little ones can turn the pages without ripping them off. Perfect book to take to an outing to the zoo, too. Thanks, we're going to write our own little little to the zoo soon.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Love this show. Been waiting all year for it to come out on dvd. Like the story line, and the back and forth of the winchester brothers' relationship.  It's not always clear who is the moral compass, but their support for each other keeps them moving forward.  I could go on and on, but I won't.  I really enjoy this series, good entertainment and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the paranormal or the \\"boogeyman\\".
0142403873|5.0|What an adorable book with lovely rhyme and imaginative story telling. My little girl adores the book and we read it at bedtime! No frightening monsters for her. Plenty of opportunities for making up voices, action play and activities with this gorgeous book. We've just started on the Gruffalo's child and it has become another favourite. No wonder it has been a favourite for many a kid over the years. Thanks for a wonderful book to share each day, countless times.

B000021XS0|4.0|So far this and the original Operation Mindcrime/Queensryche, are the 2 best concept albums.  This album sees the debut of Jordan on keyboards, uh a decision at least I, as a fan regret.  But on here he doesn't do a bad job.  The band sounds great, nice production.  The vocals are solid.  The music is played very well with only a few moments where it feels like they run on too long.  The story, according to wikipedia, is quite depressing.  Strange Deja Vu 9/10 Nice rocker to sort of open the album, after a couple of mini tracks.  James has some interesting melodies in the chorus.  Nice guitaring by John, what else would you expect?  The first verse or so is kind of mid tempo, but after the first chorus the song changes quite a bit, becoming more up tempo.    Fatal Tragedy 9/10 mixed with a short mini track, that should've just been part of this song.  I really don't understand them splitting this one up, but whatever, for my purposes I'm reviewing these as 1 track.  The song starts with a beautiful piano verse with James putting down some nice vocals.  Can't believe I'm complimenting Jordan's playing, but on this album he didn't bother me.  The song shortly after becomes heavier, still the piano is very up front in the mix along with the guitars.  Mike really needs to stop adding his crappy vocals onto these songs.  Granted he's now out of the band, so that won't be a problem.  Nice chorus otherwise.  The instrumental runs on a little too long, for what it is, but I'm nit picking.  Beyond This Life 8/10 starts off with probably the heaviest part on the album, before becoming softer for the first verse.  The song gets heavier as it builds towards a chorus.  This song shifts quite a bit between heavy and soft, but not in a predictable way like most bands, when they do that.  Overall this is a pretty good song.  Through Her Eyes 9/10 doesn't top Space Di Vest, but damn if it doesn't try.  This is possibly my second favorite Dream Theater ballad, at least to this magnitude of softness.  I kind of think of Misunderstood amongst others as a bit of a ballad too, and I love that song too, but this is definitely up there amongst their best soft songs.  The song opens with a woman doing some vocals, before piano and eventually some acoustic guitars, and nice vocals by James.  There really isn't a chorus that brings this one all together, granted it's very good without one, but if it had a really good one, I'd have given it a perfect score.  Still more than a passing grade for this gem.  Home 9/10 is a really long song, which takes a while to build, as the intro goes, eventually the actual song starts.  It's a very nice song though.  The intro is pretty cool, mix of symbols, acoustic guitars and what sounds like a sitar or something, before the drums kick in, as it slowly builds up to the actual song.  Love the opening riff, well when the song kicks in full swing.  This is probably the heaviest verse on the album, another great riff too.  James does his usual solid job, Mike, again, needs to stop adding his crappy excuse for vocals.  james can handle things just fine.  The chorus, takes a while to get there, cause there's a lot of great build up to it, but it's awesome.  This is easily my favorite song on the album, although there are a bunch of really good ones to choose from.  This is also the last heavier song, the rest being relatively soft.  A side note, I use to have this song on a mix tape right next to Queensryche's Falling down, and it was amazing to see how much Dream Theater made Queensryche their b---hes.  Man those guys suck now.  One Last Time 8/10 would get an 8 if they didn't take out the second chorus and place it in Finally Free.  I seriously don't understand that one, but whatever.  This song starts with drums and piano.  I'm not really a fan of the piano playing in this one, but it's not so bad that it ruins the song.  Not much guitars.  The solo's short, but nice.  The song seems to end just as it gets going, rare complaint for a Dream Theater song, for me at least.    The Spirit Carries On 7/10 ok I'm getting sick of piano now.  Granted it's played much better in this one, compared to the last song.  The first verse and chorus are vocals and piano, some acoustic guitars come in after the first chorus.  Overall this is a nice song, would've made a peaceful way to end the album, but...  Anyways  Finally Free 9/10 ends up being kind of a dramatic way to end the album.  I don't really know how to describe this ong.  There's a sense of urgency to it.  It starts with some acoustic guitars, before some string instruments kick i, then piano and vocals.  Eventually the rest of the band kicks in.  The lyrics in the second verse could've been better, but whatever.  Love the chorus.  For some reason the chorus to One Last Time is put in here.    Overall what else can I say about this album?  This is a definite must own for any Dream Theater fan.  If you're new to the band, this should definitely be on your list of first few albums to get, I'd recommend Images and words and Awake first, but you can't go wrong with this one either.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|First of all, I would NEVER pay $2.99 for this.. ..or anything actually......that's why I'm so thankful for Amazon's FAOTD.<br />IF This was free than it might not be too bad, otherwise its probably better suited for a toddler. I like other games like bejeweled &amp; stuff. not so much this.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  I really like having the physical cd and the cost delta is a small increase over downloading in electronic format.   I think this is a under appreciated yes album.  If you are new to yes you may have to listen to it twice to really get in to it, but then it will become one of your favorites.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|Most people just don't get it. They see this movie as pornographic filth. The truth is that Bob Gucionne wanted to create a film that actually depicted the depravity of the roman empire, and he accomplished his goal. Because of our dogmatic views of our aversion to  the porn industry, we have completely overlooked the directors original artistic vision. Caligula unrated is a masterpiece worthy of the ranks of Citizen Kane, and The Godfather. This movie is incredibly well done. Peter O' Toole delivers an epic portrayal of Emperor Tiberius. Malcom McDowell is great as Caligula. Ann Savoy and Helen Mirren round off this steller cast, and deliver performances that are nothing short of acting at its finest. Yes, I know it contains fifty minutes of x-rated content, but why watch part of a movie, when you can watch the entire masterpiece today. Watch this film as it was intended buy Caligula today, and see film that his stil ahead of its time in regards to society social standards.

0385738773|2.0|The more I read dystopian/speculative fiction, the more I realize just how difficult a genre it is.  Everything has to be placed so perfectly, all plot twists in a nice, neat line.  There has to be a great deal of logic to the world that is created and, when the final chapter is closed, all must be revealed or the author runs the risk of leaving the reader confused.  Unfortunately, as I finished the last word of this book, my first thought was, \\"Huh?\\"  Spoilers will follow, so don't read any further if you don't want to know any of the details.  When I read The Maze Runner, I thought it was a really innovative, creepy idea.  It was interesting to speculate about who had thrown the boys and Teresa in the maze and why they were there.  The small details that were doled out really helped this atmosphere.  When I read The Scorch Trials, though, I felt like things started to fall apart a bit.  There was still so little known, so little that made sense.  And now, with The Death Cure, I can't help but feel unsatisfied with the story overall.  There is still so much of it that I don't understand.  As I read the book, I realized that a few things should have been happening: for one, more information should have been doled out over the course of the series.  I didn't want Dashner to give everything away in the first book, but there should have been more flashes of memory on Thomas's part, particularly after he went through the Changing.  This would have helped solidify details about the world, which would have gone a very long way toward making the events of The Death Cure make sense.  The biggest problem I had with The Death Cure was that it felt to me like Thomas was just flailing along the entire novel, with one instance of sheer dumb luck after another.  The world was like a blur, and it was hard to figure out exactly what was going on.  I had the sense that Dashner was rolling out setting after setting to show the reader, \\"See, this is what the world is like!\\"  This would have been fine, had there been an actual purpose to each setting, but it felt more to me like I was being taken on a tour of the world, rather than watching the plot unfold.  I strongly feel that there should have been a plan, that Thomas's actions should have had a more deliberate course of action.  I just can't buy that he somehow manages to bumble around and, ultimately, is successful.  I guess you could say that WICKED orchestrated this, but that just doesn't feel right to me.  There were too many variables (yes, I know how much WICKED loves those) for there to be any reasonable expectation that things would play out the way they did.  The other major flaw, to me, lay in the fact that Thomas decided not to get his memory back.  While I understood his reasoning, and could buy it, I think it did the novel a real disservice.  Had Thomas regained his memory, and had the reader been given a window through which to view the gradual decline and collapse of the world, WICKED's motivations would have made more sense.  As it is, I really feel that their motivations made little sense at all.  Yes, they said they were trying to find a cure for the Flare.  But that doesn't answer the question of why they had to set up such elaborate, physical experiments as part of their research.  While one of the characters does explicitly state that WICKED was out of control, using up what few resources remained in their mad pursuit for a cure rather than trying to preserve what was left of the population, I felt that there was still just no good explanation for what they had done.  Why couldn't they have simply hooked Thomas and his friends up to machine, induced hallucinations, and measured their brain activity that way?  Why did they have to drop them into a maze to get the information they wanted?  Thomas's choice not to regain his memory also had a very adverse affect on Teresa as a character.  She just does too many 180 degree turns to really be believable.  I liked her so much inthe first book, considerably less in the second, and was completely disappointed in her in the third.  She becomes nothing more than a plot device, really.  Her moment of redemption in sacrificing herself to save Thomas just fell flat because, by that point, she was such an enigma.  Had Thomas regained his memories and had the reader been given more insight into what drove Teresa to become what she did, she'd have been more of a well-rounded character.  Lastly, I just couldn't get behind the idea of Jorge and Brenda, and the fact that they had been inserted from day one solely to achieve the ends desired by the Chancellor.  Thomas trusts them much too quickly, and his friends acquiesce much too easily, even though they never cease to be suspicious of Brenda in particular.    The ultimate revelation also just didn't make sense to me.  Exactly why was the Flare released?  The Chancellor says that it was meant as a means of controlling the population, but there's no explanation of why the population needed to be controlled after the solar flares.  If an author is going to drop a bomb like this, the reader should have a sense that everything is coming together, a sense that I felt was entirely lacking.  I'm really disappointed by the ending of this series, which is a shame because it was off to such an intriguing start.
B0059R5Q08|2.0|I was excited to see this- it had some great reviews and Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books.  This was a letdown.  Perhaps a viewer who has not read the book would enjoy it, but I could not get into this adaptation.  Thank goodness for Judi Dench, who was this movie's only saving grace.
0553801473|3.0|Just finished this - was looking for something to read and happened upon this series this summer.  Started wonderfully well, but alas I can't fully recommend this series.  I like what Martin does with his series, some characters actually die in it.  But to some extent it seems by this point the best characters have been killed off.  This latest book I had a hard time getting through.  The writing is top notch - as with all the previous books, however I just don't care for many of the characters.  I liked many of the earlier ones, but they ended up dead at some point or another.  While it is rather unique to have some primary characters die - quite a few of them over the last few books, you eventually get to a point where you don't wish to commit too much to any particular character because they will soon get bumped off.  While Jordan does the opposite - all the main characters are still alive after book eleven, and they are bone tired by then, this is the other extreme.  Many of the good guys die, and your left with bumbling children and vile queen regents that you wish would end up like  many of the previous characters.  Good book, good series, but could have been great if Martin would have picked some different characters to behead, poison, drown, etc. etc. etc.
0393035158|1.0|Anyone looking for a rational, positive, Humanistic critique of organized religion will be sorely disappointed by this book. \\"The End of Faith\\" is a paranoid, alarmist rant that exemplifies all the worst characteristics of the dogmatism it claims to be critiquing. Sam Harris plays perfectly into the stereotype of the atheist who can only define his beliefs negatively in relation to those of someone else. His broad generalizations and vague use of terms result in numerous contradictions. He attacks religion for its apparent intolerance but explicitly denounces tolerance himself. He denounces religions for starting wars but makes it clear that he supports the War on Terror AS a war on Islam. In some chapters, right intentions make right morality, while in others, good intentions count for nothing if the result is bad.   The extremely muddled nature of his moral categories becomes apparent in his defense of torture (yes, he defends torture!). In equating torture with \\"collateral damage,\\" he completely ignores the fact that real collateral damage is at least as inevitable as war itself, whereas there's nothing inevitable about torture (unless of course, one regards human cruelty as totally inevitable), as well as ignoring the distinction between killing and the infliction of pain. He justifies his muddled morality with equally muddled math. In presenting the \\"ticking bomb\\" scenario, he argues (pg. 198) that \\"if there is even one chance in a million that [a captured terrorist] will tell us something under torture that will lead to the further dismantling of Al Qaeda, it seems we should use every means at our disposal to get him talking.\\" If Mr. Harris had taken a moment to actually ponder the mathematical import of his own words, rather than indulge in the same revenge-fantasies he roundly condemns only 40 pages earlier in a discussion about drug legalization and the death penalty (pgs. 158-164), he would have realized that a one-in-a-million chance of getting accurate information from torture means that for every one piece of good data you (hypothetically) get from torturing a prisoner, you will get 999,999 pieces of bad data! The prisoner may very well reveal that the bomb is in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Paris, Green Acres, Mars, Narnia, or Middle Earth before he reveals its true location, by which time it will have already gone off. Perhaps if Mr. Harris had been more willing to think through the \\"ticking-bomb\\" scenario a bit more carefully, he would not have been so glib in his dismissal of the fact that torture yields unreliable testimony. By a similar mangling of the laws of probability, Harris manages to convince himself that because 19 Muslim hijackers were willing to blow themselves up to destroy the World Trade Center, the rest of the world's billion-or-so Muslims who haven't reduced themselves to a pile of smoldering ash in the name of Allah must nevertheless be suicidal terrorists as well. His tendency to frame things in an us-versus-them way and generalize about the behavior of very large and broadly-defined groups based on the behavior of a few is a perfect example of the kind of tribalist thinking he hypocritically denounces throughout the book.  The past three centuries since the Enlightenment have seen the writing of such eloquent critiques of religion and the religious mindset as Voltaire's \\"Candide,\\" Thomas Paine's \\"Common Sense,\\" Edward Gibbon's \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" David Hume's \\"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\\" and \\"The Natural History of Religion,\\" and Ambrose Bierce's \\"The Devil's Dictionary.\\" If there is any sort of life after death, they are surely rolling in their graves.
007174889X|5.0|I just got these books.  I've read the first 200 pages, these are extremely informative, clearly and concisely written, beautifully and tactfully laid out.  They have hundreds of photos and diagrams.  I am far more pleased with these than I ever expected to be!  How much information man has acquired!  It is astounding.
B004Y1USJE|1.0|In any case, the album is superior than the live band, I saw them with STYX at Jones' Beach nearby NYC, and they were so bad, pathetically so bad, and it is one of my all time favorite prog bands. STYX were 100 times superior. Unbelievable, and if they do not make another great album with JON ANDERSON before they completely retire, it will not look so good for them in the rock history books. I am sorry, this is BAD, the guy cannot sing. This record is a manipulation by the producer who actually makes much more money on this record than the rest of the band, re-using his songs that were refused by the Drama Yes period. At the end, whatever amount of money they sell, the producer will make tons of money from producing the record and from the publishing generated by the sale of the album, while the band will be blamed for doing an uninspiring bad record. I would rather follow up now the solo career of Ian Anderson.
B005ELQVGW|4.0|'Biophilia' is not an easy listen, it's not something that is going to leap out and grab you the way 'Homogenic' did. This is a cd that you need to sit quietly, preferably with headphones, and listen to several times. After that, the appeal of it should come through for you. It's not background music. For some people, they don't want to put in the work to appreciate an artist's difficult work, and that's fine, but if you give it a chance, I think you'll find an excellent Bjork cd. It's light years better than the awful 'Volta' and 'Medulla'. No, it's not as good as 'Vespertine.' BUT, it's good, in my opinion, you just have to really let yourself hear it....
B002HNA95E|3.0|Another greatest hits of Madonna, no extra and nothing special about this collection. the song list is quit regular and obvious, like listening to the radio special Madonna program.
B005IY3CMQ|5.0|Noone, NOONE, is as creative as these guys, and I love this stuff. I realize it may be too \\"weird\\" for some ears. Considering that I also love Massive Attack, all I can say is that I really love English guys who go nuts in the studio. They seem to feel no need to deliver the usual chirpy, \\"positive\\" music or to have to \\"rock\\" everyone that so many bands strive toward in order to be \\"commercial.\\" I've heard all that before; Radiohead gives me an experience, something new and interesting. Sometimes it works, sometimes not, but my god is it interesting! And when they do connect, it's awesome (check out \\"Seperator\\" on Disc 2, it's spooky-wild). I don't think what they did to Codex worked, but many other tracks did. Codex needed no remix, it's a gorgeous, mind-bending track as is. As long as these guys are creating, I'm there with a pre-order.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|As I wrote about the CD: the song list is very obvious and nothing special about it. Some of the clips are bad quality video, no extras with this DVD.
B00080ZG10|5.0|It's hard to say how much of this movie is based on actual facts and how much was spiced up by Hollywood. Regardless, I enjoyed the movie and the special effects were great. I saw on television parts of how the movie was made. The house in the crash scene was a model and so was the plane. You would never know it by watching the movie. I recommend this movie.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|One of the best musical movies ever. the video quality is great and the sound is perfect.  A must have for all Beatles fans or great music fans...  The covers are excellent and enjoyable almost as listening to the original.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|the best of the series so far, a must have for any vin diesel fan. The rock in awesome in this one also.
B004LROMSO|5.0|King Arthur is young and pretty, but Camelot is a ruin, and Merlin isn't in such hot shape himself.  Honor and chivalry guide heroes' actions, but casual betrayals threaten Britain's very foundations.  Ceremonial pomp glorifies the great hall, but the kingdom is built of raw wood and drystone walls.  This vision of the Matter of Britain probably runs grittier than any ever filmed, while keeping closest to the classic literature.<br /><br />Like most cable TV dramas, this series uses the lack of censorship to deal frankly with life's many and varied aspects.  It doesn't flinch from sex, and bolsters high feelings with occasional coarse language.  But unlike, say, True Blood, which runs toward exhibitionism, this series crafts a careful balance between its edgy elements and a tautly paced drama.  Even when clothes fly off and groping turns feverish, I never felt dragged through the mud.<br /><br />And this also provides an interesting vision of fantasy as realpolitik.  Wily Merlin and his attempts to manipulate others to enact his visions made an interesting take on a character who has grown bland through overexposure.  Arthur's need to make alliances, and his tendency to break them by acting without thinking, reveal just how delicate much of the putatively chivalrous world depicted in fantasy fiction really is.<br /><br />This makes for a bracing take on a story audiences have seen before, taking it in adventurous new directions without letting us feel we've had the rug ripped out from under us.  Placing it side by side with the BBC's [[ASIN:B001LF347E Merlin]], or any of numerous other Arthur renditions through the years, this one stands up well.  This makes a good complement to the myth, and an intriguing addition to a canon that keeps on giving.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|This review is on the Blu-ray disc of T2, not really the film itself. As we all know, T2 is one of the greatest sequels of all time, as well as one of the greatest and most critically acclaimed action movies of all time - fantastically written story, wonderful acting, top notch effects (even over 20 years later!), and a good steady pacing all make T2 a classic that will live on for even more upcoming generations.   Finally we have the film on Blu-ray, and needless to say, out of ALL the versions that have already been released of the film in VHS, Laser Disc,and DVD formats, this SkyNet Edition is the one to own. It contains ALMOST everything all the other versions did, minus some things a previous THX certified 2-disc DVD edition did, at least of what is readily available on the disc itself. What do I mean? Well, even though Blu-ray can fit a lot more memory than DVD, there is simply TOO MUCH content from those older DVD editions that was able to fit on one Blu-ray disc. Therefore in order to get the fullest effect of ALL the other special features that were on the previous DVD versions (T2 3D making of, behind the scenes, etc), you will have to download them, hence you require a Wifi connection. There are more details but you'll just have to get the disc to find out, as I'm not a techy head hence do not really understand the details. Yet the film does have a plethora of content. I will also add that this version DOES have both versions of the film - theatrical and director's cut. There is a picture in picture and quiz and facts modes that can be set while watching the film, which the previous DVD versions did not have (because they couldn't, as only Blu-ray has the ability for various picture in picture while a film is playing). For this, I removed half a star, but it was not the only reason why, the rest has to do with the presentation itself.  T2 on Blu-ray really only looks and sounds as good as the TV you have it hooked up to. On a fairly recently released Samsung 42\\" plasma, the film is a good Blu-ray transfer, though could've used perhaps an extra coat of cleanup. For the most part, the film looks very clean; most blacks are deep, shadows are smooth and colors are a bit richer. Still, the way this film is glossed over for Blu-ray seems sort of \\"flat,\\" and that same cleaner look that most older movies have, only due to the fact that there is only so much you can do with such old prints. I mean, it's no Lord of the Rings or Tron Legacy BD, and obviously they did not go through the same trouble to make sure it looked as good. It's a basic Blu-ray gloss over; it looks good, but a couple of more days in the workshop could've made it look fantastic. You will still notice some portions of grain and some left over \\"pops\\" and elements of random distortion from the original film print. Again, this is practically always the case with older films; another film you would see this in is the Blu-ray version of The Neverending Story. A cleaner movie, yet a somewhat \\"flat\\" look.  Audio-wise, the movie sounds good, yet at times can be uneven. All sounds come out richer than before, yet depending on your television the movie can do the \\"low then loud then low\\" game, or the \\"flatter when louder sounds come off\\" game. In other words, on an older HD television, you may get the irritation of having to deal with low sounding dialogue and quieter moments, only to be shocked when an explosion or gunshot hits, then all of the sudden the volume will go full blast, causing you to play with the volume continuously throughout the movie. On a newer television you'll get the \\"let's make them hear EVERY sound\\" effect game. That is, when some louder portions come up you'll notice the overall \\"volume\\" of that specific sound will lower in order to keep even with the rest of the movie. Moreover, sounds that were once lower will be purposefully raised so that they'll be audible.   Examples of this are in the beginning when the Terminator first acquires his clothes, he leaves the bar and \\"Bad to the Bone\\" begins playing. The song itself is normally supposed to sound louder than the rest of the film, but you'll immediately notice it's weaker and flatter tone due to the sound mixing trying to keep even. It doesn't deter too much, but it's still noticeable. Another example is when John Connor and his friend are riding his motorbike to the mall. They're blasting the stereo and John enters the tunnel area. At one moment his friend chants \\"yeah!\\" to the music, and normally this sound is lower, because obviously the bike is going and the song is playing, so his voice wouldn't be able to speak above it too high. Still, due to the sound mixing and in the attempts to try and keep it all even, you will hear his \\"yeah!\\" louder to an almost awkward and unrealistic sense. I dunno, in my opinion, a well mixed film soundtrack should keep as close to the original release as possible, in all volume levels and tones, yet just be, you know, cleaner and crisper. May Blu-ray discs seem to come off in their sound mixing in the same way, and though it's nice to have even volume during the film, it becomes a little too apparent at times, taking away from its theatrical originality.   Due to these reasons I give it 4.5 stars out of 5. Yes it is the definitive version of T2 to own (and hopefully the last ever released), but these flaws still do exist.

B00008YJHC|2.0|The Pixies are a protest band. They want us to know they're not cool and they don't care. Which makes them cool.  Their music, whether commercial or not, is 'ok'; Garbled sounding alternative rock with touches of Hawaiian.   The gorgeous \\"Havalina\\", \\"Velouria\\" and the catchy \\"Stormy Weather\\" comprise the highlights.   While it's cool to say you're 'underground', (which doesn't really make sense does it? Perhaps mining was their day job), and perhaps it's cool to say you have half-baked, poorly mixed music, makes you 'anti-commercial', it doesn't necessarily mean you make great music.

0439023513|5.0|The conclusion of my Hunger Games series...excellent series and the book sent was as promised in pristine condition.  It arrived within a week (regular delivery).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hungar Games is one of those rare reads that allows you to forget yourself entirely and fully immerse yourself in the story. It took me a page or two to lock in to the POV but once I did I fell in love with the immediacy of Collin's prose. The story unfolds quickly and the reader is caught up in the whirlwind of the plot in much the same way that Katniss is; there were times that I actually felt my pulse quicken and more than once I put it down afraid to go on, only to pick it right back up again because I had to know. The characters were wonderfully written and multi-dementional, discribed in a way that allowed me to see and to know them. Katniss herself is a fantastic breath of fresh air so unlike a lot of the weak or watered down heroines I have often seen in YA books. While the story is brutal and violent this is not over-done and there is still a stark beauty to the story as we watch the good and the bad of humanity unfold. Collins takes an impossible situation and not only makes it plausible but she also allows her characters to respond and evolve in a natural way. This was an incredible story that was equally well told.

0525423281|5.0|If you haven't read Lola yet, what are you waiting for?  Seriously.  Just think...could Anna and the French Kiss be any better?  Yes, it can and this book is that better.  I was looking forward to this book for obvious reasons but at the same time I was weary - would I love this book as much as the first or would it disappoint?  As much as I thought about this book and waited for it for months, it went way beyond my expectations.  The small problems I had with Anna were addressed in this book.  St. Clair is short?  Cricket is tall.  Stuff like that.<br /><br />Lola is one hell of a character to begin with.  She's a loving wig and costume wearer and doesn't believe in wearing the same thing twice.  She likes standing out and sparkling and if you don't get her than that's your problem.  She's so easily to relate to even though she appears to be such an extreme.  While it might not be how I dressed that I was passionate about at that age, we all had that one thing that other people didn't really understand.  It's the great overarching theme that connects all teenagers.  They're all unique and intricate.  Perkins writes it so well that you know she just gets it.  Is it to soon to name Perkins my favorite author?  Because I just might.<br /><br />Moving on to Cricket...where to start?  Where Anna pined after St. Clair, Cricket pines after Lola.  When I say pine I mean pine, but in the best possible sense.  Even though Lola is dating a little bit of a loser, Cricket tries to be the best friend that he can be even though they have somewhat of a storied past.  What's great about Cricket is that he is the total nice, perfect guy.  There aren't enough words to describe the way he acts and the emotions that he evokes.  It's one of those things that you really just have to experience yourself by reading the book.<br /><br />If you haven't picked it up yet, I'm pretty sure this book is perfect.  It can do no wrong.  Plus, you get to see Anna and St. Clair be adorable together again.  There's no reason why you shouldn't read this book.  What are you waiting for?  Go get your copy now!

B000YXMMAE|5.0|The King of Limbs, Radiohead`s latest and most cursory album to date, drew perhaps the most contrarily divergent response of their career. That is to say, it was their first album in years that didn't inspire widespread fellating of the group and the extent of their virtues. Fans and critics had many bones to pick with the LP, citing everything from its short, eight-track, sub-40-minute length to how it sounded more a Yorke solo record than a Radiohead album to many ears, in how it heavily downplayed a full band aesthetic. As time passed though, the album seems to have grown on most, no doubt helped along by the fleshed-out takes the band debuted on BBC's In the Basement back in July and spur-of-the-moment shows at Glastonbury and New York's Roseland Ballroom. Radiohead, in their typically deliberate manner, released this here remix project, piece by piece from July till last week, willing you to take it bit by bit, completely on their terms.

Ordered the audio version thinking it would be linked to Amazon online music storage instead I got 20 something CD's I now need to rip and somehow turn into an audio book.  Over priced compared to the paper version and now I have a lot of work to do to make this work.  The package doesn't even come with a complete paper list of tracks so you know which recording is next.  I would return this if I could.

B005KJZDXK|5.0|\\"A Very She and Him Christmas\\" contains a timeless collection of Christmas classics that may add a bit of holiday cheer to one's listening pleasure.  Indeed, the set of songs are perennial favorites that have been played and sung for decades by a countless number of performers.  However, this is She and Him and any cover or rendition that they perform has a quality of their own but with subtle influences that are heard throughout their music that blend an uncanny resemblance to legendary artists of the past five decades, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and everything in between before that.  With Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward as the creative duo that comprises She and Him, these holiday classics come to life once again.<br /><br />All of the songs on the record are memorable and resonate a nostalgic flare.  One never grows tired of hearing \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" or \\"Rocking' Around the Christmas Tree.\\"  And with the mention of the Beach Boys, listeners will find \\"Christmas Day\\" and \\"Little Saint Nick\\" a delight to hear.<br /><br />It is always a pleasure to see a new generation of musical artists continuing to perform these holiday melodies especially during this day and age.  And with the convenience of digital recordings that are released, it is always nice to know that vinyl and CD formats are still available.  With the release of \\"A Very She and Him Christmas\\" one of the treats of having this CD is that it comes with a few extras that usually does not come with a digital download, brief liner notes that come in the form of a red envelope that looks like a Christmas card.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I've been listening to this album on repeat since I bought it. Gorgeous, lush, heartbreaking music. I bought the album on the strength of \\"Midnight City\\", and it's going to be a favourite for years to come, I think.
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|Post-Apocalyptic world with the scariest vamps you've ever seen! I repeated my title so that you understand I'm not joking! The human story is so vivid and tense, yet the main characters find a way to create family in this world.  But the evil they fight comes from vamps (that are almost zombies by their nature) and humans, alike. Just watch it if you like horror with a solid story - this has great ratings on another very popular rental site for personal devices...so don't let the very few ratings here throw you off!
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I didn't think this movie was going to be any better than the planet of the apes with mark wahlburg.  I would suggest this movie to everybody!  I absolutely loved it.  Very emotional and touching.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a great homage to Steve Jobs, his vision, and how he changed the computing world. With never-before-permitted access to Jobs himself (who commented on and edited the book to some degree) this is a true look at Jobs thinking, his career, and his life.   A must have for one's collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I must be the only person in the world who hadn't heard of this series, and I finally caved and got the trilogy.  I had no idea what the books were even about -- and I devoured the first book in two days.<br /><br />I found strong elements of \\"The Running Man\\" by Stephen King and \\"The Lottery\\" by Shirley Jackson, but I don't feel the book is a copy of either.  The book stands on its own merit.  Katniss and Peeta, the main characters, are fighting to stay alive in the annual Hunger Games, a \\"game\\" of survival by wits, weapons, and will.  Both main characters are richly developed, and even lesser characters who only appear in a few chapters are given their own importance and significance.<br /><br />The ending leaves the reader in suspense and eager for the next book.  I can't wait to start it.  However, I was rather surprised the book was written for a teen audience.  A lot of kids in my son's third grade class are completely capable of reading on this level, and I think it might be too much for some of them.  I'd recommend a parent read the book first (hardly a chore for most!) and decide then if it's appropriate yet for your child.  Just my two cents, your mileage may vary.)<br /><br />Excellent book, a completely departure-from-the-world book.  Highly recommended.
0891419063|5.0|This is a book which I read from cover to cover the first day it came by post.  A story of grit, determination and bravery in the most miserable and dangerous conditions imaginable, told from first hand experience of a true combat veteran of two of the most bloody battles of the Pacific campaign.<br /><br />Clear and to the point, it tells of the horrors faced on Peleliu and Okinawa and the losses against a determined and fanatical enemy who were prepared to fight to the death with a determination seldom seen on the European battlefields.<br /><br />For any student of history on WW2 and the fight to drive the Japanese back to their homeland this book would fit well in their library..  It is little wonder that it was used in part for the background to the excellent mini series \\"The Pacific\\".
B000KRNF3W|5.0|Marbles is a repackaging of John's second release Devotion (1970).  I am not familiar with this version but know there were some complaints regarding sound quality with an earlier reissue on Fuel 2000. I have an earlier reissue on Metrotone (I think) with good sound and original pyschadelic cover.  The recording features Larry Young on organ ,unique and incredible,  with the rhythm section of Buddy Miles and Billy Rich.  Devotion is sometimes referred to as John's \\"rock\\" album.  There is not much of an overt jazz, Indian or classical thing going on. The influence of Jimi Hendrix is very present but not as some pale imitation.  It certainly bares the stamp of John's magnificent and unique approach and abilities as a guitarist and writer.  Like the preceding \\"Extrapolation\\"  ,electric jazz masterpiece, and succeeding \\"My Goal's Beyond\\" ,acoustic jazz masterpiece, Devotion was a one time project.  There were no follow-up recordings.  All three recordings are very unique and masterpieces.  Still hard for me to fathom that they were all recorded by same artist and in a row at that.

0545259088|3.0|This one is set in early Summer, has a red cover and red print. I still *really* like the design as I did with Linger. So did I enjoy this last novel in the series more than #2 because I figured out the right combination of slippers & socks and I'm not cold--and I finished it in a heated house? It feels about that arbitrary. Sam and Grace are still in love, and Cole and Isabel are in something. But Isabel's dad has determined there will be an aerial wolf hunt for the wolves of the Boundary Wood. And Cole's trying to heal the wolves.<br /><br />(Here's a tip Mr. Rockstar/ scientist: the werewolves turn into wolves in this universe in the cold, so get them out of Northern Minnesota, and to the Equator!)<br /><br />Received from the Amazon Vine program.
B004VMX5TQ|3.0|Having no Bob Seger on my iPod, the reissues are welcome. Can't say this was the best choice. The sound quality is just ok and as with most live recordings the crowd noise is a serious impediment. Plus Turn the Page, one of my favorites is not on this CD. I'd search other recordings for those wanting to add to their digital libraries.
0743289412|1.0|300 pages into this 500 page novel, I set it aside. Really boring and no narrative drive, which is usually King's strength.  For years, I'd heard how bad this was, how it was simply a mash-up of Gerald's Game and Misery--with a little Bag of Bones added--and sadly, it was.

B003Q6D25K|3.0|Coming off the heels of a tiny 2007 film not widely released until two years later (budget was 15,000 dollars, ended up making close to 200 million), this sequel suffers from what many filmmakers astonishingly decide to do when a taut little package turns out to be pure gold; make it bigger, and most of all, make it dumber.<br /><br />What was probably most shocking about the first movie is that the paranormal activity around Katie was inexplicable.  There was no apparent reason other than randomness, no apparent solution, no explanation, nothing at all.  It was just there, haunting HER and not her house, and tormenting her for the demonic lulz.<br /><br />The mystery of it all was probably one of the strongest parts of what would otherwise be a conventional horror film (shot unconventionally).  Few things sap the intrigue and suspense from a horror film more than seeing the main character talking to \\"ghost experts\\" or researching at the library, uncovering everything about the supernatural whatever.  The Ring was great and all, but I find it hard to take a ghosty girl seriously when she died in the 1980s in a conventional way, and just didn't like horses because they were noisy.  It gets particularly annoying when mystery films or shows neatly wrap everything up with full-fledged explanations for every little clue, detail, motive, etcetera.  Part of the reason I love Law and Order (original) and dislike Law and Order Criminal Intent is that the vast majority of the time (in original) you NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN if the person on trial really did the crime.  You are left in the same position as real life; something bad happened, and someone got punished (or escaped punishment) based on the decision of 12 random people.<br /><br />Instead, this film would rather treat the audience as dumb, and have every facet of the film series in general explained and actions taken made very explicitly clear even early on in the film.  It made for a very disappointing film experience.<br /><br />First thing's first; it's scary, like the first film.  In my opinion, though, they reached too far, and the terror factor was diminished by the \\"embiggening\\" of the paranormal activity.  Things randomly moving on their own, doors creaking slightly, footsteps and noises occurring, sheets fluttering as if someone invisible were sliding into bed with you, people seemingly posessed and standing in place for hours on end, these were frightening, and present in both films.  This one adds more \\"stuff\\", more things moving around, more blatant \\"presences\\", more expensive set-pieces (like every drawer and cabinet in the kitchen bursting open at once).<br /><br />It wasn't too big of a deal, not nearly enough to use \\"less is more\\" as a complaint.  Instead, I use it as a complaint with regards to story.<br /><br />In the first movie, we meet Katie and Micah, a young couple with a camera, who start talking about ghosts and hauntings very early into the film.  The camera is set up to try and catch some of this activity, though it's not explained why until later.  The details unraveled are essentially: It's not a ghost, it's a demon, and it's not stuck to the house, but is after Katie herself, and will follow her no matter where she lives.<br /><br />How, why, nothing else is answered.  Nothing else is explained beyond this.  The demon has a partly-burnt photo of Katie as a little girl that it leaves in the attic to spook them.  How, why, nothing is answered.  The only apparent link was with some woman who experienced nearly identical hauntings decades earlier until she died.  Anything else related to that is not explained.<br /><br />In this film, it is established that the new girl, Kristi, is Katie's sister, and the events here are taking place 2 months before the events of the first film.  Same MO, slightly different spook-tactics, this time with a new factor; a baby boy.<br /><br />Close to the middle, but somewhat before that, in the movie, you're pretty much informed outright that the demon is after the baby, Hunter, despite what daughter Ali's boyfriend would deduce after tricking her with the ouija board (pussyhunt).  After a long period of spooky-haunting stuff, the real appeal of this movie, they begin tying it in to the first movie by providing explanation as to why the demon is haunting her, and providing a pathetically flimsy out that mirrors that of The Ring 2---turns out Kristi's demonic haunting is passed on to Katie, as depicted in the first film.<br /><br />Then adding the \\"sequel\\" bit to the \\"sequel-prequel\\" billing, Katie appears in their home, presumably moments after the events of the first film.  What transpires is pretty much pointless and no longer scary.<br /><br />But it's a franchise now.  I say that these expository events that excise all the mystery and terror of the unknown would have enhanced the movie... and yet I realize, without these things, the movie would essentially be a remake of the first.  It would've been great in hindsight if all these connections with the first movie were left unspoken, but even I don't think I would be able to put it together without the exposition.<br /><br />So basically, the explanations and the mystery-killing nature of it is essential for this film to even exist without being derided as a pointless cash-grabby remake.  It ruins the first film a bit (for me at least) but it gives THIS film its purpose.  It could still arguably be called a pointless cash-grabby remake, but it would at least fit in to the franchise as it stands now.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|Sony decided to lim back at this often overlooked franchise and they found magic. Ico and more to my point Shadow of the Colossus deliver on solid storytelling, combat and interactions (note Agro's movements if you have any questions). These games are also unlike any other games on the market. Lastly, the hi definition 3d is just a bonus treat. Pick up this combo pack and try out a game where you won't feel a little dirty after playing.

I can see why, not his best!
1451648537|4.0|It is always fascinating to read a biography on perhaps the greatest technologist ever.  This is the third or fourth biography that I am reading about Steve Jobs, a man who has had a fascinating personal life as well as professional career.  So, one would feel that it is not too hard to make a book about him interesting.  I mean, when the character is as colorful as Steve Jobs, it is like flowing with the current in a river.<br /><br />What's fascinating about this book is that it is the first authorized biography.  So, Steve Jobs has given a first hand account of himself and how he feels about certain things.  His insight and thoughts on the subject makes for very interesting reading.  You realize that for all of his magnetic aura, he has a fragile personality, who was so susceptible to emotional breakdowns.  Everything is interesting about his life - the way he starts Apple with Steve Wozniak, how Apple II evolves, his relationship with his first girlfriend, how he deals with his daughter Lisa, how he is is pushed out of Apple, the start of NeXT, his binding with Pixar, his second coming at Apple, and the re-introduction of world class products year after year.  It is well captured as to why he feels so strongly about an integrated system (or rather the closed system).  There are elements of humor well captured.  When he worked with the architects on the new Apple campus (the spaceship campus), there is a hilarious take by the author.<br /><br />There was a debate with some oft the architects, who wanted to allow the windows to be opened.  Jobs had never liked the idea of people being able to open things.  \\"That would just allow people to screw things up,\\" he declared.<br /><br />There are several biographies on Jobs, but I am not sure if one would get a deeper perspective on his personality than the one that is covered here.<br /><br />I miss that there is no mention of how the notebook computers found its way into the fold.  Also, the narration is not a sequence.  Sometimes, it feels as though the events are stitched together by a set of events, as they are discussed back and forth.  Sometimes, it is good when you are taken back in time, but at other times, it feels the continuity is disturbed.  That would make the overall experience feel as though you are reading some disjointed sections, as though it is put up for technical review.<br /><br />But, overall, the book is a fascinating, fast paced read, and as colorful as the character discussed.  I would say there are more pros than cons.  The personal content, and to hear it right from the horse's mouth is what makes this a fun filled roller coaster.events are stitched together by a set of events, as they are discussed back and forth.

B001FB563E|5.0|I've long been a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre when it comes to fiction and games.  The Road definitely fits that category!  The story, as the description indicates, is largely based on the journey that a father and his son take after the world ends.  All the vegetation has been decimated, and the animals are long gone.  The only life that remains are a few packs of mostly unsavory (which is probably why they kept trying to eat newly-found people) humans trying to get by.  The cast and crew did an amazing job:  This film was uncomfortable to watch most of the time!  As the story kept unfolding, I kept wondering what'd happen next.  The final events leading up to the end weren't a huge surprise, but the very end had a subtle twist that I thought was quite well done!  My response was simply: \\"Wow?!\\"
B000000WJZ|5.0|I read a ton of reviews today, enjoying the many great things that have been said about this album.  Generally it seems there are two groups of fans: those that discovered the album when it was released in 1993 and those that discovered it later in life, but came to love it \\"in hindsight.\\"  As a member of the former group I can't tell you how much enjoyment I get reading the reviews of those from the latter group.  Isn't that the beauty of great music?  Standing the test of time.  Moving people years later, when its first impact is long over.    At 13 years old this was the first album I ever purchased.  \\"Today\\" brought me to the store.  It was like nothing I had ever heard.  Eighteen years later I'm 32 years old drinking coffee this morning having a Smashing Pumpkins weekend, writing a 5 star review on Amazon just to join the chorus of fans here that want to celebrate one of the truly greatest albums ever produced.    Hopefully you will find this little bit of research interesting.  I was blown away at the volume of 5 star votes this album received here on Amazon.  Not in a surprising way but in a \\"Wow, people LOVE this album way!\\"  88.5% of the people that have rated this album gave it a 5 star review.  That percentage is higher than the following albums: Nirvana (Nevermind), Radiohead (OK Computer), Radiohead (The Bends), Metallica (Metallica), Guns N Roses (Appetite for Destruction), Michael Jackson (Thriller), Weezer (Weezer), Green Day (Dookie), Rage Against the Machine (Rage Against the Machine), Soundgarden (Superunknown), Red Hot Chili Peppers (Blood Sugar Sex Magik), REM (Automatic for the People), U2 (The Joshua Tree), Beastie Boys (Licensed to Ill), Jane's Addiction (Nothings Shocking), and finally Pearl Jam (Ten).    In other words Siamese Dream can make a case as the most quality rock album of its era, according to the voters of this website.    Measures such as these are the reason I truly believe this album will continue to age very well and ultimately be considered higher and higher on the lists of all-time great albums.
0553801473|3.0|To begin with, I want to express my admiration for the first three books in a Song of Ice and Fire.  After reading a feast for crows I thought, \\"Well, okay, I'll see where it goes from here.\\"  Having finished a Dance with Dragons I am worried that the solid foundation that was set up with the first three books might end up going to waste.  George RR Martin has abandoned many of the strong points of the first three books but, if you have come this far, you might still want to read this one and I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from that.<br /><br />The narration difficulties that began to peek through in a Feast for Crows turn into full blown problems.  I think it is a distinct possibility that the world of Westeros has been opened up to wide to get any place in a quickly or orderly fashion.  A Dance with Dragons is not so much a novel but a pile of installments for a bunch of story lines and does not include the traditional structures normally found in a novel, there is no climax, no rising action, it is all just set up, jumping from viewpoint to viewpoint.<br /><br />Yet, unlike in the earlier books, where the multiple view points served as a definite point of strength, they don't add much to the plot apart from furthering the different story lines. Earlier books created a strong sense of contrast between the morality, innocence, guile and desire of different characters.  In a Dance with Dragons that contrast is gone.  The potency of the different viewpoints has ebbed away as each character seems to wallow is a gray area, little different from any of the other characters in the book.<br /><br />The book also falls into the pit falls of a weaker genre of fantasy with lost characters reappearing too conveniently and a feeling that, maybe, Martin has finally settled upon a set of characters that he will keep around for a while without killing them off.  Near the end of the book Martin suddenly seems to wake up to their safety and makes a few brash moves but combined with the same style viewpoint of the characters and the lack of built up suspense these events carry far less emotional impact than they should.<br /><br />Now it is time for my last big complaint, which may seem like a small one but is, in truth, a hallmark that sets the tone for much of a Song of Ice and Fire.  What about the direwolves?  So, Jon Snow pats Ghost on the head a few times.  Great!  The wolves brought an edge and a unity to the earlier novels that is almost completely missing.  They served to bring a sense of purpose, of something happening, of something bloody and gritty but at the same time transcendent, unifying the Starks and the readers sympathies.  Saying, \\"I may be a savage, untamed beast but here at least is something you can hope for, root for, just a little bit.\\"<br /><br />Hopefully Martin can pull it all together for the rest of the series.  If my admiration for the first three books is able to survive the pile of mediocrity that is a Dance with Dragons by the time the next book comes along I will still definitely give it a try.  \\"Come on Martin, Pull it together!\\"

0316098329|5.0|I'm an avid reader, a guilty pleasure I have to steal from work and family; I don't have time to waste (i.e. maybe a chapter in between chores a day) and so I cull from the award-winners' lists when I run out of recommendations, hoping for something that might be spot-on rich to justify the time. (I'll leave out comments on my annoyance with the constant setting of New York for those chosen as worthy of literary commendation (hello, life happens in the rest of the world too)). This book hit me hard; I'm too tired to write a decent review because I stayed up too late and got up to early to read this. Jack is riveting. So is Mama. You'll see.

I felt disappointed that only a photo was shown of Job's dad, his Mom left out, also lack of photos of Steve as a child. Maybe this was his wish?  Not sure why Steve's Mom was not shown, why not include a family potrait of them? His Mom -Clara is hardly mentioned, her death is never mentioned and she is not discussed at all besides maybe 6 sentences.. He says he loved his parents and they seemed so close.. Wedding photo, etc.? It leaves the reader wanting to read a more compelete bio of Steve Jobs.<br /><br />I found this weird.

Three hundred also holds true to history, for all you historical nuts, which I can attest to because of A- in Western Civ. given to me by my professor. None the less if you like action, sword play, blood and guts, and understandable plots BUY THIS DVD!!!! You won't regret it.
B005UT29Z0|1.0|Two hours of excruciatingly boring dialogue and general lack of interesting storytelling. No twists, no satisfying accomplishments or any reason to like the characters at all. We kept hoping one of the characters would be shot and/or shoot himself, but sadly this did not happen. Sam's dying dog is intended to be a metaphor for the financial industry or the stock market, but it better applies to the movie itself - a long, drawn out process with no human element.
1442419814|3.0|I think this book is interesting enough, but it isn't done well.   The world Westerfeld created isn't fully fleshed out. You don't get immersed in it like other authors have accomplished in creating an alternate/new/unknown world (J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter being the obvious example, Hunger Games being a more recent example). It feels blanker than it should, and very hard to connect with because it isn't expounded upon in key ways. I had a hard time feeling like I could \\"see\\" this book, even though there are lovely small descriptions of the physical environment from time to time. The universe in it was just too much like ours with futuristic examples that didn't fully make it organically new (as though you could feel the natural evolution of humanity through the time that passed), different, or authentic feeling. It's almost as if the author had spent so much time imagining or thinking about his new universe that he had learned to assume or forego key elements of it that needed to be explained in the book in order to make it seem real; like someone who's seen a movie and tries to explain it to you without going into detail.   Things also happen in vague or unexplained ways, furthering the feeling of gaps and missing information. For example, someone will stop laughing without there first being a description of them starting; or someone opens their eyes, well, I don't remember you closing them. Small things like that that leave you a little confused and not entirely sure what happened. This criticism is related to the mechanics of writing, not the content. Another example: when Tally and David plan the escape, we know the captors had gathered an entire community of people. When they complete the escape, the party is only 7 people. What happened to everyone else and why did it seem like they knew they were only going to get a few people and no discussion  was given to the whereabouts of the rest? I suppose you are just left to assume what happened to them.  BesidesTally (who is barely fully developed as a character in any way herself), very few of the other characters are rounded out. The closest are David and Shay, who spend more time in the plot, but any tertiary character outside of that is not really individualized or personalized in any way. Yet another flaw that makes this book feel undigested and half-done.  Toward the end of the book, things take on a summarized feel, to wrap up loose ends and get to the conclusion, which seems like a strange misstep given that this book was the first of a planned trilogy. I think the pacing was off. I didn't have any investment in the story besides idle curiosity until midway through.  As far as the story itself, it is fresh and interesting enough to capture your attention, and I wasn't entirely or exactly bored while reading. In fact, the premise itself is probably the book's most/only redeeming factor. I will read the next book based on the curiosity the story generates, but I will still be hoping it improves. A good comparison of what the author tried and failed to do is The Giver. The general theme and subsequent universe is very similar only it's painfully obvious that Lowry's just works effortlessly and Westerfeld's is clunky and... bad.  This series could have been as big as Hunger Games in the hands of a more capable writer - dystopian YA being the new thing now, it seems - but it couldn't deliver on its potential.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book quickly. It kept me captivated from the start with all the adventure. The ending was a bit boring and the book is somewhat predictable as everything somehow seems to work out for the main character. Its not as enthralling as Twilight or True Blood but very close to it. Defnitely worth buying however I wont be buying the second book as this one didnt make me crave for more really. Nice for a weekend read.

Ferguson has always wanted to be a hedgefund and wall street banker,but he ended up an economist, he has no problems boasting the wallstreet image. I can eventually see that character in the book.
030788743X|3.0|This book seemed like it would have everything I enjoyed: video games, the 80's, a quest, a love story.  And to be fair, it did have those things, but it was handled in such a heavy-handed way that I kept getting disconnected from the story.  The book could have been so much more if written by someone with a little more experience in crafting a novel.  Now some of this I blame on the editor, but much of it has to rest on the author.  I will give the author the benefit of the doubt in this case, as this is a first novel, but I hope that future books are a little more polished.<br /><br />The book starts out nice and dark, and I'm thinking it's going to be a fabulous post-apocalyptic novel, but that whole setting seems to be basically ignored after the first couple of chapters in favor of the online universe.  This is understandable, I suppose, but it would have made a much better novel if the darkness of reality had continued to be shown at odds with the limitlessness of the online universe.  As it is, we only get glimpses.  As we leave behind the darkness of reality, the main character also becomes more and more self-centered and obnoxious, and I went from feeling sorry for him and wishing that he would accomplish a great deal to being irritated with his character and almost cheering when he was thwarted.  I guess this could be a way of showing that power corrupts, but it wasn't very effectively done, if even meant by the author in the first place.<br /><br />I also had a problem with a kid of the main character's age being able to absorb ALL of the pop culture from the 80's, in addition to some references from later decades.  How many hours would it take to watch EVERY 80's TV show and movie (enough to be able to quote each one, including inflections), listen to EVERY 80's album (enough to be able to remember all the lyrics), and play EVERY 80's video game to the point of perfection?  And this is supposedly a kid who is in high school for hours each day.  It just doesn't seem possible unless the main character never sleeps and is really 35.  There's also a bit based in reality later in the novel that just didn't seem likely, again considering the character's age and prior experiences in reality, but I won't give details so as not to spoil the book for others.<br /><br />I did enjoy the 80's references, but it seems like the author had a list of things he wanted to work into the book, and towards the end he started getting worried that he wouldn't be able to fit it all.  This is when we start seeing things like spaceships that look like the Millennium Falcon, but named Serenity (wait...wasn't Firefly aired in the early 2000's?), parked next to a Delorean with a license plate of Ecto-1.  It's a little jarring and feels a lot forced.<br /><br />Aside from these issues, it's a fun book, as long as you approach it from the perspective of young adult beach reading.  I was definitely amused by the references, some of which I hadn't heard mention of since, well, the 80's, and the video game and online worlds.  The best parts of the book are when Parzival is actually doing something related to the quest, with the bits in between being a bit clumsy and forced.  I think the book could be amusing for most, but don't think you're getting something on the level of Crime and Punishment.unless the main character never sleeps and is really 35.

B004IAR4Q6|5.0|I was flipping through an issue of Rolling Stone (in late 2010)to find on the \\"In the Studio\\" column story of Gregg Allman and T-Bone Burnett making an album together.  I didn't even read the article. I've been a fan of the Allman Brothers for years now and I've been a fan of T-Bone Burnett's production style since he did the soundtracks for \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\" and \\"Walk the Line\\" and his earthy production for the Robert Plant/Alison Krauss collaboration \\"Raising Sand\\".<br />I don't know what I was expecting. I know Gregg has got to be one of the greatest white blues singers....and I had forgotten that too. What gets me about this album is the production that T-Bone Burnett brings to this project. T-Bone takes these albums that are made in this century and makes them sound like they were made in the 1930's or 40's.  I listen to these blues covers and I think that finally someone has done this right.  Many blues artists and mainstream artists schooled in the blues try hard to make a blues album. But, somehow they fall short. I listen to the sparseness of Floating Bridge and Devil Got My Woman and I thought this was a Robert Johnson type of recording.  I'm a big fan of Eric Clapton and I think his blues albums are fantastic. But, I really wanted his Me & Mr Johnson album to be much more earthy like this album.  T-Bone Burnett recently produced another collaboration with Elton John and Leon Russell called The Union. So, I propose to Mr. Clapton to seek out Gregg Allman and T-Bone Burnett and make a truly great blues album. This just seems like the perfect pairing since Eric and Gregg's big brother Duane recorded Clapton's Derek and the Dominos Layla.<br />I am really excited that a new release in 2011 has me pumped up for new music. This is not a sterile studio album. It is an album that breathes the blues. To add to how great it is, Gregg (and T-Bone) has Dr John, Doyle Bramhall II, Warren Haynes and the rhythm section of bassist Dennis Crouch and drummer Jay Bellerose(from the Plant/Krauss' Raising Sand) playing on this album.<br />It's not often that I feel the need to sit down, talk and write about an album I'm enthusiastic about. But, this is one of them.  If you love a GREAT blues album with great musicians, I highly recommend this one.  If you love Gregg Allman's vocals....If you love the production work of T-Bone Burnett....and if love great music,  Trust me on this one! You'll love it!Bellerose(from the Plant/Krauss' Raising Sand) playing on this album.<br />It's not often that I feel the need to sit down, talk and write about an album I'm enthusiastic about.

B005DKLPQ0|5.0|I'm not going to review the albums, if you are considering this set then you already love them.  The most important thing is that the remixing and remastering on these albums are incredible.  Johnny hit it out of the park.  I have been listening to these albums since the day they each came out and heard things in the new mixes I had no idea were there before.  Sounds buried in the original mix have been brought out to the light of day and we are all the better for it.<br /><br />The only thing that could have maded this set any better would have been if they had included a bonus disc with all the albums in instrumental form. Nothing against Morrissey, its just that as I get older it's Marr's music that has stood the test of time more than Moz's lyrics or singing.  Great set though, get it if you are a longtime fan.  Yes, there is a song or two missing, but really no one cares about that except for the completist freaks.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|In order to enjoy it, one has to forget about the story: it is stupid and male chauvanist. But the music is divine, the singers -every one of them- excellent and, less usual, also very good actors: passed are the days where you had to close your eyes in order to imagine that the beautiful voice singing the beautiful airia belonged to a human being and not to a robot! Very enjoyable.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|When I change my wallpaper, selections come up to use Gallery, Wallpaper, or Downloads.  Thats what everyone is used to.  Then clicking Gallery used to bring you STRAIGHT to you Gallery photos.  Well, not anymore!  Now clicking gallery requires an extra step to get there!  After clicking, it now says GALLERY (again!) and OfficeSuitePro!!  So now I have to again select Gallery bec this app has the capability of letting you view your gallery photos through it?? What if I downloaded SEVERAL apps that have that capability?  I then would have to SCROLL through a LIST of these apps to find my regular old GALLERY?  What nerve an app has of integrating itself into the basic wallpaper menu like that!  And the kicker is, I never even opened and set up the app itself, just downloaded and installed from Amazon!  When I select my GALLERY, I expect to go to my GALLERY, not be asked HOW I want to get there!  At the very least, give the option to have it NOT do that.... or just put their OSPro icon in the WALLPAPER MENU, so I could select either IT *OR* the Gallery!!

Considering it affects everyone  this book opens the world to what really cancer is, how humans have dealt with it through the ages and where we are at now. Even someone who has no science or medical background can learn a lot about this subject. The book is over 400pp and was worth the time to read the science to get to the real stories.

B0057O6IDW|5.0|I was rather surprised to learn that one of my personal favorites, \\"House By The Cemetery,\\" was being remastered for release on Blu-ray disc... Many editions exist; some are good, others not so good (stay away from the edition renamed \\"Zombie Hell House\\"). Blue Underground did a classic justice. Not only does the movie look great, but the bonus features are outstanding. Stand-outs include the interviews with the \\"children,\\" Silvia Collatina and Giovanni Frezza, who played Mae and Bob, respectively. Both interviews were insightful as far as working with the Maestro goes, but I had to laugh when the first thing Giovanni did was apologize for the Bob voice-over! \\"House By The Cemetery\\" on Blu-ray: what are you waiting for? Get it.
B0041KKYGA|5.0|Fascinating!<br />I have, we have heard the rumor all our lives that they plays credited to William Shakespeare were not written by him. they were written by various people.  I never cared. Fodder for scholars? Not here. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. If you want to see a movie with intellectual depth, suspense, intrigue, this is it.<br /><br />Why? That is the big question and this movie poses a tantalizing premise of not only who wrote the plays, the Earl of Oxford, but why he wrote them and why he could have had his head loped off if he had signed them. Shakespeare is portrayed as a semi-illiterate patsy, selected by intermediary Ben Johnson, who would go on the be the most beloved poet of his day. I won't give away more plot except to say that the movie implies that nearly ALL of the plays credited to the (supposedly) illiterate Shakespeare were political, portraits about the Elizabethan times, Midsummer's Night, Julius Caesar, King Leer, especially Richard the Third, were all oblique and therefore potentially treasonous commentaries about contemporary Elizabethan court and government figures. What happened to Kit Marlowe? Murder , mystery, intrigue.<br /><br />This movie presents a really diffferent slant on various semingly unrelated historical events. Whether you agree or not with the author's premise, it's a clever, interesting movie. A different slant.<br /><br />You have to get used to the available light, candlelight, torchlight shots, and in the beginning the movie jumps back and forth present,  and past and a large cast of character at various stages of their life, but this is a movie you can really get your teeth into. A really different look at Elizabethan times, for those familiar with the subject. Vanessa Redgrave plays a part she has played for the last 40 some years, Elizabeth I, Rhys Ifans plays the Earl of Oxford.  Very Plausible! A contemporary Derek Jacobi comes in at the beginning and end with some shocking Shakespear details.<br /><br />Highest recommendation. Those tired of superhero movies and rom-coms will find substance here.Those tired of superhero movies and rom-coms will find substance here.

0385534639|5.0|This book has been one of the biggest talked about books this year and I couldn't WAIT to get my hands on it. I'm always nervous about reading a book with so much hype about it but this one did NOT disappoint!  The Good: Where to even start?! First of all if the concept, characters and plot wasn't enough the language. Oh my god, the language. One of the most beautifully written novels I've read in a VERY long time. You would think this is Morgenstern's tenth novel...not her first. I am usually the type of reader who flies through books, because I can. And I'm a fast reader. But with The Night Circus, I took my sweet time reading it because I was literally savoring the sentences. Some of the sentences were like delicious, moist steaks dripping with literary juice. Yum. The setting is tremendously amazing. We've all read books about the circus no? Well this setting is beyond the circus... the circus is EVERYTHING. It's a completely beautiful, crazy world for the characters. I love every stinking inch of that damn circus. Had I been a character in the novel, I would have been decked out in red and called a Rêveur. (In the book that is someone who adores the circus and follows it around like a groupie and then writes reviews on it. So basically a blogger in circus land.) I know that some people had a hard time becoming invested in Marco and Celia's love affair but it came easily to me. I found them delightfully lovely and completely in love. Their love for each other was splendid and I love the fact that their relationship is doomed from the very beginning, an inevitable escape. But they find a way to cheat the system. I love that. I also loved SO many of the other characters. Bailey, Poppet and Widget. I love Herr Theisen and so many others. Have I not convinced you yet? Luckily, I have more good things to say about the book. Not only is the writing beautiful, but the comedic timing is perfect. There are seriously some lines that I laughed out loud at. There is quitea bit of tongue-in-cheek references and I find it very sneaky and very craftily done. Also the dialogue in the book is some of the best dialogue I've seen in a novel. I felt like I was watching a movie of the characters interacting rather than reading it. It was so easy to imagine the scene right in front of my eyes...which is why I'm not surprised that the movie rights have already sold to Summit and it will be made in a movie. I have no doubt that it will translate beautifully to the big screen. Morgenstern did awesome with her villains. They were creepy in that I-can't-believe-they-are-acting-and-saying-that kind of way. Morgenstern was able to capture the essence of being evil without having to make her characters into literally monsters, ghosts etc. I nearly tore my hair out when I was only several pages from the ending because I just did NOT want it to end. I wanted to live in the circus forever. Perhaps that is why my dream the night I finished the book contained vivid images of a black and white themed circus.  The Bad: Really, I have nothing bad to say about this book!  Overall, this book has shot to the top of my favorites and I highly recommend it. I know it's not going to be a book for everyone and I'm sure there are many people who will disagree with my view of the book but I cannot contain my love of this novel! A+!!

It offers a deep-seeded plot, centered within reality (well, as close as you can get to reality in entertainment). So, no high-voltage action, or steamy sex scenes, but a well thought out and admirable movie.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|I saw a Kevin Spacey interview where he claims the practices in \\"Margin Call\\" are still going on today. This review contains some early plot synopsis for those who may have some trouble with the Wall Street jargon. The film appears to be about a fictional investment firm at the start of the 2008 financial crisis.<br /><br />The drama opens with an investment bank downsizing. An outside agency has been hired to do the layoffs. We see sad scenes of people being tapped and escorted out. This company laid off much of its middle level management layers and kept the worker bees. Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), a big boss is visibly upset. He has a bottle of Pepto-Bismo on his desk. His Chocolate Lab is dying. Spacey is spending $1,000 a day to keep his dog alive. While he appears to be reviving his role in \\"Horrible Bosses\\"  we later find out he is our closest thing to a good guy.<br /><br />One of the laid off mid-level bosses, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) hands off a thumb drive to Seth Bregman (Zachary Quinto) who burns the midnight oil going over the data. Bregman panics at the numbers. The volatility index (VI) indicates the company will incur losses that will greatly exceed its total assets. The firm goes into panic mode. The company holds bad assets known as derivatives which is nothing more than pieces of various risk mortgages lumped together. If they attempt to dump them all, without buying, people will suspect something is up and won't buy their assets. If they wait too long to dump them, the fear is someone else will figure out what is going on and beat them to the punch. They are between the proverbial \\"rock and a hard place.\\"<br /><br />This sets the wheels in motion as the CEO is notified that the company may collaspe.<br /><br />Penn Badgley views their job as legalized gambling. They make $250,000 a year crunching numbers and think their bosses who make $2.5 million a year are obscenely overpaid. Jeremy Irons plays the stereotypical CEO who doesn't seem knowledgeable about their product.<br /><br />Now in spite of the fact this is dealing with issues beyond most people's lives, everyone one of us knows the results of an economy crash. The actors did a superb job holding our interest in the film as each person handles the stress differently.<br /><br />What will the investment firm do to survive? As things get ugly, the drama becomes more interesting.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex or nudity. Rare film that has strippers and Demi Moore in which she is not one of them.of the fact this is dealing with issues beyond most people's lives, everyone one of us knows the results of an economy crash.

1451648537|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and read it in three days.  Isaacson does a great job of showing not only the genius and visionary Steve Jobs but also the manipulative and verbally abusive Steve Jobs.  This book is not a glowing report on Jobs but rather an extremely honest look at the obessive control Jobs had to have over all faucets of his life.  The book does not go into a lot of technical detail on the products that Jobs invented over the years.  However it is rich on Jobs interaction with all the people in his life, from Bill Gates, to President Obama. It is not always a pretty picture and shows Jobs fallible side.  But in the end it is a fasicinating portrait of an inperfect genius.

Dwayne's dad (Fred Ward) has money which Dwayne believes he will inherit. A stripper(Bianca Kajlich) knows a hit man and suggests to him during a lap dance that he bump off his dad. The rub is that the hit man needs $100,000 first. So the duo decide to get the cash from a bank robbery which they will make someone else perform...such as our pizza boy. And of course nothing goes as planned as everything takes multiple comical twists.<br /><br />The movie had numerous LOL funny lines....&#34;Just like the Marines.

B005ELQVGW|4.0|This is a beautiful album, and a very beautiful concept. I have always been fascinated by space, so an album dedicated to it is just awesome. And coming from Bjork, it is even more awesome.  I don't know if its just me, but I absolutely fell in love with this album the first time my roommate played it. It reminds me a bit of Medulla in that it is not exactly pop-sounding. The most pop sounding songs you'll find here are Crystalline and Virus (a really beautiful love song, that will seem kinda creepy once you realize what its really about).  The rest of it is just her way of trying to put the epicness of this universe into sounds.  This album seems to have way less musical backings, but I think that it's fine because it gives Bjork's voice the chance to shine throughout the whole album (as in Desired Constellation). You also appreciate the subtlety of the music more because it's not drowned out by other instruments, so even the most subtle differences stand out from each other.  Still, there are some songs that do nothing for me at all (like Solstice), and sometimes the best parts of a song last for a short time (like Mutual Core's ending or Crystalline's).  Nevertheless, this is an amazing album. If you're more into Bjork's older, poppy work than the more experimental side, then you may not enjoy this album as much. But if you welcome experimentation - like \\"Medulla\\"  experimentation - this is for you. It's certainly not as out-there as that album is, but it is way better.  Favorite songs:  -Mutual Core  -Crystalline  -Virus
B004EPZ084|1.0|You see, Mark Zuckerberg and his crew wanted to keep things simple and amicable on facebook consequently not giving us the option of a 'Don't Like' Button...To that end, in order to communicate or display your displeasure with something in passing without issuing a comment is to ignore it...I guess in the final analysis this is the best course to take as it would eliminate cat fights and flames which occur on a regular basis anyways.<br /><br />But, I reiterate, But...if ever there were a need for the 'Don't Like' button it would be for the movie: Horrible Bosses. A real stinker of the highest order and a film that really had no reason to be made except for the money.  Senator Jay Bulworth could not have said it better:<br /><br />\\"Ya know, you make violent films and you make dirty films and ya make, you know, family films.  But, just most of 'em are not very good are they?  It's funny, so many smart people could work so hard on 'em and spend all that money on 'em and make all that money on them.  I mean, what do you think it is...it must be the money, huh?  It must be the money...it just turns everything to crap\\"...I rest my case.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Okay, we love or hate Michael Moore. Roger and Me was a classic and Sicko may be the second best of his films. He takes the viewer on a worldwide journey to see the various healthcare systems for the masses in France, Canada and even Cuba. Then, he contrasts these socialized systems with the USA and makes some valid points. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the worldwide healthcare access problem, but we need people like Moore to cast a bright light on the problem and possible solutions. He accomplishes this task--with humor of course--and Sicko is well-worth seeing and sharing with others interested in learning about healthcare systems beyond our borders.<br /><br />Mark Elliott Miller, MPH<br />University of Phoenix-San Amtonio, TX<br />Adjunct Faculty

B001TAJGO6|5.0|I just watched this film for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it.  If I were recommending the movie to a friend, I would probably say, \\"You will likely either love it or hate it.  It's not a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, and if you prefer linear stories, you probably won't like it.\\"  In its \\"either/or\\" spirit, it reminds me of a film I saw in the sixties, \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye.\\"  Based on Carson McCuller's novel, it starred Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Julie Harris, and Brian Keith.  I saw it in a theater in a mid-sized southern city.  About a third of the audience members got up and left the theater, mumbling, \\"I can't take this kind of s_ _ _.\\"  Those of us who stayed enjoyed it - a lot.  Over the years, \\"Reflections\\" has won much praise from film critics, yet few people have seen it.  I've watched the movie four times, I think.  Each time, I admire it more.  This film is a totally different animal, but has many of the same attributes and polarizing characteristics.  It entertained me, made me smile, made me think.  The characters are perfectly cast, including the \\"doctor's\\" wife.    Anyone who has been adventurous in relationships can especially relate to it.

I definately would NOT have spent nearly $20 on such a little toy.  I was very disappointed in the size of it but I'm sure she will still like it and play with it.  just be forwarned that it is only about 2 1/2 inches tall the measurments provided lead me to believe that it would be much bigger!!!  otherwise it is exactly what it looks like!!
B003NFM3JK|3.0|This film has been completely rendered in CGI.  As such it has some advantages over, and yet alternatively suffers when compared to, the best live action dramas.  In addition, this production cannot seem to decide whether it is to be a dark yet faithful adaptation of Dickens' work, or a pratfall-strewn, cartoon comedy.  With feet in both camps, it ends up unsuccessful in each.  There can be no question that CGI can offer a lot to enhance such a costume drama.  Every inanimate object was rendered faithfully and sometimes astonishingly.  The city of London in the 19th century was wonderfully presented.  The filming of Spirits and other spectral events can be greatly enhanced by CGI effects.  But ultimately it is the characters that sell the story.  The animated people in this production looked waxy and unrealistic.  Facial expressions lacked the sublime subtlety of reality.  Eyes were glassy and expressionless resembling audio-animatronic figures more than real human beings.  Things were not helped by the screenwriters' inability to come to grips with how they wanted to tell the story.  The pratfalls and comic chases clashed alarmingly with the dark and creepy aspects of the rest of the story.  Much of the film was a straight telling of Dickens' tale and was obviously well-researched as many details provided in the novella were accurately rendered.  Yet in its schizophrenia, the film also chooses at times to dispense with any effort at accuracy or even verisimilitude by inserting ridiculous scenes of cartoon-like quality.  If one wants a satisfying cartoon version of the Dickens tale, both amusing and touching, one need only view Disney's \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol\\".  In short, while at times quite accurate, its deficiencies make it difficult to recommend this film as the most accurate filmic representation of Dickens.

B005WTR4ZI|3.0|This book challenges the idea that rising productivity is the engine of increasing standards of living and wealth. Increases in productivity are said to elevate the standard of living in three ways:  1. Increased productivity causes prices to fall, thereby increasing workers' purchasing power. Because labor is 70% of the purchase price of most products, reducing labor lowers costs.  2. The people who are put out of work by increased productivity in the old industries will be forced to seek employment in new industries. A free market economy will allocate labor and capital to its most efficient uses. Surplus labor and capital that results from improving productivity in one industry will cause labor and capital to migrate to labor-short and capital-short industries in other sectors of the economy, including those based on new technologies. Productivity in old industries spurs development of new industries.  3. Increasing productivity causes wages to increase. For example, in a machine shop several machinists earning $25 an hour might be put out of work by a computerized lathe. However, an engineer earning $70 an hour has to be hired to program the computerized lathe.  Other skilled laborers will be hired to construct the computerized lathe. Thus, the workers who lose their jobs to automation are replaced by higher paid workers building and operating productivity enhancing equipment.  But is the theory correct? After all, every major financial collapse has occurred during times of rapidly increasing productivity:  * During the post-Civil War boom of the 1870s through 1890s the country developed an efficient economy based on the railroads' creation of national markets and national economies of scales. The result was the Depression of 1894-1897 when the military had to be called out to suppress anarchy by rioting mobs of unemployed and the country endured a real threat of a civil war between Labor and Capital.  * During the 1920s the productivity of modern mass production churned out millions of autos, radios, consumer appliances, and a new infrastructure based on highways and electric power plants This was followed by the Great Depression.  * During the 1980s and 1990s productivity was increased by advancing information and communications technologies. This has resulted in the massive unemployment that followed the &#34;Y2K&#34; collapse.  Today there is more productivity and less employment in the USA than in decades.  During each of these occasions the economy failed as agriculture, trade, and industry shut down and threw tens of millions out of employment. There was a real fear that all institutions of civilization including banking, business, and the government itself would fail. So how can productivity be good if it puts so many people at risk of unemployment starvation? This paradox of stupendously productive economies pauperizing the entire population has been discussed at least since the 1879 when the book PROGRESS AND POVERTY was published. Now 130 years later we're still talking about it.  The hallmark of a depression is a factory of stupendous productivity that stands idle because the people put out of work by productive-enhancing machinery no loner have money to purchase the products that it produces. How do we reconcile between the diametrically opposing theory that productivity creates jobs vs. the historical and anecdotal evidence that productivity destroys them?  The authors answer this question in CHAPTER 4. WHAT IS TO BE DONE? PRESCRIPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  Their recommendations are:  * Invest more in education. Pay teachers more money. Make teachers more accountable by paying them for performance, not tenure.  * Increase the H1B program. Bring more skilled workers in here from overseas, the idea being that skilled workers create synergies when they work with each other.  * Teach entrepreneurship broadly as a necessary life-skill, not just in elite business schools.  * Invest in more infrastructure, improvinghighways and communications.  * Increase government spending on basic research in the health and sciences.  * Lower taxes and regulations on business, so as to increase their incentives to hire.  * Make labor cheaper by eliminating social security taxes. Nationalize healthcare so that companies don't have to pay for it.  * Reform the patent system so that it is easier to file patents.  The authors' apolitical agenda that will appeal to both Conservative Republicans and Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrats will like the idea of paying teachers more money. Conservatives will like the idea of holding them accountable for performance. Liberals will like the idea of spending more money on hiring their unionized friends to upgrade infrastructure. Conservatives will like the idea of lowering taxes on business and  allowing them to hire cheap labor.  However, the agenda is contradictory. Spending more government money on education and infrastructure can't happen unless taxes are INCREASED. Social Security and national healthcare can't be maintained if payroll taxes are eliminated. The authors are advocating a low-wage agenda to encourage more hiring. How are employees going to pay taxes if they're working at minimum wage?  the book made me wonder if we should not take the DIRECT approach of mitigating the effects of productivity displacing workers beyond the rate at which the economy can reemploy them?  * Productivity improves the standard of living so long as it is implemented slowly. The normal attrition rate in employment is about 3% a year as employees retire from the workforce. Productivity improvement enhances employment as long as it puts fewer than 3% of people out of work each year.  When productivity improvements put more than 3% of the people out of work the economy will falter. To carry this example to an extreme, suppose it were possible for one machine operated by one employee to produce all the goods and services that are currently produced. In that event we'd have one person working and 150 million unemployed. The economy would fail.  * Productivity increases augment the economy when WORKERS SHARE THE VALUE  OF THE INCREASE. Workers should receive pay raises when their productivity increases. However, this is not the usual case. Productivity often puts people out of work entirely, lowering their pay to zero. A person with no income can't afford to buy any products, no matter how efficiently they are produced.  The Great Depression of the 1930s educated the country to the dangers of productivity being misused to destroy employment. FDR's New Deal was oriented toward reducing productivity by exempting companies from anti-trust laws if they agreed to recognize labor unions. Companies were allowed to engage in price-fixing cartels whereby prices were inflated in return for allowing unions to subdivide jobs so as to decrease productivity. This anti-productivity program restored profitability to business and improved wages for labor. The minimum wage was also imposed to induce companies to pass on more of the value of their production to their laborers. These measures restored the balance between capital and labor and set us up for the post-World War II economic boom.  Productivity improvements grow the economy when they benefit labor as well as capital. Perhaps our problem now is that productivity disproportionately increases the wealth invested in capital, while labor is experiencing diminishing wealth as employment opportunities decrease and wages fall.as one can find pointed on it its February 2011 issue \\"Our way or Norway\\" that Norway has a minimum wage of around $20 an hour as well as laws that encourage companies to maintain employment.  Norway supposedly has more entrepreneurs per capita than we do, so the higher minimum wage and employee- protections in the law may be more constructive than is generally believed.<br /><br />2. Discouraging companies from laying people off. Perhaps companies that use productivity-enhancing techniques as a vehicle for laying off their employees should pay penalties and excise taxes to pay for the unemployment that burdens the rest of us. If companies had to pay the true cost of the unemployment they create they would be forced to limit the implementation of productivity-enhancing equipment to 3% a year. They would be encouraged to retrain employees instead of dumping them on the street.<br /><br />Productivity improvements only grow the economy when they benefit LABOR as well as CAPITAL. Perhaps our problem now is that productivity increases almost exclusively benefit capital at the expense of labor. CAPITAL is garnering an increasing share of the nation's wealth accruing as profits while LABOR is experiencing diminishing wealth as employment opportunities decrease and wages fall. The book made me wonder if perhaps we should enact legislation to bring labor and capital into balance by limiting companies' ability to use productivity-enhancing technologies to put people out of work.wages fall. Let's enact legislation to bring labor and capital into balance by limiting companies' ability to use productivity-enhancing technologies to put people out of work.

You were with him in those pages, you could feel his playfulness, his genius, and his beliefs all in turn, be it in a Unified Theory or in pacifism--only to have those beliefs challenged by quantum and WW2.  You felt Einstein, you were beside him, you understood him.<br /><br />I don't think Isaacson has managed this here.<br /><br />There are moments of Steve Jobs but for most of it we're left with an enigma.  Indeed, for a work that had access to the subject in interview it's rather amazing that the majority of it does not rest with Jobs' view of the world but instead was stories told of others about Jobs.  Why is Jobs the way he is?  This question is never really answered.<br /><br />There are bursts of insight and guesses directly from Isaacson about simplicity and abandonment but we never dig deep in these pages.<br /><br />Besides this huge problem, there were other smaller ones.  Along with not focusing on Jobs' point-of-view, the book often strayed to the story of those around him and became sidetracked by the creation of Apple products from the Mac to the iPad.  Usually this is a technique to help explain the subject but here it only feels as if Isaacson was trying to fill out pages.  He also does this through repetition of stories and facts (and crying and screaming galore), which gets annoying for the reader and makes one wonder if this novel was rushed through the editing phase.<br /><br />Reading this, I can say I now know Apple, but I can't say I know Steve Jobs.  Linked as they are, they aren't one and the same.<br /><br />Not as dry as \\"Benjamin Franklin\\" yet not as impactful as \\"Einstein\\", three and a half stars.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|t may be hard for these guys to top their previous album, Viva la Vida, which I consider to still be their best effort yet. However, this is still a top-notch Coldplay album and one that any Coldplay or popular music fan would be wise to add to their collection. It's purportedly a concept album about life and relationships but it doesn't feel like it has the same over-arching theme that other albums have, say, such as last year's Grammy-winner, \\"The Suburbs\\" by Arcade Fire.<br /><br />The blogosphere has ripped the album up a bit, calling them U2 clones and pouncing on Chris Martin's lyrics. As both a U2 and Coldplay fan, I see it differently. I think the lyrics may have taken a step back from previous work but are still relevant to the theme of the album and comparable to recent Coldplay work. Johnny Buckland's high-pitched guitar riffs are far more prevalent on this album than in the past and he comes off as the MVP of this effort, especially with his work on \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\" and \\"Charlie Brown\\". \\"Charlie Brown\\" is my favorite of the new songs followed closely by \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\", which are just two of many arena-sized songs that make up at least half of the album.<br /><br />Lately, Coldplay's moved away from some of the moving piano ballads such as \\"The Scientist\\" but \\"Us Against the World\\" and short-but-sweet \\"UFO\\" actually serve as nice pace-changers in an otherwise throbbing album. Coldplay moves their music just a bit forward with this release, as evidenced by thumping single \\"Paradise\\" and the addition of Rhianna on \\"Princess of China\\", both of which will throw long-time Coldplay fans into a temporary tizzy. However, Coldplay's apparent admiration for hip-hop plays well in the overall context of the album and just takes some getting used to. The underlying Coldplay melodies are still there underneath the layers of electronics.<br /><br />The main sticking point for me is the three instrumental tracks that are essentially serve as long introductions to \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\", \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\", and \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\". I would have preferred that they just included them with each of the songs rather than having them as separate tracks since they can make for an awkward playlist when shuffling all the songs of this album or all of one's Coldplay songs in general. Finale \\"Up with the Birds\\" is almost two songs different songs in one, and I have to admit that I programmed my music player to skip the first half of the song so that I always finish with the upbeat second half. It's also the one point on the album where Coldplay deviates from some of the tougher aspects of relationships in general as the band seemed to feel that the album had to end happily.

0307593312|4.0|There's no denying that Haruki Murakami's 1Q84, which weighs in at 900+ pages, is an impressive achievement, both for its already accomplished author and for the two separate translators who took on the not inconsequential task of translating the book from Murakami's native Japanese into English. Equally impressive is the author's facility at working in this long form --- the story moves, it seems, effortlessly through hundreds of pages, and the reader, too, glides easily from page to page as if the book were a third of its length (although anyone lugging the hardcover version around in a backpack all day might quibble with any comments about the book's ease of use).  The story is told consistently through two separate viewpoints: those of Aomame and of Tengo. At first, readers are unsure what, if any, connection exists between the two of them; as the novel progresses, however, we learn that they share a past and possibly even an uncertain, chaotic, and dangerous present and future.  It all starts when Aomame, on her way to a business appointment of sorts, decides to walk down the highway embankment rather than remain a captive in a taxi during a huge traffic jam. Her cabbie, who seems to have a philosophical bent, gives her some puzzling parting words: \\"The everyday look of things might seem to change a little. Things may look different to you than they did before. I've had that experience myself. But don't let appearances fool you. There's always only one reality.\\" What Aomame encounters after she leaves the taxi and sets out on foot has her remembering the cab driver's words hours, days, even months later. The world surrounding her appears the same, but also different: people are abuzz about recent news events of which Aomame has no recollection, the police officers wear different uniforms and carry bigger guns, and --- most alarmingly of all --- two moons hang in the night sky.  Meanwhile, Tengo, a mathematics teacher and aspiring novelist, takes a little longerto develop a sensitivity to this new way of the world. He is caught up in a fraud of sorts: rewriting the text of a startlingly original but unpolished novel written by a taciturn young woman known as Fuka-Eri. As Tengo grudgingly participates in this massive deceit, he comes to realize not only that his participation in this project has far greater implications than he could have imagined, but also that Fuka-Eri herself is not precisely what she seems.  Soon, both Aomame and Tengo are coming at a particularly disturbing and dangerous challenge from two different angles, taking trajectories that may or may not intersect or even collide. Religious cults, abuse, violence, vengeance, forgiveness and love are at the heart of their story, but so is the process of storytelling itself, an act that involves both risk and reward.  Murakami's prose style may be an acquired taste, and chances are, if readers haven't developed a taste for his dispassionate, even chilly prose by the time they reach page 600, they probably never will. Murakami writes about intensely emotional subjects --- sex, child abuse, zealotry, murder --- with a kind of detachment that borders on numbness. His prose is both so cool and so confident and convincing that readers are likely to find themselves settling into it --- and its accompanying worldview and world-building --- without even thinking about the emotional and ethical implications until later.  What's most remarkable about Murakami's novel, however, is neither its prose style nor its accompanying emotional distance: it's its scope. Most so-called doorstopper novels contain multitudes of characters, conflicts, decades, or even footnotes. 1Q84, at its heart, is primarily a story of two separated lovers. It takes place in a short time frame and in a single city, but it's enriched by Murakami's philosophical musings and his uniquely visionary form of fantasy.  Reviewed by Norah Piehl

0385535139|5.0|A John Grisham bestseller is as expected as the turning of leaves in autumn. The Mississippi attorney has sold more than 250 million copies of his books, and each new one is eagerly anticipated by avid fans of courtroom fiction. Grisham's last novel, THE CONFESSION, was recently recognized by the American Bar Association and the University of Alabama Law School, who awarded him its first Harper Lee Prize for Legal Fiction. One of Grisham's endearing qualities as a writer is his unending ability to avoid formula novels. He writes riveting fiction that also speaks to important and contemporary legal issues. A collection of his writing could easily serve as a foundation for a law school course on great legal issues.  THE LITIGATORS is Grisham's latest novel, and once again he shows a willingness to take on an important legal issue. In addition, he spreads his wings outside of his beloved South or Washington, D.C., to situate the book in Chicago, a venue that many of his readers may find surprising.  The title refers to Oscar Finley and Wally Figg, an odd couple of the legal profession who are the sole members of the \\"boutique\\" Chicago law firm Finley & Figg. Actually, the term \\"boutique\\" is an exaggeration of epic proportion. But things change when the firm acquires substantial cachet with the hiring of David Zinc, a Harvard law graduate. The circumstances behind this arrival are in keeping with Finley & Figg's style. Zinc joins after experiencing five years of burnout associate work at the giant Chicago law firm of Rogan Rothberg. Arriving there one morning, Zinc can no longer accept the grind of 80-hour work weeks. While riding the elevator to his office, he experiences a breakdown and detours to a tavern around the corner. Twelve hours later, after a plethora of cocktails, he finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. The next day, he signs on as its only associate.  As noted, Grisham's novels are no longer just suspense-packed adventures. He now uses the pages of his bestsellers as a pulpit for commentary on contemporary legal issues. THE CONFESSION was a sermon against the death penalty, and THE APPEAL was a homily against the evil of an American legal system spending millions on the election of judges. The lecture subject of THE LITIGATORS is mass tort litigation, a system that makes millionaires out of lawyers on both sides of the legal battle but does little to compensate the actual victims. Readers are probably familiar with one of the cornerstones of this type of litigation: national appeals to potential plaintiffs through advertisements on television, radio or newspapers. In THE LITIGATORS, the culprit is Krayoxx, an anti-cholesterol drug that may be causing heart attacks and strokes.  Along the way, Grisham paints a portrait of a legal system run amuck. Readers will ponder how much of the portrayal is truth and how much is literary license. Everyone knows about the Gulfstream jets, the lavish meetings and the exorbitant fees. Taped phone calls and assembly line medical practices seem to be somewhat over the top, but Grisham's track record lends credence to these seemingly hyperbolic descriptions.  The contrast between the scheming lawyers and the honest fighter, in this case David Zinc, is a Grisham staple. While the mass tort lawyers cut corners and scheme, Zinc methodically investigates the injury to a young Burmese boy. He must build his lawsuit at great cost. Clearly, Zinc is the lawyer Grisham admires and respects. He is the honest attorney of the novel, who loses and then regains his respect for the law and for justice.  THE LITIGATORS is standard Grisham fare. It telegraphs much of the plot but remains an enjoyable and entertaining novel that points out the foibles of the justice system from top to bottom. As a nation we love the law, warts and all. Anyone watching television or reading newspapers or books can plainly see our fascination. Grisham has certainly used that interest in the legal system to great advantage. The law has given him fertile fields to cultivate, and we eagerly await the harvest of his next novel.

1400069181|1.0|While I appreciate the author's good intentions of making a positive impact via private initiatives and his passion; I can hardly endorse a very broken, irresponsible and oxymoronic model of \\"profitable-charity\\" that has done much harm and destruction under the guise of altruism and responsible consumerism.<br /><br />Let me explain...<br />Business model: Launch a private initiative by sourcing production from a cheap, labor rich country; market those goods to first-world consumers under the banner of serving the poor and a 1-to-1 model of putting shoes on the feet of impoverished children - therein saving their lives; lastly, market your company as if it is not-for-profit - unmotivated by margins - strictly focused on saving lives and addressing poverty in the 21st century.<br /><br />Why this is flawed: This is an initiative that has a great marketing strategy, coupled with an incredibly flawed and destructive business model. While selling merchandise (shoes in this case) that are extremely marked up, under the guise of serving the poor in another country, TOM's has convinced its consumers that you can be both trendy and a responsible consumer. The only problem is that TOM's built its model on a marketing plan aka what would sell (developed world), as opposed to a responsible understanding of the need (the developing world). Forced to honor its commitment to it's 1-to-1 policy, TOM's has dumped thousands of its shoes on the open markets of developing countries, driving hundreds of native companies out of business. In fact, TOM's has most often done far more harm than good, and all while making a tremendous amount of profit as a high-margin enterprise.<br /><br />A different approach: Blake should consider purchasing his shoes and other resources from the companies that he is driving out of business. While American shoes may be made of canvas in Argentina, most models that are distributed in developing countries are sourced in countries like China and Vietnam; therefore, he should present transparency in his supply chains, and seek to transfer his purchasing (and profits) to companies that are sourced in the very countries where he is distributing shoes - rather than undermining the few thriving private initiatives in the very regions he seeks to help. This model of charity (or in this case, \\"profitable charity\\") is BROKEN, and the fact that Blake has found a way to fund it through a marketing campaign that cloaks his enterprise as a \\"responsible, informed, alternative approach to consumerism\\" is detestable.<br /><br />But enjoy the book, drink the kool-aid, and live on a yacht if it makes you feel more responsible - apparently it's the cool thing to do.ency in his supply chains, and seek to transfer his purchasing (and profits) to companies that are sourced in the very countries where he is distributing shoes - rather than undermining the few thriving private initiatives in the very regions he seeks to help.

There is endless customization to all your characters classes and you can switch and learn new skills while retaining wat you have already learned.  Skill points can be adjusted at any time to fit your character how you want it.  One thing is recommended that you save when you get a chance because there is no auto-save even  though it does ask you if you want to save before exiting.

0439023521|5.0|Some books are best savoured slowly, reading a chapter every day on the commute to and from work, pondering all the possible directions the story might take. The Hunger Games is not one of those books. It is a book that needs to be devoured, preferably in one sitting. I started reading it on a Friday night, read late into the evening, woke up and continued reading on Saturday. I was actually annoyed that I had a birthday dinner for me and my dad that night, because all I wanted to do was keep reading. I finished it that Sunday, postponing things like doing the washing and the grocery shopping and writing my Sunday night blog post just so I could reach that final page.<br /><br />Why is The Hunger Games so addictive? For me, it was the brutal-yet-fascinating plot. Quite frequently, I felt sick with anticipation and concern as I sped through the scenes, wondering how Katniss was going to escape alive. And as the story developed, I became attached to other characters competing in the Games - which just made it even worse. With only one competitor allowed to live, people I cared about were going to die no matter what - it doesn't get any more gripping than that.<br /><br />The writing style - first person, present tense - added to the immediacy of the story as you see every horrific event unfold in real time through Katniss's eyes. You also get to hear her thoughts, which are often very different to the persona she portrays to the watchful cameras of the Capitol. I know a lot of people don't like present tense, but I love it and felt it suited this story perfectly.<br /><br />Katniss is one hell of a main character. She epitomises the word `heroine', with her courage, perseverance and resourcefulness. But while I marvelled at her strengths, I was simultaneously shaking my head at her emotional ineptitude. This only served to make her more realistic - we all have flaws, and growing up as a provider and protector in such a brutal world would no doubt take a toll on your emotional capacity.<br /><br />The Big Brother/reality TV element of this book was another compelling factor. For me, the `Games' were like Survivor crossed with Gladiator - to the death, on live TV. The prospect both sickened and fascinated me, and made me stop and question the direction our world is taking. Already, many of us live a voyeuristic life and sometimes I hear comments about reality TV contestants that make me wonder if the person has forgotten they're talking about a real human being.  I don't know where the trend towards reality TV will take us, but I truly hope (and thankfully doubt) it isn't anything close to what's presented in The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Apart from Katniss, the two characters I connected with the most were Peeta (the male competitor from Katniss's district) and Rue (the youngest contender in the Games). As a baker's son, Peeta comes from a more privileged background than Katniss. As a result, he doesn't have the same survival skills as she does, but his best asset is his pure heart. At twelve years old, Rue is easily the most vulnerable competitor but she has a hidden resourcefulness that was fascinating to discover. For fear of spoilers, I'm not going to say any more about either Peeta or Rue except that I truly enjoyed getting to know them.<br /><br />The only criticisms I have of this book are quite minor. One of the supporting characters, Effie Trinket, came across as two-dimensional throughout the entire book, which is never a good thing.  And... I would've liked more from the ending. I know, I know - it's a trilogy. but still, I'd hoped we might've received just a little bit more closure at the end of the first book. The main problem with this lack of resolution is I'm now itching to see what happens in books two and three when I already have a pile of books eagerly awaiting my attention (not to mention my own manuscript!).<br /><br />I have no doubt that I won't be able to resist the pull of this series for long. I just hope that when I do pick up book two, it's the first day of a long weekend so I can do nothing but read.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|...If you like your vampires moody, protective and wildly romantic, then this is the book for you...oh, dont forget a dash of evil vampire relatives,historical data, Da Vinci Code-esque mystery set in London and Salem with a side order of witches..Makes for a delightful read. Call it the Twilight for adults,or Sookie Stackhouse for sophisticates. The author weaves a top notch story that leaves one wanting more. I cant wait for the sequel.
B0052U59F4|5.0|First off let me just say that this book was WAY out of my element but, I heard great reviews so I gave it try. Four words can express my thoughts on this book I SIMPLY LOVED IT. Amazing characters, Ana and Christian captivated me with the rawness of their relationship and I found myself alternating between smiling and laughing and being jarred (that is the only word that fits  through the book! Sarcasm and Sweetness, Hard and Soft, Love and Hate, Toughness and Tenderness. All of these things wrapped up in one delectable read. RUN people, RUN to get a copy of this book and induldge yourselves. I promise you will not be disappointed! Ms. James, you are a genius!!!!!
0786891416|2.0|The new paperback book is crumpled in the back corner and the top of the front cover is bent. I am dissapointed as I am giving this as a gift.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|WOW, ok, where do I start? This book is haunting me!! Yes, I said haunting me. I finished, shut down my Kindle and sat for a good long time savoring all of the amazing facets of this book. I finally decided that I needed to do something else but, I can't stop thinking about Christian and Ana. I have gone back to my Kindle several times(I am acutally too embarrassed to say how many) just to re-read parts that have enraptured me. If that isn't a glowing review, I don't know what is.<br /><br />Ana is lost in her greif since her and Christian have parted ways, and the writing is so wonderful that you can feel what she is feeling and it is heart wrenching. When our HOT (and I do mean HOT) Christian decides to win her back, Ana just cannot turn him down and from there the story gets rolling! I mean rollercoaster rolling and I did not want to get off the ride. We are introduced to more characters that will affect both our hero and heroine in different ways. From a new boss to a couple of ex's that get a little too close for comfort for my tastes. (And Ana's too) In the end, it is Christian's mother Grace that is the one that does what I have wanted to do to a certain character since we first met her. All I can say is..WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? If you haven't met our Fifty, then do yourself a favor and go pick him up, read the First Book \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and then dive right in to \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\". I for one cannot wait for #3. Oh, Ms. James please hurry!
0792164903|4.0|The only problem I have with this film is the depiction of the Hessian.  His uniform is bizarre looking, and where does that sword come from?  Why couldn't they have had a faded looking old blue coat with yellow facings, black gaiters and a Grenadier cap which was very scary to raw American troops in the early part of the Revolution.  Why the weird looking outfit?<br /><br />The Hessians were feared and demonized somewhat in the early part of the Revolution and the film does show the fears that people had toward anything unusual.  I suppose the film might be showing how the head-less Hessian looked to those fearful of him, but I still would have preffered a more period, less fantastic look.  He also comes across as something of a vampire.<br /><br />I guess I should not expect too much historical accuracy for something like this from a Tim Burton production which is concerned more about atmosphere than anything else.  Other than this I found it to be a good, period horror flick. Fun for Holloween.  Even Depp, who comes across often as creepy and somewhat gay, was rather cute with his stylized acting.  I give it 4 stars instead of five because of the odd Hessian look.
B003LL3NOK|1.0|Forget this movie. It's less about zombies and more about two Irish half-wits having an island bitch fight with each other. I found the constant idiotic bickering really detracted from the movie and, if you left out the zombies altogether, this could have been a commentary on the problems in Ireland and why that country has not been able to get it's act together over the past several hundred years. If you want a straight up zombie flick, this is not for you at all.
1423140591|4.0|The newest offering from Rick Riordan, this time continuing his Heroes of Olympus series, delivers more exciting action, quirky humor and introduces even more excellent characters that fans of Riordan's work have come to love. Plus, there's the long-awaited return of Percy, everyone's favorite demigod, but this time, Percy is going over to the Roman side.<br /><br />Readers quickly learn that the Roman side is very different from the Greek one -more militant, more restrained and not seemingly as fun-loving. Percy, however, finds himself among unknown Roman demigods with a strange lack of memories. He soon finds himself friends with a new group of memorable demigods, including Frank, a son of Mars, and Hazel, a daughter of Pluto. Though Riordan's character development for these two new demigods isn't as vivid as in other Riordan works, Hazel is a big standout, with a unique personality and well-developed past. In fact, I had so much fun with Hazel that she may just be my new favorite Rick Riordan character.<br /><br />After teaming up with Hazel and Frank, Percy sets off on another quest, this time to Alaska to save Death himself and restore order to the human world. Though I found it somewhat odd that we lost Jason, Leo and Piper from The Lost Hero, Hazel and Frank were worthwhile replacements, and the opportunity to meet more demigods in Riordan's world was well worth it.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that Son of Neptune is the best Riordan novel, however, it did seem like somewhat of a re-tread of previous novels and, honestly, Riordan doesn't bring anything new to the table here, but he really doesn't need to. Riordan delivers another excellent and action-packed novel that fans will devour and desperately await the sequel.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It was one of the best books I have ever read. Best drama and well written book that will allow you to just read for weeks and weeks to come
0590030299|5.0|The Very Hungry Caterpillar is one of Eric Carle's children's book.  It is a counting book as well as the story of the life cycle of a butterfly.  The kids love the list of very silly things the caterpillar munches through.  Definitely one for the preschool set.
0307454541|5.0|I love this first book of the trilogy. I was so into it that i bought the other two right away. It's the best book ever!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Although this isn't one of the best books I've ever read, I definitely enjoyed reading it.  The story and setting were very different and I enjoyed that uniqueness.  I would say the story was engaging rather than riveting...I had no problem putting it down and coming back to it hours or days later to pick up where I left off.  The ending was a little vague and not as satisfying as I had hoped but all in all - I would recommend this book as a light read.
0385534639|5.0|I can't believe I'm so lucky to have found two gems this year, both in my October reading... It's such a magical month.  The books reminded me of old favorites: Paul Gallio's The Man Who Was Magic,  Clive Barkers' Ararat  and just about anything written by Ray Bradbury, but October Country comes to mind.  These two gems were: The Night Circus and Laini Taylor's Daughter of Smoke and Bone.  I refuse to write anything that might be a spoiler for either of these wonderful books and only suggest that if you found yourself moved by the books and authors I mentioned, please do give The Night Circus and Daughter of Smoke and Bone a try.
B00601J5CC|5.0|Wow!  What a show of scary characters.  Each and every character has a different angle.  And a character on television lambasting her mentally retarded daughter is one for a first.  I am sure that the ADA is going to have something to say about this.  But it happens in America where people rue and curse their own offspring when they are born disabled, and I am glad this was finally shown on television.  As with all horror films, the devilish characters such as this gay guy who belittles everyone is going to get his just revenge.  So I think that is what will happen in part II.
B0041KKYGU|4.0|I am really surprised by all the negative reviews here. This was funnier and not as vulgar as Horrible Bosses. Predictable all the way through but easy to watch and some good laugh-out-loud moments.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This is a family favorite here. My daughter has bought this series for her husband for each season. It is his favorite and because of his job he misses episodes. I bought this for his Christmas present this year. It makes for an easy gift choice that is always well received.
0307586901|5.0|This is a wonderful book if you are into DIY. Almost all of the projects have easy to follow instrucions and will add to any of your holiday fun.  There are crafts children can be involved in doing and materials are available at most craft shops.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I thought I was buying the game to it's fully updated state.  I feel like I purchased a game from 2011 and when I opened the package I got one from 1984. It's missing all of the adds I normally enjoy on my ipod and it really is disappointing that I paid the same amount for less.  If I could return this game, I would. If I would have known this from the beginning, I would've just waited until they put forth the updates with the mini games and zen garden.  Not worth it. At least not right now.
030788743X|5.0|In Ready Player One, Ernest Kline has meticulously created a vision of 2044 that is frighteningly realistic.  People live in large \\"stacks\\" of mobile homes.  The earth's environment has been mistreated and mostly ruined, the struggling economy provides jobs for only the lucky minority, and most people are left fighting for food coupons to survive. To escape their miserable existence, people log in to the Oasis, a virtual, on-line world that is peopled with attractive avatars and beautiful locations.  The book's action revolves around a game within the Oasis where the winner will inherit the huge fortune left by the heirless inventor of the Oasis, James Halliday.  Halliday, a lover of all things from the 1980s, loaded his game with all kinds of 1980s references, including music, movies, and, of course, video games.<br /><br />I grew up in the 1980s and spent some time playing on early video game systems, so I understood many of this book's 1980s references.  Such an understanding is not necessary to enjoy this book, but it certainly helps.  Ready Player One's primary action revolves around the game for Halliday's inheritance.  I was initially worried that I would be bored by this focus on a video game, but Kline manages to make the game very suspenseful and entertaining, even for someone who isn't a video game enthusiast.  In fact, this is the most entertaining book I've read in a long time.  The primary characters were well-developed and likeable.  I could've done without the love sub-plot (which was a bit cheesy), but I would still highly recommend this book.
B0055S348W|5.0|I love this app. Having the ability to print to the printers. I have it sent up at home to print to my printer, and also at my work to print to about 7 or 8 printers. It's great for printing e-mails or text messages, or pdfs or anything really. I would recommend this app
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I initially was not looking very forward to watching this since I'm quite wary of movies that go back in time as their setting.  However, after watching it, I probably must say that it is the best of the lot.  The Blu-ray surround sound was fantastic with and excellant score, almost classic Bondish. This is one movie I'm going to watch again and I can't say that about many movies.  In summary, unless you hate comic book based movies this is one of the better movies that has come out this year!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I got this app when it was amazon's free app of the day. I know there's many of these office style apps. But I think this one is probably my favorite and works best. Easy to use and lots of things it can do. I prefer this app way more to \\"quickoffice\\"
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Excellent recording.  I do enjoy the live versions of Smells Like Teen Spirit better than the recording though.  Wlecome to the Jungle is phenomenal and so is Smooth Criminal.  With or Without You is also a good listen.  The other songs are a bit slower and I was not as familiar with them.  These two guys are extremely talented and you can tell that they are having a good time doing what they are doing.  I look forward to more from 2cellos.
1466208686|5.0|I have been studying with this book and other books, preparing for tech interviews in all the big tech companies and I found this book to be the best resource for me for several reasons:   1. The book is the most up to date book in terms of technical questions - Each company I interviewed with, asked me at least 1 question from that book. So it was actually nice to impress my interviewers and tell them: \\"Oh, I know this question..\\". In some cases, I was able to use the questions from the book to come up with solutions to similar, yet different, questions I was asked. For example, there is a question in the book about finding whether an array contains two numbers which add to a given sum. I was asked in an interview: Find whether there are 3 numbers in a given array which sum to zero.   2. The book has a section about behavioral questions. It provides strategies on how to answer this type of questions. It seemed to me that all the behavioral questions I was asked during my interviews were taken from this book.   3. The book outlines a scheme (a block diagram) on how to prepare for tech interviews which was extremely helpful preparing for phone screens, interviews and onsite interview days.   4. If you interview with the big tech companies: Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Yahoo, you will find a section that discusses the interview process in those companies, what's unique to those companies and what you need to focus on when preparing - awesome!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen King was one of the first established writers to have his work published in e-book format. He published UR as an Amazon Kindle novella in 2009. Mile 81 is a Kindle Single published by Amazon this year, a terror story that takes place at a defunct rest area at mile marker 81 of Interstate 95.<br /><br />Mr. King returns to a topic he wrote about in a 1983 full length novel, Christine, the name of a 1958 Plymouth Fury with a terrible mind of its own. This time it is an old mud slathered station wagon, vaguely defined as a Ford or Chevy. It has a different mind than Christine that several characters discover at their peril.<br /><br />The prolific writer shows his talent for engaging the reader in the action and causing her to care about the characters. They are a random set of people in a variety of vehicles who pull off the highway where the station wagon is parked.  In his narrative, Mr. King introduces products and services current today that pull the reader into identification with the ordinary people driving on I-95 who make the bad decision to stop. For example, they eat brand name foods, drive well known vehicle models, use contemporary jargon, and talk about current events.  Mr. King has the unique talent to make the reader believe in the story and care about the realistic characters no matter how bizarre the premise of the work.<br /><br />This is a very good, satisfying novella for the reader offered by Kindle Singles publishers. It is well worth the very affordable price. The e-book also contains a teaser for Stephen King's new full length novel, 11/22/63.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|so far the first three books are the only ones that should be in this series. a few key plot points are mentioned in this book but the rest of the book is just a lead up for somethimg else to happen.. if you are paying more then ten bucks for this dont buy it
B005LAZIRY|5.0|I realize that this review is written very late after this album's release. I am just now getting the album on the morning of Halloween, and just finished my first listen through. This is partially due to skepticism on my part, as well as money issues. I won't get into the latter issue except for the fact that I'm a college student; but let's talk about Heritage, shall we? ;)<br /><br />I remember the very first time I ever heard Opeth, circa 2003/2004. I was in 8th grade at the time, and was going through a musical transition from MTV-friendly rock music to metal bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and eventually, Children of Bodom. Needless to say, at that point, I was all about heavy music, with very little regard for anything else, making me a very musically ignorant kid. I remember one day, when flipping through the Much Music channels on DirecTV, the title track from Opeth's \\"Deliverance\\" was playing on the metal channel. I was really impressed with the intro and Mikael's death growls; it was such an evil sound that I really liked. But then, the unthinkable happened... Acoustic guitars? A jazzy verse? Clean vocals? What the hell just happened? What was I listening to? I listened the whole way through, and didn't know what to think of it at that point. Later, when I was a freshman in high school, one of my older brother's friends let him borrow a copy of the album. I remembered how puzzled I was with the title track, so I was very skeptical to hear the entire album. However, when I listened through for the first time, I forgot about everything I had thought before, and all of my doubts went away. That album definitely had an impact on the way I listen to music in general, and gave me a new appreciation for non-metal music. Needless to say, I have been a big Opeth fan ever since.<br /><br />Now, just a little short of a decade later, I sit here in my college dorm on Halloween morning listening to \\"Heritage.\\" While I still consider myself a metalhead at heart, my musical taste today is very messy (in a good way). I can jam to anything from black metal, dubstep, jazz, and Celtic music, for instance. In recent months, I have particularly been experimenting with Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson's solo work, and am diving deeper into progressive rock as a result. However, I shamefully admit that I was a little hesitant to buy Opeth's \\"Heritage.\\" While I really liked what I heard from \\"The Devil's Orchard\\" on YouTube, I didn't know whether this would be one of those albums where only one song stands out from the rest or not. But after giving it a full listen, much like with \\"Deliverance,\\" any doubt I had before is dead and gone.<br /><br />Because I'm just now listening to the album, I can't point out any particular parts, but there were times when I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow in surprise. I won't mention much about the album itself in detail, since many other reviewers have already summed it up better than I can. I've read many reviews on this album though, and like one mentioned here in an earlier post, there is a division among fans (ie: the die-hard metalheads and the general music lovers). I, for one, feel like I fall somewhere in between die-hard metalhead and general music lover. I still listen to bands like Obscura, Wintersun, Ensiferum, Enslaved, Gojira, etc, but I love other genres outside of metal as well, as mentioned above. So for me, \\"Heritage\\" is a very enjoyable album. I would not deem it as a \\"metal\\" album by any means (though there are \\"metal moments\\" throughout). \\"Heritage\\" clearly isn't for everyone, but if you love everything that Opeth has done up to this point and are willing to give something new a try, I would definitely recommend this album. Anyone who loves Porcupine Tree or Steven Wilson's solo work may be more prone to love it as well.<br /><br />I hope this review helps. Cheers!e today is very messy (in a good way).

B005IZLPME|2.0|I was so excited to see this, but was SO disappointed.  The writing and plot are just terrible.  The story isn't well-told, so you end up not caring about Captain America or the Red Skull or ANYTHING at all!!!  I LOOKS good - good effects and some action and stuff.  And I liked the touches of the old Captain suit and good ol' Stan Lee's cameo.  But for the most part, I couldn't wait for it to be over.  I thought it was terrible.
0790744473|4.0|Worth seeing for the GREAT DANCING GENIUS of Gene Kelly, and not to forget Cyd Charisse.  The idea of a charming and romance-ready antique village  that appears and disappears in time would seem to offer great material for an enjoyable musical, but for some reason (which I can't figure out) this story about finding an ideal true love beyond the selfish deficiencies of the real, cosmopolitan world of the big city was not as successful as it should have been.  (One LITTLE thing that I know I distinctly disliked was the lime-yellow color used in the costume schemes.)
B005VW4Q70|5.0|I may just be me, but that kind of music rocks. During the show, it makes you want to stand up and dance!:D
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|I've got love for any film that'll showcase Spandau Ballet, and SKY HIGH is pretty generous in showcasing one of my childhood anthems, \\"True.\\" Besides, SKY HIGH is worth many repeat viewings. As I recall, this offering from Walt Disney Pictures demonstrated strong legs at the box office. And why not? It is hugely entertaining. For Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano), peer pressure is a mother and he's not at all looking forward to this year's first day of school. Will Stronghold is the third generation child of a family of superheroes. His parents are Steve (Kurt Russell) and Josie (Kelly Preston), successful real estate brokers... who also happen to be the world's greatest caped crusaders, the invincible Commander and Jetstream, mistress of super-sonic flight and unarmed combat. Will is enrolled in Sky High, a hi-tech learning establishment ideal for molding tomorrow's super-powered crime fighters. Sky HIgh is his parents' alma mater. So expectations are off the charts.<br /><br />Will isn't about to tell his parents that he doesn't have any superpowers, that he's either a late bloomer or maybe even a never-was.<br /><br />Sky High is \\"kept aloft by the latest in anti-gravitional propulsion,\\" meaning that this unusual academy is accessed by a rocket-propelled school bus. The students all have some sort of special ability but, other than that, Sky High is like any other school. There are cliques and social politics and acne and teen angst and awkwardness. Will Stronghold's first day is pretty sad, especially when the \\"power placement\\" session - which determines whether you're a \\"hero\\" or a \\"sidekick\\" - swings around and Will arrives at the moment he'd been dreading, exhibiting his lack of powers. A dumbfounded Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell, more abrasive than the Sorting Hat) promptly labels him a sidekick and designates him to Hero Support, a course taught by the now middle-aged All-American Boy, who used to be the Commander's sidekick. Mr. Boy is terrifically played by Dave Foley.<br /><br />Michael Angarano doesn't at all look like a teenaged pin-up model, and this lends an immediate appeal and a realness to his role. You like him even when he pulls those bonehead slip-ups. In Hero Support, Will ends up hanging out with a shabby bunch of sidekicks so dubiously powered even the Legion of Substitute Heroes bully them for lunch money. There's a guy who glows (a hilarious Nicholas Braun). Another guy who melts into a puddle. A girl who shapeshifts into a guinea pig. The only one with serious powers is Will's best friend, Layla, who can manipulate plant life. Except that Layla, deeming the hero-sidekick system to be unfair, refused to demonstrate her talent. Ergo, sidekick.<br /><br />What's school without an unattainable crush? Will quickly falls for Sky High's most popular girl (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He also gets the stink eye from another freshman, the incendiary Warren Peace (Steven Strait), son of a hero and a super-villain (except that this super-villain parent used to be one of the Commander's foes).<br /><br />There are clever bits and, thankfully, not too many contrived bits. I love the scenes in the Hero Support class. The big bad's true nature caught me by surprise. Tonally, SKY HIGH tilts towards the lighthearted. Even the superhero action sequences are laden with humor, although that doesn't take away from the spectacle of the fighty fights. Thru character development and a solid script, the story allows you to get to know these lovable underdogs. Another strength of the film is that the cast - consisting of teens and established actors - performs seamlessly as a whole. The school faculty is peppered with iconic figures. Cloris Leachman cameos as the X-ray powered school nurse. And, most awesomely, Lynda Carter plays Sky High's Principal Powers. And she is still gorgeous. Meanwhile, Kurt Russell, with this movie (his 11th big screen Disney release), takes over Dean Jones' longstanding spot as Disney's most featured live-action male lead. It makes you realize that Kurt Russell grew up in front of our eyes. I just watched THE COMPUTER WORE TENNIS SHOES a few weeks ago, and I can't help but think that, forty years ago, Kurt Russell would've been playing the Will Stronghold role, instead of the beaming dad. Correction, \\"beaming\\" dad until the Commander learns that his son's a sidekick. Who hears Spandau Ballet music. Still, it's another element to relish in this film, the father-son relationship between the Commander and Will Stronghold.<br /><br />The DVD's extras:<br /><br />- Alternate Opening - a flashback sequence set in 1985 featuring Jetstream, the Commander, and All-American Boy battling Royal Pain & Stitches (00:03:20 minutes)<br />- Super Bloopers (00:04:19 minutes long)<br />- \\"Breaking Down the Walls: The Stunts of SKY HIGH\\" (00:07:00)<br />- \\"Welcome to SKY HIGH\\" - A featurette which takes you behind the scenes with the cast & crew (00:15:18)<br />- Bowling for Soup's Music Video \\"I Melt With You\\"d live-action male lead.

B005JJSG44|5.0|This is an excellent item for every Peter fan.  I ordered mine thru his website and received it in mid October (the time it was released overseas).  It has fantastic photos along with the blu ray and standard definition DVD's of the concert.  There is also a studio CD and live CD of New Blood.  My only concern is that the 'Frequently Purchased Together' items are found all in this selection.  Doesn't seem to spend almost $30 more for individual items when you can save some money and get it in this Deluxe Import.  Any fan cannot go wrong with this purchase.
B005DZMODI|5.0|This is a fantastic CD by two amazing musicians. They are backed up by a great band and accompanied by  Taj Mahal. Anyone who loves the blues will love this album.
B005H0IW6W|1.0|Save your money and DO NOT purchase this album.  I was very disappointed with it. The way that he sang the songs were so monotone like he wasn't putting any effort into singing the songs. It was hard to make it through the whole CD. It  felt like he ruined many of the classic Christmas songs. All of the greats before him sang them so much better. I am going to check with anyone I know to see if they'd like to have the album. I have no plans to listen to it a 2nd time.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|I often enjoy genre movies like this in spite of the writing and acting, just because of some (hopefully) unique action sequences.  I seldom if ever watch movies like that more than once, though.  This one I want to own, because I expect to watch it again on my own and to show it to friends in the future.    This movie is very well-written, and it takes full advantage of the novel inner-city vs. aliens concept.  All of the characters are believable, and they respond to events in a way that feels like it comes from who they are rather than what the plot needs them to do.  Case in point: one of the main characters, a nurse, has to team up with a group of teenagers who mugged her at the beginning of the movie.  She does this because she has to, but she never just lets it slide that they committed a crime against her.  Most of the protagonists here are petty criminals who do unsympathetic things at times, but the movie gives them a chance to redeem themselves as characters without it seeming forced or schlocky.    I also like the fact that there are no throwaway characters here, even though some of them seem at first as if they're just there to set up a punchline or two.  By the climax of the movie, various elements click into place in a very satisfying way to make what happens next seem authentic.    Besides the writing, the other elements of this movie are also very polished.  The acting, the special effects, the camera work; even the soundtrack is memorable.  This is definitely worth at least a rental, and probably a buy as well.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I have been an Walt Disney collector for a long time. I am a grandmother of 24 grandchildren and a great grandmother of 2 and when they come and visit, my bedroom is the first place they go so that I can put in their favorite movie, I have played the Lion King 1/2 so much that they have wore it out, so I had to get this one to build back up my collection. My goddaughter loves the Lion King, I had to go an buy her one. I really did not need to know anything about the product or the purchased price. If you are an Walt Disney collector you know that these are the best movies any family should have young or old.
B0057R5G6E|2.0|TO BE CLEAR: the 2-STAR rating is for the collectors set, not the movies. Jurassic Park is an awesome movie & Jurassic Park: The Lost World a better than average sequel. The 3rd movie however was lame & to date I hadn't owned or intended to ever buy. But since all 3 came in the new Blu-ray Ultimate Set I went for it.    Bad move, I didn't look carefully enough at the photo's & thought that the disc would be contained in the Dinosour display; as with the Aliens Collector Set, alas no. Not only do the discs come in a separate case, it's a case without a closed top or bottom, so if you don't grab it firmly enough gravity will have all the movies on the floor.    The Dinosour model is also technologically lacking; they could have at least spent another 50 cents to have it roar of something, instead it's just a large paper weight.    When you factor in buying the 3rd movie that's only worth seeing once, it's just not worth it. Buy movies 1 & 2 on there own and you'll be good to go with more money left in your wallet.
B0036TGT3E|4.0|I bought this for my son as it was a favorite of mine growing up.  The first few scenes in the movie were in fantastic HD and the scenery jumped off the screen.  Unfortunately this wasn't the case for the whole movie and portions of the movie didn't seem to be as digitally remastered as you would expect for a Blu-Ray.  The story was the same good story and the movie wasn't too expensive.  Overall we enjoyed watching it and that was why we bought it.
B005IS565S|5.0|Awesome album from Five Finger Death Punch. A little softer but loses none of their typical attitude and swag. A lot more varied on the vocals in a good way. Ivan matures more in the vocals. I noticed a higher emphasis on the Bass guitar and I think it could be their best album if I get used to it like the past two.
159514188X|5.0|This book is worth reading. It really makes you think about how you treat people and how you look at them. I loved every sentence of it. I love that Clay took the time to listen to the tapes. Awesome book!!!! Everyone should read it.
0670034711|5.0|This book gave me the vocabulary to explain so many thoughts and feelings I had inside me. It's like Gilbert knows me! I think the movie has given people the impression that this some wishy washy chick flick love story but in reality this is a book with so much depth and soul. Millions could relate to Gilbert's experience.
1589946901|3.0|I wasn't expecting the card game to be more complex than the miniatures version but some how it is and I don't think in the good way. Still haven't players 3-4 person game so it might be better than 2 player. Takes a bit to set up, all the cards have different stacks and there are tokens that are random that would work better as cards.Each team wildly plays diffidently from each other, not that that's a bad thing but they might be unbalanced. All things considered if its just 2 players I think i'll stick to classic blood bowl.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I loved the musical numbers from the movie. The songs are energizing.  Christina Aguilera is incredibly talented. What a voice!It is greatfor livening up boring household chores.

B000002L9Y|4.0|On 1987's \\"Tango In The Night\\", #7, Fleetwood Mac had been off for 5 years, since 1982's  \\"Mirage\\" album.  Here Lindsey Buckingham gives us some great material  \\"Big Love\\", #5 hot 100, #23 AC  and #2 MSR,  \\"Caroline\\",  \\"You And I, Part II\\", \\"Family Man\\" #93 hot 100 and \\"Tango In The Night\\" #28 MSR, with one cool solo by Lindsey.  Christine McVie's material is top notch pop, \\"Everywhere\\" #14 hot 100, #22 MSR and #1 AC, \\"Mystified\\",  \\"Little Lies\\" #4 hot 100, #14 MSR, #1 AC,  and \\"Isn't Midnight\\" #14 MSR.  Stevie's \\"Seven Wonders\\" #19 hot 100 #2 MSR and #13 AC, this is the only song I could get into penned by her.  A very good album for 1987.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I'm not surprised at the excellence of this record, but I am a bit taken aback by the surprise shown by others that it should be as good as it is. Mr. Laurie has been involved with all sorts of music for a very long time. Back in the days of \\"A Bit of Fry & Laurie\\" he did spot-on parodies of musical genres, which is harder to do (and requires more musical acumen)- than you might think; plus which, he always closed the show as \\"Mr. Music.\\"  As House, of course, he's often seen playing the heck out of his piano.   I think Americans might have a hard time imagining performers having a variety of interests and/or talents. When actors do something on their own, it's looked on as just a \\"vanity project\\" (and often is just that).   For some reason, though, English actors in particular seem capable of dong more than one thing well. For example, Mr. Laurie has written a well-received novel too. His partner in comedy, Stephen Fry, has, of course, done just about everything (but that's another story altogether).  Anyway, from what I've heard of \\"Let Them Talk\\" both Mr. Laurie and his well-chosen team of musicians have all done themselves proud. If you love New Orleans music, you should really give it a listen.
B000000ORE|5.0|\\"Great Radio Controversy\\" (1989) #18.    Great hard rock music here, and a few nice peer ballads, there's plenty of meat and potatoes on this disc.  \\"Hang Tough\\" # 34 MSR, \\"Heaven's Trail (No Way Out)\\" #13 MSR, \\"Lazy Days, Crazy Nights\\", \\"Did It For Money\\", \\"The Way It Is\\" #55 hot 100 and #13 MSR, the ultimate classic \\"Love Song\\" #10 hot 100 and #7 MSR and \\"Party's Over\\".  Best Tesla album of theirs on the market.  Due for a re-master.  Out.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Netflix was why I purchased this product and it work great.  Shipment on time and looks like a quality adapter
B00008PW3Q|4.0|\\"Say You Will\\" (2003) #3.  First album by the band in 6 years, this time without long time member Christine McVie (they could of used her on a couple of tracks).  Lindsey Buckingham's material is excellent, Buckingham's songs would of made a great solo album!  We get from LB:  \\"What's The World Coming To\\", the hard driving \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\", about Edward R. Murrow an American broadcast journalist who proceeded over the McCarthy hearings in 1954. \\"Red Rover\\" some great guitar here, \\"Peacekeeper\\" #80 hot 100 and #10 AC, a great folk-rock tune.  \\"Come\\", Lindsey at his best, great song, psycho guitar solo, great stuff.  \\"Steal Your Heart\\", channels \\"Out Of The Cradle\\",  \\"Bleed To Love Her\\", Dynamite studio version here, and \\"Say Goodbye\\".  Stevie Nicks gave us 3 good songs \\"Illume 9/11\\", \\"Silver Girl\\" and \\"Say You Will\\" #17 AC, pure Fleetwood Mac pop.  This is their last album to this point, but rumors persist of an album by 2012 or 2013.

B0041KKYGA|3.0|With regard to the supposed \\"mystery\\" surrounding Shakespeare's identity, I would suggest reading [[ASIN:0300108281 The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, 1400-1580]] & [[ASIN:1586172247 The Quest for Shakespeare]], to gain an appreciation for the anti-Catholic world in which Shakespeare lived.  In the face of Catholics being murdered by the government, [[ASIN:1586172247 Joseph Pearce]] maintains that Shakespeare \\"would remain obedient to his king, his country, his faith, and his conscience, saying, through the medium of his plays, with Sir Thomas More...that he was the king's good servant, but God's first\\" (p. 150).

B005KJZDW6|5.0|For vinyl lovers: First of all, you get a free digital copy of this so don't even think twice about buying the vinyl version. Secondly, it comes on CLEAR RED VINYL. I don't know if the color is limited or not... Most likely it is so if you wanted the colored vinyl don't wait on this purchase. I haven't even listened to it but it gets 5 stars due to packaging and the aformentioned bonuses. Will update after I listen.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This film is a must see. It is all about CHARACTER--from every actor and from the celebrated horse as well. The film is so intelligently done and full of heart--with casting and performances that could NOT have been improved a bit--that at times you'll forget this is a movie and you'll cheer out loud and actually feel the intense pain and angst of the characters. I was so drawn into the story that I felt I was part of the time, part of the events, and the intensity was only heightened because the story is completely true and faithful to the record. One hopes that the character and caring so evident in these heroic people (even in the horse!) are present in our modern world.
B004WDX5P8|3.0|The purchase experience was excellent, but the movie itself was okay; it wasn't the greatest.  I expected to be more suspenseful.
1423140591|5.0|Loved the fast delivery!!! Perfect condition amising book Highly recomend it to all!!! I think its one of the best buys on amazon but please dont take my workd for it. Try it yourself!!! The kids will love ut especialy if they read Percy Jackson.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Like many artist struggling to output something as great as before whether by that artist or another, it pushes for the best.  Although stressful and nerverackingly frustrating... it usually breeds the best thing for that moment from that great artist. Introspection to metamorphism.<br /><br />I believe Pitchfork rates it their third or fourth or fifth best album because a few songs were misplaced or didn't fit at all on the album, which I think is ridiculous.  I know it's an impossible task to sort and rate the top 4 of their albums, but I give this one 5 stars, and call it 'their best album'. OK Comp was perfect for it's time, the Bends too; Amnesiac and Kid A were so special, but this one is just as timeless as those and personally has a few of my very favorite songs on it.<br /><br />A Masterpiece.<br /><br />BTW, I purchased this album when it came out and gave it away months later only to buy it again a year later and wonder what I was thinking.  I guess the ones that grow are the ones not ever to go..  for good that is.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Yes, I didn't realize I needed a blu ray for this.. Thought it would play on my regular dvd player, and was my 5 year old sooo sad when NOTHING happened.. So, out to Best Buy for a Samsung blu ray.. and back again... Now, I have seen all the originals, and yes, felt that the \\"elder Anikan ghost\\" should have been at the ending as the original was, but bottom line, it is a great set.. My kids love it, and frankly, they don't see the difference between the other releases and this one.. After seeing the price gouging going on for the earlier release DVD's, I could ONLY AFFORD this one, and even this was a stretch... well, that and having to buy a blu ray player.. It is too bad the discs are not more, \\"artsy decorated\\" like the other releases were.. kind of blah really. Could have had more of a product punch.  The other criticism is with AMAZON PACKAGING.. the box came DENTED.. it was lamely \\"wrapped,\\" or should I say, \\"unwrapped.\\" Sad to say but the quality of Amazon shipping has gone way down since they first opened for business.  Don't cut corners with shipping guys to save a buck... you aggravate customers!  Customer service did offer a replacement after I were to send mine back, but alas, too much of an effort, AND my son could not have handled the delay.. On the upside, the price was lower than other box stores.. All and all, we are pleased.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The character development is still there as we learn more about our favorite characters in the series. Good twists and suspense kept me reading for hours. Highly recommended.<br />This is nothing like Battle Royale except in initial \\"game\\" concept. Story is better.
0307477479|1.0|I finished the book, all the while hoping it would redeem itself.  Certainly the worst book I've read all year, and I read one book a week.  Shameful that it won the Pulitzer.  Spare yourself the time and skip it.
0062060554|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't wait to get back to the book every time I put it down. I thought the twist and turns were fantastic.
B00008973Q|5.0|This basically Akira Kurosawa's version of King Lear. Done in his vision.This a great movie,one of his best.As usual his filming his top rate. Sweeping visuals only in style that he is known for. If you like Japanese film, this is one you should have in your collection.
0062109383|5.0|Had to send my first set of CD's back because one disc was so scratched it would not play.  The second set all play but the surfaces of each and every one were scratched to some extent, one badly but still played.  This tells me that the quality control was poor.  If I had it to do again I would download mp3's instead, especially since it was a \\"reading\\" and not music.  The Patti Smith reading is wonderful.  I read the book first and then enjoyed her reading a couple months later.  Would recommend this to all Patti Smith fans.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Loved this CD!  Duets II is wonderful!  I love the variety of singers that Tony Bennet is paired with on this CD. I was especially pleased to hear the duet with Amy Winehouse.  I was also happy he had Michael Buble and k.d Lang back in action on Duets II.  They go hand in hand with Tony.  The biggest surprise was his duet with Lady Gaga. She sounded amazing and he sounded so energized singing \\"Lady is a Tramp\\" with her.  I personally would have enjoyed having Diana Krall on Duets II but maybe they will do a CD together! Just a thought!
B0000009SY|5.0|The CD was new and sealed.  It is very hard to find at any stores or for download.  Very glad I was able to find it on Amazon!
B0053YGYO4|3.0|I've been a Coldplay fan since their brilliant 2001 debut Parachutes. I had that album way before they ever broke mainstream and became the huge success they are today. In a way, I wish they were still under the radar in terms of popularity. I feel when a band becomes so popular, they tend to lose some of that interest. And sometimes they try too hard to please their fans and critics by attempting to balance mainstream acceptance with experimentation.  I'm not flat out accusing Coldplay of that, since Viva La Vida I felt was their most un-conventional record, but there's no doubt with one listen of Mylo Xyloto that this is by far the band's most pop sounding  and mainstream album to date. I suppose it's a bit experimental for Coldplay, but its nothing groundbreaking. In all honestly, its far less interesting than Vida La Vida or any of their other albums actually. Here's a track by track review of the album:<br /><br />-\\"Mylo Xyloto\\" - Simply an intro that comes in at under a minute that simply sets up the next track.<br /><br />-\\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" -  An up-tempo and catchy synth-laced pop track, but nothing amazing in my opinion. Would have been better if I was more stripped down.<br /><br />- \\"Paradise\\" - After repeated listens, I just can't get into this song. It's just too much pop for me. The verses sound better than the chorus, which just goes full blown, over-produced pop. One of the weakest songs on the entire album in my opinion.<br /><br />- \\"Charlie Brown\\" - A bit of an anthem sounding track that brings back more of the signature Coldplay sound, though it sounds more like a song by Embrace than Coldplay. It's a decent tune, but nothing amazing.<br /><br />- \\"Us Against the World\\" -  One of the best songs of the album, if not the best. These are the kinds of songs I expect from Coldplay. A acoustically-driven song with a great melody and vocal performance by Chris Martin.<br /><br />- \\"M.M.I.X\\" - Just another short instrumental that leads up to the next track.<br /><br />- \\"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\\"- Another song I can't seem to get into, though I can see why it's a single because of its catchiness. For starters, the opening keyboard intro just doesn't do it for me. Though there is a rock'n'roll inside this track, including a nice little guitar riff, this song is just so over-produced and layered. Doing this song is a more simple rock'n'roll style would do wonders for it. At around the 3:00 minute mark, it does seem to kick in to almost a full-blown rock song, but too bad that lasts under a minute.<br /><br />- \\"Major Minus\\" - This is a really good tune. Probably the most straight-forward rock song on the album. Love the rhythm of this track, and some really good guitar work. Overall, might be the best full band effort on the album.<br /><br />- \\"U.F.O.\\" - Another great tune here. A very simple acoustic song, with another great vocal performance. Unfortunately it only goes to the  2:00 minute mark, while the last 18 seconds or so segues into the next track.<br /><br />_\\"Princess of China\\" - Oh boy, here we go. If I had thought that some of these tracks sounded a bit too \\"poppish\\" or overdone, then this one takes it to a new level! This is pretty much a pure pop tune. And with Rhianna taking most of the vocals with this one, I rest my case. Though her voice does seem to fit with the song, that again, proves my point about what kind of song this is. In truth, this sounds more like a Rhianna song with Coldplay as the guest performer, not the other way around. Its going to be easy to see why a lot of teeny boppers and fans of Rhianna are going to like this one, cause again, its catchy as a pop tune. But as a true Coldplay fan, I just can't say I like this track much at all.<br /><br />- \\"Up in Flames\\" - A really good slow-tempo track with perhaps the best vocal performance on the whole record. The mix is a little heavy on the simple and steady beat of the song, but other that, it's a really good track.<br /><br />-\\"A Hopeful Transmission\\" - Again, just another instrumental that serves as an intro to the next track.<br /><br />-\\"Don't Let it Break Your Heart\\" - First off, I can't say how much this reminds me of an Embrace song! If by some chance you don't know of Embrace, I definitely recommend them. Though if you know your Coldplay history at all, you should who Embrace is. Anyway, this is one of those uplifting, roaring songs that sounds nice and all, but it boils down to nothing spectacular in my opinion. What hurt this song is that's so over-produced. The vocals get lost in all of the layers of music, and that takes away from the song a lot. Its not a bad track, but it could have been better.<br /><br />- \\"Up With the Birds\\" - A decent closing track, that has different tempos to it. Starts out slow with vocals and piano and kind of  builds up as it goes along.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably the weakest effort from the band to date. First off, where are the guitars? There are some nice guitar parts here and there, but overall, there is very little of just vocals, guitar, bass, and drums here. Not many memorable guitar moments or solos. One of the best things about Coldplay is that melodic sound that have, that's what makes them so enjoyable. I have to say that the mixing and production missed the mark for the most part as well. There are a few tracks that Chris Martin's vocals seem to be faded out and almost in the background, while the synth and pop stuff almost is too loud and nearly drowns out the vocals. In closing, I want the more simple, stripped down, and  even \\"rock n roll\\" side of Coldplay to come out. They have seemed to gradually gotten away since Parachutes, and that's a bit disappointing. They are glimpses of that side of Coldplay one a few tracks here, but its definitely not enough for me. I only can hope that they choose to drop most of the pop stuff and go back more to the basics with future releases.<br /><br />Key Tracks: \\"Us Against the World\\", \\"Major Minus\\", \\"U.F.O\\", \\"Up in Flames\\"Let it Break Your Heart\\" - First off, I can't say how much this reminds me of an Embrace song!

B000NOK06W|5.0|Ennio Morricone is a fantastic artist.  The \\"Mission\\"  alone would make this purchase worth it.  Great selections which show Ennio's talent.  A great price too.
B0002U0UKS|5.0|I already knew the soundtrack was amazing, and when I received the CD it was everything I knew it would be from watching the DVD about a million times. Also, I bought this CD from Hyper Speed and they delivered it sooner than I expected, which only added to my satisfaction.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This movie is a MUST SEE, and I wish I could say you wouldn't believe your eyes, but really most that is detailed in this movie, we already knew or watched happen.  What is shocking is the inter connections between some of our most famous politicians and how they snow jobbed us.... really still are.  Really, don't read too many of these reviews - just watch the movie - what a great job the director did in gathering all this footage and putting it together in a somewhat easy to follow manner.  I feel a bit more educated after seeing this.

B005IY3DP2|5.0|The easiest way of judging this album is by looking at the song that didn't make it. For any other band \\"Pistols at Dawn\\" would be their lead single. For Kasabian, it's a B-Side.  The fact that this \\"jukebox on shuffle\\" album is as solid as it is demonstrates the versatility and musical genius of lead songwriter Sergio Pizzorno - Velociraptor follows the Murcury Award winning West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum by barely 2 years.   So, in little more than 27 months, the lads have turned out another cracker of an album bristling with songs that each show a different style and feel... from The Beatles to Led Zepplin to Muse to Gene Pitney... and they are all amazing stand alone tracks.  Velociraptor is an instant classic that does not disappoint. Buy it.   And, while you're at it, hunt down \\"Pistols at Dawn.\\"
B0009P5YXO|2.0|I bought this Dr. Who toy for my 15-year-old's birthday, and after reading the product description and other reviews I was expecting this toy to be much nicer. My first impression was, \\"this thing really looks more plasticky than I was expecting.\\" The light and the noise work my as expected, but it feels cheap and poorly made. When you extend the screwdriver the cap on the back often falls off and the whole thing feels a bit like it might fall apart. This feels like a $5 toy to me, it was definitely not worth over $30. My son was very excited about the gift when he saw it, and quickly went through the first battery, but overall I'd still say his impression was \\"disappointed\\" as well.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|The CG was a bit bad, and the action montage was a bit overdone... it could have used a bit more movie and less 22nd century tech in the 1940s.<br /><br />Still, a decent watch.

0439023521|5.0|I don't know how anyone could not love this book.  I was just shocked when I saw people give it a 1 star.  This book was a total page turner. You just never knew what was going to happen next; I loved it.  I just finished the book, and as much as I love amazon, I can't wait to get the next book; I am going to run to the book store to get the next one right away!
B005IZLPMY|2.0|First of all, I saw this in theatres. I did not buy the blu-ray version. I don't know extra stuff you get for blu-ray. That being said, if the movie is no good (which is the main reason why you would even buy this) then its all for not. Well, how can I put it? This movie is no good.  I was really looking forward to this movie and went with a buddy to see it opening day. I was really hoping captain america would save the summer from so called blockbusters that sucked (im looking at you green lantern). It's very hard not use the word bland when it comes to this movie, but thats exactly what it is. It is not a bad movie in the regular sense, but i ceases to do much or take any chances. Some may qualify that as bad. Putting all semantic discussions aside, this movie is frequently boring and sometime down right comical for all the wrong reasons. It was directed by Joe Johnston. Hes a done a few good movies that I enjoyed from my childhood like Jumanji. I was hoping he would keep it interesting, but fails. This movie follows the super hero story cliche without missing a beat. A loser nobody finds himself blessed with new incredible abilities, must overcome personal obstacles, have a fleeting meeting with villain only to fight again at the end and don't forget a love interest thrown in for good measure. Of course, these are how all superhero stories must be told. However, the recent SPiderman and the Batman films have done this so much better. In the batman movies, there is a real struggle going on with bruce wayne. Spiderman 2 also creates an interesting conflict among the characters. All of this is absent in Captain America. Worse than this is the amount of time it takes for the movie to get going. The film doesn't really get going until the second half with only one fight scene up to that point. After an early chase scene after Steve Rogers gets his powers, he is sent to sell war bonds instead of fighting the germans. Apparently, the military thought this would be a better use of a super soldier, to send him around doing song and dance routines to build up moral. This feels like such a waste of time. Finally, the movie eventually starts, but lets you down again. The majority of the action scense are too short and cheesy. Captain America has no problem going behind enemy lines and sneaking into a german base hiding american pow's. A few quick punches and he is inside. Remember that action montage during the commercials? That is the same thing in the movie. That does not take place in any kind of actual fight scene. In the movie, the same montage is used to speed up the story to get to more important parts. Here, Captain America has become more famous and goes around busting up german locations.   Not to mention, they totally blew having Hugo Weaving in this movie. They give him nothing to do other than to look angry and brood over the magical blue ancient Nordic orb. This is a glowing rock that has magical properties. The Hydra (Nazi sub group) are trying to somehow harness the energy to of course make a super weapon and take over the world..................sigh. I never read the comics, but i assume this is a part of it. Nevertheless, it just could not look any more silly on screen.   Thus, in captain america, we have a movie that has sub par action sequences, cheesy humor, an unexciting plot, and an underutilized villain. I can't really even recommend renting this. Its just not that exciting. As I said, the action scenes never go on long enough and there is too much boring plot filler in between. For some reason, it is highly popular right now at Redbox. You may have to wait awhile to see it. However, definitely do not buy this even on DVD. You will never watch it more than once.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|First of all, i'm a big Coldplay fan. I've listened to whatever material the band has published till now, and that journey has been very enriching. And I just simply love this new offering from one of the best rock acts to have come out of England. For anyone not familiar with Coldplay or for any die hard fan, Mylo Xyloto is a must have to experience the transition in their music and the fact that legendary Brian Eno has his midas touch written all over this album makes this so special. In Parachutes, their sound was so hauntingly melancholy, gloomy yet sophisticated and elegant as many other British bands, and after so many hit albums, this Mylo Xyloto, they are vivacious, playful, gorgeous yet keeping their basic sound intact. Since the day I got hold of the disc, its been a roller coaster ride from Mylo Xyloto to Up with the Birds, and I've been doing repeat play back of all the tracks. This is not the first time the band has taken R'n'b artiste in one of their songs, here being Rihanna in 'Princess of China', they have done a wonderful version of 'Lost' in Viva La Vida-Prospect's March with Kanye West. I'll not go into a detail description of all the songs here since all of them are great and worth listening over and over again, stand out tracks are 'hurts like heaven', 'charlie brown', 'us against the world', 'princess of china' and 'up with the birds'. So, in the end, a big Thank You to Chris Martin and the boys for once again proving their musical brilliance and I just can't wait to hear them performing these tracks live on stage. A transition in music is always the mark of versatility in any musician's career, and 'long live' great music and 'long live' Coldplay.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|I've been on the Coldplay bandwagon from the very beginning, starting with the \\"Blue Room EP\\" in 1999 and the stunning debut album in 2000. There was definitely a departure from the 'classic' Coldplay sound on the 2008 \\"Viva La Vida\\" album, although there were plenty of interesting songs on that one. Now 3 1/2 years later we get the eagerly awaited follow-up album, Coldplay's 5th studio album.<br /><br />\\"Mylo Xyloto\\" (14 tracks; 44 min.) is actually 11 songs with 3 short (less than a minute) instrumental preludes such as the opener title track. That is followed by \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\", one of a handful songs that all sound alike, uptempo with lots of synths and/or orchestration (other tracks like it: \\"Charlie Brown\\", \\"Every Tear Is a Waterfall\\" (1st single), \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\"). When you then look at what remains, there are several interesting songs, such as \\"Paradise\\" (2nd single), the pensive \\"Us Against the World\\", and \\"Up In Flames\\", which for me is the best track on here, certainly the least bombastic tune, also mostly lacking all orchestral instrumentation or synths omni-present on the other songs. And there is of course the song with Rihanna \\"Princess of China\\", which just makes me scratch my hair.<br /><br />In all, while there are certainly some good moments on here, this album is BY FAR my least favorite Coldplay album to date. But hey, who's counting? The guys have reached mainstream commercial success, and more power to them for it! Indeed we are far removed from the time I saw them live for the first time in Portland, OR back in February, 2001 when they were mostly unknown still here in the US. I saw them again mostly recently in concert at Lollapaolooza a few months ago, and the setlist was a dizzying back-and=forth between tracks from the new album (half of the album was played) and the rich back catalog. I will never tire seeing them live. That said, I am not wild about \\"Mylo Xyloto\\".

B003JACWZ4|5.0|Season Three of the Gilmore Girls is one of the best of all seven seasons. In this season, Rory [Alexis Bledel] is in her final year at Chilton private school and faces some of the most trying times, be it manouvering political games within the student body, or the love triangle between her, Dean [Jared Padalecki] and Jess [Milo Ventimiglia]. Alexis Bledel does a wonderful job in this season and truly shows her maturing as an actress.<br /><br />Of course, Lorelai [Lauren Graham] continues to shine in her role as a single mom, best friend to her daughter, and aspiring inn owner. Lorelai, fresh from the romantic disappointments of the previous two seasons finds herself sort of lost, and dates around, never truly finding a soulmate. Diner owner Luke Danes [Scott Patterson] is always there to lend his unwavering support and of course, Luke and Lorelai's chemistry is simply magical to watch, be it as good friends or as two people slowly being drawn towards each other.<br /><br />The rocky relations between Lorelai and her parents Emily and Richard Gilmore [ Kelly Bishop and Edward Hermann] goes through its usual turbulent times and its always entertaining to see Lorelai in action and putting her parents in their place, despite their overbearing attitude. Kelly Bishop's Emily is truly a delight to watch as she plays the snooty, controlling character to perfection.<br /><br />Amidst the changes in the main characters' lives this season, the most significant ones are the Rory-Jess-Dean love triangle, and for once we see Rory getting out of her goody-two-shoes character by going after Jess despite being Dean's girlfriend and the episode \\"They Shoot Gilmores Don't They\\" shows the resolution to this. There is also the college application anxiety, is it going to be Harvard or Yale?<br /><br />Lorelai's dreams of opening her own inn are developed in greater detail this season, as we see her working hard towards achieving that dream, especially with a certain event that acts as a catalyst towards that end. All in all, I rank this as my favorite GG season, but all the seasons are winners of course. A must-watch series!I rank this as my favorite GG season, but all the seasons are winners of course.

B004LROUNG|5.0|I always thought that the very first Grisham books were the best. He had a passion in his text. Then after that he seems to become more tired of writing. His characters are not so alive. His stories were always about a young lawyer going against the big corporations or against the loopholes in the legal and political systems. His success was not surprising. I did not like the books like the Broker so much, but then this book was better again reminding me of his first books.<br /><br />The characters like Oscar Finley and Wally Figg, partners at Finley & Figg are detailed in their description and also sometimes funny and sometimes not even likeable. These lawyers are trying get by in their miserable lives by trying to get some money out of their clients and of any situation possible.<br /><br />David Zinc is another memorable character tired of the excessive working in a huge legal firm. Then one day Figg finds out about a potentially huge lawsuit against a pharmaceutical manufacturer, and he starts signing up other clients. And again, Grisham's poor lawyers are against a formidable army of high-paid corporate attorneys. If you liked Grisham's older books like the Client or the Rainman then this is the right book for you.
B002DERKGS|5.0|This is my all-time favorite TV show! Every episode makes for riveting viewing, and the great casting makes all the difference...the drama centers around the life and exploits of single mother Lorelai Gilmore [the amazing Lauren Graham] who raises her only child Rory [stunning Alexis Bledel]in the idyllic town of Stars Hollow, somewhere in Connecticut. Its an amazing drama...every episode here in Season One makes you really come to know and love the characters, both main and secondary. We come to care about what happens to Lorelai & Rory...in Season One, 16 year old Rory gets accepted into the prestigious private school Chilton, and Lorelai has to grapple with the problem of how to finance it, and out of desperation approaches her estanged parents for help. The chemistry between the two leads as mother and daughter is electrifying and altogether credible...Lorelai's parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore are portrayed as stuffy, upper-class people who use money as the means to keep tabs on their daughter and granddaughter. Of course, the stories go deeper than that, and the characters themselves develop in greater depth as the series goes on...but herein lies the chram in Gilmore Girls...the dialogue, witty repartee and stellar acting from all characters make this a show that grows from strength to strength and makes an addict of the viewer.<br /><br />The residents of Stars Hollow are an eccentric bunch indeed - be it Luke of Luke's Diner, Ms Patty the dance teacher, Taylor the town councilman,Michel the crabby concierge, Sookie St James the irreverent cook and BFF of Lorelai, Lane Kim as Rory's sidekick - we come to love each of these characters for their role in the series.<br /><br />Watching these episodes is like a reunion of old friends - and every fall, I rewatch the seasons of Gilmore Girls, and get the feeling that I'm part of something special and magical, a feeling like I'm truly home. A must-watch series, and highly recommended.

B002DGOWHQ|5.0|From the time I viewed the first episode of Gilmore Girls, I was hooked, and the attachment to this beloved show has only grown from strength to strength [yes, even till the less than satisfying final season 7].<br /><br />Season Two sees us revisiting Stars Hollow, the idyllic little Connecticut town that is home to Lorelai Gilmore and her teenage daughter Rory. There are some interesting plot developments in this season - Lorelai gets engaged to Max and faces some dilemmas and inner conflict, Rory's stable relationship with Dean, her long-term boyfriend is threatened by the arrival of Jess, a rebellious teenager from NY who also happens to be Luke's nephew, and of course, the turbulent relationship that Lorelai has with her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore goes through more upheaval.And Luke gets into some romantic entanglements of his own.<br /><br />There are other interesting developments in this season that make GG an addictive must-watch - Rory's rivalry with Paris Geller, Richard's forced retirement and its aftermath, Christopher's re-entry into the Gilmore girls' lives and many more. The eccentric townspeople of Stars Hollow add to the appeal of the show, Taylor Doose's 'dictatorship' of the town goes to new heights, Kirk's manic antics and many more. All of which, coupled with rapidfire witty dialogue that has become the trademark of the show make Gilmore Girls a rare gem amongst TV series - great casting, excellent scripts and beautiful, scenic sets. A must-watch indeed!
B004G25V9S|5.0|In \\"Heritage\\", elements of early Uriah Heep, Deep Purple and ELP can be heard.  This is a solid prog album that pays joyful tribute to the titans of the genre, while remaining uniquely Opeth.
B003JA7P1K|5.0|Season Five starts off with a bang, and just keeps getting better with every episode. At the end of Season Four, Rory [Alexis Bledel] sleeps with her married ex-boyfriend Dean [Jared Padalecki] and the beginning of Season Five sees Rory being 'sent' off on a European tour with her grandma Emily [Kelly Bishop], a ruse by Lorelai [Lauren Graham] hoping that things will cool between Rory and Dean.<br /><br />The plot twists in this season are fascinating - Rory eventually finds herself drifting apart from Dean, and drawn towards rich kid, Logan Huntzbeger [Matt Czuchry] which delight the senior Gilmores but not Lorelai. Luke and Lorelai's relationship grows from strength to strength, with some major hiccups in between, no thanks to the interference of Emily Gilmore [Kelly Bishop] and Christopher.<br /><br />The last two episodes of this season truly keeps you riveted as a dejected Rory turns to a desperate act that lands her not only in trouble with the law but also causes a rift between her and her mother, Lorelai. The writing is as good as ever and the acting superb. This is a great season that is sure to delight fans and new viewers alike.
B0061IMJBI|4.0|If you're unfamiliar with the comics on which this show is based, it might be helpful to know the title could just as easily be \\"Desperation\\" since this whole concept is exploring the depth of humanity: how far will you go to keep your family safe, save your son, and be with your wife? What's one life worth compared with another? Whose life? What about your own? These sorts of questions are the root of the series. Obviously, any basic philosophy class deals with these issues, so to keep it interesting  to people like me zombies are thrown in there as the catalyst forcing the questions to find resolution.  In this episode we start to see some of the characters coming together into the cohesion the comics are so highly regarded for. Mainly, Shane comes into his own. It's a slow burning wick to be sure, but the payout is so, so worth it. I was definitely impressed. Rick and Lori as well, although they're a tad more relatable. Glenn, Maggie, Dale, and Andrea all turn in solid performances that build their characters and it's great to see some  teetering on the brink while others are grounded in their resolve. (Daryl is great too, but hey, it's Norman Reedus. The sky is also blue, in case obviousness isn't your strong suit.) And of course, the whole point of watching the show, the zombies that give chase to Shane and Otis are well done and convincing. The entire sequence in the high school was all around solid.  Very well crafted piece of entertainment. Handshakes all around.

0062101897|5.0|If you felt that \\"Harry Potter Film Wizardry\\" offered just a fraction of the magic of the Harry Potter movies and left you hungry for more, then Bob McCabe's \\"Harry Potter: Page to Screen\\" is the perfect book to satisfy that hunger.<br /><br />The book is sized like an encyclopedia, weighs like an encyclopedia and it's wonderful.  Although it does not have the neat, detachable paper props that \\"HP Film Wizardry\\" has, \\"HP Page to Screen\\" is far much more comprehensive when it comes to the making of each movie. Part I of the book includes information on how the books were adapted to film (why some things were left out), on the actors, directors, and creative teams and on their experiences and the challenges they had to face as they brought the seven books to life. The \\"Behind the Scenes\\" short sections zero on the construction of a particular set, the design of a costume or creature, the staging of a scene or the creation of a special effect. Most pictures in the first part of the book show the actors and directors working on stage or on location.<br /><br />The second part of the book is dedicated to the art of the movies as represented in the costume designs, set design, make up and special effects, and prop making. This part of the book is a visual delight.  Here is where the reader can find the dragons, wands, Death Eater masks, brooms, the Golden Snitch, the potions classroom, Diagon Alley, trolls, Ministry propaganda, Quibbler covers, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes product packaging and more. The pictures as well as the concept art are gorgeous.<br /><br />Curiously, the live animals that \\"played\\" Hedwig, Crookshanks and Scabbers were left out of the book, which I thought was a strange oversight since a section or a few paragraphs on their role and that of the animal trainers would have really not been out of place in this book.  Another omission, this time a human actor, is Shirley Henderson who played Moaning Myrtle. Except for a picture in the \\"Locations: Set Design\\" section of the second half of the book, I couldn't find a reference of her and her character in the sections devoted to the making of \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" or \\"The Goblet of Fire.\\"<br /><br />In spite of these small exclusions, HP Page to Screen makes a great and deserving companion book to the movies.  After reading \\"HP Page to Screen,\\" you will know why Lupin's werewolf is hairless and the next time you watch Hagrid, you may be able to tell if it is Robbie Coltrane or his body double wearing a Hagrid prosthetic head. This book is pricey but those who adore the HP movies should not miss it.lf of the book, I couldn't find a reference of her and her character in the sections devoted to the making of \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" or \\"The Goblet of Fire.\\"  In spite of these small exclusions, HP Page to Screen makes a great and deserving companion book to the movies.

B0057R5XRG|4.0|\\"Jurassic Park\\"<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park\\" was a revelation when I went to the theater & seen it! Before \\"Jurassic Park,\\" we only had stop motion animation for dinosaurs & other assorted creatures. Movies like \\"Dragon Slayer\\" perfected the art of stop motion, but \\"Jurassic Park\\" made the dinosaurs REAL! It was like going back in time through the theater screen!<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park\\" did not only look good, but it was a great movie! Sure, the dinosaurs were the centerpiece of attraction here, but the script, acting, & especially the editing for action sequences was top notch. This was a thrill ride, equal to any amusement park's. The T-Rex scene in it's self, was the absolute zenith of entrancement through tension, suspense, & orchestration of manipulating the audience with pure awe & terror! It was a scene like no other before it, & only rivaled by a few after. It still thrills me to this day! The Raptors were not far behind it!<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park\\" is essential entertainment for the movie lover! Even one's who are not fans of Sci-Fi, ala' dinosaurs. A major movie event then, & still is today!<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks great, though there is some grain in the dark shots. The sound is terrific. An upgrade is recommended!<br /><br />\\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\"<br /><br />3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />When I heard that they were bringing out a sequel to \\"Jurassic Park,\\" I was pumped as Fred Flintstone having a life time gift certificate at Bronto King! I was frothing at the jaws to see this film! I was even more excited to hear Spielberg was directing again, can't go wrong there, can you... or can you???<br /><br />\\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" hit the theaters, & I was there, ready to be awed & adrenalized like I was from the first one! It did not happen! WHAT HAPPENED??? Oh, there were dinosaurs a plenty, more than the first. They brought back Jeff Glodblum's character, Dr. Ian Malcom, who I enjoyed in the first movie. Of course, Spielberg was back...or was he??? I'm not so sure? Was this the same Spielberg that directed the first one??? Surely, it must of been his stunt dummy double, for this film had more plot holes big enough to drop a heard of Brontosaurs through, with out touching the sides, than a mine field! Also, miscasting by ice ages with Malcom's daughter, who even the movie makes fun of, \\"Do you see a family resemblance?\\" I read the book, but this total lapse in judgment, was a huge Stegosaurus tail spike through the brain. It was a total cut & paste job! Lets throw in the daughter, because she was in the book, but lets totally forget about the book from there. The girl stuck out like a sore Iguanodon thumb! Nuff said about that.<br /><br />Now for the dumb humans as Dino treats! Did the human race completely loose all their intelligence? I mean, I know with a movie like this you have to suspend disbelief to enjoy, but do you have to check your brain in to the coat check, before entering the theater? Lets see, you got Julianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding, a predator specialist with extensive experience with predators in Africa. First thing this woman does is runs straight in to a group of mad Stegosaurs, because she was petting their baby & took a picture, & when the camera automatically winds, the baby Stegosaur cries out. Now I don't know about you, but I would not be petting & taking close up baby portraits, while Mom & Dad are 100 feet away. Then when said, Mom & Dad get mad & charge, I would not run straight through them. I'd turn tail & run the opposite way. Ok, I got that off my chest, but it's still to heavy! So lets talk about bringing the baby T-Rex back to the trailer & mending it's broken leg. Ok, I can see wanting to save the baby, but said Dr. Sarah Harding, predator specialist, does not even know any better than after surviving the parents T-Rex attack on the trailer, to take off her blood soaked jacket from the baby T-Rex & try washing the scent off her skin??? I mean, it was raining, right? Then, if that was not enough, the macho hunter guys help pull them up the cliff side, & the big African game hunter who said earlier, \\"I'm tired of putting my life in jeopardy for a bunch of rich dentists,\\" or something to that effect, sees Sarah's jacket & doesn't say, get rid of it! Or, how about the Paleontologist who had a brilliant conversation about T-Rex having the largest olfactory (meaning smelling capacity) of any dinosaur (which is true). He said, T-Rex would not track them after they got out of their territory, then was reminded about T-Rex's smeller, & then not tell Dr. Sarah Harding, to kindly remove her jacket, before T-Rex picks us out of his teeth with a tree??? Oh, I could go on & on about these truly dumb humans, even in San Diego, watching a speeding ship on radar, ready to crash into the dock, & just staring out to sea, only to run the moment before the ship actually hits the dock, oh boy! One more thing, was this ship scene a homage to Dracula??? All the dead body parts laying around the ship, yet the T-Rex still in the hold (though to be fair, there was a arm & hand holding the open & shut buttons), & how about the severed hand hanging from the steering wheel, though the bridge is to small for the T-Rex to get in, & the windows were not even broken??? Shame on you Mr. Spielberg!<br /><br />But wait! Even with all the things I just wrote about, & all the things I could've wrote about, but didn't, the San Diego part of the movie saved this film from being totally Dino, doo doo! I have to admit, I got a charge out of the Godzilla homage here, & if anything, watching the Japanese with cameras, running with the rest of the people, away from the rampaging T-Rex, was worth the price of admission alone! I roared over that, & other scenes, the last third of the film.<br /><br />So we have a third of a good to great movie here, that, if not makes up for the first two thirds, at least equals things out. So, \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" ends up being a very good popcorn movie, that is, if you leave your brain at the coat check!<br /><br />Recommended for all of us with two Stegosaurus brains. A very small one in the head, & an even smaller one in the butt!<br /><br />The Blu-ray even looks better than \\"Jurassic Park!\\" Gone is the grain which is quite evident in the dark scenes of the first film. If you like or love this film, I recommend the upgrade!<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park III\\"<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />ARRRGH! \\"Jurassic Park III,\\", now this is a Dinosaur movie! Just about everything that was wrong with \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" has been fixed & improved. Yes, there is a plot hole here & there, always is, but compared to \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" huge mine field of holes, this film is as smooth, trim (92 minutes running time), & manicured as a putting green on a championship golf course! The characters in this film are actually intelligent, as these things go. Not just Dino bait.<br /><br />Sam Neil returns as Dr Alan Grant, being scammed in to finding the lost son of Paul Kirby, played be William H Macy & Amanda Kirby, played by Tea Leoni. The son Erik was hang gliding from a boat with Amanda's boyfriend when trouble strikes, & the two had to glide in to Isla Sorna for safety. They were hang gliding to see dinosaurs, & boy, did they get to see dinosaurs, as both were marooned on the island. Very shortly the boyfriend is killed, leaving Erik to fend for his self.<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park III\\" is an action packed 92 minutes of dinosaur delight. Several new dinosaurs pop up here, especially one giant, nasty, persistent, Spinosaurus, who has acquired a taste for human flesh. Spinosaurus is the largest land predator ever to live, even a tad bigger than T-Rex! Speaking of Spinosaurus & T-Rex, we get a great fight scene between the two early on, though to short, it kicked major dino butt! As a matter of fact, whether it's the Spinosaur, Raptors, or Pterodactls, this movie just does not quit, as one narrow escape, follows another. I have to admit, the Spinosaurus was as good as the T-Rex in the first \\"Jurassic Park,\\" it was relentless! The final scene was phenomenal!<br /><br />Though this film was not as well thought out, or should I say, as complexly plotted as the first \\"Jurassic Park\\" film, it's not meant to be. This is a rescue film of such simplicity, it's beautiful. Were all here to get Dino action, & we get all that & more. A great survival film that has been maligned for all the wrong reasons, this is a true \\"Jurassic Park film!<br /><br />The Blu-ray is exceptional, as is the whole Jurassic Park\\" trilogy. Worth the upgrade!check!  Recommended for all of us with two Stegosaurus brains. A very small one in the head, & an even smaller one in the butt!  The Blu-ray even looks better than \\"Jurassic Park!\\" Gone is the grain which is quite evident in the dark scenes of the first film. If you like or love this film, I recommend the upgrade!  \\"Jurassic Park III\\"  4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece  ARRRGH! \\"Jurassic Park III,\\", now this is a Dinosaur movie! Just about everything that was wrong with \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" has been fixed & improved. Yes, there is a plot hole here & there, always is, but compared to \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" huge mine field of holes, this film is as smooth, trim (92 minutes running time), & manicured as a putting green on a championship golf course! The characters in this film are actually intelligent, as these things go. Not just Dino bait.  Sam Neil returns as Dr Alan Grant, being scammed in to finding the lost son of Paul Kirby, played be William H Macy & Amanda Kirby, played by Tea Leoni. The son Erik was hang gliding from a boat with Amanda's boyfriend when trouble strikes, & the two had to glide in to Isla Sorna for safety. They were hang gliding to see dinosaurs, & boy, did they get to see dinosaurs, as both were marooned on the island. Very shortly the boyfriend is killed, leaving Erik to fend for his self.  \\"Jurassic Park III\\" is an action packed 92 minutes of dinosaur delight. Several new dinosaurs pop up here, especially one giant, nasty, persistent, Spinosaurus, who has acquired a taste for human flesh. Spinosaurus is the largest land predator ever to live, even a tad bigger than T-Rex! Speaking of Spinosaurus & T-Rex, we get a great fight scene between the two early on, though to short, it kicked major dino butt! As a matter of fact, whether it's the Spinosaur, Raptors, or Pterodactls, this movie just does not quit, as one narrow escape, follows another. I have to admit, the Spinosaurus was as good as the T-Rex in the first \\"Jurassic Park,\\" it was relentless! The final scene was phenomenal!   Though this film was not as well thought out, or should I say, as complexly plotted as the first \\"Jurassic Park\\" film, it's not meant to be. This is a rescue film of such simplicity, it's beautiful. Were all here to get Dino action, & we get all that & more. A great survival film that has been maligned for all the wrong reasons, this is a true \\"Jurassic Park film!  The Blu-ray is exceptional, as is the whole Jurassic Park\\" trilogy. Worth the upgrade!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I played Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Greedy Spiders and more. This one is the best. Very balanced and challenging puzzles, nice graphics, works perfectly on my Galaxy Tab 10.1. Very stable so far. Worth every penny.

0375826742|1.0|This book should have been edited by a professional. It feels like C.P. doesn't know himself how to end the story, when in fact we all know. (Yeah, I bet Eragon will win Arya's heart, marry him, become prince and they both leave for Valinor :) on a ship because alas they are not allowed to stay in Alagaesia. Right?) So it's just turbo adjectives (more than possible in a sentence) to make it a long-long-long read.<br />The frustrating fact is, that the original Eragon was a good one. No problem that it had familiar setups from other phantasies, it did have a new style, new ideas, and the dragon was fun, indeed. Paolini was under age that times, and so the elders around him helped him to create a full story with a beginning and an end, with the right pace. Now that he is a grown up, those folks let him do his stuff alone. The Eldest had complete conversations repeated! Arya I love you. I don't. Arya I love you. Not again, you. By the way, thanks to the genius of the Hungarian translator, in my mother tongue version one doesn't notice these repeats so quickly. Here there was the freedom for versatility whereas the original English version is given, there's nothing a publisher can do about it, except read it before printing... It was so much worse than the first book, I thought the publishers would have a serious talk with Paolini. But no, they didn't.<br /><br />Someone should tell the author, that an episode in a story only makes sense if it is important from the whole picture's point of view. Otherwise, delete it! Someone should also tell him that a sentence in the fiction industry must carry new information! Or at least the majority of the text - say, over 50% for heaven's sake - should! In Brisingr we spend hundreds of pages just to learn one new piece of information: why it's even harder to kill Galbatorix - and we already knew it was close to impossible. Ah yes, and Roran's love is saved now. (Imho, the whole Roran thread should have been written in another story - this would be a good one - somewhere else. Here it distracts and forces detours.)<br /><br />I truly hope that the last book will be the last one. I truly hope C.P. has read some of the critics. And I am waiting for a revised edition of Brisingr.be a good one - somewhere else. Here it distracts and forces detours.)  I truly hope that the last book will be the last one.

B0034G4P80|1.0|I was excited for this film, but absolutely hated the whole thing.  The superhero setup is stupid, acting is weak, screenplay is dull... I can't say anything nice about this.  I just really didn't like it.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|let me start by saying i think parachutes is their best album..btw i recommend you get all the bsides from this era..incredible.  after that album they lost their way imo...  rush of blood is good but a big change....x&y was all pop and little substance...viva la vida could have been good but i only like a couple songs.  this new album is pop but also very melodic and \\"trippy\\" which is something that lacked a bit on x&y..
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|This is one of those TV shows you'll become a huge fan of, if you aren't already! I've watched the series on TV and DVD, and now streaming it. Something about the well-cast crew and passengers of Serenity, the beleivable sci-fi future set in a nearby star system ruled by America and China, and the dusty gritty feel to most of the environments we see, all combine with great direction and story lines of a not-quite-beaten independent captain operating below the radar of the rigidly conformist government, and a pair of siblings hiding from nefarious schemes of that same institution, to vault this show to classic status! It is wonderful of Amazon to offer Firefly to Prime members so take advantage and stream it now!
B00004U45G|5.0|the black crowes back him up incredibly....jimmy is so high in the mix he is clearly audible and distinguishable..even the other guitarists compliment jimmy so well...you can always tell if its jimmy or someone else...the singer does a wonderful job..best singer since robert plant for page..  its almost pure zeppelin classics played wonderfully..page still has it man..was great.  recommended heavily to jimmy page fans!
1848566980|5.0|This is only the second review i have written on Amazon, and i have ordered hundreds of books.  That is because i was so impressed by this book i thought i should convey that to others.  What you want to know - Full colour throughout, nice glossy pages, approximately 500 individual images contained within, Hardcover and a great price for what you get.  Only one minor complaint, or more of an observation - many of the images are only quarter or half page sized and would have been much better as full page images. But then the book would have had to have been much larger or been in a two part format - anyway, great book - get it and you wont be dissapointed.
B002L6I9Z4|4.0|I purchased this camera as a gift for my Nephew, he is a Lego Nut, his entire room is Lego.  Although the handling took several days longer then advertised and the gift was a couple of days late, he loved it and didn't mind the lateness. He is a very intelligent 7 year old and for the first time in his young life I truly suprised him, he did not know they made such a camera, he just loves it. His mother is an avid photographer and she told me the camera takes excellent pictures and easy to download to computer.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|We lost something of our wonder and fear about the great natural world around us when we insulated ourselves from it.  Don't get me wrong - I like all the creature comforts and technology, not least because it is what has allowed me to see this wonderful Norwegian movie.  They have brought us back to the old stories, the old fears, while also providing us excellent entertainment, too.  Not a false step made throughout this whole movie.  I can't compare it to anything else because it's such an old story, brought into our modern world so well.  A few points:  -- Norway is incredibly beautiful.  -- Otto Jespersen is what John Wayne would have been, if he had been a Norwegian comedian. Just saying.  Only Jespersen can convey more by just standing there than Wayne, as much as I enjoy his acting, ever could.  John Wayne was always portraying himself; of course, he had to.  Jespersen isn't that self-conscious.  He conveys something bigger than himself.  This is why you can see what he is seeing.  This is why when he's scared, you are absolutely terrified.  Excellent casting and directing.  -- The trolls...they're really there.  Just unbelievably good effects.  -- Favorite scene:  the calm discussion of troll history and habits in the diner, with normal people having normal conversations in the background and not noticing anything weird at all.  -- Did I mention Norway is incredibly beautiful?  Also, this story is told so well, that when they tell you some trolls live inside mountains and then cut away to a shot of a rocky mountain...you see them in there, in your mind.   Just like in the old days, that's where they really exist.  It's wonderful.  Thank you for making this movie!
B005NNURES|1.0|I simply have to bash this one. I love Pink Floyd and recognize that even their bleakest albums have quality in them but Roger Water's egomaniacal trip on this one sure leaves a mark and an annoying one; thus, it is no surprise that this was his last collaboration with Pink Floyd. Despite Waters' inarguable merits and contributions the story goes that the man's obnoxious, despotic, and petulant ways were intensifying with the passing of time and this was the culmination. Guitar virtuoso David Gilmore is muffled through the entire album and everyone else basically doesn't exist for, with the exception of \\"Not Now John\\", the album's instrumentation is so lame and sub-par that many tracks verily qualify as songs. Apparently Walters just wanted people to hear his voice and lyrics.   It also seems like a postscript of The Wall which also was a fluff heavy and over rated album which at least, contrary to this one, was saved by a couple of key songs. In conclusion, this album is mediocre and given Pink Floyd's potentials, a capricious nonsense if not an insult to the band. Pink Floyd's 1987 album A Momentary Lapse of Reason was Gilmore's subsequent response without Waters. It not only was a much better album, it made clear who Pink Floyd's musical pillar really was.
B004OBQQPY|4.0|There are documentaries and then there are documentaries, Senna is the latter.  It is no less than any gripping movie and keeping F1 in mind, very fast paced.  The nature of F1 requires the driver to be out of the ordinary with a degree of stubbornness, some luck and a lot of skill and like all F1 champions Senna had all of these qualities.  My personal interest in F1 started in the era of Shumacher and his utter dominance.  Although some of his acts may cast doubt on Shumacher's level of fairness to the sport but he will also remain one of the great drivers in the history of motorsport and there obviously are a handful of others.  But after watching Senna and irregularly reading about him on the net this movie has revived his greatness particularly for all those who have interest in F1.  The movie tells you that Senna was 'speed' at a time when technology and safety features were going through a transition in F1.    The research conducted to get the material and put it together in the right chronological order is praiseworthy.  His death played a key role in taking his level many notches up but it does not mean that he was not a great driver.  He was a storm in F1 which came, saw and conquered like Alexander.  The movie is worth watching and thoroughly entertaining.
0385534639|3.0|The story stared out OK, but got very draggy in the middle and towards the end. I really didn't care of I finished it or not, lost interest in the characters and storyline. Too much time in which nothing happened, and the vagueness of the story never quite held my interest.
0553801473|3.0|Resentments are brought on oneself, most often.  I bought this book after going through \\"A Feast of Crows\\" and re-reading A Clash\\" and \\"A Storm,\\" suffering through the interminable waiting.  I, like many of you, was happily excited on learning that \\"A Dance\\" had hit the bookseller's shelves.  But then, now about half way through the book, the expectations have turned to resentments.  And some of this resentment can be fairly laid at the foot of Mr. Martin.<br /><br />If I met the author on the street my question to him would be, \\"Why are all your characters in \\"A Dance With Dragons,\\" stuck in aspic?  Why are they all seemingly incapable of getting anything done?  They go here, they go there and back to there and here again like music CD's permanently set on \\"repeat.\\"<br /><br />Maybe it is just moi but I don't think so, as other reviewers have touched on the same frustrating development.  Is it because a decision has been made to extend A Story of Ice and Fire to at least seven volumes, readers be damned, thus the necessity of stringing things out and out and out.<br /><br />For some unfathomable reason I guess my expectations concerning \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" were way off.  I had thought we would start to see some resolution for at least some of the characters.  Instead we get more Saturday afternoon matin&eacute;e.<br /><br />Alas!
0385534639|5.0|Captivating and a total pleasure to read, \\"The Night Circus\\" left me spell-bound. Romance, not lust, illusionists creating enchantment, not bursting your bubble, what a pleasure to read.  A BIG FIVE STARS!!
B004JUTFH6|5.0|Love this CD and keep replaying it. Although I do not speak French, I enjoy the songs that are sung in French just as well as I enjoy the ones in English. Fabulous band and I hope they tour Stateside soon!
