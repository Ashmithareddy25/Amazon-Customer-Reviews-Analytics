0553579908|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy series I have ever read.  I found that it moved very well for a 900 page book.  There were no 5 page descriptions of a room or someone's clothes.  The book also does a good job of touching our emotions.  I will say that Goodkind and Jordan get unfair comparisons with this book. Their books were just as good at this point, it was when they decided to extend the series to far that the books began to stumble.  I don't think Martin will have that problem if he keeps his series to six books.
B00008H2LE|5.0|The first time i listened to this album i was a bit disapointed because i was looking for something just alike HT. But i listened to it again and was blown away at the musical perfection of this album. Chester's singing is fenominalon this cd. It really shines in Easier To Run, Breaking The Habit, and Lying from You. The guitar in the chourse of Lying From You is amazing! I cant get it out of my head! If you like any of Linkin Park, please cheak out this album. IT'S A MUST!!!
B00006AW2G|5.0|Let It Bleed by The Rolling Stones is one of the best albums ever made no question about it. (Might even be the best album ever made, maybe.) From it's rocking sometimes pretty music to its awesome sometimes raunchy lyrics to Mick Jagger's great piercing vocals, everything about this album is top-notch. Plus the remastering makes all the songs sound perfectly clear and this is definitely one of the better-sounding albums out there. Now to be fair Midnight Rambler and You Got the Silver have never quite grown on me, but the rest of the songs especially Monkey Man are just so great and the whole album flows so brilliantly that it is just an awesomely glorious listening experience. This is one album that I enthusiastically enjoy each and every time I'm in the mood to listen to it and this along with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon has made me want to get pretty badly a multi-channel-compatible DVD player with SACD capability just to be able to hear these two albums in it's full glory. I believe all in all DVD's don't necesarrily give you the best picture and sound-quality, because as long as you have a great TV connected to a rocking stereo system that all movies will look and sound great even in the VHS format, but SACD players are way too pricey by themselves and it's cheaper to get the capability with a DVD player than without one, so I'd love to get one anyway. Never understood why DVD's are the wave of the future when VHS is just as good, but I guess because they're less bulky and they have extras is why people love them so much. Also everyone knows that we're all sheep anyway, right? And just like to follow the crowd. Anyway, please just get this album, all right? It is simply fantastic, a masterpiece, and highly recommended to all.

B00008H2LB|4.0|My first impressions of this album are that I am glad that they released a cd of new music especially after the remix album. The rock parts of the cd seem heavier than Hybrid Theory. The songs also do not seem to be as catchy as hybrid theory. Other than that they used the same formula that seems to be working for them. There are no drastic changes in the way their music sounds.
0671027344|5.0|\\"The Perks..\\" is such a wonderfully great book, after i read it i just fell in love with the main character.  I liked how Chbosky used Charlie's letters to a friend to tell the his story, this way of writing reminded me of a another great book i have read \\"the Color Purple\\".  After reading the book it left me feeling like i personally know Charlie and all of the other characters in the book, of all the books i have read i sometimes disagree with the endings but the ending in this book was an exception.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Now out of all of Pac's albums this would be my favorite. I feel it is the love child between Me Against the World and All Eyez On Me. This was basically his war album. He declares war against several other rappers and thats just in the intro. This album also is the main fuel to the 2pac alive rumors. I think he is dead but that is my opinion. The beats are very good and he really finds lyrics to fit to each song. The songs are deeper than AEOM and that is always a good thing. He goes back to minimal guest appearances with the only ones being members of his group the Outlawz. <BR>STANDOUT TRACKS: Hail Mary<BR>To Live and Die in LA<BR>Toss It Up<BR>Krazy<BR>and Against All Odds
B000001FTA|5.0|This is a really great Thin Lizzy album. Despite the fact that Lizzy had lost Robertson on some of the track  they had been able to hold together for such a good album like this. Although you can't tell Scott Gorham had done some great work on the album without Robertson. Some of the songs like Southbound and Dancin In The Moonlight were already great on this album. If you want Thin Lizzy at their shining moment I would tell you that Nightlife, Fighting, Jailbreak, and Live &amp; Dangerous are your best bets.
B00008H2LE|4.0|To put it nicely, this album was....disappointing. With the hype surrounding the album, I expected every song (or damn-near every song) to be spectacular. While there are a few stand-out tracks like &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, &quot;Lying From You&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, and &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, the rest of the album is simply not worth noting. Now don't get me wrong, I still (and probably always will be) a LP fan and will continue to listen to Meteora. All I'm saying is that it doesn't even come close to touching Hybrid Theory (but, contrary to popular belief, there REALLY is so many times that you can hear &quot;In the End&quot; and still keep your sanity) :-P
B00004SZWD|5.0|&quot;Songs to the Key of Life&quot; is one of those unique albums (yes, I have the LP) in which almost every song could stand on its own. The variety and inventive melodies, effects, verses are just outstanding.  What &quot;makes&quot; this album is not only the SW's odd, throaty voice but the arrangements themselves - simultaneously musical, exciting, poetic and of a refined caliber rarely seen today.  Perhaps what I am praising is the excellence of the work itself, the attention to detail.  <br />As for favorites, one could as easily choose &quot;Black Man&quot;, &quot;Isn't she Lovely?&quot;, &quot;As&quot;, &quot;I am Singing&quot;....all are superb.  The only sad thing about the release of this album is that SW never again approched its artistic excellence.  How do you top the best?
B00008H2LB|5.0|ok  well after nearly three years it's out the new cd from linkin park! Now  i bought this cd the same day it came out and have probably listened to it 20 times sense then, and i have to say it is the best cd i have heard in a long time.Linking park are as great as ever, although  some of the songs are a bit diffrentfrom there previous cd and some of the tracks might not be considered radio ready but that dosent make them anyless Amazing. Chester's and mikes vocals are amazing throughout the cd and  the rest of the band does an awesome job on the music. If you are like me and have been listening to there first cd Hybred Theory for the last three years this cd will take a couple of listens to get used to but once you do your hooked, this is a new linkin park they are more mature and there lyrics and music reflect that  but dont worry they are still a kick...band and for u people who are reading this and saying  i dont wanna buy that because they have changed some. dont worry there are still some tracks that sound like they did on the first cd, \\"somewhere i belong\\" \\"faint\\" and a couple others. but if your ready to try something a little diffrent then  just take  a listen to \\"easier to run\\", \\"breaking the habit\\" and \\"numb\\" u will love them. this is an amazing cd and it was worth the wait.!
B00003CX9E|5.0|The print of the film is beautiful.  I have been watching it off videotape for years - I wouldn't have guessed that the film image is that crisp and detailed.  Stunning.<br />The PBS documentary on the battle over the film, between Welles and William Randolph Hearst, is fascinating entertainment in its own right.  A wonderful and truly interesting documentary.  Pairing it with the definitive copy of the film, at minimal cost to consumers, is a great idea.<br />The audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich is reasonably interesting, and the audio commentary by Roger Ebert is especially deep and enjoyable.<br />For those who don't know, the movie itself is brilliant.  It exemplifies every element of what can make a film great : psychological depth, skillfully constructed screenplay, real human emotion and depth, great characters, great acting, great cinematography, real level of quality and ambition.  This DVD presents it in all its glory as well as supplemental materials that will please any fan and will give anyone new to the film much background as to why this film is frequently listed as the greatest of all time.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park shows why they are awesome once again.  This CD is great all the way through. its one of the few that i can play without skipping any tracks. Somewhere i belong was a great one for the first single. another of the greats on the album is numb. You want this CD!
B00007E8V4|4.0|I bought this album and I couldn't wait to get it.  When I did I realized that System of a Down, my favorite band, was way better then I thought!  The tracks are political, like Toxicity, which is what I like because I'm way into speaking my mind...This was a good album!  BUY,BUY,BUY!
B00008H2LB|1.0|This CD [smells] and so does Linkin Park.  They have no talent and are so overrated.  Please buy something worth while...
B000084T18|5.0|this cd goes down as one of my greatest. When i gets tired a hearin \\"go shorty\\" i go to some random track and it's hot for the next week. The cd has endless titles that laydown a mellow beat that the ladies like but still gets us playas amped up......in his own words, \\"G-unit, r u ready?????\\"
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was the definition of made for radio wanna be hard rock that has no real emotion or soul to it.  \\"Meteora\\" continues this trend, and by the time this review is published the album will most likely have gone platinum.  This time around the album is packed full of poorly sampled blips and sounds that are mixed in with the more annoying than usual rapping, repetitive down tuned guitars, and inconsistent drumming that people the world over have grown to love.  Chester Bennington, who I had said before had a unique voice and is quite talented, sounds tired and plain old uninspired here, and the band is so poorly knit that it is plainly clear that \\"Meteora\\" was released just to make money and get on the radio.  This isn't hard rock.  This isn't metal.  And none of these guys are Mike Patton (the other vocalist whose name slips my memory seems to try to mimic him more and more).  Linkin Park is only part of a trend.....
B00007KMP1|5.0|Since all the other reviews here deal with the CD version I will review the SACD. The music quality quality here as everyone else pretty well has agreed upon is very involving. Depressing but beautiful. The SACD uses the rear channels mainly for the orchestra and sound effects and the center channel to anchor the front main channels. Once you hear the SACD you will never listen to the stereo CD again. The quality is one of the best that I have heard and this music fits the surround mode perfectly. The lushness cannot be adequately conveyed while being compressed into 2 speakers. With the surround version you are sitting in the middle of the performance and the speakers fall away leaving you to absorb the musical experience. Once again, stereo is dead and so are regular CD's. Long live SACD and DVD Audio!!!
B00008H2LB|4.0|This album is different from the original Hybrid Theory but still has songs that reflect the hits of old. There are track that sound remarkable as others don't quite live up to my standards of this band.  But you can tell the elements of instrument talent have risen.  Mike's vocals are incredible his hip hop lyrics are incredible.  Along with Chester's great voice still remains as raw.  It wasn't as great as I hoped but still turns out to be a great album.  Check out the track Don't stay.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park is great in my mind.  They have what seems like infinite depth. The difference between Chester singing and Mike rapping exemplifies all the levels that their music reaches.<br />Hybrid theory was a breakthrough album that surprised me and I think everyone else who listened through it all the way for the first time.  Its only problem was that it was so short.<br />With the production of Reanimation, Linkin Park remixed Hybrid Theory with a twist throwing down Hip Hop beats for most songs.  It was great, and like Hybrid Theory I was surprised, in this case because I didn't expect them to be able to transform their old songs so drastically while still keeping the essence and attitude the originals had.<br />Now with the release of Meteora I was expecting a combination of Hybrid Theory's precision with Reanimation's length and style.  Although I really do love the album, it is just too short.  I bought the album, which at this point is a rare thing, and I don't regret it, but every time the album finishes, I really want more.  I think all of the songs on the album are more or less flawless.  Overall it isn't as intense as Hybrid Theory, but it packs a punch that not many other bands can match.<br />Props to Linkin Park because I think they really do put a lot into their music and because the final products thus far have been polished and awesome.  They are one of my favorite bands but they need to start filling up their CD's.  If you liked Hybrid Theory you will like Meteora just as much, but don't be dissapointed to see the length of the disc.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Hybrid Theory is a tough act to follow. It is, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums of all time. It would have been near impossible to come out with an album better than Hybrid Theory, but they got damn close. This is a great album, with a lot of dope beats. My favorite songs are \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" (the one they play on the radio),\\"Faint, and \\"Easier To Run\\", although the whole album is tight. Buy it as soon as you can! It is probably the best $...you can spend.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Upon first listen, Linkin Park's sophomore (not including Reanimation)release didn't have much of an impact on me. There were no standout tracks that made me want to replay them. The reason for this, I believe, is that all the songs sound somewhat identical to the lead off single \\"Somewhere I Belong\\". They all for the most part are mid tempo songs with rapped verses and screamed choruses. There are a couple songs where Chester is lead throughout. On track #2, Mike doesn't even make an appearance. But after that, he is the main guy, which is cool cause his rhymes really shine as always.<br />Meteora is definitely more \\"Reanimation\\" than it is \\"Hybrid Theory\\". That's not a bad thing, I'm just giving you something to relate to. <br />For the most part, every song starts off with a sample. It seems to me that they were more concerned with making cool samples rather than giving each song it's own touch and sound and dynamics. The samples honestly seem to have replaced Brad Delson's guitars. The hard guitars are still there, but the samples are definitely the base of mostly all the songs.<br />I'm not hatin' or anything, I think Linkin Park is a great band and I think Mike Shinoda is an awesome talent. He's gonna be a great producer some day. <br />This isn't a bad review. It's just a review from a reviewer who was expecting a little more. Speaking of a little more... the worse part about this album? It ends at only 36 minutes! What's that all about?!? There're 13 tracks. The first track is just noise. And the rest are \\"full\\" (I put \\"full\\" because a couple of the songs are under 3 minutes, that's kinda jipping the fans I think) songs including one instrumental. <BR>Die hard fans will love this album of course. Others will just like it.
0375758992|5.0|Do you know how sometimes, when people write memoirs, they write their childhood as if they were wise and had the perspective they have now, then? And how people tend to gloss over the faults and idiosyncracies of their family members, or, worse yet, magnify and dwell on them for effect? Alexandra Fuller does neither. She presents us with a picture of a real family living in 'interesting times'.  She makes no excuses for her parents' obvious prejudice, and somehow, despite it, I found myself liking them. <br />Read this book if you like reading non-fiction and/or memoirs. Or if you have an interest in recent (well... in the last 30 years, anyway) African history.
0316666343|2.0|After hearing several reviews from friends and family, I couldn't wait to get my own copy.  Luckily, I didn't have to buy it myself - a good friend, who was also unimpressed with the book, lent it to me.  While an easy read and not totally boring, it was not the emotional and exciting journey I was guaranteed.
B00000IAU3|3.0|Like most people, I first heard Dido when her infamous verse from \\"Thank You\\" was used as the chorus for Eminem's \\"Stan\\". I don't really think people were paying attention to her when she dropped \\"Here With Me\\", but after the full-length \\"Thank You\\" came out, it became a hit, and people then started buying the album.<br />Dido has a good voice for her music, and as I look at her material, I think that in time she may be able to reach Tori Amos levels of stardom. But I'm not necessarily comparing her to Tori because Dido's songs are more accessible. There are a lot of good songs on here like \\"Don't Think Of Me\\" and \\"My Lover's Gone\\", as well as \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Here With Me\\".<br />I'm not sure if I'm completely feeling \\"Slide\\"; also, I think \\"All You Want\\" and \\"I'm No Angel\\" could have been rewritten a few times. But this is still a good album. Whenever Dido releases a new album, I'll pick it up.
B00008H2LB|5.0|A lot of bands have been hit hard by the sophomore jinx, Linkin Park is not one of them.  Meteora is an absolutely amazing album.  LP has refined their nearly perfect sound and released the best album since Disturbed's &quot;Believe.&quot;  Unlike Disturbed, however, LP hasn't changed their sound, they are still the same Linkin Park from Hybrid Theory.  The complex samples by Mr. Hahn and the amazing vocal combination of Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda that have come to define LP's sound are still there, along with the exremely complicated druming of Rob Bourdin, the overlooked talent of Guitarist Brad Delson, and the always underappriciated bass guitar played by Phoenix.  That being said, pick up &quot;Meteora,&quot; it is quite possibly the best album in the rap-rock genre, aside from &quot;Hybrid Theory,&quot; which it could surpass after more times through.  Let me give you the run-through of the songs:<BR>1.Foreward - a 13 sec. intro<BR>2.Don't Stay - 5/5 - a hard hitting opener that accurately shows the sound of this album...possibly my favorite song<BR>3.Somewhere I Belong - 5/5 - The first single from this album, I wasn't a huge fan of the song when I first heard it, but it has certainly grown on me.  Mr. Hahn's samples are amazing in this song.<BR>4.Lying From You - 5/5 - Another hard hitting song that displays Joseph Hahn's talent.  Chester's vocals on this song are great and have a lot of emotion.<BR>5.Hit the Floor - 4/5 - As the band says, this song is &quot;heavy with a hip-hop bounce,&quot; and it is.  The vocals are mostly by Mike, with Chester in the background.<BR>6.Easier to Run - 4/5 - A song with a softer sound, reminiscent of &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; on Hybrid Theory.  Check out the complex drums by Rob, they are awesome.<BR>7.Faint - 5/5 - Fast paced song with heavy guitars.<BR>8.Figure.09 - 5/5 - Another heavy song with a great guitar riff.<BR>9.Breaking the Habit - 5/5 - Great song that is mostly Chester singing over Mr. Hahn's scratchs and samples.  It's a sound different from the rest of the album, but it fits well.<BR>10.From the Inside - 4/5 - Signature LP sound, soft verses with a heavy chorus.<BR>11.Nobody's Listening - 4/5 - Probably the oddest song on the album, It's Chester and Mike singing over samples and a japanese flute.  <BR>12.Session - 3/5 - I'm not a huge fan of the insturmentals, so this is probably my least favorite song.  The samples and scratches are extremely complex, however, so you have to restect the talent involved.<BR>13.Numb - 5/5 - Funny how my favorite songs are the ones that begin and end the CD.  Numb is a great closure to a great CD.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park's newest album, Meteora, is a fantastic follow up to their debut album Hybrid Theory.  Meteora delivers a slightly different sound than Hybrid Theory; it's more melodic.  The guitar riffs sound heavier and and deliver 13 songs that bring out this slightly different from Linkin Park.  Again an excellent follow-up, but not quite as good as Hybrid Theory.  Any Linkin Park fan and any rock fan alike should pick up this album.  4 out of 5 stars; an excellent album!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Wow, what can I say,...these guys did it again. Mixing the same--yet fresh--formula, they came up with Meteora this time. I must admit that I wasn't one of their fans, but if you shared a room with your brother who constantly played &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; in his CD player, sooner or later you'll get hooked, and that's my case! So far, I instantly fell in love with their first single from this album, &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, and &quot;Easier to Run&quot; (reminds me of &quot;In the End&quot;), and &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; (with its exceptional drum-beats and almost melodic tune). Other songs are not so catchy, anyway. Hence the four stars. But I have only listened to them less than ten times by now, so maybe I just have to listen more to get them grow on me. Maybe I'll ask my brother to play this CD more often (well, I hardly have to do so!). BTW, I'll wait to buy my copy until they released a special edition with amazing track(s) like \\"My December\\". :) But if you are a Linkin Park fan, I'm sure I can't ask you to wait anymore, can I?
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Parks new album Meteora, while short at about 36 minutes long, delivers a slightly harder, more melodic sound than their debut album Hybrid Theory.  This is overall a great album with very engaging tunes and a CD that you can listen to all the through without skipping a track but and is an excellent follow up to Hybrid Theory.  Meteora is a good experiment with a slightly different sound but falls slightly short of Hybrid Theory.  I give it 4/5 stars.  An excellent album!
B00006JJ1O|1.0|I suppose every year needs a flimsy pop record for people to dance to. The very fact that the hype over their sexual orientation overshadows the music should serve as a dead giveaway that these two girls are about selling records more than making music of any lasting importance. Having said that, this is disposable pop at its most crass. Turning the Smiths jangle-pop classic \\"How soon is now\\" into a mindless Euro-dance track is not only a travesty, it's rather ironic given what the song was originally written about. Subtract out the pouts, contrived hype, and cheesy beats, and your left with a disc I suspect will be easy to find in the used bin in 6  months.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Every time I think of Christina Aguilera I think of Andy Dick's impression of her cousin's neighbor's daughter's friend....  I got hooked on \\"Beautiful\\" and didn't realize what depth CAguilar has in her voice.  Very enjoyable, although I think she tries a little hard to fit into the hip-hop scene.  She could sing any genre she wanted!  I'll be keeping this one in the disc player along with Pink's Mizundastood.
B000001DYD|3.0|Released in 1993. Polly Jean Harvey and her band released Rid Of Me. A Follow-up to the critically aclaimed Dry. Like Dry. Rid Of Me is a low budget , raw and angry album. Though different in the sence that the album is a lot harder and agressive. <br />Rid Of Me is a mixed album. It has some great songs on it but other not so great. Many critics,fans and the singer herself didn´t like the album like they loved Dry many feal Rid Of Me rank right up there with her other albums.<br />Personally I was never big fan of Dry and found it overall a soddy album that only included about 5 or 6 good songs.<br />Rid Of Me falls into the same thing. Recorded in just few days under the guidence of Steve Albini who recorded it mostly live in the studio focused more of making it angry, raw than actually something to fell special about. <br />Most of the songs are a bit punkish and even some people call this grunge album. Steve Albini did In Utero with Nirvana around the same time.<br />The songwriting unlike Dry is a bit more mainstream as the grunge was at it´s peak. Rid Of Me wasn´t however a huge commercial hit except for in the UK. In The US it peaked respectively at no. 158 on the billboard 200.<br />this album recieves 6.5 out of 10 for good promising start and good songs in between but overall the album isn´t very good as a whole and often it´s annoying to hear it as well as Steve Albini´s poor production I sometimes can´t hear what´s she´s singing about.
B00008H2LB|5.0|&quot;Meteora&quot; is a lot like Linkin Park's fist Album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. This is a good thing because Hybrid Thoery is a great album. If you're a Linkin Park fan you probably have this CD already and you probably really like it. And if you're not a Linkin Park fan, why not? If you like the first single &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; you'll definitley like this CD. My favorite tracks are; Don't Stay, Somewhere I Belong, Lying From You, Hit the Floor, Easier to Run, Figure.09, and Nobody's Listening. Well that's almost all the songs but that's because all the songs are good. Bottom Line, I don't care who you are, where you're from, or anything else, you should get this CD!
B000001E7T|5.0|in 1995 PJ. Harvey released her groubreaking third album To Bring You My Love. Very different from its predicessors. She leaves the noice and punk rock out and gives us amazingly well produced , well played and thought out masterpiece. Combined with great guitar riffs, organs, bells and haunting lyrics and soaring vocals of PJ Harvey. To Bring You My Love is one of hell a good album. The 10 songs are amazing. <br />To Bring You My Love. Strong opening track, A Slow but energetic songs that you can´t get out of your head. The guitar in the beginning is amazing and then her soaring vocals and these words comming out of her words that gives the song such a new meaning. 10/10.<br />Meet Ze Mosta. Another fantastic track. Song which is kind of electronic. And her singing is awesome as well as the lyrics. amazing track 10/10.<br />Working For The Man. A song that I heard on the radio but dismissed it. Now i can´t get enough of it. one of the best songs on the album. Though I Can´t hear what she´s saying it is awesome. the drums and the basslines are awesome 10/10. <br />C´mon Billy. More regonizable songs on this album. A Great track. Acoustic guitar and PJ´s electric and sad voice and amazing string arrangements. 10/10<br />Teclo. Hard to explain it. Another amazing song. 10/10.<br />Long Snake Moan. One Of The Heavy songs on this album. Great song 9/10<br />Down By The Water. The big single of the album. A Fantastic track that . Contains one of the greatest lyrics ever written.<br />I Think I´m A Mother. A Slow track that is angry and energetic. One Of the greatest songs on this album. It´s beautifully written and performed curiously and amizingly well by the people that worked on it. 10/10<br />Send His Love To Me. Somewhat similar Come On Billy. 9/10<br />The Dancer. A Great tune. Acoustic guitars, strings, organs and violins, great voice, lyrics, well written track 10/10.<br />To Bring You My Love is a great album filled with some amazing stuff that nobody should overlook. It brought her the first commercial sucess and she was nominated for numerous awards. Critics applaud the album and Rolling Stone magazine named it the album of the year ( I don´t like that Magazine by the way)and many others hailed it a masterpiece and is easily in the top 5 albums of that year and top 10 albums of the 1990´s
B00006CJOY|1.0|I like Manu Chao, but I did not like this CD.  If you are looking for the song 'Bongo Bong' (or any other particular Manu Chao song you may like) don't bother with this CD.  All the songs are drowned in 'hey, hey, hey, hey'.  If someone had played this version of the song for me, I would not have guessed it was the same song - it's that bad.  Now I finally understand what my high school english teacher meant by a 'cacaphonous din'...
B00008H2LE|4.0|This album actually didn't disappoint for a follow-up album to hybrid theory [which went platinum and was on the radio for 2 years]. Reassuring Linkin Park didn't turn away from their sound. The whole cd is based on rap/rock/tables type music. There are some serious head turners on the cd as well, Somewhere I Belong, Easier to Run, and Faint are the songs that really grab me as the highlights of the CD. For those of you thinking about buying this album, its not far from hybrid theory but there are some seriously intriquing beats. A definite must have for a rock fans cd collection.
B00008H2LE|4.0|After having listened to Linkin Park's earlier album - [HYBRID THEORY], I really wanted to get their new album ( Meteora ). I had great expectations for their latest album and after listening to all the tracks on it, I have to say that the song that captured my attention the most was &quot;Figure .09&quot;......the ending portion of the song held great similarity to that of &quot;One Step Closer&quot;....from their previous album. Other than that......&quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; is still my favourite song from &quot;Meteora&quot; and I'm sure that I'll start to like other songs from this album. Maybe, I just have to listen to it a few more times. Hopefully it doesn't prove me wrong!
B000002KDX|5.0|I've been collecting the original America albums recently.  Many are imports, but readilly available.  I've also been reading up on the group and I've come to really appreciate this album.  Why?  This was music created by three very talented musicians and composers with &quot;fire in the belly&quot;- these songs were practiced in their car, this is prior to George Martin who would transform them into an extremely good pop music 1970's band.  They were perfectionists in those days (George Martin would later encourage them to not be quite so &quot;picky&quot;).  Horse with no name, I Need You and Sandman were well known to me and appreciated.  Three Roses, never Found the Time, Donkey Jaw, etc. are all wonderful songs that I had never heard.  I'd love to hear a good live version of the opening track &quot;Riverside&quot; - its a great song, but it feels like it needs to be longer than 3 minutes.  The only song I don't like is Pigeon Song, but 11 great songs out of 12 is pretty good for three military kids in England trying to get their foot in the door.  The America web-site gives a lot of very interesting information about the band.  I'd skip all of the &quot;Best of...&quot; stuff and start collecting the original albums - you won't want to miss any of this if you get started.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I bought this cd last night expecting another great set of powerful music, similar to Hybrid Theory. I was wrong. <br />The whole album is only 36 minutes long. They filled the other 300mb on the cd with useless multimedia for PC. The only song that really begs to be played more then once is the single &quot;Somewhere I Belong.&quot; I'm sure I'll be sick of that after it's played 8 million times on the radio. The songs just don't flow. Maybe it's just me, but this isn't the Linkin Park from Hybrid Theory.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I bought this for the song &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; and that was about it. I was disapointed by the bands first cd and didn't expect to be really moved by this one. But this cd is a step in the right direction with harder hitting beats and lyrics that I can relate to more. I was supprised by this outting. Other songs that cought my attention are &quot;Lying From You&quot;, &quot;Hit the floor&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Breaking The Habit&quot;, &quot; Nobody's Listening&quot;, and &quot;Sessionn.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is my favorite movie of all, sharing the place with Moulin Rouge. I don't know how to explain how wonderful it is. The music is amazing, the performances are perfect, the plot is great, the dance numbers are absolutely wonderful, in summary it's PERFECT!!!! I looooooove all kinds of musicals, but I love this the most. And even if you don't like musicals, you will love this movie. I know people who hate musicals, but loved this movie. The fact that it's based in a real musical, makes it already perfect, I mean that they had adapted a theatre play into a movie, and not a simple movie, a great movie is almost unbelievable. Catherine, Rene, Richard and Latifah, all give such wonderful performances. Catherine is a great singer and dancer, and Rene too. I think this movie really deserves all the awards it has recieved, and the fact that it won 6 Oscars, including Best Supporting Actress for Catherine and of course Best Movie, proves it. If you haven't seen it, go and watch it, you can be sure you will love it, and if you don't you have a really big problem.
B00008H2LE|4.0|This album was not quit as good as their last album, Hybrid Theory, but then again what can beat that.<br /> With that being said I still recommend that all Linkin Park fans run out and buy this ASAP.
B00008H2LB|1.0|All you posers that like this putrid music are insanely ignorant. This is horrible \\"music\\" with very little musical skill, and whiny crybaby lyrics to boot.Not only are they the most horrible live band ever, but they whine in EVERY song. Why would anyone want to listen to this disgusting insult of a band? Go pick up a Slayer, Vader, or Morbid Angel album. If that's too brutal for you (which it probably will be) then go pick up a Dream Theater or Tool album. That is good music which requires skill and precision to pull off. LINKIN PARK [...]
B00008H2LE|5.0|the intros are odd but the over all songs are great the best LP better than H.T.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Quite simply, the best 5.1 music mix I have ever heard. You are sat in the middle of an amazing album being played.
055357342X|5.0|...Simply incredible.  I finished it yesterday and rather bummed out that it's over.  It amazes me how well Martin is able to engage the reader and keep a 1000+ page book (if only it were 2000+) entertaining throughout.  There has been nary a dull moment throughout the entire series, including the beginning of Game of Thrones.  This book admittedly has perhaps a few more slow bits  than the other books and Martin continues to evince a bit of TMI (too much information) Syndrome (something a certain other author seems to suffer from mightily).  For instance, he goes into great detail in describing various carnal acts, such as describing what sound a (fill in the blanks) ___ makes when it comes out of a ___.  Amazingly, however, this doesn't detract from the story.  Martin is able to maintain the narrative flow despite his generously detailed prose.  If anything, the author's descriptions, no matter how gratuitous some of them may seem, only enhance his story, they don't bog it down.  Some are better than gratuitous, of course, and incredibly vivid; the details of the wilding hordes, for example.  In short, Martin never bores the reader.<br />As far as whether a Song of Ice and Fire is better than Lord of the Rings, however... well, I thought so myself for a while, but I'm not sure it's as simple as that.  Certainly, Martin's work has more depth and is overall more entertaining, I think.  But as far as strength of historical richness(via the Silmarillion), mystique and use of language, I'd say Tolkien is still king.  But Martin isn't far behind in these categories either.  And I wouldn't be surprised to see Martin further detail the history of the lands of Westeros and beyond in future (post Song of Ice and Fire) works.  <br />But right now, we have the unbelievable Song of Ice and Fire series.  Put down that Wheel of Time Book and pick up Game of Thrones.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this album was great, the first single is very catchy, and even though meteora might not sell like hybrid theory, that is not a feat accomplished every time.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I love this album! I felt that the last linkin' park cd had a few dull tracks, but tis album is perfect!
B00008H2LE|5.0|the album is pretty good. Even though the single works, cwraling, in the end, and O.S.C.will always come first.
B00008H2LE|5.0|good cd, if you liked hybrid theory but didn't like reanimation then i think you will still like this (i like all three). track one is just an intro like on reanimation, so it should only be considered to have 12 songs on it. &quot;Session&quot; is like the cure for the itch songs on the other two CDs, it has no lyrics or words. i think it's safe to say the band has changed a bit since hybrid theory, but not much, when you here it you can definitely tell it's linkin park.<br />the lyrics are still sometimes negitive and angry but there's still no profanity.<br />the dvd was interesting and sometimes funny, about a half an hour long. it's about making meteora and how they made some of the music.<br />good cd, i'm glad to see lp still writing and look foreward to another cd.
B00008H2LB|1.0|If you thought they're first album was as heavy, sincere, intense, and groundbreaking as it gets, wait 'till ya hear this one!<br />If you thought they're first album was as contrived, monotonous, and just plain obnoxious and annoying as it gets, wait 'till ya hear this one!<br />This is more of the same, whatever your opinion of it may be. (I, of course, am of the latter.) Hey, at least they're consistent. Can't say that much for Metallica!
076790382X|5.0|I read this book last summer at my apartments pool. It was embarassing. I couldn't help lauging outloud. I must have looked like a total idiot. After reading In a Sunburneed Country (great) and Walk in the Woods (great) I had to read anything this guy wrote which led to those awkward looks at my local pool. Bryson had grown up in the states but moved to England for 20 or so years and then recently moved back to the U.S. He was writing for a local U.S. newspaper about the difference between America and England, and also about the differences between America now and America 20 years ago. He decided to publish these into a book. Every story is 3 to 4 pages and funny. This is a perfect book just to pick up once in a while and read a passage. Or you can just devour it down like I did. I have read Bryson's \\"The lost continent\\" which was great even though it was written 20 years ago and I read \\"Mother Tongue\\" which if you ever wanted to know the history of the English language this is your book. Although crammed with info Bryson actually makes something so hard to read funny.  One of my lifes dreams is to have Bill Bryson take me on a vacation.
B00004U2GH|5.0|At one point on this album, Cash says something to the effect of, &quot;when you put the screws on me, I'll screw you!&quot; and the inmates cheer. It's a nonchalant remark that reveals much about Cash and why we listen to him. The album is full of bits like this that show why Johnny Cash is one of the greatest American musicians of all time; he appears both God-like and authentically human, merging the boldest, yet most personal, aspects of each. Thank you, Mr. Cash.
0385504209|5.0|At my local library. There is a guy that reviews books and he knows I like his picks. He actually walked up to me and handed me this book. He said this book is great. When he says a book is incredible his batting avearge is 1000. So i am 10 pages into this book and I am like oh my god this is great. I love to read historical books and I love to find out how things were named. You actually learn from this book. You learn about how Friday the 13th got named. You learn about Fibonuci numbers. You learn about the great life of Leonardi Davinci. Once you get to the part where he talks about the picture of &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and you go look at the actual painting. You will be amazed. Don't read to many reviews of the actual story because it will ruin the fun of this book. And after your done you can go to Dan Brown.com and his website has pictures of all the great museums and paintings that are in this book.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I have the other 2 Linkin Park cds and absolutely adore them.  I've been waiting for forever to get their new cd and got it the day that it came out.  Its a really really really really really great cd w/ a lot of new, great songs that you can really relate to and you cant help but fall in love with this cd.  All of it is just completely AWESOME!!!!!
0375414053|5.0|As a working mother of two girls who are constantly getting colds, demanding Bagel Bites, requiring clean paint brushes and spilling cat food, I completely related to Kate's plight. I haven't been quite as tortured by guilt since I work at home (I may be around, but I do have to rely on TV babysitting when I'm on a deadline), but the combined pressures of work and family have certainly forced me to forget things like where I parked the car and how much money I had in the bank. I hope I can maintain a sense of humor about it all. Reading this novel was a sharing the pain evening for me. I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters Inc. is great -- a near classic -- filled with action and humor. I would have preferred a few quiet moments for character development, and perhaps more suspense. But regardless, my sons (ages 2 and 5) love Monsters, Inc. There's controlled chaos, monsters, and bit of peril and comedy. The kids watch this and they laugh and giggle. And the animation is wonderful.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This CD will be familiar territory if you loved the first CD.  If you didn't like it, or got tired of the original songs really fast, you won't like this.<br />Now, to go into my description of the words &quot;familiar territory.&quot;  A friend told me it sounded exactly like the first one, and he's right in the respect that &quot;Numb&quot; sounds a lot like &quot;Pushing Me Away.&quot;  I think he was disillusioned by the fact that Linkin Park has a hugely distinct sound, and anything they do will sound like they've always sounded.  He mentioned that the CD had the &quot;same beats and riffs&quot; but I strongly disagree with that.  Perhaps the same beats, but how many different tempos can you arrange?  All of Linkin Park's songs have a darkness, half-insanity edge to them, and there's no way to avoid that.<br />I've also been told that for the amount of time they were given to put out a new CD, the shortness of the CD is unacceptable.  I know this is not relevant to the CD itself, but it may help console those who are bitter.  If you buy the limited edition, the CD will be accompanied with a DVD called &quot;The Making of Meteora.&quot;  This shows the time and work put into each song, including the 6 years in-the-making that &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; went through.  I hope this will help those who think the CD is too short realize how confused they are.<br />Personally, I love this CD.  I still love the old one.  If you don't like their sound, you won't like this CD.  But I strongly recommend it, and it will remain up with Hybrid Theory and Reanimation as my top CDs.  The songs remain on the same level as older ones, and indeed have the same style.  That's Linkin Park style, man.
B000000W5L|5.0|Exile on Main Street = (Probably)the greatest rock album ever made. <BR>I'd go on, but after making a statement like that at the beginning of a review there's not much need, is there?<BR>Peace.
B000070WJE|4.0|I'm a Californian and I have all six of Robbie's albums. This one is my #2 favorite (1st is Sing When You're Winning). The song \\"Always and Forever\\" is a beautiful, slow tempo song. \\"Sexed Up\\" is in that same vein; it's kind of sad if you understand what it's really about. If you like songs that are more uppity and pop, try \\"Hot Fudge\\" or \\"Monsoon\\". Great song and lyrics to sing along to! One of my favorite songs on the whole album is \\"Come Undone\\" which is his new single I think. It's very powerful and is true Robbie. The booklet also has cool photos. I hope Robbie tours America very soon!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|I have been a Bruce fan for years.  I often become a bit unsettled when a band brings out a CD many years after their last.  However, Bruce not only delivered an excellent addition to his music, this ranks as one of my top two favorite Bruce albums.<BR>His ability to deliver messages that make you visualize what he is singing about is more evident than ever in this album.  A definite must buy!
0385504209|5.0|This book was awesome! It was an amazing mystey that kept me turning the page. Just when you thought you had figured it out, you were shocked again. I am Catholic and learned so much aout catholism. Probably the best book I have ever read.
B000083C49|4.0|this is the same lenth as the regular dvd called star trek the voyage home only dif is double dvd and extras not on other dvd .<BR>so if u like extras like documentaries and such then this is worth the price otherwise the regular edition is the one too look for because the movie it's self is the same lenth.both 118 min long.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is an epic film, with both great characters and depth of story that will draw you in and leave you not wanting to take your eyes away from the screen. This is a movie on a grand scale from an accomplished master of the craft. A real treat to behold.
B000002VCW|5.0|I first heard Al Stewart when I was about 10 years old (as of this review, I am 24). My father owned a ragged cassette tape of songs copied from the Year of the Cat vinyl LP, which we played in the car and at home quite extensively. Even at such a tender age, I could feel the genuine emotions conveyed through his songs: the sympathetic lamentations of \\"Lord Grenville,\\" the cinematic seclusion of \\"Broadway Hotel,\\" and the haunting remembrance of the title song. As I grew older into my teens, I went through a phase of musical exploration one might expect of someone at that stage of adolescence, seeking much more aggressive and noise-oriented forms of musical expression to placate the confusion of discomforts stirring within me, and thus I ignored the auditory pleasantries of childhood. But when I entered college and came to know myself more maturely, I started feeling a yearning for certain nostalgic facets of my past, and this album was one of them. How wonderful it was to find the CD here on Amazon.com!  Even as I listen to it now, I still find previously unnoticed nuances. Aside from the brilliant music contained on this album, I have also come to recognize how incredible the production was for its time (1976), as well as the usage of rather advanced synthesizers for subtle melodic support. The music itself is compelling in its atmosphere and timelessness, compared to what was then more popular. The guitar solos still ring true with clarity (not to mention the stylistic drum work and bass lines), never meandering away from their purpose, and Al's to-the-point style of singing is comforting like an honest friend.  There are so many exceptional songs on this album, spanning a wide range of places, moods, and even time periods. As a child, \\"Lord Grenville\\" was always my favorite, but now that I am a singer myself, I have grown partial to \\"One Stage Before.\\" Its candid lyrics and dream-like vocal effects speak clearly to a musician's heart. He is truly a modern troubador, exploring love and sadness in equal measure.  Year of the Cat is a classic on so many levels, and while my college peers are content to surrender themselves to more contemporary sounds (as am I when the mood strikes me), it is unfortunate that many of my generation will miss out on this treasure of songs simply because of its \\"antiquity.\\"
B00008H2LE|5.0|I don't know how they did it, but Linkin Park has made an Album that is 100 times better than their very impersive Hybrid Theory.  This album is a must have for any music lover.  It could quite possible be the best album out so far this year.  Meteora has set a high bar for other bands to try and over come.  Let's hope that this is a sign for how music is going to be this year.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I must admit, I don't like Linkin Park.  All their songs sound very similar.  They're overall pretty good, but nothing you want to spend money on.  And to top it all off, this CD is only 35 minutes long.  If you bought Hybrid Theory, and liked it, I suppose you'll buy this one too.  But anyone else, don't buy it.  They really aren't that good.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is truly some of Linkin Park's best work, it give's you more then you need with an awesome sound and great lyrics, it is as good if not better then Hybrid theory. The album has 13 tracks and every single one is as addictive as the track before it. Anyone who has hybrid theory should definately get this cd. And if you love great new music you would be doing yoursef a great injustice if you don't get it. The album has many extras on the enhanced part of the cd and is one of the most  adddictive albums EVER. It shows you that Linkin Park is going places
0385504209|2.0|Don't believe the hype.  This is a poorly written book peopled by unlikely non-characters who don't so much interact as impart (or ask for) information (or disinformation), while chasing after one another at breakneck speeds or making hairbreadth escapes.  If you can stomache sentences like the following - &quot;Everyone in the emergency room gasped at the sight of the half-naked albino offering the bleeding clergyman&quot; - then be my guest.  You have been warned.
0385424736|5.0|In his first courtroom thriller since A Time To Kill, John Grisham tells the story of a young man barely out of law school who finds himself taking on one of the most powerful, corrupt, and ruthless companies in America and exposing a complex, multibillion dollar insurance scam.<br />  In his final semester of law school Rudy Baylor is required to provide free legal advice to a group of senior citizens, and it is there that he meets his first clients, Dot and Buddy Black. Their son, Donny Ray, is dying of leukemia, and their insurance company has flatly refused to pay for his medical treatments. While Rudy is at first skeptical, he soon realizes that the Blacks really have been shockingly mistreated by the huge company,and that he just may have stumbled upon one of the largest insurance frauds anyone's ever seen, and one of the most lucrative and important cases in the history of civil litigation. The problem is, Rudy's flat broke, has no job, hasn't even passed the bar, and is about to go head - to head with one of the best defense attorney's and powerful industries in America.
B00004WG2X|4.0|...the more I like it. This one and the 1995 version are both excellent and I don't favor one over the other. Both are worth viewing. But I just wanted to add a couple of comments: (1) I saw David Rintoul in another movie in which he was lively and sexy, completely different from his Mr. Darcy portrayal, so he is obviously capable of melting just enough to appear human. His stiff and wooden portrayal must have been what he was directed to do. I think.(2) An earlier reviewer objected to Lizzy's comment in the A&E version about falling in love with Mr. Darcy on first seeing Pemberley. That comment was not an invention of Andrew Davies. It was in the book, including Jane's and Lizzy's laughter at Lizzy's facetiousness.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Okay - I'm a huge Linkin Park fan, and I have to admit I was a little apprehensive about the release of their new album. Could it live up to the previous ones? The answer is &quot;HELL YEA!&quot; I personally loved this CD. Its a little more rock and a little less elecronica than Hybrid Theory. Other than their already famous single, &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; - I love &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; and &quot;Easier to Run&quot;. All in all its a great CD, and I recommend it to anyone who has ever thought of or listened to Linkin Park!
B00008LOS1|4.0|Ahh, \\"Deluxe Edition.\\" Record company speak for \\"We've figured out how to make you spend upwards of twenty-five dollars for *the same stuff!* AGAIN!\\" Universal's two-disc Deluxe Edition series has had some great successes and some...well, puzzling entries. Thankfully, this release is largely in the former category, although there are a few important caveats that need to be addressed. Read on...<br />First, let's look at the package: the original album, plus a few period bonuses, plus a good bit of the infamous \\"Young Vic\\" concert which found the band trying out the material live for the first time. One of MCA/Universal's selling points for disc 1--the original album, which the entire world probably has seven or eight times over at least--is that the disc uses FOR THE FIRST TIME the \\"Original Master Tapes.\\" Now, let's examine this claim. Frankly, I think it's indicative of the sheer, unmitigated gall these bloated companies have that they can advertise previous releases (the fairly-awful MCA Gold disc, which claimed to use the original master tapes) as using the \\"Original Master Tapes,\\" and then pull a 180 and go \\"Oh, no, wait, we screwed up...THIS is the one you need. $25 please.\\" Chutzpah, eh? And the weird part is that it probably isn't true (the master tapes *were* used for at least one previous issue of the album).<br />But I'm getting ahead of myself. The currently-available Who's Next single disc uses an uneasy combination of remixes from the multitracks (\\"My Wife,\\" for example) and original mixes. Disc one of this set uses the original mixes through and through, and despite the somewhat dubious reputation of some of those behind this set, is actually sounds fairly splendid, with only a few no-noised intros really standing out (and it's safe to say most won't notice them). Is this the best \\"Who's Next\\" has sounded on CD? It's certainly up there with the previous best incarnation.<br />The bonus tracks on disc 1 are mostly extended versions of the bonus trackson the '95 single disc (although, bizarrely, we're missing a few tracks here, like the studio alternate of \\"Too Much of Anything\\"). They're also remixed, and some are still edited (\\"Baby Don't You Do It\\"). Some are entirely new (\\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\"). Still nice.<br />It'd disc two, though, that is *the* selling point of the set: a previously-unavailable Who concert. The producers of the set excised most of the non-Who's Next related material (ostensibly to fit the affair onto a single disc), but it doesn't really hurt the concert. This Young Vic show is essentially the first airing of the WN material in front of a crowd, and in some cases it marks the first and *last* airings of some song (\\"Time is Passing\\"). While the playing is occasionally tentative--vocals are out of tune, etc--it's still utterly enthralling and top notch, and it's been mastered a LOT better than Live at Leeds Deluxe.<br />The verdict? If you're one of the...lesse...five? Five people on earth who somehow does NOT own Who's Next, this package is an excellent introduction; there're certain albums that are rock institutions, pure and simple, and this is one of them. If you're a slightly more seasoned collector, though, the set is still essential, if only for disc 2. The fact that some of the tracks on the single disc reissue are missing is unfortunate, but that's record company politics for ya...hopefully, copies of the '95 single disc will be floating around for cheap now that this is out.
B00008H2LB|5.0|my friend just bought this cd and we both agree that all the songs are awsome. i recommend that u buy this cd. <BR>its GREAT!!
0440213525|2.0|Although I am not an American, I don't believe the thing happening in this novel. Can FBI and the bad guy that silly? John Grisham always make them as silly as possible. Also, why is Reggie willing to do that much to a stranger? given that She only got one dollar. Finally, I hope John Grisham don't use the same plot which has also been used in the Firm and Pelican Brief and
B00008H2LB|5.0|this cd is maybe not as good as hybrid theory, but it does have the same strong vocals from chester and heavy guitars. My favorite song so far is called &quot;faint&quot; track number 07 it totally rocks. This is a must have for all LP FANS!! This cd is so damn good. Its a little different sound thats the only difference between HT.
B00005T7HX|5.0|This is one of my most loved movies. It tackles two important issues. One is \\"first things first\\". Mr Holland had a dream: to write his own symphony. He kept postponing it, in order to deal with the most pressing but small problems of life, that were never ending and in the end his dream drifted away. He gave advice to Rowena, but he did not have the courage to follow this advice himself. The second is the real meaning of success in life. Mr Holland did not become famous as a musician, but he became a great teacher and managed to be a good husband and father. What is more important? I am still not sure, but I tend to believe one should just follow his heart; or at least try.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Once again, Linkin Park has found a winning formula.  They show why they were the best selling cd last year, with this, their sophomore album....Meteora.  Easily one of the most anticipated albums of the year.  And, with that anticipation, comes great success.  L.P. have come through in a big way here.  I just got the cd yesterday, so I really can't point specific tracks to listen to.....but, I just suggest to listen to the whole thing, all the way through.  Over, and over, and over, and over......

0345440927|4.0|This book is brimming with down-to-earth, sensible advice on bringing up a toddler. There's a lot of information on the when, how and why of discipline - often a dodgy area full of inconsistencies when it comes to toddlers! The author really explores this and I found it a great help.<BR>Not sure if I agree with the way the author begins the book with a &quot;Know-Your-Toddler Quiz&quot; in which she effectively categorises (pigeonholes?) toddlers into 5 distinct types, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she can do this because of her vast experience with countless  toddlers during her career. Nevertheless it's a great read and an invaluable reference source for this mummy.

6301247485|1.0|The first thing you need to understand about what I think is this . . . I didn't even think that the book was all that great of a story, but it would overshadow tenfold the [stuff] seen in this adaptation. One thing that bothered me, story aside, is everyone sweats in this movie. Not normal sweat, but lean-your-head-to-the-left-and-be-blinded-sweat. I can understand they were trying to show Eastern humidity in the summer, but this was just gross. Now, about the movie itself, the script writers had to be rather horrible, for rather than illustrating the author's narrator's viewpoints of the other characters, the character who played Nick Carraway had to say extensive dialog right out of the book, it just got irritating. Tom Buchanan might do something, and rather than have the actor portray how he felt with gestures or SOMETHING, and there was was \\"When Tom did that I blablabalabblabblablablablabla . . . . blablablablab\\" So in the end it sets up as a direct out of the book adaption (<- which is a good thing) that used lengthy irritating excrepts from the book to illustrate how people felt and thought.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Sorry, but this is the best movie in the world. Thank goodness it won an Oscar, or else it would have never been released. Crazy how that works out.  Buy it.  Enjoy it.  It will make you a better person.
0385508476|5.0|To make this review short and simple if my title doesn't tell it all ...The diary of anne frank is a great story about a little girl along with others who try and decieve hitler's gestapo/ green police by hiding and in the end are found out taken away where later they all,expect one Anne's father die. From this amazing girl,her diary and her father, Otto we are able to read the story and learn about a girl and others who have a diffcult time surviving World War two as well as each other.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is a dark and extremely graphic true story about the embarrassing and grif-stricken failure of the U.N. intervention that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia in October of 1993. The movie takes place where the soldiers are assigned onto a mission to capture or killed the two generals of a vicious warlord who was ordering militiamen to seize food supplies that were meant to feed the starving and the U.N. and American forces intervened in a vain attempt to overthrow the militiamen and help the poor. The whole intervention plans were poorly planned out though and it would ultimately make the invasion of Somalia a doomed failure to begin with and what was supposed to last up to an hour at the most would become a bloody battle that lasted for over a day in the `hostile territory' of Mogadishu. This ill-fated military intervention in Mogadishu was a hard and cold lesson for America and the Western governments that military superiority and the most advanced gizmos don't always bring victory and America suffered its biggest military loss since The Vietnam War in 1973. This movie perfectly documents the extremely horrific situations that the soldiers had to endure and the extremely hostile atmosphere that they faced off against. The melee went downhill into failure especially when two helicopters crashed after taking enemy fire and the soldiers who were on them were now stranded in the streets of Mogadishu in an area that was patrolled by enemy militiamen and they eventually attacked by the thousands and ultimate 18 American soldiers died in the fiasco. The failure of October 1993 seems to have been forgotten by a vast majority of the American public. This movie, like almost any other war movie, is not for the squeamish. I don't recommend this movie to the squeamish nor the light-stomached either because of some extremely graphic bloody scenes but those who can handle such heavy content, this is one of the best war movies that I've seen. The only flaw to this movie is that not enough time is given to introducing us to the soldiers and lieutenants who took part in the battle. Other than that, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a dark and chilling masterpiece in the war movie genre.not enough time is given to introducing us to the soldiers and lieutenants who took part in the battle. Other than that, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a dark and chilling masterpiece in the war movie genre.
B00005JKDR|5.0|A truly fun and original story and the extras kept me busy for an hour or so.  What a fun DVD.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This Song is the greatest!It has a beat and ,Its a toe taper!You soud make alot more like this,so young people like me will have a better life,when they get older,Because rap is cool and all but............It gives them the wronge idea about fixing there problems! Like the way Emiem talks about his wife,and mother,so make more good cd and make less bad and the world will be a little bit better.Alot better!!
B00008H2LB|3.0|This album is iffy in my opinion. My big complaint is....in 2 years all they can come up with is 37 minutes? that is whack, its about as bad as them coming out with a remix of their debut album after like a year. They just cant let hybrid theory go so they remix it and think that it will satisfy their fans. I have to admit the songs rock on meteora but just so short it brings the whole record down. Dont waste money on this album, just burn it from a friend like I did, no sense in paying so much for this. This record brings one question.....<BR> CAN LINKIN PARK CREATE A CD THAT LASTS LONGER THAN 40 MINUTES? obviously not
B0000029DD|5.0|This is definately one of the best albums of all time.From the haunting melody of &quot;Halleilujah&quot; to the guitar riffs of &quot;Dream Brother&quot; - this album is the work of a musical genius.Even the tracks that I tend to skip over have a piece of Buckley that is unmistakeable......If only he was still here to share more of his music with us.....
B00008H2LE|5.0|I JUST BOUGHT THIS ALBUM AND IT IS THE BEST FROM LINKIN PARK. I LOVED HYBRID THEORY, REANIMATION WASNT THAT GOOD BECAUSE OF ALL THE RAP/ROCK. THIS CD IS THE BEST BY FAR, THE DVD IS ALSO REALLY GOOD I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS CD TO EVERYONE.....L8ER
B000003TAR|5.0|&quot;Nevermind&quot; changed the face of pop music.  But, it wasn't pop music that Cobain and Co. were trying to change.  It was music itself.  And this album performs that feat a thousand times over.  It single-handedly brought back the type of aggression that punk music had in the 70s and sold out in the 80s.  &quot;In Utero&quot; not only brings back that aggression, but it adds a sentimental touch that only Cobain as a songwriter could bring.  It's truly a scary album, and can sometimes be tough to listen to in the dark.  Just scary and powerful enough to change music.  Go buy it.
0066620996|5.0|What an incredibly insightful book!  Throw away speculation and hypothesis and theories.  This book is based on fact gained from honest to goodness research.<br />It is amazing to see how the &quot;great&quot; companies do many things that defy traditional business logic.  This book really got me thinking and, more importantly, growing - both as a business person and leader.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's new CD is absolutely awesome. It's a great improvement over the already superb ReAnimation, and it's FINALLY new music instead of remixes. I hope that they keep up the barrage of great new artistry.
B000089RVX|4.0|I just bought this album today and have listened to the whole thing twice. It has some elements of the nu-metal groups such as the same guitar riffs heard over and over throughout the entire cd, which does get a little old. What makes this album so much better are the memorable melodies and of course Amy Lee's sinister but beautiful voice. My favorite tracks right now are &quot;Tourniquet, Going Under, Haunted, My Immortal, Imaginary, and Whisper.&quot; I like the current hit, &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; but I think most of the other songs on this album are even better. I'm mostly into groups like Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, and old school Metallica, but hearing this album disproves my theory that there is no talent left in all bands today.
B00008H2LE|4.0|A quick review of online reviews showed me one thing, many people believe that LP skipped the curse of the sophomore album. While I agree, I still found the CD a different listen than Hybrid Theory or Reanimation. With riffs that get stuck in your head to the melodic live strings of Breaking the Habit, this album is chalked full of LP distinctive sound. Is it as good as Hybrid Theory, yes and no. Yes it is a different sound, the hard metal hate music has been toned down a little, while the actual melodies and music enhanced. So if your looking for the old LP, you might be slightly dissapointed. This is not the LP that I put in my CD player next to Disturbed, Tool, or Andrew W.K. So if you like the hard metal hate music this album might not be better than Hybrid Theory for you.<BR>        If this was thier first album or the first time you or anyone heard LP, than this album would blow your mind. It is not perfect, but from track 2 (1 is a intro track) to 13, it is a worthy listen. Being only 37 mintues not a single songs gets old before its over. I usually have to restart songs to get enough of them. <BR>        To be less wordy, buy this album, it is a must have. On top of that, if you downloaded it, you should buy it too, cause the enhanced CD and special DVD are definitely worth it, plus you should support your favorite artists.
6305205639|5.0|This is classic Metallica. There is only one thing better than being able to listen to the masters and that is being able to see them. In this concert video they play from the early days up until just before Load and what a show it is. If you are a fan and have never been to a concert, don't feel bad. Just get this video and sit back for a great time. Then after it is over get the phone and find out when the next show is cause you will not want to miss it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|You might be thinking what I mean by \\"maximum evoulution?\\" The obvious answer will be found on tracks 1 and 13 and every track in between. They do what they are anonymous for once again by intertwining the tightest lyrical flow of chesters screaming and mikes rapping with the hardest beats. What makes this album stand out from hybrid theory and reanimation is the combination of the instruments they used before with new instruments like a japanese flute and violins which will run you over like a freight train. If you are into anything musical and I mean anything than I suggest buying this album!!!
B00005QXDD|5.0|This cd contains anything and everything the greatest rock band on earth should. It was humorus, but still rocked my socks off, it's simple, if you want your [ears] blown out, buy this cd, quite possibly the best cd on earth and any other planet for that matter. When they said they were fuled by satan, JB and KG were not fibbin'!! eveyone must obey the D. peace--
B00008H2LE|4.0|I picked this up thinking &quot;Linkin Park can't make a bad album can they?&quot; Meteora isnt that bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it doesnt have the same impact the first album did. The tracks:<BR>1. Intro: What's this? 13 seconds of noise? Skip it.<BR>2. Don't Stay: Guitars, Turntables, nothing new here<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong: Again, nothing really new, sounds like a B-Side they left off the first album. Kinda weak for a first single.<BR>4. Lying From You: More HipHop than rock, but has its moments. Again, nothing really new.<BR>5. Hit the Floor: Rock Song, Lots of screaming. Still sounds like the first album.<BR>6. Easier To Run: WOW!! This is where the album really picks up. A slower song here, but very powerful musically. My fav track on the album.<BR>7. Faint: Lots of turntable in this, works well with the guitars. I like this one.<BR>8. Figure.09: Average LP song, not too bad.<BR>9. Breaking the Habit: Cool Guitars on this one, the live strings are a great touch. Another really great song musically.<BR>10. From the Inside: The 6/8 time signature is really cool here. The musicianship really shines on this track.<BR>11. Nobody's Listening: Normally i hate the rap songs, but this one's not that bad. The Japanese flute background is a very unique touch to the song.<BR>12: Session: An instrumental, but pretty good. Unlike &quot;Cure For the Itch,&quot; the whole band plays on this one.<BR>13. Numb: Pretty good musically, the keyboards add a lot to the song. The instruments fit together well with the vocals and rapping.<br />So in the end, Meteora is a good album, and is was worth the wait. (But will there be a remix album this time?) Unfortunately, you have to get to track six in order to hear the really good stuff.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Let me start by saying I was never a fan of Rage, I really never got into them.  I was however a fan of Cornell's other works, Soundgarden, and Temple of the Dog.  So I thought that I'd give these guys a try since Cochise was a decent song.<br />I was very worried to be honest that I was buying Rage Against the Machine style music since three of the band members are still there, however I was very surprised with what I heard.  Audioslave may be the most solid single rock album I've heard in years.<br />Soundgarden fans should rejoice, I can throw both Superunknown and this CD in my changer and play it on random, and the only difference that I notice is that Audioslave is a bit harder and has more talant with their insturments.<br />Rage Against the Machine fans, if you were a fan of the other guys in the band and just the raw power of the music (which is unchanged from Rage) then get this.  If you were a fan of the bands Rap style then you may want to stray clear of this CD.  <br />The lyrics have gone for Rage's famous statments to the more dark and depressing lyrics of Soundgarden.  The songs must be listened to and several of them can actually leave you think of the meaning which is something I have always liked in my music.<br />I respect what Rage did (though no a fan, musically they were a great band) however folks this is NOT by any means another Rage CD.  I especailly would push this CD on fans of Soundgarden, or just the early 90's style of grunge rock.  These guys would have been just as big if not bigger then Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, or Soundgarden (and I'm a big fan of all three of those bands!) had they come out 12 or so years ago.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I just bought this CD last night and I personaly think it's very good. I'm a big Linkin Park fan and have all 3 of their CD's. Anyone who has their 2nd CD knows that that music was like techno hip-hop rock (I know that sounds kind of weird) but this CD is like the first one. It's awesome rock music. I really like it and that it's DEFINATELY worth the money.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I think that this cd just gets better everytime they reinvent them selves. This album is great. Every song on it puts you in a different mood but makes you wanna just rock out. Hybrid theory was awsome but Meteora is even better. I see LP around for a long time.<BR>Fallon saulters
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm guessing you are wondering what I mean by \\"Maximum Evolution?\\" The obvious answer will be found on tracks 1 and 13.....and every one in between. They do what they are anonymous for with their tight intertwining of chesters screaming and mikes rapping. With their usual instruments and the introduction of the japanese flute and the violens amongst some others they are just improving what is, in my opinion, perfection!!!!! If you are a fan of anything musical and I mean anything than buy this album!!!!!!!
B00006879E|5.0|I was lucky enough to get a copy of this CD, having absolutely no idea who this band was. They blew me away...finally- original music a person would want to listen to! I recived this CD several months ago now and it has not left my player yet, I have not gotten tired of listening to a single track. These songs actually have value, not just common repetition. Buy the CD, because you are missing out until you do.
B00000DC10|5.0|It isnt often that a band of such musically intellegent individuals can predict a future in an ever-changing world of form and function based genres. Refused might not be now but their last ever album will change the way musicians under the rock/punk/anarchy umbrella endevour to make new noise. The Deadly Rhythm of the Production Line alone is a summary of such talent, incorporating a factory feel with the frustration of those who were once oppressed in a dictatorship, and a timing and speed almost 'uncoverable' by any tribute band. Mixing raw aggression and a deep knowladge of sociolgical regime and function, lead screamer Dennis conveys to us the frustration and social disorder in which human history has made errors and cleverly fused it with the destruction of music through the 'pop' industry. Musically ahead of their time but no-one will ever be 'ready' for Refused.
B000089RVX|4.0|Really makes you take notice. When listening to Immortal you feel what shes singing as if something very sad recently happened to you &amp; she is just singing it; putting it into music your every emotion. Ok so that sounds sappy so what it is how it is. Any age can listen to it...not just 20 &amp; below just listen to the words. If you don't like it then my bad I did ;)<BR>It has some great rock beats in it that make you want to get up &amp; just do SOMETHING.
B00008H2LE|4.0|Buy it.  You'll like it because you like LP.  It's quite a bit different from the first.  It's got a lot of string samples and techno beats something not really found on the first.  Could REALLY do without track 9.  Very short is my biggest complaint.  It's not a Hybrid Theory or even Reanimation, but it's LP...
B00008H2LB|5.0|Although a slightly softer album then their massive selling debut, this new entry should please plenty of fans as well as draw in large numbers of new fans. Still the same great and unique style, just on a somewhat softer side, but still plenty of hard hitting tracks.

B000001ELR|5.0|Creatures of the Night was one of the first Kiss records i bought. Before i bought it i've already listened to I love it loud and i just had to have this album. When i first listened to the song COTN i almost fainted, it was the most powerfull drums and the heaviest guitars i've ever heard. I love it loud just makes me wanna pick up a guitar and SMASH it.<BR>War machine is a very dark song ...I still love you is a great song but it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album. COTN is probobley the best Kiss album from the 80:s and the last good album before the band lost it's touch a little bit. You won't be disapointed becuse this album has the heaviest drums and the most powerfull machinegun guitars in the world. If you're going to buy a Kiss album for the first time I strongley suggest that you buy Creatures of the Night.
B000005Z0G|5.0|all in all 2pac was the greatest rapper there ever was.He could write songs about [stuff] and turn around and make \\"keep ya head up\\",now who u know can do dat.He was a great role model even thought most people never understood his lyrics untill his death.2pac was and still is da greatest there ever was.R.I.P 2pac, ur gone but not 4gotten.

0385720920|5.0|Palahniuk is a truly wonderful author. Choke is a different step from Fight Club, really different but at the same time, it has that pasimistic feel to it. It's not hard read, enough to last one about a week though. Palahniuk's writing makes it seem like Victor the main charecter could be sitting across from you at a cofee shop, telling you his story, it'a that realistic and believable, ah i can't type right now, it's 3:35 am and I need to sleep but of course, i won't, anyway it's a good read. A nice present for the weirdo who sits in the back of the class and reads all the time (like me)
B000069HK2|5.0|I bought this disc after downloading a few songs of theirs. When I heard them, I had to go buy it... I was amazed at the vocals, yeah they are a little whiny sometimes, but overall excellent, and Bert has great range. Also, I noticed the sheer EMOTION in the music. The difference in the emotion on this CD and the emotion of FATA is large...Great lyrics, great guitar, great everything. Although the band members aren't the best musicians by themselves, they come together to make incredible music. Everything flows together well. One of my favorite \\"screamo\\" bands; one of my favorite bands overall. It [upsets]me that one would associate The Used with teeny-boppers; just because they are getting attention on the radio and a mainstream music channel does not mean they [are bad]. They are not another band from the Pop-factory, and do not sound much like anything else played on these stations. Maybe this will spark the interest of some listeners who like all that commercial stuff and get them to check out more indie/\\"emo\\" bands... If you are a fan of well-done music and enjoy screaming-singing, you will most likely like this.<BR>Choice tracks: Poetic Tragedy, Greener with the Scenery, Pieces Mended
B00008H2LE|5.0|Meteora is bashed by critics as being the same as the last CD. Linkin Park does sound a lot themselves but that does not diminish the album.<BR>The CD does follow the same formula as the last, but a formula that sells 8 million copes is worth using again.<BR>This CD, like the last is full of great songs that most likely will not be released (my current favorite is &quot;Hit The Floor&quot;). And just to state, there are some songs which break new ground for the band. &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; for example, exhibits a Japanese style flute, that's new. &quot;Breaking The Habit&quot; is a softer song than usual. Like the last,I'm sure that every song will have it's own bunch of fans that claim it the best on the album. This is an excellent album, and it's sound was made to be similiar. So by calling it the same, you award Linkin Park's effort.
B00005JLSE|5.0|...when this DVD is released in August,[i hope it is]in letterbox format, not in pan-and-scan format.  I have seen CHICAGO on the big screen 5 times (so far) and if the DVD screws with the original presentation, and cuts off the sides, I believe I will lose my mind...
B00008H2LE|5.0|In Meteora it is clear that Linkin Park has not lost their touch, which is very comforting because they are one of my favorite bands. Meteora seems to be a little bit harder than Hybrid Theory. With great Lyrics and angry guitar play, Meteora just might be one of the greatest albums of the year. The only downside to Meteora is its length, A WHOPPING 36 MINTUTES!!! but its shortness is looked over and hopefully in LPs next work, will be getting better and better as they progress.
B00005JLO2|5.0|It was a lackluster start that takes you suddenly on an adventure you can't stop watching, a movie you can definetly get into. It isn't for everyone, but if you like to get involved and be part of the experience all you need is some popcorn and- bamm you got a great story. The script and acting are very good, with a good cast and cinemotography as well as some exotic locations. It has drama, romance and action in a nice package, it will definetly fullfill. I loved it.
B00008H2LE|5.0|i have been a linkin park fan for a while now, and i absolutely loved hybrid theroy. I have to say this is EVEN BETTER. i can stop listening to it. i don't even have a favorite song because i can't pick one. My advice to go buy it if you havent already
0790730960|4.0|Worth a second look in sharp contrast to BATMAN AND ROBIN, BATMAN RETURNS with Tim Burton's dark vision. Once again, the film takes on the modern film noir and set designer Anton Furst's Gotham City is one of the major supporting \\"characters\\" in the film.  The unpopular belief that Batman/Keaton was a guest star in his own film playing second fiddle to the villians is not entirely true.  Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne has a lot of screen presence.  Penguin (Danny Devito - picked for the role from entirely public demand) is unrecognisable and was made into a grotesque monster was the only flaw of the film. However, the casting of Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman was a stroke of genious and plays the part brilliantly.  This film noir is enhanced by a twisted \\"menage de trois\\" between the \\"animal\\" characters.  There's a lot of ... heat and tension simmering underneath all the black leather, rubber, and blubber. Batman must prove that there is more to the Penguin than his wanting to be accepted as a human being and public figure running for mayor.  Behind the twisted Penguin is tycoon Max Shreck (Christopher Walken).  At the same time, The Catwoman (Pfeiffer) is bent on destroying all men - human, bat, or penguin, who get in her way. Again, this is one of Tim Burton's dark visionary worlds. An entertaining piece of  filmaking..perhaps a forgotten gem, but the casting, script, and direction need to be looked at again because their is lot to see and absorb. Note: Classic Line- Selina/Catwoman \\"Sickos never scare me..at least they're committed!\\"
B00003CXI1|5.0|I remember when the Harry Potter craze first broke out. I couldn't understand why everyone was going so wild over the books. It wasn't until I watched \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" that I became a Harry Potter fan. After watching this fun and whimsical movie, I immediately went out and bought the books. I fell in love with the books just as much as I loved the movie! It made me realize that you don't have to be a child to love this series.<br />I loved everything about this movie, especially the casting. I don't think the characters could have been cast any better. Even though the movie is close to three hours long, it doesn't feel like it because you truly get caught up in the story and the characters.<br />Anyone who wants to watch a film full of fantasy and fun, watch this movie! You will not be disappointed!!!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I admit, when I first heard Linkin Park's first album, Hybrid Theory, I wasn't too impressed.  After listening to the album a second time, I loved them.  Reanimation was the same way, as well as this album.  DO NOT expect this album to be the same style as Reanimation, as Reanimation was a remix cd of Hybrid Theory.  The style is classic Linkin Park all the way.  Some great vocals, enhanced sounds, and some excellent drum playing make this cd their best yet.  If you like Rap/metal/rock, at least give this cd a try.  Don't buy the version with the dvd unless you really want to see how they made this cd (which is actually kinda interesting) as this cd has the same stuff except the dvd.<br />BTW: Contrary to their previous cd's, this one has the lyrics included :)
B00008BXJF|4.0|Praise: King Crimson continue to make quality progressive rock music after 30 years. There are some memorable tracks here like: Eyes Wide Open, Facts Of Life and Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With. The instrumental tracks like Level Five, Elektrik and Dangerous Curves are well conceived and executed.<br />Criticism: The band attempt nothing new or original. This is pretty similar to The Construkction Of Light and Thrak. Also, although I appreciate the talents of Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn, I miss the originality of Tony Levin and Bill Bruford. Adrian Belew and Robert Fripp appear to be what make The Power To Believe halfway original and inventive. I did not appreciate The Power To Believe being reprised a total of FOUR times! Nor did I appreciate the Facts Of Life Intro. I think the band could have come up with five more full length originals.<br />Conclusion: I think Crimson fans will enjoy this if they're not comparing it to old Crimson. If you like Belew-era Crimson you will enjoy this.
B00008H2LE|5.0|After alot of people heard Hybrid Theory and saw how much of a success it was, im sure they doubted quality in a follow up. They are sure to be disappointed when they hear Meteora. This is an explosive album with lots of energy. Chester and Mike's song writing has progressed. The songs seem to convey emotions and feelings they are experiencing. Overall, this is by far the best follow up since 311's Grassroots.
B00005JLH3|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie \\"Drumline\\"! It's an incredible film centered around a marching band at a university. The music is wonderful and you immediately get caught up in the characters and the out of this world band sequences! One thing that I particularly like about this film is that it's realistic to college life - struggle, striving to succeed, etc. It wasn't like the cliche \\"teen movie\\" that has no plot. This is a truly great movie. I would highly recommend it! No matter what type of music you love, you'll definitely be tapping your feet and nodding your head to the music while watching this film!
B00008H2LB|5.0|How to express on the rock music?<BR>Maybe you say so like this: It has enough sounds to hear, so I can't stand it. But Linkin Park's rock music is more useful to take a good shape than any other exercise. Just listen, and you can feel new experience on their rock world...I've have a good shape after listening to Linkin Park's rock music. Listen to music causes double effect to take a great shape...
B00005JLSE|3.0|I'm so disappointed this film won best picture. It should have gone to The Pianist. \\"Chicago\\" was just okay. I still don't get how so many people thought this film was great. It was alright and that's it. I'll admit I don't care for musicals one bit. They're often shallow and riddled with one musical number after the next, with little plot. \\"Chicago\\" fits the bill. I liked \\"Moulin Rouge\\". It was original and different, but \\"Chicago\\" struck me as a typical, classical, paint-by-the-numbers musical. I also know that when my grandmother informs me that she and my grandfather went to the movie theater to see \\"Chicago\\" twice (and they never see a movie twice, nor go to the movies very often) that it's definitely an old fashioned, paint-by-numbers movie. My girlfriend agreed that \\"Chicago\\" was just a moderately, modestly decent film. I would have preferred something with more depth and meaning like \\"Gangs Of New York\\" or \\"The Pianist\\" to win best picture over such lightweight fare as \\"Chicago\\". Don't get me wrong, Bob Fosse was a talented playwright/director, but this movie didn't do all that much for me.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This is a good album. It measures up to Hypbrid Theory. Some of the songs sound the same and they are too short. But alot of them have some beats and lyrics that stick out in your head. Chester and Mike's song writing ability has progressed alot since Hybrid. The sonds contain more of their feelings and what they are thinking
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I don't think there is one bad thing I could say about the movie \\"E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial\\"! I have loved this movie since I was a child and loved it even more when it was re-released in the theaters and released on DVD.<br />I think this is the perfect movie for children and adults and shows us that friendship can cross any boundary or obstacle. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. It's probably the only movie that can make me cry every single time I see it! Watch this movie! You won't be disappointed!!!!
B00003CXXP|1.0|A good story should have one or more of these: a good story, moral lesson, or emotional content.  Spielberg's AI falls short in all of these.  The story could be interesting but is not told well.  You feel some sympathy for the character but it is more pity than understanding.  If it's showing somewhere on TV for free it's worth a look, but it's very long and doesn't keep one's interest enough to watch it till the end.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Didn't really seem all that special to me, sounded like all other jazz CDs, don't understand why she got so many grammies while other artists were ignored.  Very disappointed, I'd recommend borrowing the CD before purchasing it.
B00005JLWN|1.0|Once again, I see a poor movie, and then come on Amazon to see scores of people who have writeen a briliant review of it. This is undeniably a rip off of the Matrix, an obvious cash in on a cult movie, but then again, I guess it was only a matter of time before that happened.<br />Now I was actually hoping to be pleasantly surpirsed by Equilibrium, as the storyline seemed to be a very promising one. Set in the future in the aftermath of World War 3, a drug is given to people to keep their emotions stable, with the thought being that it is emotions that account for wars beginning in the first place, thus eliminating them would rid the world of war altogether. But one person forgets to take the drug, and so it goes... <br />But it seems the storyline is only good thing about this film, as it drags on to become a total bore. It's main weakness being the action sequences, good on effects, but completely ridiculous on realisation, as we see one man wipe out a gang of twenty or so other men time and time again. The scenes are corny, and I found myself laughing at the stupidity of them countless times.<br />There were only about ten people in the whole cinema when I went (which figures) including my friends, and even they, who had been eagerly awaiting it admitted afterwards that it was bad to the point of being laughable, so I honestly don't know where all these good reviews have been coming from. Then again. there were a few morons in the audience who seemed to be enjoying it, so I suppose they could have come from them . <br />I'm not saying this a truly, truly, awful movie. As I've written in my title, it is the worst movie I have seen this year. I'm sure there have been worse ones than this, but I wouldn't know because I only try to watch quality movies. But compared to the rest I have seen this year, this is definitely the worst.
B00008DDXC|4.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is a good sequel to \\"Harry Potters and the Socerer's Stone\\". Much like the first movie, \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" is full of magic and fantasy. However, this film is much scarier than the first, something the surprised me a little. Even though I read the books, I was a little surprised by how graphic and violent some of the fight scenes were.<br />Even though some of the scenes may have been a little too much for younger children, I would still recommend watching this film. I doubt there is a Harry Potter fan out there who hasn't, but those of you who aren't, this is a film to at least check out.
B00008H2LE|4.0|This is a really good cd. I think that this is better than Hybrid Theory. I hear new stuff in this like for example the song \\"Breaking the Habbit\\". All through out the song, it has 'live' rythm of violinist and cello-ist. The song \\"Fait\\" made me remember \\"The Jetsons\\" for some weird reason.. he! And finally, the song \\"Nobody's Listening\\" has a really Japanese sound... I like the song. THANX!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|I personally had never heard of this band until just recently I heard &quot;Bring me to life&quot; on MTV and I instanly fell in love with it. I went and bought the cd and it was better then I expected. This band, Evanescence deserves to be compared to bands such as Linkin Park. They are that good. Songs like &quot;My Immortal&quot;, &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;Taking Over Me&quot; are just a few of the highlights of this cd. I would recommend this cd to anyone that is a fan of Linkin Park.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin Park has been around for a year or so. There first album was an international best seller. Then they put out a remix which involved a lot of rap mixed rock. Now they have put a new album out and it is a trip back to the original sound. The hevy guatir mixed with the hevy sounds of chester brings the album to life. The highly anticipated CD of linkin park is a must buy for all fans. All I have left to say is with this new album out then what could possibly be next for the band.
B00003CXSM|4.0|&quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; is a cute film that centers around the life of Mary, a wedding planner. It's no doubt that Mary can plan an incredible wedding; however, she seems to be unable to her own Prince Charming. Then she finds him. The only problem is, he is the groom in a huge and important wedding she's planning.<br />This is a feel-good movie that makes you believe that you can find love anywhere. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey did great jobs in their roles, and had great chemistry together.<br />If you want to feel all &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; inside, watch this film. It'll definitely bring a smile to your face!
B00003CXBK|3.0|The plot can be summed up in two words: Incoherent eco-babble.  Oh yeah, and we shouldn't nurture hate in our hearts.  Other than that, the animation was very good but, with the exception of a few landscape scenes, not what I would call stunning.  My 9-year old daughter enjoyed it more than I did, but my 12-year old was instantly weirded out by it.  That said, once you get past the silly non-plot, it wasn't a bad movie, just not as good as most of the reviews here would have you believe.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is a good cd. Go Buy it . This their best one out
B0000017CA|5.0|Every once in a while, I will bother to listen to the radio.  When I force myself to do this, I am quickly reminded of why I rarely do:  horrible mainstream metal bands.  It seems as though all they sing about is how bad their lives are.  Acid Bath manages to express their sentiments through, dare I say, poetic lyrics.  The result is a truly disturbing album.  Although Acid Bath manages to achieve what many metal bands can only make shoddy attempts at, they further distance themselves from the crowd by adding Cajun flavor to their music.  This influence is exhibited both lyrically (Jezebel) and musically (Bones of Baby Dolls).  I think the common description of the music is &quot;sludgy,&quot; which makes perfect sense.  Many of the songs begin with a slow first minute or two, then quickly speed-up.  All in all, When the Kite String Pops is a splendid metal album.  I suggest that if you are a metal fan but are looking for something slightly different from what you already have, go with Acid Bath.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I've always been hearing good things about this movie! Ever since it had originally been released in America. I never had really taken what I heard seriously, because I'm always suggested different kinds of anime, I've been collecting anime for over 3 years now... in my collection I have titles including: Martian Successor Nadesico, Evangelion, Robotech, Escaflowne, Lupin the 3rd stuff, Tenchi, DBZ (eh!) etc. It wasn't until the other day I had purchased this movie! This is seriously one of the best movies you will find under the anime name! It's too hard to explain, I'm just saying that this is seriously GOOD! The only other person who could possibly beat this movie is Hayao Miyazaki!
B00008H2LB|3.0|Impressive but ultimately border lining on Average.<br />Those of you who are waiting for my bottom-line, here it is: This album is a harder-hitting, less melodic and less savvy version of 'Hybrid Theory'.<br />Even their motif (do I sense branding?) whereby graffiti, spray-paint stencils and appropriately used punctuation ultimately relates to coolness (in that conformist rebel sort of way) is the same concept cultivated by 'Hybrid Theory'. However, it is quite obvious that more money was put into crafting this album - more and better photo-finishes, larger graffiti, useful(or just cool-looking) face masks to use while 'vandalizing' a specially built-or-chosen location and (the expected) new-credited band member. <br />Yes, LP is trying hard to be sophisticated. Don't believe me? Put 'Hybrid Theory' and 'Meteora' side by side and tell me you can't just see pseudo-sophistication spilling out of the latter.<br />When Linkin Park first released 'Hybrid Theory', they set a bittersweet standard for the Nu-Metal underground. Amidst Chester's screams, Mike's rapping and the Linkin-ensemble was a certain irony and alternative-pop-rock undercurrent that broke them into the mainstream.<br />With this album, the band is obviously trying to supercede their former effort or at least replicate - unsuccessfully on both instances. It fails to deliver mainstream pop-metal tunes the way 'Hybrid' did AND It still remains too pop-sounding for a true underground nu-metal junkie to appreciate. It lies somewhere in-between, failing to reach both.<br />Many hardcore LP fans will still love this album, but not as much as the first.  It may have been wiser for them to wait a year or two longer.
B00003CXA3|5.0|Voted as one of the top 10 films of all time, this DVD does not disappoint.  Plenty of extra features, including some interesting film that did not make it into the final version, plus the great flick make this a must buy for serious film buffs.  <br />Hackman is perfect in the role, yet interestingly, according to the documentary, really struggled with some of the raw toughness that makes his performance so wonderful.  Scheider is the perfect partner and Fernando Rey plays an excellent Frenchman.

B00008H2LB|5.0|This is the album for hardcore Linkin Park fans. If Hybrid Theory never left your CD player and all you did was whistle Linkin Park, then you need this CD. Their sound DOES NOT CHANGE at all. It is &quot;classic&quot; Linkin Park (even though the band is only like 4 years old). If you like a band's sound to change and evolve, then you will most likely not like this CD. Linkin Park's sound does not evolve, they just play some great &quot;earspank.&quot; This is the CD all Linkin Park fans should OWN, not BURN. Support your band! Buy it!
B00006F7XJ|1.0|IT is a good album, excuse me cd, but not as moonmadness or i can see your house from here or mirage.If you want to hear something good get Kayaks Merlin the new one.
B00008H2LB|4.0|So I bought the album the day it came out and listened to it ten or so times so that I might absorb the whole thing.<br />The album starts off with a throwaway intro track that Mike Shinoda clearly tossed in for effect.  That takes the total number of SONGS to 12, the length of their major label debut.  The whole thing weighs in at 36 minutes long, identical to Hybrid Theory, which is disappointing.  Thankfully, however, LP will come out w/an extended CD sometime in the future (everyone does these days) that has a few extra unreleased tracks on it.<br />Track-by-track, the album sounds relatively similar, musically, to Hybrid Theory.  The band has clearly learned a thing or two since Hybrid, though, because samples and scratching appear more frequently than in Hybrid.  Also, several songs are geared not unlike their Reanimation brethren, with heavier hip-hop beats, techno styling, and Mike flowing along with them as opposed to periodic rapping interlaced Chester's singing.  The guitars remain less changed, though they may have a heavier feel to them.  All of this lends a matured feeling to the album's music, though that's not the only way the band has changed.<br />The real thing to look at is the lyrical content of the album.  Being that the first album was released a bit after the peak of my teenage angst period, I could find a friend in their lyrics.  It seemed that every time I listened to the album, it explained just how I had been feeling better than I'd been able to.  The content was, too me, about rejection or loss and the resultant anger.  This album speaks in a totally different voice, from a stronger narrator who is desperately trying to seperate their indentity from another person's.  It is, in essence, a struggle for independence and a realization of the narrator's identity beyond someone else.  Also, some of the brash rapping from Reanimation finds it's way back into this album, as on &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; (track 11) or &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; (track 4).<br />The album disappointed me in a few ways, namely the lack of REAL musical progression (it's clear Mike got a little bit better at Pro Tools and that's about it).  Several of the songs have predictable yet ridiculous rhyme schemes, as on &quot;Don't Stay&quot; (track 2).  Also, the end of &quot;Nobody's Listening,&quot; which uses a Japanese flute and a great hip-hop beat, has a sample of Mike singing &quot;Comin atcha from every side,&quot; off of H! Vltg3 from Reanimation.  I might also add that Mike's Pro Tools constructed &quot;Session&quot; isn't nearly impressive as the debut albums &quot;instrumental&quot; track, &quot;Cure For The Itch.&quot;<br />Despite its shortcomings, there are diamonds-in-the-rough on this album, namely towards the end - with songs like &quot;Breaking the Habit,&quot; which has a totally different sound to anything we've heard from LP to it, &quot;From The Inside,&quot; which involves a whole lot more signing on Chester's part than we'd previously been exposed to, or &quot;Nobody's Listening,&quot; which adopts an incredibly good beat and uses a Japanese flute for mood, making it one of the most notable songs on the album.<br />My personal favorites are &quot;Don't Stay,&quot; &quot;Lying From You,&quot; &quot;Breaking the Habit,&quot; &quot;From The Inside,&quot; &quot;Nobody's Listening,&quot; and &quot;Numb.&quot;  That's a solid half of the album.<br />The enhanced features are nearly worthless.  There is a 12-minute documentary called &quot;The Art of Meteora,&quot; about creating the art for the CD cover and insert.  I thought, however, that the art in the album insert wasn't very impressive and I wasn't exactly &quot;captivated&quot; by the documentary.<br />A few years ago, Linkin Park was poised to become one of the most popular rock bands in history - and some might argue that it's already happened - and this album may be a push in the right direction, though, to me, it doesn't quite carry the momentum they had going with their two multiplatinum albums, though it should please those not expecting a whole lot new from the group.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Even though it has taken almost over two years for Linkin Park to give us NEW stuff, not just remixes, it was well worth the wait. This CD truly shows the talents of all the members of the band...Listen to Breaking the Habit and Faint...Great songs...This CD shows off the true Linkin Park...Every song on this CD is awesome...Just like Hybrid Theory!!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|I really really love Interpol, Despite all the &quot;hype&quot; around them and all the comparisons to Joy Divison I still think Interpol have their own wonderful and unique sound. They are over-all this year's best rock band. And this is a must have album! They are also a REALLY great live band.
B00008H2LE|4.0|The Long Anticipated album has finaly arrived..If you liked the first album, chances are that you like this one too. In fact I thought I was listening to the same album. I will admit it is a solid album, but there was potential for more. This album has 12 new tracks including a short intro. I am giving this album four stars because flows very nicely and provides the same power their first album did..we will see how long they can drag this one out......
B00008H2LB|4.0|I remember Hybrid Theory and that was great, Reanimation [was not}, and this cd makes up for reanimation.  It is back to being like Hybrid Theory, and not all wierd rap kinda stuff.  I would definitly reccomend this cd to any Linkin Park fan
B000066NW0|4.0|The Good:<BR>I like to start out positive.  Avril's voice is great, she has not perfected it yet, but give her a few years and you will see he shine if the business will let her stay around that long.  Some of her lyrics are great and they hit home like \\"Can't you see you're lying to yourself and you can't see the world through a mirror.\\"  or \\"Sometimes I get so wierd I even freak myself out.\\"  We have all been in those places and can relate.  Good going.  The band is awesome and well out shine Avril on many occasions.<br />The Bad:<BR>Who is the band?  I never see them, for them to make the music what it is they seem to fade into the mists.  Then there is Avril's poser punk statements, like \\"I have paid my dues\\", or \\"I am Skater Punk\\".  Well to make those statements you need to be able to back them up.  Avril does not back them uo as a matter of fact she is not punk at all.  Now do not get me wrond she is the best pop artist that I have seen since Madonna but edgy and punk she is not.  The Clash, The Hives, The Ramones, Cheap Trick, Violent Femmes, and Blue Oyster Cult are punk.  Even Blink-182, Green Day and the White Stripes are closer to punk and Miss Lavigne.   You cannot say \\"You chose her over me you're so LAME\\" and be edgy, nor can you sing songs entitled \\"Sk8r Boi\\" and think you are punk you would have had better success calling it \\"Skater Boy\\" and being done with it and not trying to go for the ultra-cool chat room online jargon that hollywood loves to jump on.  <br />The Lavigne:<BR>She is good, no she is awesome.  If I could add one thing that would be to take the producers by the balls and say \\"NO\\" true punk would not sell out just to seel a record, That is pop and if you are going to be pop stop trying to be egdgy and just crank out the tracks like you did on \\"I'm With You\\" It was heartfelt, it was vocally stunning and it was talent.  It was not punk though, what is was is phenominal pop.  Just be true to yourself and everyone and call it that.  Clothes do not a punk make.  It is attitude and you just do not have it.
B000062XGG|2.0|If you thougtht 3,000 Miles to Graceland is a viloent film then you must not have seen Independence Day, which I can't believe they bother to make this movie. 3000 Miles to Graceland got a R rating, while this movie got a PG-13 rating. Besides violence, this movie scif-fi destruction and there also language in this mvoie, that some how did the MPAA missed? The movie stars Will Smith and Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore. Harvey Fierstein from Mrs. Doubtfire, whom I regonized by his voice in the film. The movie also has a few famous buldings/landmarks. And the three are the White House, The World Trade Center and the Stuate of Liberty. This might make a good film to watch if you love violent movies, or you love the country of USA. But please look at other film instead of this one. The dvd case, says this movie runs 153 mintues, but it clocked at 2 hours and 24 minutes.
0140177396|4.0|This book is a really great book. It teaches respect.  One of the men in this book his name is Lennie.  Lennie is mentally challenged.  He isn't all that challenged because he and do a lot of things and remember a lot of things as well.  Now he has a friend named George.  George helps Lennie throughout the whole book.  George is like a bigger brother to Lennie, but he really isn't.<BR> George and Lennie go around trying to get jobs hoping one day they can make enough money to own their own farm.  They land a job at this one farm.  They become friends with the other men who live and work there. Lennie even though he is challenged he is a very big, strong man.  He gets in a fight with another man there and he crushes his hand.  The way that George helps Lennie in this book I thought was respectful and a good thing. <BR> Its not like George treats Lennie bad and is disrespectful to him, he treats him with respect and when I read this book it taught me a lot about other people like Lennie.  Now I could tell you what happened at the end f this book, but i'm not going to. If you really liked this review and you're really interested you will just have to read \\" Of Mice and men' by John Stienbeck.
0783225857|5.0|Gregory Peck was entirely deserving of the recognition that he got for playing Atticus Finch (including the Oscar for Best Actor), the strongest role in the movie was actually that of Scout (played by Mary Badham).  Badham was nominated for an Academy Award, and I feel that it is on the strength of Scout that this movie was carried.  While Peck may have been the moral backbone of the movie, it is Badham that is the heart of the movie and whom the film truly does revolve around.<br />To Kill a Mockingbird is the film adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same title.  The story deals with racism and morality in a very humanistic way.  When a black man is accused of raping a white woman, Atticus Finch takes the case to defend Tom Robinson (the man accused).  This is a story about race relations as well as community relations and in the end, about doing the right thing.  The house next to the Finch home is the Radley house.  There are stories and rumors and prejudices against the hidden Radley boy, Boo Radley (the screen debut of Robert Duvall).  Somehow, the stories about the Radley home come together with the trial of Tom Robinson and the moment where Scout gently says, \\"hey Boo\\" is truly a beautiful moment.<br />I could probably heap praise on this movie until my fingers can't type anymore, but I am simply going to end by saying this is a movie than anybody who wants to watch a great movie needs to see this.  Both the book and the movie are truly American classics.
0385504209|5.0|I am new to Dan Brown's writing but you can rest assured that I'm going to read everything he's written to date and everything that follows.  The Da Vinci Code is a thrill a minute (thrill a page????) novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The story is straight forward.<br />Robert Langdon, a well known symbologist, receives a urgent and mysterious request late at night while in Paris.  It is the French authorities who ostensibly need his assistance with a murder investigation.  Taken to the museum, he quickly learns that he is a suspect.  Sophie Neveu, a giften cryptologist (and we soon learn the daughter of the murdered man) joins forces with Langdon.  Together they learn of a secret society that dates back to Christ.  Believe me, the story is out-there.<br />The story is filled with interesting characters and places.  I've mentioned this in other reviews, but this book feels like an old 1940's black and white movie.  It would be a great read on a rainy night.<br />Dan Brown also raises interesting ideas about a number of other ancient mysteries.  You'll love this book.
B00007AJGH|3.0|\\"Roger\\" looks terrific after 15 years, sporting THX-certified audio and video that tops all previous versions of the film.<br />Disney spilt the new set into discs titled \\"Family Friendly\\" and \\"Enthusiast.\\" Segregating the extras makes sense -- it worked great on \\"Shrek\\" -- but here the kids get the short end of the schtick. Aside from a fun game and a trio of \\"Roger\\" shorts, there's little worth revisiting in this part of Toontown. Kids are rarely puzzled by widescreen anymore, so for most folks it's an extra $10 or so for a disc they'll rarely play. Here's a pie in the face for that decision -- and minus one star.<br />The \\"family\\" version comes full screen (1.33:1) with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. The adults' DVD unspools \\"Roger\\" in widescreen (1.85:1) enhanced for 16x9 screens, with the welcome addition of DTS sound. Live-action images look a bit flat at times, but the vivid cartoon colors jump off the screen. Audio in either format is front-biased, with the rear speakers used mostly for music accents, not the many sound effects.<br />DVD menus star Bennie the Cab, mixing animation and live action, like the film. They're fun at first, but repeat viewers won't appreciate waiting for the menu gimmicks to play out.<br />Director Robert Zemeckis, producer Frank Marshall and four other \\"Roger\\" veterans provide the feature-length commentary (recycled from the laserdisc), which is loaded with good vibes, great stories and a fair amount of tech talk. (It's nearly impossible to keep track of who's talking most of the time.) The filmmakers clearly love their film and delight at their co-workers' craft (\\"Look at those shadows!\\"). They remain astonished at the performance of then-unknown Bob Hoskins, who conjures up the spirit of Buster Keaton.<br />The fast-moving 36-minute documentary \\"Behind the Ears\\" is new and quite good, with a snazzy parade of images.<br />The DVD set includes a surreal deleted scene in which Hoskins' character is forced to wear a giant pig's head. The clip would pass for a Pink Floyd video.ad. The clip would pass for a Pink Floyd video.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Released in 1973, &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; is Pink Floyd's masterpice album. This psychedelic album features outstanding special effects throughout the album. From screams, voices laughing, clocks striking, coins being put into a slot machine, and various layers of synthesizers, this is a breathtaking album to listen to and somewhat errie as well.  The album consists of slow songs that fade right into each other almost creating a medley.  The hit &quot;Money&quot; was played on FM radio stations and even today still seems to be the most favorite track on this album. But songs such as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Us And Them&quot;, and &quot;Brain Damage&quot; are also excellent craftd songs. This newly remastered SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc)hybrid cd is playable not only on regular cd players, but also on Super Audio players in high resolution stereo as well as in 5.1 surround stereo that plays on SACD compatible dvd players. This new remastered version of &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; has to be heard to be believed as this version surpasses the older version in all respects. The sound is crisp and clear and I also detected certain sounds that were not in the original remastered version. Also, I noticed more bottom end and mid-range than the older version and the output level has also been increased as well. There's also an excellent 30 page booklet included which contains beautiful color photos as well as the lyrics to the songs. This release is a must have for all music lovers young and old. Highly Recommended.
B00005JKJA|5.0|A skinny, ordinary girl from Ontario, probably with dull, fat, ugly, boring, crushing parents, wins a jitterbug contest, the highlight of her short life. Her aunt dies and leaves her a real slice of cash, which she takes to Hollywood to bankroll her, she hopes, into the silver screen bigtime. Although she is skinny and ordinary, she has an outsize imagination, and something inside her struggling to get expressed. Unfortunately, she gets used by a luscious bi-sexual actress femme noire, which sends her reeling. She can't cope with being cut out, falls into a phantastic depression, experiences delusions and hallucinations, hires a hitman, apparently to hit the lost lover, but possibly also to give her a gun, which she shoots herself with. This isn't what I saw the first time round, but what I saw the second time round. The third time round I saw something else which reinforces the idea that the whole thing is enacted in the thin girl's head: this is that the black book picked up by the clumsy hitman in the early part of the movie re-appears on the table in the diner when Diane/Betty hires him --- so is this meeting actually after the accidentally botched hit on Rita/Camilla?<br />This is a very sad story, cunningly told. It self-references Lynch's previous work, notably Blue Velvet (the creeping into someone else's apartment --- like in the Raymond Carver story, the lip-synched singing, the tacky fast food joint, etc); as well as many other films, Sunset Boulevard, Pulp Fiction, Vertigo, Chinatown, Gilda, The Godfather, even The Big Lebowski (the cowboy, the tacky fast food joint), right back to the Andalusian Dog. But the real homage, imvho, is to Bergman's The Silence. The dying lesbian (in Bergman she's got an incestuous thing about her sister), the sexed-up, man-hunting, callous sister, the strange 90% empty theatre (TBL), the masturbation, and especially Silencio! There is no real answer to the way Life is, it's all bleak. The blue box seems to represent the filmindustry. Wasn't there an old British movie called The Magic Box, about the inventor of moving pictures? <br />However, there seems to be another story mixed up in the first one, which only touches it tangentially. Did Betty/Diane also imagine the rough scenes in Adam's house, and the mafia-type control-freaks dictating the casting? And what is the mystical secret of the pink paint in the ice-box? Anyway, it's all very entertaining, very surreal, extremely well acted, brilliantly spliced, keeps you guessing (the first time; the second time you're still guessing, even though you know what's coming), great stuff, Lynch, keep it up.
B000002TPS|5.0|I was never exactly a huge fan of heavy metal, but this album sure changed that!  &quot;I Thought I Knew It All&quot; I think is one of the best songs of all time.  The biggest difference between this album and Megadeth's other albums, is that these songs are catchy.  The guitar riffs are great too!  Marty Friedman outdid himself.
B00008H2LE|4.0|its not as good as hybrid theory was so dont expect alot, the album is onl 38 minutes or so long..but it was very good the majority of the tracks are really hot specially number 9 and 13 i recommend you buy it its still a good album
B000002L9J|5.0|This is an album that is full of dark, mopey songs but manages to be full of humor as well.  The Smiths are one of the most essential album of the eighties.  Although Louder Than Bombs is a great album too I would have to say that this is my favorite because it is not overly long and it is devoid of filler.  The album starts out with the title track which considering the title perfectly fits the move.  The album is then followed with Frankly Mr. Shankly one of the best melodic pop songs of the eighties and has hints of humor in it too such as this line &quot;Frankly Mr. Shankly I didn't know you wrote poetry, oh such bloody awful poetry.&quot;  Other humorous gems on this album include Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others and Vicar In a Tutu.  The real shining light in this album, however, is the absolutely amazing There Is A Light That Never Goes Out.  It is quite an epic, sad song and easily ranks as my favorite Smiths song along with Asleep.  This album proves that Morrissey was a self pitying sap and they were all the better for it.
6305350205|2.0|I love Star Trek. I almost worship it. But after watching Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier in it's entirity I can understand everyone's disgust over this one. It's proves once and for all that William Shatner was not meant to direct movies. No disrespect to Captain Kirk, but man this was pretty hard to swallow. Things that really got to me was the horses on the planet seemed out of place, most of the acting was atrocious, the grand scope and point of \\"God\\" in the film was virtally blasphemy, the pace was slow, the special FX unmentionable and finally everybody in the cast looks so bored and disinterested. Now on to a few of the good points. There was a few cool parts such as when Spock, McCoy and Kirk shoot up a turbolift shaft on a jet pack and McCoy's conversation with Spock's brother. I can't quite think of any thing else. Thank GOD Nick Meyer was back in the director's chair for the outstanding Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. (I can't believe this was originally planned to be the last Star Trek movie featuring the original cast. Pathetic.)
B000089RVX|5.0|I haven't heard such a great album since i was born, perfect blend of goth rock misxd with 2 excellent ballads that can be listened to over and over again without tiring out the album!
B000083C49|5.0|I think I have seen this Star Trek movie more than any of the other ones. Why? Because it's so good! Leonard Nemoy did an outstanding job on this film. The plot about the crew having to find humpback whales in 1986 San Fran and going back in time to retrieve them was very original and really gave the sense of adventure even without the Enterprise at Kirk's command. Star Trek 4 is lighter and more comical than the last 3 movies and it is genuianly funny. Catherine Hick's of 7th Heaven fame stars as the whale biologist while Kirk tries to convince her to trust him and his crew to get the whales to bring back to the 24th century to save humanity from a destructive probe. The music to Star Trek 4 was great and the whole film was perfectly paced. This should entertain not only Trekkies but also people who aren't even fans of the franchise.
B000002L5P|5.0|Back in the day...when MTV showed videos and San Francisco's LIVE 105 played modern rock and hadn't yet sold their syndicated souls to &quot;Loveline&quot; and that infant, Howard Stern...there was music to hear that moved your heart...Quite unusual to hear the lyrical rants of Morrissey in such songs as &quot;This Charming Man&quot; and &quot;Pretty Girls Make Graves,&quot; both excellent songs.  Unusual and very much welcome.<BR>    A song that I feel really doesn't get as much credit as it should on this album is &quot;The Hand That Rocks The Cradle.&quot;  As is so often the case in their music, the lyrics bend around the guitar arrangements of genius Marr on this track.  I'm not quite sure what the meaning of the bloody cleaver is, but the song itself is so beautiful in the story told and the sincerity of Morrissey's voice.<BR>    I never really liked &quot;Hand In Glove&quot; and ususally forward it on this and my other Smiths cd's.   &quot;Suffer Little Children&quot; is a great track that generated interest in this disgusting episode.  I am please that Hindley never had the chance to be set loose on the moors again and passed away in custody.<BR>    Occasionally, a co-worker will hear this cd playing when I'm at work.  Usually it's during &quot;Miserable Lie&quot; when Morrissey's hitting those high notes.  This is followed by a puzzled look and an explanation that what they're hearing is a masterpiece from days past.
0393312836|4.0|...for more than one reason.  I'm sure many people who own this book decided to buy it because of it's 'classic' status.  Those people are missing out on one of the best books I've read.  <br />What you'll find in this classic is a story about the youth of the future, teenagers intent on causing violence and chaos.  Full of characters who live to cause pain and death you can't help but feel a connection to these boys.  Even with their despicable traits they seem to be extreme manifestations of your impulses as a little child, the impulses that made you kick over the sandcastle your brother built, or mess up the hair on your sisters dolls.<br />That is part of the beauty of Mr. Burgess' writing.  If you met Alex and his gang in real life you wouldn't want to be around them, but in the context of the book they are just friends doing what boys do.  Instead of just giving gory details of their actions Mr. Burgess gives us more of a look into the personality of Alex, he gives us more than a violent youth, he gives us a person.  He gives us examples of the slang used by Alex and his buddies, a slang called Nadsat.  It all comes together to create an atmotsphere that really draws you into the book.<br />The book has a good pace, although there are some slow spots at the beginning and middle.  It really deserves 4.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't have fractions...<br />Anybody who enjoys a good book should really pick up this horrorshow (nadsat for great) read.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I have listened to this album about ten times since I bought it and have been very pleased.  I don't think it's quite as good as Hybrid Theory on which every song rules.  This album has probably 8 great songs out of 10.  The album has 13 tracks, but the first is a 10 sec intro blurb, and Tracks 11 and 12 are just hip-hop jam sessions, so there's really only 10 full songs on it.  Still a very solid second effort.  Tracks 2, 6, and 7 are my favorites.  I just wish it was longer.  The whole album is only 36 minutes. What's up with that?
B00008H2LE|5.0|The arrival of Linkin Park's long awaited sophomore album, Meteora, is here at last, with profound and meaningful lyrics and a harder, melodic, more driven sound. The 3rd CD to Linkin Park's repretoire, Meteora is more &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; than &quot;Reanimation&quot;, although with a more evolved sound. Linkin Park successfully integrates all the elements that made &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; a top seller- electronica, hip hop, and rock, in approx. 37 minutes of flawless sound. The incredible dynamics shown in Meteora is amazing- in songs like &quot;Easier to Run&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, and &quot;Numb&quot;, lead singer Chester Bennington finally brings out the full potential of his voice, a soft, penetrating tenor that shatters into a fantastic scream. Emcee Mike Shinoda showcases his urban rap style, with the track &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;, all to the background strain of a Japanese panflute. Linkin Park has soared to new heights with Meteora, creating a marvelous album that caters to all styles and tastes. On the track &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, the band managed to incorporate a string orchestra, creating a new, fresh sound. The first radio single, &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, is catchy- like previous Linkin Park singles. More polished than Hybrid Theroy, Meteora still delivers the signature Linkin Park sound.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|As far as titles go Donnie Darko&quot; is about as unassuming as they get. Go figure then that the movie is one of the more original, thought provoking contributions to cinema in recent memory. <br />What makes this film so engrossing is the effective balance that is achieved between the more technical aspects of the film and the story itself. This balance cannot be overlooked as there have been innumerable movies over the years with interesting ideas but poor execution, as well as the inverse. The Thirteenth Floor and Cameron Crowe's Ope... Vanilla Sky come to mind.<br />Technically, this movie is wonderful. The lighting, the camera work, the pacing, etc all fit the movie perfectly. Also, the use of music is done quite well as it adds to the mood of the picture and does not distract. The script is also a triumph, which is noteworthy given that the film does tend to ebb and flow, 'changing' from 80's teen flick, to horror, to dark comedy, and back again. The casting is spot on as well. Patrick Swayze finally has a career-defining role and Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect in the title role. <br />And then there's the story. At first glance, the plot could come off as a jumble of ideas tossed together, I suppose. But, the way the pieces fit together (and they really do) and the shear originality of it all make it work. Amazingly, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is one of the few modern movies that cannot be directly compared to something else, which is noteworthy in this era of big budget remakes and explosionfests that are supposed to pass as legitimate cinema. Sure, certain aspects of the movie may seem familiar, but whole of the movie is original. <br />If you like movies that require thought, attention, at least a second viewing, and an open mind, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; would get my highest recommendation. And even if you prefer movies that require less work, ignore this and go rent Con Air (again).
B00008H2LE|4.0|I think that this album is very goo, although I still think that Hybrid Theory is thier best album yet.  Sophomore sets are always tough.
B00001PE4D|2.0|As most would know 'Cruel Intentions' is a modern update of Dangerous Liasons, a decent movie that wasn't exactly calling for a remake (although what movie ever is...). As far as I can tell, this movie is about eye candy, promiscuity, and not much else. Any sort of message that may be present is drowned under layers of eyeliner and suggestive dialogue. Not that this is always a bad thing, but a movie generally needs more to stand on. Unfortunately, this movie lacks any sort of depth.<br />Then there's the acting. Ryan Phillippe characteristically brought down the movie from the inside, although he did almost give the hint of acting range in a scene or two, possibly by mistake. Sarah Michelle Gellar did her thing, proving once again that she is by far the most talented actess of our generation who often gives listless performances without a trace of nuance.<BR>By comparison, Reese Witherspoon stole the show by playing the only tolerable character. Of course, this character had the spine of an amoeba. Remind me to never write an essay on my value system. Good times!<br />So why did I give it two stars? Easy. The Counting Crows song 'Colorblind' is on the soundtrack. That's right, half of the rating comes directly from the inclusion of a song on the movie's soundtrack. <br />So to sum things up: infinite monkeys infinite time infinite typewriters works of shakespere blah blah blah..<BR>This movie: 4 monkeys 10 minutes
B00006RIO7|5.0|I saw a local production of Chicago about a month before this movie came out. Had never seen it before, but was hooked. The only song I knew going in was All That Jazz. I bought the Broadway production with Ann Reinking, Bebe Neuwirth &amp; James Naughton and loved it. That's also a great CD. I've not seen this movie but bought the soundtrack and CANNOT WAIT to see the movie. Everyone was FANTASTIC. I was amazed at the talents of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger. I've played this over and over and over. At first, I didn't care for the two rap songs at the end, but know I love them. One of my favorite numbers is I Move On. I love it. I'm a musical theater fanatic and this one rates up with my all time favorites. I'll probably have to by a new CD because I'm sure I'm going to wear this one out!
B0000046KM|5.0|I cannot think of a finer album -- one that more effectively marries impeccable jazz vocals and musicians with just the right string arrangements.  Ms. Horn's intonation and ability to convey such depth and knowing (while still remaining quite understated, yet right on the money)is a true marvel.  Hats off  to Shirley, her boys and Mr. Mandel.  One of the most romantic and gleefully redeeming recordings I've ever heard.  (I especially enjoy her interpretation of Gershwin's &quot;Isn't it a Pity.&quot;)  Pure satisfaction.  Worth a million listens.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from the new LP album. After hybrid theory, with it's unique sound and incredible meshing of mike shinoda's rapping and chester bennington's amazing range, i wondered what they would come up with next. Well, they've done it again. Meteora is an amazing album, which blends incredible rhythms and which are totally different from track to track. LP also comes out screaming, with a much harder sound on several of the tracks. Along with the bonus dvd which documents the making of the album from start to finish, LP delivers again with the fresh, hard rocking, and unique Meteora.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this CD, period. I highly suggest you buy this CD if you like \\"dark rock\\" as the band calls themselves. Its really just hard rock but there just weird. Anyways the vocals from Amy Lee (lead singer and the girl on the cover) are really excelent. She is a very talented singer in my opinion. You dont find many female singers that play rock music today.
0375758992|5.0|Ask me how Zimbabwe smells in the dead of night and how Zambezi mud porridge really tastes. Ask me what chimurenga means. I could tell you but not because I'm from Africa. This book took me there. It's full of secrets and stories and moments bursting with life.  All the stuff that songs are made of... ... hear the song inspired by this book!

B00008LOS1|5.0|No one could be better that the Who and this cd proves it. This cd should be purchased just for Disc 2 where the Who sound just as tight as they did at Leeds.<BR>Who's Next is simply one of the best rock recordings ever. There's really nothing else to say. Good job, boys!
B00008H2LE|4.0|What can be said about Linkin Park that has not been said before? Nothing. Meteora is yet another strong album from LP. The band progresses its aggressive and evocative industrial rock meets hip hop sound further with more sophisticated and mature use of sampling, drum work, and overall production. While parallels can be drawn to Hybrid Theory, Meteora possesses an altogether distinct feel and mood. It is difficult, however, to make a definitive comparison between the two in terms of which is better. Hybrid Theory was so profound and fresh for its time, and while Meteora certainly contains its share of excellent tracks, it is somewhat expected now. <br />The following is a personal breakdown of its tracks:<br />// key //<br />[5//5] - hit-worthy<BR>[4//5] - single-worthy<BR>[3//5] - standout<BR>[2//5] - just taking up space<BR>[1//5] - poor<br />[rk] - rock elements present<BR>[hh] - hip hop elements present<BR>[rp] - rap lyrics present<BR>[hc] - hardcore mood present<BR>[sc] - softcore mood present<br />// tracks //<br />02. Don't Stay [3//5][rk/hh/hc]<BR>03. Somewhere I Belong [5//5][rk/hh/rp/hc/sc] <BR>04. Lying From You [4//5][rk/hh/rp/hc]<BR>05. Hit The Floor [2//5][rk/hh/rp/hc]<BR>06.

Nobody's Listening [2//5][hh/rp/sc]<BR>12. Session [2//5][hh/hc]<BR>13. Numb [4//5][rk/hh/rp/hc]<br />// further commentary //<br />My favorite tracks include &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;[3], &quot;Easier To Run&quot;[6], and &quot;From The Inside&quot;[11]. These are the tracks I feel will get the most attention from this album when the dust settles. While there are no &quot;poor&quot; tracks on this album, I am not a fan of &quot;Hit The Floor&quot;[5] and &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;[11]. I rated the instrumental track, &quot;Session&quot;[12], a [2//5] based on the key and not byquality. In terms of quality, it is an excellent track.<br />I rated Meteora an overall of 4 stars. Compared to the music out there today, this album is definitely worthy of 5 stars, but for Linkin Park it is slightly off the mark. Do not get me wrong, this is an excellent CD, but it is not profoundly brilliant by any means.
0316666343|3.0|The first 2/3 of the book are interesting, fast paced (let's face it, it's a one afternoon read).  The last 1/3 of the book breaks down and falls apart and gets into territory that isn't consistent w/the rest of the book.  And the last 1/3 crams too much and changes the pace of the rest of the book just to wrap up the story.
B00003CXXS|2.0|What a [let down]. This movie not only destroys what was set up before with Jurassic Park and The Lost World but does not even retains the same quality. There is nothing in this pitiful sequel that is up to snuff with the other movies in the series, and the actors themselves look like they are acting at gun point. This has a more strait to video feel than the first two, and judging by the lack of talent involve, it should have gone to video instead of the big screen. <br />I hope they don't make Jurassic Park 4.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago IS All that (Jazz), Razzle(d) and Dazzle(d) me completely, and I have waited YEARS for a movie musical this good, you'd say i had it coming. A cross between West side story the movie and Cabaret the movie, but without the stupid stuff of either one. I am, however, disappointed with Richard Gere, he was the only one not nominated for an Osacar because he usually does much better and a Musical requires a person to sing well, not well enough. I wish he had a better vocal coach. I must say Catherine Zeta Jones's first five seconds made me a Catherine Zeta Jones fan, which i have never been before.I think she would have won best actress if she had been in that category instead of supporting. The second time i saw the movie I became a Renee' Zelwigger fan (I was not as convinced the first time I saw it but she totally grows on you toward the end). And Queen Latifah, what can you say, this role was hers by the time of her introduction. My favorite part of the movie is the reprise of All that Jazz at the end. If you like any kind of music at all, you will find somebody to root for or some song you LOVE in this movie. <BR>In regards to the other review i just read by a 12 yr old... grow up... I'm 18 and it is NOT an age thing (although that sexual element is not appropriate for under 10 or so) the only people who will not like this movie are the people who think opera is what's on broadway and that classic music is those songs that have just come off of the top 20s radio and have yet to move to classic rock ( except for the occasional broadway producer that passed on Chicago the first time or passed on this movie, he might not be so happy he passed on this)
B00008CLOA|5.0|Everybody who knows popular music knows this album, so I'm not going to review the songs or performances. What I'm here to tell you is that if you like the Floyd, you must, right now, get yourself an SACD player and listen to this in Multi Channel. There are a lot of SACD players on the market, mostly Sony or Philips, and most of them play DVDs now too. If you don't have a home theatre receiver and speakers, rig up three stereo receivers and scrounge up 5 speakers. You gotta hear this in surround. <br />Relatively few have heard this release in quad in the 1970s. That was good too, but this is better because quadraphonic records suffered from a lot of problems as far as wear and tear and proper tracking and channel separation. SACD multi channel blows quad out of the water in all respects. <br />This surround mix is absolutely mind boggling. Once you hear it in multi channel, you will NEVER EVER want to hear it in stereo again. It is that good. Let me repeat that: NEVER EVER want to hear it in plain stereo again.<br />Now, you can listen to this in stereo if you must, and you can play it as a regular CD if you must, without an SACD player, but you are just cheating yourself out of sheer sonic bliss if you don't hear this in SACD surround.<br />Did I already say how great this mix is? It is incredible. This new release of DSOTM is the biggest bargain in music I can think of.
0676973779|4.0|This is a must read. An interesting look at society and religion. Well told and worthy of the Booker Prize. The characters are so real, they seem to spring to life. The amount of detail and the calibre of story telling is unbelievable. Do not miss this book.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Giving it a 5 right off the bat may be a little much, but the more I listen to METEORA, the more I know it will be in heavy rotation with my CD's just like Hybrid Theory was. It is obvious how much work went into creating this album, and you can tell that the budget was astronomically higher that the prior album. As always Linkin Park uses a great fusion of sample layering with strong guitar riffs and deep lyrics. Their sound has progressed (which i was anticipating to see how much it would), but they managed to stay true to their fans. Certain elements are much more machine driven (techno beats, industrial samples), and not every song rocks hard like Hybrid, but the songs are all really good. The CD also has a 40 pages booklet with terrific laout and images(if you're into that kind of thing). My favorite thing about the album is the bonus DVD that comes with the Special Edition package. The CD is enhanced with the regular release, which has some great extras on it, but the DVD is masterful in explaining the process of creating METEORA. It's a must have if you're a fan.
B00008H2LB|4.0|One of the most anticpated ablumns of 2003 has finally arrived, Linkin Park's Meteora. The follow up to the highly successful Hybrid Theory( multi platinum ) delivers. The ablumn features improved vocals from Lead singer Chester Bennigton, and deeper ryhmes from MC Mike Shindoa, along with great instramentation by the rest of the band. 13 new songs keep the listener in his or her head phones for the duration. Without any dissapoining tracks the cd flows from one track to another. Featuring the hit &quot;Somewhere I Belong,&quot; with many potential chart toppers such as: &quot;Easier To Run,&quot; &quot;Faint,&quot; &quot;Breaking the Habit, and &quot;Numb.&quot; The band's best work to date, cementing their status in music culture for years to come.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's new album is a great listen, they've mixed two different elements of music, hard and soft using a number of <BR>instruments such as violins, turntables and a number of other classical string instruments to create a harmoneous sound that is new in rock. Faint is one of my favorite tracks. If you are not a linkin park fan , you will be after you listen to this album.
B00005NWM3|2.0|First of all i would like to say that the song \\"How You Remind Me\\", in my opinion (or common sense), is a straight ripoff of the song \\"Completely Miserable\\" from Lit. The intro begins similarly with the only the guitar on and then the 2 part chorus moves incredibly similarly. Just listen to that song - trust me -and you'll realize \\"How You Remind Me\\" is a ripoff of it. When Lit was performing \\"Completely Miserable\\" in concert, after 3/4 through the song they switched to the song \\"How You Remind Me\\" which made me feel kind of bad cuz i think Lit knew they got ripped. OK next, THE FREAKING CD. This CD, boys and girls, is pathetic. Only 3 fully decent songs and you'd have to be crazy to LOVE any of the other tracks because 1. they all sound the same 2. The songs JUST DONT have any special material or just arent that good. \\"How You Remind Me\\" will wear you out or should already have by how much its been played on the radio and then all youre left with is \\"Too Bad\\" and \\"Never Again\\" and what'd you know?....They are radio songs as well.<BR>  Last but not least, i just want to let newcomers to rock know something : This is not real rock. Its bad country-alternative but with higher guitar notes. These guys have nothing special in the 10 tracks. When i saw them in concert at least one of the band members even wore a cowboy-like hat in concert or whatever you call those country hats (im not saying those hats are bad im just trying to prove my point). If you are reading this review you probaby are a newcomer to rock so that'll tell ya something. Go listen to that Silver Side Up cd again and then listen to your country cds. Yeah you, i know you have some country cds! Cuz if you dont and u are a real rock fan then you probably wouldnt be browsing through here cuz its common knowledge in the rock world that this cd \\"is bad\\". Look at the 3 1/2 star reader review. Go type in \\"a search engine\\" \\"nickelback ...\\". Go ask that cool kid at school wearing the Megadeth t-shirt about this album. If you did any of this properly the best response you could get is that this album is \\"ok\\". So look somewhere else!
B00007JVBI|5.0|For those of us who've known about Cat Power for years, this was a highly anticipated album- the first of new material in five years- and it's her most solid work ever.<BR>Each track flows beautifully from one to another, and the lyrics and arrangments (especially the string arrangements by David Campbell, father of Beck) are incredible.  I couldn't stop listening to this album for weeks.<BR>If you're new to Cat Power, check out this record first, and then Moon Pix.  You won't be disappointed.
B00008CLOA|5.0|James Guthrie has done it once again. This is not yet another release of the same-old music; this time it really has been remastered and improved! The sounds are so crisp and clear, the tick-tock of the clocks and the ringing of the tolling bells will send shivers down your spine. Another noticable difference is that the empty spaces really are silent; absolutely no tape hiss is audible in the background. Now, take all this fabulous music and put it through 5.1 channels via SACD and you will experince pure bliss. Close your eyes while listening to On the Run and you will get swept away to a mystical place in the deepest, darkest recess of your mind. You can feel all the emotion Clare Torry put into the vocals on Great Gig in the Sky. And then there are Rick Wright's soothing sounds of Any Colour You Like. Now that's quality music! Additionally, there is a 20 page full colour booklet loaded with photos spanning much of Pink Floyd's history.<br />THIS IS A MUST HAVE DISC, SO GET IT ALREADY.
0719062683|3.0|This is the first introductory book I'd read on literary or cultural theory, and at the time I had very little idea of what \\"theory\\" could mean, although I had a brief exposure to some cultural theory from anthropological readings. The great reviews of this work (and its availability at the library) made it my first choice.    Barry does a good job of concisely explaining the principles, key figures, and key concepts of some popular theoretical perspectives. He also does an excellent job of working examples of applying their insights to literature. Each chapter has a list of 'what  critics do,' a handy step-by-step that would doubtlessly be very useful for anyone needing to apply such theory to a reading with a less than stellar command.    The title, however, is misleading: in my opinion, there is very little about culture, directly, in this book. I would've liked at least some tie to culture, if only in terms of what particular theorists' work means for those concerned with culture, or the concept of culture in general. There was no solid discussion or example of theory in a cultural context.    The second beef I have with the book is its lack of depth in some important areas. First, the reader is left to imagine a purpose or historical context for any given theoretical perspctive. Although we're given a set of rules for application, and a quick introduction to precepts, Barry completely avoids the questions of 'What does this mean?,' whether politically, culturally, or simply in terms of practical use. I frequently found myself wondering why anyone bothered with some of these viewpoints at all. Perhaps, in retrospect, this is a symptom of such theorizing in general, rather than a problem with Barry's book, but I would have liked an introduction that tackled these issues.    Secondly, and I suppose necessarily in an introduction, I found many of the chapters lacking in detail. In the chapter on psychoanalytical criticism, for instance, Barry's discussion of Lacanand Lacanian criticism left me wondering why Lacan did and thought as he did: clearly he wasn't just a literary critic, and clearly he must have had some point and objective outside of simply allowing critics to adopt a particular perspective. There is no inkling of his motivations or historical situation, just a trite guide to applying a few handy precepts to your reading of literature. Obviously a full discussion or understanding of such issues would be a lifetime's work, but even in an introduction I felt more was required.    In summary: this feels like a completely practical (as in: get the paper written, now) guide to theory, which seems to me paradoxical. If you're looking for an introduction focusing on literary criticism, particularly on its step-by-step application to readings, this will prepare you quickly and accurately. If you're interested in anything more than a step-by-step distillation, or anything at all related to culture: so was I. My plan is to keep looking.
B00008H2LB|5.0|They caught my eye when I first saw there single One Step Closer music video, a few years back. Hybrid Theory blew me away, ReAnimation amazed me, and Meteora shows they are not quitting. After the intro-(02) Don't Stay reminds me of One Step Closer, heavy guitars, scratching in backround. Mostly about telling someone to stay away from now on. (03) Somewhere I belong-the first single, (04) Lying From You-about this person lies about them self and now people think that person is really who he lies about. (05) Hit The Floor-Ah...just like a part 2 of Points Of Authority, about someone watching another lying, while they're on top, and he's waiting for them to slip, and fall. (06) Easier To Run-A great harmonic and melodic song, chester sings about how its easier to replace the pain, and to run, and Mike says that he would change, take back all the pain, retrace every wrong move he made if he could. (07) Faint-great rock, reminds me of forgotten.(08) Figure 9-Something you hate attached to you is now a part of you. (09) Breaking the habit-similar to easier to run in chesters part-i mean.A young teens song-he doesnt know why he has to screamo or say what he doesnt mean, but its about breaking that habit.(10) From The inside-A realization that trusting someone is taking so much out of themself, and they'll never trust them again.(11) Nobody's Listening-My personal favorite ever listen to Step Up? This is similar, Mike goes at it with his rhymes, chester brings with chorus saying Nobody's Listening...(12) Session-same as Cure For The Itch-Joseph Hanh's lil interlude with his harmonics, (13) Numb-Overall good song, someones tired of what they want them to be, so they've become to numb. Get this album-well worth it, a lot more emotional.
6300183211|4.0|As a rule, I don't go for movies like this one. Heavy profanity and violence are major turn-offs for me.But SCARFACE is a riveting story in spite of these flaws. We follow the adventures of Tony Montana, a refugee from Cuba with a hefty criminal record, as he arrives in Miami. He's not there long before he evinces a desire to become the city's cocaine czar. He soon attains this goal through murder, intimidation, and resourcefulness. Not surprisingly, he makes the wrong enemies along the way and falls into a trap of his own making...I deducted one star because of: 1-excessive profanity; 2-that gory chainsaw murder scene; and 3-Tony's HORRIBLE hairstyle!My favorite characters were Tony's mother, a decent, hardworking, devoutly Catholic woman who is brokenhearted and infuriated by her son's decline into a sordid lifestyle; Manny, Tony's partner, a blustering braggart who's essentially a buffoon and an airhead; and Gina, Tony's sweet, innocent sister who is inextricably dragged into his dark world.I didn't have to read the credits to know Giorgio Moroder did the music for this movie! The score bears similarities to much of FLASHDANCE'S music.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is my favourite band, I was hooked on their first cd when it came out, and was even more hooked when I heard their Hybrid Theory EP. I have been anticipating this release ever since I heard of Reanimation's release. I even pre-purchased this cd off the officail LP website. When I first heard the cd, it was like listening to Hybrid Theory for the first time again. If I wouldn't have already been a huge fan, this cd would have had me hooked on the first 3 songs. &quot;Foreword&quot; starts the cd off as an introduction to Don't Stay, one of the best songs on the cd. The best songs on the cd are located on the first half, but every song is a hit.<br />One thing I noticed about the cd, is that there are 2 songs that resemble songs from Hybrid Theory. Somewhere I Belong has almost the exact chorus and verse structure as In The End, and Easier To Run is is very similar to Crawling, except that Mike Shinoda has a bigger lyrical part, and Chester assists Mike on his parts. But hey, those 2 songs got nominated for music awards, so why ditch a winning formula?<br />This cd is AWESOME and is a must have for any Linkin Park fan, or even if you like any of LP's singles. I can't wait for what they come out with next
B00008H2LE|5.0|this cd has the greatest compilation that forms these great songs on the cd. i heard it for the first time and right away i loved it. the beat goes really well with the words. the words are also great in their own way. chester does great vocals and mike raps perfeclty with the music. the drums and mixes and scratching of the music sound perfect to my ears. this cd is greta.
B000060P79|5.0|This album Rocks!!! It's better then the first release. sure its mostly the samething but this ones got 2 extra tracks! It has \\"Grow Up\\" from the scooby-doo ST and a Christmas song!!![.] PLUS, thats right PLUS, it has 3 videos, \\"i'm just a kid\\", \\"do Anything\\", and some never before seen footage with \\"i'm just a kid\\" instramental! Its off the heezie fo sheezie!
B00006V9A0|3.0|With all the best of/greatest hits albums coming out in the past few years, Nirvana's really had a chance to be definitive and special.  Just looking at this package gives me all the info I need to make the decision this was a rush job.  There are so many wonderful photos of this band, yet the cover is about as boring as can be.  The liner notes are pretty awful and include a couple of errors..  but as always, the music is what should be judged.  The music here is brilliant.  Nirvana is by far one of my favorite bands.  I haven't followed a band as religiously as I have these guys.  What confuses me is the music included.<br />This isn't a greatest hits album because not all the songs were singles.  (That's what greatest hits albums are.)  Songs like \\"About A Girl\\" [Bleach], \\"Rape Me\\" and \\"Dumb\\" [In Utero], \\"Been A Son,\\" etc, were not singles.   So is this a 'best of?'   NO!  It is missing many key Nirvana tracks.  How can you make a 'best of' without \\"Drain You,\\" \\"Aneurysm,\\" \\"School,\\" or \\"Sappy\\"?  Definitely \\"Been A Son\\" should not be included here in any scenario.<br />This is a good album for beginners.  Sadly, there are those people who don't own these songs yet.  There is hope for you.  But hopefully one day a true single disc representation of their work, with nice artwork and respectable liner notes will appear.  A product that will sum up Nirvana, in words, picture, and sound..  for generations to come along and enjoy and truly understand the impact they made and the ways they have saved rock and roll.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Yeah, well, i normally don't even buy CDs, and i knew for sure that the whole album would be on the Internet anyways, but i got it for cheap, and you always wanna support those good artists. Though I didn't buy Hybrid Theory(but bought Reanimation), i was expecting a lot from this album. The first single, Somewhere I Belong, is good, not my favorite song from LP, and it wasn't even the song that made me buy this CD. I am japanese too, just like Mike(the rapper), and i don't really like his lyrics. They are average at best. Where he shines is in his production skills, he is amazing, as many have found out in Reanimation. Chester(everyone's fav) kills every track he's in; he is fire. Pheonix and Brad are amazing as well. Not the greatest bass/guitar players out there, but they do their part. Rob, though hardly noticeable in some tracks does great as well and i'd say he's a good(great) drummer and has a lot to add to the group. Joe musta been next to Mike the whole time or something, cause he's scratchin in every track. He definitely adds to the group's uniqueness. My favorite tracks have to be \\"Nobody's Listening\\" for the Shakuhachi, \\"Faint\\" for the orchestrated background(or maybe i'm wrong, but the beat is hot), \\"Numb\\" (a very Linkin Park song, but also shows the group's growth as musicians), and \\"Lying From You\\" (beat is hot). ALL THE TRACKS ARE AMAZING. I have NEVER gone through an album and be able to not skip any tracks cause they're boring, or sound too much like the one before. All the songs have great concepts and still tie together very well. My only complaint is length, cause there's only as many songs as on the origional Hybrid Theory(12, not including 13 second intro)(and they say they made close to 100 songs?70? i donno, not a fanboy). Anyways, if you like Linkin Park, buy this album, trust me. Don't download it either.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Great movie, great new stuff!
B00008H2LB|4.0|I enjoyed Linkin Park's 1st album, \\"Hybrid Theory\\" very much. Still, I expected that they would fall victim of the \\"sophomore jinx\\" and put out a second album that would suck. But yesterday, on the day of it's release, I picked up my copy of \\"Meteora\\", and was very impressed. The band hasn't really come very far musically since 2000. I mean, the majority of the songs on here sound just like something you would expect to hear on their first album. Still, there are a couple of songs where the band is trying something really innovative. In fact, I get the feeling the band wanted to do something really different, but decided not to in fear that their album sales would fall. Oh well, I've played the CD through about 4 times in the past 24 hours, and enjoy it very much. I think the creativity and effort put into this album was just as much as they put into \\"Hybrid Theory\\". The only drawback I found, is that the album's entire lenght clocks in somewhere around 37 minutes. Not very long at all, but very enjoyable. If you liked the last one, you'll like this one!!!
B00005LANG|5.0|A great album made better with the additional live and jam tracks.  Hard to believe that this album is now more than 20 years old!  Given that the Marley estate has not really put out<br />much live material, the Exodus tour tracks are welcome to collectors of Bob's live legacy.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Awesome!  If you liked Hybrid Theory this is a great follow up.  You can definitely hear how Linkin Park is evolving and maturing in this next album.  Among the best songs are &quot;Don't Stay&quot;(loud and fast, bangin lyrics) and &quot;Somewhere I Belong.&quot;  In addition to Linkin's usual sound, they have added in some new, different beats, experimenting with some new instruments.  The album closes out with Mr. Hahn doing his thing on Track 12, and the song &quot;Numb&quot; which leaves you speechless.  All in all, very loud, very fast-paced, and totally awesome!  I definitely was not disappointed.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|Strange that one of the VERY first digital records should get remastered.  Dire Straits were very much a band of the early '80s with their definitive blues rock sounds with records Dire Straits, Lover Over gold, Communique, and Making Movies.  With a single stroke, things would never be the same with a record that became synonimous with the changing face of music i.e. the advent of music videos as a medium to sell, promote, and entertain.  Honestly, I find this record to almost be from a different band as the music is that dramatically different.  Only Walk of life, and maybe Money for Nothing, have sounds that are vaguely familiar.  Ride Across the River, So Far Away, and One World are songs from a band headed in a new direction and so was the music industry.....
B00008H2LB|4.0|This cd is dope! A must have for any rap/metal fan.
B00005JM93|4.0|Be urgently warned that this film may make you sick to your stomach by it's extremely wild hand held camera movements and/or by it's intensely graphic physical violence. However, that doesn't mean this film isn't worth seeing!<br />As I entered the cinema the usher warned me, \\"This film contains very violent images and some people find it too disturbing.\\" This is the first time I can remember being so urgently warned. The film begins rather confusingly with a shot of Philippe (Philippe Nohon I) speaking to another man. He was the main character of Gaspar Noe's previous film Seul Contre Tous and here he is playing the same man some time in the future after the end of that movie. However, the short discussion between these two men is irrelevant to the plot of this film's story. The camera then winds down to a club called Rectum where there are ambulances and arguing occurring. Obviously something horrible has taken place. Through the rest of the film we are told the story of what did happen through scenes moving back in time. The intense confusion of the club, with it's just visible characters and camera shots careening almost out of control, slows down over the course of the film. So do not worry that you will be made to feel so horrifically dizzy over the entire film. The very sad tale that follows explains the motivations that drive people to such rash, terrifying actions.<br />Representations of violence have always been hotly debated and this film seems to set itself as one of the supreme examples how violent a film can be with its extremely realistic killing and rape scenes. What's more horrible is that these scenes are so heavily prolonged that they seem to take hours. Because the performances by the main actors Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel are so committed we feel that the dramatic events are that much more real. Leave it to French cinema to push the limits as by historic examples of extreme films it has produced. Another aspect which makes this film markedly French is it's inclusion of the long scene of a man and a woman partly or completely unclothed wandering through their apartment meditating on love and life in between sex. (This recurs often in French cinema. See Le Mepris.)<br />Part of being made to feel so intensely uncomfortable is that your senses are put on alert and your thoughts are mixed with emotion. Only much later, in contemplating your memories of the events are you able to logically consider what you've seen. This film leaves you with lasting impressions which force you to meditate on the nature of violence, love and despair long after watching it. If you watch this film thinking in terms of representation you could make the argument it is homophobic in the way it begins with shots of a dark, seedy, out of control gay club and ends with a shot of a happy and bright heterosexual environment. Nevertheless, with the strong impact this film causes, it does make you to think very seriously about what it shows you. Some people may just not have the stomach for such a BIG attack of the senses.kedly French is it's inclusion of the long scene of a man and a woman partly or completely unclothed wandering through their apartment meditating on love and life in between sex.

B00005JLSE|2.0|This film is well done, but lacks 2 fundamental requirements for a good musical:<BR>fun<BR>good songs<br />...Zeta-Jones is the best thing going for this movie.
6305807086|5.0|I won't say much, suffice it to say that this movie really really stretches the boundaries of reality &amp; makes your brain do a few back-flips before finally settling in and trying to make sense of what is actually going on in this film!  Keep an open mind &amp; marvel at how unattractive Cameron Diaz is portrayed here.  This film is a wonderful introduction into the amazingly out-there writing style of Charlie Kaufman, who reached an even better level with his Oscar nominated film Adaptation last year...<br />definitely give this at least one viewing.. you're probably need more considering it takes a while to understand... but it's well worth it.
B00008H2LB|4.0|linkin park is somewhat of an anomaly in todays music scene. first off, they fit into a terrible genre- the rap-rock hybrid, the supposed lowlife of all musical existance (we can thank good ol fred durst for that one.). But LP shines above this crop, mainly because they can rap and sing about stuff that actually MATTERS in life. Another anomaly: they sell records. I generally fall into the ideology that a band that sells alot of cds only does so because they've sold out and become completely accessible. again, not true- linkin park actually has the talent to back it up. This album is evidence therein.<BR>While not as emotionally tense or poignient as hybrid theory (which is, in my opinion, probably one of the best 10 cds released post-millenium mark), the music is still wonderful. the lyrics still hit in places, and mike shinodas delivery is masterful. this album doesnt tread entirely new territory for lp,  which is unfortunate. 'dont stay' is nearly a carbon copy of 'one step closer', for example... but the new arrangements and experimenting with new instruments, it holds it together fairly well. it's solid throughout, and you get so caught up in it, you hardly realize it runs total under 40 minutes.<BR>meteora is definitely a step up from reanimation, although dont expect quite the caliber of an album that you got with hybrid theory.
B00008H2LE|5.0|They really did a great job with this CD. I just bought it and the songs rock. Its a return to the concept of Hybrid Theory. Trust me don't believe the ... you hear other people say about this CD it great. Its well worth the Money
B000089RVX|5.0|Very good. Worth buying. One of those cds you can ride to and think. The band You're Pretty is better though. If you like this, you'll love them. ...
B00008H2LB|2.0|This really isn't much different from the previous album.......<BR>............it's just that it was time that they should have come up with a new album....so they got this out....since Hybrid Theory sold millions......they made this album sound exactly the same.......it's basically an example of the record industry commercial policy.....u release an album....release a few singles........and then release the same stuff again........ i gave it two stars cuz....well recording an album takes some effort!!And anyway u cudn't hav expected a band like Linkin Park to come up with something new.......if u guys like Linkin Park and Nu Metal try n pick up albums like Believe-Disturbed,13 ways t bleed...-Cold,Around the Fur,White Pony-Deftones n other stuff like Korn,mudvayne etc....rather than spend money on this......and if u hav Hybrid Theory u'v already heard the album.
B00005S6K6|5.0|This movie makes you wonder if destiny truly exists! I recomend everyone that believes in love to watch this movie.
B000003CMB|5.0|There is no way to get to heaven without having listened to this album.<BR>With headphones, in the car, anyway you listen, THIS is proof that there is a GOD. You must FEEL the music here as well as listen and I don't mean volume, the tension and release in Elizabeth Reed and Whipping Post, there is not a note that doesn't belong and embellish. After a few listens you will pray for the next section, the next note; the pieces somehow building higher and higher. It was rumoured that were high during these recordings, again GOD knows how they came together here in ABSOLUTE sync to create a work of art. It is astounding to think about the intricacies involved in the playing and how well this recording captures them. This is a disc that must be savored, bring it out to renew the magic, and marvel at the genius involved. It's all about timing here, the musicians and the world that was. It was magic and they nailed it. The timing may have something to do with the nostalgic feelings, but They DON'T \\"MAKE\\" MUSIC Like this anymore! AMEN
0061053430|4.0|I loved the quotes between the sections.  The ones where other Marines are &quot;telling what they heard&quot;.  You get bits and pieces and everything gets exaggerated and blamed on the Company.  It's funny &quot;because we know better.&quot;  And the descriptions of the APC and dropship are great.  Too bad we don't get to see them more in the movie.
B00008H2LE|4.0|Linkin Park is a great band, together they are a very talented group of young men. They have matured from their first CD but use the same stuff that made them famous. Unlike their first CD, which was full of &quot;B+&quot; songs, this CD has a few &quot;A&quot; songs and a few &quot;C&quot; songs.<BR>Track 1 - Intro - Nothing special<BR>Track 2 - Don't Stay - 2nd best song on CD. Some ol' Linkin Park stuff but more matured with the rock/techno beats.<BR>Track 3 - Somewhere I Belong - C+, same stuff, different lyrics.<br />Track 4 - Lying From You - Best song Linkin Park has ever recoreded, PERIOD. Hard beats but with lyrics that are meant to be soft. You'll love it. A+++<BR>Track 5 - Hit The Floor - I was suprised by the quality of this song. Not normal LP stuff.<BR>Track 6 - Easier To Run - Trying too hard to be &quot;In The End&quot; Not too good. Skip this track.<BR>Track 7 - Faint - Very good song, same format as old LP songs but this one was better written then the others.<BR>Track 8 - Figure.09 - Another good track, you'll replay this one a few times.<BR>Track 9 - Breaking the Habit - Chester's all alone in this song. It's OK i guess, nothing special.<BR>Track 10 - From the Inside - This track along with track 11 try too hard to be cut-offs from their first CD.<BR>Track 11 - Ignore this track, nothing special.<BR>Track 12 - Session - Joe Hahn's all by himself displaying his skills. It's ok but it's not what I bought the CD for.<BR>Track 13 - Numb - Another good song, good writing and producing show how much they have matured.<br />Out of 13 tracks, only 5 are worthy of being hits let alone being enjoyed. If you bought this CD hoping it was the best stuff you'd heard from LP you'll be dissappointed. But the 5 very good songs make up for the lost effort in the rest of the CD. Tracks 2,4, and 7 are likely the only other singles from the CD. Overall I give this CD a B. Buy this CD if you are curious, don't expect the best CD ever but a good one with a few VERY good tracks.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I am a huge Linkin Park fan and this cd did not disappoint. The songs are innovative, but still has everything LP is known for. A couple of my favorite tracks include \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" and \\"Breaking the Habit.\\" Each song is very distinctive and has its own style to it. Linkin Park fans should not be disappointed.<br />The DVD shows the hard work the band put into making this album. It opened my eyes to how much work making an album can be. Those guys are musical geniuses.
B00008H2LB|2.0|36 minutes and 43 seconds, as soon as I pressed play it was over!  I'm rather disappointed in LINKIN PARKS new cd.  The sound is still there but nothing really new or exciting.  REANIMATION was better than METEORA and that was just a remix.   The most disappointing attribute to METEORA is the length, 36 min and 43 sec long.  LINKIN PARK is a great new band, different, but almost 2 years after their debut all they could muster is 13 songs, one was a 10 second intro and  another was an instrumental.  I guess it shows hungry fans will buy anything, I did.  I would think as big as HYBRID THEORY was they would put a little more effort into their second album.  Guess I'll look forward to GODSMACK, hope they just don't throw a quick 13 songs at us.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this is another great CD put out by the boys in Linkin Park. This isn't quite as good as Hybrid Theory(but what is) but it still is a great CD. Don't burn it go out and buy it its worth it. Thanks Mike, Chester, Brad, Phoenix, Rob, and Joe.
B00008H2LB|5.0|After the amazing Hybrid Theory, I was sold on Linkin Park. When their next cd came out, Re-Animation, it was a bit dissapointing that it was just a bunch of remixes, although some of them were well produced and thoughtful remixes, others sounded like they should have been included as a bonus cd in LP's next real album.<br />Well, forget Re-Animation if you didn't like it. Meteora is completely new, and while it retains a lot of Linkin Park's style from Hybrid Theory, I was impressed with how fresh and varied the sound is. The tracks aren't just a bunch of heavy guitar riffs with some singing/screaming. A lot of time and effort went into this release, and it shows.<br />My only complaint is that the album is too short. Only 12 actual songs, and most of them are short themselves.
0395645662|5.0|This book was great.  Those that do not think so just do not know a good book when they read one.  Lowry's imagination is amazing and I thorougly enjoyed reading this book.  It is one of my favorites.  I myself am a twenty-year old college student and had to read this for an adolescent literature class.  I've seen the book in the past but was never attracted to the cover of it, so I did not give it the chance.  However, now that I've read it I've have a new appreciation for it.<br />Jonas lives in a community where everything seems perfect- no violence, illness, unemployment, etc.  Everything has been established so that life is enjoyable and content- yet what it has really created is a world of no emotion and free will.  On the day Jonas becomes twelve, he and all of the other children are to get their assignments that will state what they will become in the future- it will train them for professions.  However, Jonas is not assigned.  Instead he is selected to become the Receiver of Memory and to train with one of the elders of the community.  Only called The Giver, this man gives Jonas knowledge, wisdom, and a vision of Elsewhere- the world in which the community has shut itself off.<br />If you like a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and a desire to find out what happens next, this book is for you.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is probably the best album from start to finish that I've heard in a long time.  The blending of the heavy guitar riffs with a soulful female voice almost brings tears to my eyes.  I can't listen to this album enough.
B00005UKE0|5.0|Although John Lennon was my favorite Beatle, I can not deny that George Harrison was the only Beatle to come close to creating an album on par with what they had done as a group. <br />All Things Must Pass is mostly a backlog of songs George had written during the Beatle days but could not get through because of John and Paul's dictatorship. It was evident on Abbey Road that George had not only caught up with John and Paul on songwriting quality, but he had in some ways surpassed them. &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; were the highlights on that album.<br />Fortunately, George did not hold anything back on All Things Must Pass... recording dozens of songs with an all-star band that included the likes of Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, and some guy by the name of Ringo Starr. All this was passed through the masterful production of Phil Spector who built George's honest music into wonderous walls of sound.<br />One would think that on two 50 minute + discs that there would be some weak songs, but really there are not. One could argue that the instrumental jam sessions at the end of disc two are excessive, but it just adds to that spontaneous and free feeling of the album. George was unchained from his 2-song-per-album jail cell for the first time, so he ran with it. I'm so glad he did.<br />The songs are all heartfelt and sincere. &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;, &quot;Wah Wah&quot;, &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot; are my personal favorites, but there are so many to choose from. I really enjoy the remastered version with the addition of different versions of &quot;Let It Down&quot; and &quot;What Is Life&quot; and the newly added &quot;I Live For You&quot;, which is an awesome song! The new version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was not really necessary, but everything else is great, including the pictures and liner notes.<br />Every Beatles fan should own a copy of All Things Must Pass. If you were a fan of George's Beatle songs, this will be right up your alley. If you weren't a fan of George's songs, this will make you a believer. <br />George Harrison was a great man. He was not afraid to sing about his spirituality and he was not afraid to live it either. Long live the quiet Beatle.
0060977493|5.0|I have read The God of Small Things twice.  The first time, I was merely trying to grasp what the impending doom might be, made explicit from the very beginning of the novel.  My second visit allowed me to take the time to submerge myself into a world that I have missed - Asia - the vividness, the sensuality, and the memory of a child's linguistic universe.<br />Roy's deconstructed plot revolves around Rahel and Estha, two precocious children born into a world where social hierarchies control the destinies of all lives.  Along for the ride is Baby Kochamma, their conniving aunt whose tragic romantic past (or so she sees it) has transformed her into a bitter spinster.  She will play an important role in their downfall.  Their uncle Chacko whose failed intermarriage has exiled him from his beloved daughter, the young Sophie Mol.  Then there is Ammu, the twins' single mother, beautiful, enigmatic, and dangerously defiant of the social customs imposed by Indian society.  Their most beloved friend is Velutha, a servant of the household whose various intellectual and handiwork talent is limited by virtue of his status in the caste system.  The plot primarily encompasses the days leading up to the drowning of Sophie Mol and the discovery of an scandalous secret that destroys various lives.  To tell you anything more would reduce the impact of this novel because this novel isn't really about plot.  It is based on character studies and theme.  <br />Throughout Roy's narrative, you will notice the recurring mention of hierarchies that determine who should be best loved, the values that we impose on a single being's lives by virtue of their birth rights, and the all-encompassing power of love.  From the beginning, the twins, at the age of seven (eight?) are aware that because Sophie Mol is half-white, she is more loved.  It speaks to more than just the caste system in India, or even the post-colonial consequences to native populations.  It explodes the myth that we do not place restrictions on love because we impose it in every society: by class, by economic status, by race, by lineage, when it should not and cannot be pliable to any regulations. Roy's novel is a slow-burning and poetic journey into brutality and passion, and a treaty on the politics that control our personal choices.  <br />A note of Roy's language - she does an excellent job of entering a child's universe, their honesty, and their ability to see things as they are rather than what should be concealed and silenced.  She uses Capital Letters (Love) to emphasise various themes that reminds me a little of Hobbes and his was a political treaty.  Perhaps that was what Roy intended. <br />This novel is not easy.  The time period switches back and forth to the adult and child Rahel.  It has a terrible end but you come away having gained an insight into post-colonial Indian culture, albeit upperclass, and the reward of having lived through the eyes of two marvellous children whose lives will touch and transform you.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkinpark is by far one of the most talented bands on the planet. They have their own DJ and two great lead singers in addition to great instrumentals.<br />On Meteora they picked up right where Hybrid Theory left off. I was fearing they may possible make it sound more like Reanimation which was okay, but it was really just a holdover remix album until Meteora came out.<br />They expand their musical diversity even further on this album. Among some of the things that they do is use a Japanese flute on one of the songs (Nobody's Listening) and they use live strings on Breaking the Habit. These two songs are extremely creative. The first single off the album &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; is a riff of Chester (lead singer) playing acoustic guitar, chopped into four pieces and mixed all around by their DJ, Mr. Hahn.<br />Overall, I would say that this CD is excellent. Most people will probably say it isn't as good as Hybrid Theory, but it's pretty damn close. What a reputation to live up to after selling 14 million records their first time out. The greatest pressure came from within the band and they spent a year and a half making Meteora. It shows in the finished product as they have created another solid album which will push them even further towards establishing themselves as one of the top rock bands in the world.<br />My only real complaint is that the album is only 36 minutes long :)

B0000013GT|5.0|this has got to be the greatest rap cd in my collection. this is one of those cds that you can just press play and not have to skip any songs. and for all you rockers its like pear jam 10. the trance like beats and crazy flows just suck you in and your stuck in the song. and outkast isnt afraid to rap about real world issues. this is most definately not commercial rap, its for the true hip hop listener. and i would recommend this cd to anybody.
B00008H2LE|3.0|I'll be the first to admit that Sophmore Albums are over-hyped. 'Meteora' is no different. When a group as successful as Linkin Park release something the Caliber of 'Hybrid Theory', those are some rather big shoes to fill.<br />Speaking on a very basic level, 'Meteora' does not dissapoint. Newcomers to the Linkin Park Phenomenon (Especially those who enjoy 'Meteora's' first single 'Somewhere I belong') will find this album Enjoyable. Short at just shy of 40 minutes, but enjoyable nonetheless. However, Hardcore fans that cut their teeth on older, seemingly more vicious tracks such as 'Forgotten' and 'Points of Authority' will see this effort as a more mellow undertaking. 'ReAnimation' was a hint that the group was heading in this less guitar and more electronic and sampling direction. This to me was a fatal error. If it ain't broke.. Don't fix it. That's just my take on it.<br />Not to say there isn't some Vintage Linkin Park on the Album; The haunting lyrics and eerie melody of 'Easier to Run' is strangely reminiscent of 'Crawling' on their first Album. Other notables include 'Lying From You', a catchy, guitar-driven cut that makes good use of Sampling and 'Faint', a faster-paced and very unorthodox track that I never would have expected to hear from them. Also, be sure to check out 'From The Inside', a very intelligent, well-writen track set in Three-quarters time. On the negative end, there are some rather uninspired lyrical stylings on 'Breaking The Habit' and 'Nobody's Listening', making it sound like KORN than Linkin Park. It can be overlooked, but some may not forgive the obvious little effort that went into writing some portions of the album.<br />While it's nothing to rave about, but certainly nothing any new or old fan should pass on. Definetly worth a look. Three Stars. No More, No Less Either.

B00008H2LB|4.0|Sure, they may not have the most complex guitar out there and their songs are very structurally similar, but really, Linkin Park's &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was one of the catchiest, most energetic, and innovative cds to come out in quite a while.  I loved their first release, loved the remix album just as much, and have been salivating over this new album.  So, does it live up to their past two records?  Lets go track by track-<br />1. Foreword- a short intro with speeding up percussion (the sound of a cd burner being beaten up) erupting into the sound of shattering glass and launching you into the next track.<BR>2. Don't Stay- An aggressive guitar driven track with some really awesome dj scratching.  Chester Bennington (singer) mixes up the verses with some awesome screaming.<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong- The first single of Meteora sounds like it was constructed from the ground up to be a radio hit in the vein of In The End.  That said, the interesting sampling and really beautiful piano part make this track a very memorable in its own right.<BR>4. Lying From You- Heavy, sample laced guitar riffs and thunderous vocals make this one of the most mammoth tracks on the album<BR>5. Hit The Floor- One of my favorites, Hit The Floor features some spectacular samples, skull crushing riffs and screaming, and some real tricky rapping from Mike Shinoda (emcee).  I love the bridge, and the chorus has the same sort of weirdly catchy syncopation as By Myself (off Hybrid Theory).<BR>6. Easier To Run- Ugh, my least favorite.  Everything about this track smacks of an ill fated attempt to recapture the awesome grandeur off their old single, &quot;Crawling&quot;.  Though the rapping part is alright, Chester's chorus is revoltingly sappy and boring.  Actually, his voice reminds me of Creed in this song (if that's good or bad, you decide).<BR>7. Faint- Fast, furious, slick, and raging, the quick rapping and funky violin samples make this song an instant classic.<BR>8. Figure 9- A straightforward rap-rocker with some clanking sampling and a bridge lifted right off of By Myself, this one is a solid head banger.<BR>9. Breaking The Habit- A really weird sample, featuring Spanish guitar, live orchestra, and -I think- coin chinking sounds from a Mario game plays behind Chester's tortured, magnificent lyrics.  A rather large departure from traditional LP (no rap, for one thing), this song really is quite beautiful, though the chorus could be seen as a little corny.<BR>10. From the Inside- A solid ballad with a furious bridge, I think this song is a better Crawling sequel than Easier to Run.<BR>11. Nobody's Listening- A cool hip-hop track with some unique flute samples, clips of High Voltage (another Linkin Park rap song), and some singing in the chorus.  Though I'm not a big straight rap fan, I like this track quite a bit.<BR>12. Session- An awesome instrumental, this is actually one of my favorites on the cd.  Though its conceptually evocative of Cure for the Itch, the layering of sounds and seriously wicked dj solo make this far better than any of Linkin Park's past instrumentals.<BR>13. Numb- The crowning achievement of the cd, Numb is one of the few tracks on Meteora that not only captures the energy and emotion of Hybrid Theory, it expounds upon it.  A beautiful chorus, splendid piano and keyboard parts, and unforgettable lyrics make this my favorite song on the cd.<br />Overall, this album is musically more advanced and distinguished than Linkin Park's past attempts.  However, it is not as gripping, powerful, or focused as Hybrid Theory or even Reanimation.  Though a number of songs seem attempt to duplicate past successes- Don't Stay and Ones Step Closer, Somewhere I Belong and In The End, Lying From You and With You, Easier to Run and Crawling, Figure 9 and By Myself, Numb and Pushing Me Away- they seldom capture the elements that made Hybrid Theory such an outstanding album.  Nowhere is there the frenetic razor beats of Papercut, the infamous &quot;Shut up!&quot;s of One Step Closer, or the emotional meltdown of A Place for My Head.  Meteora excels in other ways, however.  The tracks are more diverse, from the techno pop of Breaking the Habit to the ingenious hip hop of Nobody's Listening to the grinding elements of Hit the Floor, the songs on the album are on a whole more different from each other than they were on Hybrid Theory.  Newcomers to LP won't be disappointed, but I think long time fans will find them selves yearning for the band's former punch.  In fact, its probable that Meteora will not commercially match Hybrid Theory- though a lot of the tracks are soft and catchy, not as many just scream to be heard again.  Another gripe is that this is one very short cd- though there isn't a lot of filler, you feel like they keep working up to something grand and never quite achieve it (though Numb, the best track, is last, one amazing song tacked on at the end does not make the rest of the cd monumental).  Don't get me wrong, this is a good album and is well deserving of your money, I just think that there is something missing that prevents it from being a 5 star album.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Many movies that promise to \\"keep you guessing on the very end\\" or \\"keep you on the edge of your seat\\" fail to deliver what they advertise. \\"Memento\\" keeps these promises. <br />The story is told through Leonard, a man who is looking for the killer of his wife. Not a very original story - until his condition is revealed, a condition which has robbed him of his short term memory. The man who killed his wife also stole Leonard's memory as well, and his mission is to find the man who did it. As you may well imagine, this task proves to be exceedingly difficult. But as difficult as the task is for him, the task is even more difficult for the viewer, because the sequences are played in reverse - from the ending to the beginning. <br />This \\"backtracking\\" is neither annoying or incredibly complicated; rather, it adds to the suspense because nothing is really as it seems. Guy Pierce does an amazing job of playing the helpless Leonard, while Carrie-Anne Moss (you may know her as Trinity from \\"The Matrix\\") plays her role well as Leonard's twisted informant and lover. Not only that, but there is a powerful message in this movie as to what motivates a man to continue living after he has lost everything. <br />However, the one thing that made \\"Memento\\" stand out the most was, without a doubt, its unique form of storytelling. Most movies give you a question at the beginning and an answer at the end. Memento gives you an answer at the beginning and leaves you asking questions.
B000002TYX|4.0|Anthology 1 was the first two-disk set released along with the Anthology television special, which is also available on VHS and DVD.<br />This collection is really for die-hard Beatle fans, especially those with a historical bent that want to hear the evolution of the band and get a peek into the development process. We experience their growth from school kids in 1958, playing cheap instruments and recording in low budget studios, to the full Beatlemania period up to 1964.<br />The disk kicks off with \\"Free as a Bird,\\" the John Lennon demo track that was turned into a finished song by Paul, George and Ringo. It's not the best song in their catalog, but a nice tribute to John, especially notable for George's slide guitar solo.<br />\\"That'll be the Day\\" is scratchy and of low quality, but this is the germ of Beatles, and amazing that this track and \\"In Spite of all the Danger\\" survived. \\"You'll be Mine\\" has a hilarious spoken word part by John. \\"My Bonnie\\" captures some of that early Hamburg spirit, with the Beatles backing Tony Sheridan. I still get a smile from \\"Besame Mucho\\" and Paul's ridiculous \\"cha-cha-boom.\\"<br />In addition to the early covers are outtakes that show works in progress, like \\"One After 909\\" that didn't make the cut until \\"Let It Be\\" and a very different sounding \\"Love Me Do.\\"<br />Disc 2 features live performances, including some comedy bits. The sound is often obscured by screaming girls. Other tracks are alternate versions of well-known tunes, such as a much speedier \\"And I Love Her\\" and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" with Paul forgetting some lyrics. Another nugget is George singing the all-time fratboy classic \\"Shout\\" and you can just imagine the Cavern Club going wild.<br />I enjoyed hearing the different versions of \\"I'll Be Back\\" with a slower version that falls apart, followed by a more up-tempo version like the final cut. That's the enjoyment of this set, hearing how the Beatles tinkered with the songs, despite all the screwups, until finally producing the classics familiar to us all.<br />If you're a fledgling fan, you might be disappointed, because this is recording with warts and all. But if you want to get a glimpse inside the process, there is much of interest here.ing the classics familiar to us all.<br />If you're a fledgling fan, you might be disappointed, because this is recording with warts and all.

B00008H2LB|3.0|I just got this CD today from here even, and let's take a moment too tell you what \\"Meteora\\" actually is. Meteora is Linkin Park's follow up too Hybrid Theory & Reanimation, and there brand new CD. <br />Now let's just cut too the point, this CD ain't too terrible but it's bad, i mean there are a few good songs (and i use that term fully) like \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", \\"Breaking The Habit\\", and \\"Numb\\", also \\"Session\\" isn't all that bad. But let me say as a Linkin Park fan i was dissapointed, this album just don't have the flair Hybrid Theory did, i mean they did have a hard face too put on, considering Hybrid Theory was a smash hit, and making a follow up too it is gonna be a daunting task indeed.<br />This CD comes with some nice extras, like a \\"Making Of\\" type video, a screen saver, web links, a nice sized booklet with the lyrics and band commentary, as well as some other neat stuff.<br />The Problem is when i was listening too this it felt too much like Reanimation which was terrible, but too say it short, if your a linkin park fanatic and like Reanimation, then go ahead and get this CD, if your a linkin park fan (liked hybrid theory and want more, but not nessisarily a fanatic) then you may wanna save the [the money] and buy somethingelse. And for the newbie too Linkin Park, get Hybrid Theory and that's all.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This CD is awesome. I think it is better than Hybrid Theory. All their songs are great. They are all individualy unique and different. You should definetly check this CD out:)
6305212112|5.0|fried green tomatoes is my personal favorit of all time. i remember seeing it listed in my sky viewing guide and thinking i aint watching that [woman]but one day i was just flicking through the channels and it was on. within a few minutes of viewing it i could not switch it off. the plot is a corker and idgy is my favorit character and what a character she is. she certainly isnt an oppressive character to say the least. its a real strong story about how wonderful true friendship really is and the kitchen food fight at the cafe is hilarious. this film will make you laugh, wish and cry.
B0000062GE|2.0|A student-level band given far too much exposure and hype.  Nothing worthwhile here, just a disc of dull noise and juvenile lyrics. the usual gothic tedium stuck on plastic for the desperate masses of the black and velvet clad.  Don't bother.
B00008H2LE|4.0|I'd give this 4.5 stars but since that's not an option, I decided to give it 4.  I bought this album the day it came out, and been listening to it at least once every day since I got it.  I doubt I'll get sick of it anytime soon.  By no means is it perfect, which is why I was going to give it 4.5 stars instead of 5, but it comes pretty close.  If you don't want to skim and see what I thought of each song, any long time fan of linkin park should get this! The special edition is nice since it comes with a &quot;making of&quot; cd and a booklet in color! *gasp* color! But honestly, it does look pretty nice.<br />Song Index:<BR>&quot;Foreword&quot; - This doesn't really count as a song, it's an intro that's under 20 seconds but it seems to flow into the second song.<br />&quot;Don't Stay&quot; - 4/5, It's a very good way to get you in the mood for the rest of the album (and the intro flows into it...I couldn't tell the difference the first time)<br />&quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; - 4.5/5, The best known song on the album, and it's one of my favorites, though the video is really weird.<br />&quot;Lying From You&quot; - 5/5, This is probably my favorite song. It all seems to flow together so well...<br />&quot;Hit the Floor&quot; - 4/5, Very different style from &quot;lying from you&quot;, the drum playing quite a big role, but nonetheless very good.<br />&quot;Easier to Run&quot; - 3.5/5, I don't like this one as much as the others, it sets a different mood from the other songs.<br />&quot;Faint&quot; - 4/5, I didn't like it the first time listening through it, but it grew on me and now I think it's very good :).  The ending is loud and full of energy, and it flows well into the next song.<br />&quot;Figure.09&quot; - 4.5/5, I've played the chorus over and over again, it's hard to stop once it grows on you.  The title still confuses me though.<br />&quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; - 3/5, The little lyric booklet will say this song has been six years in the making, but forsix years, I don't think the effort really shows.  It's not a bad song, but it's so different from the rest of the album that it feels like it should be separate.<br />&quot;From the Inside&quot; - 4/5, Though it doesn't have rapping in the verses like quite a few of Linkin Park's songs, after &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, it's a refreshing change.  Sometimes I just can't help myself from following along with it.<br />&quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; - 3.5/5, The rapping in the verses returns, and it's good :).  The chorus isn't energetic like it usually is, but it's not bad. <br />&quot;Session&quot; - 3.5/5, I've never really been a big fan of instrumentals, but as far as they go, this one's not terrible.<br />&quot;Numb&quot; - 4.5/5, The little book will say this song came together easily.  This song has a complete &quot;linkin park feel&quot; to it, it's difficult to explain it, but most will probably understand when they hear it.<br />There you have it, 38 minutes (at least its something like that) of Linkin Park goodness! Go and buy Meteora! I promise you, you won't regret it ;).
B00006690G|4.0|This cd is great.........<BR>1.Curtains Up (skit), nice intro goes right into the song \\"White America\\" 4/5.<BR>2.White America, is a cool song and it has lots of emotions in the lyrics, and the way he yells the song 4/5.<BR>3.Business, this song is ok 3/5.<BR>4.Cleaning Out My Closet,a great song to get his sad life off of his chest 5/5.<BR>5.Square Dance, pretty O.K. 3/5.<BR>6.The Kiss (skit), very funny and strongly out of thought 5/5.<BR>7.Soldier, not so great 2/5.<BR>8.Say Goodbye Hollywood, this track is O.K. 3/5. <BR>9.Drips, is extremely good song 5/5.<BR>10.Without Me, a good song, very creative 4/5.<BR>11.Paul Rosenberg (skit),nice skit, but EM tries too hard to make a good skit when there is so much annoying cussing when they are just talking about a gun 4/5.<BR>12.Sing for the Moment,a great song I love this track 5/5.<BR>13.Superman, a funny song the way he just really puts that girl down 5/5.<BR>14.Hailie's Song, this song is O.K.

630438551X|5.0|For those of you who are looking for an equally romantic and exciting film this is the one. Generally people think that Shakesphere is not understandable. <BR> <BR>But the way this movie is interpretated from the Old English, even if you haven't read the play before. You can understand it. YOu dont' have to guess what's going on. ... You see it and understand it.<BR>  <BR>I generally dont' like Leonardo Decapitated...But he did excellent in this roll. He played Romeo so well. Claire Danes is innocent pure and beautiful. She plays Juliet so well. All the charactors are so well casted..<br /> If you are looking for the perfect date movie this is the one. If you are both into Shakesphere this is the perfect adaptation for you....I really suggest it..Rent or buy the movie you won't regret it!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I purchased Linkin Park's first CD \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and loved it so when the new CD came out I had to get it.  If you loved the first CD you will not be disappointed by this new one..  The first time I listened to the new CD I did not hear one song that I did not like.  I would highly recommend this CD.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I have to admit i was not going to buy this cd.  Due to many radio stations wearing out Hybrid Theory the first album, but as i listened to the first single \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" i thought hey ill give it a shot!  Boy was i surprised i am impressed with Linkin Park's second cd.  Every track produces a charge only Linkin Park can produce. Chester and Mike are in flow with mixed powerful yelling and rock rap.  Overall my favorite tracks are \\"Lying From You\\", \\"Hit the Floor\\" and \\"Numb\\".  This is very good and i suggest setting yourself back [money amount]dollars.
B0000009TK|2.0|...this album [isn't good]. What this sounds like is a parody of a parody. I own nearly every song on this CD on vinyl. Much of Zappa's catalog consists of parodies, and they are mostly enjoyable in their original versions. In these versions the instruments sound like toys and the musicians are forced by their dictator to not put any feeling into the music, only parody. The tone of the instruments, and the pace - often speeded up, gives the whole album an artificial sound. Sure, technically they all play very well, but it's theatre, not music. For example, Big Swifty is one of those early experimental sounding pieces that I really love on the Waka Jawaka LP. On this recording it's, well, like I said, a parody. It has no soul, no mystery. It's broken down into it's musical parts with some comedy thrown in and the feeling is lost. That's pretty much it for this CD - sounds like parodies played with toy instruments.    Hey, as a Zappa aficionado since 1968 I can tell you that much of his catalog [isn't good]. This CD and others in a similar vein aren't worth collecting. Try Waka Jawaka, or Sleep Dirt instead.     Mark Pyle
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has never ceased to amaze me... this cd was exactly as awesome as i expected it to be!!  wooooo hhooooo... if you like their other cds (hybrid theory, reanimation) then you HAVE to buy this ... it has a nice mix of rapish lyrics along with the harder sound of their first album.  It just makes an awesome combination.. soo definatly this is a MUST for your cd collection!
B000001EL7|5.0|Without getting long winded, Love gun is simply a fun album.  With anthems like the title track and tommorow &amp; tonight, it easy to understand why this album was so successful.  In these times with war and depressing political messages being thrust at us, Love Gun is a reminder that life is good.
B000002HEM|5.0|This album stands as one of the most impressive MTV Unplugged albums ever recorded.  The unique style and sound of the 10,000 Maniacs was captured beautifully in this concert, preserving an unforgettable legacy by the group which was essentially breaking up at the time this was released.  Anyone who listened to the radio back then has to know and remember Because the Night.  While it is still hard for me to believe this song so wonderfully suited to Natalie Merchant's voice was written by Bruce Springsteen, it served as a most impressive means of introducing Natalie Merchant sans Maniacs to the larger listening audience.  Like many fans, I am not that familiar with the 10,000 Maniacs albums predating In My Tribe, but all of the 14 songs on this album (including four from In My Tribe) are just hauntingly exquisite.  Each song tells a story, often a serious one touching on important social issues, infusing this modernized folk music with a very human folk music consciousness that speaks to both the head and heart in a number of very effective ways.  If the unique sound of 10,000 Maniacs doesn't move you at first, give it a second listen, and I'm sure the power of the music will begin to reveal itself to you.  It is unfortunate that Natalie Merchant left the group, but the magic that was 10,000 Maniacs has been wonderfully preserved in this truly incredible live recording.
B000001EL3|5.0|I mean it, this is the best Kiss album ever.  If you had to look up the definition of Kiss it would say \\"See Destroyer\\".  Look at the track listing, they are all classic Kiss songs.  It plays like a greatest hits package if you ask me.  Today Kiss still plays most of these songs in concert and they have over 30 albums in their catalog.  Bob Ezrin deserves credit for molding Destroyer into the seamless album it is.  Forget about his work on The Elder, and celebrate what he did on this and Revenge.  If I were in Kiss I would'nt use any other producer.  The Beatles didn't and look where they got.  By the way I think it's a total sham that Kiss has been overlooked all these years for the rock and roll hall of fame.  The Clash, Aerosmith, Ac/dc, and Elvis Costello made it in and they haven't is wrong...
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vince Code is one of the better books I have read in some time. Author Brown combines elements of the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, Masons, and of course Leonardo Da Vinci to build a tale of the Holy Grail. The grail isn't what you suspect it would be and the author gives the reader clues as to finding its real identity and location. I recommend it highly!!
B00006GFAB|1.0|I'm a huge KISS fan but I doubt that I will buy this album.  There is no need to buy it, which I know hasn't stopped me before.  But you get to a certain age and realize that there are certain things that just aren't worth the money.  I work hard for my money and I would rather spend [money amount] on a Kiss action figure than on a album that has no new material (Not even a remix or anything).  I can make this cd myself from my Kiss catalog that I already own.  Plus there are many overlooked songs left off this cd.  Here's the track listing: 1. STRUTTER 3.10 (original version from KISS, 1974)<BR>2. DEUCE 3.06 (from KISS, 1974)<BR>3. GOT TO CHOOSE 3.54 (from HOTTER THAN HELL, 1974)<BR>4. HOTTER THAN HELL 3.31 (from HOTTER THAN HELL, 1974)<BR>5. C'MON AND LOVE ME 2.57 (from DRESSED TO KILL, 1974)<BR>6. ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE live 4.01 (radio hit version taken from ALIVE!, 1975)<BR>7. DETROIT ROCK CITY 3.38 (from DESTROYER 1976)<BR>8. SHOUT IT OUT LOUD 2.49 (from DESTROYER 1976)<BR>9. BETH 2.45 (from DESTROYER 1976)<BR>10. I WANT YOU 3.04 (from ROCK AND ROLL OVER, 1976)<BR>11. CALLING DR. LOVE 3.44 (from ROCK AND ROLL OVER, 1976)<BR>12. HARD LUCK WOMAN 3.34 (from ROCK AND ROLL OVER, 1976)<BR>13. I STOLE YOUR LOVE 3.04 (from LOVE GUN, 1977)<BR>14. CHRISTINE SIXTEEN 3.14 (from LOVE GUN, 1977)<BR>15. LOVE GUN 3.18 (from LOVE GUN, 1977)<BR>16. NEW YORK GROOVE 3.03 (from ACE FREHLEY, 1978)<BR>17. I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU 4.30 (from DYNASTY, 1979)<BR>18. I LOVE IT LOUD 4.15 (from CREATURES OF THE NIGHT, 1982)<BR>19. LICK IT UP 3.56 (from LICK IT UP, 1983)<BR>20. FOREVER 3.52 (from HOT IN THE SHADE, 1989)<BR>21. GOD GAVE ROCK 'N' ROLL TO YOU II 5.18 (from REVENGE 1992)<BR>What's missing?  Heavens on fire, Cold Gin, Parasite, She, God of Thunder, Do you love me, Shock Me, Tears are falling, Reason to live, & Psycho Circus just to name a few.  KISS obviously had little or no input in this collection which had me reflect their Greatest Hits to date:<br /> 1978-Double Platinum (Had remixes of Firehouse, Dr.Love,  Detroit, Rock city, She, Black Diamond, and they re-recorded Strutter)  <BR> 1982-Killers (Overseas Only) (Had 4 new songs and shortened a couple of songs)  <BR> 1988-Smashes, Thrashes, & Hits (Had 2 new songs and remixes of DRC, I love it loud, Love Gun, Deuce, Shout it out loud, and Eric Carr performing Beth)  <BR> 1996-You wanted the best, You got the best (Best of live had 4 unreleased live tracks and interview with Jay Leno)  <BR> 1997-Greatest Kiss (Had Live version of Shout it out loud from Tiger Stadium, the opening night of the Reunion Tour)  <br />That's not even counting The Box Set, Chikara, The Alive albums, or Unplugged which had previously released songs on them.  This album is not necessary and I believe is just a record company creation to cash in on KISS.  But KISS is not guilt free either as they are promoting this too, since they do receive royalties on sales of this CD.
B000069CWE|5.0|I've seen many one star reviews on Reanimation because it was \\"different\\" from Hybrid Theory, that LP stripped Hybrid from its \\"rockness\\" and heavy riffs, that the whole hip hop scene was negatively overpowering, and by utilizing machines, it took all the musicianship away.<br />I personally thought Reanimation was a stellar album. It had a totally different sound from Hybrid's rock feel incorporated with hip hop beats and Joe's scratching and mixing.  I am guessing that listeners who didn't enjoy Reanimation were under the perception that it'd be another rock album like Hybrid. But they failed to see that Reanimation was a REMIX, and perhaps LP wasn't going for the whole rock approach but in fact exploring and experimenting with hip hop and electronic elements.<br />Reanimation was different--full of diversity with guests such as alt/rock Aaron Lewis and various UNDERGROUND (not mainstream!!!) hip hop artists. LP was able to take an original song, totally rearrange it, and transform it into something new, bold, and daring, yet still stay true to its original.<br />By incorporating technology, the music was full of surprises.  Listeners may think, \\"Wow, I never knew __(song goes here)__ could sound like this!\\" P5HNG ME A*WY literally sent chills up my spine. I loved H! VLTG3's underground feel.  WTH>YOU is the epitome of the word \\"awesome.\\" MY<DSMBR was a mellow, relaxing contrast to the more fast paced songs. BY_MYSLF had a crisp, dark sound. KRWLNG  was a beautiful, emotionally evoking song (another bone chiller).<br />All in all, Reanimation proved that LP isn't just another rock band barraging the radio.  They're diverse, original, creative.  Hybrid Theory is great because it's different from most of the rock bands barraging the radio.  Reanimation is great because it's different from Hybrid Theory (and maybe even a bit better, but shhh! don't tell the Hybrid Theory's avid zealots that).<br />If you don't like Reanimation at first, just keep listening to it!  Itsounds better each time you listen to it!
B000001ELL|5.0|Why is it believed that a band is only relevant if it sticks to the same formula?  Ac/dc does the same music over and over again and I stopped buying their albums.  Do I dislike Ac/dc? No, Ac/dc rocks but how many times are they going to rewrite the same songs?  That brings me to Dynasty, Kiss' return album(In the 70's if you didn't put out an album a year you were dead. These days it takes years.)after 2 years. The last album being Love Gun.  But actually they had lots of releases after Love gun and before Dynasty.  They were: Alive 2, Double Platinum, &amp; the solo albums.  I count 6 records in 2 years.  Some time off!  Anyway, Dynasty is a strong Kiss album showing deversity lacking in other bands material.  Some would criticize Kiss for selling out and hopping on the Disco band wagon.  So what if they did?  I was made for loving you is a classic to this day (Even Homer Simpson loves the song!).  Sure it didn't sound like any other Kiss album but that's what makes it so special.  I can't name a song on it I don't like.  This is without a doubt, an essental Kiss album.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love Slipknot and Mudvayne. I heard a couple songs and I went out and bought the CD cause they rocked. Then I played some for my friends and they changed they're mind's about what they said earlier about Linkin Park. The only song they heard was In The End, and only the lyric \\"I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go. for all this there's only one thing you should know\\". The softest line in the whole album. They heard the rest of the song and the album and they are now extreme Linkin Park fans like me. Can't wait till I get Meteora. (And my friends as well). And I think, actually that Slipknot and Mudvayne are a lot like Linkin Park. If you like Hybrid Theory, you will also like Meteora, Slipknot's Self-Titled Debut and Iowa, Mudvayne's L.D 50 and finally Mudvaynes \\"The End Of All Things To Come\\".
B00007BH3Y|5.0|While I don't count myself an expert in regard to the Minimalist school, if one can call it that, I've had enough exposure to it to have become accustomed to what most people hear as endless repetition. For most this makes minimalism very dull, but for me the emotional content of the music of composers such as Steve Reich, John Adams, and, of course, Philip Glass arcs above the repetition and has a more subtle but perhaps even more powerful impact than does the emotion of the music of Beethoven and Mozart, for example. <br />Philip Glass is one of the leading composers working in the minimalist idiom. He has scored a number of films, most of them art films (with some exceptions like Candyman). The vast majority of his compositions take patience that most don't have; the subtlety of his music tends to escape one if one isn't focused entirely on the music's flow. The score to The Hours is different. It is still repetitive in its way and it has all the hallmarks of Glass' style, most notably the arpeggiated &quot;melodic&quot; lines and a dark, brooding stone. However, there is more variety in this score than in most of Glass' other music, and this makes it much more easily accesible than, say, Einstein on the Beach. The conciseness of each small vignette makes this album easy to listen to, and the treatment of the piano lines make the music ache with beauty. <br />I highly recommend this soundtrack as an opening to Glass' work and as an emotional experience. It may take some patience that other forms of classical music don't, but if you can fit yourself inside the repetition it is one of the most rewarding albums you'll ever listen to.
0425170349|1.0|What Rainbow Six amounts to is a 900 page sermon on the widespread and rampant leftist terrorism that plagues the world today. Never mind that it's right wing extremists such as Bin Ladin and Saddam Hussein that have given the world so much trouble since the collapse of communism. <br />If the preaching isn't bad enough, consider the barrage of two dimensional characters. The heros have no personality whatsoever. They are basically automatons going around killing the equally shallow bad guys. Clancy might know that even soldiers have feelings and individuality, had he not been a draft dodger himself.<br />Clancy is an author I would compare to Arthur C. Clarke, in that both are fully competant with the technical side of what they write, but seem to be incapable of expressing any real emotion in their work. With Clancy the world is just a black and white place where communists still hide under the beds of all God-fearing people and governments do no wrong.
0345446798|5.0|I must say that I bought this book on the strength of the title alone, hoping it would shed some light on Sir Sean Connery's views on renting houses.  Unfortunately (or so I first thought) I was quite wrong; it's actually about being on the other end of a leash.  I confess that I hadn't tried this approach before, but now I have, there is nothing to stop me recommending it to others, provided both parties are happy.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I thought this movie was outstandingly done. It had a great directer (W.S. Anderson) and great actors (Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodruiguez, and more). The crew worked very hard on the set and i'd have to say they did a fantastic job with the low budget that they had. The underground facility was magnificant and done all very well. The zombie make-up creator was brilliant and made the other zombie movies look like 80's movies (no offense). The suspenseful parts really made me jump, like when you think the people are really survivors, you put your arm around them and get a chunk clean right out of you. The first zombie really freaked me out, she was really well done and played a good, fairly short part, LOL, credit to the make-up artist. While watching the movie I came across the first undead scene and heard some really great Manson. Manson's scores were really well done and went along with the movie really well. Like the undead scene I was talking about, the SWAT team scene when they first enter, and even the childish waltzing music of when they find the Red Queen. Overall this movie is my favorite movie of all time, cant wait till the sequal. I own it on DVD and love the extra features (zombie make-up tests, commentary by actors and director, the making of Resident Evil, scene selection, etc.) If you have not seen this movie, rent it now, you will not be dissapointed. The other reviews sound pretty dissapointing, but it isnt as bad as they say it is. It is deffinitly a saturday night classic, haha. Credit to a wonderful Director, Outstanding crew, and Amazing actors, GOOD JOB ALL!
B00008H2LE|4.0|I think that the new linkin park album is a very good album to listen too. I think that this album is better then there hybrid theory album. The way linkin park express themselves in hybrid theory doesn't compare to this album.
B00008H2LB|5.0|the whole cd is awesome.  better than either of the first two.  definetly worth a buy
0694003611|5.0|i do not have a child but i am a \\"best bud\\" to the most wonderful liitle girl. i know, i know...we all think that...but i am blessed to hang out with her. we read this book every night i watch her (at least twenty times before she nods off) and each time we get to \\"the old lady whispering hush\\" she puts her finger to my mouth and i put mine to hers and we both whisper \\"hush.\\" <BR>i am not sure i completely knew the meaning of love before i started hanging out with my friend. happy birthday isabela...you are two. it is late, my friend...hush.<BR>always,<BR>best bud
B000089RVX|5.0|i don't know which exact words im going to use to describe evanescence's music...but one thing for sure, its amazing! its rare that you can find a good rock band with a female vocalist.. but amy lee did a very good job on vocals, her haunting voice seems to fit on every song whether its more of rock or just plain ballad. some standouts are Going Under, Tourniquet, Taking Over Me, Everybody's Fool and of course the two hits from daredevil soundtrack Bring Me To Life &amp; My Immortal. its great to hear a new and fresh band with this quality of music!! definitely worth it!
6300214184|5.0|I think I've seen \\"Flashdance\\" at least 20 times to date, considering I saw it in the theaters dozens of times when it came out in '83.  I watched it again recently and I never seem to tire of it.  I guess by now it holds a special place in my heart, a sort of sentimental movie that brings me back to my younger years.  I can practically recite the whole movie.  The music is fantastic of course.  My favourite scenes are when Alex and her boss are being romantic and the song \\"Lady\\" is playing, and also when Alex is riding her bike home on a rainy night and the boss is following her home.  Talk about romantic.  The dancing in the movie is also fabulous.  I liked all the numbers they did at the bar, Tina Tech rocked the house!!!  I also like the fashion in \\"Flashdance\\".  It started alot of trends, sort of that nu-wave grunge thing.  Jennifer Beals did a fantastic job in this film, and so did the rest of the cast.  Flashdance still rocks so get out that old cut off sweater, put on a headband and watch the coolest dance movie of all time.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is a great record and Linkin Park has improved greatly with their musical abilities. The good thing is this album is not a carbon copy of Hybrid Theory, it's much more serious and mature. The good thing is that Linkin Park has thrown out all the negativity that was involved with Linkin Park in the past and kept only the good. The good being the following six members. Mike Shinoda's ability as a rapper have increased greatly, this is displayed well on track 11, \\"Nobody's Listening\\". Chester Bennington's voice has also improved. Phoenix is great as bassist. Brad Delson has improved as a guitarist as well, we'll hear much more from him in the future. Rob Bourdon really shines on this record as the drummer. DJ Hahn is delivers as always. \\"Breaking the Habit\\" is a stand out track even if it was originally intended to be an instrumental. Even though the album is only around 36 minutes long, this is one of those rare albums where you can listen to from beginning to end non stop. Well worth the wait.
6304118392|5.0|Oliver Stone is one of the most skillful of all film directors.  His style is to take a topic, and make it an epic event while throwing every technical cinematic trick available for your consumption.  He's almost never boring, with the exception of his pro football movie.  He's usually irritating, especially when he freely admits that much of his \\"JFK\\" is fiction.  But he also usually has something relevant to say, and has never done it better than with \\"Natural Born Killers\\".<br />The movie concentrates on how our country makes celebrities out of nasty people, and was prophetic in that is was in production before the whole O.J. Simpson media bash.  It \\"tells the tale\\", to use a term in the movie, of two young lovers who leave a string of bodies across the country.  This is not that out-of-bounds, as Charlie Starkweather and his girlfriend did something like it a somewhat less bloody pace over thirty years ago.  <br />We see that instead of the revulsion that one should feel for these people, the media finds the story profitable, and they become sensations.  [Love] sells, so they find themselves on the cover of \\"People\\" magazine.  In an immortal quote from the movie, \\"fans\\" state that \\"If I were a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Malorie\\".  I frankly don't find any of this THAT far from reality, as there are people today who regard Charles Manson as a pop cult figure instead of the pathetic human that he is.  <br />All of this is surrounded by brilliant performances and editing that just blows you away.  Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are perfect because they show the capacity for violence, have charisma, and also project that they are actually pretty stupid losers having a ball with their celebrity status.  Rodney Dangerfield and Tommy Lee Jones are also priceless as Lewis' father and the warden of the prison.  <br />This is a film to be watched over and over and studied.  The Director's Cut is better, as they not only throw in previously cut scenes, but OliverStone specifically tells you why they are important.
B00005JLXC|5.0|There are a lot of people, including myself, who hold their breath each time a comic book film comes out.  We all remember how the recent Batman series turned into a big joke, and eventually died out about two films too late.  If the same thing happens to the most recent wave of Marvel-character films, it would be a big tragedy.  Some of us have been waiting all of our lives for these characters to be portrayed correctly on screen.  <br />Well, with \\"Daredevil\\", we now have three extra-base hits in a row after \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Spiderman'.  And the scenes to X-Men II look very promising.  An I've got my hopes high that \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" might even take it to a new level.   The current proprietors of Marvel deserve a standing ovation for insisting that the true spirit, and most of the rules regarding the characters are strictly kept.  In some ways, \\"Daredevil\\" may be the best of the bunch so far.<br />Possibly the best part of the movie is that it does not dumb it down in any way.  In my opinion, the accelerated dumbing-down of the Batman and Superman movies were the biggest reason they died out.  By taking the attitude that these were basically stories for kids, the greatly underestimated the intelligence of the audiences.  <br />The people who have filmed the Marvel heroes have figured out that the people who spent their childhoods with these characters have now grown up.  Yes, there remains a childlike innocence, but there literally are millions of people who take these stories as seriously as anything in movies, and they don't like it when what they like is messed with.  \\"Daredevil\\" presents a pretty bleak world, where the bad guys seem to win more often than the good guys, and good guys do get killed.  Yes, we know Daredevil will live to fight another day, but he pays a big price along the way.<br />And Ben Affleck is back on my good list again after a decent performance as Jack Ryan, and a perfect one here.  If I don't watch myself, I may actually start thinkingthat Hollywood might occasionally care about putting out a good product once in awhile
B00006AW2J|5.0|I got done with hearing \\"Sticky Fingers\\" again for the first time in awhile, so I thought I'd give another old Stones album a spin.  In this case, I had never heard the entire \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" for some reason.  I was certainly familiar with the hits on it, namely \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", probably my favorite Stones song, and \\"Street Fighting Man\\".  But the rest was pretty new stuff.  A track or two was familiar from FM-radio, but for the most part, this was a new album. <br />Guess what, folks?  The Rolling Stones are a good band.  Is that news to anyone?  In their own mold, they did their stuff as well as any band has ever done.  You have the nasty image the band cultivated, and how many other bands could have pulled off something so good with the title \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\".  It shows what great songwriters they were.  <br />There is also the reverence for the blues.  There are also the attacks on authority figures.  And finally, there is a sense of humor that you don't pick up on if you've just heard the hits.  Their tongue-in-cheek twangy \\"Dear Doctor\\" is a nice matching bookend with \\"Dead Flowers\\" from \\"Sticky Fingers\\".  This was (and I guess still is), a band that rocked very hard, but never took itself too seriously. <br /> I'll have to check for more \\"new\\" Stones albums I haven't explored.
B000002L68|5.0|I've listened to \\"Purple Rain\\" so many times I might as well write about it.  With a Hall of Fame body of work already under his belt at still a relatively young age, this might be the crowing achievement of his career so far.  <br />Very few albums have every song being on the \\"like it\\" category.  This piece of work takes it even further by contending for \\"every note fits perfectly\\" category.  I've seen the movie a few times, and as the years have gone by, the non-musical parts seem more and more silly, mostly due to horrendously bad acting by choosing to put all their buddies in the movie.  But there is no problem with the soundtrack. <br />This album shows Prince at his sexy, creative best.  He does get down and dirty, especially with \\"Darling Nikki\\", as he is expected to.  But what makes the music great is that it brings a joyous innocence to the sexuality.  \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" captures the spirit of the work very well, but it's just one great song after another.  If we could give six stars, this would get it.
B00005JL95|4.0|The reason this gets only four stars is that the bar is so high these days for children's entertainment.  This is a delightful story about a Hawaiian girl who adopts an outer space alien from a dog pound.  The alien doesn't really look like a dog, in fact it doesn't look anything like any animal on earth.  But the other dogs are so afraid of it that they are literally hiding in the rafters.  You see, the creature is a genetic experiment gone bad, which was sent by it's home planet to be shipped far away, but escapes on the way and ends up on earth.  <br />So we get the usual scenes in this kind of movie, where the adoptive family needs to adjust to the unusual new family member.  It has it's crisis moments, where it seems that the creature has to leave, and it has it's tender moments, as the bonding grows to strong for this to happen.  We then get the climax where the source of the new family member returns to claim it, and we wait breathlessly to see where it will end up.  <br />This is giving away nothing because it's the same plot that has been in dozens and dozens of stories.  This alone would put it into the one or two-star category, but it has some nice touches to make it very much worth seeing, and keeping.  The fighting between the older sister and her sibling Lilo is terrific dialog, because they have to hide it from foster agencies wanting to take her away.  The story also takes place in Hawaii, which we don't see that often in movies despite it's one-of-a-kind beauty.  Then we see that the alien is really a potentially murderous psychopath, and while we know we won't get wholesale slaughter in a Disney movie, we are apprehensive at times.  And just for the heck of it, the writers decided to give it the ability to act as a stereo speaker when it's fingernail \\"plays\\" Elvis Presley records.  This alone is worth seeing.

He is so amazing and his range and smoothness is the best i can truly say i have heard in 40 years.... how anyone could say that he does not have a wonderful voice, really needs to get their hearing adjusted.   our whole city is talking about this music wonder (and not because of his producer etc.)  because of his amazing gift!!!!!! keep these c.d.'s coming and don't pay any attention to the negative feedback...they  have their opinion too, even though nobody else could possible agree with it...Michael you and your music are truly a gift from god and I will go anytime to see you perform and buy every c.d. you  bring out..... finally some wonderful music, sung by a person who really can sing!!!
B00005IC2H|5.0|The night that I first heard &quot;Agaetis Byrjum&quot; is one that I'll always remember.  It was a dreary day in Febuary of last year that I got it, but I didn't listen to it until I was ready to fall asleep.  <br />At about 10:30 I put on some headphones and got in bed.  By the time track 2 was over I was almost asleep.  Track 3 started up slowly and pleasantly, leading me closer towards sleep then all of a sudden I was woken up compleatly.  I had just heard the most perfact musical 'hook' (for lack of a better word)that I had (and have) ever heard.  It only got better from their.  Starflurger (or whatever it's called) is the best song I had ever heard.  I was amazed.  Obviously I didn't get to sleep until about two hours later, after listening to the cd all the way through twice.<br />The first time around I was expecting a dissapointment, but it never came, each song matched the one that came before it.  I had never heard anything like it.  Thom York mixed with Bjorkesq vocals, beautiful orchistras, weird noises.  It was brilliant.  That first listen was very intense.  The second one was more relaxing as I let it slowly cary me to sleep.  I'd have to say I liked the first one better though, but every time I listen to this cd it is good.  <br />If you don't have it yet then get it.  Don't be fooled into thinking they're a mediocre band by their new cd, this one is much, much better.  Sigur Ros is one band who shouldn't of changed their style.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This CD/DVD combo is a must buy for fans of Linkin Park. The DVD is a nice extra with bonus footage of the process they went through making Meteora, but the CD is where the magic is. Every song is put together flawlessly as the CD progresses from Foreword to Numb. You can just sit down and keep the cd in for hours, the replay value is awsome just like Hybrid Theory. It's hard to pick out one or two songs that really stand out because they all have their own appeal yet are on the same scale of greatness. You just have to hear the whole CD to appreciate it. Some notable songs just for mention sake are Lying From You, Faint, Breaking the Habit, and of course Somewhere I belong. This is all coming from not just a Linkin Park fan, but a fan of all kinds of music. So do yourself a favor and check it out!

B00008H2LE|4.0|You have to give Linkin Park due credit: their lyrics are exceptional, their creative talent easily makes up for their lack of technical music proficiency, and their sophomore album, Meteora, cleverly echoes their platinum debut Hybrid Theory without ever feeling like a cheap imitation.<BR> After the brief and mildly interesting introduction, Meteora kicks off with `Don't Stay,' which sounds like the harder, darker prodigy of Hybrid Theory's `One Step Closer.'  `Somewhere I Belong' is distinctly similar to `In The End,' `Numb' follows suit with `Pushing Me Away,' `Session' is a far better instrumental number than `Cure For The Itch,' and `Easier To Run' sounds like a cross between `Crawling' and `My December.'  This comparison in essence sums up Meteora, which is essentially HT, Reanimation and a little bit of Evanescence's Fallen sliced up and served on a turntable.  The overall sound is slicker, darker, more complex and mature, and lends itself well to the fact that this is their second album.  Linkin Park also branches out a bit more this time around, taking a page from Reanimation, which cleverly escapes HT's flaw of every song sounding almost exactly the same; `Breaking The Habit' and `Nobody's Listening' are quite different than anything on HT.  A bit more variety would have been dangerous, but possibly would have made Meteora truly magnificent.<BR> \\"In the end,\\" (Sorry, I had to...) Meteora's tragic flaw is identical to that of Hybrid Theory: it's simply too short.  At 36:35, it simply ends too quickly for a full-budget album.  This is undoubtedly to make the CD radio friendly, but a bit less commercialization and a bit more music would have been nice.  As it stands, Meteora is far from a dud, and is actually a great album.  A bit more substance would have made it legendary, but it's moments of brilliance, though few and a bit too far in between, certainly make it worthy of the Linkin Park name and the status symbol that is Hybrid Theory.<br />DVD: The DVD isa nice bonus as well, and offers some nice inner sight on the making of Meteora.  It's only 30 minutes long, but is definately worth picking up if you're a serious fan of Linkin Park.

B00008H2LB|5.0|I have to admit when I first heard the songs the band released to radio stations before 3/25, I was less than impressed. I was expecting something on the order of &quot;One Step Closer&quot; for the debut single from one of the most highly anticipated albums of the year. &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; just didn't have that raw energy (or angst, for that matter). And so it was with the three other prereleased songs, &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Lying from You&quot;, and &quot;Don't Stay&quot;. But as I went through the next few days, hearing the songs on the radio, I got to the point where I couldn't get the songs out of my head. It got even worse when I bought the full CD. That's when I started to realize the point behind 'Meteora'. It's not a simple repeat of the same things we heard on 'Hybrid Theory', and it's not meant to be. It's a much different album, much like Disturbed's 'Believe' was a much different album than 'The Sickness'. Here Linkin Park have created a more intricate album, with tightly orchestrated riffs and more liberal use of samples and a synthesizer. The result, if it is possible, is an even better integration of various styles than was 'Hybrid Theory'. When you listen to 'Meteora', and then compare it to 'Hybrid Theory', the difference smacks you in the face. While 'Meteora' might not have as much of the fun/spontaneity factor, it has more than made up for it with its near-orchestral level of complexity. Bottom line, if you're willing to spend a little more time getting into this album, by all means buy it.
0385504209|1.0|... I found this book contrived, the suspense artificially manufactured, with fake cliffhangers every couple of pages.  I found the inevitable revelation was something I figured out right around page 50, so no big surprise, and I had to slog through a lot of bad writing and reams of factoids (some of them wrong, by the way).  It's like the author thinks he'll snow us with Too Much Information.  Plus a lot of the information was irrelevant mind game stuff, like the Fibonacci numbers and all that.  Why he had to go pick on Opus Dei as a villain I don't know -- I hold no brief for them, but they're just not cartoon bad guys like he makes them out to be.  And it makes no sense that the victim whose death starts out the book would put his granddaughter on this endless scavenger hunt -- that was what really felt contrived.  How anyone can compare this potboiler to \\"Name of the Rose\\" is beyond me.

0380789035|1.0|I picked this book up because I enjoyed Gaiman's Neverwhere.<br />I had expected a book that was about how America (US) is run... or might be run. Being that he titled his book with two very important words I thought that this would be a book with an important feel to it.<br />Instead... American Gods is a book that seems to be made up of Gaiman's nightmares, nightmares that no one but his therapist should be exposed to.<br />The title misleads. These are two words (American and God) that are held dear to many. This book is NOT about America and is NOT about Gods. Rather, it takes place in America and IS about nightmares.<br />I will ask Neil Gaiman to please warn us somewhere on the book about what it IS actually about.<br />I threw my copy away. For anyone considering buying this book: I strongly advise against it.
B0000028W9|4.0|I was starting to lose faith in Leonard Cohen a bit, until he released this album.  His recent releases had alternated between songs of inspired brilliance and strange concoctions with central metaphors that just didn't work or a clash between lyric content and musical style.  His work was a far cry from the all-round genius of his first few albums.  But &quot;The Future&quot; gave me a new hope for Cohen and his music.  &quot;Waiting For the Miracle&quot; is in my opinion the highlight of the album.  Cohen brings the same lyrical aptitude to issues of politics and aging that he formerly brought to romantic encounters and subsequent despair. The title track is strong also, as Cohen pushes issues of politics even farther.  &quot;Democracy&quot; rounds out the political songs with its sarcastic diatribe against what &quot;democracy&quot; has come to mean on the world stage.  The rest of the album, though no less masterful, focuses on gentler issues.  &quot;Anthem&quot; is simply a soothing, gorgeous song with strong spiritual overtones.  The romantic songs &quot;Be For Real&quot; and &quot;Light as the Breeze&quot; are not quite as strong as Cohen's earlier romantic efforts, but they are gorgeous and evocative nonetheless.  &quot;Closing Time&quot; took a while to grow on me; at first I found it cloying and cheesy.  After repeated listenings, though, the song ceases to sound overproduced and begins sounding tongue-in-cheek.  The closing instrumental piece is a new direction for Cohen; it is not particularly outstanding but it brings the album to a calm and quiet end.  I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Cohen but doesn't own it yet.  It makes an fine introduction to Cohen's work (it was the first of his albums that I owned) but I will caution that his work has a more &quot;produced&quot; sound through the years, so if you buy this and expect his earlier stuff to sound the same you will be shocked at the folksy feel of his first album.
B00005JLSE|5.0|It really helps to see the movie first (the movie/musical is excellent, even for those who don't like musicals!). All of the songs are very catchy, and will swim around in your heade for a few weeks! Great soundtrack!!! Excellent!
0393317552|5.0|I have followed all of Diamond's numerous articles in Discover magazine over the years, and his articles are always my favorites.  When I first saw this book, I could hardly wait to get it.  It did not disappoint me.  <br />I found this book to be the culmination of Diamond's life-long research, leading into many scientific disciplines.  Starting out as a young linguist in New Guinea, a man there posed a question which Diamond could not answer, but never forgot--rephrased as, &quot;Why did wealth and power become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?&quot;  Thirty years of scientific study and experience later, Diamond answers that question in his book.  It is more or less his &quot;Concise History of the World Since the Dawn of Modern Humankind.&quot;<br />This book is extraordinary.  I did not actually start reading it at the beginning.  I skipped first to the section on the rise of food production, then returned read the earlier and later sections of the book.  While the book can be read cover-to-cover, it can also be read as a series of stand-alone articles, according to the reader's interest.  <br />Enough of the book's details are covered by other reviewers.  I am a historian, and wish that all universities gave students such a course as is in this book BEFORE moving on to a more traditional study of history.
6305907145|1.0|I bought this DVD and was extremely disappointed. The 'writers' really destroyed her characters as she wrote them; they defiled Sir Thomas's character with gratituous sex drawings and introduced the subject of master/slavery sex into the story... this movie is enough to make her spin in her grave.<br />This wasn't a movie to put in the hands of those who did it.  Only those that did Pride and Prejudice for A & E have even touched on the real Jane Austen.
1587990717|5.0|Taleb's book if fantastic.  I did not buy it originally<br />because I was put off by the reviews that stated that Taleb was<br />an out-of-control egotist and name dropper.  However, I read<br />a few interviews with Taleb and he hardly seemed to fit this<br />profile.  So I ordered the book.  It is one of the best books<br />I have read this year (and I read a lot).<br />  The book is heavily infused with Taleb's work and obcession:<br />the market.  But it also covers his view of life and one of the<br />best discussions of how to think about statistics I've ever<br />read (and I collect statistics books).<br />  Taleb is a very accomplished man.  He has been a successful<br />options trader, he wrote a respected book on options and he<br />has a successful hedge fund.  You cannot do these things without<br />a healthy ego and Taleb's is indeed healthy.  He escapes being<br />an egotist because he realizes that he has the same flaws that<br />he skewers others for having.  The only difference between these<br />people and Taleb (he writes) is that he understands that he<br />has these flaws.<br />  Taleb has an unusual and fascinating world view.  He explains<br />the many sides of this view and reading this book has given me<br />things to think about for weeks after I finished.  I easily<br />believed Taleb's view that humans have a hard time thinking<br />about random events.  One of our greatest strengths is the<br />recognition of patterns.  But we also see patterns where they<br />do not exist.  In short, we are easily fooled by randomness.
B00008H2LE|4.0|I had great anticipation for the release of this album, and it's first single \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" gave me a lot of hope for the rest of the album. I didn't know what to think of it initially, probably because I keep trying to compare it to \\"Hybrid Theory\\". Once you get past the comparison, you will hear what this album truly has to offer.<br />One thing is for sure...a lot of blood, sweat and tears went into the production. If you buy the limited edition with the DVD, you will get to hear and see exactly what went into the making. I believe that the band was too worried about the failure of this album, and they overworked the heck out of it. I think they just needed to stay relaxed and let things flow naturally, and I think they'll definitely do better for the third album. It still doesn't match up to the perfection and creativity of Hybrid Theory or Reanimation. But Meteora is definitely quality and definitely worth buying. I wouldn't pass it up. <br />1 - Forward<BR>When I first popped in this CD and I heard this song, I almost thought I mistakenly put in NIN's The Downward Spiral. This short intro track sounds like the beginning to that album.<br />2 - Don't Stay<BR>Nice and powerful, sort of an angry song...it sets you up for the next track. 7/10<br />3 - Somewhere I Belong<BR>The first single released, and my favorite song on the album mostly for its lyrics. I heard it when I had broken up with my girlfriend and I was trying to find my place back in life without her, so the song really speaks to me, personally. Great catchy tune...and the power of the music matches well with the power of the lyrics. 10/10<br />4 - Lying from You<BR>This song has a good feel to it. I love the guitars in the chorus. Chester's singing is great. 9/10<br />5 - Hit the Floor<BR>Another angry song, great to rock out to. 7/10<br />6 - Easier to Run<BR>It may take me some time to like this song. The chorus is loud, but slow...to match up with the speed of the verses. 6/10<br />7 - Faint<BR>Great power, great riffs. But the first three words/notes of the chorus (\\"...I can't feel...\\") Sounds lot like Korn's \\"Got the Life\\". This I noticed immediately. Still good otherwise. 7/10<br />8 - Figure .09<BR>Not as melodic as I usually like Linkin Park's songs to be, but I really like the way this song flows. 9/10<br />9 - Breaking the Habit<BR>Somewhat of a corny chorus, but the overall feel of the song is great. Once you hear it a couple of times, it'll get in your head. I like the subtle piano in the bridge...it really adds to the chord progression at that point. 9/10<br />10 - From the Inside<BR>Very catchy, very original and powerful. I believe they really hit the nail on the head with this one. On of my other favs. 10/10<br />11 - Nobody's Listening<BR>I still don't quite know what I think of this song. Kind of simple and I like it, but it's not the best on the album. 8/10<br />12 - Session<BR>An instrumental song with a  good beat. 8/10<br />13 - Numb<BR>Great flow and rhythm. A very good way to end off the album. 9/10
B00004C4L6|4.0|Grabado a fines de 1969, el debut de Tangerine Dream es un alucinante viaje, 35 minutos de confusión, locura, experimentación y libertad sonora. Se pueden percibir ecos de Pink Floyd en algunos pasajes, pero aquí no hay canciones, sólo desenfrenados desarrollos instrumentales que parecen provenientes de alguna remota galaxia.<br />La guitarra de Edgard Froese es uno de los ejemplos más claros de lo que debería ser una sonoridad ácida, sus incursiones en Journey through a burning brain y Cold smoke ya por si solas justifican el valor del álbum. Klaus Schulze y Conrad Schnitzler por su parte hacen una notable labor en la batería el primero (gran potencia) y al cello y violin el segundo. Sumado a esto los efectos electrónicos y el órgano le dan al conjunto una densidad y riqueza aun mayor. La calidad sonora deja algo que desear, pero las condiciones de la epoca y la experiencia del grupo tampoco eran las más adecuadas.<br />Tangerine Dream jamás volvería a hacer algo similar a Electronic, aunque hubiese sido muy difícil igualar la energía y originalidad aquí presentes. Un verdadero monumento a la experimentación y una de las páginas más perturbadoras del fascinante libro de la sicodelia y del rock de vanguardia.
B000089RVX|5.0|Besides the wonderful mixing of dark drama with the almost sensous texture of Amy Lee's vocals, &quot;Fallen&quot; is sure to become a keeper in anyone's book. The feelings that arise in one's sould are apparent, even after the first sampling. The depth is unmatched, and I for one have discovered a new treasure that is quite worthy of noting.
B000002KO3|5.0|I've heard it said that pigs can have orgasms lasting for thirty minutes.  While the first half of \\"Remain In Light\\" is little more than half that amount of time, it does give one a sense of this prolonged climactic ecstasy.  RIL undoubtedly peaks with \\"The Great Curve,\\" quite possibly the best \\"dance song\\" ever made.  The infectious rhythm relentlessly picks [you] up and COMMANDS you to boogie while the skillfully multi-layered vocal parts (which happen to be great lyrics) simultaneously massage and excite the sensibilities much like, well, good [stuff].  The second half of the album cuddles the listener in a slow symphonic afterglow that is both urban and exotic.  Nearly twenty-five years after its release, I am amazed at how fresh the music still sounds.  This is partly due to the great attention given to subtle detail along with an overall disregard for kitsch.  RIL is an example of what I would call \\"genuine music.\\"  It is devoid of cliches from its own time, and (thankfully) never created new ones.  It is amazing that the 80s turned out to be such a musical wasteland considering that the decade's first year was christened by such a masterpiece.
B000003S0D|5.0|What does this album sound like ? Look at the cover !<BR>What does it feel like? Eat a bag of those orange marshmellow peanuts, drink a gallon of grape sugar-punch then ride your elephant for 40 minutes under your big tent! <br />The album is far too unorthodox and strange for 90% of the population.  I love it, with it's grand, sweeping Circus bizarreness.<br />All the fun of the Cirkus ! (Hey Ho)
B00004Z4UW|1.0|Philip K. Dick wrote better \\"the-world-you-think-is-real-isn't-really-real\\" stories in his sleep. The Matrix is the most one-dimensional treatment of this motif you could imagine. But by now every geek on the planet has grown to \\"love\\" this movie and embrace it like an anthem for a new generation. You mean we're REALLY not living in THIS world, but we're all living in pods on a human farm somewhere in New Jersey where our life essence is harvested from us by machines who have no source of energy since the sun is blocked out? To quote uberactor Keanu, \\"Whoa!\\" This movie could have had a better storyline (machines have no source of energy so they imprison and feed us to get some?????) and gotten past the most trivial non-twist in a movie since Nicholas Cage decided to just go ahead and drink himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas. How about... maybe the pod-world also isn't real, maybe there's something really real beyond that? How about maybe the pod-world is the fake world and the supposedly dream-induced world is real after all? How about maybe SOME suspense worthy of a genuine story? The motifs of questioning what is real (courtesy of PKD and the Gnostics before him) have been turned into a trivial MTV gameshow kung fu techno-action movie, a Spongebob Squarepants cartoon about the pursuit to understand the nature of reality as \\"not what it seems\\". Never mind, who cares, the geeks are all already lined up outside theatres in full costume to catch the opening of the SECOND dumbed-down sequel. Whoa...
B000003S09|5.0|One of the greatest, conceptualy original and dramatic rock albums to ever exist, and the only Crimson album with this original lineup.<BR>The violent power of the opening &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; will chase out the unwilling listeners right off the bat.  The rest of the songs are a blend of power, grace, beauty and sadness.<br />I first heard it on vinyl in 1982 at the age of 16 and from moment one it made perfect sense, like I was waiting for it all along.<br />Even still, everyone who was around the scene in 1969 asserts that this recording doesn't come off nearly as strong as this lineup's intense, intense live performances.  Lore tells that Michael Giles during drum solos would fall to the floor, hands clasped in prayer and beat out rhythms on the bass drums with his knees in total intensity.<br />The playing and musicality on the album is stellar. <BR>Barry Godbar, a friend of the band who did the album's tormented cover paintings died of a heart attack just a few short months after the albums release.
B00007JVBI|5.0|What we have here is an unconstrained masterpiece, one that will reveal itself to us slowly through the years, the melodies and counter-melodies multiplying as we process the dense simplicity of this music.<br />In a sense, this is a CD that I have been awaiting for over 30 years, the distant echo of &quot;Oar&quot; by Skip Spence. While the songs of Oar seared themselves into my consciousness in an immediate fashion, these are insinuating themselves gradually, first asserting their emotional impact through the vocals and spare arrangements. I have to say, I haven't even deciphered the lyrical content yet. <br />The comparison to &quot;Oar&quot; may be questioned, but in terms of overall sound, this sounds very much like &quot;Oar&quot;: ethereal, whispery vocals, tracks at time dominated by bass and drums, echoes, simplistic acoustic guitars with occasional electric guitar distortion and the overall rough-hewn, 'naturalistic' recording quality. <br />I doubt that Chan Marshall (Cat Power) is in quite the state that Spence was at the time he recorded his opus, and the result is even more wondrous and electrifying. And, I believe that, unlike Spence, we have much more to look forward for from this music artist. <br />It's only March and we already have the CD of the year, its only 2003 and we may already have the CD of the decade.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard of Evanescence from the Daredevil Soundtrack, which was purely a mistake. I really only bought the DD sndtrck for Nickelback's &quot;Learn the Hard Way&quot;, but decided to give the rest of the CD a listen as well. <BR>Well, once the opening chords of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; began, I was smitten. Amy Lee's voice, the powerful music behind her, and the depth of the lyrics had me spellbound, and I couldn't get enough of it. So, when I saw they had a CD coming out shortly thereafter, I bought it the very day it was released.<BR>I have not been sorry about the purchase. &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Going Under&quot; are two of my other favorites from the CD, but really the whole thing is just as captivating as those songs. Hauntingly deep and brooding, the songs also have an edge to them. Amy Lee is a brilliant vocalist and adds the perfect touch to the style of music. I highly, highly recommend this CD and cannot wait to see what Evanescence comes out with next!
B00007AJGH|3.0|\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" is a hybrid of genres: a film noir murder mystery grafted onto the hyper-text of the animated cartoon. The plot centers on washed up detective, Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins).  Shifting between his own inner demons of a brother who was killed on a case and his alcoholism, Eddie's luck appears to take a turn for the better when R.K. Maroon hires him for a cheap and easy snoop job. But the job is a set up directly linking the murder of a night club owner to the mystery behind a missing last will and testament. Roger (voiced by Charles Fleischer), a five foot tall animated rabbit is the prime suspect. He and Eddie go together like oil and water but with the help of Roger's lusty busty wife, Jessica (voiced by Kathlene Turner) the two embark on a burgeoning friendship destined to save Los Angeles from the dreaded Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd).   At the time of its release the seamless blend of traditional animation and live action won Disney and Touchstone a host of accolades and the respect of the entire industry, not to mention a couple of technical achievement Oscars for good merit. However, in the intermission between 1988 and the present this sort of complexity has become rather pass (seen in everything from theater promos to television commercials). Thus in retrospect the film has dated much more as a clich than might be expected. Instead of maintaining timelessness there is the faint odor of formaldehyde teeming from the cheering sidelines of animation's finest and most enduring creations. Everyone from Bugs Bunny to Betty Boop appear in cameos but the effect no longer enthralls as much as it seems the expected sideline to an otherwise stagy cinematic experience.  The original DVD release of \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" was not anamorphic and although that problem has been rectified on Touchstone's newly minted two disc special edition, there remains a host of digital anomalies that seem new to this incarnation. In a pre-digital domain environment of editing, the source elements for the duped and animated plates in this film seem exceptionally worn, suffering from a barrage of dirt and scratches. Screen flutter is excessive in almost every scene in which cartoons and humans interact. There are also a few cases where either the human element or the cartoon characters appear slightly out of focus. Shadow effects on animated characters create a disturbing and distracting halo effect that is unflattering to say the least. Digital grit is at times excessive, especially in the opening cartoon sequence. Fine details occasionally shimmer. Colors are overall well balanced. But there are a few inconsistencies. For example, watch how Roger's red pants change from red to orange, then back to red, throughout the film. Also, \\"the Red Car\\" street cars register more orange than red. All of these problems, I suspect, are the result of cramming too much info on one disc.   Even though this is a two disc set, Disney/Touchstone has reserved the first disc for a full frame copy of the movie and an audio commentary only. The rest of the features, including an extensive array of well produced documentaries, deleted scenes, trailers and other extras, have all been crammed onto disc #2 along with the widescreen version of the film. The result is less than optimal picture quality. The sound for both versions of the film is a 5.1 remix that is identical to the previously issued DVD. It is strident and shrill at times and very well balanced at other moments. With all the hype surrounding this re-issue, more should have been expected and delivered from the folks over at Disney.
B000002IWQ|5.0|This is a bit late in the game, I realize; I was trying to find  the order of songs on this CD when I got hooked into reading all the reviews. I couldn't resist adding my own since, like most of you, I value my own opinion the most :)<br />This is rock for adults. Rush is one of the most original bands out there; but that does not mean that they do not recognize and embrace musical trends. They realize that they do not live in a vacuum. Unlike some other one-trick bands such as AC/DC to cite one example, they have the ability to take what they like and incorporate it into their own sound. Does that mean they are derivative? By no means. To say that Alex copied the Seattle grunge sound on this effort is to get it backwards and ignore Rush's own contribution to rock; most of the grunge bands which the uninformed claim that Rush is imitating in actuality list Rush among their own influences. <br />Who's imitating whom? (another thinly-veiled AD/DC reference)<br />Guitar Player magazine--a magazine for professional guitarists--consistently lists Alex among the most influential guitarists in rock. He has been voted Best Rock Guitarist on several occasions--an honor that is voted on and bestowed by actual, professional guitarists who know what goes into the craft, not armchair reviewers who mistake flash for technique. In the percussion world, Neil had been similarly influential and honored; ditto Geddy on bass. Yet they all remain real people.<br />By no means am I a rosy-glass Rush fan who insists they can do no wrong (case in point: \\"Big money goes aROUND the world!\\") but I have to shake my head when I read reviews like some of the ones I've seen here. To those of you who said the cd bogs down/slows down in the middle, you need to stop reading other people's reviews and lifting their ideas in an effort to sound like a real reviewer. There is a concept known as \\"pacing\\" in which the arrangement of songs follows a logical progression of thought and energy. If every songwas the same speed/heaviness/etc the end effect would be wearying. As for boggin/slowing down in the middle; do you have the same CD as I do? Because, if I'm not mistaken, \\"Alien Shore\\" is smack dab in the middle (track 6). By what measure does that slow the pacing? \\"Leave That thing Alone\\" (track 9) cannot by any stretch be said to be a slow song. I defy anyone to remain still during Neil's brilliant ride cymbal work in the chorus of \\"Cold Fire\\" (track 10). I suspect someone was put off by \\"Speed of Love\\" (track 7) and \\"Everyday Glory\\" (11) because they didn't have the frenetic pace of \\"Animate\\" and arrived at the brilliant conclusion that the second half bogged down; the rest of you picked it up like the bad meme that it is. There is not a bad song on the CD; that being said, I realize that many people will not care for \\"Stick it Out\\" because of it's unconventional harmonies. <br />If you want all your songs to have the same beat, pace, sound, etc. then I suggest you skip Rush and go get yourself one of the many interchangable post-Bonn Scott AC/DC albums out there.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. And it is much better than Ocean's Eleven(even though that movie rocked). Brad Pitt did an amazing job as the incoherent irish gypsy(I just wish I could talk like that). And... well dont listen to these people that say the movie is terrible. They obviously must think that movies like Crossroads and Charlie's Angels are good entertainment. Bah!
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of the best bands I've heard in awhile. I like a wide range of music and they're very good. The CD has a good mix of different song types. Gothic rock and some with piano. If you liked the song &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; then you'll love the album.They're a talented group that I would like to see go far. My favorite songs would have to be Hello, My Immortal, Haunted, and Tourniquet. Of course all songs are good. Not just a few. Buy this CD and support them! They're damn good!
B000001Y2U|5.0|'Antichrist Superstar' is Marilyn Manson's greatest release today. Althought I still love 'Portrait of An American Family' and 'Holywood' is also great. I still can listen to superstar, over and over and over again.<br />All the tracks on this album, are great, dark, sick and simply classics.<br />This kind of music usually dont appeal to appeal to alot of people, because of the image of the artist. But if you love Manson Go Get This Album.<br />Track Ratings:<br />1. Irresponsible Hate Anthem - **** Outta 5 - Great Start, To and even greater album.<BR>2. Beautiful People - ***** - Great Song, Prolly Manson's biggest song to date.<BR>3. Dried up, Tied and Dead to the World - **** - Great, Dark Song.<BR>4. Tourniquet - ***** - Very Disturbing Song.<BR>5. Little Horn - *** - Prolly The Worst On Album. But still Great.<BR>6. Cryptorchild - ***** - Dark and Weird.<BR>7. Deformography - **** - Great Beat.<BR>8. Wormboy - ***** - Great Lyrics. Very Good Song.<BR>9. Mister Superstar - ***** - Love this Song. Also Great Lyrics.<BR>10. Angel With the Scabbed Wings - **** - Love this One.<BR>11. Kinderfeld - **** - Another very good song.<BR>12. Antichrist Superstar - ***** - Title Track and very Great Song.<BR>13. 1996 - ***** - Fast Paced and Good Lyrics. Good Song<BR>14. Minute Of Decay - **** - Great Song.<BR>15. Reflecting God - ***** - Dark Lyrics, Love this Song.<BR>16. Man That You Fear - ***** - Great Song, Maybe the best On album. Also Great lyrics.
B00008H2LE|4.0|I agree with you for the most part.  This album was a great addition to Linkin Park's series of music and I am really enjoying it.  Overall the song variety was good.  They have a great mixture of bassy rap with some really fun beats, and at the same time they have somehow blended in heavy rock with great vocals.  In my opinion the best put together songs of this cd are &quot;Lying From You&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, and &quot;Figure .09&quot;.  No matter whether they pulled too much of the style of out their old songs for &quot;.09&quot; or not, it is still a very catchy song.  I recommend this cd to anyone.  The cd holds a very wide variety and I'm definately not tireing of it.
0739302752|4.0|My first rule of reading business how-to books is to check the author's credentials. If they say the word &quot;consultant&quot; in the bio, I usually put it back on the shelf with all the other books written by Ivy League MBAs who never held a real job in their lives. But when I saw that Honeywell/Allied Signal kahuna and GE alumnus Larry Bossidy had a hand in this work, it caught my eye, and I got the CD set to listen to on the road.<br />The highlight of the CD set is Bossidy's commentary. He is direct and straightforward, though I'm not sure I'd like working for him. He seems to be the type of boss who will find a flaw in your performance no matter how good you are doing, though if I were in management right now, I'd think that is a good thing. The concept of &quot;robust dialog&quot; and confronting personnel about their performance and coaching them to do better is a very valuable tool.<br />Towards the end, &quot;Execution&quot; kind of sketches over strategic planning and budgeting, without going into detail . . .  as if these are things that can be done half-asleep, and I've been in enough companies to know that this is not the case.<br />Maybe not enough for the &quot;little guy&quot; to put to use, but &quot;Execution&quot; does a great job at showing managers how to segregate good ideas from good results. Managers listening to this CD set or reading he book will learn how not to drown in a sea of great ideas that never get acted upon.
B00005JLSC|4.0|Haven't read all the reviews from all the 'Amazoners', and I may be the only one...ok my husband and I may be the only ones!! But here goes: Chicago was excellent in every way..except one. The music, the acting, the dancing, the costumes- heck, we're musicians and LOVE musicals! It does our hearts good to see them being made. That said, the only bit of criticism is that this movie's  general message was dark and cynical. Do we need more cynicism and sarcasm in a society where there's no shortage! This may sound hokey, but the arts have an opportunity to elevate and inspire massive groups of people in a truly positive way. And we need it! That was the disappointment to us. For that, I wouldn't have given it Best Picture. Otherwise, yes, as so many have said, it was truly a work of art. I sincerly hope<BR>this much effort, money, star-power, creativity etc can be put into many more musicals to come! And may they see the possibility.
B000088E6D|1.0|I have bought this CD along with Linda Eder's and neither one of them live up to the hype. Buble is a Sinatra Copy Cat and Eder is a Streisand Copy Cat. Buble has the advantage that Sinatra isn't here anymore, but that's about it. Neither artist can compare with the original Great artists, and shouldn't have tried. Both of these new singers should find their own style. <BR>Both could be good recording artists on their own. They should sing something original, and quit trying to copy other artists.
B000001DQI|5.0|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is PERFECTION. From &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot; to &quot;Harmony&quot; an absolute joy to listen to. The songs speak of just about everything. A musical ecyclopedia from melody to lyrics. Well known hits: &quot;Bennie and The Jets&quot;, &quot;Saturday night's alright for fighting&quot; and the album's title are just the tip of the iceberg. Others worth noting have to be &quot;All the Girls love Alice&quot;, &quot;Roy Rogers&quot; &quot;Social Disease&quot;, &quot;Your Sister can't Twist (but she can Rock-N-Roll)&quot; and &quot;Candle in The Wind&quot;. This album is the album that all artists wish they could make. A true classic in every sense.
B00007H1Y2|2.0|ry cooder could have had a much more grandiose farewell from his investigations of afro cban music. this soundslike a forced goodbye...he tried too hard. the previous records were delightful. this is not quite up there
B00008H2LE|5.0|Great CD....period.  It sounds somewhat like Hybrid Theory, but there are some subtle differences.  They seem to have taken more chances and put in a lot of work on each song.  Just put the CD in and get ready to bob your head.
B00008AY3L|4.0|One thing noteworthy of Ben Harper, as mentioned dozens of times already, is his dynamic ability to mix, blend, and master all sorts of musical genres.  Diamonds on the Inside proves no different, with Ben expanding onto far more musically diverse ground than on any of his previous albums.  The end result of this is somewhat mixed.  <br />Diamonds seems to be a coming of age album for Ben.  Lyrically it's solid, by far his most mature effort to date.  His musical abilities have also grown immensly.  Ben nails to perfection the acoustic/folk/slide-guitar rock that he patented on Welcome to the Cruel World and Fight for Your Mind.  \\"When It's Good\\" finds Ben up and down his guitar like a virtuoso. \\"Touch From Your Lust\\" is reminisent of a dark and distorted Jimi Hendrix, and  \\"Diamonds on the Inside\\" never ceases to amaze me.  To this day, I still cannot believe pop-country feel to the song, and how Ben absolutely does it to perfection.  <br />There are a few times when Diamonds goes amiss.  The hardrock anthems at the end of the album sound like a poor excuse for Lenny Kravitz.  On Bring the Funk, Ben misses the ball both lyrically and with his vocal performance. And She's Only Happy in the Sun doesn't really compare to the stripped down and raw acoustic efforts of Ben's past (Walk Away, Another Lonely Day).  Although, I think once brought to the acoustic, When She Believes will make up for it.    <br />Overall, I can't knock this album.  It's musical diversity and refreshing nature is something that is all to uncommon to today's music.  The album is musical journey all in itself, and, for the most part, it's easy driving.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Those of you hardcore Linkin Park fans out there will have to excuse me for the brief few seconds of reading that this will take. Personally, I am a huge fan of music that has an extremely hard edge and is fast and aggressive. Linkin Park's first release \\"Hybrid Theory\\" had a mixed bag of hard edge, fast pace, and the calm sections that fit where they were placed. It was a great album from a band that has a great future ahead of them, that is if they don't screw it up. Before I get clubbed to death, I don't think Linkin Park [messed] up on \\"Meteora\\". What angers me most is the drastic change that this album takes at the end.<br />  \\"Meteora\\" may be short, but as the listener trails through the first eight tracks the sound seems to travel very well. Transitions were great and the flow was just as good and this is the way all short albums should run. The problem comes at track eleven, \\"Nobody's Listening\\". In the booklet, they comment on how this track seemed distant from the rest of the album. I would like to know what made them think that it did fit because, frankly, it doesn't even sound like it belongs on the CD. The mass electronic sounds of different kinds puts this track on a new level of music and doesn't even hold it to the actual order. The track severely breaks the listening experience and made me say, \\"What the...\\".<br />  Not only this, but remember the above comment about being a fan of \\"hard edged music\\" above. Guess what folks, this album doesn't carry much of one. In fact, in some cases I think that they concentrated too much on sampling development and not enough on sound. From my many listening sessions since I acquired this CD, I can say that \\"Meteora\\" is a great listening experience and has nice movement, but the lacking hard edge and that one annoying track leave me kind of awestruck.<br />  Keep in mind, I don't hate the CD, I hate one track on the CD. Also, I look forward to seeing them in July because I am going to the Summer Sanitarium show. The standouts are many on this CD as well. Tracks like \\"Don't Stay\\", \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", \\"Lying My Way From You\\", \\"Easier to Run\\", and \\"Breaking the Habit\\" are only a few of my favorites. Of course, that's just my opinion I could be wrong.ium show. The standouts are many on this CD as well.

1402511787|3.0|I loved this novel until the coincidental event, on which it turns, occurs. That happens in part one. A major book should not rely on happenstance for its pivotal moment. I found sections two and three readable as well, and fortunatley not as predictable.  The reader is left to trust that the word of a 13 year old Briony, is enough to alter the lives of so many. I also found it disappointing not to delve into Leon's and Marshall's role. Briony becoming a nurse did not seem a convincing choice for her, although the perhaps this training rooted her in reality and enabled her develop and mature enough to see what she had wrought. The reader's satisfaction is snatched away at the end, as atonement is implicated than never realized.
B00006RU5B|3.0|This was supposed to be the coming together of one of the most talented vocalists on the planet at this time with a very talented band.The disc is a disc worth having for Cornell fans, but it is not as mind blowing as I had expected, the collaboration of some of the nations top musicians should be something that could and should rival the old leaders like the Beatles or The Stones, yet we get something that is rage with a SInger, not a rapper now. I hope the next album comes out a lot stronger.
0385504209|1.0|I must confess that I found this book to be something of a page-turner in the beginning, but as the true motive of this book came to the surface my interest quickly fell off.  This book is just your standard Catholic bashing dressed up as \\"intellectual fiction\\".  Well, fiction it is but the intellectual description will only sit well with the \\"aliens killed Kennedy\\" crowd.<br />Any doubts about the motives of this book quickly disappear when you see the author advertising web sites that also promote his anti-catholic message.  Do yourselves a favor and skip this book.  If you have any belief in Christianity, you will be offended by this fiction.  Even the fans of outlandish conspiracy theories really will have to stretch their imagination to buy this.  For those who don't fit into either of these categories, don't confuse this book for truth.  It is in the fiction category for a reason.
B00008H2LE|5.0|this work is more 'artistic' than the previous released &quot;Hybrid theory&quot; ,I can say for the way they express their music,their artwork,without loose their style;is a well-built album,the dvd bonus extras are excellent,maybe this one don't enjoy the millions of copies of &quot;Hybrid&quot; but I would say is the best of the two.
B000002UAX|1.0|This is, put simply, one of the worst albums I have ever listened to. I listened to the first 30 seconds or so of the first song, and hated it. Then i skipped to 'good night' and listened to those violins fading out, only for the satisfaction of knowing that the piece of GARBAGE was finally over. Don't give that warmonger Lennon and his cronies any of your hard-earned money (there was a reason he died, you know). It doesn't even have 'Yesterday' on it! You do the math.
B000002GJS|1.0|This album is downright bad. Songs and lyrics range from stupid to horrendeous. I like 80's music and but this is just too much. Its beyond cheesy, dry, overproduced and entirely laughable - think a mutant cross of van-halen, def leppard and shania twain. Nothing works here at all from the dull rock attempts to the tired ballads.<br />This is one of the worst examples of corporate rock I've heard by a famous artist.
0316666343|5.0|I can honestly say I haven't read a book in a while that I found so endearing.  I didn't want to put it down, and when I finished reading it I was disappointed it had to end.  I would highly recommend this book, it was an emotional and thought provoking read that I thoroughly enjoyed.
B00008H2LB|5.0|When I first got this CD I was really excited to listen to it, after all it had been along time since Hybrid Theory. When I first listened to it I thought that it was ok, but not as good as Hybrid Theory. After a few more times through the CD, the songs started to get a lot more catchy. I started noticing more of the guitars and the drums. And now...I think that it is way better than Hybrid Theory! <br /> And I just had to say one more thing...that this CD seems a lot harder than Hybrid Theory. But that is a good thing! They still add lots of a hip-hop sort of style. An awesome combination!<br /> My advice...Buy this CD! And if at first you don't like it, just listen through the CD a couple more times like I did. I don't know if it will change your mind about the CD but...Hey!
B000002GFC|5.0|Great collection of tunes, including more of their earlier stuff than many other compilations I've seen. Good rock for everybody.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I agree there really isn't much of a difference between Meteora and Hybrid Theory but if you liked the first than you'll like this one.  My only gripe is that the album is SO SHORT.  The best songs are Faint, From The Inside and Numb.
B00005JLXC|5.0|This obviously the best marvel comic hero movie ever made. The special effects are outstanding. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner bring out the best in this movie with their intense stunts and acting. This is a must see to all fans and non fans of this comic hero. It's a movie with a true meaning. I'm going to watch it again for the 5th time.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This Cd is Linkin Park at their finest.  Every song has the perfect lyrics with the perfect beat and rythem.  They have combined Hip-Hop and Rock to come out with what could be some of their greatest work ever.  It is impossible to think that they could come up with greater results.  Mike and Chester gave 110% into their singing and then some.  Brad and Phoenix played their role with exterme expertise.  Rob's preformance on the drunds couldn't be matched.  And Joe's record spining move couldn't be out matched.  This is linkin Park at their best 36 minutes of their careers!
0064407667|1.0|I would not recommend giving this book to a child.  The message it sends is one of hopelessness.  Its plot centers around the abuse and blackmail of newly-orphaned children, and it smacks of pedophilia.  (The villian blackmails a fourteen year-old girl into marrying him by dangling her baby sister from a tower, then speaks of his bride going home with him for their \\"wedding night\\".)<br />Don't waste your money.  There are many wonderfully written children's books out there that are in much better taste.
B00008H2LB|3.0|the new album meteora is a copy to the hybrid theory cd and in fact that \\"easier to run\\" is [bad] only 3 song that strengthed this album that is somewhere i belong,lying from you and dont stay.I noticed that \\"numb\\" sounds a bit \\"runaway\\" from hybrid theory.<BR>nevertheless if you really like lp you should buy this disc.<BR>i prefer that you all listen to breaking benjamin instead of this.
B000069HK2|2.0|this band sounds like the lead is choking on his vomit and smoking a joint while doing it. the only people who can stand this music for any length of time are recreational stoners who got tired of listening to rap and want to call themselves hard. yea, right, this cd is so hard. maybe I'm just cynical. I dunno. I can't find the quality in this music. I'll give them two points because at least they can get air time on major stations, which is something that rarely happens for most &quot;punk&quot; and &quot;metal&quot; bands.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice For All(1988). Metallica's fourth studio album and first with bassist Jason Newsted.<br />For the longest time, I hesitated in listening to this album. Most old-Metallica fans I knew said that the production on this album is downright horrible and that it was too progressive sounding to be any good. Puppets and Lightning were the only albums that they praised and I had listened to those so many times that I just wanted more. But I was afraid to give Justice a try because of what I'd been told. Finally, I changed my mind and bought it a short while ago. I was a little weary, that is....<br />...until I actually listened to it.<br />And now it is one of my all-time favorite metal cds. Metallica recovered from the tragic loss of their former bassist Cliff Burton, and used their rage to bring forth their angriest, heaviest, and most lyrically insighted release yet. Most of it is about death again, though political issues are also thrown in. Yes, the production could be alot better and Newsted's bass guitar amplifier should have been plugged in, but once you increase the volume and get into the first riffs of Blackened, these flaws become very trivial and you hardly even notice them at all. And people were saying that it's too progressive?? Come on! I can think of many bands that make this album look simple in comparison.<br />Now onto the tracks: Blackened is a high-octane thrash number that kick-starts the album PERFECTLY, the same way that Fight Fire With Fire and Battery started off the previous albums. Shortest Straw and Dyers Eve are the two other speedy tracks on here, and both are incredible. Eye Of The Beholder and Harvestor Of Sorrow are more midpaced, and Frayed Ends Of Insanity is slower, but all are as equally impressive as the fast ones. The title track is nothing short of spectacular, and To Live Is To Die is a heavy, yet melodic instrumental. Parts of this instrumental were actually written by Cliff Burton shortly before he died (the band ended up tributing the song to him when it was completed). The only song that received any radio-play off of here was One, due to its similarity to the previous doom-&-gloom ballads Fade To Black and Welcome Home Sanitarium. Like its predecessors, One starts out slow and then turns into vintage frantic thrash. It also contains one of the greatest guitar solos ever played by Kirk Hammet. If anything is to be noticed, its that James Hetfield's vocals never sounded better. His voice matured enough to finally rid himself of his shrieking that was apparent on previous albums, and now he delivers perfect growls and true emotional angst in the best way that he has ever done.<br />Sadly, this is the last \\"true\\" Metallica album as they were discovered by MTV and big label producers in the following years. So they dumped the progression and thrash stylings that they were so well known for in favor of a radio-friendly sound. It worked out alright with the Black album(1991), but definitely not afterwards. I give Justice five stars hands down for solid musicianship and powerful song execution. There was some bad production values, but I did not feel that they were enough to take away from the overall quality of the album. No Metallica collection is complete without this. Many blamed Metallica's sudden change to commercialism on Cliff Burton's untimely death, but Justice alone proved that they could still carry on the same style without him. To this day, Metallica has never topped Puppets or Justice. Will they ever regain their senses? I guess I'll have to keep waiting...

B000002KHH|5.0|Whether you are a fan of modern metal, nu-metal, heavy metal, death metal, or thrash metal, there's no denying where all of it originated - with Ozzy Osbourne and the gang. With such memorable classics as \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"War Pigs,\\" in this album, Black Sabbath defined metal, and helped to lay the foundation that every metal band since has built upon. \\"Paranoid\\" is one of the most influential albums in metal history. With Tony Iommi's new style of heavy, catchy guitar rhythms and Ozzy's growling, unforgettable voice, Black Sabbath told the world what heavy metal was. The only weakness is the sound quality, which is, unfortunately, second-rate. Fans of all types of hard rock and metal have enjoyed this album for more than thirty years, and will for countless more to come.

B00004VXF2|3.0|I thought I would put up my thoughts on this mid-70's experimental recording. This is Metal Machine Music- the noisy feedback album of the Velvet Underground's famous front man Lou Reed. This album has become so notorious through word of mouth now that people tend to seek it out out of curiosity. Everybody wants to hear it at least once. And everybody should. Do we really know why it was released? Well, no, not really. Lou's not the first artist to release a noise album and he certainly won't be the last. My only gripe about this recording is that he should have pushed it a little further. I realize he probably had some sort of objective with this album and that it wasn't ever meant to be good. But had he taken it a step or two further, such as recording some spoken word over it, or a strange vocal line or two, it would have sparkled with in a brighter dimension. Nobody that I know has actually played this thing from start to finish, and the reason for that is it doesn't change. It's just pure loud jarring feedback and nothing more. Those who do listen to it and analyze it say that there is stuff going on deep inside the wall of feedback. I agree, this isn't a 68 minute tape loop repeating infinitely. The sound shifts, noises and oddities can be heard thick inside the barrier of tones. However, there is not enough going on to really justify pulling this album out once a month and playing it from start to finish. I wish it had something more going on so that I COULD pull it out once a month. But it's not for me to say how Lou SHOULD have recorded this album. He did it the way he wanted to and it's available quite easily for all the world to hear. Will you enjoy this album? Well, as many have said before, it's not music. It's not songs. It has no lyrics. No chord changes. No tempos. No various instruments. It's a full-on wall of noise. Two albums worth. It's a curio. It's spit in the face. It's a statement. Would you be better off going out and spending your hard earned money on two Clash CD's instead? Yes. But if you're a fan of avant garde, and you admit to owning (and maybe even spending big bucks on) strange little odd LP's like John and Yoko's Life With The Lions, then this is the album for you. If you're a fan of avant garde that actually tries to make some kind of sense, you might want to skip this one and seek out an odd Thurston Moore release. In the old days of records there used to be something called the cut-out bin where you could find albums like this lurking for around the price of a pack of bubble gum. Nowadays you have to do a little research on an album to find out if it truly is &quot;the one for me.&quot; The reviews posted here so far are great for helping out the cautious buyer. He or she is provided with enough information and reviews to make the decision whether or not to slap down the cash for this baby. I'm glad I bought it. I've enjoyed it, though I've probably never played more than five minutes of it at a time. But I've had fun playing around with it, comparing the four &quot;songs,&quot; looking for little clues that may one day be used in some good coctail party conversation. This is the type of album that generates talk at a coctail party. Nobody's going to sit around for an hour discussing a 1976 Boston album, but start talking about Metal Machine Music and there's no telling where the conversation will lead. Everybody has a different point of view, a different angle to this monster. Just don't end up being the one that says &quot;never heard of that one.&quot; You wouldn't want to be left out, now would you?!?
B000001FND|5.0|Ahh the early years! Still in their teens, the brothers produce beautiful song after beautiful song on their follow up to the classic Bee Gees 1st. A classic in it's own right, Horizontal is full of memorable tunes with catchy melodies,thought provoking and sometimes eccentric lyrics, and stunning musical arrangerments. <BR> There are songs that are whimsical and humorous, and songs whose lyrics can make you cry. 'Day Time Girl' is one of the most beautiful songs the Bee Gees have ever recorded, and it's not even the best song on this disc! 'World' is out of this world,and the title cut makes one float away. There is plenty of great guitar work by Vince Melouney, bass by Mo, and vocal work which features the brothers at the top of their game.<BR> Robin's 'And The Sun Will Shine' and 'Really And Sincerely' just tug at the heart strings. Barry and Vince team up on 'The Change is Made' to create a bluesy masterpiece.<BR> The intentionally silly 'Harry Braf' counterbalances the many songs that are sad.  'Birdie Told Me','The Earnest Of Being George', and'Lemons Never Forget' (how's that for some original titles?) , feature the Brothers at their creative best. <br />Horizontal is inventive and unique, well produced and arranged, and beautifully performed. Every song is a winner, and they flow together perfectly.<br /> It's hard to believe that Horizontal was released less than a year after 1st was released. Prolific,enthusiastic and young!, the Bee Gees demonstrated to the world talent that was undeniable. And by creating an album where the memorable 'Massachusets' is almost an afterthought, it's easy to see why the Bee Gees are truly legendary. <br /> Horizontal absolutely must be part of any Bee Gees fan collection---- Indeed, part of any music lover's collection.
B000088E6D|1.0|What is with this guy trying to sound exactly like Frank Sinatra?<BR>Lounge, Lounge and more Lounge. David Foster must be getting old.<BR>Sinatra kicked, this guy lays down on almost every song. I think it's terrible, trying to launch someone at the expense of a wonderful singer like Sinatra. I think Buble should be titled the new Karaoke King. He would win grammys in that category!<BR>This album is terrible. Buy a Sinatra CD and enjoy!
B00008H2LE|5.0|Like most all big Linkin Park fans, i was very anxious to hear meteora and hear what LP had to bring. This cd was not as good as hybrid theory, but hybrid theory is one of my favorite cd's ever. Meteora is still an excellent cd, and after a couple listens it grows on you, and you don't want to stop listening. They have quite a good blend of rock songs, and rap songs. There are some songs that are a little different sounding for them but it's good to see their range as musicians.Chester is still one of my favorite vocalists, along with david draiman of disturbed, and makes songs from being good to great. Some of my favorite tracks are, Lying From You, Hit The Floor, Faint, Figure.09, Dont Stay, and Nobody's Listening. Overall another great effort from these 6 guys. definitely pick up the cd.
0064471837|5.0|From the mystery-shrouded prologue to the happy ending, Garth Nix holds us in his Charter-spell with Sabriel.<br />At a girls' boarding school in modern Ancelstierre, 18-year-old Sabriel gets a message that her father, a sort-of necromancer called Abhorsen, is in trouble. She ventures into her native land, the Old Kingdom, where there is plenty of good Charter-magic but no modern technology. She realizes she must take her father's place as the Abhorsen and fight the evil Kerrigor. Armed with her magical, Charter-marked sword and her necromancer's bells, she sets out to find her father. On the way, she meets many enemies, but also steadfast friends in a man nicknamed Touchstone and a cat named Mogget. (Well, Mogget's steadfast only as long as his collar's on... read the book to find out why.)<br />Garth Nix can do it all. He creates a wonderful, breathtaking plot that will keep this book glued open, facing your eyes. He describes a new world filled with magic both good and horribly evil. And he breathes life into three unforgettable characters: the clever, unpredictable Mogget, the endearing and persistent Touchstone, and of course Sabriel herself. If you want a superb high fantasy story that will leave you breathless, Sabriel is for you.
0345448898|5.0|These books are on the very top of my list. I have read them each twice and each time finding new depth and meaning to every word. As an avid reader i have found nothing more enjoyable to many ages as the Dark Materials Trilogy. It is a must-read book for everyone no matter what the beleifs. His portrayal of each religion is superior in its content and deliverance. There are no equals to these books and give it only the highest praise. YOU MUST READ THESE BOOKS!!
B000002A3T|1.0|Here is a completly objective review: this album [stinks]. The \\"atmouspheric\\" sounds are cold and hostile, the melodies and hooks are feeble, the lyrics are ...drivel, and the (over)production is disturbing and alienating.<BR>   Fans of this album always claim that those who critisize it only do so because they are \\"pro-waters\\", and don't give it a chance... The real issue here is that people are blind in their worship of \\"pink floyd\\", and are willing to accept and be brainwashed in to thinking that this [stuff] has something of value, which it most certainly does not. It's an insulting parody of what pink floyd used to be. Gilmore, Wright, and Mason have officially joined the ranks of sell-outs, and I hope they're happy. Roger Waters and Syd Barrett are the only members of the group I have respect for anymore.
B000065VB9|5.0|Although not his biggest commercial success, this Peter Gabriel album is his most triumphant (and sometimes uncomfortable) work...every track is a winner.  Gabriel's gift as a songwriter has always been to create \\"moody\\" songs, usually with a foreboding or creepy edge.  His voice, of course, is well suited to that style.  In this album, we get to hear him in his best, most-varied voice, and the music behind the voice is about as varied as you're likely to hear.<br />INTRUDER  Told in the first person (as many of his songs about \\"troubled\\" protagonists are), this song celebrates a burglar...kinda.  In this case, the intruder breaks in to the home, but maybe not to steal.  It is implied that he mostly likes the rush of going through drawers and jewelry, and watching his victims sleeping, or even enjoying their fear when they sense he is there.  Creepy stuff, with a great, pouding percussion (provided in part by Phil Collins).<br />NO SELF CONTROL:  Similar to his later, excellent I HAVE THE TOUCH, the observations of a person obsessed with making contact.  Obviously a loner, reaching out in inappropriate ways:<br />\\"Got to pick up the phone<BR>I will call any number<BR>I will talk to anyone...<BR>Street after street<BR>Night after night<BR>I walk on through the rain...\\"<br />I DON'T REMEMBER  The album's most \\"rockin'\\" song, if that's what you're looking for.  The narrator has lost his sense of identity.<br />FAMILY SNAPSHOT  First person again, this time about an assasin, in the moments right before he takes his fatal shot at the president.  Inspired by the Kennedy killing (he even mentions the governor), but the motivations have to deal more with an unhappy childhood.  The psychology is a bit pat and easy, but the song itself (with lots of tempo and time signature changes) is unforgettable, and Gabriel's emoting has never been better.  It's one of my favorite.<br />AND THROUGH THE WIRE  Don't claim to know what this one is about, but it jams!!<br />GAMES WITH FRONTIERS  An early Gabrial \\"single\\" I remember the video from YEARS ago.  A great song to sing along with, about how the spitting matches and wars between our leaders really resembles a kids game.  It's an upbeat song with a downbeat message...instantly hummable though.<br />NOT ONE OF US:  Explores how one group may reject others who don't look or act like they do.  Another upbeat tempo song, with a somber message.<br />NORMAL LIFE  Mostly an instrumental, but there's a brief verse halfway through:<br />\\"Its nice here with a view of the trees<BR>Eating with a spoon, they don't give you knives<BR>'spect you watch those trees, blowing in the breeze<BR>We want to see you lead a normal life.\\"<br />That's it.  But you've got to hear it in the context of the music.  A beautiful, even touching song.<br />BIKO  One of Gabriel's crowning moments, keeping alive in very simple lyrics the life of South African freedom activist Stephen Biko (see the movie CRY FREEDOM with Denzel).  It's incredibly evocative, and the kind of song that in concert becomes a rallying cry.  Has the power to raise goosebumps.<br />If you are looking for intelligently crafted music that isn't all lightness and fluff, check out this brilliant, haunting work!
B00004Z459|5.0|If you rip this album then you must be stuck in old ways of Led Zepplin or Pink Floyd or somethin.  Music is changing and these guys are startin it and [] i like it this is his my fav album and band!!  These guys rock!  Listen to the lyrics they actually put some thought behind it!
B000021YQV|4.0|In the world of nu-metal, a staid, repetitive genre not known for particularly innovative or intelligent music, System Of A Down stands out. A stew of radical politics, stattaco rhythms, Serj Tankian's Jello Biafra-esque vocals, and angular yet melodic song structures, Toxicity is like Helmet-meets-Dead Kennedys-meets-Mr. Bungle, with a twist of Roots-era Sepultura thrown in.<br /><br />Just when I thought there was a serious lack of innovation in the mainstream, along comes System Of A Down. These guys are without a doubt unique. Although Rage Against The Machine tackled similar political topics, System Of A Down has an entirely different approach. Serj Tankian is possibly one of the most unique frontmen today--he can blend harsh roars, croons, and powerful screams, often in the same song. Daron Malorkian is a respectable guitarist--unlike most nu-metal guitarists, he actually plays RIFFS, not power chords. The rhythm work adds a real Middle Eastern feel to the music (not surprising, since two members of the band are of Armenian descent).<br /><br />Toxicity contains plenty of great songs--the obvious single Chop Suey!, the borderline-thrash of Needles and Deer Dance, the Middle Eastern-inflected Science, and the harrowing title track. Other good tracks are Aerials (the closest thing this album comes to having a ballad), the excellent midtempo Forest, and the rapid Shimmy. The album even ends in a cool little tribal jam.<br /><br />Although this album does suffer from a few mediocre tracks (X doesn't really go anywhere, and Jet Pilot is just strange), Toxicity stands as the band's best work so far, being a bit less \\"goofy\\" and better-written than the debut and less overproduced and more consistent than Steal This Album. Metalheads who can look past the drop-tuning and mainstream acceptance will find that System Of A Down is an excellent band. Recommended.
B0000024Z7|5.0|Perfect background music for.... so many things I probably shouldn't mention here! Anyways, this is definately Santana's best, buy it, download it, somehow aquire it, and enjoy it. And as the other reviews note, if you like the new Santana pop stuff, don't bother with this. It's not even in the same genre.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver<BR>By: Lois Lowry<BR>Reviewed By: Jason Yeh<BR>Per. 2<br />      This book is about a community where Jonas lives and Jonas life. The community was normal and everything was Sameness. They had the annual ceremonies which celebrated the aging of children and selection of new jobs for the Twelves. Jonas spent his volunteer hours as an Eleven at many different places. When the day of Jona's ceremony finally begins, everything goes by slowly until all the Elevens were Twelves and started working. The headperson skipped Jonas number and gave the rest jobs. The citizens figured out and started wondering. The headperson apologizes and tells Jonas that he was going to be given the job as next receiver of memory which was a highly honored job. When his job began, Jonas met the current receiver and became friends with him very quickly.<BR>      The next few weeks, Jonas learned much information from the Giver. He received memories of pleasant things at first, but the Giver knew that it was his job to transfer pain to him.<BR>He transferred light memories of pain and finally transferred a great pain to Jonas, \\"poverty.\\" Jonas lives this life until the day he ran away with a newborn, Gabriel, who was about to be released. With the help of the Giver, Jonas escaped to another community. With few memories, he and Gabriel traveled many miles to try and reach another community. Finally, hey hear some music in the distance and knew they had reached their goal.<BR>      My favorite part of the book was when Jonas received the memories. He was forced to bear with the pain but was relieved with a dose of happiness, love, and warmth. Receiving the memories seemed exciting and unexpecting. He didn't know how much pain he would receive. <BR>      I enjoyed this book because it was very tense and had a good plot line to it. \\"JONAS, JONAS, JONAS, JONAS.\\" This quote explains how the community was accepting the selection of Jonas as the next receiver. Unfortunately, he doesn't last very long. He decides to run away. \\"'He lied to me!' sobbed Jonas\\" This might have been one of the reasons Jonas wanted to run away. Since he was not used to being lied to, Jonas felt angry at his father when he lied to him. Overall, this book was still a wonderful piece of literature.
B00006SFBD|4.0|What is prog rock? This certainly is not. I don't like prog rock, and I like this. I think long tracks, with light/shade, and slow/fast, soft/hard etc. leads people to lazily brand this prog rock/metal. Really, this does not sound like King Crimson at all, or Yes, and Radiohead runs parallel to it. I mean, is Master of Puppets prog metal? No it's not. Opeth is a good metal band, and Deliverance is a good metal album. It's heavy, with distorted riffage, guttural vox and small-spaced, double-kick drumming - signatures of any metal band: but, here, well done. Four stars. Pick it up.
B00006G8G1|5.0|The video and audio quality on this DVD is incredible! Any die-hard Maiden fan that has stuck with them through all of the changes throughout the years will be blown away by the choice of songs. What's great is that if you are a hard-core Dickinson fan and not keen to Blaze Bayley's sound you get to hear Dickinson sing on 2 of Bayley's songs \\"Sign of the Cross\\" and \\"The Clansman\\" which have become 2 of my favorite of all time. The guitars, with the addition of Janick Gers, is incredible. 3 lead guitarists rippin' off blazing solos is a sight to see and hear. You'll want to watch it over and over again!

B000089RVX|5.0|After so many years of badly manufactured punk, pop, rap, and hip-hop, finally there's a band that defines music by creating a new sound and yet having the ability of putting an album with not a single song to skip on the CD player.<br />Evanescence might become THE REAL NEXT BIG THING, after failed attempts by music critic favorites... The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines, and The White Stripes.<br />In these days where rock bands come and go, Evanescence could probably become the first music legend of XXI century.
B0000035E7|5.0|When I first bought this album I didn't really listen to it that much. But after a few listens it got right beneath my skin. By then I had completely fallen in love with it. Why didn't Nirvana release this before the radio friendly Nevermind. If they had, then this would be the best album of the eighties (which it is anyway) Personal favourites of mine: Blew, About a girl, School, Love Buzz, Negative Creep, Scoff, Sifting, Big Cheese, Downer
B000089RVX|3.0|Not that this CD is bad, it's actually quite entertaining, but it seems to be almost a complete rip off of Lacuna Coil. Haunting female vocals, chock full of angst and pain, backed up by the occasional harsh male vocal... I've heard it all before and done better. It you like this album, at least go for the real deal...<br />EDIT:  On second thought, buy this album, but use it as a \\"stepping stone\\" to bands like Lacuna Coil, the Gathering, et al.  Just take a step off that Clear Channel cliff, and go beyond radio!<br />Peace,<BR>Kosmo
B00006RCNW|5.0|I agree with all of the other reviews here at Amazon.com that this is a marvelous series.  Hubby watched it with me and agreed it was brilliant BUT, incredibly, he bailed out on the last two episodes.  He found the series way too violent and didn't want to see any more of it.  There was no way I could stop watching though.  I was absolutely hooked.  The writing here is exceptional.  Plus the editing is the best I've ever seen on TV.  When lesser talents would belabor each point in the plot, drilling it home, this series cuts away and moves on.  Fantastic! The jist of the series is an embattled inner city LA police station and the wars it fights both inside and outside the department.<br /><br />The lead character, Vic, is a dirty cop.  He is on the take and he does some horrific things.  Yet he's awfully good at getting the roughest police jobs done.  You are constantly divided in your feelings about this character.  The other characters are also complex with Vic's chief, David, being the next most complex character.  Wildly ambitious politically, he will do almost anything to get into L.A. political life, yet he too has moments of redemption when he is marveouly effective as the guy in charge.  The only viewers I caution to stay away from this series are those who are upset by a lot of violence.  This series is very violent but it would lose a lot of its power if it weren't.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00001OH7P|5.0|Is this one of the best albums ever, I think so. There is so many classic tracks, must listens such as 'Five years' and 'Rock 'n' Roll Suicide' these songs are are euphoric. Then you've got classics such as 'Starman', 'Ziggy Stardust' and 'Suffragette city' it really doesn't get any better than this! but it isn't an album to skip over either, every song on this is a masterpiece, there isn't any weak tracks. This man is a God, too many great songs to list, buy this album. Hooray for Bowie.
B00008DDXL|4.0|The first movie, #1, had a lot of obstacles to overcome. First, the OVERWHELMING pressure and expectations that were set on it. It, for the most part, past that. It had to introduce hundreds of thousands of people to this wizarding world, and it's hero, Harry Potter, and that took nearly an hour out of its running time. Those were just a few of the many obstacles the Sorcerer's Stone HAD to overcome. <br />Well, in Chamber of Secrets, people now know the story of Harry <BR>Potter, have lowered (a bit) there expectations, and the entire cast and crew is back with a LOT more experience. All of these advantages over #1 should make this a better movie, right?Thankfully, it WAS. Here's what I thought of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: <br />1) Plot: This movie follows the second book in J.K. Rowling's recored-selling book series, and follows Harry throug his second year at Hogwarts. While many have said that this was the worst book of the series, and because of that this might turn out to be the worst movie of the series. I highly disagree! We start out with Harry, back at the Dursleys for the summer...here we go again. They treat him like...a criminal, work him to death, and dont allow him to say the \\"M word\\" (magic) AT ALL IN THIS HOUSEHOLD!!! Well, one night, when Harry is in his room, a house-elf, named Dobby, visits Harry. He warns of GRAVE DANGER at Hogwarts, horrible things planned for the following school year! What is this elf talking about? Harry ignores the elf, and goes to school anyway. Everything seems to be going normally (or whatever you would call \\"normal\\" at Hogwarts) when Harry finds a cat, Mrs. Norris, hanging upside down...petrified in a hallway. And above, written in what looks like blood, are written the words \\"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened.\\" What's going on??? No one knows, and within a few weeks, more people have been petrified by an un-known creature. That's when Harry remembers Dobby's comments, that something terrible would be happening that year at Hogwarts... <br />2) Acting: HUGE improvement. Amazing the difference a year makes...at least for the cast of Harry Potter. There is so much more emotion, drama, suspense. For example, last year, there were perhaps 2 or 3 confrentation with Malfoy the whole movie. In Chamber of Secrets, they really clash! There are wizarding duels, TONS OF QUIDDITCH!, a lot more emphasis on Harry and his friends, etc... Bonds are really made here, and some of the best scenes are when Malfoy's father (a Voldemort supporter) and Ron' s dad (a true wizard) talk... Hermione, Ron, Harry, and the rest of Gryffindor really seem to come together. There is real emotion as well when they defend each other, *example: Malfoy calling Hermione a \\"mudblood\\", everyone from both Gryffindor and Slytherin yelling and trying to get a piece of the other! Hermione's tears after the insult, Ron and Harry's support. The entire school welcoming Hagrid back toward the end, everyone cheering Harry on after the Quidditch game, etc... And the actor who played Gildera Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) did a SUPERB job! He was holarious, loved to show off his teeth and get attention, and really played the clueless part well too! The whole movie had some humor in it as well that was lacked in the first one, and it was little things like Kenneth Branagh's GREAT acting and sense of humor that made this one better than the first. <br />There is a lot more dark acting here too. Voldemort is brought to life in a scary way, and seeing all the petrified people, Harry hearing voices in the wall that NO ONE else can here. Tom Riddle's Hermione like brilliance, all the mystery, suspense, and those spiders...and that snake. All of the acting combining with a suspeneseful story made this a better movie then the last. <br />3) Graphics: Another huge improvement. Hogwarts, while see ming <BR>confined in the first movie, seems to come alive in this. You learn about the whomping willow, go a lot DEEPER into theforbidden forest, and see those....horrible spiders. The snake, the blood, the Quidditch game(s) (brought together a LOT better than in the Sorcerer's stone. A lot more action!). Even the blood and the big fight against Voldemort is all very exciting....thanks to the graphics. You really feel a lot more like your seeing Hogwarts the way J.K. Rowling saw it. It feels real, not like it came off of a computer program. That helped capture the feeling, and continue the magical flame the first one lit!<br />4) Problems: It seems like they often go for ALL of the big things, and don't try to ease you in to regular life at Hogwarts. And while this was a great movie, and nearly flawless in a lot of ways, it still lacked that and could still use something. The main problem right now, in my opinion, is the fact that they go for the BIG things. When I read the books, I felt (feel) like I was attending Hogwarts myself, reading about all of the homework and going to all of the classes and Quidditch practice every night and eating breakfast and discussing tactics with Ron in the morning. They seemed <BR>to have still missed that for the most part here. *(They also left a few things out: Deathday Party for example)*<br />Overall, this is a GREAT movie. It has a lot of action, GREAT <BR>graphics, and superb acting in a lot of ways. It's still not perfect, but I think that by the third movie, \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" (set to be released June 2004 as last reported) we may have a 5-star series ! I'd reccomend this to anyone who even thought the books were okay, and who doesn't have an XTREME fear of Snakes and or Spiders *lol*. <br />Thx!
0805047905|5.0|Like most picture books with a repetitious word pattern in the text, this book is good for teaching English as a second language.  It can be used either for a lesson on colors or a lesson on animals.<br />Furthermore, it is easy to set to music.  When I set the text to a simple melody and ask for volunteers to play that melody on the xylophone, the kids go wild.<br />It is also interesting to use this book alongside 0152007717, which is written on a similar pattern.
B000083C49|3.0|I have to agree with Michael Hardy (Jan 9, 2003).  I absolutely loved this film the first couple of times I saw it, but over the years, I don't think it has worn than well.  Some of the humor has become kind of old.  It was an enjoyable romp, pure entertainment, but not much character development.  I do wish they would have had more scenes between McCoy and Spock; what a great relationship that was.<br />My favorite Trek movies are 2, 3, 4, and 8 (First Contact).  (I couldn't even finish watching Insurrection, that last time I pulled out the tape.)
B00005JLEU|4.0|i originally saw this film in the theatre.  i was amazed by the originality of the storyline and the visuals.  it was so refreshing to be in a non-western mindset for a change.  unfortunately, chihiro opened her mouth and out came \\"lilo's\\" voice.  as i listened more carefully, i suddenly heard \\"meg\\" on loan from hercules.  from this moment on in viewing the film, i became apprehensive; i kept waiting for a musical number.  don't get me wrong.  disney has made some of the most amazing musicals ever, in my opinion.  in the age of ashman/menken, they really knew what they were doing.  but watching 'spirited away' in the disney-dub version seemed wrong somehow, and musical numbers, which would be very ill-fitting to the style and magic of this particular film, could be felt lurking in the shadows though thankfully they never emerged.<br />i think that miyazaki's work could be much more appreciated with subtitles.  there is a poetry to the japanese language that, while at times a bit 'fluffy' to read in subtitles, is much easier to take when read as opposed to hearing it spoken in an american accent.  (i wish i could explain this more clearly, but that's as close as i can get to it...sigh). ...<br />that said, endure the american disney dub and allow the magic of spirited away to take you to places in animated movie-making that you may not have known existed.  it's delightful, intelligent, beautiful, and clearly made to be enjoyed by everyone in the audience as a MOVIE, which is why you won't see chihiro or any of her friends in a happy meal or at target--though i'm sure the disney store is already trying to work out a deal to take care of this.  sigh.
0316666343|1.0|In addition to the comments my co-readers have already made, I'd like to point out that the book takes place in an unmemorable suburb of a nameless (?) town in ???Ohio? Illinois? Idaho? wherever it is, it's completely devoid of any identifying details. Similarly, what era is the story supposed to take place in? Is it the 50s? 70s? 90s? By trying to be universal, it ends up being nowhere. <BR>There's a gauzy wishful curtain over the whole book, with the repentant mom redeemed by her husband's brush with death...For a contrast, read \\"The Corrections,\\" which is vivid and clean and unsentimental, and seems real.
B00005JLSE|2.0|This review is not for people who like musicals.  If you do like musicals, then Chicago is a dream come true.  Under Rob Marshall's direction, Chicago manages to achieve the same kind of visceral impact as a live Broadway show, and that is an amazing accomplishment.  The choreography is excellent, the performances are solid, and you're certain to be entertained for a solid two hours...<br />...if you like musicals.<br />If you do NOT like musicals (that would be 98% of the heterosexual male population, not that there's anything wrong with it), then do NOT see Chicago.  I don't care if someone forces you to see it - tell them it's for their sake that you don't want to go.  They don't want to sit next to someone rolling their eyes and checking their watch every five minutes, so let them know that.<br />I've always found the musical to be a fundamentally flawed form.  It's always been an invitation for performers to overact and dance around like spastik children.  Musicals also are an excuse for threadbare plots and cliched writing.  They also always inevitably, and painfully, encourage a veritable orgy of Jazz Hands.  And when they're over, their usually chorusless songs rattle around in your head for a solid year, especially when those songs breathlessly shout out single words in an attempt to sound sexy (\\"Squish!  Cicero!  Lipschitz!\\").  Horrifying, indeed.  And Chicago, despite being an all-around excellent musical, doesn't do anything to discourage those stereotypes.  It garnered tons of acting accolades (most notably Catherine Zeta-Jones' Oscar), but no one here is really acting, they're performing.  All you need to know is how many actors were considered for these roles to know it's not exactly a stretch to play these characters.  They're broad, to say the least.<br />Again, if musicals are your thing, then Chicago will probably be your favorite movie of the year.  But musicals are like cats.  If you like them, you adore them.  If you do not like them, you wouldrather be dragged across a field of thumbtacks than be anywhere near one.  If you are in the latter category, and you can tell by now that I am, then don't go see Chicago.  Nothing about it will convince you otherwise.
B00008H2LE|5.0|What an absolutely beautiful album! Dark, moody but with an edge. I would not give you a break down of each and every track. That only works for pop confections, when each and every track is made by different writers and producers for a single artist. &quot;Meteora&quot; however is an epic organic whole with Linkin Park residing in its soul. Finally, something worth keeping the CD for 5 years and the DVD is awesome too! Meteora... simply astounding!
0385504209|5.0|Mr. Brown has written one of the most engaging historical fiction books I have read as of yet. Simply put, it was so engrossing that I had to tear myself away from it.<br />The bottom line is that after reading the first half of the book in one sitting, I went out and purchased all of his works to date (Digital Fortress, Deception Point, and Angels & Demons) and cannot wait to see what he comes up with next.

B000002BYD|5.0|I own all of the Pearl Jam albums and most of the singles and this is my favorite entire album Pearl Jam has ever released. Don't get me wrong, some of the songs on Ten and Vs. are better songs, but as an overall album, the songs just keep coming on Yield like no other. It's their only album I can listen to straight through. &quot;Given to Fly&quot; was the first song of Pearl Jam's I really loved, and &quot;MFC,&quot; &quot;Wishlist,&quot; and &quot;Low Light&quot; are also personal favorites. As an aside, the packaging of this album in pretty sweet. You can't go wrong with this one!
B00008977N|1.0|What a letfdown. Gabriel should be ashamed of himself for letting this get released. I have videos from the 1960s that have video quality twice as good as this. I thought my copy was defective until I read the other reviews. Try again guys....
0375707972|5.0|I loved this book. I urge you to read it. It lingers in the mind for weeks after reading it.  There is something so sweet and hopeful and tragic about Michael. This is a great book!

B000002H72|5.0|This was the Pixies at the top of their form. They had graduated past the self-conscious amateurism of &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; but hadn't yet turned into the pros who put out &quot;Bossanova&quot;, and the result is an album bursting with confidence and invention. You hear a lot of lip service these days (quite rightly) about the distortion and screaming featured so often on Pixies songs, but what you seldom hear about is the groove. Each song on this album is anchored by a simple, melodic groove. Listen to the extended coda of &quot;Number 13 Baby&quot; and you hear a band stretching out because it had recently acquired the skill to do it. That is a golden moment in the short life of a rock and roll band. &quot;Doolittle&quot; is that moment for the Pixies.
B00005OM4K|5.0|This collection is worth the price for a CCR fan.  I don't know how the sound quality compares with the remastered cd's, but if you bought all the original Fantasy cd's, you will find that the sound quality in this set is superior.  You get the entire Creedence catalog, including Blue Velvets and Golliwogs recordings, an interesting chronicle of the development of a great band.  In addition to the studio work, you get the live recordings, some of which were not available on the live 'Concert' cd.  If you want all CCR's stuff in one nice package, this is the set to get.
B000002UJQ|3.0|So let me get this straight. A bunch of one-hit-wonder grunge copyists (\\"Pablo Honey\\") bottom out after flitting over to overly-precious Britpop (\\"The Bends\\"), and then decide that song structure is what's holding them back. The melodies and words on \\"OK Computer\\" sound like Thom Yorke is making them up as he sings them. The thematic conceit is [bad]. The music - while not wholly unlikeable - trades bombast for pretension. And some people find this challenging and out-there? It's avant-garde for people who've never heard anything avant-garde - much closer to the meandering, tuneless, self-important prog noodling that made punk rock necessary.<br />Unfortunately - though predictably - this psuedo-intellectual, gussied-up Britpop approach to experimentalism proved safe enough that \\"OK Computer\\" tapped into the zeitgeist. In other words, it's just out there enough to give a conservative mainstream audience a fleeting sense of being hip. Now, all of you, get back in your cages.
6305922756|4.0|Hesitate no further, this is a must-have DVD! You get all the info you could want about the Loudest Band, including loads of outtakes you wish could have made the movie. I deduct one star because they didn't include the commentary with the director and actors from the Criterion DVD, which is no longer in print, and very hard to get for the new fan who didn't have the foresight to buy it when it was available. This is one of the funniest movies ever made, with satisfying extras, and needs to be in your collection!
B000066F6H|3.0|There's an intelligence and sense of humor at work in the Hives that makes even their most generic moments stand out above the garage punk pack. Unfortunately, there's a LOT of generic moments,  and even the charismatic crack in Pelle Almqvist's voice can't mask the sense of been-there-done-that. Still, the band somehow emits the aura of worldbeaters, and \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" offers a hint that the Hives may have a few more surprises up their collective sleeves.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I just got this SACD version today and my mind was blown. I have a decent sound system with 5 full range speakers (Interlude 40, 25c, 10), JBL PB10 subwoofer, Yamaha receiver, Sony SACD player, and I use really good cables and speaker wire. I previously had the MFSL gold version of this cd and the SACD version just kills it in every possible way.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence has quite a work of art here. This Is quite possibly the best CD I have ever heard.  I havent stopped listening to it since I bought it.  Amy Lee has the most amazing voice I have ever heard, and it is quite apparent on songs like &quot;My Immortal&quot;.  Their variety of songs is what makes this album so great.  You go from a simple piano, violin and Amy Lee in &quot;my immortal&quot; to a chilling, spooky song called &quot;Haunted&quot;.  Best CD I have ever bought.  You will not be disappointed.
B000089RVX|5.0|To start to try to describe this cd is extremely hard.  I don't think I have ever heard a combination of amazing female vocals and guitar licks ever.  This whole cd is amazing!  When I purchased it I listened to it for 4 days straight.  Amy Lee's vocals are unbelievable!  The guitar licks are amazing!  It is nothing short of spectacular!  I would highly recommend this cd for anybody who enjoys great music!
B000002JS6|5.0|I have this on tape it contains 5-7 of the tracks Ive seen on all greatest hits comps.  Personally I like AC/DC because of the screamin' (literally) rock music.  This album is great, I've heard people complain that its too juvenile, too much about sex & drugs well some of AC/DC's music was like that before this album anyhow...so I give it five stars.
B000068TSI|5.0|This movie is heavy on special effects--about getting shot!!  At first I thought, \\"this is very accurate, but needs some more gunsmoke.\\"  That happened pretty soon, too.  This is the Infantry at its bloodiest and noisiest--how anyone can keep their wits about them as portrayed effectively here is still beyond me to this day.  I was a Huey driver, like Major Crandall in this movie, and I was glad to fly for these guys, and also fly away, too!<br />The movie is not as well constructed as Joey Galloway's book, but, truly, that is another story to read before seeing this film.  Hal Moore's personality is sincerely conveyed, and the Fort Benning of that time comes across.  There are great portrayals of the stoic Army wives waiting that are for real; it is too bad that this era was such a tough time for all. I hope that Joey's and the General's wishes that more civilians understand the true story of the Vietnam vet continues to get accomplished. The North Vietnamese regulars are treated respectfully for their courage and audacity, also. They were a superior enemy.<br />This is a video that should be on any veteran's shelf, ...
B00008977N|3.0|Let me not waste too much of your time:  Frankly, this is, hands down, the most amazing concert I have seen!  This DVD offers a glimpse of why Peter Gabriel has a superb reputation as a live performer.  The sound quality is spectacular!  Unfortunately, I am SURE that Peter Gabriel had next to nothing to do with the planning for this Laser Disc converstion to DVD format.  The picture quality is mediocre at best, due to the grainey picture quality.  Peter Gabriel is one of the greatest showmen ever, and I am sure when you see this DVD that you will be in full agreement with me when I say that Peter Gabriel was violated by his video production company.  An improved picture quality could make this the best concert DVD in publication.  Still, this is a nice DVD to own if you've missed Peter Gabriel's shows.  Just don't expect much from this DVD as an example of year 2003's DVD picture quality capabilities.....Sorry!
B00008H2LE|5.0|This has to be one of the best cd's i've ever heard. That's all i can say about it.
B0000524CY|5.0|It is simply amazing to me how well this film has held up over the years. For my money, it is still one of the most effective movies ever made. It is intense, serious, thought provoking, and hypnotic all at once. I saw this film when it was released. Some friends and I snuck into a drive-in (we were all under-age) and hid in the back in the bushes near an open speaker. It kept us all quiet, tense and staring out of the darkness at the screen, struggling to hear the faint crackling of the nearby speaker. All these years later, I bought the DVD, and it is the movie I remember, and then some.<br />In this age of computer, whiz-bang effects, this is still the top of the horror genre with no close competition, but it is far more than a genre. It has something that seems forgotten today - a great story, great writing, and great film editing. There are certain scenes of exorcism, with Max Von Sydow and the great, nearly forgotten Jason Miller, which are the most powerful in screen history. Only the \\"russian roulette\\" scene in Deer Hunter comes to mind as a comparison.<br />Lee J. Cobb (another great actor that is slipping from public memory) is memorable as Lieutenant Kinderman, and Ellen Burstyn seems to be living the movie more than acting within it.<br />So much has changed since this film was made - so many advances in the technology of filmmaking and even ways that we view or think of a movie. I think the primary secret of this film is the almost somber, deadly way it takes itself completely seriously. There is no comic relief in this picture, and no romantic interest. A human soul is possessed by the Devil. Only the Will of God can save her, a faith displayed by his representatives on earth.<br />Riveting and satisfying.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Its about time russia had so pop talent. These Two Younge girls are just the perfect duo. The two have amazing voices. Good good music.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Get this DVD if you are Talking Heads fan!  Pretty silly interview with David Byrne that is rather funny.
B0000067X1|5.0|Back in the days of LPs, _Tago Mago_ was a big double album. The common criticism levied against artists and their double albums is that such lengthy, ambitious projects were usually sullied with &quot;filler&quot;; ambition that overreached its bounds -- like not enough butter spread across too much bread... _Tago Mago_ deserves no such reproach. There is nary a dull second on this 73 minute CD. Nothing seems superfluous or out of place, which is especially impressive when you think of how experimental and &quot;weird&quot; this was back when it was originally released (which was 1971).<br />Can was among the original trinity of mighty krautrock artists, together with Neu! and Faust. This music should not be approached with any expectations -- experimental weirdness is what it's all about. Rock is the musical foundation, but it is obfuscated with such sonic experimentation that it often makes the rock element unrecognizable. Technology is applied thoroughly to create unusual textures and electronic sounds, with tape loops and synthesizers also contributing to the drone-like thematic developments. Pre-recorded sounds are looped, spliced together, and altered with increased or dragged speeds for weird sonic effects. This was a feature of modern composition that had appeared many decades ago before 1971, but it was the marvel of krautrock that brought such concepts to the basic rock band.<br />Side 1 is surely the most song-oriented, although it has a way to go before drawing near a conventional idea of accessibility. &quot;Paperhouse&quot; thunders along a throbbing beat and jangling guitar jamming. &quot;Mushroom&quot; and &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; are pretty similar, the former a droning reverie in black &amp; white with a repetitive shout for vocals, the latter ending with some terrific guitar jamming.<br />The rest of the album is weirder but strangely approachable (but I'm drawn to odd things). &quot;Halleluwah&quot; deceptively begins with an infectious groove but this melts in and out of a krautrock freakout, although it remains allegiant to its primary theme. &quot;Augmn&quot; is a 17-minute collage of haunting sounds, floating around randomly in stereo, culminating with a phenomenal minimalist percussion jam at the end. Throughout, vocalist Damo Suzuki jabbers haphazardly without direction, making the music less accessible and hungry. &quot;Bring Me Coffee or Tea&quot; has a somewhat apathetic vocal from Suzuki, with a smoky, exotic atmosphere laid out by guitars and synthesizers and gradually fractured by the tense, unsettling drums.<br />_Tago Mago_ is ESSENTIAL krautrock heaven for anyone who appreciates experimental music. Pick this one up along with Neu!'s self-titled release and Faust's _Faust/So Far_ (that one's a reissue of two albums on one CD). With those three discs you will have some of the best experimental rock ever made in your collection, all influential and great. ADD TO CART!

B000063UR1|4.0|There's a strong political/ecological message in this film but I enjoy it for its science fiction screenplay. With many of the films of the time (\\"Soylent Green\\", \\"The Omega Man\\", etc) there was strong social commentary and apocalyptic themes. While ecology is important to us all, in this film, it's a bit too strong in parts (though it doesn't overwhelm the entire script).<br />With that, there's a bit of a mixed message presented by the film, regarding the forest domes and the ill-fated crewmen of the film's main character, Freeman Lowell. Bruce Dern is perfect as Lowell who disobeys orders but at the cost of his own integrity. There's some shocking heavy-handedness to his otherwise benevolent character. You'll have to see the film for yourself and draw your own conclusions.<br />But enough of that. As science fiction, this is simply a great film. Excellent special effects (for its time) and sets. I liked the spaceships; they seemed very practical and functional. Without giving away too much of the plot, one must wonder why such extreme measures are taken with the cargo when it seems it could have been \\"parked\\" somewhere. When you watch the film, you'll understand what I mean. But of course, there'd be no story without the extreme measures.<br />Oddly touching and indeed brilliant ahead of their time, are the three robots that accompany Freeman. The robots are apparently equipped to have emotions as they experience grief, concern and loneliness. They even cheat at cards, while playing Poker with Freeman. Two of the robots have a tété-a-tété outside on the surface of the spacecraft where they share their concerns about Lowell and the cargo. By the end of the film, I was surprised to discover how much the robots themselves had touched me. I don't know how they manipulated them but they each took on real personalities. Freeman even takes the little robots out for their own personal \\"Arbor Day\\". It's actually done very well and the robots really make you believe it. There's a little bewilderment and disbelief on the part of the robots when their first tree-planting doesn't go smoothly and Freeman chastises them for their lack of understanding ... neat ...<br />This film has stood the test of time. The cinematography is well-done and has been preserved in near pristine shape. The film looks every bit as new as when it was produced (some colorization in the special effects was characteristic of the studio technology available at that time and does not represent degradation of the master reels as such).<br />There really was never a film quite like \\"Silent Running\\" and I dare say it could not be duplicated nor equaled. This is not the action fare of \\"Star Wars\\" but it's a little faster paced than \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and the subject matter is a little less complex and mysterious (let me say \\"2001\\" was brilliant on several levels for the most part).<br />I even like the robot that plays pool with the guys. This is a science fiction classic, if you liked the 1970's, and a \\"must have\\" for your collection. With regard to the DVD, you get chapter access and nothing else. No production notes, no theatrical trailer, no language / subtitle options, but the film is worthy of digital processing, so buy the DVD if you can for that reason, just don't be surprised by the lack of features.
B0000025FG|4.0|I accept that this is a 'light' ELO album. But that makes this album very special. It is like &quot;Love You&quot; of Beach Boys. It's not serious, but yet, you cannot get away from its pretty charm.<BR>Actually, not one song in Discovery is a filler. Every song has very tuneful melody, which you must whistle within 1 or 2 hearing. <BR>Shine a light is a great song. Midnight blue was a huge hit in many countries other than US. Don't bring me down, Need her love, Confusion, all the songs here are my favorites from my early teenage days. Even after I listened to Eldorado and Out of the Blue, Discovery remains as my personal favorite in ELO's discography.
B00008AOWA|3.0|The problem with this film is that it's too short. The story starts at the wrong place, at exactly when Lecter is discovered and captured, purely by accident by Norton who is consulting him for advice on the murders.<BR>Is it just me or are we unaware exactly WHAT Lecter did? Unless you read the books or look at the commentary then you don't know. It would've been nice if a half an hour or forty five minutes was given to Lecter's crimes and victims so that we would get a feelign of how evil he's supposedly.<BR>Without that the other killers in this and subsequent films seem gruesomer than the master. It would be nice to see WHY these killers idolize him so much.<BR>Ralph Finnes is good here but has very little to work with as we know he's going to be caught, there's no build-up to what makes one nut love another to the point of them working together to kill their rivals enemies and their families.<BR>Ed Norton is as always sensational in a wearied performance as a man who's seen too much but still cares. Unfortunately the fact that we don't know what he's seen is the problem.<BR>Emily Watson, one of my favorite actresses is ok as the blind woman who is forward with Finnes, thinking he's simply repressed and shy and not the whackjob he turns into. I have a theory about the Hannibal series which I detail in the other reviewes, making this movie important as part of teh triology watched as a whole but not as a stand alone film.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Different than the first album. More bland, more ... dj crap that makes it sound very fake, and less catchy than the first. If you liked Hybrid Theory, you might not like this one. If you liked the first single, nevertheless, you will like the album. However, if you did not and expected the album to be different than the single, you will be disappointed, as the album is full of the same riffs, played over and over. The album seems to have been made with little emotion, and the turntables are annoying throughout. Maybe one or two good songs, the rest is very average. Do check it out though, because the way music is going today, average is very good.
B00006690G|5.0|WOW. Of his 3 albums, I'd say that Eminem has really hit the mark w/ 'The Eminem Show.' 'The Slim Shady LP,' albeit successful, was still his first go. 'The Marshall Mathers LP' was good, but a little dark. Eminem has really hit full stride w/ 'The Eminem Show.'<BR>I bought this album the day it came out last year, and I was not disappointed. I'm still listening to it regularly.<BR>His first single, 'Without Me,' grew a bit tiresome after much overplay on the radio, but is still a favorite now, having not heard it as much recently...
B000088E6D|5.0|After reading all the raves about this talented young singer, I rushed out to add his self-titled debut CD to my ever-growing library of great singers (old and new).  <br />Thanks to the fantastic production of David Foster and the mentoring of Paul Anka, this is a fine debut outing. From the opening scorcher \\"Fever\\" to the closing ballad \\"That's All,\\" Michael shows that he's got a great future on his hands (and of course, with his incredible voice). The backup band's a knockout, also!<br />In an era where we have so-called superstars whose main premise is to make megabucks singing mindless trash, we have a up-and-coming vocal stylist who has put his personal stamp on not only the great old standards, but also some great rock-era classics. Can't wait for the next one!
0792845668|5.0|I'm afraid I'll have to say I like the sequel even better than the original \\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\\". The original was a lot of fun and brought a fresh script. Obviously some of those things are going to be repeated in the sequel for the sake of continuity, but I like the screenplay on the sequel even better (don't get me wrong, the first film is great!) ...<br />Briefly, Chuck D. Nomulus is back with a vengeance and plotting to overthrow the Utopian society constructed around the philosphies and music of (who else?) Bill & Ted. Chuck's evil(!) plan includes two robot Bill & Ted's designed to supplant the real guys and cancel out the past (kinda like SkyNet tried in \\"Terminator\\") ... will Chuck succeed in his evil plan? ... you'll have to buy the movie to find out ...<br />There's some classic footage from the Star Trek episode \\"Arena\\" and I think the boys even visit the same rock formation where it was filmed (a little homage?) ... A Martian named \\"Station\\" helps the boys with their own little science experiment which provides a little action reminiscent of \\"Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots\\" (for those of you who grew up in 1970's and had the game) ...<br />Pam Grier is absolutely beautiful in this film ... she lets the boys enter the local band contest ... and there are a few surprises in store. The soundtrack is fun and the language is generally acceptable for family viewing and overall a PG-13 rating is about right. <br />George Carlin is back as Rufus and Missy is back, too, though she proves to be a bit fickle. There's a little bit of theology in the film which is not exactly Biblical, but yet it's poignant in its own way in a few spots. And Bill & Ted experience a few revelations themselves. Oh, well ... it's a movie!!!<br />Hats off to William Sadler, playing two roles in the move (one major and one minor) ... absolutely hilarious and creative ... I could not have been more amazed to discover Sadler playing the part of Death. Bill & Ted challenge him to agame of Twister, Clue and Battleship, among others, for all the marbles. Sadler steals every single scene he's in and he deserves it.<br />The special effects are great and a hoot to watch. With the DVD version, you get the teaser and theatrical trailers (though there's apparently not much difference in them), a behind-the-scenes featurette, and subtitles / spoken languages of English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. If you've conquered many of the romantic Latin-based languages, you'll have a heyday.<br />This is one film I've enjoyed watching over and over again which is why I gave it 5 stars. It's fun every time I watch it and I pick up a few things, like the birthday card given to one of their girlfriends celebrating her 521st birthday (they were from the past you know!) ... the van scene with Station doing a bit of engineering, and Death pointing out how helpful he's been is just great ... <br />If you haven't seen the first film, \\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\\", then you must get it and watch it first. Then you'll be able to appreciate the inside jokes and plot twists of \\"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey\\" completely, as it was meant to be. Have fun and be excellent to one another, dudes!
B000005JA8|1.0|the experience of listening to this album is akin to having to crouch sober for 4 hours in a sewer with very stoned overprivileged 16 yr. olds thinking that they are saying very profound things.<br />the only use this album could ever have in the music world is as a warehouse of samples.<br />don't let it get you down.
B00004XPPB|5.0|This is a beautiful transfer, on an excellent mob film. The DVD package is VERY good espcially for the below 15 dollar price most retailers have it at. Deleted scenes, directors commmentary, and other special features are done very well, but the movie is classic. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino play off eachother so well, that they make this true story into a cinema masterpiece. I give it the fifth star, because of the &quot;bargain bin&quot; price its been giving, if you see it for 15 bucks consider yourself lucky.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game<BR>By: Orson Scott Card<BR>Reviewed by: R. Itchon<BR>p. 3<br /> Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is sent away at six-years old and has to go to battle school. He is sent away with other young kids that are very brilliant at such a young age.<BR>Ender does not know what to do and he is by himself. Ender has to learn different battle skills and fight in many real-life simulations in battle situations with the Martians. As he grows up, he will both get smarter and have to go through hardships but yet succeed in all that he does.<BR> I like how the book is so futuristic. In all their battle simulations the Martians are just like they are in real battles. They could feel there texture. You could tell how futuristic this book is by the way that the commander always says, \\"Take the transporter to the Martian's planet.\\" That is what I liked about this book.<BR> I also disliked some of the book. I disliked how all the cadets and commanders gave no respect Ender and treat him unfairly. Even in the book it says, \\"Ender was succeeding in all the simulations, but still kept him on a low level and never promoted him to a higher level.\\" Nobody gave Ender any respect and nobody was friendly with him because he was better than all of them.<BR> There is a part in Ender's Game that I liked the most though. My favorite part in this book is when they are going to embrace in battle with the Martians but have a little bit of time to train. When they are in one of there simulations they have to attack the queen just like in real battle and Ender succeeds and at the end he finds out that it was the real war and that Ender just won the battle for the earth against the Martians. This is my favorite part because he always tried his hardest in all of  the simulations and it finally paid off by him winning the war for them.
B00008H2LB|5.0|AMAZING!!<BR>   this CD blew me away.  If you liked Hybrid Theory and you liked Reanimation then you'll love this CD.  It's like the LP crew took the best elements of Hybrid theory and the best elements of Reanimation and made them better - plus adding some new color that shows Linkin Park still has the creativity to survive in the fast-paced world of music.  Definitely worth a buy.  Don't have your friend burn Meteora for you, don't steal the tracks from the internet.  Linkin Park deserves the dinero for this baby.  An EXCELLENT CD.  My favorite track, personally, is track 7 - \\"Faint\\".<BR>BETTER THAN HYBRID THEORY?<BR>   Hmmm... hard to say.  Hybrid Theory was just an amazing CD with stuff no one had ever heard before.  I mean, of course there was Limp Bizkit, but although I'm a Bizkit fan let's admit that they don't have half the talent of Linkin Park.  I'd say Meteora definitely lives up to Hybrid Theory, adding great new elements (\\"Breaking the Habit\\" is a fine example of them showing some variety).  But better than Hybrid Theory?  Not sure.  They're both must-haves. Let's leave it at that.<BR>DOWNSIDES?<BR>   short.  quite a short album (37 minutes).  Another downside is that there are a few songs which sound all-too-similar to the familiar tracks on Hybrid Theory (\\"Numb\\" sounds like \\"Pushing Me Away\\", \\"Easier To Run\\" sounds like \\"Crawling\\", etc).  Not to say these new songs aren't good, because they're great, but if you didn't like Hybrid Theory at all then it's safe to say you won't like this.<br />~NAF GNIRPSFFO
6305546789|5.0|\\"Halloween\\" is by far the scariest movie out there hands down! It doesn't matter how many times I've watched this film, Michael Myers still gives me chills!<br />The movie centers around Laurie Strode, a teenager, and her friends who are babysitting on Halloween night. Soon the news gets out that Michael Myers, the infamous child who killed his parents 16 years prior, has escaped from his mental hospital and is on the loose. Little does Laurie know that Michael is hunting her.<br />Donald Pleasence plays the role of Michael's former doctor, Dr. Loomis perfectly, and Jamie Lee Curtis did a wonderful job of playing the virginal Laurie in her first major feature role.<br />This is definitely a movie to watch with the lights on and with another person sitting there next to you, but \\"Halloween\\" is one of the best horror films ever made. I highly recommend this horror classic!!!!
B00000JPYD|5.0|Debuting on 4/20, April 20, 1974, this album caught the attention of a musical audience that had been waiting for a guitar great since Hendrix passed.  Neil Young hadn't had a commercial hit in a bit and despite the lack of a single, this album climbed right into the Top 10 on the charts.  To this day, I'm still surprised that more people haven't heard of Robin Trower; the band and the man.  Let's not forget the keeper of the beat, Reg Isidore, or the loping bass lines and smooth, soulful vocals of James Dewar--rest in peace, brother.  Each man more than holds his own on this album, playing off one another and complementing each other perfectly.  &quot;Day of the Eagle&quot; is a great way to kick off the album, starting as a straight-on rocker with a smooth segue into a bluesy riff to run out the song.  The title track, &quot;Bridge of Sighs,&quot; is the perfect highway song.  Not to knock Blackfoot's &quot;Highway Song,&quot; I love it, but I'm higher than a kite when &quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot; slides out of my speakers in the middle of the night on a long drive to nowhere.  &quot;In This Place&quot; maintains the slow vibe and sets you up like a bowling pin for &quot;The Fool and Me&quot; to knock right down and out.  Setting the mood and turning the lights down for you is &quot;About to Begin,&quot; one of the most beautiful and elegant pieces of music I've ever heard.  I'm disappointed each time it comes to a close; far too soon, in my opinion.  &quot;Lady Love&quot; and &quot;Little Bit of Sympathy&quot; wrap up the original album tracks and they're both great examples of Trower's ability to complement and motivate Isidore and Dewar--picked up from his days with Procol Harum, no doubt--while also leaving plenty of time and space for Trower to show off his prowess.  Despite the inevitable comparisons between Robin Trower and Jimi Hendrix, Trower was coming from a more blues-oriented background and tapped into that with much more frequency than the latter.  The bonus tracks are a nice addition, but as has been mentioned before, not a necessary one.  The band doesn't really build off what was already accomplished in the studio, but it's still a treat to listen to.  To wrap this up, if my house explodes into flames tonight, I'm grabbing this album before my family.
0783227019|3.0|I found this movie to be dull during parts. I love Pacino, and I'm a Puerto Rican, but this movie really didn't do much for me. I loved the character &quot;pachanga&quot; and  the hyperactive, coked up Sean penn was excellent in this film. But Pacino, was very low key. (except for the infamous &quot;here comes the pain&quot;) And Penelope Ann Miller was EXTREMELY dull, she brought the movie down. The ending is not a cliched at least. And Pacinos slow, droning voice in the narration is excellent.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game<BR>By: Orson Scott Card<BR>Reviewed by: R. Itchon<BR>p. 3<br /> Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is sent away at six-years old and has to go to battle school. He is sent away with other young kids that are very brilliant at such a young age.<BR>Ender does not know what to do and he is by himself. Ender has to learn different battle skills and fight in many real-life simulations in battle situations with the Martians. As he grows up, he will both get smarter and have to go through hardships but yet succeed in all that he does.<BR> I like how the book is so futuristic. In all their battle simulations the Martians are just like they are in real battles. They could feel there texture. You could tell how futuristic this book is by the way that the commander always says, \\"Take the transporter to the Martian's planet.\\" That is what I liked about this book.<BR> I also disliked some of the book. I disliked how all the cadets and commanders gave no respect Ender and treat him unfairly. Even in the book it says, \\"Ender was succeeding in all the simulations, but still kept him on a low level and never promoted him to a higher level.\\" Nobody gave Ender any respect and nobody was friendly with him because he was better than all of them.<BR> There is a part in Ender's Game that I liked the most though. My favorite part in this book is when they are going to embrace in battle with the Martians but have a little bit of time to train. When they are in one of there simulations they have to attack the queen just like in real battle and Ender succeeds and at the end he finds out that it was the real war and that Ender just won the battle for the earth against the Martians. This is my favorite part because he always tried his hardest in all of  the simulations and it finally paid off by him winning the war for them.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Meteora is excellent. The songs are very good and flow right into each other, making it very enjoyable to listen to the whole album right through. The songs may sound different from what Linkin Park has originally played, but you will get used to it and will love it after listening to it for a couple of times. Somewhere I Belong is an amazing song, and so are Lying From You,  Faint, and Nobody's Listening. I highly recommend buying this CD if you like Linkin Park and even if you don't. This is the best Linkin Park album yet.
B00001W9G0|4.0|\\"The Way We Were\\" is one of those wonderful love stories that you watch and instantly get drawn into the film and the characters. I think that Barbara Streisand and Robert Redford did excellent jobs playing two people who fall desperately in love with each other in time where circumstance and political agendas ultimately tore their love apart. This is one of the few love stories where I was okay and understanding of the couple not living happily ever after. Although they were no longer together, you could tell that Steisand's and Redford's characters still shared a lot of love.<br />I think this is an excellent movie that everyone should watch! I highly recommend it!
0812550757|5.0|After reading Ender's Game, I was sure that the sequel could not live up to the standard that it set.  However, Speaker for the Dead is every bit as good as Ender's Game, if a completely different story.<br />Card does a great job of creating an entirely new species and describing its behavior and customs as well as defining an interesting human culture on the outpost world of Lusitania.  The interaction between these two is fascinating and an interesting contrast with the story of first contact with an alien species told in Ender's Game.<br />I would highly recommend this book.
0783225970|3.0|This movie is one of the best movies I ever watched. But the quality of the DVD as discussed in the reviews, is poor. I'm awaiting a re-release, but I'm not selling my used copy until universal puts it out. If you haven't seen this movie, find a way to, borrow your friend's copy. And Don't Point your fingers at the bad guy!
B00008H2LE|4.0|Where do I begin? Meteora is the result of three years of blood, sweat and tears. Their sophmore album brings a solid sound distinct to Linkin Park that has garnered them fans very quickly.<BR>I think this album is a little bit more experimental. Don't get me wrong, they definately have the rock/hip hop thing going on, but they push the envelope a little further without losing themselves.  But why four stars instead of five?  Well it's too darned short!!!  37minutes just starts to get me going and when it's done, I feel unsatisfied.<br /><BR>And now what everyone likes to read;<BR>A breakdown of the songs:<br />Don't Stay - Personally, I find this one to sounds the most like something from \\"Hybrid Theory\\". Angsty, wrenching, and unforgiving.<br />Somewhere I Belong - The first released single. I really like the guitars in this one, they just sound \\"big\\" if that makes sense. For example, whenever I hear this song I want to take a really deep breath, close my eyes, and just let it wash over me.<br />Lying From You - Here the blending of rock and hip hop is almost seamless and the flexibility of Chester's voice is amazing.<br />Hit the Floor - Here is there first apparent trek into new areas. For me, this was the hardest to really get into because, unlike Lying From You, the hip hop and rock elements are further disparate. But it's has a chorus that's excellent for head bangin.<br />Easier to Run - This has really good lyrics, genuine and easy to empathize with. Self reflective and it has that \\"big\\" feeling like Somewhere I Belong.<br />Faint - I love this song the best (for now at least). Strings, excellent guitars, complex drums, all with a breakbeat feel. Doesn't that sound tempting?<br />Figure.09 - This is my least favorite. Still good! But nothing really more to say about it than that. Maybe because it sounds the most rock influenced and I'm more into their hip hop side.<br />Breaking the Habit - I like the pace of this song. It could have easily been slower butit just works. Joe Hahns influence is apparent in this one in the little details. I also think it has a great message.<br />From the Inside - I think this shows Chester's range off the best. He goes from smooth melodies in the chorus, to pushing his voice in the chorus, to screaming that *actually hits notes*.<br />Nobody's Listening - Definately is the most \\"hip hop\\" like. The Japanese flutes are a great use of sampling. Fun lyrics that talk a lil bit a smack.<br />Session - Mister Hahn takes the stage with this one. But more correctly, it's a song that doesn't have Mike or Chester singing. It's all the guys that people don't know the names of =) (Rob, Brad, and Phoenix) nicely mixed in with some classical music.<br />Numb - In this song, Chester sounds the least like \\"Chester\\". He still has the amazing voice but to me, his voice in the verses just sound different. He brings it back in the chorus but it almost sounds like two different people. It might be just me, but I find it interesting nonetheless.<br />I got the DVD version, which is worth it to the Linkin Park \\"fan\\" because it gives some insight into the making of Meteora (especially where the name comes from) and you get to see the members just be themselves.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|Fun, frothy stuff from more girls with a bunch of guys putting words in their mouths and beats behind them.  Not really a new concept, is it?<br />&quot;All the Things She Said&quot; works fine and locked itself in my head for days, but then so did &quot;The Sign&quot; by Ace of Base when it came out.  The whole of the disc is fine and has plenty of electronic samples and sterile echo tricks to amuse one, and the Russian versions of the tracks are nice little surprises.<br />Though I would be delighted to see Tatu grow as artists, I cannot help but think they are the Chumbawumba of 2003.
B00005JL2O|3.0|I have always liked the Austin Powers movies, but this one, while still very funny, just did not leave me clutching my stomach from laughter pains. Don't get me wrong, this film is very funny at times and Mike Myers did an excellent job, but the addition of Beyonce Knowles and the gratuitous cameos made me think, &quot;Why are they doing that?&quot;<br />I still think that people should check out this film and judge it for themselves. It has it's moments where you're doubled over with laughter, but unfortunately those moments aren't as often as they have been in the past.
B000063K2W|5.0|This is a better experience on DVD, because if you see it in a theater, it becomes a distorted experience with people carrying on and hissing.  It has become a camp classic, but it's really a classic, and when you see it alone, you realize certain things about it that are not apparent in a screaming audience.<BR>     1) Shearer's performance is excellent -- and in the least flashy role.  <BR>     2) The whole movie is a case of bizarre casting that worked surprisingly well.  Three examples:<BR>      a)Shearer.  She didn't play women like this usually.  She played sexually sophisticated ladies -- even after the Production Code.  But she brings a probity to this role that has become inextricably linked with her cinematic image (to a degree that has actually done her a disservice) mainly because she is so good here.<BR>      b) Crawford.  She is supposed to be sexy young thing who steals away Shearer's husband.  But Crawford was at least ten years older than the role, and a good five years too old for the part.  At 35, she looked like a hard 40, and no younger than Shearer.  It's hard to conceive of any man dumping his family for such an obvious barricuda -- especially one who looks like a guy in drag.  And YET -- she's great in the role.  A lot of fun.  And Crawford, as she often did, brings all of her bitterness and resentment to the role, and it works.<BR>     c) Rosalind Russell.  Who'd have ever thought she had THAT in her.<BR>     <BR>      Also check out Paulette Godard, again, different from anything else she ever did (and looking better than anybody in the movie.)  Now GODARD is what Crystal was SUPPOSED to look like -- not like Wallace Beery in a bathtub.
B00008BXJF|5.0|To say that Crimson is attempting nothing new or original is a bit harsh in my opinion.  It is also incorrect.  Yes it is instantly recognizable as Crimson but is that really a problem?  Years ago fripp and whoever invented a sound that still seems ahead of its time and I don't see any reason why he (they) shouldn't stick with it for as long as they like.  Compared to the rest of the music world it is still new and original.  It's not like we are being forced to listen to this stuff on the radio is it?  Its not even the case that many people understand what is going on here musically.  If they got any more original or inventive would they even have an audience left. To my ears Power to Beleive sounds incredibly fresh and powerful.  The song writing is great and the playing inspired.  Name me anyone who is doing something more interesting that doesn't sound like a bunch of unlistenable meaningless noise.  I feel that KC is still very new and original and I feel lucky that every few years they feel the need to remind us of this fact!
0062502182|5.0|A view from a first-time reader in its original Portuguese language, and some years later in English. <br />First of all, nothing has been lost in the translation to English. My compliments to Mr. Alan Clarke!<br />The beauty of this book is that the story is short and deceptively simple, yet so craftily woven that it entertains and captivates the reader while at the same time contributes to a sense of greater self-knowledge. In other words, it doesn't feel like a self-help book, but rather more like magic. It makes one want to stop and think, and re-evaluate everything in one's own life.<br />The secret is that most people can identify with the story in one way or another because it deals with fundamental lessons we should hopefully all be learning!<br />A new twist. Try this: read it and put it away. A few years from now, take it down from the shelf and read it again. You may just find as I have,  that each time you read it the insight becomes deeper. However, it still feels as if you were reading the story for the first time, but with a wiser mind. And perhaps because of this, each time you do, you may experience a new discovery.
B00004R99T|2.0|I liked the original movie...I was not impressed with this sequel.  And neither were my girls, ages 3 & 4.  They began playing and not even paying attention to this movie about 1/3 of the way into it.  It was an okay movie - but rent it - don't buy it!<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B00005OAIE|1.0|Just add 4 guys and you have N'SYNC.  I bought this cd for my girlfriend because I heard that it was sentimental and stuff, but that was the biggest mistake of my life.  His songs are terrible.  I hear all this stuff that his lyrics are genius as is his record.  Honestly, have you listened the words.  The guy sings about georgia and neon.  I will give him one thing, he is a good guitar player, but brilliant he is not.  This is a piece ... aimed to the likes of college radio and 17 year old girls.  When listening to this I wanted to ....  John Mayer isnt brilliant, his lyrics are not that good, and he cant sing good at all.  Please in the name of all that is good in the world, dont buy this, I beg of you.  Hes not that good, it is just superficial rock with no point.
B000066HHK|5.0|though only 6 tracks, this is an awesome cd. it shows a rawer side of linkin park than in hybrid theory and meteora. chester bennington's vocals are more powerful and mike shinoda's rapping is too good for words. &quot;mastered numerology and big bang theology, performed labodomies with telekinetic psychology.&quot; you cant tell me that isnt talent. 5+ stars for this cd
B00003CXXM|5.0|Lots of action.  Pretty good acting.   Nice locations. (Prague, Czech Republic. Paris, France.)  Fun car chases.<br />DVD extras.<br />Audio Commentary - 1. Matt Damon - Star, Doug Liman - Director<BR>Making-of - 1. THE MAKING OF THE BOURNE IDENTITY
B00008CLOA|5.0|I own two copies of this CD already (this is something like the fifth time the album is being released on CD if you count the &quot;Shine On&quot; boxed set) and was skeptical that the sound quality would be markedly improved over the most recent remaster from 1994. Happily, the investment was well worth it as the SACD remastering process has given this classic Floyd masterpiece a marvelous upgrade. The sound effects really jump out at you, especially if experienced with the benefit of a surround sound system. This is without question the greatest Pink Floyd album and one of the best rock and roll albums of all time. The liner notes are a treat as they provide a collection of &quot;Dark Side&quot; pictoral artifacts over they years including rare album covers and band photos. My only complaint, albeit a minor one is the cover, which has again been tampered with and updated in this most recent reissue. The original stark black album jacket with the light striking the prism was designed by Hipgnosis and remains one of the most classic pieces of cover artwork.
B0000029DD|5.0|It is so sad that such a wonderfully talented musician would have to leave us so soon.I am a huge Buckley fan,and I love Grace. From the sweeping guitars in \\"Grace\\",to the seductive vocals on \\"Lover You Should've come Over\\"....on to the haunting beauty of \\"Hallelieujah\\" - Grace is a true masterpiece.Jeff Buckley was a genius,and his music will live on forever.<BR>This album is worth every cent.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Some bands continue to change their sound with each album (ex. Metallica, U2, Depeche Mode, etc.) others seem to just recycle their old stuff ( AC/DC, Ozzy, Creed,etc.)With Meteora, Linkin Park seems to have chosen the latter of the two. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. While it is not a far stretch from Hybrid Theory, there is evidence of Linkin Park's growth musically. If you were a fan of Hybrid Theory, I am sure that Meteora will not let you down. While many of the tracks on Meteora are similar to those on Hybrid Theory, they do take on their own style. Many of the tracks use more sampling, and try new effects, like violins, flutes, and orchestra effects. The most negative thing about Meteora is the length of the album. Only about 37 minutes. But at least its not 10 minutes of greatness and 27 minutes of garbage like you will get with many albums. The highlights of this album are:<br />13. Numb - Definitely the best track on the album<BR>7. Faint <BR>4. Lying From You <BR>2. Don't Stay<BR>9. Breaking the Habit<br />Of course, there are the radio frienly tracks that you'll be sick of hearing by next year:<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong (The first single)<BR>6. Easier to Run<BR>10. From the Inside<br />Overall, it's a pretty good cd. Worth spending your hard earned $$ on. Linkin Park appears to be the most talented of the rap/rock genre. Sorry Limp Bizkit fans.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I am without a doubt one of the biggest Linkin Park fans. Ever since I heard the first song released close to four years ago \\"One Step Closer\\" I was hooked. I traveled on the road and followed the band listening to their music because I enjoy it that much. I was probably one of the first people in the music store to buy this album when it was released and listened to it a few times over. I was surprised that Linkin Park had tried some things that aren't really their style and wasn't able to pull it off or execute it as well. They have many songs unreleased to the public that I have listened to, various demos and other mixes of their music. It almost seems as if Linkin Park is trying too hard to be something they aren't and fell flat on their face. The CD is good, don't get me wrong. Hybrid theory I could listen to over and over and over and loved every song on it. However, with Meteora, I find myself skipping tracks and turning it off after a couple songs. Sorry guys but Linkin Park just needs to get back to their roots. I would not recommend necessarily owning this CD but at least listen to it, borrow it from a friend or sample it at a music store. Burn it if you want, I would'nt spend [money] bucks for a CD that isn't even 40 minutes and half of it is [bad]. It seems that Linkin Park has bought into the same system they speak out against and tried to recreate their old sound with songs like \\"numb\\" and \\"easier to run\\". Linkin Park already has many fans, but tried to succumb to the mainstream sound and gain more fans. Yet, in the process it seems to have alienated and pushed away the die hard Linkin Park fans.
B00005OAIE|3.0|Only when listening to the track &quot; Body is A wonderland&quot; over the MTV, did I go out to search for his album, rather unknown in this part of the country. Does have a youngish voice.

B000084T18|3.0|&quot;and you are one of them people who is looking for someone...&quot;<br />One of THOSE people. You can't spell either.
B00008H2LE|4.0|After the mega success of Linkin Park's first album 'Hybrid Theory', it was inevitable that there would be a follow-up. 'Meteora' is the long awaited second album after a 4-year wait. (Reanimation was released in 2002, however it was a remix album). The sound of Meteora is distinctly different from 'Hybrid Theory' but nonetheless it still has that Linkin Park edge. The song &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; is one example of the new type of sound that Linkin Park is heading towards, much heavier than other songs they have done. <br />The Enhanced CD contains a 17-minute interview entitled `The Art of Meteora' and a promo for the Linkin Park Underground.<br />This Limited Edition version contains a bonus DVD with a 35-minute documentary on the making of Meteora. A very insightful journey into the production of the second album with many funny anecdotes including a hilarious song called \\"The Wizard Song\\" from Chester.<br />Even though the album is short it is still an awesome experience. `Meteora' is a must for fans of Linkin Park and is still recommended for non-fans of the band.
1563894696|4.0|I RECENTLY PURCHASED LONG HALLOWEEN, MY MAIN REASON BEHIND IT BEING WORD-OF-MOUTH AND THE POSITIVE REVIEWS THAT IT HAD RECEIVED. I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT I WAS NOT DISSAPPOINTED. THE STORY WAS VERY WELL-WRITTEN AND IN MY OPINION IS ONE OF THE BEST. THE STORY IS GRITTY, MYSTERIOUS (JUST THE WAY BATMAN STORIES SHOULD BE) AND IMMEDIATELY SUCKS YOU INTO THE PLOT. THIS BEING A YEAR ONE STORY, LOEB INDICATES BOTH THE WEAKNESS AND THE STRENGTH OF THE DARK KNIGHT THAT ULTIMATELY COST HIM HIS FRIENDHIP WITH HARVEY DENT. THIS IS ALSO AN ORIGIN STORY OF TWO-FACE, BUT W/ THE FOCUS BEING MAINLY ON HARVEY DENT AND HIS DRIVEN DESIRE TO ERADICATE CRIME. COMMISSIONER GORDON IS ALSO CASUALLY THROWN INTO THE MIX TO SPICE UP THE STORY. THIS STORY ALSO GREATLY HUMANIZES BATMAN, AS WELL AS DENT. YOU ACTUALLY FEEL KINDA SORRY AT THE END OF THE STORY FOR THE POOR GUY. NOW THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE STORY, LET'S GET TO THE ART WORK. TIM SALE DOES A REMARKABLE JOB, HIS STYLE IS A BIT CARTOONY BUT HE STILL KEEPS IT DARK (AS IT SHOULD BE IN A BATMAN STORY). THE ART PERFECTLY COMPLEMENTS THE STORY. ALL INALL, I'D SAY THIS BOOK IS HIGHLY ENJOYABLE AND A MUST HAVE FOR BATMAN-FANS AS WELL AS COMIC BOOK FANS OUT THERE. TRUST ME, YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED.

B00008H2LB|5.0|This is easily the absolute best cd to come out so far this year.  \\"Meteora\\" easily surpasses the fantastic \\"Hybrid Theory\\".  If these guys keep coming out with material this good they should be around for a long time.  The album is somewhat short time-wise, coming in around 35 minutes, but what this album lacks in length, it makes up in quality.  The radio friendly \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" can't even compare to what the rest of the tracks are like.  My personal favorites are numbers six, nine, ten, eleven , and thirteen.  \\"Easier to Run\\", \\"Breaking the Habit\\", \\"From the Inside\\", \\"Nobodies Listening\\" and \\"Numb\\" respectively.  \\"Easier to Run\\" has a nice little quiet intro followed by some great DJing skills.  \\"Breaking the Habit\\" is a great if somewhat disturbing song about uncontrollable violent tendecies.  \\"Nobodies Listening\\" has a somewhat haunting Japanese Flute mixed in for a great effect.<br />The extra's thrown onto the disc are also worth some mention.  There's an eighteen minute video about the art behind the production of the album.  There are some wallpapers, links to various websites of interest, and even some website tools.  Also you can find the music video for \\"Somewhere I Belong\\".  To nicely round out the package is forty page color booklet with lyrics and notes behind how each song was written, and who came up with what.<br />BUY THIS DISC.  Don't download it, don't have your buddy make you a copy, and please don't steal it.<br />BUY IT. <br />It's definetly worth the money.
B00005JXY3|3.0|\\"We'll live forever, knowing together that we did it all for the Glory of Love...\\" The sweeping strains of that Peter Cetera theme song still choke me up. If the first \\"Karate Kid\\" set the standard, then \\"The Karate Kid: Part Two\\" cemented the legend. Watch as Mr. Miyagi confronts the culture he left behind in Okinawa. Remember, this kindly old guru of the martial arts was an American WWII vet, so his former Japanese compatriots are less than thrilled at his return. Meanwhile, Daniel-San takes on local hood Chozen, breaking it down while breaking glass as the Moody Blues blare on the soundtrack. The romance, the courage, the honor, the camaraderie is all here, as Daniel learns the eternal secret to making some dude's nose honk. \\"Live or die, man.\\" To live in a world without \\" The Karate Kid\\" just wouldn't be the same.
B000002KDX|5.0|When the trio America -- originally based in England -- released this debut album in 1971, they were by som critics accused of ripping of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, and even though it´s a highly unfair remark, there are musical similarities between the groups: overdubbed six- and twelve-strung acoustic guitars, knock-out vocal harmonies and well-crafted compositions. This is how REAL unplugged music sounds like!<br />After this, they released -- in my opinion -- two albums that as a whole were quite dissapointing (although one of them contains their best song ever -- &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;) before producer George Martin got hold of them and put them back on the right track again -- even though he had a tendency to overproduce their songs. However, this debut album is unique in its nakedness and unpretentious production, and these guys -- Gerry Beckley, Dewey Bunnell and Dan Peek -- doesen´t really need any other than themselves. Just three-four ac. guitars, vocals, bass, a bit of piano and some occasional percussion -- that´s all (on one or two tracks you can also hear David Lindley play steel guitar). And the´ve never sounded better than this. Just listen to the harmonies and the guitar chords!<br />The album wasn´t short of hit singels either, like for example &quot;A Horse With No Name&quot; (their most classic tune). But equally interesting are &quot;Riverside&quot;, &quot;I Need You&quot;, &quot;Never Found the Time&quot;, &quot;Three Roses&quot; and &quot;Children&quot; (unlike most others I´m not that particulary found of &quot;Sandman&quot;, however). But most astonishing is, how an album that pure in its musical production still manage to keep up your interest throughout the whole record, and also ages well! How many albums made today will be able to repeat that achievment?
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Johnny is such a sad old little man, and that's why I feel bad saying that his version of hurt is so heinously and mildy &quot;uh&quot; that I don't need to say anything else. The reasons to buy this album are Fiona Apple on Bridge Over Troubled Water, and Nick Cave on I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry. The rest of the album fits in around these tracks in an okay kind of way.<br />he's no bjork though
B00007AJGH|5.0|I won't reiterate the story (you can get that from the editorial review).  I would like to highlight what makes this DVD etraordinary,  what to look out for, and why you should consider buying it:<br />-The packaging is very nice.  Typical \\"Vista Series\\" Quality.<br />-The extras are first rate.

B00004T8RK|3.0|Pearl Jam..the Seattle sound pioneer and innovators of modern rock concert experiences have gone through many trials and made  awesome albums since their inception in the early 90's. Binaural is not one of them. While in my humble opinion there can never be a bad Pearl Jam album, this one doesnt do any justice to the band's power and incredible sound. A lot of the tracks are great pieces, of course, but some others just left a little to be desired. Here's the breakdown of the album,and my two cents on each track:<br />1. Breakerfall: Short, intense, uptempo. I cant think of a good anger release opener recently like this one.<br />2. God's Dice: Another rocker , this one sounding a bit punkish.<br />3. Evacuation: Matt Cameron's first Pearl Jam song is not up to snuff to the many other songs in the band's catalogue. Passable rock.<br />4. Light Years: Now THIS is Eddie Vedder at his finest songwriting moments. Great lyrics and pace to the song.<br />5. Nothing as it seems: The album's first single, and not a good choice for that distinction. Sounds pretty bluesy, out of place in this album.<br />6. Thin Air: Another great ballad from the band. Very moving lyrics.<br />7. Insignificance: This is where the album gets a bit wee political and Mike McCready starts becoming the guitar sound effects guy instead of the lead guitarist. Great ending solo nonetheless.<br />8. Of the girl: Another slow piece and another out of place piece in this album. Ed hasnt found his folky sound yet here.<br />9. Grievance: More politics!! This song would be perfect to play right at this moment, what with the war and all. And again, McCready as sound effects guy.<br />10. Rival: the song that sent chills in me when i first heard it. Good lyrics, but could sound a lot better musically.<br />11. Sleight of hand: An experimental piece..they've done  a few of those lately. Weird sound, just totally unexpected out of Pearl Jam<br />12. Soon Forget: Eddie's first foray into the ukulele produced this song for the band. An awesome folky tune, especially with the true to life words.<br />13. Parting ways: The closer features a viola! Pretty strange closer, and not that good of a piece either. Passable listening.<br />And then there is the &quot;writer's block&quot; ending to the album featuring Eddie Vedder typing away. Interesting....<br />So there you go, Binaural for ya! Again, not their best, but certainly not  a bad album by the band. BTW, in case you're wondering about the title, &quot;Binaural&quot; is the recording process the band used for most of the tracks on the album. It involved having sounds from two separate sources or something like that. Enjoy the album.
B00008H2LB|5.0|No one hated LP more than I did after they released the same album like 10 times with just re-mixing the songs.  I wrote them off as just another one-hit wonder.  I was a HUGE fan of Their first album and was completely let down with their other releases.  As soon I popped this on in the cd player, I was immediately impressed.  Since then, i have heard the cd through like 10 times and each time I like it even MORE!! This album is AMAZING!! I proably like it better than the first.  Good job LP!
B000067IZ3|5.0|Traffic:<br />Starring Michael Douglas and Cathrine Zeta-Jones,<br />This is a film is about drugs, family and law. It all comes together magnificantly. One of my favorite movies of all time. Revealing the truth about drugs!
6305014140|5.0|This was by far one of the greatest Anime's ever produced.  It's a must buy.  It's the bench mark for all Anime movies.  The characters are great and if your into Anime and sword play this is the DVD for you.  I'm waiting for the next chapter.
B00006I9HJ|5.0|AS AN AVID READER OF ROLLING STONE AND SPIN I FOUND MYSELF CURIOUS AS TO WHY THE ALBUM WAS GIVEN AN ABOVE AVERAGE REVIEW. AFTER LISTENING TO THE FIRST COUPLE OF TRACKS I IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THE ALBUM AND DEFINITELY AGREED WITH THE REVIEWS.NADA SURF WRITES ABOUT SIMPLE THINGS IN LIFE THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO INSTEAD OF THE MAINSTREAM GARBAGE ON MTV LIKE GANGSTAS AND EXPENSIVE CARS.THE SONG WRITING IS LOVELY AND HONEST.THAT'S HOW ROCK AND ROLL WAS AND THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE. I'M NOT BASHING MTV OR MAINSTREAM ARTISTS, BUT LISTENING TO MY HEART WHICH BEATS FOR A REBIRTH OF ROCK AND ROLL AND FOR A LOVE OF REAL SONG WRITING.THANK YOU NADA SURF FOR LETTING GO.
B000088E6D|5.0|MICHAEL WHERE DID YOU COME FROM.... YOU ARE BY FAR THE BEST THING I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF LISTENING TO SINCE ELVIS LEFT THE BUILDING.   WELCOME TO OUR EARS AND HEARTS.  THIS C.D. IS REMARKABLE, WITH A FANTASIC BAND AND GREAT ARRANGEMENTS.  YOU ARE SO FRESH AND SMOOTH THAT I HAVEN'T TAKEN THE C.D. OUT OF MY PLAYER SINCE I BOUGHT IT.  HAD TO GO OUT AND BYE TWO MORE FOR MY CAR AND MY HUSBANDS CAR ALSO.  WE BOTH HAVE NOT TURNED ON THE RADIO SINCE WE DISCOVERED YOU.  KEEP THEM COMING AND LOOK AFTER THOSE MAGNIFICANT SET OF PIPES YOU POSSES.  YOU ARE THE NEXT BEST THING...I FEEL SORRY FOR ANY THAT TRY TO COMPETE OR EVEN TRY TO MATCH THIS MASTERPIECE!!!!!! ALL I CAN SAY IS WELL DONE MICHAEL AND DAVID.
B00008H2LB|4.0|If you are already a fan of LP then you will probably like this album.  LP have definitely found their formula and they are not going to mess with it: sing, rap, mellow, loud, scream repeat.  Critics of this genre will hate this.  But this is an undeniable infectious album that has a lot of emotion and dynamics to it.  This is a great follow up and LP will not be denied.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a wonderful movie. A fairytale with beautiful colours and interesting persons. I've watched it a million times, and can't get enough of it. Also the music is great to listen to. And makes you fell like you're part of the movie.
B00000JJHZ|3.0|this is undoubtedly one of the best jazz recordings of all time, but this title is not a full DVD-A. it is a two-channel, 24 Bit, 96kHz DVD-A and as such only explores half the possibilities of the format. Even so, it sounds TWICE as good as the CD, which i also have, and i regularly use this as a comparison for people who doubt the power of 24 bits. <br />So if you are a coltrane fan, this is about the best recording you can have - but if you are a patient man my advice would be to wait for the full 192 kHz version which will undoubtedly be released in the future.
B00008LOS1|4.0|Lifehouse notwithstading, listening to the Deluxe Who's Next reminds me of the beauty and power of the music I heard for the first time on an old 8 track. The bonus NY sessions offer a glimpse of the band's original arrangements of Pete's early demos. Of course the reason to part with hard earned cash for an album played to death on classic rock radio, remastered and re-realeased (along with the bulk of the group's splendid cataloge in 1995)..is the addition of the band tearing through the project live at The Young Vic theatre. All that you would expect with vintage WHO; and all so human.

Then, I was wondering why it didn't get Best Picture...  it was Schindler's List which got it.<BR>The actors and actress performance were very good.  The story is about how the relationship between the main characters developed all around a piano.  Still, there were weak spots.  For example, I can't tell how / why would Ada fall in love with the neighbor... but love has... no reasoning in it?  or it's just because Ada 'hate' her husband giving away her piano?<BR>4 stars only, because there was a vertical yellowish 'line' appears on the left hand side during playback that's TOO VISIBLE.  It must be some kind of transfer problem.  Sound quality?  It's Dobly 2.0 only (Stereo) but I don't really care about it.  We're not talking about action movies here.  Still, it really worth seeing regardless of its quality fallbacks.

0385508417|5.0|Sometimes a person just needs to have some fun.  And this book is fun.  For the past two years, my friends, family and I have gotten away from the hub-bub associated with the Thanksgiving through Christmas period by reading SKIPPING CHRISTMAS.  The book was predictable and silly, which made it fun to read.  It's a little book that &quot;reads&quot; quickly.  Grisham is a master with word pictures.  A group of neighbors protesting in front of the house of the one rebel who won't decorate his home like the others?  FREE FROSTY!  HA!!  When the annoying little boy next door asked Luther why he was brown (tanning lamp), I laughed out loud.  In fact, the entire book was full of chuckles, giggles, and laughing out loud!  A no-brainer, un-serious book that you read just for the fun of it.
0316666343|4.0|I found this book to be a surprising change from the ordinary, and creative in its use of an alternative viewpoint. Perhaps one of the most important things to consider when reading this book is the sensitivity of the subject being dealt with. Today, we are accustomed to violence in media, and attempts to deal with it in an indirect manner are often accused of being sugar-coated and worse.<br />  However, this book does a very good job of dealing with the human rather than technical issues of the murder of the narrator, and therein lies its strength, and therefore a reader must be open to seeing these issues to get the best of this book.<br />  That said, while it is a literary lightweight, the bonus is that it is highly accessible. There is little in the book that requires a literary education to comprehend, yet it is deep enough to provide a meaningful context for the subject. Even the issue of rape is dealt with delicately, bt still considering the subject matter, I wouldn't recommend it for younger readers, however given proper preparation it would be ideal for the \\"older\\" set of young adult readers, as well as mature readers.
B000002J0G|5.0|When I find myself seething and in the need for something that manifesting these feelings externally, I sometimes find myself tuning into Testament's Low. Why? Because it has the right combinations of metal to make something digestible for the anger-ridden stomach, plus it provides commentary on every portion of society that is, in some right, sacred and therefore questionable. From the manifestations of the family and the building blocks of internal scarification that it sometimes is to the ritualism we deem social responsibility, it all finds itself looked upon and, in some way, frowned at. Personally, this is what I expect from Testament, the driven sounds and the aggressive vocals that sometimes bleed and sometimes growl anger into existence, and is a step back in the right direct that The Ritual - a good listen but not a Testament album - didn't provide.<br />Of the songs on the album, I find myself fond of &quot;Of Dog Faced Gods&quot; the most, with its growling stylization of vocals meshing well with messages about the Egypt of yore and the thunderous pulse within its temponic heartbeat. It, by far, is the most driven piece on the album and shows a band that has, in some rights, matured over time and learned their craft while not sacrificing the heaviness that sometimes goes with age. I'm also taken by the track, &quot;P.C.,&quot; which angrily questions the role of our leaders in a dysfunctional society and encourages the people under those thumbs not to be complacent, and &quot;Legions (In Hiding), which throws lights onto the shadowy role of family and the manifestation of horrors that children oftentimes find themselves barraged by. There is also one slower track with a message that I found sorrowfully enjoyable, with its notations of suffering in &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; and the release that will finally lead to the end of the pain that was suffered by a nation of people.<br />There are other notables on the album as well, lending themselves to a return to form that I found myself sorely missing. Fans of the older Testament will find pieces here that sing songs of the beast of &quot;once before,&quot; and people that enjoyed the growth that the band has shown over the years will find this something worth picking up. Recommended to fans of the heavy genres dancing in the sardonic veins of the sound spectrum.turn to form that I found myself sorely missing.

076790592X|5.0|This book is truely a book to read. I definately had my hesitations about reading Tuesday with Morrie. In the end it really made me think about my own life, and how i might be able to become more like Morrie.  I believe there are many lessons that can be learned from reading this book. I greatly recommend this warm, and enlightening book!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is one of the best albums i have heard since Seether's album Disclaimer. These songs, as some might expect, as kind of similar to the first, yet different. Its an awesome Cd, and i really recommend it to anyone who likes rock!
B00000DFKF|5.0|Burzum's two first official outpourings on one disc. This is an adventure of one man's youthful sense of imagination which helps to explore and reinvent a more classical musical structure. Amateurish in the most positive sense of the word, Vikernes is unafraid to make sudden tempo-shifts and unorthodox layering of instruments that would never fit the mainstream. (Did he ever turn professional? His unbound mind refused, of course.)<br />Passionate, characteristic vocals face that which must be faced, as surprisingly slow and sloppy but inventive drumming cover the background with droning distortion of guitars. Synthetic material is revealed in \\"Channeling the Power of Souls Into a New God\\", but this early in Burzum's evolution, these elements are woven into the guitar/drum/vocals-standard only on \\"Stemmen Fra Taarnet\\", as an omen of things to come. Much of this music is Bathory-inspired (which Black Metal is not?); \\"War\\" is supposedly a tribute (more or less a steal of Bathory's \\"Necromansy\\"), but is obviously a bit too awkwardly \\"rocky\\" to fit a project like this.<br />Some great ideas and visions here lie scattered, but this does not in any way inhibit the sheer greatness of this disc. As this is an early reaction to the discovery of the Christian madness, the music and attitude is more hateful than on later works, but even this early is about to create \\"new meaning\\"...
B000083C49|5.0|After the often overshadowed Star Trek III, producer Harve Bennett and returning director Leonard Nimoy wanted to make a light-hearted adventure with no deaths. That was understandable because III had the destruction of the Enterprise, the death of Kirk's son, and an overall serious revival adventure for Mr. Spock. After a script by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes (with Eddie Murphy originally supposed to have a role because he was a big Trek fan), Harve Bennett needed a rewrite. The man chosen: Nicholas Meyer, writer and director of Star Trek II.<br /><br />What we have here is one of the magnum efforts in the series. Not only does it deliver solid laughs from start (ok, more so middle) to finish, it is also a grand adventure that Roddenberry probably loved. The relationships between the characters are fully exploited here and Nicholas Meyer even takes advantage of Spock's rebirth as humor. The laughs? Filled with classics like Scotty's \\"Hello computer\\" scene or the hospital chase scene, this film perfectly blends urban realities with the world of Star Trek in a similar way to Beverly Hills Cop's blending of action and comedy.<br />The only thing that flaws this film is Leonard Rosenman's somewhat lackluster score. The film manages to blend (or hide, depending on if you like the score or not) the music enough that you really don't notice it. I still would've preferred James Horner or Jerry Goldsmith, but I'm not complaining.<br />Hate Star Trek? Watch this film. Even if you hate Star Trek, this will keep you entertained. An excellent film in every sense of the word with great humor abounds. Some people may claim II or VI as the best, but this one's got its share of moments. If you're looking for great humor and a decent story (ok, it's corny... \\"save the whales\\", so what?), this one's for you.

B00005JKHP|2.0|[BEFORE YOU VOTE ON THIS REVIEW, KEEP IN MIND THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN THE DIRECTOR'S EDITION OF THIS FILM.  I WILL REVIEW THAT LATER ON IN THE FUTURE.  IF YOU VOTE NEGATIVELY, I WILL ASSUME THAT YOU LOVE THIS FILM UNCONDITIONALLY.]<br />With the Trek animated series going from 1973-1974 and a loyal fan following growing enormously through Star Trek's syndicated run, Gene Roddenberry proposed &quot;Star Trek II&quot; as a new series.  But that eventually led to the groundwork for the new Star Trek film.  With a grand budget, an excellent musical composer named Jerry Goldsmith (who would receive an Oscar nomination for this, but lost to George Delarue's &quot;A Little Romance,&quot; which is a tragedy), veteran director Robert Wise at the helm, and the original cast back, this would seem like a dream.<br />Unfortunately, it was not meant to be.<br />Jerry Goldsmith's score and some impressive visual effects were the only things keeping this thing alive.  It's extremely boring.  The characters don't really strike a chord (there's hardly any humorous interaction between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy) and it moves slowly.  The character interactions that we so loved are vacant here, which is quite a shame.  It almost plays like &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; but really shouldn't.  Robert Wise is an ideal director and it's not his fault; it's clearly Roddenberry's (in production notes, he and screenwriter Harold Livingston fought constantly and this often delayed drafts).<br />It's a strange paradox because the story itself is not bad.  It's filled with hints of human nature and it even involves NASA.  Sadly, it being very similar to the original Trek episode &quot;The Changeling&quot; is all too apparent.  This story would've made a good film (after all, it worked with &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;2010&quot;); it was just executed in a minimal and slow-moving way.<br />Overall, I would probably slate this at being the bottom of the Trek series.  Some people might place V, Insurrection, or Nemesis at the bottom, which can be debated... but to me, the first one is boring and lacks character.  Needlesstosay, Roddenberry was removed as head of the trek films and Harve Bennett would revive Star Trek's second rebirth, which would be claimed as the best by many in the series... The Wrath of Khan.ection, or Nemesis at the bottom, which can be debated... but to me, the first one is boring and lacks character.

B00008H2LB|5.0|this album is not quite as good as the first, but only because it is lacking a single like &quot;in the end&quot;.. but this album exceeded all of my expectactions.
B00008H2LB|3.0|So we've waited nearly two years for what sounds like Hybrid Theory...Ya know, usually when you pick up a NEW CD, you don't expect it to sound just like its predecessor. But Meteora manages to do just that. Easier to Run is essentially Crawling, Faint is a mix of Points of Authority and In The End...etc. I've heard this all before. While I loved Hybrid Theory, I couldn't bring myself to actually keep this in my CD collection. Why? Well, for one thing, it's 36 minutes long. I mean, come on, some Simpson shows are longer (and more fufilling) than this album. The gutiars grate out one to three note riffs, the beats (while decent) aren't focused on, and the vocals are all presented in the same fashion on every song. The only real redeeming songs on this album are Hit The Floor, Nobody's Listening (to this album! Badda ching), and Session. And Session is my favorite track...and yet it's just one little DJ. Mr. Hahn really shows his talent here. And, who knew that with the former two songs I mentioned, that Linkin Park could pull of DECENT Rapcore? We need to see more of this experimental side from these guys, because this whole rehashing of an old formula won't get the big bucks EVERY time.
B000089RVX|3.0|This is a mediocre album at best, even for fans of metal/industrial stuff.  Amy Lee is NOT a great singer, contrary to popular belief...- Aimee Echo, of Human Waste Project and theSTART has a much better, haunting voice.  The production is very contrived, with very simple guitar parts, string backgrounds, and beats.  The whole album is the basically the same song rehashed a bunch of times, except for My Immortal, which is a mediocre piano ballad that doesn't fit with the rest of the album.Don't get me started on the unoriginal lyrics - ...The best part of the album is the beginning of \\"Haunted\\" (where, coincidentally, Amy Lee's vocals are distorted) - but you can just download that.I guess you might like it if you're a fan of Linkin Park's newer stuff (safe, cliched lyrics, fake-metal, all the songs sound the same, etc.)...
6304981635|5.0|Bruce Lee possessed a certain sense of charisma unlike anyone else I've ever seen.  This historic film includes a never before seen clip of him discussing philosophical concepts with a Shaolin Monk that was not originally shown in the theatrical release, but unfortunately his voice was dubbed by John Little. This is a good movie, a must buy.
B000003TB6|5.0|These guys have brought something new and have done it with panache -- that deserves 5 stars.  One of the all-time great head-nod albums.  Every Roots album has its virtues, but the others are more serious and/or more confrontational.  This is the one with that special something when the stars just lined up.  This is an album you just bounce to, with lyrics you won't tire of, and an assortment of gripping production and vocal styles including skatting and accapella, bagpipes and acoustic upright bass on some tracks.  Inoffensive, unpretentious, this album is about the art of hip hop performance.  It's like a conversation wit' yo man and you just keep nodding your head because goddamit you feel that way too.
B000089RVX|4.0|While the debut album from Evanescence is a nice start, the band has to constantly rely on vocal beauty to overcome average muscianship. If you would like to hear similar music with a more polished and experimental sound, I'd recommend the Italian band Lacuna Coil, which has a similarly enchanting female vocalist balanced by a semi-powerful male counterpart.
B000005HBI|5.0|So Cassandra's &quot;New Moon Daughter&quot; is a gem too, but this album is less known and, while it didn't make an immediate impression on me, I now listen to it a lot more.  There's basically more variety in song style and arrangement and, if you like Cassandra, then just the sound of her voice is heaven.  (If you haven't heard her, her voice is about as distinct as Nina Simone's.)  The key point with Cassandra is: nobody sounds like her so if she isn't in your collection then nothing like her is in your collection.  Her voice is deep and sultry, her music spacious, unrushed -- there's something distinctly southern about it.  She is one of Nora Jones' inspirations, but where Nora's voice is a gentle breeze, Cassandra's is a gathering cloud, and there is no lounge sound to Cassandra's music -- the instruments bleed raw notes.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Is this post-rock? Instru-rock? Ensemble-classical? Who cares what it's called? GYBE make moving, operatic music that is grand in scale and scope, and let's just leave it at that.<br />From the opening moments on the opening track, I knew I was in for ride. The ebb and flow are amazing. GYBE slowly lift you up to an anthemic summit rife with soaring guitars and strings, and then they bring you back down to the depths with throbbing bass lines and trecherous, pounding guitar.<br />This album would be worth the price of admission based on the first song alone, but GYBE grace us with four more majestic pieces that twist emotions with cinematic flourishes. Any band (perhaps they prefer the term \\"collective\\") that can manipulate your thought processes so effortlessly must be doing something right. I'm not sure exactly how they do what they do to me, but I'm always more than happy to go along for the ride.
B000002KAT|5.0|On a recent trip to Arizona with some friends, they played this CD a few times and I really got hooked.  Great collection of non-pop, semi-bluesy, pseudo-spritual songs that draw you in and stay in your head.  A great CD for Van Morrison fans and those who enjoy his more blues-fusion styles.  Give it a listen!  (Thanks Kurtus J. Funk and John Cahill for the rec.)
B00008LOS1|5.0|Any real WHO fan would simply buy this for the 2nd disc itself.  It shows the WHO playing these tunes basically for the first time live.  It kicks!!!I have many bootlegs, but not prime material like this.  \\"Pure and Easy\\", \\"Time is Passing\\" ,\\"Water\\" @ live versions of \\"Gettin' In Tune\\" @ \\"Bargain\\" totally raw how it should be.  This is prime Who  and anyone should listen to how well they played these tunes right off the bat.  Any REAL WHO FAN knows how great THE ORIGINAL WHO'S NEXT is.  You buy this version for the primo soundboard WHO on disc 2.  However, there is a nice jammy \\"Gettin' In Tune\\" @ a different version of \\"WGFA\\" on disc 1.  Say what you might but this may be their best work and possibly a top 5 ALBUM of alltime.  WHO'S NEXT redone again is nice , but the LIVE material is what makes this a must buy.
B00006LIRI|4.0|I give this album 4 out of 5 stars because the songs are pretty good, especially the new stuff and the remixes. However, some songs were on there that I don't feel should have been on there (i.e.-Discotheque, The First Time, Stuck in a Moment) while some of U2's best work was left off (i.e.-So Cruel, Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, Walk On). That being said, the best thing about U2 is that they make such dynamic, powerful music, that each song appeals to different people. So some serious U2 fans may really like Discotheque and think it should be on there while some don't. But I think for the casual U2 fan or someone just getting into U2 (which is usually who Best of albums target), this album doesn't really reflect upon their best work. In my mind, about 75% of these songs deserve to be here. The rest are songs that, although good songs, are not U2's best work and are on this album in place of some good songs that definately should have been here in their place.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This movie is just so awesome.  I keep thinking about the words \\"Yippe Kay-Yay ...\\" in my head.  This movie has turned me into a fan of Bruce Willis.  It has some great acting and a great director (John McTiernan).  I think the great thing about this movie, is that John McClane(Bruce Willis) will often go out of his way, just to get some humor.  Like when he sends a body down an elevator, and has a special message on the body, just to let the terrorists know that he exists.  This is the best out of the series most definately.  Bruce Willis goes and beats down terrorists, and it's funny that he does the whole thing, without any shoes!  It is really neat to have the movie inside of a building.  The movie is very suspenseful, even in some times that you know that McClane will succeed, because it is a movie, your suspense still goes up.  The movie has some clever things, and some predictable things, but wether some things are predictable or not doesn't really matter.  The movie is usually really believable, but there were a few parts...but that is just to keep suspense.  The movie definately deserves the 'Five Star collection' treatment that it has.  The DVD is packed with extra features on two discs...Go buy it today.
B000002BPS|5.0|I really like this album. It actually sounds like \\"Smash\\" and \\"Americana\\" mixed into one. Here are the songs:<br />Disclaimer: 8/10<BR>Great intro spoken by Jello Biafra, former dead kennedy's singer. It is also one of their funnier intros!<br />Meaning of life: 9/10<BR>excellent song about dealing with many of lifes problems. <br />Mota: 10/10<BR>Very catchy beat. If you like L.A.P.D (Ignition), you will probably like this one as well.<br />Me and my old lady: 8/10<BR>a catchy song. I used to like this one more, but I just got tired of it after a while.<br />Cool to hate: 10/10<BR>A great song about just laying back and, well, just hating everything!<br />Leave it behind: 6/10<BR>the only song I really don't like on the album.<br />Gone away: 10/10<BR>A nice, slow song that I think is the best on the album. Very sad lyrics though.<br />I choose: 10/10<BR>A great, catchy song with a great guitar riff. I like the bongos, too.<br />Intermission: 7/10<BR>I like to kick back and listen to this every once in a while, but other than that, I just skip over this.<br />All I want: 9/10<BR>A very cool song that sounds very different from anything else on the album. Too short though.<br />Way down the line: 9/10<BR>a neat song with yet another cool guitar riff.<br />Don't Pick it up: 9/10<BR>This one sounds ska. Very fun, very catchy.<br />Amazed: 10/10<BR>Another slow song that sounds similar to \\"Gone away\\".<br />Change the world: 10/10<BR>The beggining can be heard shortly after the song \\"smash\\" on the album \\"smash\\". Nice chorus and nice guitar.<br />Overall, this is a great album. Pick it up if you're an offspring fan.

0393312836|5.0|I will admit, that I saw the movie befor I read the books so, I had some idea of what to expect or so I thought. The novel is a lot more detailed, in my opinion, then the movie. I will admit that the novel's main form of speaking is through a new type of slang and it may be hard to understand at first, but after a couple of rereadings of a few parts, I feel it will come to you. In the end, Burgess creates a wonderful novel that not only challanges the mind, but also society at the same time.
0060955775|4.0|Witty.. charming.. funny..another journey to self-discovery and enlightment.  Coelho takes you to depths you yourself take in times of hardships and happiness trying to find any kind of explanation to questions we ask ourselves everyday!<br />Veronika draws a picture of her future life based on her own path that she has taken .. useless .. fruitless .. nothing special .. she decides to die because she didn't like  what she saw.  Life in a mental hospital opened up her eyes and mind, and eventually her heart to view life from a different angle. ..through the help of other patients, and not to forget her doctor.<br />I've found the ending really surprising to such a serious subject .. but I think it understates how we sometimes blow things to larger proportions and forget about what really matters.<br />I really enjoyed it!  Veronika was just a means to an end that Coelho intended to prove.  Everyday is a miracle, so enjoy it and make the best of it. Love and friends make a big part of our lives. Many simple things .. a walk by a lake, a friend's smile, a blooming flower, we take for granted are actually a reminder of our own miracle on this planet!
B000003TA4|1.0|Clearly the most overrated album of all time.  A so-called alternative band spends a fortune recording an album with a successful pop producer and it's supposed to be some kind of rock and roll epiphany?  This album is to alternative/punk rock what Poison or Warrant were to Heavy Metal.  Additionally only one member of the band actually has any musical talent; Dave  Grohl on the drums.  Cobain probably blew his brains out because he realized he would be remembered for making an album that has as much artistic integrity as works by N'Sync or Brittany Spears.  Don't buy the hype, this is the [worst] album produced in the 1990's.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park's new album is so awesome. They have sample some really awesome beats. All the songs are very much like what they have done in the past, but that's what's great about it. They didn't change their sound. The only thing I don't like ,is that it's only 36 mins long. There's pop albums longer then that. If you haven't gotten this cd yet, get it, it's so worth ur money.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Hybrid Theory in my mind could not be topped, but I was wrong.  They have done it again, their unique style of rock/rap/techno has astonished me again.  My top three songs (even though all are good): Easier To Run, Don't Stay, and Figure.09.  I'm at a loss of words, unbelieveable, I guess I'll have to see whats next from them...
B00008H2LE|5.0|Talk about hype. The day this album got released, MTV featured the group in a free concert during their $2 Bill segment. Man, these guys just seem to get better. First heard the group way back in 1999 when I got here, was unimpressed initially since they sounded like an ordinary Rap-core croup. They completely got my attention when they released the video Crawling. Excellent Video!!! As the story goes, their first album (Hybrid Theory) sold a gazillion records, and now comes their official sophomore effort (since Re-animation was just considered a remix album) Meteora. Twelve songs tightly wound with much of that sonic punch you’d expect from this group. It’s a proven formula these days when you mix turntables, guitar and screaming coupled with infectious riffs, you’ll come up with a great album. Meteora is not a great album. Meteora will pick you up, control you and  stick in your brain. That tops being great anytime.
B00005JKJA|3.0|I'm not sure if anyone's brought this up in the 700+ reviews, but the reason you can't skip to a scene with this (or any other number of Lynch DVDs) is that Lynch makes a conscious decision to keep this capability off the discs. He wants you to watch the movie the way he intended; strictly from beginning to end.    P.S. When oh when is 'Eraserhead' going to be available on DVD?
B000002UJQ|5.0|Dynamic.  Discordant.  Beautifully profound, and only moreso each time I listen.  This is an album that will burrow into you soul, break your heart, and leave you wondering where the rest of the great music is in the world.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I thouroughly enjoyed the movie and bought the soundtrack the very next day.My personal favorite song of the movie would have to be Mr Cellophane.  John C Reilly's version is haunting and lovely, the man can sing.  All of the stars are excellent in their roles, Queen Latifah has a fabulous voice and does an amazing  job.  While this album does have some extra songs that aren't in the film, at least most all of the actual film versions are on it.
B000084T18|5.0|wow!that is just the word to describe this album. when i spent the momey on this cd, i wasn't sure i had done the right thing BUT when i heard the coin drop(in the intro0 , i thought this album's good!<BR>the song after the intro,WHat up Gangsta is just so..... gangsta! then PATIENTLY WAITING with Em follows it. this one's good( you haters better watch your mouth or he'll break your face!)<BR>but the song that really made me start really liking this album was or is 21 Questions with Nate Doqq. it reveals a side of 50 that i never thought would exist and i hope it does.......<BR>y'all should go buy this album, it's gooddddd!<BR>G-G-G-UNIT!
B00008LOS1|4.0|This is the second time &quot;Who's Next&quot; has been remastered. It is interesting to note that this is the first time the original masters have used in the process.  The sound is excellent. However, the underlaying question remains what exactly is the purpose of the 2 cd version of this set.  While it is great to have commercially available versions of these alternate takes  and live recordings it seems the package could have been reissued more cohesively.  For example the single disk remaster of &quot;Who's Next&quot; contains tracks like &quot;I Don't Even Know Myself&quot; and &quot;Too Much Of Anything&quot; as bonus tracks.  If the purpose of the studio disk is to give the listener an approximation of what the original &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project was meant to be why not add a second studio disk. The second disk could contain these songs plus released studio versions of &quot;Pure And Easy&quot;, &quot;Naked Eye&quot;, &quot;Water&quot; along with studio versions of &quot;Join Together&quot;, &quot;Let's See Action&quot;, &quot;Relay&quot;, &quot;Put The Money Down&quot; and &quot;Time Is Passing&quot; from the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; recordings. This would have given long time fans like myself a more reasonable approximation of the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project.<br />The live disk also presents a problem because a number of songs were deleted due to time constraints.  A great cover of &quot;Bony Moronie&quot; from the 4 cd box set is omitted along with tracks like &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot; and an energetic version of &quot;Baby Don't You Do It&quot; which are available on bootleg copies of this concert.  The live concert at the Young Vic could have been issued in its complete form as a separate 2 disk set.  I get the feeling that approximations of the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project will be issued as many times as Jimi Hendrix' last album.  A problem finally rectified with the release of &quot;First Rays Of The New Rising Sun&quot;.  <br />Even though I would have configured the set differently, it still contains enough essential music to warrant the purchase.  &quot;Who's Next&quot; is one of the best rock albums period. Tracks like &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; &quot;Bargain&quot;, &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; are still used on televsion, movies, and radio to this day.  One of my favorites is John Entwistle's wry &quot;My Wife&quot;. The alternate takes especially &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; provide an interesting veiw of Townshend's creative process.  Some tracks like the great cover &quot;Baby Don't You Do It&quot; and &quot;Love Ain't For Keeping&quot; feature ace guitarist Leslie West from Mountain.  The second disk features the live debuts of many songs from the &quot;Who's Next&quot; album and associated songs from the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project.  Tracks range from the more tentative &quot;Too Much Of Anything&quot; and &quot;Bargain&quot; to more energetic versions of &quot;Roadrunner&quot; and the underrated &quot;Naked Eye&quot;. While this reissue is a good addition my collection of the Who, I feel it could still have been improved upon.
0151008116|4.0|Martel has a great story telling voice, you can hear him telling his tale as though in your and not his characters living room. However, although he can tell a great tale Martel also needs to stick to the tale rather than wax on the greatness of his annoying religion. This is not a tale to \\"make one believe in god\\", it is a tale for people who need to justify why they cannot accept the world for what it really is.<br />Some reviewers claim that those who don't like this book simply don't \\"get it\\", I would counter that the reverse is true... <br />It is a good book, but far from a great book. Philosophically the argument that it is better to believe in a fantasy than in reality will only appeal to those that think in this manner, and be intellectually offensive to those that do not. It will not be making anyone believe in god that does not already do so.
0671510991|4.0|I refer the hono[u]rable reader to the review I gave to Does America Need A Foreign Policy, by Dr. Kissinger, awhile ago.
B00008H2LB|5.0|To me this doesn't sound anything like the first CD, Hybrid Theory, but it is still great.  It's a totally different sound for Linkin Park and it rocks.  Favorite songs are Somewhere I belong and Faint.  Everyone should go buy this now.
0060254920|5.0|This book brought back the child in me.  Great illustrations and use of imagination made it easy for me to romp in the wild with Max.  I would definitely recommend this book for any child; Where the Wild Things Are will ignite anyone's imagination.  I loved this book as a child and nothing has changes since reading it again in my 20's.  This book gives great opportunities to interact with children and to make reading come alive.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|I'm a big fan of musicals, and it's taking me a while to get used to MR.  They used so many different types of existing songs, the whole movie seems very disjointed.  My husband likes the way Nicole Kidman looks in the movie, but we both agree that she's not a strong singer.  The love story is nice.  There are some very funny moments, and I think it's easier to watch if you don't take the movie too seriously.  <br />In spite of my mixed feelings about the movie itself, the DVD is great.  I love the way they did the &quot;behind the scenes.&quot;  If you've seen the movie and know you like it, you definitely should buy the DVD.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I have owned this album in every incarnation (I bought it originally the week it was released.) This is my sixth and best yet. The sound is more organic with much more &quot;air&quot; than I have heard in previous versions. If you have been waiting to buy a SACD player because there wasn't much music selection, now you can justify your purchase.
B00004RF97|5.0|In 1940, Katherine Hepburn's movie career was in desperate condition.  Her 1938 film BRINGING UP BABY, although recognized as a Howard Hawks's masterpiece today, was at the time a box office failure.  The failure signaled the temporary end of demand for her talents in Hollywood, although she had HOLIDAY in the can (and costarring, like both BRINGING UP BABY and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, Cary Grant).  So, she went back to the stage, in a play written specifically for her, and the subsequent hit was an unexpected and triumphant return to the screen for Hepburn.  Her career never looked back again, especially when two years later she teamed with Spencer Tracy for the first time.  Ironically, she originally requested that Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy play the Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart roles.<br />THE PHILADELPHIA STORY is such an extraordinarily well-done film that one can watch it repeatedly, reveling each time in new and hidden details.  It strikes the perfect balance of being spectacularly well-acted, hysterically funny, and delightfully silly while maintaining an elegant veneer.  The cast is nearly overwhelming in its quality, with Hepburn and Grant turning in especially fine performances.  Jimmy Stewart is also superb, though he won an Oscar for this year that he probably didn't deserve.  The Academy in 1940 may have been giving him the award as an apology for not having won the year before for MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON.  Unfortunately, this meant that Jimmy Stewart's best friend Henry Fonda failed to win for one of the finest performances in the history of American cinema, as Tom Joad in THE GRAPES OF WRATH.  Still, although the Oscar clearly should have gone to Fonda, Stewart manages a great turn.  He and Grant manage a great moment when Stewart adlibbed a hiccup, and Grant, not batting an eye, adlibbed, \\"Excuse me.\\"  The rest of the cast is flawless.  Too many excel to mention, but special mention must be made of Roland Young as Uncle Willie, Virginia Weidler in a marvelous turn as Tracy Lord's precocious younger sister, and the erstwhile Errol Flynn nemesis Henry Daniell as the devious and unscrupulous Sidney Kidd.<br />Although this film holds up magnificently upon reviewings, there is nothing like seeing it for the first time.  I remember vividly how exciting it was to watch this in the lamentably demised Lincoln Theater in New Haven, Connecticut, having absolutely no idea how the film was going to end only five minutes before the closing credits.  Who will Tracy marry?  Will she marry?  How will the film managed to tie up all the loose ends.<br />I have a list of my all time favorite lines from films.  One of my favorites comes from this one.  On the morning after Tracy has gotten rip-roaringly drunk, she has almost no memories of what happened, but what she does recall makes her fear that she might have been in a compromising situation with Jimmy Stewart.  After Stewart assures the confused and fearful Tracy Lord that nothing happened because she was drunk and \\"there are rules about that sort of thing,\\" the infinitely relieved Tracy says, \\"I think men are wonderful.\\"<br />The film has managed to permeate our culture in subtle ways, from inspiring musical remakes, to providing famous adult movie stars with their names, to providing foundations for jokes (in the Rocky and Bullwinkle adventure \\"The Ruby Yacht of Omar Khayyam,\\" whenever Bullwinkle sees his jewel encrusted small boat, he mutters under his breath, \\"Yar, yar\\").er in a marvelous turn as Tracy Lord's precocious younger sister, and the erstwhile Errol Flynn nemesis Henry Daniell as the devious and unscrupulous Sidney Kidd.  <br />Although this film holds up magnificently upon reviewings, there is nothing like seeing it for the first time.

B00007G1ZC|4.0|I finally got online after a while and went poking around and stumbled across this DVD just in an off chance.  I was almost completely shocked and amazed to have found it listed.  Finally some of Kurosawa's best movies are coming out of Limbo.  I have read some recent reviews of this new DVD, and hope it isn't quite as bad as they say it is as far as the widescreen and picture quality go.  But of course I am not going to get my hopes up.  I have had this for many many years on VHS, and managed to track down a copy on Laserdisc, just before DVD's for anything ever hit the market.<br />To just make it brief on the review of this movie in general, this is a brilliantly artistic series of short stories, by a super brilliant movie maker.  Years ago I had fallen in love with many japanese movies, and Kurosawa has always been a favorite, and almost never disappointed (even my discriminating and picky taste).  If you have never watched much foreign movies, try to remember to keep an open mind and follow along as best you can.  And watch it again and again to try and catch more things.  Some sequences you may not like a whole heck of a lot, but others will surely touch your heart.  I only wish Kurosawa could have been encouraged to have made many more of these.  The world has truly lost a great visionary of great japanese culture.<br />To tell you a little of what has been going on with some Kurosawa movies, at least in what I have observed.  As near as I can tell, their must have been some problems with Kurosawa's properties when he passed away a number of years ago.  Soon after his passing this particular movie Dreams (among some others), disappeared from the market anywhere on VHS or Laserdisc.  And for years after that nothing was heard or much known what was going on.  Because of this instance, the VHS was off the market for quite a while, then sort of reappeared.  But mostly as a Rental copy...<br />Hopefully now that this has hit the market, it means more of his properties have been released for the general market, and if this DVD copy isn't the best thing around, we can maybe get together and encourage some places (such as Criterion) to look into getting a super great version put out some time in the near future.<br />Oh, and one other thing.  I would have easily given the rating a perfect 5 (which is what the movie itself deserves), but from the reviews of possibly being a bad copied DVD version, I felt I should knock it down to 4.  Hopefully it isn't as bad, but like I said, if it is, hope springs eternal that someone else will get the rights to it and make a super great copy like this so deserves.<br />TANOSHIMU!
0385503954|5.0|I'm not sure why it was a slow start for me. Luckily I kept on reading.. and it was well worth it. I love the characters, the story line, and how the writer sums it all up. I'm not one for cheesy love stories.. there is indeed a love story here, but not at all cheesy or overdone. Beautiful book.
B00005R87Q|5.0|...This is the most adrenaline rush i have ever had watching a movie. It has great scenes and heart pumping music. The movie was one of the best movies i have seen a a long time. I saw it in theatres twice and i bought the DVD. If this movie doesn't give you an adrenaline rush you better go get checked out at the doctors. I would recomend buying this movie and if you ever feel down just pop it in the DVD player and watch it. It will cheer you up when u are in any mood. This is not just a movie for people that love cars. Its a movie for everyone and if u like cars thats an added bonus
B000089RVX|1.0|Bands like this have been around for awhile.  To see this get air play and hear people talk about it like its the newest thing is pretty bad considering the fact the there are other bands that are better. Save your money and buy &quot;Comalies&quot; by Lacuna Coil or &quot;Century Child&quot; by Nightwish.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park's follow up to the smash Hybrid Thoery seems to be meeting with mixed reviews.  In my opinion, Meteora is a clone of Hybrid theory, which still makes it a great album.  What it is lacking is overall depth and more importantly length. I would have liked to have seen a 15 or 16 track offering following more along the lines of Reanimation. This being said, the songs are still executed flawlessly.  Although lacking depth, innovation, and length, Meteora will still please.  Linkin Park will be around for a long time and still has plenty of time to smooth out the edges.
B00008H2LB|5.0|The first album was good, but this album is far superior. Rarely does it get better than this. Give it a listen...this is exceptionally good listening material. It is currently running for best of 2003, can't wait for what The Deftones have to offer later this year
B00005JKNF|3.0|I was so disappointed in this picture.  I looked forward to seeing it - never got a chance to see it on the big screen - so I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  I am such a big fan of British movies, especially mysteries, but there was just something missing from this one. I'm not really sure what it was - the acting was great but story was just OK.  I'm sure others liked it better than I did.
6304666799|5.0|My husband and I saw this when it was first broadcast on PBS.  We were both in complete awe, and I immediately tried to track down a copy of my own.  Adam Cooper is truly amazing... sensual and sexy as the Black Swan, loving and protective as the White Swan.  Yes, the story has nightmarish, Oedipal overtones... this is not your mother's (or grandmother's) Swan Lake.  The poor young prince and his uncaring mother; the fumbling, alienated older prince seeking warmth and affection...it is a very dark fairy tale, in the manner of the original tales of the Brothers Grimm, but I think that it is still true the the idea of the original story.  As for the homosexual \\"overtones\\", well, given that Tschaikovsky himself was homosexual, I find it an ironic and touching homage to a great composer and troubled man.<br />If you are open to a modern production, if you are looking for dance that goes beyond the same old standard, \\"traditional\\" choreography, check this one out.  It is a moving, powerful, and sensual work.  I will certainly buy the DVD.
B000089RVX|5.0|How cool is it to have a heavy metal/industrial band with a female as the lead singer??  I think the last time I heard razor sharp power vocals like this was in the late 70s with Heart (Ann Wilson).  Amy Lee's vocal performance is outstanding!  She sings so crystal clearly and with such power, it's absolutely refreshing!<br />This album has a great collection of tracks, from the heavy hitting &quot;Going Under&quot; to the sinister &quot;My Immortal&quot;.  I've read a few reviews about this band being a &quot;one hit wonder&quot;.  My experience tells me you can not have a recording THIS GOOD and have it be a &quot;one hit wonder&quot;.  I will be extremely disappointed if it is, but I highly doubt it.<br />Rock on Evanescence!!
B00008H2LB|4.0|I have to say that Linkin Park can definetly do better. Overall tho, this album isn't bad, with a mix of techno/heavy rock. I was disappointed in most of the songs (then again I had huge expectations for this CD, and even though I was disappointed I still liked them). I thought there was too much techno and not enough rock. Hybrid Theory really showed what kind of rock LP is capable of and this album didn't really show the same. <BR>Track one is a weird intro thats about 30 seconds long. Track 2 is pretty good. Its one of the heavier songs with some good riffs. Track 3 is Somewhere I belong which we've all heard on the radio. Good song, you probably know it. However, this song turned up to be the best on the album which is disappointing. Track 4 is cool. The rest are okay but from here on until the last song, Numb, songs get progressivley more techno and less rock. Track 12 is an instrumental beat from the DJ which is amazing. It has an incredible scratching solo. <br />Yeah, so this album is pretty good, but LP could have done better. I still give it four stars for the cool beats but I'm a Slipknot/Taproot/Ill Nino fan so I was keen for something heavier. I think LP turned away from the rock scene too much. I know their sound is a mix of techno and rock, but this album turns their sound into alot of techno and a little rock. Most songs only include rock in the chorus and bridge. Its cool that they didn't just sound exactly the same as Hybrid Theory, they changed it up a little, but I think they may have changed it up too much or could have done it a different way. <br />BOTTOM LINE: Meteora is a mix of techno and rock, but LP turned away from their classic heavy screamer style shown in Hybrid Theory. So those of you like that sort of thing I recomend this to you! Incubus fans will like it, so will P.O.D, and maybe Puddle of Mudd guys. But if you like the real heavy stuff (the REAL music) then don't put this on the top of you list.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I was very excited to listen to this sophomore release by Linkin Park.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed!  This album is wrecked with power chords, pleasant progressions/modulations and razor sharp vocals.  The flagship song, &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; is just one of the very power-wrought songs.  Sessions is a definite winner too...Trent Reznor would be proud!!<br />If you enjoy power-metal/industrial - this album is for you!
B000008HZB|5.0|I picked this album up on cassette many years ago as a cutout...  After several years, I found it on CD ... as well at a used CD store because I couldn't find it elsewhere.  That was the best $$$ I spent.  Now, ...I highly recommend you purchase it here on Amazon.  You won't be disappointed if you like the Wilbury's or ELO.  No, it isn't either one of those, but this is Lynne power pop at its finest.  The album is a bit short, but that just means you can hear it again sooner.  I hope he has the desire to put out another album one of these days.
B000005J56|5.0|Great record, great film. The reason for a lot of people to go to Cuba. You feel the warmth of the island. Unbelievable this music wasn't this popular before.
0805062971|5.0|read Fight Club, and you will close the book as a changed man. This is the novel that made me want to read more, because i discovered that reading was actually very fun when it is a good book. now im never not reading something. Fight Club made me change the way i think about many things, including life in general. read Fight Club, and then read it again. it is never enough.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Most people call Linkin Park a rap-metal band.  With no offense to the good rap-metal bands out there, LP are so much more.  They manage to combine virtually every kind of music (with the exception of country), mix it all together, and create a weird-yet-beautiful musical amalgamation.  There's a reason Hybrid Theory was 2001's best selling album, and Meteora is a more than worthy follow up.  With all of the [this] out of the way, here's (what else) a rundown/rating of all the tracks...<br />1. Foreword - Not a music track, but not a bad opening.<br />2. Don't Stay: 5/5 - Great heavy opening track, currently my favorite track (but I've only had it for a day, so it might change).<br />3. Somewhere I Belong: 4.5/5 - Pretty good track; not the best song, but good choice for the 1st single.<br />4. Lying From You: 5/5 - This track has a really cool opening, and has some of the best backing music on the album, and a great chorus.  Definitely a good choice for a future single (note: remember the really short commercials with the spray painter, and some really heavy music played at the end?  It's this track).<br />5. Hit the Floor: 4/5 - Another heavy track - the first half of the album is the heavier part - with more of a hip hop feeling lyrically.  Not bad at all.<br />6. Easier To Run: 4/5 - This song heavily reminds me of Crawling.  It sounds a little repetative, but it's still a good song.<br />7. Faint: 5/5 - Ties with Nobody's Listening as having the coolest backing music.  The chorus really sticks in your (or at least my) head, too...one of the best tracks.  <br />8. Figure.09: 4/5 - This track's a'ight.  Not a standout, but it's not bad playing in the background while you're doing something (like typing a review...).  I have no idea why it's called Figure.09.<br />9. Breaking The Habit: 4.5/5 - This will DEFINITELY be a single someday.  It's a good song, but I'm confused...I'm not sure what the song's about!  I've read the lyrics, but I can't tell if it's about drugs or domestic fighting or tagging or drawing or all of the above or what.  But it's still a really good song.<br />10. From The Inside: 4/5 - A pretty good song with a really good/catchy chorus.<br />11. Nobody's Listening: 5/5 - Okay, this song is cool-as-s**t.  The rapping's alright, but the background music, which is primarily a Chinese flute, makes it sound like someone quietly coming up behind you and swiftly cracking your neck!  This song also has on of the best lines I've ever heard in a Linkin Park song - I hate my rhymes/but hate everyone else's more - sweet!<br />12. Session: 4/5 - The signature Linkin Park instrumental.  Good, but nowhere near as cool as Cure For The Itch.<br />13. Numb: 3.5/5 - This was disappointing.  They closed a really good album with a song that sounds like a filler.  It's not a bad track, but they could've ended the album with something a lot better.<br />Well, that's it.  Overall, Meteora isn't a classic, but it's definitely a great album.  Although the album's a bit short, Linkin Park make it worth the price by loading it up with extras, including a +20 page booklet with band commentary on each song, and enhanced CD stuff that includes a look at the making of the artwork for the album, access to a bunch of Internet-based extras, and (this is really cool) a program to help you create your own website!  Also, if you spend a few extra bucks like I did and get the special edition, you'll get an extra 35-minute DVD that goes behind the scenes of the making of Meteora.  So, what are waiting for?  Go get it - right now!  A note to the band - looking forward to see you on the Summer Sanitarium Tour July 4th!  Later!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Solid, good album, but still not as good as the first.<br />1. Forward - 13 second intro.<BR>2. Don't Stay - A good track. Pretty similar to what you hear on Hybrid Theory, with a more sophisticated sound. 7/10<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong - A OK track, but a poor choice for the first single. Out of everything on the album this one seems the most like Hybrid Theory's leftovers. 6/10<BR>4. Lying From You - Awesome vocals on this one. 8/10<BR>5. Hit The Floor - One of my favorites. Great screaming chorus. 9/10<br />6. Easier To Run - People are calling this a poor copy of &quot;Crawling&quot;, but in my opinion even if the structure is the same, the whole feeling of the song is differnt. 8/10<BR>7. Faint - Really catchy song. One of the heavier ones on the album. 7/10<BR>8. Figure .09 - My least favorite track. Too generic. 5/10<BR>9. Breaking The Habit - Real standout. This track has no rapping, and using some interesting strings. 9/10<BR>10. From The Inside - Pretty generic, but I love the chorus. 8/10<BR>11. Nobody's Listening - Almost a solid hip hop track, except for the rock-flavored chorus. One of the best. 10/10<BR>12. Session - Fun, but not as good as &quot;Cure for the Itch&quot;. - 7/10<BR>13. Numb - Best song on the album. Similar structure to Hybrid Theory, without feeling old. 10/10.<br />Overall: A great, solid album, but it lacks the furiousity that Hybrid Theory has. If you liked Hybrid Theory, you'll probably like this. I predict another big seller, but in my mind it still doesnt quite equal the first.
B000002V0Q|5.0|This is an absoulute amazing album in all ways. The mini drum solo on the first song hits you like a baseball bat in the face. And the rest of the album goes on in the same heavy mannor. This is a dark and heavy album with lyrics about paranoia, suicide atempts, greed and loneliness but the lyrics are allways well written and serious and there is allways a thought behind every song. The production is great, this might be the most well produced album of all times and it is over 10 years old! How did they manage to do that back then. Metallicas Black album is also a huge improvement since Justice but this is perfect. The songs are all special and hellish good. Rust in Peace is maybe more melodic and freneticly played but this album has another strength, the ballence. Every single song is placed in the right possition and none of them are too long or too short. Megadeth was still not commercial in any aspect but this album is a little easier to listen to than RIP. Its very hard to say wich song is the best one, but one thing is for sure. Ashes In Your Mouth has the best lyrics. Read them and think it over.
B00008H2LB|5.0|It may be short, but every song is great. The lyrics are good, the music is better, and the CD is just perfect. I don't care what everyone else says, this is the best rock album available.

B00003CXXM|2.0|When I first watched this movie, I had not read the book (an excellent story by Robert Ludlum).  I could not figure out what was going on.  The movie seemed to be a lot of this guy (Matt Damon, who does not belong in this role, I'm sorry) running around and making out with this girl.  There was no dicernable plot, no recognizable conclusion.<br />Then I read the book, and was horrified.  I have truly never seen a worse butchering of a book by a movie, except perhaps Girl, Interrupted.  Not only were the characters distorted and flattened and the plot garbled and spliced, the most important character was left out ENTIRELY.<br />Read the book instead. If you haven't read it, you will wonder what the heck is going on.  If you've already read the book, you will want to hit your head on large amounts of concrete.<br />Don't watch this movie.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this cd is the best cd of the year without a doubt
0446677450|2.0|I'd have given it three stars if it had more substance, but, for a purported bestselling financial guide, this book is really just a story about Mr. Kiyosaki growing up. I could easily summarize the useful tidbits of information in this review space but that wouldn't be right. I suspect that the book is more of an advertisement for the Cashflow games. But, to be fair, he does present an interesting perspective on the relationship of Income/Expenses/Assets/Liabilities. Not anything earth-shattering, though. If you've already read any other financial guide, economics textbook, stock or mutual fund prospectus, or can balance your own checkbook this book isn't going to teach you anything new.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Now, from the underground group known as \\"Xero\\" to the new breed of music known as \\"Linkin Park\\", I've been a fan. <br />If you liked \\"Hybrid Theory\\" (2000) Linkin Park's debut album, then I think you will like \\"Meteora\\". While \\"Reanimation\\" was just a re-mix and more of a rap version of \\"Hybrid Theory\\". \\"Meteora\\" has the same type of vibe as \\"Hybrid Theory\\", but in reality is a totally different album. \\"Meteora\\" seems more mellowed out and matured. It seems as if Linkin Park has grown over the past couple of years. I personally thought \\"Meteora\\" was better than \\"Hybrid Theory\\" with such great songs as \\"Easier to Run\\", \\"Nobody's Listening\\", \\"Numb\\" etc. This a great album for any true Linkin Park fans. <br />The exclusive version of the CD comes with an extra DVD and a case that holds both the CD and DVD, with the version of the cover in blue. [pricing] If you want to dish out extra dollars for a DVD that covers the making and progress of \\"Meteora\\" and a new case, that's fine. If you just want a good CD for a good price, just the regular version. Hope this review helps you out, Linkin Park proves they still have what it takes with \\"Meteora\\".
B000069CWE|1.0|This is seriously one of the biggest reasons why this band [is bad]. Look at what they do, they make a cd and then re-mix it. What a stupid way to gain a profit. The saddest thing is; it worked. And the fans. Dear god the die hard fans of Linkin Park are just as bad as the band. You people think this is metal? You are all so blinded by corporate media that you will take anything that's thrown at you as long as it's labeled cool. Get a life. Speak your own mind. Listen to some Iced Earth, that's metal right there. So I am giving you the fair warning; don't buy this cd. You will regret it. Instead buy some Megadeth or Pantera, they destroy Linkin Puke.
B00008H2LB|5.0|You can't compare it to Hybrid Theory but this CD is still 5 stars.  Ridiculous beats and lyrics throughout it, FIGURE 9 is by far the best track.  If you dont buy this CD your a fool.
0151008116|3.0|When I finished this novel, I let out a blissful sigh.  It had all the ingredients of an enjoyable novel for me - animal psychology and behaviour (I'm a behavioural neuroscientist, my everyday colleagues are rats), questioning of ethics in animal welfare, and an exploration of religion (I'm an atheist).  The manner in which Martel propels us through this fable is reminiscent of Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince.  This fantastic tale is essentially a tragedy but like Saint-Exupery, Martel manages to intrigue and charm us into staying for the explosive finale of Pi's unusual journey.  <br />This novel is refreshing because of its subtle and well-executed humour that is neither showy or foreseen.  Pi's perception of the world at the beginning, and his discussions of animal psychology (territoriality, survival) and religion lays a wonderful foundation for the final exposition about humanity.   Pi's mental wrestle with Richard Parker and the interactions between the surviving animals after the storm is fascinating in the initial reading and even more intriguing in retrospect after you have completed this novel.  <br />I wish there were two ratings.  For Enjoyability, I would give Martel 5 stars.  This novel is entertaining and endearing from start to finish.  I burst out laughing several times throughout the novel.  Its charm makes Pi's heartbreaking journey more profound at the end.  As for Complexity and Memorability, I have only given Martel 3 stars.  The metaphors in this novel felt heavy-handed at times and Pi was never a believable character.  There were times when I felt moved by his journey but the premise never felt entirely real.  <br />However, I recommend it on the basis that 1) Martel makes reading fun; and 2) writing a charming novel that is also well received by the critical circles takes more skill than you think and Life of Pi is a refreshing change from tedious but critically-acclaimed novels.
B00005JLZL|4.0|I Think this was a very good movie.  I only give it 4 stars because of some of the scenes..they were meant for teenagers..sex scense and a naked chick i know it was suppose to look like a rape but they could have made the movie with her clothes on ew! But there was good acting..good plot..and a very suprising ending! GOOD JOB
B00008H2LB|5.0|I've read some reviews and have seen people complain about them not expanding their sound.  If you loved Hybrid Theory why would you want them to change anything?  And if &quot;Breaking The Habit&quot; is not expanding their sound then what is?  The people complaining are probably not real LP fans.  They are the ones who jumped on the bandwagon when Hybrid Theory got big.  All the songs are awesome except for Nobody's Listening (too much rap).  We also could have done without the intro &quot;Foreword&quot; and without the instrumental &quot;Session&quot;.  I don't think wasting a song on your CD with an instrumental is smart. I don't know why Mr. Hahn is in the group anyways. Mike Shinoda could just program all the scratching. People will just skip through it just like they skip through &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; on Hybrid Theory.  So really their are 11 songs on Meteora and 10 of them are good.  Sounds like an awesome CD to me.

B00008H2LB|4.0|This is an awesome follow up by Linkin Park to Hybrid Theory.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the CD too short.  That is the only reason it got 4 stars, I would give it a 4.5 if it was possible.  But a lot of new CDS of this genre are around 40 minutes anyways.  Example:  Sum 41, Trust Company.  But all in all, an awesome CD that should be in my CD player for awhile.
0743424425|5.0|The Shining<BR>By: Stephen King<BR>reviewed by: j.y. Kim<BR>period:6<BR>   the book, The Shining, is by Stephen King. it is about a family of three, who stay at a hotel called the overlook for the winter and spring. the parents, Jack and Wendy torrance, look at it as a new beginining. however, their son, Danny Torrance knows tat something is not right and also knows that they are in grave danger. during the winter, te father, jack, somehow gets possessed by the evils of the hotel and tries to kill his wife, wendy, and his son, danny. but in the end, the overlook hotel blows up with Jack in it while wendy and danny is safe outside.<BR>   i liked this book very much. it was very scary and it was a thriller. naturally, i am very fond of Stephen King's books. the thing i like about it is that it sort of, in a way shows how families would act if they didn't get along with eachother. my favorite part of the story was when Jack was going after Danny and saying,\\" Danny, you have done something wrong. come here and take your madicine like a man.\\" i don't know why i like that part but i just do. it is very interesting.
B00001ODHJ|5.0|This movie is great in what it tries to be. FUN.<BR>It is the sequel to other movies of the evil dead series. And my favorite between the three....<BR>Basically Bruce Campbell (the main actor) starts the series as a normal good kid/ student. All the way to this movie becoming a super hero, with no fears....<BR>I definetly do recommend this movie but it needs to be seen after watching the other 2 first, otherwise it does not make much sense...<BR>It is a fast pace, action packed, and demential comedy.<BR>I think Bruce Cambell has proved to be able to act, and should be given the opportunity to bigger parts in the movie industry.
0316666343|5.0|I actually read this book a few months ago, but as I was bwowsing through the reviews I felt like I just had to say something.  This was a great book.  If you are looking for one of those really well written books that nobody likes, (the English Patient, for instance), then you won't like it.  But if you are looking for a novel that will take you out of your own life and into another world for just a little while, and leave you touched and changed, you should read it.  This is a book I will never forget.  I also read Lucky, which was very good.  Lucky was a much darker book and much more based in reality, but I preferred the Lovely Bones.  I thought it was a lovely book.
0385504209|4.0|After reading this and Angels & Demons, I look forward to the next books in Brown's Robert Langdon series.  If you have any interest in Church history, conspiracy theories, art history... even the roots of holidays and common phrases, these are great reads for you.  Brown knows how to hook you, over and over and over... You'll want to start your own research, study the paintings and sculptures mentioned, read up on the Grail legend, etc.  While Brown's writing style is pretty simple, the puzzles in the book will keep you on edge.  I read both, so I see some pretty obvious patterns in his plots... I just hope the next Langdon book is a little less predictable with the arrangement of characters.  Other than that-- this is just sheer fun!
B000001IMX|4.0|Suicidal Tendencies, along with D.R.I. and COC and Discharge in the UK paved the way for punk and metal to mix. This is definatley a great album and would appeal to both punks and metalheads.
0060537639|4.0|I enjoyed Gavin Menzies' Book \\"1421\\"  I am astonished at the level of scorn, disbelief, and discrediting that other reviewers have laid upon Menzies' work.  I am not sure why people would prefer to disbelieve rather than conjecture.  I also am curious as to why these Asian Sailors are refered to as \\"Ancient Chinese\\" and \\"eunuchs\\" all the time?  Surely we do not refer to Columbus, DaVinci, or Henry the Navigator as \\"Ancient Europeans\\" and \\"heterosexuals\\" (assuming that they were).  Is that important to a story about exploration?<br />What I sense is subtle racism: (How could Chinese possibly have done these things?!!!  Preposterous!  Why, the author didn't even consult an etymologist!)<br />I find it quite easy to believe that a civilization as powerful and as vibrant as 15th C. China could have supported such expeditions.  Certainly China ruled the seas in those years!
B00003CX9S|5.0|This is one of the most intense movies I have ever seen.  I must have cried throughout the entire movie.  Totally moving!
B00008H2LE|5.0|For those of you who have waited for Linkin Park's second album and did not get it from Reanimation this is what you've been waiting for. All new songs,including their newest hit &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;. With the enhanced version you can put the cd in your computer and watch a behind-the-scenes video on their cd and a music video.<br />Awesome band. <BR>Awesome songs. <BR>Awesome album. Buy it.
B000002LRX|5.0|i've owned a copy of angel dust for over 9yrs., and yet i cannot get tired of listening to it. from start to finish, it's an excellent album. of course, i liked \\"the real thing\\", but only after hearing this one was i a die hard fan. this one of my favorite albums of all time. a definite must have for your collection. get one for yourself, and you'll see why.

B000002LRX|5.0|I have loved this album, and Faith No More since about 1992.  The ironic thing about all this is that I listened to this album, before I heard all of The Real Thing.  Angel Dust is simply a groundbreaking, rockish, outrageous album that was written way before all this junk that people call real music hit the MTV-laden airwaves.  This is by far Faith No Mores best album, and includes many tracks that simply rock.  Check out the guitar solo's on &quot;Land of Sunshine&quot;, &quot;A Small Victory&quot;, or the straight out heaviness of &quot;Caffiene&quot; and &quot;Jizzlobber&quot;.  I only wish Faith No More still existed as a band.
B00008977N|2.0|I agree with all the other negativ ratings. Just one addition, the DTS Soundtrack is simply unusable.
0553208845|4.0|I became a fan of Hesse after reading his Nobel prize winning \\"Demian.\\" I had been eager to read \\"Siddhartha\\" since a long time. Although the story seemed to deviate slightly from the mythical tale of Gautam Buddha, it was still excellently narrated. Siddhartha's epiphany and journey towards enlightenment had me absorbed in the book till I finished it.
B00005OMTT|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs that I own.  It contains some of Enigma's best songs.  It is missing some of my other favorites such as &quot;Silent Warrior&quot;, &quot;The Rivers of Belief&quot;, &quot;The Roundabout&quot;, &quot;Prism of Life&quot;, and &quot;Camera Obscura&quot;, but nonetheless, it is still a great album.
0140067477|5.0|This book was a stocking stuffer at Christmas. I had never read or even heard of Benjamin Hoff before then.     Intrigued by the concept of Taoism being explained with the help of Pooh and other companions from the Hundred Acre Woods, I started reading this a week after Christmas. I had finished it by next afternoon. This is such a remarkably wonderful book; deep and simple at the same time. It left me thoroughly enthralled, and I have already reread it thrice.     I'd highly recommend this book!

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has spent a year and a half on a follow up to Hybrid Theory and came back with something 5 times as good. A lot of people are complaining that the CD is too short. That's because if they worked on too much material, there would probably be more filler. As you may of noticed, there is not really a second of filler on Meteora. Here's a track by track run down:<br />1. Foreword: this intro is only 13 seconds and pointless. All it is is some hammering sounds leading to the next song. 1.5 stars<br />2. Don't Stay: This is a heavy song with no rap. It sounds a lot like One Step Closer, but has sweet turn tables and yelling from Chester. 3.5 stars<br />3. Somewhere I Belong: the first single off Meteora has great emotion in the intro with the keyboards and great rapping and singing. 4 stars<br />4. Lying From You: Definantly one of the best songs. Has a great keyboard intro. Has incredible energy from the whole band and still maintain the emotion while still rocking hard. 5 stars<br />5. Hit the Floor: A little more edgy reminiscant of Hybrid Theory. Has a great screaming chorus with cool rapping. Great sounding instruments.3.5 stars<br />6. Easier to Run: Sounds a lot like Crawling, but a lot better. Chester really developed his voice and no longer has any scratchiness. 4 stars<br />7. Faint: Another one of the best tracks. Fast beat and rapid screaming give this song an energy no other tack has. Has cool techno elements in the beginning with strings. 5 stars<br />8. Figure 9: This song is a little hard to get into at first, but later it's a great mid tempo song.3 stars<br />9. Breaking The Habit: Definantly a step forward for LP. Again, no rapping, but a great ballad and great beat and melody. Chester's singing his amazing, he goes up about a whole octave in the chorus. 3 stars<br />10. From the Inside: Again, hard to get into at first. Great rap-rock mix in the verses and nice ballad type chorus. 3.5 stars<br />11. Nobody's Listening: This song is my personal fav. I'm not a huge fan of rap but the rapping is amazing as well as the beat and the melody played by some African flutes (probably synthesized). Chester again sings an amazing chourus with a hip-hop feel. 5 stars <br />12. Session: This is the only song I felt wasn't as good as Hybrid Theory. This is an instrumental, but no where near as good as Cure for the Itch off of Hybrid. A cool beat and turntables, but just not enough melody or variety as Cure for the Itch. 3 stars<br />13. Numb: This last song sounds a lot like the last one on Hybrid. Sweet samples and a great hook make this song what it is. It's another rock ballad with great singing by Chester. 4.5 stars<br />Definantly pick up this album!!!<BR>E-mail me with any comments
0151008116|5.0|Whether or not The Life of Pi is a story that will make you believe in God, as one character in the novel asserts, this outstanding novel will make you believe that it IS possible to survive in a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger for 227 days.  Incredibly moving, simulataneously absurd and sad, yet never lacking in credibility, this is a novel that will stay with you long after you have finished reading it.  The Life of Pi is one of the best books that I have read in quite some time.
0452282152|3.0|I'm not a fast reader by any means.  But I managed to tear through this book in 3 days, hour-and-a-half sittings at a time(fast for me, anyway).  I first dismissed this book as a period piece.  It is, but Chevalier keeps the plot fast-paced and doesn't bog the story down with detail.  At the core is the story of a Dutch maid and her working and semi-seunsual relationship with the painter Vermeer.  Not quite as multi-layered as I like from a novel, I was very entertained and had a hard time putting it down.  &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; would be a good start for any book club.  And if you're looking for an excellent follow-up book about a passionate artist try Chaim Potok's &quot;My Name is Asher Lev.&quot;
B00005JLZ9|2.0|The story is set deep in the Panama jungles, six rangers under the command of Sgt. West went on a training mission in the midst of a hurricane, but only two returned.  Basic follows the exploits of Tom Hardy, an ex-army special force personnel brought in by the base commander to find out as much information as possible in regards to the events transpired during that period, before Washington is alerted of the situation.  As time is running out, he must find a way to gain the cooperation of the survivors, and to sieve the truths from the lies.<br />Deception is their most dangerous weapon.<br />Misdirection employed subtly and tastefully can work to great advantage for a movie, such as the ones in The Usual Suspects.  Unfortunately, Basics blatant use of this device is ultimately the reason why the film failed to work.  By the time a third version of what took place at the time of the exercise is told, it becomes so obvious that this account is just as preposterous as the previous two.  Instead of applauding at the cleverness of the plot twists, I often wondered to myself when will they finally get to the point and address some of the loose details previously introduced in the story.  There were some interesting angles that could have been explored further, but apparently the movie was more concerned about uncovering a conspiracy that is both ridiculous and unbelievable.  The funniest thing about Basic is that for a film that spent a good amount of its running time searching for the so-called truth, the premise of the movie was never adequately resolved, and the payoff at the end is as unsatisfying as it is shallow.<br />Luckily, the acting in Basic is fairly solid all around.  John Travolta returns to fine form playing the resourceful and charismatic Tom Hardy.  Demonstrating his versatility in the portrayal of his role, Travolta is sometimes flamboyant, other times humorous, but constantly engaging and a treat to watch. .  Connie Nielsen is likeable enoughas Lt. Julia Osborne, the head of the military police at the base.  However, her character lacks depth and seems to function simply as a way to build the sexual tension between the two leads.  To be fair, Travolta and Nielsen did have good chemistry together, as well as providing the audiences with couple of good laughs.  Basic also reunites Travolta with co-star Samuel L. Jackson since their memorable performances in Pulp Fiction.  Even though Jackson does a decent job as the hard-nosed Sgt. Nathan West, he was not on screen nearly as much as I wouldve liked to see.<br />Basic is a convoluted movie that has one too many twists for its own good.  A poorly scripted plot that made very little sense ruined what could have been an excellent suspense film, something that even a talented cast as this one couldnt save.  Dont go in with a high expectation and you might not walk away disappointed, otherwise, I would recommend you skip Basic altogether.
0425170349|2.0|I've read quite a few of Tom Clancy's books and liked most of them. But this one really bothered me.    The book is about an anti-terrorist group called Rainbow, and describes their training and abilities. We follow them on several of their missions where they demonstrate their talent at putting three bullets into the head of each terrorist in the wink of an eye. You see Rainbow is based on military principles, not police concepts or laws against murder, so there are no silly rules about \\"hands up, drop your weapon!\\" Just get close enough to shoot and then shoot to kill.    All well and good, and I'm sure that if I was ever taken hostage by terrorists that I'd welcome the arrival of a group of highly-skilled cold-blooded killers who would take care of my problem.    The thing that bothers me is that Tom Clancy wants us to believe that these same guys who make their living killing other human beings are loving, caring husbands and fathers, and they experience no conflict between their occupation and their family life. This is apparently very important to Clancy because he goes on and on about what wonderful family fathers all of these guys are. They're all married and all have children and all of them have the wife and kids stationed on the outskirts of the army camp where Rainbow is based.     Clancy describes, for example, how the members of Rainbow feel no regret when they come home from a hard day of slaughter. When wifey, watching the TV coverage, asks, \\"did you actually kill any of them?\\" they brush it off with, \\"you don't really want to know, and anyway, I'm on the side of the angels, remember?\\"    I don't think this is very realistic, to put it mildly. Most of what I've read about Special Forces personnel, and especially the ones who have actually been in combat and killed in the line of duty, is that they make lousy husbands and fathers. Which is OK - a civilized society needs some uncivilized nasties to keep the other nasties at bay. I just don't see why Clancy feels the need to claim that you shouldn't mind having your daughter marry one of these killers.    Clancy also wants us to believe that these guys are intellectuals. For example, Ding, the leader of one of the two Rainbow teams, has a Masters degree, and his wife is a medical doctor! And what sort of daily problems does Ding have which needs great intelligence and a Masters degree? Well, he does spend some time thinking over whether he should do more target practicing with his automatic rifle or his handgun. The art of killing terrorists is obviously something that not just any old idiot can do right!    Another aspect of the book's lack of realism has to do with the fact that being a terrorist killer is not without its risks. At one point two of the Rainbow team members get killed, and we're presumably supposed to believe that their wives and children take the loss of their loving, caring, intellectual husbands and fathers in stride. They died serving a greater cause so their loss is to be accepted. Uh-huh? And why were these loving, caring, intelligent men so dumb that they got into a line of work where there was a high chance of them turning their loving, caring, intellectual wives into widows and leaving their children fatherless?    I realize that I've focused on just one particular aspect of this book, but it's an aspect that Clancy apparently considered very important, and which I found very unrealistic and thus very irritating.    To make things worse, Clancy managed to irritate me in another way in this book. The bad guys in the book are a bunch of environmentalists who have gone off the deep end in their desire to get back to Nature. That's OK, but what I didn't like is that Clancy obviously has no use for environmentalists in general. The good guys consistently refer to all environmentalists as \\"tree-huggers\\" and imply that anybody who worries about the ozone layer or the future of our planet is stupid. A very dangerous and shortsighted attitude.No more Tom Clancy for me for a while.    Rennie Petersen
B00005YW4H|4.0|I bought this CD on a whim, and I'm very happy with it. It's lovely, soft, relaxing music. Norah has a beautiful voice. Shoot the Moon and Come Away With Me are probably my favourite two tracks.<br />I was apprehensive about the copy protection feature as I like to listen to my CDs on my computer but my fears were unfounded. The copy protection software installed on my PC with no problems so I was able to listen to it in my PC-CDROM drive.
0671799320|5.0|This book was a monster! It took me several weeks to finish it. I read it during a flight to DC and several people commented to me on the plane and in the airports that it was a great book. This story is really a story of the twentieth century. It is the story of the rise of the Oil industry. What a mess! What a collection of crooks, crony capitalists, get-rich schemers, and arrogant imperialists! I loved it! Not that I want to be like any of these guys. But it was really engrossing to read. The author really brought the characters alive, and I think he didn't really damn them or worship them. He just told us what happened in a lively and very detailed way. The most interesting part for me was the way Oil was at the heart of most of the geo-political issues in all of modern history. I always knew that oil was part of the equation in historical issues, but to have the whole story revolve around it gave new appreciation for its impact on world societies. The treatments of the World Wars were my favorite parts. But the whole book just gave me a new prospective.
B0000027K7|5.0|I've never written a review before.. but am compelled to step in after reading here that Leslie West was not as technically proficient as guitarist X, Y, or Z.<br />Bull! I saw this band at the Fillmore East, twice, and it was a religious experience. Yes, Leslie's tone is unrivaled.. but his mastery of the instrument is second to none. He is a true virtuoso. I remember at one point, he broke into a solo, playing a dazzling intricate riff. He then proceeded to increase the tempo until the entire audience rose to our feet. There was no cheering though, we were all mute, totally hypnotized by a level of talent that we didn't know could exist.<br />Beyond his guitar playing, West possesses a roaring voice that is the perfect mate for his thunderous playing style.<br />This album may be short.. but it still has more incredible songs than almost any other album.<br />Perhaps the best example of the beautiful contrast between Pappalardi's silken voice and West's screaming vocals is 'For Yasgur's Farm'. It's a gorgeous sweet ballad until suddenly, here comes Leslie! Wow!<br />Other classics are 'Theme From an Imaginary Western', 'Never In My Life', 'Mississippi Queen' and the astonishing acoustic guitar piece, 'To My Friend'.<br />If you like rock and roll, you need this music.

B000002JSP|2.0|And if you've been to my About Me section, you'd see how much I absolutely worship Led Zep. I think it's a tragedy that this had to be the band's last studio album. It's a horrendous, pretentious arrogant piece of excrement. Some people love it, some people hate it, but this is NOT the Led Zeppelin we know and love. <br />It has 3 good songs on it. But each of them is ruined by synthesizers! The overplayed &quot;All My Love&quot; sounds eerily like something Robert Plant might have recorded during his &quot;Principle of Moments&quot; phase (that's not good) and although the song is very sincere (he wrote it for his deceased daughter), it just isn't a good song. &quot;In The Evening&quot; and &quot;Fool in The Rain&quot; are also decent numbers also overproduced and with those damn synths! The rest of the material here, such as the tongue-in-cheek &quot;Hot Dog&quot; and the rambling &quot;Carouselambra&quot; really is an acquired taste. <br />Hmm. If this is what 1980's Led Zeppelin would have sounded like, maybe it was for the best that Bonzo met that big tour manager in the sky!

B000002H6C|5.0|And definitely worth adding to your CD collection. The solemn \\"One\\", about a soldier who's lost his arms, legs and all his senses but is still alive, the title track and \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" are definitely the highlights of this opus. This and the self-titled \\"black\\" album are the only Metallica albums you ever need to own. This is the sound of a tight, motivated band at the peak of its career. Although the follow-up album was good, it was the beginning of the end of METALlica. Then they became ALTERNica. Now they do Bob Seger covers. Go figure.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I cannot say enough good thing's a about fiona and this CD. out of my music library (ranging from Beethoven to slayer) this is the best album I own. I lessen to it every day. if I had a to chose an album to lessen to for an Eternity this would be it. <br />You will not be disappointed i definitely know im not.

0440236738|5.0|There's only one word to describe this book...amazing! Harlan Coben just keeps getting better. My only complaint is no Myron :-) Bring back Myron, bring back Myron....
0780619587|5.0|The DVD version is one disc only. The only special features it has is questions for the director Scott Hicks and Rushes acceptance speech. You will need to turn over the movie to view the features. Besides that, this is an excellent movie about the real life story of Helgott- a musician who struggles with his art and with himself. Many would say this movie is about madness but to be honest with this movie is about acceptance and how not everyone loses their abilities after a set-back.  I would recommend this movie for all musicians.
B00005JLD4|3.0|It is a pity that some people see a fictional account of a story and make judgements. Yes,illegitimate Aboriginal children living in poverty were taken from single mothers and put up for adoption,and this also happened to white children of single mothers. This was the way it was then in Australia and around the world. There were very few single mothers in the 1930's. It needs to be remembered that in the Aboriginal culture incest was and is part of their culture going back 40,000 years. In fact many Aboriginal men have the very same DNA due to the inbreeding of the culture.If a child was found to not have a father,living in poverty and in danger of being sexually molested,then was it not reasonable for that child to be rescued? Recently(and this is a true story),in 2002 a young Aboriginal girl living in a West Australian Aboriginal settlement committed suicide after being sexually molested. Some \\"politically correct\\" and patronising white people had the nerve to say and I quote-\\"we shouldn't worry about incest as it is a normal part of the Aboriginal culture\\" unquote. She wasn't \\"stolen generation\\" and they won't be making a film about her.
0880389052|5.0|This is a book about...<BR> <BR>Drizzt Do`Urden makes an attempt to grow up in a world of darkness. But his heart is filled with ethical integrity. The first book of the outstanding trilogy illustrates how he grows up, and creates things that are always looked upon later. Truly, the first book to this trilogy will remain a classic.<BR> <BR>  I especially liked...<BR> <BR>Drizzt. Drizzt is a believable character, and well-rounded. He completely contradicts the beliefs of his family and most everyone else around him. His family believes that power comes from being &quot;dark&quot;, and it is often proven through their harsh actions. Yet Drizzt is an ethical drow elf, that is better than any other. What else can be said?<BR> <BR>  I didn't like...<BR> <BR>Being the first book, Drizzt has no true companions that play a role beside him the entire time. He is constantly abandoned, and betrayed, creating my mind to go skeptical. I guess it helps develop his character though.<BR> <BR>  When I finished this book I wanted to...<BR> <BR>A friend had gotten me the box set trilogy. Thank God. Because the first thing I wanted to do was read more.<BR> <BR>  This book made me feel...<BR> <BR>It made me look at our own world in a certain perspective. Drizzt grows up in a world where integrity and ethics are commonly rejected. Although, we are not killed or sacrificed for our morals, they are often rejected. After reading the book, (actually the trilogy), I become more of a cynic, even though, to some extent I already am.<BR> <BR>  I recommend this book because...<BR> <BR>It's beyond exciting. If anything, read this book not for it's great literature caliber, but because Drizzt's life is his own.<BR> <BR>  I don't recommend this book because...<BR> <BR>A lot of people aren't into trilogies, or sagas, or stuff like that. In my opinion, I don't suggest reading the book, unless you're up to reading the entire thing.<BR> <BR>  Further Comments...<BR> <BR>R.A. Salvatore is one of the greater authors of our generation. Other books like his Icewind Dale series cannot be taken for granted. Surely, Salvatore's vivid style of writing will live on throughout the days of the future.
B00005JLZ9|2.0|Typically, a good suspense movie ties all it's loose ends at the conclusion. For instance, at the end of \\"the sixth sense\\" you feel as shocked as Willis' character that you didn't figure it out sooner. Not the case here. At this \\"climactic\\" conclusion, you don't know what to believe. An over abundance of plot twists (without reasonable explanations) hampered what could have been an entertaining story line. This was combined with an ending that was so light-hearted and ridiculous, even Travolta sat looking troubled and confused at the outcome he was involved in. The movie's intent may have been to get people talking about it. Here they have succeeded. For with so few concrete facts, the entire movie becomes a matter of opinion. Yet, much like the movie itself, the more you discuss the un-answered questions, the more un-answered questions you find. No doubt upon it's DVD release a \\"directors cut\\" will be offered, that promises to make sense of the theatrical release. So your best bet would be to wait until then and just rent it.
B00005JG6R|5.0|An anime that leaves you guessing untill the very end,A classic style anime that should be in every anime fans collection (if it's not BUY IT NOW)Starts of a little slow but if you get past the first half an hour its all uphill from there.Once again do yourself a favour and watch this even if you don't like anime.
B00005NB8K|3.0|is what this movie should have been titled.  Jim Morrison appears drunk and high in 99.9% of the scenes in this movie which I found dissapointing.  Val Kilmer does a GREAT job as the Doors frontman.  Maybe it's because I grew up in the late 70's, but I didn't really understand Oliver Stone's need to show us what it's like to be on acid and all the while reciting weirdo poetry like Morrison does in this movie...I mean, what's with the indians, snakes, etc? I would have prefered a straight story on the band, this movie is about Jim Morrison.  It's an interesting and different movie that's for sure.  The dvd menus are cool...like something from the 1960's.
B00005JLK1|3.0|I know the end of this movie half way through (and for me that's telling you something.) I guess I've been spoiled by 'The Ring', but this movie's acting was horrible. The opening scene was gory to say the least and the only good part was the flashback.
B000063UR2|5.0|This DVD comes with the theatrical version of \\"Legend\\" and a second DVD that contains the director's cut. The greatest thing about the theatrical version is the clarity and the Tangerine Dream score. The theatrical version is much shorter and sort of confusing since some scenes were deleted. Before the movie begins there is also a screen scroll which explains, pretty much, the moral of the film, which is kind of upsetting. I don't think moviewatchers are so dimwitted that they cannot understand the age-old story and moral. Good is constantly juxtaposed against evil, but the horrific realization that the heroes come to is that good cannot exist without evil. I think most people can understand that without a screen scroll.<br />I suggest watching the director's cut version first. It makes a lot more sense and it contains the original soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith. This soundtrack cannot be compared to the Tangerine Dream soundtrack since they are both so different in style. The Goldsmith soundtrack is more dramatic and thus makes the movie seem more like a drama. The Tangerine Dream soundtrack, with its electronic instruments, makes the film seem more like a fantasy. They are both good in their own right.<br />The casing looks really neat too, and this 2-disc DVD can be bought at a great price.
B000002MG1|5.0|This is my favorite r.e.m. album. I have all 12 LP's and the b-side/chronic town EP in Dead Letter Office. if you have heard of r.e.m. and like them to some extent, then take a risk and buy this album! <br />Everybody Hurts is the best song on this album. It's featured in many movies and cd compalations. Watch night at the rockbury...it's in there. This song clearly will blow you away if you for some reason have never heard of it. Great vocals, soothing guitars, strings, etc. Can make you cry even, but it's simply one of the greatest songs EVER!<br />Another hit includes man on the moon...which you may have recently rediscovered from the movie, man on the moon w/ jim carrey and courtney love. the lyrics are kinda twisted, but then again it's a song about andy kauffman for crying out loud. great sound though.<br />The album starts off w/ drive, which is a great song too. radio hit i believe. it's more of a darker song compared to the rest of the songs, but it simply sounds great.<br />Other musical gems on this album are nightswimming, star me kitten, and sweetness follows. These songs along w/ everybody hurts and man on the moon are sort of precursors to new adventures in hi-fi.<br />Ignoreland i think was another radio single, but i really don't know. If not, it should have been, b/c it's catchy and very easy to sing along to.<br />Overall, automatic for the people clearly sends a message to any r.e.m. fan or even pop rock fan. it seeps into your soul and allows you to make peace w/ any trouble you may have. listen to it, and feel good about yourself, it's worth it!
B00006RCNW|5.0|I have been watching this show since day 1 and there is no better show than this.  I have already pre-ordered season 2.  If you have not seen The Shield yet you do not know what you are missing.
B00008H2LE|5.0|If you enjoyed the sounds presented in their debut album &quot;hybrid theory,&quot; you'll definitely enjoy listening to &quot;Meteora.&quot; Among few minor differences in the two albums is that in Meteora the band experimented with the sound of a string orchestra which definitely compliments the vocals of the lead singer, chester. They have definitely kept the fans satisfied and proven that they still have a long road of success ahead of them. An overall great sounding album with Track 9, breaking the habit, being my favorite.
B0000024SI|5.0|Highway 61 defines north-south movement in the United States much as the famed Route 66 defines transcontinental travel.  Highway 61 runs from New Orleans to Minneapolis/St. Paul.  It follows the Mississippi River, switching across from time to time.  And if you listen to the place names in Delta blues songs, you'll find most of the towns between Memphis and New Orleans somewhere along that highway.  The highway also links  Minnesota to New Orleans.  Say, this is a metaphor for life journeys, for life even.  &quot;God said to Abraham, 'Kill me a son.'&quot;  Quintessential Dylan.  This record isn't for the faint hearted or the sub literate.  My favorite Dylan record ever, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; harkens back to blues traditions in some of Dylan's most exploratory poems and music.  The landscape is surreal and nightmarish.  The vision is dark.  Dylan's wandering boot heels take you on laughing trips down to the blues highway and on a tour of &quot;Desolation Row&quot; with its menagerie of blighted celebrities.  Elsewhere he describes contemporaries living lives of quiet desperation or those caught in traps of self-delusion in &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man.&quot;  Images surprise when Dylan performs his surreal magic, juxtaposing unlike images, behaviors that are at best inappropriate if not downright perverse.  The images stick with you, and sometimes they return as brilliant commentaries on the world that surrounds us all.  Highly recommended.  Listening is mandatory.
B00007BK2N|5.0|I wasn't in Manchester in the mid to late 70's, but this film is brimming with a life that I can only hope summed it up in a couple hours. OK that might be a bit much, but it was great nonetheless. Brilliantly shot by the great Robby Mller as well.
B0000024SD|5.0|Released in 1965, this famous record is where Dylan supposedly broke faith with folkie purists.  I'm not sure what folkie purists those were because I can remember the excitement when this record first came out.  My folkie friends and I spent several hours sussing out the words to &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues,&quot; and we delighted in the record because it is a logical extension of everything Dylan had done up to that time.  As a disciple of Woody Guthrie he'd also learned from Elmore James and Charlie Patton and Skip James.  This record was not the pallid interpretations of the Weavers or redactions of Pete Seeger's tame protests that the folkie purists preferred.  The electricity was real as well and everybody was doing it--Sebastian and the Lovin' Spoonful, John Hammond, Tom Rush.  Protest can't be polite and the blues are not for the parlor.  In effect, this record is doing exactly what the title says:  it's bringing all those essentially American forms and motifs that the so called British invasion had usurped back home where they belong.  Dylan brings blues (traditional and talking), shuffle beats, dust bowl ballads, rhythm and blues back into a contemporary folk idiom.  Wow!!<br />Anyway, this is great Dylan where life is surreal and necessarily paranoid at times and you got to laugh to keep from crying.  And the raw edge is best.  Here we have &quot;Gates of Eden&quot; and &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; as a protests and cautions against the stupidity of war and violence; Maggie's Farm,&quot; which I've always heard as Dylan's musical credo; and the curious promise of &quot;Tambourine Man&quot; an anthem of the '60s.  Remember what the Burger King looked like?
B000002MUN|5.0|I am a big Tom Petty fan and no album he has ever made can match the greatness of this one. Every song is truly a great recording. I have special liking for \\"Only a broken heart,\\" \\"Hard on me,\\" \\"Honey Bee,\\" and \\"House in the woods.\\" Even \\"Crawling back to you\\" and \\"Wake up time\\" are great and still bring tears to my eyes. This is an album that will be hard to put down once you get it. This is one of Tom Petty's best recordings ever and an excellent buy.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Wow! What a killer! It has only six songs, but that's not a weakness on this record. Here, you got no filler : A Farewell to Kings, Xanadu, Closer to the Heart and Cignus X-1 are gifts from above! The two other songs are very good too. <br />Now, let's talk about the musicians:<br />Geddy Lee: his voice is still very high and clean, his bass work is groovy and very clear on the record (thanks to the production!)<br />Alex Lifeson: brilliant. His solos are a must to this album.<br />Neil Peart: He's talented and it shows. The groove at the beginning of Cignus X-1 is a good example.<br />This album is definitely a good place to start a Rush collection or just an opportunity to listen to exceptionnal music from an exceptionnal band
B000065V3M|5.0|Well, as most of you know, the DVD of Ed Wood does not exist right now.  This is a farce.  If ever a movie deserved to be immortalized on DVD, it's Ed Wood.  This is one of the Top 5 comedies of all time and hands down the best Tim Burton film of all time.  Martin Landau gives one of the best performances in the history of American cinema.  Bela Lugosi was a very challenging role (with his drug addictions...not to mention his Hungarian accent).  Landau pulls off the performance beautifully.  Johnny Depp is his usual brilliant self as the ever-positive but often careless director Edward D. Wood Jr.  Another very pleasant surprise in this film are the two comic villains in the wood production company:  George \\"The Animal\\" Steele as Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson, and Lisa Marie as Vampira, a 1950's Elvira.  They both add a great deal of charm to this film and they both look stunningly similar to the characters that they play.  <br />Bottom line:  the performances are spectacular, the direction is flawless, and the story is true...you can't make this stuff up.  I like to think of this film as both a comedy of circumstance about Ed Wood, but most of all a tribute to a man who was proud to be \\"in pictures.\\"
B00000K0DK|5.0|Citizen Kane will continue to reap praise for it's well-planned use of cinematography, lighting, and music.  But even beyond the superb filmmaking lies the story of a boy growing into a man, and the personal challenges he faces.<br />Charles Foster Kane rises from a meager childhood to become one of the most successful men in America.  Yet, even with all of his fabulous wealth and success, he faces the harsh lesson that money cannot buy love, happiness, or health.  He goes to extremes in wielding his power and influence in vain attempts to once again feel the happiness he knew as a child.<br />Many people love this movie for the great filmmaking techniques alone, but the sad story laid out before you reminds you of the importance of focusing on what are truly the priorities in your life.
B00001ZWBQ|3.0|In response to the review from Mississippi, I would say yes, anyone that does not think the quality of the recording is on par with others such as Hell Freezes Over, A Black and White Night, and Live at the Beacon should check out their system....this recording is exactly as the director/producer intended. That, however, is where I take exception.... <br />I own the aforementioned music DVDs and probably close to 60 others. I believe that one of the best uses a surround system can be put to is the playback of a concert video/DVD. You can at least watch them more than twice, which is more than I can say for DVD movies. The price of live concerts is a lot higher than going to the movies these days, making them a much better buy. Yes I have an up-to-date system and have spend considerable time, effort, and money making my environment the best that it can be. For example: Most do not go to the length of getting out the tape measure to set the correct delay compensation due to distance nor do they run test and measurement programs such as ETF5 from Accoustisoft against their setups. So I believe that my system is working correctly.<br />Now to the point: The totally underused center channel will be very disconcerting for the average listener, especially on a DTS disc. The full field front spatial characteristics of the recording do not produce the even concert sound as experienced sitting in the sweet spot at a live concert. Not in the way that Hell does or even the onstage effect that Black and White gives. I really thought that the director/producer would take visual and sound ques into consideration in mix down, but this is not the case. When Celine sings she seems to be coming from the back of the stage, when in fact, she is right out there front and center. There were at least three vocal mics at center stage used to rercord that number, but you would be hard pressed to decide if there was more than one if you closed your eyes during playback.<br />The video qualityis just average, mostly due to the lighting and visual effects present in the hall. The sound is crisp and the bass is full in most cases. Some of the more driving numbers will require that your bass management be setup correctly so as to direct the intensity where it can be handled properly.<br />All in all not a bad walk down memory lane for some of us older types, now that we can afford the gear to reproduce it.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I don't understand anyone who complains about this album's length. Revolver and Sgt. Pepper are considered the Beatles' finest work, and they are both similar to the length of Linkin Park's releases. Now to the album itself. I think Linkin Park has improved by leaps and bounds musically over their debut album. The lyrics however are lacking. Alot of the songs are similar to previous songs on Hybrid Theory, and many of the choruses on Meteora are way too similar too each other in my opinion. So overall this deserves a 4 star rating. If LP improves their lyrics as much as they did their music on Meteora, watch out music world!
B00005JLSE|5.0|As good as this film was, who would have known this film would win 6  Academies including best picture? no one! Catherine did very well at singing and dancing, earning best supporting actress.  Renee did her best and impressed me with her skills.  Richard gere was good but his singing was so-so.  The whole film made up for that so he was forgivable.  The songs were amazing including the cell block tango and \\"I cant do it alone\\".  Must-see, must-buy, and must-watch-again. See it!!!!

It will bring you much enjoyment.<br />I totally agree with other people. He is much better than Tolkein.
B00004Y6O4|4.0|I think the music portrayed the time perfectly, for the year it was released. Our music was changing quickly. He had to plug at least one disco tune.  Turned out pretty good for him. Everyone I knew had that cassette tape.  The remastered is even better. The memories are always better with Rod around! There isn't much that I don't like about Rod Stewart.  Though it was in the disco era, he released this at the right time. A Classic to say the least.

I haven't read the book, nor saw the play yet, but I am really looking forward to it. I'm happy to see that the book has an underlying Christian theme. It sounds great, and I will add another review after I see the play!!!
B000084T18|5.0|one of the best album since pac no need for fast-forwards, and you get a little dose of reality at the same time you can relate to the life storries and if you've never experienced it and know the real life experience then you can use your imagination because its a real life storry.5 stars Dawg do your thing.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I was very surprised at how much i liked this CD. The first song i ever heard was on the russian version of the 30 minutes video. It drew me in and kept me there, and combined with the American version it's one of my favorites on the CD. Clowns is my favorite though, if you listen closely you can hear a russian beat similar to the original Tetris by Nintendo! Sure the vocals sound like someone's torturing mice, but these days with all the hate and hipocrit &quot;music&quot;, mice aren't so bad. The only slight disappointment i had was that only like 6 songs are American and the others are Russian versions of those songs. While it's a good multi-cultural experience, i'm looking forward to more original content.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Outstanding, pulls the original together. Color much better than the VHS version. More intellectual depth than original. Very telling of the times. I have seen the original about 20 times, I was very glad I bought Redux.
B000006YTN|4.0|Cuando Tons of Sobs aparece en 1968, Paul Kossoff y Paul Rodgers cuentan con 18 años, pero como guitarrista y vocalista respectivamente, parecen tener muchos años de experiencia. Por si eso fuera poco Simon Kirke, el mayor del grupo, tiene 19 y Andy Fraser sólo 16. <br />Aparte de demostrar un talento inversamente proporcional a sus edades, componen 8 de los 10 temas (difícil destacar alguno sobre el resto), se anticipan aunque sólo por unos pocos meses al sonido de Led Zeppelin, y lanzan un tremendo álbum que supera a otros trabajos similares de blues rock de la misma época (Ten Years After, Fleetwood Mac, Savoy Brown, Jeff Beck Group). Nada mal para un grupo de adolescentes.
0800141660|5.0|This has all the beauty of a Jane Austen movie, with great photography. Some of the shots are breath-taking. The outfits are well done. There is a perfect mix of romanticism and humor in this movie, and the acting is very good.
B000066796|3.0|When Leopold met Kate? Sleepless in 20th century New York? I wish I could give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars. <br />It's a romantic comedy with a sci-fi twist, which I found interesting. However, the interest slowly died there. I thought Hugh Jackman played the ultimate leading man . . . handsome, suave, easy on the eye (almost forget he was Wolverine in that other movie) . . . The supporting cast, especially the guys who play Kate's brother Charles/Charlie and poor Stuart, were great (in fact they made the movie for me). Meg Ryan was sweet, as usual; but I didn't cheer for her in this movie as I did in when \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" or \\"Sleepless in Seatle\\" . . . Perhaps she played too many quirky romantic heroines . . . who knows?<br />Kate & Leopold is nice and seems familiar . . . but fun and sweet in a strange, sci-fi kind of way. Rent it first . . . then you decide.
B000075BFK|5.0|An avid listener of Tupac can tell that each time he releases an album he better himself. Everytime one comes out it is just something that I must get. Better Dayz I was kind of skeptical about it, but I bought it since I wanted to keep my Pac collection. Well, I am glad I did not leave it on the store shelf. I love every last song on that album. His lyrical skills continually shows that he is more than a actor, he is more than a rapper, more than a performer, he is a lyrical poet. You would think all of his disses would get old. That is completely wrong even though I respect the Notorious B.I.G. (my second favorite rapper)-RIP, his constant lines towards him and the Bad Boy click just gets hot and spicier everytime. A couple of these songs I heard before they came out such as \\"When We Ride On Our Enemies\\" the diss to Mobb Deep and Fugees. In songs like \\"Changed Man\\", \\"Never B Peace\\", \\"Mama's Just A Little Girl\\", and \\"My Block (remix)\\" 2Pac shows he inner side and sympathetic mind. The other songs on the track are just songs that you can RIDE OUT. I would say this is the Best 2Pac album out now... (regardless of how much effort he put into it himself).  <br />Remember this is the 7th Year.. Don't be surprised if he actually comes back.<br />-Krytykal<BR>-Jurrassikk@aol.com

B00008H2LB|5.0|this cd projects a different sound than hybrid theory and reanimation. its more similar to hybrid theory but throughout the album you can tell that Linkin Park has evolved and the sound is alittle different than before. The beats and drums are much better than before too. This is the best cd its worth your money
B00004TJLD|2.0|I ordered this disc, believing the description. This is a 24/96 disc. There is one high resolution STEREO version of the album on this disc. True DVD Audio usualy contains high resolution surround as well as stereo. There are usualy Dolby &amp; DTS versions too. I was disapointed with this disc. Having said that, the stereo high resolution tracks on this disc are first rate.
B000069AUI|3.0|Its ok... just pick up Radiohead's OK Computer instead.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This album is awesome... especially when it comes with a free bonus DVD and a 40 page color book... this album is definetly a MUST!! Linkin Park is starting to grow on me... they ARE pretty good!! :)
0790729628|5.0|I love this movie!  Like many science fiction fans I saw it when it was released, and it was burned into my mind immediately.  The stunning visuals, the moody sets, the more human than human performances, and the multilayered meanings have kept my interest for 20 years!<br />There are many versions of this film out there, and this is one cut that was released at its 10 year anniversary.  Released early on in the DVD craze, it has almost no extras.  The transfer is amazingly well done, but it got short shrift in the way of extras.  LEGEND got a dual disc release, ALIEN is chock full of extras including deleted scenes, and GLADIATOR and THELMA AND LOUISE both got special editions.  Ridley Scott is a willing director to supply commentary, and there are so many scenes and tidbits that could be included in a special edition for BLADE RUNNER.<br />It's worth buying.  But you may want to also purchase the book by Paul M. Sammon to detail the different cuts, and supply anecdotes about the making of the film.  At least until someone rights the wrongs, and brings us a more in-depth DVD.  But in the meantime I cherish my copy of the film that changed movies forever!
B000084T18|3.0|First off let me say that if you are expecting good lyrics or some tight wordplay dont look here.Go pick up some Cormega or Ras kass for that.This album is pretty much a nicely produced hardcore thug rap album.50's flow is laid back and very easy to listen to followed by fellow G-UNIT members Lloyd Banks(way better than 50) and Tony yayo Eminem also appears on this cd as does young buck.I personally liked this album great beats and ok content,A bit repetative but still good.After listening to this album I couldn't help but wonder how it would've been if he would have gotten more personal like on \\"Many Men\\" The rest of the tracks seem to just glorify 50 as a super thug. \\"Patiently waiting produced by and featuring Eminem is a standout track,The Eerie beat fits tha song perfectly eminem easily outshines 50 but 50 came strong aswell.\\"Many Men\\" possibly the best song off the album shows what I hoped 50 would rap more about that real ... not that im a super thug,that im still human song with a chorus that goes:<BR>Many men, many, many, many, many men<BR>Wish death appon me<BR>Lord I don't cry no more<BR>Don't look to the sky no more<BR>Have mercy on me<BR>Have mercy on my soul<BR>Somewhere my heart turned cold<BR>Have mercy on many men<BR>Many, many, many, many men<BR>Wish death upon me<BR>I have to sit and wonder and wish more tracks like this come out of 50's mouth.<BR>\\"In Da Club\\" is A Club Banger and nothing more<BR>The gun happy HEAT is another of the cd's highlight 50 spits raw venom over a classic DRE beat Spewing such lines as:<BR>\\"Dont think u safe cuz u moved out tha hood,<BR>Cuz your mama still around dogg and that aint good\\"<BR>\\"BACK DOWN\\"a forious diss to Ja rule is well put together with the great production of DR DRE again by 50's side this is another good song of the album.<BR>Other ok songs are<BR>\\"what up gangsta\\"<BR>\\"HIGH ALL THE TIME\\"<BR>\\"BLOOD HOUND\\"<BR>\\"21 QUESTIONS\\"(screams 2nd single\\")<BR>\\"Dont Push Me\\"(forget 50 Lloyd is tha future!!)<BR>\\"GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN\\"<BR>The rest off the tracks I pretty much skip all tha time<BR>Well in all this is a solid album with some great songs in it not intellectual at all or smart in any way but then again to ask that of 50 is asking to much.
6305558167|5.0|This is sword and sorcery at it's finest.I have used this movie to exsplain my love of fantasy role-playing games and Wagner.If you have surround sound on your tv,then crank this up!,for Wagner  should be played loud enough to wake the dead.The story of arthur,merlin,lancelot and guenivere should be familiar to everyone above age 3 so spread some culture today.
B000067CPX|4.0|I absolutely loved Californication.  I heard good things about By the Way too, so I decided to give it a try.  The singles are good but nothing else really stands out.  So overall, good but dont expect another Californication.
6304806434|5.0|Nicolas Cage stars in the 1997 Action blockbuster \\"Con Air\\", which tells the story of a Prisoned man who is now coming back to his home on a plane called \\" Con Air\\" that is taken over by criminals including \\" Cyrus the Virus\\" ( John Malkovic).<br />Awesome and entertaining movie that is hard-hitting action at it's finest from Jerry Bruckheimer and on my list of the best movies of 1997. The DVD is stupendous with it's quality picture and digital sound, with a Teaser and Trailer, it's a must own action movie for fans of the genre and you'll have a wholloping good time.
B000089RVX|1.0|Honestly, the only reason that Evanescence is getting so much attention over much better female-led bands is because they happened to be on the Daredevil soundtrack.  To reiterate what many of the other negative reviews have said, yes, Amy Lee's voice is good, but the music and lyrics are [not].  Oh, I forgot, the guitars are HEAVY and BRUTAL like LINKIN PARK!  That makes Evanescence AWSUM!  Whoops, it's actually the same riffs we've heard umpteen times in various other nu-metal bands.  If you want to listen to a truly stuning female-led METAL band, check out The Gathering.
B00008H2LB|5.0|-First of all....36 minutes of LP is better than no LP.  All the songs on this cd are gewd.  LP is doing very well with their OWN sound that they themselves have established.  KEEP IT GOIN!!!  I recommend this 110% and agree that this is the perfect compliment to Hybrid Theory.
0553260111|5.0|Here's some news for all thosed griping about the authenticity of this book....it's FICTION!.  It's a spy thriller wherein our imagination is supposed to run wild.  Ludlum excels at creating moods and the slightly offbeat murky one here perfectly matches the story.  <br />We begin to wonder who the man is, why he is where he is and what his real mission will turn out to be.  Although this may be heretical, I actually thought the TV miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain and Jacelyn Smith was far superior to the movie version with Matt Damon.  When I first heard the casting for both versions I was disappointed.  But Chamberlain was a perfect Bourne, a chameleon, relentless and dramatic.  Smith was much more than a pretty face - she was a great costar.<br />The newest version suffers from an ailment afflicting cinema across the board - the worship of youth.  Matt Damon is not nearly as mature or old as the Jason Bourne in the book. Perhaps that's why those who do not read books enjoyed this version.<br />My only complaint is one that I have with other authors, but particularly Ludlum.  He has been copied so often and with such effectiveness that to be different his novels have grown longer and longer and longer.  I know this story could have used a good editor but I can't think of any parts I would want to cut.
B00006X06U|4.0|the alblum is a complicated musical reinterpretation of her previous work and her voice has as well turned into a masterful instrument.As like all her works ,to truly be apprieciated takes many times to listen .

B00000AFWZ|5.0|AWESOME BOX SET WITH  VERY COOL ARTWORK AND BOOKLET ON THE BANDS WITH PICTURES AND INTERESTING NOTES!  JUST BUY IT! INTENSE 60s MUSIC WITH MANY OBSCURE TUNES!

B000089RVX|1.0|Evanescence offers nothing fresh to the already stale music industry.  Most of their songs seem to have the same boring guitar parts and Amy Lee's voice is boring and not unique.  I honestly can't believe people think their music is refreshing and unique!
B0000025ZF|4.0|I just read the review of a Marylin Manson fan that didn't like this record. Go figure? What are you doing on this site anyway? Please go back to your little world and leave the real music to those who know. Thanks. <BR>PS what ever happened to Marylin Manson anyway? Did he get tired of ripping off Alice Cooper?
B00000DG1R|3.0|Recently looking through my mum's crazy cd collection i found this i thought isn'nt this one of her obsessions as a teenager so i thought let's listen to it. There i found loads of catchy pop tunes in a sleazy 80's coperate way. If you like 80's synth-pop you will love this especially tuns like 'rio', 'hungry like the wolf' and many more but be warned the 86-89 is awful but they retrurn with a good 1993 tune called 'ordinary world'. Overall a good collection of songs.
6300214753|4.0|Along with The Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink, the 80's teen movie craze also spawned Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  The story is deceptively simple, with Ferris (Broderick) bunking off school with his girlfriend Sloane and best friend Cameron and spending a wild day in New York city.  Convinced he's faking it, Ferris' headmaster and sister are desperate to uncover him.<br />This is the kind of movie that makes you wish that the lives on screen were your lives.  Who wouldn't want to press their faces against the glass of the Empire State Building, drive around in a Ferrari or, more importantly, sing Twist and Shout on top of a float accompanied by a marching band?  These are moments that you wished defined your own life and this is helpful because Ferris' philosophising about not missing out on life would have come off as ridiculous otherwise.  For pretty much everyone who's seen this as a kid they will tell you that it affected them in the same way.  The themes of friendship, love and what it is to be a teenager have nowhere been so universally evoked.<br />As Ferris, Broderick is perfectly cast.  Smug, fun-loving and above everything else cool, he's that thing that very few movies seem to have these days - a character you can identify with.  If you like this then it's a fair bet you watched it when you were a teenager.  Ferris Bueller is pretty much a shared experience that you won't be able to explain why it's so, for want of a better word, cool.  Only teenagers will get it and maybe that's the way it should be.  It hasn't lost its sparkle, the ageing audience can't identify with it anymore.  Even better than The Breakfast Club, there's a good reason why this movie has entered to cultural consciense.
0790729628|1.0|Although I'm a Harrison Ford Fanatic, I simply hated this movie. Frankly I don't know what all the fuss was about. If you're looking to spend a few bucks buy an Indiana Jones instead. I would recommned &quot;the Last Crusade&quot; in which Sean Connery Co-stars.
B00005JM2I|5.0|Is what Howard Roark (Gary Cooper) tells Dominique Francon (Patricia Neal) about her fireplace. They're talking about er...marble. This is in a scene which occurs shortly after their first encounter, when Dominique spots Roark and his muscular forearm working at a quarry operating a drilling machine into the stone.  After a long and prolongued silence which ranks among the best moments in cinema, she asks, from her height above the pit: &#34;Why are you looking at me?&#34; Roark replies: &#34;For the same reason you're looking at me.&#34;  And if you think that's a good moment, wait till Roark's  climactic speech to the jury.  Over five minutes long. (What!  A movie audience sitting still through a speech? Impossible!) and absolutely spellbinding.  The film version of Ayn Rand's bestselling novel was directed by the expressionist master, King Vidor, and the screenplay written by, of all people, Ayn Rand.   Who, during a pre-production party  accosted Jack L. Warner and  warned him that if he cheapened or otherwise dumbed down her work, she would  dynamite his studio. She meant it. Jack smiled and gave her a cigar.  The Fountainhead is the story of a hero who wins. By hero, we mean an uncompromising man of genius and absolute integrity. This seems as far fetched to us as Cyrano fighting a hundred armed swordsmen---and winning! (Rostand was a major influence for Rand ) It's clearly impossible.  He's not in Russia, so he won't be shot, it's not that explicit--it's America, he's bound to quietly fade into obscurity and failure. It would be naive to suppose otherwise, so how  can this be a triumph instead of a tragedy?  Thematically that's the question that Roark's alter egos Gail Wynand (Raymond Massey) and Dominique  Francon ask themselves. Gail is the billionare owner of an &#34;Enquirer&#34; type of news rag who rose from poverty by giving the suckers what they wanted. He lives by the credo &#34;Oppress or be oppressed.&#34;   Dominique wants to want nothing, the logical credo of a beautiful woman who is convinced that beauty and greatness have no chance at all in this world. We first meet her as she's destroying of a statue of a Greek god.  She's fallen in love with it and can't bear the pain of needing it, or anything else.  As usual with Rand, these are tortured giants, not the &#34;folks next door&#34; Critics of Rand are right in stating that they are improbable beings. (Name a great man or woman of history who isn't).  Roark does make Conan the Barbarian look like a wimp by comparison. But you see, that's the fun of it. As are her villains, who are NOT romanticized ( forget &#34;Bonnie and Clyde&#34; , &#34;The Godfather&#34; and the rest of zillions of  ever so cool bad guys we've been fed by Hollywood for decades) they are chilling parasites, exemplified in the character of Ellsworh Toohey.  I'ts Ayn Rand, people. Teenage girl sexual fantasies out of Danielle Steele combined with the mind of  an Aristotle!  A strange but wonderfull combination.   And as to Cooper, Neal and Massey, their acting is phenomenal. Perfect casting and flawless directing by Vidor. A true classic.
B00005JLXC|2.0|After \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Spider-Man,\\" \\"Daredevil\\" lets the Marvel side down more than a little; from Ben Affleck's ineffectual turn as the Man Without Fear (not helped by a costume that makes him look, as someone ... noted, like a vinyl couch) via some remarkably poor CGI effects work to banal songs that signpost the action even less subtly than your average episode of \\"Charmed,\\" it's dark, dull and mostly tiresome. <br />Full marks to Joe Pantoliano, Jon Favreau, the boy who plays our hero's younger self, Colin Farrell (though he could stand to cut out the overacting) and especially Jennifer Garner. If Twentieth Century Fox's mooted spinoff for her character makes it to the cinema, I'll be there front and centre; if they make \\"Daredevil II\\" I won't even watch it at 11pm on BBC1.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|With three great albums already under their belts, Van Halen upped the ante even more with Fair Warning. The guitar work(already some of the best ever on I,II, and WACF) is simply phenominal. Eddie Van Halen turns in a career-best performance here, with well-executed riffs and jaw-dropping solos. Alex Van Halen lays down taut drum work and lays the foundation for Eddie's incredible guitar work. Michael Anthony is competent on bass, and although he really doesnt play anything too complicated, he doesn't have too either, seeing as this is mainly Eddie's show. David Lee Roth is his usual self, belting out some good vocals, spoken interludes, and just plain being David Lee Roth.<br />The songwriting on Fair Warning is up to par with the technical performances. The songs range from good(Push Comes to Shove, Sinner's Swing!), to great Mean Streets), to simply incredible(Unchained). There isn't a weak track to be found here(and no, not even Sunday Afternoon/One Foot). My only complaint would be that on some of hte songs the lyrics don't relaly make sense, but who cares when it sounds so good?<br />This is quite possibly the best Van Halen album ever made, and any fan of the band(or of rock in general) owes it to themselves to buy this one.
B000088E77|4.0|The phenomenal ascent of Men At Work had to be seen to be believed. I was present at their Universal Amphitheater concert during one of the first weeks this album was number one, and I saw a group of guys completely taken aback, but genuinely appreciative towards our applause and enthusiasm.<BR>In retrospect, their first album is world-class pop music. It had a definable, unique sound...borrowed from a few sources, sure, but gelling into a wholly original package. The singles were marvelous radio singalongs, but the rest of the album has variety, depth and some impressive musicianship! <BR>The remastering has resulted in the crisp sonic reproduction of a sound that will take you back twenty years, in the time span of a sax break. If the name &quot;Men At Work&quot; gives you any sort of fond recollections, this will be a most worthwhile purchase.
B000002KMY|5.0|After 1980's successful Heaven&amp;Hell, Black Sabbath continued down an almost identical path for its follow-uo, 1981's Mob Rules. The album is a near exact copy of H&amp;H, but when the music is this good I'm not gonna complain. Ronnie James Dio's vocals remain strong(indeed his voice is far superior to Ozzy's) and he continues to lead the band effectively. Tony Iommi's guitar work is great, just as in H&amp;H(somewhere between Ozzy and Dio his guitar style changed totally, and this change fits Dio's vocal style perfectly). Geezer Butler lays some good rythems on bass, espescially on Voodoo. New drummer Vinny Appice is no Bill Ward, but still a very good skin-pounder.<br />The songs themselves are great again(with the exception of the odd E5150) with epics(Sign of the Southern Cross), mid paced tracks(Voodoo, Country Girl) and all-out heavy metal(Turn Up the Night, Mob Rules).<br />Black Sabbath would never be quite as good after Dio's departure in late 1982. Mob Rules represents Black Sabbath at their Dio-era peak, and one is left to wonder about what they might have gone on to do had he and Tony Iommi not had a falling out.
B000089RVX|5.0|After getting aquainted with Evanescence through the Daredevil soundtrack and falling in love with Amy Lee's voice in \\"Bring Me to Life\\" (Paul McCoy rules), I immediately bought this album. As Ben Moody, lead guitarist, said in the video interview, Amy's strong but smooth female voice was the perfect (and only) choice to properly fill out this style of music. And the style... wow.  I enjoy the hard metallica/linkin park style heavy guitar very much, and Ben does an excellent job. However, when this is merried with the moving melodies of piano and occasional strings/choir harmony, it gives a sensation like no other. Add on Amy's angel-like voice on long held notes and again... wow.  For those who say this album is repetitive with the same style throughout, just compare \\"My Immortal\\" with the hard-hitting opener \\"Going Under\\"! Talk about contrast. I am blown away.  BUY this album. Support Evanescence. Don't steal music.  :-)
B00008H2LB|5.0|Why people are trashing track six, easier to run, for it is one of my favorites. It might be sing-songy, but it is still Linkin PARK-esque. every song is great on Meteora. I would say PURCHASE THIS CD AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004TJTQ|5.0|My brother recommended this movie to me, and I am very glad he did! Skip the dog really helps this youngster through some tough times. The more I think about it--the more I am starting to think Skip the dog represents the young boys feelings. This is a very emotional movie, but I would recommend it to everyone.
B000089RVX|5.0|Absolutely Great!  One of the few CD's that you can listen to every song.

B00005JLK1|4.0|The movie had some kinda earie parts and sure it was kinda predictable but hey....I thought it was pretty good. The story line was a little cheesy and it didn't really live up to the standards but I thoght it was still worth seeing.
0060537639|5.0|When I got this book into my hands, I looked at it's thickness and thought \\"I think I'll end up just skimming this one!\\".  I didn't know how wrong I was!<BR>This book is well written and engaging, although it becomes a bit repetative by the end, and will suck you in with visions of grand Chinese ships traversing the oceans of the world and discovering every continent, while the Europeans fight amongst themselves and build ships that would be the size of the support vessels the Chinese fleet used!<br />I am not a fan of revisionist history.  I believe that, to stand here in the 21st century with our concept of morality and fairness and to look back at Columbus (the butcher) or Thomas Jefferson (had sex with a slave) is hypocritical and self-defeating.  <BR>This, however, is not revisionist history in that sense!  As I've described it verbally to a few interested (and more than a few NOT interested), what is so incrediably exciting about this book is that Menzies is NOT a historian looking over the same body of knowledge over and over again.  He is a Naval Officer who has sailed the world and has a personal interest in Cartography.  It was through this love of old naval maps that he began to realize that old European Naval maps were showing land (S. America, N. America) that the Europeans had NOT YET DISCOVERED!<BR>So, from a Fresh and New point of view, he tackles this mystery and uncovers an exciting tale, while mixing in just enough Chinese History to make the reader understand just how powerful the Chinese Empire was and how far advanced it was compared to it's European counterparts.  (When built, the Forbidden City was 50 TIMES the size of London; Henry V had 5000 soldiers at his command, the Chinese had over 1 MILLION!)<br />Menzies is not a historian, and as others have pointed out the evidence is largely circumstantial and very, very broad.  But the arguements and evidence cited is powerful and extremely thought provoking.  <BR>This is a great read, one of themore exciting books I've ever read to get your \\"what if?\\" juices flowing, and I found myself over and over again wondering how *professional* historians could look at the evidence Menzies uncovers and just ignore it and never uncover it's origin...<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B00005JLKN|5.0|I saw this in the theaters and I loved it!!! I saw all of the hannible movies and this one lives up to the standards of the first two.
B00005JL96|5.0|ok.  i was a tiny bit disappointed with some of the 99-01 movies.  but as soon as monsters inc. came out, i was excited with disney again! i am definintely a disney lover!  the only thing i didn't like was lilo in the beginning.  she has a really bad attitude! but i guess since she lost her family and she is so danged adorable she can be forgiven.  the most awesome part of this movie is stitch! he's great!  buy this movie!!! u dont have to be a kid to love it!
B0000524CY|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was when I was eleven years old and to this day it scars ... me!!! I mean this movie scars ... me and I've seen a lot of horror fliks to compare it to. This movie still rocks though.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|one of the classic tales of disney.  beautiful and enchanting.  i love movies which teach values! this movie does it through belle she choses \\"the beast\\"  who has a big heart, over gaston who has a big ego!  it's a fantastic movie for kids! not only kids either! but this movie also leaves out some of the sexual inuendos u can see in some disney movies!<br />definintely by this timeless classic!
B000021XS0|5.0|this was my first d.t. cd, it totaly made me look at music in a different way. this is the kind of music that should replace shallow, superficial bands that are in the mainstream right now. <BR>also, it makes me wish people like britney spears and christina agulera would just dissapear entirly. This cd is so brilliant, i went out and bought all the other d. t. cd's which are also brilliant. Anybody who can appreciate first class musicianship,<BR>great melodies, and crazy jams should buy this cd, and check out the others.
B00004R99L|4.0|ok this movie is not a 4.  this movie is hysterical...if you are under the influence of narcotics.  otherwise, this nonsensical movie has a few lessons but at the same time... everyone is mad!  mean and angry.  the queen is rude.  the cat is rude and just down right mean! I would feel bad for Alice if she wasn't just as rude to her sister!  (or whoever it was reading to her)  overall, i would not like my young children to watch this ( i am only 20 and have no kids but if i did this would not be on their menu)  i would save this one till they are a little older and understand humor and sarcasm. i love it because of it's witty charm, but since disney is supposed to be family movies... gotta give is a 3.75.  bad message for real young kids who just don't get it yet!
B00000ICYE|4.0|Ingrid Bergman and Leslie Howard have made their careers playing exactly the kind of star-crossed lovers who find each other as in INTERMEZZO.  Howard had just finished filming GONE WITH THE WIND when director Gregory Ratoff tapped him to play Holger Brandt, a concert violinist who seems to have it all: a loving wife (well played by Edna Best), two happy children, and a successful career touring the opera circuit.  Yet, behind the surface happiness, Holger sends out subtle signals that all is not well both in his life and in his marriage. His touring takes him away from home for long stretches.  His wife and daughter miss him, and his growing absences begin to nettle all concerned.  He seems to be a man ready for a too-soon mid life crisis.  Enter Anita (Ingrid Bergman) as a piano teacher for his daughter.  Anita is far more than just a child's tutor; she is a gifted concert pianist in her own right.  It does not take long for sparks to fly between them, as each soon has to face the unavoidable question that all adulterers cannot avoid: how can they build happiness on the unhappiness of others?<br />     Ingrid Bergman had earlier played the same role in a Swedish version of the same film with an identical title.  Since she did not know English, she had to learn her lines with the help of language tutors who wisely decided to leave untouched her lilting Swedish accent that had since become her trademark. Both Bergman and Howard bounce off each other in all the right ways and at just the right moments as their characters are basically deeply sensitive to the realization that their new-found love must collide painfully with the near-extinguished love of Howard and Best.  Miss Best, who as Holger's infinitely understanding wife, is not pushed into the background by her far better known actor leads.  In fact, she steals more than a few scenes with an acting style that emits a wealth of emotion with the merest of glances.  Early in the affair between Holger and Anita, Mrs. Brandt sees Anita casually fondling Holger's violin case, and her stifled gasp tells the audience all it needs to know that she knows of the affair but chooses to give Holger a chance to sort out his feelings.  INTERMEZZO is the rarest of soaps.  You learn to care for the characters even as they tread down a path that a legion of other less able films headed.  Good acting will usually do that.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I just don't personally care for the harry potter series.  but my sister a die hard harry potter fan, says this movie is true!  i thought the acting was horrible... but, as far as following the series, this movie hits it on the nose.  brings all those cool things from the book and makes them a reality, i just couldn't bring myself to give the 4th star...
B000055Y0X|5.0|This was a much better film than &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, a film made the same year in 1964 that took the issue of a nuclear crisis seriously.  I thought Kubrick's use of humor to highlight the absurdity of nuclear war was quite effective.  It was rather challenging to make fun of a nuclear crisis.  But at the end of the film, you realize that it absolutely can happen if there are a few kooks who are running the show.  Well Recommended!!
B00005JKCH|5.0|okay.  the special effects are awesome!  i really hope they come out with a sequel to this excellent movie!<br />effects:  5 - heart stopping cool animation and effects make you wish for one day you could be spider man!<br />acting- 4 - all the actors did an excellent job- there was one really corny part.  the kiss between spider man and mary jane.  it was completely 100% corny. if they kissed at all, it should have been at the end.<br />storyline- 5-omg!  i really hope they make a sequel.  i was interested the whole time!<br />overall- 4.99-  that kiss really did a .1 damage to the film!  but other than that this movie is definintely worth buying!
B000059PR5|5.0|I remember watching this on ABC TV in 1984.  I've never been so scared after watching a movie as to when I was finished viewing this.  This is more errie and scary than any other horror film ever made.  This is only because something like this could still happen in our lifetime.  It also gives you a sense of purpose over what you should do to prevent this catastrophe from happening in the future.  After almost 20 years since the first viewing, I still won't see it.
B000065U1N|4.0|josh hartnett really does an excellent job in this movie!  the special effects are awesome and you really feel the losses that the troops incur.  this movie is well worth the money!
B00003CXCW|5.0|I watched this movie 10 years ago and I still get goosebumps!! William Holden is great as the down on his luck screenwriter.  I still get a kick out of Cecil B. DeMille in a cameo performance.  But Gloria Swanson is the reason you should watch this classic.  She should have recieved and Oscar for her larger than life performance.  Watch and be in awe!!
B00006LWSF|4.0|This soundtrack starts with the 2003 Oscar Winner for Best Song, Lose Yourself. But it is not the best song in this sountrack... There is still plenty more great songs... Eminem also presents two great songs: Rabbit Run and 8 Mile... Incredible. XZibit rocks with Spit Shine, 50 Cent seems a great rapper with the songs Wanksta and Places To Go, Nas shows up with the great U Wanna Be Me, D12 has Rap Game, another interesting song... Overall, it is a great soundtrack, for those who like Eminem, hip-hop or those who collect soundtracks. The only boring song is Time Of My Life, it's really bad. But you won't be disappointed if you buy it, I'm sure. A treasure for Hip-Hop fans...
B00004XPPE|5.0|Though I liked Dr. Strangelove more, this film is still a powerful, on the edge of your seat thriller.  Henry Fonda gave an unforgetable performance as the president under fire.  Walter Mathau was also gripping as the cold hearted professor.  There are some well known actors that gave supporting roles such as Dom DeLouise &amp; Larry Hagman.  Sidney Lumet was on a role during that time and would go on to direct some great movies.
0780626966|4.0|Here is the greatest thing for Freddy Krueger fans. This is a box with the 7 movies of the series plus a bonus DVD with a bunch of special bonus. On each DVD there are great trivias in the DVD-Rom features, great sound and captions... If you like this series, it's really worth buying. I don't have to warn you that the movies are violent, blood, sex, guts and this kind of thing, but it's fine, anyway. One of the coolest things is that there are a couple of Nightmare On Elm Street 3D glasses (you use them to see the 6th movie ending). And a booklet full of pictures and cool texts. The only reason I dont give this a maximum rating  is the fact that the DVD-Rom features doesn't work on iMac... Buy it anyway. Great fun! Lock your doors, grab a crucifix and.. DO NOT SLEEP!
0440213525|5.0|I am 13 and I dont love to read. I couldnt put this book down. it was my favorite book i have ever read. It was about a topic that when you think about it, could happen to any of us.  Also it happened to a kid. I would recomend this book to anyone, even if they dont like to read like me. i loved this book.
B000089RVX|5.0|Hard to put words into a review for this band. As a previous review had said, it's like Sarah M. meets Linkin Park. But..who gives a damn? This is great music, ESPECIALLY for a band with a female vocalist.(No, i'm NOT sexist!) But seriously, this band and album are hard to put into words. If you like any of the following bands: Nine Inch Nails, Linkin Park, or even Sarah M., you will LOVE this band. This album is classified as many things, Rock, Techno, and even Gothic Industrial. What do I think? Heck, It's all of them rolled into one big mega package. A perfect description of this band is as thus: \\"A female version of Nine Inch Nails(and maybe Linkin Park), only with rock, no cussing, and a female singer\\" 3 Best songs on the album? \\"Going under\\" \\"Bring me to life\\" and \\"Hello\\" Nuff said, this band RULES! Go buy the album \\"Fallen\\", you will NOT be dissapointed at all!
B000089RVX|3.0|I love this album, even though Im not normally a fan of alternative music. But Amys voice is just too beautiful to pass over. I had been a fan of Evanescence for a few months before finding out they were being released with the Daredevil movie. I have several of their songs downloaded, so I assumed that they would be the same as on the CD. Oddly enough they wern't. Many of the songs have had a lot more guitars added. Even my favorite song, \\"Hello\\", had a choral background instead of the simple piano and strings background of my mp3. Its not all bad; sometimes you just miss the origonal version. :) However, this album is really good, and I reccomend it.
B00004T8RK|4.0|let me first start off by saying that pearl jam is one of my all time favorite bands. that being said, i have to say that this is one of my more favorite albums. like always (as someone else said) PJ has brought together a mixture of all types of musical types, experimenting. and they have done so well. anyone that says that there isn't a song on the album with a \\"hook\\" obviously has never listened to 'light years', which is one of the most beautiful songs i've ever listened to by anyone. i liked the fact that they have returned to writing \\"rockers\\" on this one (such as breakerfall, god's dice, insignificance) but still can keep the ballads as well. all in all this one was definately better than yield pr riot act, but not the best. however, all of their albums are high on my lists because they simply know how to write, produce, and play without the need to be overexposed on MTV and the radio like so many other bands out there today. oh, and to the guy who said that after two listens he was ready to use it for a drink coaster, obviously you aren't a music fan, because if you were you'd know that you cannot judge any album by listening to it a few times.
B00008H2LB|4.0|how many bands make a better follow up album then there first.  ok some do, but most times the original is better.  if you already hate linkin park then why do you review this cd or even buy it or waste your time listening to it, i hate mariah careys music, so i dont waste my time listening to it or reviewing it. ok anyway the cd is good but one big big problem- its so damn short, like 36 min.  theres 3 bad tracks and the forward and the instrumental song [are bad].  out of the 13 tracks 8 are good.  \\"easier to run\\" \\"from the inside\\"  are the best tracks and what makes it good.  i would rate it 3.5 stars but it wont let me.  now that they got this one out of the way, the sophmore curse is over, hopefully they can return to hybrid theory type music soon.
0375414053|4.0|Allison Pearson's debut novel was a surprise to me. I was expecting a laugh riot yarn about a working mother trying to juggle her career and family, not a book that actually strikes quite an emotional chord and presents a heroine that's not always likable, but quite honest in her portrayal.<BR>Kate Reddy is an English woman who works as a hedge fund manager. She's very successful at her job, so much so she hardly gets any time with her two young children and husband. Her witty voice brings to mind Bridget Jones, and her situations, \\"The Nanny Diaries\\". At first I wasn't sure I was really going to like the novel because I found myself reacting to her in a negative light. But as the novel progressed, I found myself having a greater understanding and empathy for the character. Allison Pearson has written an entertaining story that should also provoke some interesting discussions about not just working mothers, but working parents in general.

038572179X|5.0|I have just finished Atonement and am still in its thrall.<br /><br />  This is a beautifully written book, in an age where it seems that the classic tests of good writing have gone by the wayside. McEwan chooses words wonderfully, with a lyricism I thought was lost; he constructs sentences, paragraphs and story into a cohesive whole that seems effortless.<br />  The story is not a mere recitation of the effects of a child's lie.  Like great literature, it allows the reader to learn, and not simply be instructed.  So many books I've read are readable, interesting and some are tours de force. (Corrections comes to mind as brilliant but nearly a waste of time compared to Atonement.)  The theme of sin and atonement is a conservative point of view.  The very idea of having to take responsibility for one's actions (instead of dismissing them as a result of an offended childhood or being misunderstood) seems a little old fashioned.  As presented by this thoughtful man,the very idea of redemption is explored.  Whether it is achieved is up to the reader to decide.  Responsibility in this book is not simply bearing up under the weight of retribution, but a true understanding of the debt created when harm is inflicted on another person. To read Atonement is to understand on more than one level the weight of one's actions.<br />  There are details to quibble with, and individual readers may wish for more explanations of some characters and less of others. The weak and drifting mother, Emily, is presented from her own point of view and never explored by other characters. Robbie lacks faults:  the sinned against is nearly without sin, so Isuppose religious parables can be drawn.  In the self conscious new millenium, the book rarely shows much sympathy for the 'lower classes'.  Lola's childhood self might have been more deeply drawn.<br />  I don't think those quibbles matter.  For readers who want to be fully engaged and absorbed, this is the book. For readers who want to be pushed into thinking about one's own life, others' lives, and how at least one theme of life matters, this is the book. For readers who love to see the language used as an instrument as well as for its own beauty, this is the book.  For writers to need an exemplar of what good writing looks like, sounds like, and how it is built, this is the book.ant to be pushed into thinking about one's own life, others' lives, and how at least one theme of life matters, this is the book.

B00005NWRS|4.0|Ryan Adams is a studio fiend, he gives us the haunting &quot;Heartbreaker,&quot; then just a year later we get this effort. Now, I'm not saying Gold is a bad record, far from it, but in comparison to &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; it doesn't seem as focused, the songs are great but when combined they don't flow well at times. Overproduction seems to reign as well. Adam's seems more at home with his acoustic guitar and a whiskey bottle than a whole backing section. Gold though does contain some gems, &quot;Anwswering Bell,&quot; &quot;Sylvia Plath,&quot; and &quot;Harder Now that's It Over&quot; are all terrific, but songs like &quot;Enemy Fire,&quot; and the dragging &quot;Nobody Girl&quot; detract from the album. <BR>Also, the limited edition bonus disc is terrific, and makes me wonder why songs like &quot;The Bar is a Beautiful Place,&quot; and &quot;The Fools We Are As Men' were ommitted from the record. Still, this album deserves three and half stars, i rounded up for my rating. To compare this record to Heartbreaker or any Whiskeytown album's would be senseless. Adam's has grown into other genres aside from his alt-country hero status. Still, check out this record, its a nice way to try on alt-country to an extent.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This is a must see for every person, whether or not you are a fan of musicals.  I hate musicals and didn't even want to see this, but my aunt dragged me to it and I entered with a negative attitude, hoping it would be over and done with as soon as possible.  However, the opening song \\"All that Jazz,\\" performed by Catherine Zeta-Jones (Velma Kelly), simply shocked me.  Zeta-Jones is truly talented and has a strong, wonderful and beautiful voice.  Her performance really surprised me.<br />The movie went on to throw out other astounding numbers such as \\"Funny Honey,\\" \\"When You're Good to Mama,\\" \\"Cell Block Tango,\\" \\"Razzle Dazzle,\\" and \\"Mr. Cellophane\\" to name a few.  The performances of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renée Zellweger, and Richard Gere shocked me completely.  I had no idea they could sing or dance like that, and every number was so rich with talent and life that I found myself lost in the movie.<br />As Richard Gere said, each song really does have amazing entertainment value.  The music, lyrics, performance of the actors, the choreographing...everything was simply amazing.  By the end of the movie I didn't want to leave.  I have never before enjoyed musicals and while this one does have its old Broadway persona to live up to, it is truly a wonderful movie.<br />Renée Zellweger's musical performance pales a bit in comparison to the rest, especially to Zeta-Jones whose previous musical experience was unknown to many, but she did a wonderful job portraying the star-struck, fame-chasing Roxie Hart.  Richard Gere (Billy Flynn) gives a wonderful performance with his acting and singing, as well as tap dancing which he learned just for this movie.<br />Queen Latifah (Mama Morton) and John C. Reilly (Amos Hart) were wonderful as well, and everyone really did hold their own.  The casting was well done, the singing and dancing (all performed by the actors themselves) is simply wonderful and will keep you glued in your seat and locked on the screen from start to end.<br />A must-see for everyone!!!
B0000636UN|3.0|Well after a string of terrific albums that just seemed to get better and better, it was inevitable that Crow would stumble eventually.  It's not awful, no, but it doesn't hold a candle to the previous albums.  And didn't you get the impression that the company had decided to market Sheryl Crow as if she were Britney Spears?  &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; is such a calculated car-radio summertime hit that it seems outright cynical.
1400031362|5.0|Morality for Beautiful Girls, the third book of the series, just continues to please.  Mma Precious Mamotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni, as are all the characters in this novel are such complete, carefully drawn people that is wonderful to be with them once again.  Mma Mamotswe runs a detective agency but what she really does is help people with problems in their lives.  She looks at life in a balanced and faithful way, and she lives a good life, expecting others not always to do the same.  In this book we see her give her secretary more responsibility and authority and it does nothing but good. I love the way Alexander McCall Smith describes Africa, and I feel like I am there.  This is a wonderful, fabulous book--read it, read the series!  After this, it is to The Kalarai Typing School for Men for me.
B00005YW4H|5.0|How rare and sweet it is, to find that which seems both known and new.  &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is precisely that.  Norah Jones manages to channel the ghosts of Billie Holliday, Ella Fitzgerald, and even Rosemary Clooney, capturing beautifully the blend of haunting seduction, sultriness, and elegance that (for me at least) characterized these prior artists.  Despite this, she is utterly unique--the only artist within sight distance of her in current mainstream production might be Diana Krall.  <br />If you've not yet given Norah a listen, she's well-worth the time.  I usually have nothing even remotely charitable to say about Grammy-winning artists; this marks what may be a once-in-a-lifetime exception.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime artist, and an exceptional talent; if vocal jazz is your thing, Norah Jones just might be for you.  It is to be acknowledged, however, that her own songwriting talent is not particularly diverse.  As some critics have remarked, some number of the songs sound moderately similar: rather than a detraction, understand this to positively contribute to the flow of the album.  The tracks are far from uniform however, and there is nothing here really worth criticizing, unless like some, you were searching for a Natalie Merchant clone.  This marks an exceptional debut effort, and I only can wish I had found it sooner.
B00007ELEL|5.0|A wonderfully funny movie!  Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Julianne Moore do an excellent job.  This one of those movies that grows on you.  Smart writing about characters you know are out there in the world.  If you haven't seen it at least 3 times, you're missing a gem.
B00007H1Y2|3.0|Overall a good album - inventive, fun, soulful - but there are weird moments of cheesiness tossed in.
B000002TQV|5.0|Fantastic album.  Searing guitar riffs mixed with emotionally charged vocals and lyrics.  From the hard-edged rock of \\"Bones\\" and \\"The Bends\\" to the melancholy of \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and \\"Nice Dream\\", every note is just perfect.<br />Radiohead followed this up with an even better album, OK Computer.  Less raw and rocky, more ambient and symphonic, it just grows and grows on you.<br />Now if Radiohead would kindly get back on track after wandering off to do the very mediocre and forgettable \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Kid A\\", and the mostly forgettable (though with some evidence of a slight return to form), \\"Hail to the Thief\\", the world would be a better place.
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine Dion was definitely already a well established star vefore this album. She was coming off the successful &quot;Colour of My Love&quot; album which had gone multi-platinum and given her her first #1 hit with &quot;The Power of Love.&quot; But it was &quot;Falling Into You&quot; which made her a worldwide phenomenon. It gave her three monster hits which weren't only huge hits at adult contemporary *as most of her singles are* but they were all huge on pop radio too all making the top 5. &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot; kicks it off with its original extended version. Celine's vocal performance is amazing and it's an epic song if ever there was one. &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; became Celine's biggest hit to date going to #1 and has became a classic love song. &quot;All By Myself&quot; definitely stands out and is one of my favorite Celine tracks. She belts it out like there's no tomorrow and the composition is outstanding. Still, the highlight is without a doubt &quot;River Deep Mountain High&quot; which was originally done by Tina Turner. The song itself is icredible and it definitely displays Celine in her element. A classic. It's worth buying the album alone. But what makes this album so great is the filler is just as good as the singles. &quot;Declaration of Love&quot; is a fun sort of jazzy, upbeat track. &quot;I Love You&quot; is a 50's-ish ballad with sweet vocals from Celine and &quot;Call the Man&quot; is a gorgeous, catchy ballad with a great chorus. The album closes with &quot;Fly&quot; dedicated to Celine's niece who passed away from cystic fibrosis. A beautiful tear-jerker.<br />This is a land-mark album in pop music. It represents everything that makes it so great. There is no excuse to miss out on such a great piece of work. Great work from one of the best voices in music history.
B000002ULO|5.0|This is one of the best albums I own.  The music has that timeless Paul McCartney quality that we all know and love.  Each song is its own gem.  I highly reccommend this album for old fans of Paul, and those who may just be learning of his gift.  A superb album!
0385504209|5.0|I picked this book up from the library because I am intensely fascinated by da Vinci and the inside jacket synopsis hooked me to give it a try. I've never read any type of suspense/mystery book. This was my first one. Well now I'm afraid to read another and find that I've just read the best and there's nowhere to go but down. I have never read a book as quickly as I read this one. Now, I'm pushing this book on all my friends/family. I even bought it as a present for my Dad.<br />The twists and turns are very unpredictable and I am very good at figuring out what is &quot;around the corner&quot; before it is revealed. So there is an immense sense of anticipation as you read it. The puzzle element of the book is good and it feels like you are reading an adventure game like Myst or Longest Journey. I would try to figure out the puzzles before the solution was revealed (of course, falining miserbly b/c they are ingenious).<br />And finally, the research and the fact that there is some veridicality (the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei, the surprise in The Last Supper, the Beloved Disciple, etc) were jaw dropping for me. As I read the book, I would go on the Internet and look up things that Dan Brown wrote about and found that there is some support for the things he discusses. As a Roman Catholic, these revelations were mind-blowing and has made me more interested in the history of the Roman Catholic church.<br />This book is definitely a must-read. As I already do, I would recommend it to anyone. I definitely plan to make this book a permanent part of my collection. I also think it would make an excellent movie. Christopher Nolan, the director of Momento and Insomnia would do this book justice.

B00008H2LB|2.0|I USED to be a very big fan of Linkin Park, but I have to say that LP has gone down the gutter...<br />The only track I enjoyed was Hit the floor, but even that wasnt all good<br />My advice to Linkin Park would be to stop trying to be like Korn and trying to rap...<br />Hybrid Theory was much better then this
0792839749|5.0|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is one of the best movies ever made.<BR>It is on dvd now in all it's glory. Ignore the Amazon editorial review which was obviously written by someone who disliked the movie entirely- perhaps they are too young to appreciate the splendor of it as they stated it was too long, out-dated, lacking special effects,etc. See and hear for yourself the delightful wonders that Hollywood used to make.  Unlike the most recent movies made by Hollywood in the past decade -high budget disappointing typical movies filled with high-tech special effects yet no decent story at all ! By comparison Chitty Chitty Bang Bang holds it's own based solely on a great script, superb acting, songs that make you want to sing along, dancing that makes you wonder \\" how can Dick Van Dyke dance like that ?\\" with action,comedy,adventure and a love story all thrown into this family film. Who could ask for more ? They just don't make'em like this toot-sweet story anymore !
B000084T18|5.0|This is great. Not 2pac, but good. Eminem, Dr. Dre also appear in this ...album. G-Unit isnt bad, would rather have more Dre & Eminem. Great songs; my favorites being every one not put on the radio. Once a song goes on the radio, I dont want to hear it any more, people walking around going.. Go shorty its yo birthday... It pisses me off. This is a GREAT album though. Go buy it NOW, you will like it if you like Dre and Eminem, no crap Jay-Z or Clipse; they just talk and talk, nothing has ever happened to them. These guys have great potential, but please release songs that wont be radio edited! Once they are radio edited people sing them WAY to much and are overplayed and nobody likes them any more.
0385508417|4.0|No lawyers, no murders, no theft, no drama. Well, some drama...brought on by our protagonist, Luther. This is a fun, sweet, quirky read that somehow had me rooting for Luther and his plan to skip Christmas altogether, even though he came off sometimes as a jerk; quite the accomplishment for the writer. I have always liked Grisham's work, and this is a completely different sound for him. All poor Luther wants to do is avoid the trappings of the holiday. But in the classic &quot;no man is an island&quot; sense...it won't be easy for him to explain his sudden departure from the holiday to his friends and neighbors. The twist at the end was the clincher for me...and made me decide that this little read was a delight.  Don't wait until Christmas to check it out.

B00004XONN|4.0|When Radiohead finished recording, touring, and promoting Ok Computer they were sick of being Radiohead. So they entered the studio, stipped away any memory of a past self, and built themselves from the bottom up once again. The result was Kid A. <br />Undoubtedly one of the best albums of the year, it shocked fans at first listen because it sounded nothing like the Radiohead that swept the world over with OKC. They had created a sonic adventure that was unprecedented. They created a classic. <br />Through Kid's 10 tracks the listener is taken through a starry landscape (&quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; -&gt; &quot;The National Anthem&quot;) and brought back to ground in crashing fashion (&quot;In Limbo&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot;) while never leaving the home base. <br />I've never seen neither a  shooting star nor the aurura borealis but if/when I do, I hope I'm listening to Kid A.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am a huge Miyazaki fan but this one was just amazaing, his best work yet personally.I read soem other reviews saying they didn't like it because it scared their children and it was too weird. Its true this movie has a lot of scary parts and some people said it was \\"dark\\" which it isn't at all!Its truly a beautiful movie but I would reccomend your child would be 10+up for some parts even freaked me out.Amazing Animation, but some people said\\"the characters were to mean\\" such as her parents\\"they yell too much\\" one person said. You can hardly call them yelling its true they wern't perfect parents liek in some others and they did care about Chihiro but theyre like most parents in my hoem town they don't really care what their children do so they seemed real to me.\\"Yubaba was too cruel\\" When her baby was goen she worried like a real mother you have to expect her to get angry ,wouldn't you if your child((if you don't have a child just pretend))) went missing, she was just worried and seriously after Sen ((Chihiro)) cleaned the Stink Spirit she started to appreciate her more, and ok soem characters such as HA-Noshi((No Face)) might scare soem children I thought he looked creppy before I saw the movie but now he's my favorite character and by the end he wasn't truly evil and personally I never thought he really wanted to hurt Chihiro.I'm not doing this to complain to people who don't like it i'm just saying open your mind and see the beauty of this movie such as the part when Haku remembered who he was, and if you think the characters are cruel remember Zeniba's kindness towards Sen and No-Face, and how even though No-Face attacked her she tried to help him, also remember the comedy parts in it \\"seriously they are hilarious!\\"AND ITS ON OVER 90 TOP TEN LISTS!THAT HAS TO TELL YA SOMETHING!Pretty much this is a great movie which even beat his previous movie Mononoke Hime((second fav!!!)).
B000002G7G|5.0|The Velvet Underground, possibly because of the constant change in the band's roster, created four (technically five) studio albums that all manage to sound very different and distinct from each other.  This album is my favorite VU album because it seems that a brief, brilliant equilibrium was achieved.  This album has characteristics of all the other albums; it has some of the art-house sensibilities of VU &amp; Nico, it has the ragged experimentalism of White Light/White Heat, and it has a bit of the pop song sound that make Loaded so much fun.  Though it has the best qualities of each album, it stands on its own as a distinct stage of the band's career.  John Cale had just departed, Doug Yule had just joined, and this would be the last album that Maureen Tucker had a hand in.  The songwriting talents of Lou Reed finally take center stage, perhaps because of Cale's departure and the unique talents he brought to the Velvets. More than anything, this album is a collection of well-crafted rock songs that only could've been made possible at this stage of their career.
B000066C1N|5.0|my mom saw the movie and said she really wanted the soundtrack so i got it for her. she said that the soundtrack was wonderful so i gave it a listen. it was beautiful with each song shining on it`s own. the lyrics are beautiful and sincere. the vocals are outstanding.
B000002KKK|5.0|Three years seemed like a long time to wait for this album and fortunately there are good songs on it. My favorite is probably \\"Lowdown in the Street\\". \\"A Fool for your Stockings, Manic Mechanic, and \\"Esther be the One\\" are standouts.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I'd like to first of all say that this is very good, as I&quot;m listening to it right now I think its excellent, some hip-hoppish songs and some sort of metal and hard rockdeffinately good though. check out those new LP DC shoes definately awesome.
B000002G7E|4.0|Its supporters call it an avant-garde masterpiece, its detractors call it horribly unlistenable, and the truth is probably somewhere in between.  White Light/White Heat, more than any other of its time, points ahead to the punk movement in New York that was just around the bend.  But this album is more crafted than a Ramones album, there are more ideas amidst the ferocity than most punk albums that would emerge in the 70s.  <br />This album stands out even more when compared to the music that was popular at the time.  A far cry from the hippie movement that was so predominant at the time, this album certainly stands out as the ugly duckling of the 60s.  But perhaps it are these differences that make the album still sound so fresh 35 years down the line.  <br />If you like your music raw, with ragged edges and everything hanging out, you will probably appreciate the intensity of this album.
0517220784|4.0|Anyone who is at least moderately interested in mystery stories should make an effort to make themself familiar with Sherlock Holmes.  It is widely known that Holmes is one of the best fictional detectives ever, but it it surprising how many people have not actually read any of his stories.  The Gramercy Books edtion of the Complete Sherlock Holmes (ISBN 0517220784) is probably the best deal as it is the cheapest hardcover edition I have been able to find (Holmes deserves hardcover).  This is definitely a book that any self-respecting mystery lover will locate on his shelf.  One small note is that the print is a little on the small side (newspaper size) and is in two columns, but this merely allows the book to avoid being an oversized monstrosity like some other editions are.
B0000024RQ|5.0|Bob Dylan is a genius. Period. If you listen to tracks such as &quot;Blowin' In the Wind&quot;, &quot;Masters of War&quot;, and &quot;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall&quot; you can hear that the lyrics are as meaninful as they were in the early '60s. The songs are some of his best of his entire career and there is a large variety from &quot;Girl From the North Country&quot; to &quot;Bob Dylan's Blues&quot;. Overall one of my highest recommendations to anyone interested.
B00008H2LE|5.0|this is got to be one of the best albums i bought this year so far it deals with the dark emotions that every one has and sheds some little as well. i would recommend this album to any one who liked hybrid theory its the best second album i've heard from a band lately
B00008BXJF|3.0|I bought this album a few days ago being surprised seeing it in the store. I just thought - wow! KC released a new studio album and it didn't take them ten years for that, so I bought it automatically. Now, this is my personal opinion and all of youz fans (I'm still one) shouldn't take this as a dramatically bad review, but most of the album bored me like nothing has in years.I'm actually fond of all KC incarnations, and I like te 80's+VROOM era very much. Despite al the ProjeKcts (some are interesting some are NOT), during the past decade KC was actually slowly returning to their prog-rock roots from the Larks'tongues years, slowly drowning Belew's pop sensibility and this 50/50 combination worked excellently with &quot;Thrak&quot;. &quot;TCoL&quot;, issued seven years later continued developing the sound of the instrumental tracks of the previous album, combining it with revised interest in the mid-70-s KC music, and not very much with the ProjeKcts (except very little for the batterie and ambient sound). In the meantime two of the innovative and imaginative members left, leaving their places to a Fripp-enthusiast bass player and (don't take it personally) a hard rock drummer. Like the previous one, &quot;TPtBI&quot; is a continuing revision of Thrak+Larks'Tongues jamming (larking, thraking). This gets a little boring, exellent musicianship too compact, not a drop of humor or self-criticism, only elitistic self-reference in playing serious music. Due to songwriting the album sounds like it was recorded in one dark evening after which the band had a cronic collective headache. The result is almost absolutelly uninteresting - that's all. I give it three stars only in the case I change my mind later, but I'm not so sure about that.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|It's sad to hear Cash's voiceon this CD and compare it to earlier Albums, however time has not detracted from the power of those vocals and perhaps has even enhanced it. Even with his voice fading Cash is still able to trasmit incredible feeling in his songs. This CD is on the melancholy side with a good number of reflective songs or songs involving death. A particular favorite of mine is \\"A Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" in which Fiona Apple's fresh vocals provide a nice constrast to Cash's harsh voice. Also particularly notable is \\"Hurt,\\" a remake of a 9 Inch Nails song. If you are a Johnny Cash fan, or even just a music fan in general, this CD is definitely worth purchasing. Unfortunately, purchasing this CD may be the only way you will get to hear it as country stations around the country have stopped playing Cash in recent years.
B00008H2LB|4.0|as we all know, Hybrid Theory was one of the biggest selling albums of all time. And it just happens to be one of my favorite albums ever as well. With Meteora, they ALMOST succeed in pulling off the impossible and being better than Hybrid Theory. Let's look into it, shall we?<br />Skipping past the intro:<br />2) Don't Stay: Papercut is my favorite Linkin Park song ever, by the way so, of course, the first real song on the album rules. This song is very hard hitting, showing off the harder edge of Linkin Park. Definitely a song to check out. 9/10<BR>3) Somewhere I Belong: The first single off of Meteora, i'm also among the minority that thinks it's not among the best songs on the album. While it is a great first single, it's just not my cup of tea. 6.5/10<BR>4) Lying From You: Ah, thank you Linkin Park. This song is amazing, it's the song i've listened to most and it reminds me of Papercut in a way. Best song on the album. 10/10<BR>5) Hit The Floor: I love the opening to the song, Mr.Hahn knows his stuff. I love the chorus as well. The end of the song is pretty good, too. Overall, great song. 8.5/10<BR>6) Easier To Run: I don't really like this song that much. I guess I have to get used to it. Chester Bennington is DEFINITELY a good singer but I don't like the actual song that much. 5.5/10<BR>7) Faint: Arguably the fastest song Linkin Park has ever made, it is also among their best. It's a nice change to hear a fast beat in an LP song. And listen to Mike Shinoda's rap on this song. Un-be-lieveable. Second best song on the album behind the unconquerable Lying From You. 10/10<BR>8) Figure.09: The beginning sounds eerily familiar to the One Step Closer remix sound but it quickly turns into a One Step Closer clone, kind of. The chorus, however, is amazing. 7/10<BR>9) Breaking The Habit: This song could have been better, honestly. It's good but, I mean, it's not as good as I heard it is. But that Orchestra..it makes this song. 7.5/10<BR>10) From The Inside: It took me awhile to get used to this song but, now that I have, I love it to death. My December was a GREAT ballad and From The Inside nearly equals My December's greatness. 8.5/10<BR>11) Nobody's Listening: That japanese flute gives this song a serious Kung-Fu/Martial Arts feel. And, yes, I like that. I don't usually like Rap songs but this one works. Mike Shinoda's best rap after Faint. 8/10<BR>12) Session: The token instrumental on the album, but DEFINITELY not on par with the amazing Cure For The Itch. 5/10<BR>13) Numb: This song was great..when it was Pushing Me Away. This song is good, but it just sounds too much like Pushing Me Away for me to really appreciate it. But Chester's singing..WOW. 6.5/10<br />While this album is great, it just doesn't approach Hybrid Theory. 4 1/2 stars for a great harder-edge Linkin Park album, but not one of Hybrid Theory quality. And please, to all of the people that are saying that every song is like the ones on Hybrid Theory(not just some, the people who say EVERY SINGLE SONG), please shut up because, once you get past that hurdle, you have some amazing music ahead of you.
B000002540|4.0|I can't really add to what's been said here - it IS (probably) the greatest live album I've ever heard.  But every copy of the CD version of this album I've ever heard has this loud unnatural hiss just before &quot;7 Screaming Diz-Busters&quot;.  That's not a tape hiss, because I never heard it on the LP version.  It would be so nice if they could remaster this, then it would get the 5 stars it deserves.
B00007JVBI|5.0|Chan Marshall just keeps getting stronger as a musician and lyricist. Perhaps as a parallel to the album title, the melodies are alarmingly simple and sometimes child-like, but the lyrics are mature and confident.<br />Stand-out tracks include &quot;Speak For Me&quot;, &quot;Fool&quot;, &quot;Maybe Not&quot;, and the instant classic &quot;Good Woman&quot;. There's only a couple &quot;throw-away&quot; tracks which fail to support the overall mood: &quot;Names&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot;, but they are still better than most crud you'll hear on popular radio.<br />Long-time Cat Power fans will loves this album, and new Cat Power fans will hunger for her back catalog. May I recommend &quot;What Would The Community Think&quot; (another masterpiece) and &quot;Moon Pix&quot;. Happy listening!
B00004Z459|3.0|Theres no doubt about it, Hybrid Theory is a purposely radio-friendly and mainstream album, and 90 percent of its fanbase are 15 year old kids. Nevertheless, the tracks on the album are undeniably catchy and addicting. So catchy in fact, that they will be repeating over and over in your head after listening. So if you can stand the whole 'nu-metal' thing, and you don't take this album too seriously, then you'll definently find enough entertainment here. Thumbs up. <br />Best Tracks: &quot;Crawling&quot;, &quot;In the End&quot;, &quot;With You&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot;.
B00008NRI8|3.0|Chick flicks. A staple in American society and a painin .... But now comes one I almsot enjoyed. Sandra Bullock, great character actor, never breaks pace in this film.<br />I saw this movie in the theater with two girlfriends. One was almost as bored as I was. And the other was laughing the whole time. I think I laughed a total of once, but maybe it was because I didnt want to be seen as liking these types of movies.<br />Story is halfway interesting but even more predictable, which is becoming a trend in Holly wood these days for some reason. Hugh Grant is a great actor and a very funny guy all the way around.<br />So, the film loses a star for being what it is, a chick flick... but it loses another for lack of laughs.
B00005V1Z0|5.0|I really liked this film. I liked it so much I went to se eit in the movies twice. TWICE! And I had to sit thee with ... 12 year old boys and was about to get into a debate with them on the veracity of Ms. Jolie's...eeeeeehhhhhhhh..........endowments. She is a beautiful woman. Beautiful in not simply an exotic way, but a naturally exotic way. She also seems like an actress who is comfortable with what is going on around her. I've seen her in a couple of movies and she seems very comfortable with the sihft from romance to thriller to action hero. The plot is a little convoluted in the sense that it goes really far out on a limb about the Illuminati and the alignment of planets. That was a little hard to believe. That a society could exist for only one moment in time. If maybe this happened every 50 years, that might've been more believable and the time traveling was handled nicely as more or reality altering than true going back.<BR>The action scenes are great particuliarly the aerial fight when theives break into her mansion. I have to admit that I haven't seen anythign like that in quite some time, it was amazing and one of my all time favorite action scenes for teh amoutn of stuff going on, as well as the inventiveness of it.<BR>There wre points where the soundtrack was annoying loud and brash but it does really work well with the film.
B000002BFZ|5.0|I have every Pearl Jam album except for Binaural and must say that this is much better than the rest of their stuff. it has lots of diversity, a nice original feel that is rare in modern rock, and most importantly, amazing songs. &quot;Hail Hail,&quot; &quot;Smile,&quot; and &quot;Habit&quot; are excellent to rock out to, &quot;Who You Are,&quot; &quot;Present Tense,&quot; and &quot;I'm Open&quot; make for great experimental tracks, and &quot;Off He Goes,&quot; &quot;Sometimes,&quot; and &quot;Around the Bend&quot; provide for some excellent calm ballads. Make no mistake; this is one of the best 90's rock albums I've heard in a long time. If you are new to Pearl Jam, I'd reccomend starting with Ten, which conains the songs that made them famous, but anyone who has an appreciation for this band's music  will fall in love with this album. <br />This gets nowhere near the regognition it deserves.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is, by far, the oddest band that I have ever heard in my entire life.  Their riffs never really go together, their music does not connect most of the time, eighty nine percent of the time the lyrics don't make any sense, and often the melodies just turn out to be weird with no particular cause.  However, the riffs sound great, the music sounds great, and the lyrics do have a meaning, despit the fact that they have no cause.  I would not label these guys metal or alternative rock, nor would I categorize them as pop-rock or punk, or even grunge or techno.  Tool has, single-handedly, created a completely different kind of music, rising above the dug in niche of typecasting everytime they come out with a new album.  This band is amazing, surprising, original, and great.  You can't put Tool's music into a certain Genre, it's impossible and nearly criminal to even think about doing so.  If you don't believe me, listen to Lateralus and make your own opinion.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's 'Nevermind' effort, the band's second recording released and major label debut defines the perfect rock and roll recording. It has all kinds of elements mixed together to create an atmospheric and memorable listening experience for rockers of any genre. Nirvana blends a classic rock style fused with heavy metal and keeps the melody stable and addicting like any great punk rock song. Kurt Cobain's musical genius and influencial songwriting skills combined with Dave Grohl's masterful percussion and Krist Novoselic's intelligent bass abilities make such tunes as 'Come As You Are' and 'In Bloom' essential rock standards for every generation. Lesser known gems like 'Breed' and 'Stay Away' should also get huge recognition as grunge milestones that paved the musical landscape for countless bands we enjoy today. Let's not forget about the two epic tracks of the album, 'Lithium' and the brilliant masterpiece called 'Smells Like Teen Spirit.' They became rock and roll anthems, permanently placing Nirvana in a position as future rock and roll hall of famers. 'Teen Spirit' is and will always be my favorite song of all time, I don't care who thinks differently. The other tunes of 'Nevermind,' unnoticed greats like 'Polly,' 'Lounge Act,' and 'Territorial Pissings,' including more are all hit singles to any Nirvana fan. 'Nevermind' is a musical masterpiece that will never grow old. It stands as the greatest piece of music ever recorded. If you do not own a copy, get out there and purchase one or two of 'em right away. You are truly missing out on such spectacular musicianship and great rock and roll. Buy it as soon as possible, I'm telling you. You will not regret owning such a gem of musical content.
B000068QY7|4.0|And for anyone who hopes Oasis will make Morning Glory and DM over and over again should just pretend that Oasis split up after WTS(MG) and never put out another record.<BR>If our favorite musicians replicated the same formula every time it would get stale and boring, both for us as listeners and them as musicians. There would be no point in making music in that case.<BR>Having said that,Heathen Chemistry is the best record they've made since Morning Glory because there is renewed passion for the music in the songwriting and the playing. I love this record from top to bottom, I never skip a track and I sing loud and clear with every tune when it's playing in the car. Oasis has always been about feeling good for me, and listening to this record makes me feel good. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall strength of the album. Little by Little is my favorite track, but I love Force of Nature and I think Songbird is a brilliant track, something totally unexpected from Liam, a huge step from Little James on STOTSG. Anyone who listens to Oasis will hear the Beatles influence, but anyone who truly knows the Beatles repertoire as well as the Oasis catalogue won't make such broad generalizations about rip-offs. Someone with such knowledge will hear the record for what it is: a great new record from Oasis that demonstrates the changes people experience in life as they get older, get married and become parents. This record can also be recognized for what it isn't: an attempt to be the Beatles or a replication of Morning Glory. Oasis has always put out records with great melodies and lyrics I can relate to about rea life and this one continues that tradtion.
B00005JLK1|3.0|OK, I am a fan of horror films.  I am even a fan of blood and gore and the whole gross-out factor.  But I wasn't exactly \\"head over heels\\" for that opening sequence.  It was almost too much, even for me.  Yes it was very well done, a little unblelievable but effective just the same.  Definitely not for the squeamish.  Beyond that, a few jumps and scares, but not as many as I had hoped for.  A few laughs, some intentional, and others from sheer stupidity.  The one really cool scene that no one seems to talk about is the ballroom scene with Isaiah Washington, where the eroded ballroom restores itself completely new again.  Great cinematography.  As for the ending, everyone complains, but the truth is, I don't really even remember the ending.  Apparently it's not a memorable one.  But if you're gathering with friends for a few \\"eews\\" and snickers, it's a decent film.  Rent before you buy.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album rocks beyond believe, From the hard rocking single &quot; Bring me to life&quot; to the sombre &quot;my immortal&quot;  a good by and well worth your money

6304626495|5.0|This movie is often decried for being sacrilegious. Quite the contrary! It should be seen by every Christian, as it so illuminates Christian history. But in a supremely enjoyable and funny manner- making it, along with Princess Bride, the top comedy ever. Unless one feels they can not laugh *along with* God, there is nothing offensive in this movie. Here you get to learn why there are so many splits in the church, as people in the very beginning follow the holy shoe or the holy cloak. Or the fight that breaks out in the first scene of the movie (the only one depicting Jesus) over whether, when Jesus said \\"Blessed are the peacemakers,\\" he meant cheese-makers or everyone in the dairy industry. How can one not see here a reflection of Christian misinterpretation and subsequent divisions through the ages? In truth, I know of no other work that in such a light-hearted manner shows me truly who I am.<br />Monty Python is always great acting, and even better writing; The consummation of British wit. They take reality around them, and twist it, to show us the reality that lies beneath. Some brief unfortunate gratuitous nudity is easily endured. Watching this movie provides innumerable quotes for future use. (\\"Splitters!\\" \\"What have the Romans ever done for us?\\") And the final song, which I can't describe for risk of spoiler, and also following reviewer guidelines, is worth the price of the entire video.
B000002B7M|5.0|While not Ozzy's greatest album, it is still one of the greatest the metal genre has ever seen.  \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" contains the inhuman virtuosity of Randy Rhoads, my personal favorite guitarist of all time.  The playing was so godly that it was only matched (at the time) by Eddie Van Halen (check out that debut also).  His playing is the best aspect of this record, but doesn't overshadow Osbourne's enormous vocal talent at all.  In fact, it only amplifies it.<BR>1)  I Don't Know - A classic Ozzy track.  Amazing guitar work throughout, especially in the interlude where the song slows down and gives Ozzy's voice a chance to show its melodic side.<BR>2)  Crazy Train - Well what can I say?  Ozzy's most popular song by far and a great metal guitar song.  I'm not usually a big fan of big mainstream songs that everyone knows, but this song is flawless in every aspect.<BR>3)  Goodbye to Romance - Awesome tune where the pace slows down and gives the album a catchy, melodic song that can still kick rear.  The best factor of it is the guitar solo's, which absolutely scorch.<BR>4)  Dee - Beautiful instrumental that shows Rhoad's virtuosity and also shows metalheads that classical guitar is compatible with shred in the hands of a master.  If you truly apprieciate real metal, you'll like this track.  Otherwise, go back to listening to your sweet little nu-metal junk.<BR>5)  Suicide Solution - From what I understand, this song created quite a lot of controversy back in the day, but I can't see why.  Seems to me like it is actually against suicide.  Anyways, it is a good rocking tune that I enjoy.<BR>6)  Mr. Crowley - Wonderful.  Begins with a forboding organ melody that then transitions into a very heavy song that contains some of Rhoads' greatest recorded solos.  A highlight of the album.<BR>7)  No Bone Movies - The only song of them all that I consider to be mediocre.  Basic run of the mill rocker that doesn't contain anything special.  Only track I would consider skipping over.<br />8)  Revelation (Mother Earth) - Epic, atmospheric, depressing.  My personal favorite of 'em all.  Starts out with a - oh, just listen to it already!<BR>9)  Steal Away the Night - Great rocker.  Fast paced, catchy chorus and great musicmanship all around.  Pefect recipy for a rock song.  Great way to close a great album.
B00006SFBD|5.0|As the teenaged boy in American Beauty told us, we can find beauty in the stragest places, whether it is a paper bag caught in a swirl of wind, blood dripping down the head of a dead man or in this case, An incredibally aggressive Death Metal Album.<br />Opeths juxtaposition of grinding growly Death Metal and floaty prog-ish accoustic rock has been spoken of in glowing terms by metal fans all over the world. After Opeth becoming my freind's favorite band after only a few listens, this is one band I had to check out, despite any reservations I previously had about growling Death Metal.<br />As some of you may not know, Opeth originally planned this volume to be a 2 disc set, something they had never done before. The two discs, Deliverance and Damnation were to juxtapose as one heavy album (Deliverance) and one mellow (Damnation). Even the titles show Opeth's fervent love for the literary device known as oxymoron. <br />As we know the albums have been split in two, and Damnation is coming next month or so. After hearing this disc I can honestly say I cannot wait. Opeth is something you might not like the very first time you hear it. But the incredibally odd assortment of notes that somehow makes sense seeps into your brain and even the most die-hard advocate of clean vocals will find themselves growling along with the vocals in no time.<br />The album opens with a rush of drums and guitar, a quick growl by Akerfeldt just to let us know this is going to be one heavy Disc. the song doesn't let up at all, and is only sung cleanly for a few scant lines near the end. Incredibally melodic and layered, \\"Wreath\\" the first song clocks in at just over 11 minutes perfectly seguing into the next song.<br />The title track begins with a driving repititious riff that rears it's head several times during the songs 14 minute legnth. This song is masterpiece, the perfect blending of trippy accoustics and blindingly loud thunderous guitars, plus Akerfeldts at times frightening, at times soulful singing make this one simply breathtaking.<br />The next song \\"A Fair Judgement\\" shows that they aren't going to completely abandon their more mellow side on this album, as they brood and sulk, depressing anyone who cares to let this song seep in. How very heart felt and beautiful this album is already!<br />Before the last two songs you will get an interlude called \\"For Absent Freinds\\" that is soothing and clear, a beautifully played instrumental.<br />With these last two selections, Opeth has delievered the calm before the storm, as they quickly launch into \\"Master's Apprentices\\" a nearly 11 minute serving of Death Metal as it should be. Driving, powerful, unyelding but with enough progressive influence and incredibally smart playing and dynamics to make it easily the best song on the album.<br />The final song on this wonderful album is \\"By The Pain I See in Others\\" A song that actually showcases Akerfeldt growling in a unusually ghostly manner over a soft accoustic set. The song rises in a great Death Metal Crescendo and ending with a 4 minute plus Decresendo, a song that seems to just waver in and out of existance as the album finally puts itself to sleep<br />I simply cannot wait for the next one.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Hybrid Theory was more of an experimental CD. It explored in all techniques. In hip-hop, rock, classical, pop, and punk. Meteora is an expansion on these experiments. Meteora takes the song every1 has probably heard 1000 times and makes it better. Much better. Somewhere I Belong is the new In The End. But Somewhere I Belong is a much better song. The beginning is an acoustic guitar that was played backwards then put in sequence. The whole CD may be described as a remake of Hybrid Theory. Well, Linkin Park already made a remake of Hybrid Theory: Reanimation! And it was really good. The good thing about Meteora is it an anything CD. You can listen to it while reading, studying, doing homework, or chillin. You can sing along, or let it become backround music. This CD is for the Linkin Park fans, not for the critics!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin Park done what no other rock band ever done...that is make tight melodies and sounds....other rock bands are tight but not one of them can make cool sounds everytime in their albums...seriously...no other rock band....LP all the way!!
B00004XOWM|1.0|Now i admit i used to like this sh!tpile of a band, but that was until this album came out, i have matured since then.Lets face it, this album is a big pile of sellout sh!t, the drumbeats are simple, so is the bass, the guitar is okay (wes never reaches his full potential with limp bizkit) and what is up with dursts voice. i remember reading a review by someone calling himself &quot;fred dursts # 1 fan&quot; or something like that for this album saying that fred durst is the best vocalist around, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF JONATHAN DAVIS, COREY TAYLOR, MAX CAVALLERA, TOM ARAYA OR ANGELA GOSSOW (a woman). Those vocalists are way better than fred durst (he sounds as if he's crying all the time). And if you say they're not sell outs than why did thier guitarist leave (he said himself that he felt they were dong it for the money and not the music). Take it from me, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. check out bands like KoRn, slipknot, soulfly, sepultura, in flames, arch enemy, mudvayne, stone sour or slayer.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Hybrid Theory is the best rock album I've ever heard in my whole life....now Meteora has top that cd and I'm enjoying this cd....HELL YEA....
0345357116|5.0|The Unfinished tales by J.R.R. Tolkien reinforces the sense that one is not reading a fantasy at all, but a history that goes back a very long way. Here one can read the history of Galadriel and Celeborn, and of the mysterious Istari.  True Tolkien fans will love this! After a journey through these pages, both the movies and the written trilogy seem to have sprung from an ancient and nearly forgotten manuscript. Most enjoyable reading.
B00008H2LE|5.0|LoL...they aren't music god but they can be...lol...anyway Meteora rules man...great beats, melodies, and yea...hard rock music....a must buy for everyone who like the whole rock rap thing...
B00007E8O5|5.0|In this day of mediocre, mass produced corporate rock, this album is a much needed retreat.  I can't remember the last double album I purchased, let alone one that is as fine as this from beginning to end.  The songs play like a story, an emotional outpour from an extremely talented artist that has gone largely unnoticed since his days with Alice.  It's a shame indeed that this album receives little to no airplay.  But that's understandable, it is far too intricate and independent to fit in with the bland radio playlists that suffocate our airwaves.  Thank you Jerry, for presenting your fans with this tremendously crafted exposition.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This cd is so addictive...I can't stop listening to it...Linkin Park is a hit and will always be my favorite rock band.
B000002H2H|4.0|Ride The Lightning is the first of Metallica's three great albums. It's more musically complex, melodic, and deeper lyrically than their debut Kill 'Em All (yet still hard as nails). I would assume that by now, most Metallica fans own this already. If you don't, you need to.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Been listening to the cd for hours, like 3 so I've been listening to it like 5 times like 5 stars...hehe...so tired now...but can't stop listening...ITS SO TIGHT...
0440224764|5.0|This was an absoulutely fantastic book!  I do not want to give away the story and ruin the whole book for you.  I will say this:<br />The pace was very fast, hardly any legal yawns.  This was an extremely well written plot with action that flowed.  I admired the integrity, intelligence, and strong will in Patrick.  I agree that the ending was not what we would have expected, but what in life ever is?  I am not a legal beagal or a re-reader.  I am making an exception for this one!
B00008H2LB|5.0|So tight....hard work from a great band = great sound and great music
B00005JLSC|1.0|I went to this movie today expecting to really like it, but I was let down.  The best parts are the songs.  The story line isn't good, it just gets the viewer from one song to another.  The music video for \\"And All That Jazz\\" is better than the movie.  I suggest that anyone interested in this movie buy the soundtrack instead of this movie on VHS or DVD.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I was wondering what to expect when John Logan wrote and Stuart Baird took over directing for the Star Trek franchise, but I was not disappointed.  Baird brought a new visual style to this movie (ex. extensive panel closeups, lots of camera motion during the battle sequences) that made it like you were in the movie and not just a spectator.  This movie had the best battle sequence since the Wrath of Khan.  I wasn't disappointed.
B000021XS0|5.0|If you are expecting some heavy guitars riffs and eerie vocals, you will get them, but a lot of the CD is softer stuff. Through her Eyes isn't bad, it's just really soft and it sounds kinda like elton john or something. If you want good' ol prog metal, buy images and words. I like images better, but this is definitely a top notch masterpiece.
B000022TSY|2.0|Something of a dubious milestone. When it first came out it was hailed as a classic and groundbreaking cinema and it was just as much required viewing as \\"2001\\". Over the years it has come to be considered as the spearhead of \\"form without content\\" cinema. Having seen it again since it's initial release, it is something of an embarassment and little more than a misguided curio and observation of a social movement as seen from a comfortable disengagued distance (no matter what people say about Corman, he was still in the business of selling tickets and this was just as much exploitation as \\"Riot On Sunset Strip\\" was a year or two earlier). Not just for the false notes it hits and stereotypes it depicts, it revels in its own smugness and conceit making, at least for this ageing hippy, a very uncomfortable experience. Sadly, this movie will be judged by many as \\"the way it was\\" and it will become something of a reference point for viewers and film makers who were not alive during this period to point to as a touchstone of accuracy. The hippie movement becomes pigeon-holed much the same way people viewed surfing in the 60's from the standpoint of \\"Beach Blanket Bingo\\". To use a well worn cliche` \\"it ain't necessarily so\\".
B000003TA4|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever. Buy this if you like nirvana, or if you like grunge. I admit, some tracks on here may be boring, but the overall package is excellent.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park is a great band with many strong points, but as always has its flaws. This CD was a great CD to keep up their reputation as an incredible rock band, yet it is not something that will completly blow away fans. <BR>Pro's: The music is great. Somewhere I Belong has a strong message, Chester has some quality singing in this song. Session, even though without lyrics, has some impressive moments that will keep you at the edge of your seats.<BR>Cons: 37 minutes is definetly not enough for such an album. They should have pushed the limits and either added more songs or increased the length of the other songs. Also some of the songs get old after listening to them constantly. <br />Overall as said before, its a great album that impresses a fan, but does not blow them away. A good fallow up to hybrid theory, but could have been even better.
B000003TAW|4.0|This Cd is definitely a good buy, but the first track is extremely boring, as well as the last track. If you like weezer, this is a must buy.
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is just beyond what you could imagine incorporated into a heavy metal cd. System of a Down not only has incredible points in their songs that show the many things wrong in the system we live by (hence their name) but the music is outstanding to back it up. Every song has its own special point and its own special moment in which it captures you.<BR>1 Prison Song: A great song in which SOAD sings about the many people stuck in prisons. Captures you right from teh beggining with the first few notes. Great points in which random facts are intelligently managed into the song about prisons. And some repeating lines that you wait for throughout the song. 4.5/5<BR>2 Needles: With a similar sounding beggining as prison song. Another great fast paced song, slows down toward the end carefully and makes the song even better. Singing \\"im just sitting in my room with a needle in my hand waiting for the tomb of some old dying man\\" 5/5<BR>3 Deer Dance: Has its own little twist to it. In the beggining the work with the guitar and drums is incredible, you have to hear it. Also the twist done with the voice in the beggining. If you would graph this song on a pace level it would be a straight line with just huge jumps in spots.  5/5<BR>4 Jet Pilot: Not my favorite but still a great song to show off some incredible talets with instruments. One of the songs that will have you moving your head to the beat. The chorus is much \\"louder\\" than the rest of the song 4/5<BR>5 X: A beggining with a twist to it. Very quick and another song that has a strong point to it. You have to hear it to be impressed 4.5/5<BR>6 Chop Suey!: Oh god I cant begin to say what an amazing song. One of the best on the cd. It just has this strange way into capturing you and you will loose yourself listening to the music and the lyrics. 5/5<BR>7 Bounce: An intresting song, the lyrics are based sort of a story that has an intresting sound to it \\"I went out on a date with a girl a bit late she had so many friends,i brought my pogo stick just to show her a trick, she had so many friends\\" 5/5<BR>8 Forest: This is my favorite on the album. It has a wide variety of everything. I find myself singing to this one without knowing it 5/5<BR>9 ATWA: A slow start and gives you a break from the adrenaline rush. But quickly takes you back to that intense world. I think this song has the best beggining out of all of the songs. It goes from slow to fast a lot making it a song that just keeps grabbing you and letting go. 5/5<BR>10 Science: A song with much meaning to it just like the rest of this one but this meaning is somehow easier to pick up, just look at the title. Some good intrumental points in it. 4.5/5<BR>11 Shimmy: The shortest song in the cd but you wont miss school again boys and girls after listening to this. A great rythym to the lyrics 4/5<BR>12 Toxicity: A strong song thats basically nothing to say bad about it. Again lyrics with an extremly good point to how we live in this world. An excellent beggining to the song, just listen. 5/5<BR>13 Phsyco: The fastest song on the cd if you ask me. Within seconds your ears go wild. Its an incredible rush. 4/5<BR>14 Aerials: Another favorite, incredible everything. Good guitar work in the beggining. Incredible singing. 5/5<br />So overall I just wanna say, click the buy button now!!!
B00005JL2O|5.0|Once again, Mike Myers is back as Austin Powers... and Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and a new character Goldmember.  All the favorite cast members are back including No. 2, Frau, Scotty Evil, and of course, Mini-Me.  Felicity Shagwell is no longer the spy/agent partner.  Beyonce Knowles fills this role in an excellent big screen debut.  Dr. Evil once again has an evil plot to take over the world, with his Dutch partner Goldmember, who owns a night club in 1975.  He kidnaps Austin's father (Michael Caine) and takes him back in time.  In order to find him, Powers uses Evil's help, while he plans to blow a meteor up and let the world flood.  Mini-Me, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, and Fat Bastard are HILARIOUS!  This movie is definately one of the funniest you will see.
0802136834|5.0|Magnificent account of Henry and his wives.I was fascinated by the way the authors tell the story: compelling, exciting and right to the point.The authors do a fantastic job with each wife of Henry.You can almost know them as if you were talking to them.The authors make the wives come alive with good insight. The authors also do a fantastic job in explaining the different political forces working in Europe at that time and the effect the had on Henry and his wives.Overall, this is a must for anyone who wants to study English History...Just magnificent!!
067942850X|4.0|Chris McCandless was the lead editor for the Emory Wheel and graduated a few years after me. I would occasionally go back on campus and pickup the Emory Wheel and read away. What struck me about Chris' articles was his stark alienation on any position. I had a gnawing feeling that this person was severely unbalanced. He wrote with a sort of libertarian anger fused with his personal diatribes (he hated most all of Reagan policies...i.e star wars- and at the same time all the polar opposites.) It was gut wrenching to read and to this day I do not understand why someone could not have seen it. Sad story but a well written book.
0812550706|5.0|I totally loved this book from start to finish.  Anyone who is a fan of the Playstation/Nintendo genre will love it too.  Future Earth is at war with a race of aliens.  The only hope in defeating the aliens lies in have \\"computer game simulation\\" like skills.  Children are trained in a military academy using all kinds of virtual war games.  The training is inspired by the skills of a great leader who was able to rout the aliens in one of the few decisive battles that the Earth had ever won against the alien.<br />Endor, an outcast in society is thrust into the training academy where he proceeds to become possibly one of the greatest virtual game generals to ever train.<br />The book also brings into play the idea of \\"forced\\" population control.  In order to have a child, you must be approved by the government.  Though apparently not a big issue with regard to the rest of the book it is interesting anyway.
B000002AGY|5.0|How did I miss this one? I was really into jazz albums issued on the CTI label back in the 1970s, but I was completely unaware of this until I heard it on vinyl recently at a friend's house. Naturally, I had to have my own copy, so I ordered it on CD as soon as I returned home.<BR>I like the whole CD, but the core of this is the magnificent interpretation of Concierto de Aranjuez which in my opinion makes Miles Davis' critically acclaimed Sketches of Spain pale by comparison. <BR>On Concierto, Hall is accompanied by jazz legends Paul Desmond, Ron Carter and Chet Baker as well as accomplished session men Steve Gadd and Roland Hanna. This sextet blends so smoothly, you might think these guys had been together for years. That can be partially credited of course to the production of Creed Taylor and the arrangements of the label's arranger Don Sebesky, but also to Taylor's instinctive ability to gather musicians who meshed with one another for whatever project was at hand.<BR>This jazz masterpiece is one that belongs in every audiophile's collection. Order it today!
B00005JKZ3|2.0|A lomg-awaited sequel.  Never had I heard some much bad word-of-mouth about a movie even before it premiered.  I was very disappointed in Men In Black II.  I somewhat enjoyed the first film.  Will Smith just seems to be playing the same smart-aleck character in every film he does.  In this one, he is cutting people off in mid-sentence wanting them to shut up.  Being rude and insulting to white people in this film was really a turn off.  Bad writing.  I did not feel there was enough screen time for Mr. Tommy Lee Jones.  Is there even a plot in this film?  Interesting was the cameo appearance of singer/actor/entertainer Michael Jackson.  Perhaps Michael Jackson would  have been better than Will Smith. (Michael Jackson was good in THE WIZ [1978]). The outtakes were of just Will Smith taking up valuable time just to be silly and get attention.  The Blooper reel shows just how unprofessional  Will Smith can be whereas Tommy Lee Jones can prove how much of a consummate actor he is.  Tommy Lee Jones can be serious and jump right back into character when the director needs it.  The sequel just might have killed the entire Men In Black franchise once and for all.  Will Smith and Special Effects  doesn't always work for a film.  They say in Hollywood, that if a film needs unnecessary, unrelated cameo appearances and then a shot of the Statue of Liberty, it's probably a bad film in trouble. Men In Black means \\"black suit\\" not \\"ethnic\\".  I would like to see Tommy Lee Jones do a Men In Black without Will Smith.  I like the alternate ending when Will Smith was put in the egg pod.  They should have cut right there and left it like that.    Watch Tommy Lee Jones in [[ASIN:0767821610 Eyes of Laura Mars]](1978).  Men in Black III will be released May 25, 2012.
B00008H2LB|4.0|This CD is fantastic. I probably would give it more like 4 and a half stars. It is definately short but the last album they came out with was less than a year ago, so give them a break. Good music if you like their style.  Their sound definately hasn't changed or progressed much.  The real progression is in the lyrics.  Overall a good album and good to listen to.  Faint is the best track in my eyes.  It is fast and exciting. Definately the best tune. See if you cant hear that track or at least Somewhere I Belong before you buy the CD.  If you don't like those a lot it wont be worth your money.  Buy this CD if you are want the same Linkin Park sound, with better lyrics.  This CD stands up, speaks up, and shuts up.
B00006V9A0|5.0|the whole cd is great especially with smells like teen spirit that makes you just want to jump up and all apologies that i kind of felt was a message of his suicide the only song i didnt like was silver but then i read his biography heviar then heaven but now i understand it but still the whole cd is just great go buy it now
B000069CWE|5.0|This CD is the BOMB! I've listened to 50 cent, Eminem, but this tops it. Right now my favorite song is Place for My Head with Zion featuring in it. I've listened to Hybird, Metorea, but Reanimation is the best. I've loved Linkin Park ever since there first hit song: In the End. I'm a loyal fan, and if you think that there is a better Album, the you have bad taste. With all due respect of course...
B000071ZZI|4.0|Amazing that a Sory line that Started in 1975, could become such a good movie 28 years later. Especially when the Lead Character Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) was only 5 years old, when Robert Ludlem first saw his book hitting the shelves.<BR>Even I can remember the book sitting on my Gradparents Coffee Table when I was a child. Especially when My Grandfathers Lastname is infact..&quot;BOURNE&quot;......how Ironic.<BR>I rate this movie a strong Thumbs Up.......and would love to see the Other two books become sequals to the First.!!
B00008VPUP|5.0|yeah...see it...if you haven't, you're weird.
B00005JKCH|4.0|From the guy who brought you \\"The Evil Dead\\" comes this high-flying adaption of the legendary comic series.  The cast is great, the cinematography is fun, the music is adventurous, the writing is excellent, the directing perfect - it's just an awesome movie.  Who would've expected that a comic book adaption would turn out to be a great movie to send your spider-senses tingling?
B00001QEE9|1.0|I WANT THOSE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK!! this is so NOT a Disney classic, even though everyone seems to think so! DO NOT SEE IT!! YOU WILL DIE!!
0451167716|5.0|Out of 100 people 90 have heard of Mario Puzo's &quot;The Godfather&quot;.  If you haven't, then you are missing the best book I have ever read that grabs a top 10 spot (number 1?) among the greatest novels of all-time.  Later a brilliant film, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is the tale of a mob boss' son who, until now, was innocent but is forced to join the family business after his father is critically wounded in a hit from an enemy gang.  Brilliant; Puzo has created a masterpiece of modern fiction.  A must-read.  I also highly recommend the film.
B00006SFLV|5.0|.. This amazingly crafted show was brilliant. I don't know a single person who wasn't completely in love with it. (Makes you wonder why they canceled it after only one season.  I still don't understand it)<br /> We all could see ourselves as Angela, Brian, Rayann, Ricky, or Jordan. It covered every emotion and problem that a teenager could face. And, the beautiful thing about this show was that it wasn't limited to &quot;teeny-boppers&quot;....20's and 30 something's loved it too... Now, I don't have to keep watching my dubbed copies from MTV reruns,... and can have them all, to keep forever. This is a fabulous collection for anyone. The only thing I want to caution against is that there are no extras on this DVD... just the shows.  But - really --- do you need anything else?
6305095566|5.0|This is actually one of the only movies to never scare me and keep me awake at night. It is just awsome, gorey, bloody, good plot. Just great!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is one of the few CD's that I have bought lately that you can push play and listen to it all the way through. <br />The only problem with the CD is the length, only 37 minutes. So they stick to what they know as Hybrid Theory is about the same length. <br />All in all if you liked Hybrid Theory, then you will want to go buy this CD. If you heard Somewhere I belong on the radio and thought it was cool, then you too will also want to buy this CD.
B00005A1VG|5.0|I Love this movie! Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland were one of the great Hollywood Screen Couples.  Some of the many movies they did together were watchable only because of their Great chemistry. Others were classic.  This is the Best of all their on screen pairings.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Usually when movies have a lot of hype, I am disappointed when I see them (not always, I loved Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) and was expecting something not to my liking (Moulin Rouge).  This reviewer was surprised to find the film to be unbelievably extraordinary!   In fact, my only complaint is that the talented Renee Zelwiger in the lead role of Roxie Hart didn't win the OSCAR--and that Gere should have at least been nominated ...<BR>The talent of everyone in this musical was amazing.  Catherine Zeta Jones, who has the most astonishing beauty, perfectly portrayed Velma Kelly.  She can sing, act, dance, and in her thirties, still do the splits.  I was also very impressed with the performances of the other actors.  It has been a long time since I have been to a movie where I had a smile on my face during the entire show.  It was only with great restraint that I didn't embarrass myself by applauding after every dance number.  <BR>Speaking of the dance numbers, I have one word, WOW!  In fact, my favorite number was the 'puppet' song and dance!  Never in my life have I ever seen anything so awesome!  The theater was full and not one person got up to leave until after the last credit rolled.  Evidently everyone felt the same as me!  I could have sat through the entire movie again.  The people who were with me felt the same.  I recommend that even though hundreds of thousands of DVD's will be sold, see CHICAGO in the theater to experience the full effect of this year's best picture!
B0000039PW|4.0|It starts off slowly but gets better,the songs are cool.It is a really good album i liked most of it.But.....the interludes are a bit boring and basically ruin some songs.I really liked juicey,the song has an amazing beat.Machine gun funk has this really good tune to it,and so does everyday struggle.I say that this is album could of been better,life after death is probably his best album.But this has alot of things that l.a.d doesnt.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I bought this when I realized I loved seven songs on it--and then after a week of listening I liked (pretty much) all of them. I float back to 1975...even though I was born in 1984! Fleetwood Mac have always been a wonderful mix of folk, rock and...something else. There's a song for everyone on this album, and I can't recommend this little piece of rock history enough.<BR>Favorite picks: &quot;Landslide&quot; (Of course) &quot;Songbird,&quot; &quot;Go your own way&quot; &quot;Little Lies&quot; &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; and the Lyndsy Buckingham live version of &quot;Go Insane&quot;
B000000OEI|4.0|Here lies another great score by Hans Zimmer in the likes of The Rock and The Peacemaker. Here, the music runs at one hour, split into only 5 tracks. The music overall is powerful and testosterone filled with a large orchestra and an all male choir. The main theme is one of Zimmer's best that perfectly represents the trials and tribulations of battle in a submarine. &quot;Mutiny&quot; starts out with the chorus humming along with a synths and a gently played guitar that then leads into the main theme introduced lightly and then once again in full force. &quot;Alabama&quot; is the longest track I have ever come across on a film score album, clocking in at almost 24 minutes! &quot;Little Ducks&quot; features the choir singing the traditional Navy hymn, &quot;Eternal Father Strong to Save&quot;, which is perfectly appropriate for a film like this and sounds wonderful as well. &quot;1SQ&quot; is a more hard hitting action cue than the others, as &quot;Roll Tide&quot; comprises the main theme and the Navy hymn together. All of the tracks basically sound the same, which is why I didn't go into specific detail on each one. That would take forever, especially on &quot;Alabama&quot;. But all in all, a great score that I think you will enjoy, especially if you are a Zimmer fan.
0385474547|5.0|Even a casual read through this classic demonstrates what it takes to construct a literary masterpiece: humanity, humor, relevance and universality.  The great works are universal because they are so rooted in their time and place and in so being they demonstrate the essential humanity of their characters. Greek tragedies, Shakespeare's plays, the 19th century Russian novelists all appealed to their contemporaries and history as a consequence of such traits. This novel falls into this category and is simply a MUST read for any serious reader. Every couple years when I return to it, I find the depth of wit and wisdom with which Achebe presents the conflict of generations and cultures, an essential sameness those cultures miss in judging by superficial traits, and in that I am assured of the skill that modern literature still demonstrates.
0790738074|5.0|I've always thought that musicals were sort of good, but my opinion changed when i saw The Music Man! The actors were amazing, the songs were lively and danceable, and the storyline actually made sense! <br />The Music Man is a story about a salesman Harold Hill [played by Robert Preston in a role that will forever be his, no matter how many remakes hollywood tries to throw at us] who goes to a small town in iowa to try to sell the townspeople band instruments/uniforms by telling people he will start a boy's band. the catch: he can't tell two notes apart. in comes Marian Paroo [the lovely and talented Shirley Jones], the town's librarian and music teacher. Hill tries to charm Paroo into silence about his lack of musical ability but she seems invincible. will she expose him as a phony, or will he manage to win her over?<BR>This movie is filled with unforgettable songs such as Seventy-Six Trombones or Marian the Librarian, amazing characters like Harold Hill or Winthrop the lisper, and danceable tunes. the music will make you jump up and start singing and dancing to it, and the beautiful costumes will make you wish that you lived in that time. The Music Man is truly the best of the best! :)
B00006RCNW|5.0|Wow! At first I was skeptical but the Shield has really proven itself to me as the most entertaining cop show/tv drama to date. Chiklis is amazing as a villainous genious guiding us through a serpentine life as a corrupt policeman and loving father.  This show really pulls it off. I noticed there are a number of new actors who are shining as well as some from great experienced character actors giving incredible performances.  <BR>You cannot help but to notice that many of the issues of politics, racism, corruption, and sexuality are dealt with no holds barred and can be traced directly to reality. <br />Just a great show. You gotta see it. Just as good if not better than Sopranos.  Faster moving and more shocking in some cases.
B000021YQV|5.0|this is the best album by system of a down, definetly. i love them, and i love thier videos. this album has the singles such as chop suey, toxicity, and all the others i like, such as deer dance, science, aerials, prison song, atwa, and more.
0316666343|5.0|This is one book I would recommend to anyone. I think it brings comfort to those who have lost someone. The book was written beautifully. It was easy to imagine being in heaven and knowing your loved ones were not in a horrid place. The stuggles the Salmon family dealth with after Susie's death were realistic. I could not put the book down after the first couple of sentences. I haven't read a book this good in a long time.
B000089RVX|5.0|The new and innovating voice of Amy Lee just astonishes my ears as the ballads bring my soul to peace, and the full out rock songs explode with intensity.  The blend of her voice and the accompaniment just mixes together well.  This is an outstanding new band, and I would hope to see new albums come our way.
B000089RVX|5.0|After hearing &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; repeatedly on the radio at work for the last several weeks and still not being tired of it... I decided it might be worth it to check this out. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase. The truth is if you can't appreciate the music on this album... you have no clue what real music is. Good modern rock sound that isn't too hard for old people (you know... 30+), and yet it's not so soft that only women and small children would appreciate it. The lead singer has an incredible voice... and it has nothing to do with how she looks in a skimpy outfit either. It's always great when a rock band realizes there are more instruments out there than a guitar, bass, and drums. The additional vocals on several tracks are also great and really enhance the whole experience. I get tired of people doing reviews and using dumb words that they think sound cool or intelligent like &quot;haunting&quot; and &quot;lilting&quot;... so I'll just say this album is one of the best I've heard in the last few years and well worth the price of admission.
B0000039LE|5.0|Today, you can't find a descent horror movie. All of them are just some cheap teen horror flicks.<br />If you want a movie that will give you nightmares for a while, get Halloween. I am 19 and I couldn't fall asleep, thinking that Michael Myers might come into my house.<br />I don't know nayone who cannot get scared by this movie. If you like good horror movies, this is the one for you.
B00005JLK1|2.0|Any horror movie made during the mid 90s or later is almost always TRASH (exceptions include The 6th Sense, The Others).  In these post-modern times, horror movies aren't scary and the characters are more disgusting than the ghosts/monsters.  And the music...the heavy metal/alternative noise in Ghost Ship is simply awful.  If you want to know how proper horror music sets an atmosphere and a mood, check out any 80s John Carpenter flick or an early 90s Full Moon movie (i.e., Puppet Master, Pit and the Pendulum). I'd recommend the good 80s movie Ghost Story or even the laughable 80s movie Death Ship (OOP, but available at half.com)...over this one.
0316666343|5.0|I guess I fall into the camp of people who really love this novel.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found it highly original and thoroughly gripping.  I especially thought the technique of &quot;looking down from heaven&quot; was interesting and unique.  The quality of writing is super high and I felt the story moved with good pace.  Overall, a very interesting and involving read that I won't soon forget.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.
B00008977N|5.0|Peter Gabriel does not disappoint on &quot;Secret World Live.&quot; The performances of Peter and the band are excellent. There are a lot of complaints I have read about the video quality, but I find these to be exaggerated. I own a great deal of concert DVDs and this is one of my favorites. It's well worth the small price.
B00006LLNU|5.0|At one point during the first time I listened to this CD (I think it was track six) I felt like jumping out my bedroom windw, or something drastic like that. I listened to it in it's entirety (about 71 minutes). I reget the fact that Sigur Ros was in the Philly area, and I didn't get to see them. I heard their concerts are mindblowing. The CD definitely was. This was my first Sigur Ros CD. I first read about them in a magazine. They aren't for the closed-minded type.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I've always enjoyed Beck, often less as a diehard listener and more with a distant appreciation of his talents.  This album sucked me in beyond belief.  I've listened to it eight times tonight alone!  99% of all solo artists who show up to open mike nights could only wish to have this kind of assuredness and intention in their music.  Awesome!
B00000ILDE|5.0|It's really too bad James Cameron didn't just stick to making movies like this because this is definitely one of the greatest military/sci-fi movies out there. It's got pace, action, intelligence and character, and then of course there're all those damn bugs.  I dunno about anyone else but I had serious nightmares after I first saw it and I was 27 at the time!!<br />Like its wonderful first cousin the James Wong TV series &quot;Space: Above and Beyond&quot;, this movie is first and foremost about people and warfare. The creepy atmosphere, the cool technology and the faceless alien enemies just help to focus things a little more intensely. You get to feel the confidence of the Marines as they begin their assault and then watch with terror as stupidity coupled with surprise and the true lethalness of the enemy cut most of your fancy technology away and you are left with your wits, your courage and whatever gear made it out of the APC in one peice.<br />For my money, the supporting actors in this movie deserve as much praise as Sigourney Weaver (here in the best scripted of Ripley's appearances in the Aliens franchise).  In particular, I must admit to a huge soft spot for the cigar-chomping Sgt. Apone (Al Matthews) and of course the hard-boiled smart-gunner Pvt. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein who won a Saturn award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance here). Paul Reiser (surprise!) also does oily corporate guy Carter Burke really well.<br />The sequence when the marines go into the complex conjures up the grittiness, adrenaline and fear of urban warfare with nothing more than darkness and the sound of water dropping. Sheer genius.<br />I think what I like most about this movie is the way in which the heroism of the humans is really downplayed (with the exception of the stupid &quot;get away from her, ... &quot; line near the end of the film) in favor of professionalism, fear and just wanting to keep you and your mates alive.  Although I have not faced any of these situations as a member of a military unit, this movie gave me a little bit of an inkling as to what it must be like (with the unrealistic bonus of course that the enemy are not people but aliens so you don't have to worry about identifying too closely with them).<br />What &quot;Aliens&quot; also shares with SAAB is a very healthy dose of skepticism about the brass and the suits who seem to be in the driver's seat.  I particularly like way the unholy alliance between the military authorities and Weyland-Yutani was handled. You can pretty much taste Ripley's anger and sheer terror when she realizes that they have sandbagged her into going back to face &quot;it&quot; again, and the feeling returns in spades when the full extent of the company's treachery is revealed.<br />Finally, the other stars of the show are the aliens themselves.  They are a fascinating combination of insect, bondage outfit and carnivorous beast.  They are at once hugely scary and also visually compelling.  One of my fellow Aliens addicts pointed out that they are, in fact (at least in this film) sexy in the way that extreme danger is also sexy. That combined with the horror of the way they reproduce and the ferocity with which they attack, and you have the perfect late 20th century non-human villain.  They are, in a wierd way, the Hannibal Lecters (the Tony Hopkins &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; Hannibal, not the other one) of the alien menagerie.  Nothing else I've seen seems nearly in their league.<br />So in conclusion, this is a keeper: Get the DVD or rent it.  Better still, get your local movie art house to show it on the big screen. But remember to wear your combat boots because you'll be yanking your feet up to avoid the acid burns.hese situations as a member of a military unit, this movie gave me a little bit of an inkling as to what it must be like (with the unrealistic bonus of course that the enemy are not people but aliens so you don't have to worry about identifying too closely with them).  <br />What &quot;Aliens&quot; also shares with SAAB is a very healthy dose of skepticism about the brass and the suits who seem to be in the driver's seat.

B00008H2LE|5.0|If you listen to this for the first time, you will be speechless.  You can't seem to put a finger on it, but this is a new and different Linkin Park.  Maybe it's because they added more electronica or that Chester (The lead singer) sounds a lot more angry for some reason.  Many of their songs are quite a bit heavier and upbeat than the songs on any of their other albums, but they have their soft ones later in the album.  I'm also very happy that Mike (The lead &quot;rapper&quot;) gets to show off his rhymes off a lot on this CD.<br />It seems like there is some sort of aura about this CD that makes it special.  It's a sigh of relief from Linkin Park fans that have waited around a long time for new songs.  <br />Also, this CD is a HUGE breath of fresh air, because LP loses a lot of Hybrid Theory's pop-friendly sound for this CD to be very original and different sounding. (No songs like Crawling or In The End to hurt your brain from listening to it for the 10,000th time!)<br />That is just the way Linkin Park is, they can't be labeled.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I just purchased the cd a couple days ago and I didnt have any regrets because I knew it would blow me away and that is exactly what it did.<BR>From start to Finish it takes you on a journey a definite buy<BR>1-Intro<BR>2-Don't stay 4.5/5-one of the hardest hitting songs on the album.Hahn's scrathing in this song is incredible.It fits perfectly with the heavy hitting guitar riffs.You can tell a difference in Chesters voice from the first two albums. A definite head banger!<br />3-somewhere i belong 5/5-ever since this song came out it has been getting good radio play. and it is very well deserved. You can really tell how Chester and Mike flow in this song.<br />4-Lying from you 5/5-one of my faves on the album.  This song really has a great chorus and awesome samples. Also, Hahn's scratching in this song is extroardinary. GOOD JOB!<br />5-Hit the Floor-4.5/5-Thissong really shows how LP is experimenting with new beats.  Mikes rapping in this song is awesome. ALso Chester in the chorus has a screaming line.  THe best screaming I have heard!<br />6-Easier to Run-4/5-there are a couple of songs on the album that are quite similar.But still a great song when Mike is rapping and Chester is singing together.<br />7-Faint-5/5 this song is also one of my faves. WOW it has a jungle beat and a violin in the backround.how awesome is that in a metal song. It really showshow LP is trying to progress in the genre.<br />8-Figure.09-4.5/5-one of the heaviest hitting songs on the album!<BR>If you liked One step closer you will like this one.<br />9-BREAKING THE HABIT 5/5-whoa! one of the best songs on the album<BR>IT is really an epic song and includes violin.  This is really a new type of song for LP-and my oh my it is touching.<br />10-From the inside 5/5-Also a great song- I think this song does what easier to run didnt. It is a lot like crawling and In the end together.Also the chorus i think is one of the best on the album!<br />11-Nobody's Listening-4.5/5-this song also showshow LP is trying to progress the genre.  It has a Japanese flute in the backround throughout the song. ANd the chorus is awesome with Chester singing and the guitar finally coming in. ALso the most rapping on a song for this album.<br />12-session 5/5-the best instrumental for LP-best with earphones<BR>because you can hear all the layers of sample.<br />13-Numb 5/5- the best song on the album-this song -10 times better than crawling.  chester sings throughout almost the whole song and has a sense of seperation and independence-really inspired me!<br />GOOD JOB LP__BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00005JLZ9|5.0|I loved this movie, it is a must see twice to appreciate it type movie (mainly because of the surprise ending), but worth seeing again!  The plot is convoluted, but  keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the final scene. John Travolta is funny, charming, and charismatic, and I will probably go see this movie at least two more times to be able to totally appreciate the plot.  No, you will never be able to figure out who's the bad guy, who's the good guy, and what really happened (or didn't) but it isn't a mystery, so who cares! I like to see movies that are \\"entertaining\\", I'm not looking for some deep story, etc, and entertaining it is!

B0000033P2|5.0|Trilogy sometimes pales between the two orginal albums that bookend this 1972 release: Tarkus (1971) and Brain Salad Surgery (1973). If you've listened to ELP works in a chronological way, you might think a different band recorded \\"Trilogy,\\" which features for it's longest piece, not an atonal rave-up like Tarkus nor an Apocalyptic requium Mass like \\"Karn Evil 9,\\" but a quiet Bolero.<br />The album features three outstanding cuts: \\"Endless Enigma,\\" \\"Rodeo,\\" and \\"Trilogy.\\" The remaining tracks vary in quality, with the FM ballad \\"From the Beginning,\\" the charming throwaway \\"The Sheriff,\\" the filler track \\"Living Sin,\\" and the complex progressive rock piece \\"Abbandon's Bolero.\\"<br />\\"Endless Engima, broken into three parts, features what I consider Keith Emerson's finest piano composition, his \\"Fugue.\\" The song's other features include a tension-filled intro, and an over-the-top climax with synthized bells ringing. Greg Lake sings about feeling disaffected somehow in a Beatlesque manner a la \\"Penny Lane:\\" the nurse selling Poppies in a roundabout who feels she's in a play.  If you learn to ignore the lyrics, the melody, arrangements, and playing meld into a superb whole. I am always moved when Greg Lakes starts an ascending bass line towards the end of the \\"Fugue\\" section.<br />Keith Emerson not only admired Aaron Copland, he emulated him in his tonalities and arrangements somewhat. \\"Rodeo\\" torques its way through the original, upping the energy from the original, and matching the muscularity of the piece with Emerson's Hammond playing and Palmer's cogent drumming. The piece follows Copland's score pretty closely, too.<br />Trilogy is a romp through Greg Lake's story of disaffected love that starts like a torch ballad and concludes like the soundtrack to a Science Fiction disaster film. Back in 1972 I loved it because I loved the big Moog bass line, a rarity then. Emerson starts off with a piano-bassed acoustic sound, then builds into a nearly totally snythesized section of total bombosity.<br />ELP would go on into their best work after this album, with a cleaner, harder sound, but Trilogy holds up well.section of total bombosity. <br />ELP would go on into their best work after this album, with a cleaner, harder sound, but Trilogy holds up well.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is an intriguing novel about a girl, named Susie Salmon, who was murdered and now continues her life in what she calls her own heaven.  Susie watches her family, friends, and even her murderer as their life on Earth continues without her.  This book is excellently written, but occasionally the plot seems to go astray.   The whole storyline, I feel, is very creative and  explores different aspects of the after life from the author's point of view.  I heard about the book first on the Today show, the book club on the show was raving about how wonderful the story was.  Anyone who wants to read a book a little out of the ordinary should definitely pick this novel up!
B00008H2LB|5.0|After reading the previous reviews, I'm sure you can't decide who are right: the people who say this is better than \\"Hybrid Theory\\" or the people who say this is worse than \\"Hybrid Theory\\". I have decided, and yes, it is better than \\"Hybrid Theory\\", but only by a little, and it was very hard to decide. But this is not a bad CD. No, actually, before this CD was released, \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was my all time favorite album, and if this CD is better, than that is indeed saying a lot.<br />Linkin Park are my favorite band, and if they keep up their work like this, I'm sure they will be for a long time. Every song they play is filled with emotion, true emotion, which pulls you into the song. The music is wonderful. Whereas the guitar work isn't Hendrix, you can still enjoy it, because it fits with the song perfectly, as do the drums, turntables, etc. The lyrics in songs like \\"Breaking the Habit\\" and \\"Figure.09\\" are truly amazing, and can almost make you cry at parts. This is what a truly good album should be.<br />1. Foreword-No Rating-Just a 13 second introduction.      <BR>2. Don't Stay-5/5-Many people say this is the mirror image of \\"One Step Closer\\", but I don't agree. It features great singing & music, and is very hard like \\"One Step Closer\\", but it's not quite a copy. It's...better... <BR>3. Somewhere I Belong-5/5-A great song, and I can see why it's the first single. They lyrics are amazing, and really pull you into the song, but the bridge is the standout part, showing some of Chester's amazing vocal abilities.<BR>4. Lying From You-5/5-A more rappy song (such as \\"By Myself\\" and \\"With You\\" were off \\"Hybrid Theory\\"), but it improves upon the lyrics of the last albums more rappy songs. Great.<BR>5. Hit The Floor-5/5-Another song with more of a rap reflection in it, but the chorus is the best part, with Chester screaming and Mike rspping together, such as in \\"Forgotten\\". It's about being the victim of someone who walks all over you because they think they're better than you...until they \\"Hit the Floor\\"...<BR>6. Easier To Run-5/5-A \\"Crawling\\"-type song, with long, dragged out choruses (I know I make that sound like a bad thing, but I can't describe it any other way) and good lyrics. It's slower than the rest of the album, which makes it standout.<BR>7. Faint-5/5-Starts out with an interesting beat, then into a hard intro with an awesome guitar riff, and into Mike rapping, and you know the rest. One of the best.<BR>8. Figure.09-5/5-This is possibly the best song on the album. What really stands out is the powerful singing by Chester on the chorus and the lyrics of it. Awesome.<BR>9. Breaking The Habit-5/5-This is another song with amazing lyrics and singig by Chester. The music consists of turntables, strings an a small orchestra, which makes it different from the rest of the album. I'm glad they did it. One of the best.<BR>10. From The Inside-5/5-There's nothing to unique that you haven't heard already from \\"Don't Stay\\" and the likes of it on this song, but that's not a bad thing. It's still great. Awesome screams from Chester.<BR>11. Nobody's Listening-4/5-The only slip on the whole album, but you might think differently if you're more into rap. I'm not at all, which is why I give this a 4, and it would be a 3 if it weren't for the interesting Japanese flute they added in. But the guitar part's easy to learn.<BR>12. Session-No Rating-This is what \\"Cure For The Itch\\" was on the last album: a sampling/turntables interlude, so I don't have much to say about it, except \\"nice beats\\".<BR>13. Numb-5/5-Great lyrics, singing, music, everything. You just have to listen to this. The chorus is awesome. One of the best.<br />Was 2 and a half years worth the wait for this? ...YES. This is truly an essential recording as far as I'm concerned... Yes, I was a little anxious to see if Linkin Park could maintain their rank as #1 to me with this album, and they have done that, and have done that very well.

Songs like &quot;somewhere i belong&quot;, &quot;faint&quot;, &quot;from the inside&quot;, and especially &quot;numb&quot; will leave you stunned. &quot;breaking the habit&quot; would be a hit if it had a stronger chorus. overall, these songs will almost make hybrid theory seem plain. buy this now. -KoRnFan
0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi is the type of book that I wish my friends were reading.  As soon as I finished the book I had a strong desire to discuss it with someone - but this book is esoteric.  I need a fellow reader who appreciates Indian culture, has a twisted fascination with  religion, is enchanted with wild life, and has the ability to READ BETWEEN THE LINES!  There is so much in this book worthy of discussion that it is a complete disservice to tell people \\"It is about a boy who becomes shipwrecked and is stuck on a lifeboat with a tiger.\\"  <br />There were passages in this book (including a desperate prayer) that I wanted to copy down and hang up somewhere!  A page and a half on the physical effects of fear - the same fear and tension Pi feels being trapped with a tiger, some of us experience at work an stuck in traffic.  <br />Pi's honest desire to seek God and do the right thing, then his slipping in complete survival mode and being forced into a position where he must learn to outsmart and manipulate others could be a commentary on modern life, for those who look for such things.<br />In spite of my interest, I'm not sure this book made it into my top ten favorite - but it definately has me thinking.  It is the type of book that keeps me from picking up a new one for a few days after I finish.
0553277472|5.0|I just wanted to say that although this book is a work of great importance and genius on its own, and can be very valuable without any knowledge of zen, an understanding of some zen principles can bring on a whole new level of comprehension of the book (and no, you dont have to be a buddhist for this to help). A good place to start is with the writings of d.t. suzuki. Although his writings are many years old now, the language is timeless, and his simple, reverent style is very readable.  Read his Introduction to Zen, and then read this book again.  Youll be amazed at what you missed the first time around.

0887307280|4.0|I just finished reading this book, and there are definitely very useful and applicable ideas one absorbs from it.  I sometimes was very annoyed however by the &quot;infomercial&quot; style of writing of the author.  It is very clear that Gerber wrote this book to promote his company's business.  <br />The main idea of this book is that all businesses needs to decide on and document how everything is done, so ideally the business would run like a machine, a &quot;money-making machine&quot; as Gerber likes to call it.  Gerber tries to cover all business processes in this book, from Marketing to employee motivation.  I found that all chapters except Ch. 16 (&quot;Your People Strategy&quot;) had excellent and practical ideas. Ch. 16 I thought poorly discussed practical ways of keeping your employees motivated, Gerber basically says make your business look like a game to them but does not give practical examples on how to do that.  Nevertheless, the books is worth the read and you should always remember that it will only be useful to you if you act and implement the ideas discussed.
6305280762|3.0|I remember when I first saw the 1974 disaster epic \\"The Towering Inferno\\" as a child. The movie was playing exclusively at one of those old-fashioned, huge theaters, complete with balcony and curtains which drew open as the film began. The screen was gigantic. There was not an empty seat in the house. Moviegoers applauded as the opening chords of John Williams' tremendous score began thundering from the speakers during the opening credit sequence. And fans continued to applaud, most notably when Steven McQueen finally arrives on the scene, fire marshall red car skidding to a halt, helmet in hand. This film, one of the greatest blockbusters in cinema history, was a true event for 1970s audiences.<br />It has always been easy to dismiss this film, just as most critics dismiss many of the popular disaster films of this era (\\"Airport,\\" \\"Earthquake,\\" \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\"). When watching \\"The Towering Inferno\\" today (this film must be seen in the letterbox format, if only to truly appreciate the fantastic special effects), I feel a sad twinge of nostalgia. Steve McQueen's presence alone is worth the price of admission, and this role would turn out to be one of his last in a major film. He steals just about every scene he's in, simply because of his extraordinary screen presence. A few wrinkles crease his weathered face, he's kind of chubby, but even with middle age slowly approaching, McQueen's spark is undeniable. \\"The Towering Inerno\\" is a great example as to why McQueen was one of our greatest movie stars.<br />Sure, the enormous cast sleepwalks through most of this film in \\"I'm-just-collecting-a-paycheck\\" fashion, but has Paul Newman and Faye Dunaway ever been as attractive as they were in this flick? The Maureen McGovern song \\"We May Never Love Like This Again\\" (which won an Academy Award) is pure 70s schmaltz, the disco fashions relatively amusing (gotta love Richard Chamberlain's suit) and you even have Fred Astaire doing a bit of soft shoe with Jennifer Jones.I'm not going to mention O.J. Simpson's role, simply because he's way too easy of a target these days.<br />Through it all, \\"The Towering Inferno\\" does have an important message, eventually becoming a tribute to the heroism of our nation's firefighters. That's good. I also love one of Newman's final lines in the film, in which he says they should just leave the tower as is - \\"I think they should just leave it, kind of a monument to all the bull[stuff] in the world.\\" It's also interesting to see two legends such as McQueen and Newman working together on screen. In fact, I can't really recall a single film in history in which two acting legends the status of McQueen/Newman starred in the same film together such as this. In today's Hollywood, they really don't make movie stars like this anymore. And they really don't make films like this anymore.<br />Going to the movie theater used to be an event. Huge screens, larger-than-life movie stars, movies playing at the same theater for months at a time. \\"The Towering Inferno\\" reminds me of that era, before cable TV, before video rental stores, before multiplex movie theaters. It's corny, it's funny, and it's special effects-driven. But it's a glamorous film, as old-fashioned as \\"Grand Hotel,\\" and a testament to a bygone era in Hollywood.
B00008LOS1|3.0|I'm sure all the who fanatics already have this, so I don't even know who I'm addressing this to, really.    This is the 4th time Who's Next has been issued on compact disc -the original CD release in the 80s, the \\"Gold Disc\\" version in 1995, the \\"remix and remaster\\" in 1996, and now the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" in 2003.  I'm reallly wondering what's deluxe about it.  First of all, this \\"remaster\\" sounds exactly the same as 1996's \\"remix and remaster\\", which sounded suspiciously the same as 1995's Gold Disc.  In other words, other than being mastered a little louder, no improvement has been made in the sound.    OK, then there's all that unreleased stuff, right?  Wrong.  Only two studio tracks appear that didn't show on the previous release.  Namely, early versions of Won't Get Fooled Again and Gettin' in Tune.  These versions are both little more than rehearsals, and therefore vastly inferior to the official versions.  Interesting but hardly vital additions to the Who legacy    OK, but how about this great live stuff?  Well....    This may be from their prime live period, but this is NOT a prime concert.  Again, this Young Vic show was mostly new material which was still being tentatively performed.  Again, interesting but you and I both know that there's other great live stuff that hasn't been released.    This \\"Deluxe Edition\\" would have been the right time to gather all the material that was part of the Lifehouse project and release on one collection. I see this release as a blown opportunity and, to be honest, more than a bit of a rip-off.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I bought this movie the other day after reading conflicting reviews, and I'm really pleased with my purchase. One word of advice though...<BR>WATCH IT WITH THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE TRACK AND SUBTITLES!<BR>It's 4 or 5 stars with Japanese and about 2 stars in english... Billy Bob Thornton is horrible. This is difinitiely one of the better anime films I've seen and the animation is beautiful...
B000089RW0|3.0|Although this movie wasn't really scary, it did make for a good horror movie.  The special effects were pretty good (the opening scene was OUTSTANDING!!!)and the story line/acting were not as bad as some would make it out to be.  The only complaint I had was that I wish more time would have been taken to explain the whole \\"quota\\" deal.  All in all, I enjoyed the movie and look forward to viewing more films by the individuals who brought this story (and \\"House on Haunted Hill\\" and \\"Thirteen Ghosts\\") to life.
B00008BXJF|5.0|Words are useless.<BR>OK lets try.Old meets new crim with more raw power than COL and a leap forward on production.Better lyrics,drum sound and Fripp solos.<BR>Worth more then five stars!!
B00005TT77|4.0|Most soundtracks are pretty awful, give or take a few. Before I bought this, I was expecting an album full of Beatles songs and a few others thrown in here or there. I think it's neat that they got all of these wonderful artists to contribute to the soundtrack. It shows that the Beatles spirit is still alive, even after 3 decades.<br />Some of the best songs on the album:<br />The Wallflowers' version of &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; is amazing. Dylan has got a great voice and makes a song that wouldn't disappoint Paul, Ringo, or George.<br />The Vines also do another great cover of &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;, which is probably my favorite on the whole album. These Aussie boys are simply great, and they prove so much in this song; they performed it so well.<br />The Stereophonics are one of my favorite bands. Kelly's voice is more amazing than the Wallflowers' Dylan, but a little innapropriate for a Beatles cover. But hey, it's the 'Phonics, and their guitar skills are the best.<br />What would would this album be without a little grunge touch? Pearl Jam's Eddie Veddar stops by on what is one of the most promising tracks on this album, and his voice flows beautifully over the acoustic guitar. Awesome, awesome.<br />Sarah McLachlan does a beautiful job on &quot;Blackbird&quot;. Her voice is so smooth and beautiful and distinct. The guitar on the track is played beautifully too. <br />Beatle fans and non-Beatle fans can appreciate this album from the first track to the seventeenth.<br />-emily.
B000060P79|4.0|pretty good cd.  i was a little weary to buy it because i hate there single &quot;I'll do anything&quot; and they aren't that cute.  lol.  but this is a great cd!  i burned it from my friend.  this is what it is like to be a kid!  a few songs aren't that great, like 'my alien' which is the worst song ever.  also, 'god must hate me','i'll do anything', and the bonus track 'grow up' aren't that great.  but the rest are amazing like 'you don't mean anything', 'when i'm with you', 'meet you there', 'addicted', 'one day', and 'perfect'.  the remainings songs are great too!  get this cd, you'll love it.<br />(and if you wait about a minute after 'grow up', you'll here there christmas song 'my christmas list')
B00008X5J3|5.0|First, I'm not a real big fan of musicals.  Second, I usually would pass on a drama.  Nope, do NOT pass.<br />The acting was great, and although it's a musical, the plot was exceptional.  This is a must see.
B000002N2N|5.0|There are 28 tracks on this CD. \\"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\\" is something of a dead spot in the middle. [Joey spends a record 10 seconds introducing it - which is bad sign.] \\"We're A Happy Family\\" is kind of a downer as a closing number. [All the more so in retrospect - now that we know what a very unhappy family Joey and Johnny would spend the next 20 years being.] And you know how live rock performances always end with a drawn out series of cymbal crashes over a sustained chord while the band tries to catch its breath for a relatively synchronized finish? \\"Today Your Love, Tomorrow The World\\" ends with a Ramonishly brief version of that which - though perhaps meant as a parody - has its inherent lameness underscored with a thick black permanent marker by the whip-crack conclusion of every other song. [When these numbers end, they *end*.] <br /> <br />What makes this the greatest live rock recording of all time - even to a fairly indifferent Ramones fan like myself - is that every single one of the other 25 numbers is like having a hypo full of adrenaline spiked directly into your heart. Wherever the pogo center of the brain is, these chords - played at these manic levels of energy and focus - jack straight into it. <br /> <br />Now that's one king hell of a show right there. But when it really peaks - which, to my mind, it does no less than three times: \\"California Sun\\", \\"Do You Wanna Dance?\\", and \\"Oh Oh I Love Her So\\" - it transports you for an average of 1 minute and 40 seconds into a vision of that rock-and-roll Heaven of youth, vitality, and romance that the great Phil Spector singles were always about. <br /> <br />Very well done, boys. You're missed.
080010367X|5.0|Science fiction isn't my favorite genre.  However, throw some comedy in there and you've got yourselves a movie.<br />Will Smith plays a cop recruited by the Men In Black.  Although the comedy is only once in a while, it's hilarious when it hits you.  I think they should have let him crack a few more jokes like in MIB II.  Of course, a lot of the humour in that is ......<br />Tommy Lee Jones.  You think he would be too old or something.  He happens to be the best choice.  Actually, come to think of it, Robert DeNero... ah, never mind.  Jones does a great job acting.  However, he lacks in expression [Think Keanu Reeves{Not really that bad}].<br />The special effects are spectacular, from the weird alien dude in the guy's body, to the alien without the guy's body, the FX never fail.<br />I bought this movie and finished it a couple days ago.  I was taking a chance buying it.  I'm so glad I did.  This is one of my favorite movies.<br />Also, check out my so you want to watch a good comedy movie thing.
B00008H2LE|2.0|All I can say.... is that Linkin Park got a hold of ProTools and ran with it. ProTools is computer aided audio editing and mixing. It's a wonderful tool, but I attribute it's heavy use in this song like bands used synthesizers in the 80s.... way over used. This album lacks in play time and it lacks in strong lyrics. I hope their next one, if there is a next one is better.
B00004SZWD|4.0|Songs In The Key Of Life is great album featuring so many good songs. The compositions are great, the production is flawless and the arrangements are top notch however when it comes to Double Albums some of them will contain fillers. This one does.<br />Not that many songs on this album aren´t good. 80% of this album is brilliant. However some of the tracks don´t seem to belong there in the mix. Though lyrically they´re good. musically they don´t float and are often boring and I just wan´t to skip the track and go to the next one.<br />Other than that. Stevie Wonder created a fantastic album and if he had skipped some of these tracks he would have recieved 5 stars.
B00005JLO2|5.0|This movie gave me a whole new perspective on friendships and how they can pull you through even the worst times. Harry Faversham's loyalty to his friends is incredible! The last fight Harry has in the desert will leave you on the edge of your seat! The costumes, scenery and acting is MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you love period movies, movies that engross and inspire you your sure to LOVE  this movie!!!!!!!!<BR>What are you waiting for? Get this movie or rent it today!!!!!!!!!
B00005QGAZ|3.0|Thriller was released in december 1982. In january it was certified Platinum and a month later Billie Jean topped the billboard hot 100 for several weeks and then the album topped the charts for 37 weeks and by the end of 1984 it had sold 35 million copies world-wide ( over 20 million in the US) becoming the biggest selling Album of all time. Today Thriller has sold 51 million copies world-wide ( over 26 million in the US) and still holds the record ( not in the US). <br />But as Thriller is the biggest selling album of all time and many people love it. Is it as good as everyone thinks it is. Not really.<br />It has some of the all time greatest pop tracks but some of the songs on this album are either bad, dated or just silly.<br />The Girl Is Mine for example . The first single is one of the most annoying songs I´ve ever heard in my life. Hearing Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney fighting for some woman is stupid. I mean when they´re talking its like Paul was talking to a woman.<br />They should re-release the album and put Say Say in it instead.<br />P.Y.T. Another track which souldn´t have been on the album. Oveproduced and not very what I would say classic. Monica has just sampled it for her new album which has not been released.<br />The Lady In My Life. the last song on the album is also a song that isn´t what I would say classic nor brilliant by any means.<br />the other trakcs on this album are good ( Billy Jean, Thriller, Beat It, Wanne Be Startin Something, Human Nature) the song Baby Be Mine is decent.<br /> but this album doesn´t exite me or is in my top 100 for the best albums of all time. It is also not half as good as its predeseccor Off The Wall which was indeed a masterpiece and Michael has never followed it artistically.
B000068GA4|5.0|From the bluesy grind album by the same nefarious name, comes the video sequal. The same kind of disturbing artistry arrrays this visual velocity of diabolism. Unlike the first production, in its dark & gloomy countenance, LUCIFUGE-THE VIDEO is in full color, though still mostly basked in shadows. The word \\"Lucifuge\\" is the prime Minister of the demonic heigharchy of Black Magick, whose last name is Rafocale.<br />Love the cover. We see displayed Glen's facial image imposed with that of a wolf's. A greatrepresentation of the Satanimal Dracomnium. Worthy to enlarge & frame.<br />Once again, the devilish visions dance across the screen, to the eerie echoings of heavy guitars. DEVIL'S PLAYTHING begins, with an introduction from BLACK ARIA, we are out in the foreast amidst a raging fire, & a hooded figure is revealed by a damsel so faire. I'M THE ONE rakes place in the swamplands, & in a graveyards, where the alligators & crocodiles await the tread of some poor prey. KILLER WOLF can be found in the desolate outskirts, where Nature, in its darkness, is overgrown & plush. What unfortunate wayfarer shall make their way into the haunted lands? Finally, she comes down into oblivion, to snatch the soul, then, one is UNDER HER BLACK WINGS, enslaved or liberated by the demoness of forbidden lusts.........<br />In between the songs, we get to peer into the different personalities of Danzig, where we see Chuck Bisquits conversing eloquently upon the subject of breakfast cereals, especially the elusive & mysterious Count Chocula {no longer elusive}, Frankenberry, Booberry, & Quisp. Enigmas in the world of culinary delights. All in typical Chuck Bisquits etiquette ----- the playful imp, a-la resident Munster on the band, like his attitude crawled out of Halloweentown.<br />Glenn runs amongst the wolves to a piece from Black Aria, & late conjures the spechtre of a gorgeous ghostess, who hands him Milton's Paradise Lost, from which he reads a sample.<br />I would have liked the video to have been longer, but alas, it ends too soon, but it was definitely worth the ride.video to have been longer, but alas, it ends too soon, but it was definitely worth the ride.
B00001U03Q|2.0|Considering that this compilation only covers Eric Clapton's career after 1981, I suppose I can't complain too much about the choice of material. But it is still painful to hear former \\"God\\" Clapton ape Michael Jackson on \\"Change The World\\"...he might as well have been singing \\"Heal The World\\" while trying to keep his nose in place, and his older material, which consists mainly of slick pop-rockers and lounge-like ballads, is overproduced and sounds lifeless and bland.<BR>If you are just looking for a single-disc compilation, go for \\"The Cream of Clapton\\", which, although not perfect, is much, much better.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have to say that I've been REALLY bored with music these days, feeling like everyone sounds like everyone else.  THIS is exactly what I've been waiting for.  It's Sarah McLaughin gone goth and it sounds incredible. Amy Lee has one of the most amazingly powerful, hypnotic, haunting and addicting voices I've ever heard.  I didn't want to turn the CD off.
0385504209|5.0|This is the best intellectual thriller in a long time.  This book has it all....murder, mystery, religion, art history, and puzzle solving.  I immediately went to danbrown.com to check out the actual photos of the places and paintings he discusses in his novel.  I've recommended this one to all my friends.  Don't wait for the paperback!

B00008H2LB|3.0|i had a choice between buying evanescence or linkin park, and since i have been a devoted fan of LP for the past two years, i bought meteora. it wasn't completely bad, but not as captivating as Hybrid Theory which i fell in love with. On Hybrid Theory every song was distinctive and original, and the songs on Meteora just seemed so copy-cat. it took me at least 10-15 times to get some sort of \\"feel\\" for the album. i wasn't exactly blown away. the only notable songs on Meteora were \\"Somewhere I belong\\", \\"Don't Stay\\" \\"Faint\\" and \\"Numb\\". however, even with these songs i bear a longing for the sharp-razor beats of \\"Papercut\\", the clashing of \\"Forgotten\\" and \\"Runaway\\" and many other terrific songs on Hybrid Theory.
B0000640VO|4.0|I am telling a lie if I say I leave this movie feeling inspired to take on the world, or to make anyone's life better; I am telling a lie if I say this movie grabs my hearstrings and never lets go until the end credits roll; however, I am certainly telling the truth when I say this is possibly the most intelligent...clever...well-written movie I have ever seen.<br />The casting is, in my opinion, absolutely flawless; the script is incredibly intricate and intelligent; I still find no fault in the editing; and for the entire duration of the film, I find myself laughing out loud, feeling as if I am truly back in Paris, living in Amelie's world...<br />...it doesn't carry the emotional rush of Braveheart or Amistad (for me, at least), but I think this filmy certainly provides a light-heartedness that is very necessary in all of our lives. It's truly a feel-good story, and it definitely succeeds in being such.  I watch it over and over and am entertained every time.<br />The DVD also actually has good features, something that can be surpirsingly lacking on some DVDs; I particularly enjoyed seeing the audition of Ms. Tautou, found the interviews to be decently informative, and (as an amateur photographer) was quite interested in the explanation of the brilliant colour schemes.<br />Overall, I give the disc 4.5 stars.
B00005KA9F|3.0|Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones star as a pair of world class thieves who join forces under confusing circumstances to pull off two very impressive heists.  Throughout the film, we're never quite sure of each one's motives since there is a general tone of &quot;all is not what it seems.&quot;  The preparation for the capers and the capers themselves are the highlights of the film.  They have enough suspense and technical wizardry and gadgets to entertain the viewer.  But Connery and Zeta-Jones have little chemistry together, and their relationship strains credibility far more than the capers do.  Maury Chaykin plays a strange crime kingpin in Malaysia, but the character is barely used and ill-defined.  This script needed another re-write and perhaps a more stylish director.  It's an interesting film, but not a very good one.
B00005JLZ9|5.0|This movie sets up in the beginning like your typical army action flick that is heavy on violence but light on plot lines or character development.  Surprisingly the opposite turned out to be the case.  If you like to be surprised a la Costners' No Way Out, then you will really like this movie and the stories within stories.  This movie could easily be the surprise of the winter season.
0887081770|5.0|Wouldn't it be wonderful to get the moon?!!  Well you can in this charming book.  My 3 year old loves it.  Pages open up to further discribe how far away the moon really is.  My daughter is always looking for the moon.. jumping ... trying to get it :)
B00005V3Z4|4.0|If I could watch fate being drawn by a silver beam I'd follow hot chicks wherever they went.  This kid has some neato powers and it makes for an intense movie.  The character that ran off the Sesame Street set, was the funniest thing to hit the theater since the crew members of Saved by The Bell believed they could transfer to film.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and the adventure.  Sure, it doesn't make much sense, but anyone willing to give up superpowers for his family and friends is a super-hero in my book.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Hi, I live in India and I just saw this movie last week. It a wonderful movie and the the music is so entertaining. Zeta Jones performance is great. No wonder this film has won 6 Oscars. Its a best family movie too.
0440180295|4.0|This novel can be broken down into three principal stories, much like the film Pulp Fiction.  The struggling writer, Kilgore Trout, meets his only fan who happens to be as crazy as himself after living as a hermit.  The passive hero of World War II, Billy Pilgrim, ..., and the aliens from Transfalmadore who cause the destruction of the universe.  Together, these three entities create, the greatest anti-war novel?  Yea, crazy enough, this book has nothing to do with these stories.  Much like Pulp Fiction, there is a deeper message that resounds off a funny and edgy premise.  I won't delve further into details because I'm lazy and most people won't read this.  However, for those who are looking for their next novel, I assure you this is it.  Getting past the first few pages of meandering is easy and all phrases are important and used for a reason.  Unfortunately, I had to explian to my mother what, \\"So it goes,\\" meant.  Reading this will not only enhance your lovelife, it will reaffirm your belief in aliens.  Peace, and may these three short films follow you to the door.
0920668364|1.0|The fact of the matter is there are two types of crowds for this book:  You either love it or hate it.  I fall in the latter group for many reasons. The people who love it will love it forever.  Others, like me, will never \\"get it\\".  NEVER.<br />First of all the art is ugly.  There I've said it. It's just downright poorly done.  Enlarge the cover and see for yourself!  That child looks scary, not cute. But that's the least of this books downfalls.<br />Secondly the mother is, as other reviewers pointed out, weirdly obsessive and downright creepy in her devotion to her son.  She crawls across his floor when he's a teenager and stalks him as an adult.  Ew.  It's just really bizarre. Sappy is one word for it, but there are other words for it as well...like psychotic.<br />Now, I'm not saying that the people who like this are insane.  They fell for the \\"a[...] are so giving and loving\\" line the book dishes out.  But there are less disturbing and better illustrated books out there to buy!  Runaway Bunny for starters or Guess How Much I Love You (SO MUCH BETTER).<br />The theme is one of the most common in children's literature. There are more healthy approaches to the topic in my opinion. This book is wildly popular.  But that doesn't mean it's any good.

B00005U122|3.0|I found this show to be boring in parts. I find stuff like &quot;in the flesh&quot;, &quot;money&quot;, &quot;shine on...&quot;, &quot;comfortably numb&quot; , etc, to be rather overplayed by Pink Floyd and Roger and it would be good to hear totally different tracks never before attempted live. I also think there are songs that Roger should stay away from such as &quot;Wish you were here&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Shine on..&quot; etc, because he just cant sing them properly, they were sung by Gilmour originally. He does have particular band members singing tracks such as &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Dogs&quot; etc, but why go down that road, it may as well be a PF cover band in that case. Having said all that, he made a good job of &quot;Southhampton dock&quot; and some of his solo stuff but it would have been such a treat to hear a few more tracks from The final cut and more from his solo stuff.

B00005LK95|5.0|This movie has been my favorite movie for years. In the first movie Number 5 or Johnny 5 was viewed more as a prop than a character. I'm not dissing the first movie!... In Short Circuit 2, Johnny 5 knows he is alive, but he struggles throughout the film trying to prove it to the rest of the world.<BR>There are many emotion through out the film. Most of it is just humor!
0385504209|5.0|What amazed me about this book was the fact that Brown uses the thriller genre, where every chapter ends in a cliffhanger that leaves you breathless, but it's jam packed with fascinating historical nuggets, ALL of which serve to drive the plot and keep the reader guessing. It's a dozen puzzles within a dozen puzzles, but all of them clearly logical and based on ancient paintings, writings and historical facts. Just when you think he's said something ludicrous, you go to the painting or edifice named and it's all there.<br />And though he demonstrates how much of the Church is based on myth -- all thoroughly documented -- he manages to do it without being sacrigilous or mean-spirited. Once I started reading, I could not stop and had to finish it. A perfect blend of pop adventure and deeply intellectual research. It all fits and it doesn't cheat. Brilliant.
6305882592|5.0|I find an interesting dichotomy in those who love and those who dislike this film--the former tend to listen to the lessons and feel the love behind them, while the latter tend not to like to be &quot;told what to do,&quot; as if the lessons in this film are heavy-handed orders that must be obeyed to lead a happy life.  The truth is that Harold and Maude are extreme versions of very realistic characters--Harold, the fatherless young man with a domineering mother who never has learned to live life on his own terms, and Maude, the concentration-camp survivor who has learned that life is what you make of it, and we shouldn't let our conditions or circumstances determine who we are or how we look at life.  Together, they're just what each other needs, and they help each other to learn what they need to learn.  If you want to enjoy this film--and it is a marvelous film--you have to let go of expectations and let the characters be exactly who they are, and not get disappointed when they aren't what we'd like them to be or when they don't do what we expect them to do.  That's the true beauty of this film--it demands that we let go, just as Maude's character has learned to let go of expectations that everything follow the &quot;norms&quot; of our society.
B00004Z459|5.0|I will admit I used to bash LP all the time. That was before I actually listended to the cd though. I heard the songs over and over on the radio and got tired of them therefore I hated the band. I wasn't realizing that they actually were quite good. I listended to my friends cd at his house and found myself singing to it. The cd is very addictive and catchy. Also the songs are very well written from a lyrical and musical perspective. In the End is perhaps the best song on the album but I also like papercut. Overall, this release was very good especially if you could look past all the radio play and not get tired of the songs.
B00005JLK1|4.0|I never saw this movie in the theaters.  Not much time to go to theaters especially when friends cannot go with me.  So, I dont really know if the movie would have been different for me (for better or worse).  Actually, I got the movie yesterday.  And I have to say, I like it.  It is not too bad of a movie.<br />I was first introduced to these fellows from House on Haunted Hill.  At first I hated that movie, I thought it was aweful.  Then I watched it a few times and it just kinda clicked to me.  Then I saw Thirteen Ghosts (another remake movie).  It was interesting in the theater, I bought the video and saw it a few more times and decided.  Again.  I liked it.<br />Now this movie.  Hm.  Well yes its not the most original movie out there.  Then again, what is?  I mean, a haunted house is a haunted house, whether its on Gilligan's Island or in Lovecraft's Arkham.<br />Still.  I have to say I like this movie.  It has some obviously wonderful gore effects that are &quot;enjoyable&quot; for their ingenuity. Especially the first scene where ohhhh some 80 or more people got slit in half.  Then there are some more interesting gore effects later on.<br />To me, while there are enough cliche's out there, an effective horror movie is one that captivates me instead of just watching it when I hear the women scream (and guys lol) on the screen.  The movies from Dark Castle, from Haunted Hill to this, are not known for their newness but how they manipulate the old stories into new ways of saying &quot;boo&quot;.<br />If you want to relax after a hard day from work and see a horror movie that you dont have to think every turn of the script while also being captivated enough to see what happens to each character, sure, buy this.  I think it was worth the twenty some bucks I spent.<br />I myself will be interested to see what these people pop out next.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki really scored with this one. If you don't know him by name, he is the man who's brought us such classics as Princess Mononoke and My Neighbor Totoro. Spirited Away looks great on the big screen, and that's where it belongs. However, the dubbing by Disney isn't that great, I'm sorry to say. No need to worry, though, as the DVD edition contains the original Japanese! This movie is a must-own for any movie lover, and certainly and anime lover. I give it a six out of five!
B00000IWVS|4.0|Having been touted (branded) as legendary, this recording has drawn many classical listeners' attention. I admit that her technical superiority is intensively shown in this recording. It's clear that she plays the music with passion. But is this particular recording good enough to be glorified to this extent? Not really. I do appreciate this particular CD because it accounts for the musicality of early Martha Argerich. But I think that, in this CD, Argerich plays without much consideration. I am a fan of Argerich, and I appreciate her thundering power most of the time. But I think playing chopin needs a sense of manipulation, which allows a performer to empathize with the music and the composer. It seems that, if taking out the melody, what left, the only thing left, is her strength. I believe that her recordings under the label of DG are much better. For example, in her 1961 debute recording, the &quot;Scherzo No.3 In C-sharp Minor, Op.39&quot; is played with much more consideration because what she puts in the music is not only strength but also her understanding of the music. Also, I think that EMI's recording technic is not good. I can't believe my ears that the 1961 recording with DG has a much higher audio quality than this 1965 recording.
6305897786|1.0|Its been a while since my GF and I fell victim to this movie, thinking from the ads and previews we were in for a good, dark, horror movie.<br />Well, we WERE horrified, I'll grant the movie that much--but not as a result of plot or action or atmosphere or anything...you know, ESSENTIAL to creating any sort of tension and fear.<br />No...what sticks out in my mind, looking back about this movie is the sheer, ungodly amount of screentime the director spent filming traffic scenes.  Not car chases, mind you, but slow, speed-limit and under, normal traffic.  Every moment of one character's journey from one location to another, all painstakingly documented for posterity.  Nothing too mundane for this movie to show, by God!<br />I started commenting about it in the theater.  Since we were almost alone in the theater, no one seemed to mind--it helped break the coma-like atmosphere.<br />\\"WHOA!  Hot merging into traffic action!  Spare us nothing, movie!!!\\"<br />\\"Oh my God.  They're going over 20 miles per hour now.  Hold onto your seats folks!\\"<br />\\"Will he or won't he use the turn signal???  Inquiring minds want to know!!!\\"<br />You can probably guess the rest.<br />Oh yeah.  Johnny Depp was in this movie.  Kinda.  I know a lot of people comment on his abilities as an actor, and say he was low-key in this film on purpose, but it doesnt strike me as too terribly difficult to act like you're hung over and sleepy after a weekend bender.  Considering he was like that for practically the whole of the film, that must have been some bender!<br />In short--I would like to demand the time in my life that I spent watching this movie back, please.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This is a great CD. Definite &quot;must have&quot; if you like the 80's or Pet Shop Boys.
B00000K2UX|5.0|One of the definitive and best-selling soundtracks of the 1980's was the Top Gun soundtrack.  It yielded two Top Five singles, one in the Top Twenty, and two in the bottom half of the charts.  With the success of the first two singles, the soundtrack took off without needing any help from the other three.<br />The racing rocker \\"Danger Zone\\" evokes an image of F-14s soaring through the air and cements Kenny Loggins' reputation as that guy who did soundtrack songs (Caddyshack, Footloose, Over The Top).  This is definitely his best soundtrack song.  The searing guitar solo he does after the bridge is just hot.<br />Cheap Trick's \\"Mighty Wings\\" is a thematic rocker in keeping pace with the movie when Robin Zander and company implores: \\"Take me on your mighty wings and fly.\\"  This shouldn't have flopped in the bottom 50 of the Hot 100.  Both this song and \\"Danger Zone\\" is refreshing for long car trips.<br />It's the song afterwards, a mild rocker titled \\"Playing With The Boys\\", by Mr. Loggins, that is good, but none one of his best.<br />With 80's synthesizers blaring, Teena Marie performs the 80's dance pop of \\"Lead Me On.\\"  A similar sound and voice is present in \\"Destination Unknown\\" by Marietta.  No, this isn't the Missing Persons number.  Teena Marie had enough songs to have a greatest hits CD, but whatever happened to Marietta?<br />Berlin's \\"Take My Breath Away\\" was one of those immortal love themes for movies, highlighted by Terri Nunn's vocals.  Since I first heard it on radio and MTV, I never got sick of it.<br />Compared to the material on their first two albums, \\"Hot Summer Nights\\" by Miami Sound Machine is totally a throwaway dance song, but at least it's better than when Gloria Estefan overshadowed the machine and turned her back on Cuban dance pop to disco.<br />\\"Heaven In Your Eyes\\" by the Vancouver-based group Loverboy is a prime and splendid example of a power ballad, which should've done better than the #12 peak on the Billboard singles chart.  Mike Reno really lets it rip in the last line of the bridge:  \\"Oh this feeling inside, in your eyes\\" before that wailing guitar kicks in.<br />\\"Through The Fire\\" by Larry Greene, another artist who I'm not sure made any other songs, has a rock guitar nearly as crunchy as \\"Danger Zone\\" but overlaced with synthesizers to produce that 80's rock-synthesizer sound.  His voice kind of reminds me of a restrained version of Jimi Jameson of Survivor.<br />Harold Faltermeyer (\\"Axel F\\") and Steve Steven (Billy Idol's shaggy-haired guitarist) do the instrumental \\"Top Gun Anthem,\\" a splendid power-ballad type marriage of keyboard synthesizer and piercing electric guitar.  \\"Memories\\", the sad elegiac instrumental, which I assume was played when Maverick mourns his best friend's death.<br />As for the five additional songs, the three 60's classics work to the point that it's more of a complete soundtrack, although it's kind of jarring for those used to having the album end with \\"Top Gun Anthem.\\"  The 6:41 dance mix of \\"Playing With The Boys\\" is a welcome addition, but that's because it was remixed by Jellybean Benitez, Madonna's pre-Sean Penn boyfriend?<br />The CD sleeves includes an interview with Top Gun's producer Jerry Bruckheimer and his fond recollections.  According to him, it's difficult doing a soundtrack with certain artists in mind because they might have other obligations.  The key is getting the songwriters to do the songs, then approaching the artists whenever they're free.  Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock were real assets here, considering they wrote the songs done by Berlin, Teena Marie, Larry Greene, and Kenny Loggins' \\"Danger Zone.\\"  Still, the perfect example of a packaged soundtrack that's actually good.eno really lets it rip in the last line of the bridge:  \\"Oh this feeling inside, in your eyes\\" before that wailing guitar kicks in.<br />\\"Through The Fire\\" by Larry Greene, another artist who I'm not sure made any other songs, has a rock guitar nearly as crunchy as \\"Danger Zone\\" but overlaced with synthesizers to produce that 80's rock-synthesizer sound.

0790749815|5.0|This movie can be considered as a predecessor to the James Bond films. A 'secert agent' dress up in a suit, who relies more on his wit than his physical power. Beautiful woman who fall in love with him. International villains who want him dead... You name it, they have it! Although this film is old, but it had aged very well.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|Beauty And The Beast is one of my favorite Disney movies, I don't like it as much as I like The Little Mermaid, Snow White Or Cinderella but it is a very good Disney movie and is one of my favorites and it's in my top 5 and it's worth owning the DVD and watching all of the different versions of it and it has some good extras though I didn't enjoy all of the extras, if you are a fan of Disney movies I recommend this DVD for your collection!
B00003CXUM|5.0|Intellectual films are usually not Hong Kong's strong point.  But whenever it produce a gem like this one, it roars!  Personally I think it's a very well crafted set period film.  It's got a very nostalgia quality to it.  Definitely very representative of the Hong Kong in the 60's and 70's.
080013558X|4.0|I liked both this movie and the play, yes it's kind of annoying that they didn't use several cute songs from the play and when I first saw this movie I was disappointed but over the years I have grown to like the movie even more even if I wish it included the missing songs and I have to say that even though the play was good some of the reviewers here who loved the play and hated this movie are making the play out to be something totally amazing, yes it's good but it's not absolutely fantastic like Les Miserables, The Phantom of the Opera, Miss Siagon, Cats, but that's just my personal opinion.
B00008H2LE|1.0|Linkin Park is a modern pop-rock band, and as such, they have to cater to a certain need in order to sell albums. Their first album, while showing no musical talent at all, displayed enough pop hooks and the right blend of guitars and rap-rock vocals to do very well and cash in on the rap-rock fad.<br />This album, however, is a disgrace in many ways. First of all, in the 3 years it took to come up with a sophomore release, Linkin Park was only able to put together 36 minutes of music. Sure, their fans have little attention span, but this is ridiculous. I could buy the 36 minutes if it actually showed progress from their first release, but they just rehash the exact same themes ad nauseum.  Which brings me to my second point - there isn't any significant progression.  They have the same pseudo-teen angst lyrics to poor turntable work and sloppy and simplistic guitar riffs.  Do something new.<br />And, finally, there is just alot of music out there that is infinitely better than this, yet this will be a platinum album.  This album should be proof to everyone of how poor the record industry really is.
B00008H2LE|5.0|there's really nothing to complain about this album.  it is a little short, but that's fine cuz they didn't waste space with something stupid.  i really didn't like the sound of it at first, because it sounded a bit different from the first.  and i loved hybrid theory, so i wasn't ready to except that.  but now i love it, and i feel that it has a more mature sound to it.  there's also a lot of interesting sounds to it...but it makes it unique.  i would highly recommend it.
B00005AR3G|5.0|Awesome movie! Something that the entire family can enjoy for sure, ...just absolutely adore this movie. David Spade and John Goodman did a wonderful job with these Characters! Great Flick!
B00008BXJJ|5.0|I am not a AC/DC fan and just got attracted by the package as stated as newly remastered. I listened to it at Borders music and compared the sound quality to the previous remastered copy. You guess what is my action? If i would hv owned the old remastered, I will never hesitiate to get this new copy. It sounds so great and the songs are just fantastic. I am hoping that the record company would rlse one box set with all the latest remastered AC/DC so I don't hv to rush to get them one by one. Enjoy the music...you won't go wrong. Go get all!!!
B000002I27|5.0|This is one of the best door's album's in my opinion.<BR>I'd say the most popular song's on here would have to<BR>be,Strange day's,Moonlight drive,Love me 2 time's,When <BR>the music's over and People are strange.Musically and<BR>lyrically this is some of the best music that the Doors<BR>had ever written.For every Door's fan I highly reccomend<BR>for you to own this album,it's a classic and a masterpiece.<BR>In my opinion you should own all the Door's album's,they <BR>are all classic's.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I can honestly say this is one of the best albums of the year. Gone are the cheesy teen-directed songs lacking substance from before (probably due to Christina's lack of involveent in the writing process), and in their place stands a powerful piece of personal and beautiful music.<br />1)Stripped pt. 1 - nice intro to the album, lets the listener know what she's all about<br />2)Can't Hold Us Down - very catchy hip-hop female empowerment song, stuck in my head right now<br />3)Walk Away - beautiful piano-driven ballad, C's emotive voice makes this one great<br />4)Fighter - 3rd single, rocker w/ attitude, fun song<br />5)Primer Amor(interlude) - not very necessary, but relatively harmless<br />6)Infatuation - light, spanish guitar driven pop song, most reminiscent of her earlier work<br />7)Loves Embrace (interlude) - unnecessary again, but ok<br />8)Loving Me 4 Me - one of the best songs on the album, neo-soul in the vein of Jill Scott, C explores her not often used upper register<br />9)Impossible - Alicia Keys' contribution, has an old school kind of jazzy feel to it, strong vocals from C<br />10)Underappreciated - ok song, sounds like it could have been taken from En Vogue's \\"Funky Divas\\" album<br />11)Beautiful - 2nd single, great song, great words, great message<br />12)Makeover - C turns into Courtney Love for a moment, totally new territory for her, well done<br />13)Cruz - fantastic song w/ Linda Perry, these kind of anthems only come along if an artist is lucky<br />14)Soar - alright song, tends to blend in for me but is still worthy<br />15)Get Mine, Get Yours - r&b flavored song about sex, sounds like something off \\"J.Lo\\", but some fluff doesn't hurt<br />16)Dirrty - 1st single, club favorite, Rockwilder's production is interesting, good contribution from Redman, overall a well-crafted dirty dance song<br />17)Stripped pt. 2 - C is just keepin it real<br />18)The Voice Within - Very much a Glenn Ballard tune, nice message, total diva personal power anthem<br />19)I'm Ok - broken-voiced diary entry from C, Linda Perry is good at helping divas explore their darkness (she did it with Pink with amazing results too)<br />20)Keep on Singin' My Song - nice closer, gospel-driven hope ballad<br />Overall, this is a great album that explores a lot of different genres. If you're a fan of music with meaning and emotion behind it, be sure to pick this one up.
6302150930|5.0|I saw the film when it came out and bought it when it came out on VHS to add to my VHS collection.  The movie is Roman Polanski's best by far.  Ms. Kinski, who was quite young when she made the film, gave a performance that excells many of today's seasoned actresses. The music (ah, the hauntingly beautiful music) by Sarde is a gem, as well as the lush scenary.  The A&amp;E production of Tess that came out in 1998 was very good, but it can't hold a candle to this one!
B00006LSM3|5.0|This album is fantastic. I really can't think of any other words to describe it. Altough this is George's final album released one year after his death, I am sure this brilliant music will live on forever. From the opening of \\"Any Road\\" to the bitterness of \\"Brainwashed,\\" George shows everyone how great an artist he really was. This whole album is great, but \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" and \\"Looking For My Life\\" are standout tracks. I would recommend this album to all, not just Beatles fans.
B00007FOMP|5.0|1971...fresh faced college student new to the big city...cheap stereo filling a walkup apartment spilling \\"Whats Going On\\"  into the street below, \\"war is not the answer, only love can conquer hate...\\" Different war, higher floor, expensive stereo, but Marvin's words are still spilling into the street below to be trampled and ignored like spring tulips puncturing cold concrete...
0425098478|5.0|A quick read because the concepts it describes are simple yet powerful.  &quot;The One Minute Manager&quot; has evolved into a management classic since its first edition in 1981.  Managers will take three precepts from this book:  Efficient Goal Setting with employees, Praise, and Reprimands.  In other words, make sure your people know precisely what they are to do, and then give them feedback whether they meet those expectations or not.  That's it.  Simple and effective.  It takes an hour to read &quot;The One Minute Manager&quot;, consider it an investment.
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you're contemplating on whether or not to buy or see this film take a look at the other reviews. Only about five people gave it less than 4 stars (-and when you find them check out how many other people found that entry useful). If you're an adult without children you can still find this movie remarkably interesting; however, if you've lost your inner child or if you're dead inside you might just come out of the theater bewildered or disappointed. This is NO Princess Mononoke. Miyasaki wasn't aiming for another serious film.<br />In my oppinion, this movie has something to offer to almost everyone. Some conservative parents might find it a bit morbid or scary for kids but if your children are permanently traumatized by it than they must have had some issues to begin with. Loosen up and keep an open-mind to this masterpeice.
B000002KY8|4.0|Prince's 1999 CD is a super dance recording with many spunky beats.  Everyone knows about the classic hits 1999 and Little Red Corvette.  But what about the fabuluous CD closer International Lover?  Love the rap effect where Prince is in airplane in love.  Cool sexy lyrics indeed.<br />There are many other winning tracks on here such as Lady Cab Driver, Free, and D.M.S.R.  Many of the eleven tracks are on the long side.  Automatic is the most trying one of these as the melody surely does not justify its 9:24 length.  All The Critics Love U In New York somewhat overstays its welcome even though it is a bit more tuenful.<br />Nonetheless, my complaints are relatively minor.  This is a very solid CD which will get any party hopping.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Okay, I'll start off by saying I like this CD a lot, just as much as I liked the first.  I'd consider them equal, one isn't really better than the other, but that isn't a complaint!  It is really very short, which disappointed me, but it's worth the buy.<br />Foreword: 13 seconds of weirdness.<br />Don't Stay:  Not a bad song, good rap/rock combination, but not one of my very favs.  Three and a half stars.<br />Somewhere I Belong:  I really like this song.  It's a song you can really get into--very cool!  Five stars.<br />Lying from you:  Good song with nice lyrics and beat.  Four and a half stars<br />Hit the Floor:  One of my favorite.  The group is at their best here.  The rap is hightly captivating, with intervals of singing.  You can't help but sing along.  Five stars.<br />Easier to Run:  I don't hate it, but it's not all that great. The softer stuff just isn't them.  Two stars.<br />Faint:  It's okay.  A good song, but not great.  Three and a half stars.<br />Figure.09: My comments are basically the same as for the song above, but this song is better.  Four stars.<br />Breaking the Habit:  Another of my favorites.  Different, but very cool.  The six years they spent on it were well worth it.  Five stars.<br />From the Inside:  Not my favorite, but not bad.  Three and a half stars.<br />Nobody's Listening:  My other favorite.  The combo of rap lyrics and the Japanese flute gives it a different, enthralling sound.  Five stars.<br />Session:  Sort of weird.  I think I liked their first instrumental song better, it had a better beat.  Three stars.<br />Numb:  Three stars.  Another of my not-so-favorites.<br />All in all, this album is worth buying if you were a fan of the first one, but it isn't better or worse.<br />--DW24
1577311523|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has written a book that is crystal clear, and packed with wisdom. I have been studying it now for two weeks, and listening to the book on tape as well. The concepts presented are not new, but they are articulated in ways that make them much more easy to understand than anything else I have read on this topic.<br />And, contrary to what some of the other reviews state, he offers several simple practices that WILL have profound effects in your life if you actually try them out. <br />Simply accepting what the present moment contains \\"as if you chose it,\\" will alter every relationship you have, and can free you from being taken over by emotional reactions (having your buttons pushed). This one concept has transformed the quality of my life signficantly in a very short time. And it's so simple, if you're willing to just try it. <br />Tolle states that until you have had enough suffering, you won't likely be able to hear this message for what it is. So, if you feel like you're ready to be free of emotional and psychological suffering for good, then you need to read this book NOW. It does have the power to truly change your life.
B000089RVX|5.0|This band has done it. The music has a wide variety, going from soothing music to upbeat rock. CDs usually contain a couple of songs that are great, but this cd breaks that rule and is filled with amazing songs that are really catchy. <br />Tthe angelic voice of Amy Lee completes the cd. I'd have to say that I haven't heard a cd like this in a long time. Every single song is packed with great musicianship. <br />The only bad thing about this cd is that you'll be using up all your batteries in your cd player listening to it time and time again. :)<br />This is definately worth buying. #1

0345440900|1.0|I was recommended this book by an aquaintance and I can't imagine why!  It is very preachy and judgemental of other points of view.  It reminds me of jaded organized religions that can't just believe what they believe, they have to rant about other people's perspectives.  No one person has all the answers, I like to pick and choose what I agree with, not be told by someone else why it's wrong.

B00005O3VC|5.0|The wondrously clever and hilariously entertaining Monty Python style is at its peak in this movie, the greatest single work of the rich MP tradition. Each scene boldly goes for the weirdest laughs, never bothering with the overrated idea of consistency. When seeing it with a first-timer, I must stop myself from making comments such as &quot;I love this part!&quot; before literally every scene in the movie. This comedy is unique, extremely odd, absolutely fantastic. This movie is a joy.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|\\"The Straight Story\\" has the gorgeously colored, semi-surreal look of a typical David Lynch movie, but here the surrealism is lyrical and benign. There are no armies of insects fighting to the death underneath the amber wheatfields, no severed ears in the pristine woods. The overweight next-door neighbor, sunning herself while eating pastel-colored Hostess snowballs, may look weird, but she's perfectly nice. As the title implies, this is the \\"straight\\" and deceptively simple story based on the true tale of Alvin Straight, an elderly Iowa man who, hearing that his long-estranged brother has had a stroke, wants to go to Wisconsin and mend fences with him. Too incapacitated himself to drive a car, he hitches a trailer to his riding lawn mower and spends five weeks driving the 300 miles along country roads to his brother's house. That's all there is to it, but it's incredibly moving, thanks to Freddie Francis' gorgeous photography of the Midwest countryside and Lynch's poetic direction. Above all, what makes this movie worth seeing is the exquisite, deeply moving performance of Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight. Silent for long stretches of the film, Farnsworth tells the story of Straight's life mainly through his eyes, showing a world of stubborn decency and bitter regret. When Farnsworth does speak--such as his monologue in a bar about his World War II experiences as a sniper--you will never forget it. There is only one recent screen performance that is at all like Farnsworth's--Adrien Brody's in \\"The Pianist.\\" There is also Sissy Spacek's performance as Straight's mentally challenged daughter Rose; although Spacek's performance seems overly mannered at first, she keeps revealing telling details about Rose until, at the end, her performance is as haunting as Farnsworth's own. \\"The Straight Story\\" may have the look and slightly off-kilter feel of a David Lynch movie, but at heart it resembles another recent Disney-released movie, \\"The Rookie,\\" which also is deeply concerned with the love of family and the need for second chances in life. Both movies are beautifully realized, but \\"The Straight Story\\" is an authentic American masterpiece.oncerned with the love of family and the need for second chances in life.

6305909326|1.0|It is very sad for a Christian to think that the best scene in a film is a sex scene. But that just so happened when I (the Christian in general) viewed this abomination. Thinking I'd see a film where the good guy fights Satan, I viewed this piece...that not only doesn't show the fight, but it appears that the main character (Johnny Depp) is going to have a friendly \\"chat\\" with Satan himself (That's what I got out of the last scene in the film). This film is boring, stupid, and makes \\"Vertigo\\" look like an actioner (I thought \\"Vertigo\\" was a good film). So it is sad to think that I sat through this film just to be entertained at the end by a thirty-second sex scene...
B00005JKQZ|4.0|Oscar winner Ron Howard (He'll always be Opie Taylor and Ritchie Cunningham to me!) successfully navigates a film with subject matters (math, economics and mental illness) that could and probably did discourage people from seeing this gem. Their loss.<br />Think what you will about his personal conduct but Russell Crowe proves that he's a splendid actor in his role as John Nash. Crowe took what could have been an unlikable character and made you care for him. Jennifer Connoly was impressive in her role of Mrs. Nash although I wish the movie had examined her struggles with her husband in more detail. The real Alicia Nash and her sacrifices were given short shift in the film.<br />There was a lot of controversy about the factual accuracy of this movie and the detractors have valid points. However, movies have often veered away from the &quot;true&quot; story for dramatic purposes so if you want a more detailed (and frankly more fascinating account of the Nashes) read the book upon which this movie was based. In the meantime, if you can ignore the factual omissions, sit back and enjoy the storytelling in this film.
B0000894RZ|5.0|I totally agree with bl7861 from Albany-----(must be us New Yorkers who really love this type of music)! And I still do! I'm a 53yr. old woman, & when I listen to anything by this white soulful diva, all I want to do is get in my convertible & go for a long drive on the I90! If I'm standing, I'm dancing! It's just the way she makes me feel! This is a great CD,& I find that unlike a lot of other yesterday artists, you still want to purchase her stuff--------it's timeless, and makes you want to move!
B0000025ZF|3.0|If Roger Waters' first solo album after leaving Pink Floyd sounds a lot like the latter outfit's somber, \\"The Final Cut\\" (which is exactly what it was for Waters), don't be surprised; though the idea came to the former Floyd songwriter's head in 1978, this '84 set was recorded right after (if not during) the process of \\"The Final Cut,\\" using many of the same studios and the same Holophonic sound technique.<br />In what was almost a Pink Floyd album itself (the band considered recording this work but chose \\"The Wall\\" as their project instead), \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitch-Hiking\\" is a concept album (there's a big surprise) that only Roger Waters could hatch. Its brave originality is something not to be overlooked however; \\"Pros and Cons\\" follows one man's nightmare from the time at 4:30am when 'Apparently They Were Travelling Abroad' to his 'Moment of Clarity' at 5:11am. The main character goes through many ups and downs in his dream, such as the threats of 'Arabs With Knives and West German Skies,' the concept proving Waters' idea is original, but often becomes tongue-in-cheek as the boring sexual theme with a female hitch-hiker drags on until \\"4:50am (Go Fishing),\\" and at times Waters is addressing things that seem to have nothing to do with the concept. There are also many awkward moments and voids filled with tiring lyrical stretches and weak instrumentation, such as 'Every Stranger's Eyes' and the closing 'Moment of Clarity.' Although, Eric Clapton's presence is unminstakable (if not slightly wasted) throughout the entire experience. The album's highlights are found in the more alarming moments, especially during the title track.<br />All in all, this album is a brick in the wall of Roger Waters, bearing many promising moments, but when things calm down, the album drags, especially when Waters resorts to a particular melody that is used several times throughout the album (like in the opening track and 'Dunroamin Duncarin Dunlivin'). Of course, Waters also manages to sneak in some social statements, although fortunately they're not as obvious as those on later works, all laden with many ear-grabbing (if not often unnecessary) sound effects.sneak in some social statements, although fortunately they're not as obvious as those on later works, all laden with many ear-grabbing (if not often unnecessary) sound effects.
B00007BK2N|5.0|Having been young enough at the time to see the Sex Pistols on a Tony Wilson show that included Marc Bolan and AC/DC I realised that here was someone, outside of London, knew that things were changing. Having been someone who for years bought anything that had a Factory tag attached to it, this film wrenched a lot of memories of following Joy Division, New Order, A Certain Ratio et al around the country and of all the 'good times' that could be had (oh how I wish someone knew how to tune the keyboard in the early JD days for instance). All in all didn't appreciate Happy Mondays cos they acted like tossers - more fool me eh? This is a film about Tony Wilson which he fully deserves. It is a great film. He was wrong about the Smiths but absolutely spot on with Mick Hucknall. By the way I thought God looked like me.
B000003S09|5.0|As a former skeptic of the &quot;prog rock&quot; label, I can honestly say that this was the King Crimson album--along with &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Discipline&quot;--that turned me into a believer in the power of progressive rock.<br />Rounding out one of the first of King Crimson's staggering list of line-ups over the years are founder and guitarist Robert Fripp, lyricist Peter Sinfield, percussionist Michael Giles, blooming bassist Greg Lake, and Ian McDonald, who entertains with a variety of instruments, including woodwinds and keyboards. Group these five men together and add their searing talent, and you get a powerful and alluring debut, 1969's &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King.&quot;<br />The album opens with the classic '21st Century Schizoid Man,' which packs a vivid punch that sounds like it could enter the heavy metal charts even in 2003. 'I Talk To the Wind' is an interesting ballad, matched with the whimsical 'Moonchild.' Neither of these &quot;gentler&quot; tracks ever become dull or drawn out. Separating these two however is the album's centerpiece, 'Epitaph,' with its musical strength and Sinfield's brilliantly poetic and somber lyrics. The closing track, the epic 'The Court of the Crimson King' closes a fantastic album perfectly, its operatic tones reaching heights never before seen in 1969.<br />The booklet of this remastered special edition comes with loads of rare photos and newspaper and magazine clippings about the band. Here in its 30th anniversary glory, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; proved that King Crimson was not a band to be overlooked or underestimated.
B000083C49|5.0|Of all Star Trek movies, \\"The Wrath of Khan\\", must be the most successful of them all, forgetting perhaps that this movie has an open ending, leading to \\"The Search for Spock\\" and ending the epic tale with the third act, which is the present one, \\"The Voyage Home\\".<br />You simply cannot extrapolate the one from the other, unless you want an incomplete story.<br />\\"The Voyage Home\\" is different from the two preceding ones, which were charged with drama and pathos. This is almost comedic in scope and shows the crew of the USS Enterprise (aboard a Klingon vessel), traveling back in time to San Francisco in 1986, in order to capture two humpback whales and therefore save the Federation from an imminent threat of annihilation by an alien probe.<br />How would you feel as a far advanced human being, living in the 23rd Century, if you had to face the social chaos of the mid-1980s?<br />This is how Cpt. Kirk, Spock, \\"Bones\\" and all the rest of the gang, landing on Earth, feel.<br />Like the preceding versions, including \\"The Motion Picture - Director's Cut\\", this too is crammed with tons of extras.<br />What I do not understand is, why these newer versions, which all come in a two-disc package cost less then the single disc versions.<br />If you want a sound advice and if you love the movie series, wait until Paramount dishes them all up in a Special Edition or Director's Cut version.<br />It's well worth it. You pay less. Receive more for the money, including a better picture and sound remix, and will always have your favorite characters at home with you, telling you why and how they decided to appear in the movie you are watching.<br />Paramount certainly hit the target.<br />I am anxious for the next installments, including \\"The Final Frontier\\", which actually didn't do so great at the box office.<br />Who knows, this time Shatner and company, may be able to release an extended version, or better, like in TMP, recut version that moves in a swifter way.<br />One never knows what will come next. I certainly hope, there is a different version of \\"Final Frontier\\". At the time of its release, there were rumors of a different version which never made it to the theaters, because of various factors (the kind of cutting and editing was mentioned and was among them, but also the decision by the studio to keep it short).<br />I don't know if this is true, but should it be, why not try to bring it to the surface and allow us to decide, which version is better?<br />Anyway, \\"The Voyage Home\\" is great fun for the entire family and is also the most \\"ecologically\\"-oriented one of them all.<br />I can only recommend it, but don't forget the other two preceding ones, they are an integral complement to this one...I certainly hope, there is a different version of \\"Final Frontier\\".

B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this album after hearing the song Bring Me To Life. I loved the song so I bought the album. I was surprised that all the songs were as good as that song. I listen to it a lot, but if you really want to listen to a good type rock cd. Buy this one!
B000002BBY|4.0|All the songs are catchy and on this album you are guaranteed pleasure from start to finish. Fist song is 'hello' which is simple pop/rock song, then comes roll with it which is kind of annoying and my least favourtie song on the album.<BR>Wonderwall and don't look back in anger are the two most famous oasis tunes in the uk and are with out a doubt the two best britpop songs. Hey now is a great song with a wonderful guitar towards the end and maybe my favourite song. Some might say is a powerful, fast and catchy song but then next comes the brilliant cast no shadow which could have been a #1 single if they released it this song is a masterpiece.<BR>She's electric is a simple pop song and morning glory is rocker which gives the album a great mix. Then champagne supernova is one of the best songs ever but too long, then again this song ends the album nicely.<BR>This album is worth buying it is what music is missing today.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I saw this movie...and I loved it. Renee Zelleweger did a great job as well as Catherine- Zeta Jones. The songs performed and dances are catchy. The outfits rock and the background and imagry are just awesome. I know for sure this is one dvd to own. It's no disappointment. There's like so many songs performed it's great. You never get bored and they are used with situations that have happened in the movie and show great deal of motion. Check it out. You won't be disappointed!
B000000WA2|3.0|This album is a mixture of britpop with songs like charmless man and country house but some of the album seems to be exploring other types of music with songs like yuko & hiro. About 10-11 songs are complete rubbish, the only good songs are sterotypes, charmless man, country house and the universal. This album certainly seeing blur making a great escape from britpop.
B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen by Evanescence is probably one of the best CD's i've heard in a long time. The vocals are beautiful...it blows all of todays female \\"singers\\" out of the water. The lyrics are deep, darker than what you'd expect and not all vapid and \\"perky\\". I am a fan of Linkin Park and i'll have to say that the guitars are a lot like that but it doesn't bother me too much. <br />The songs are excellent. My favorites are Tourniquet, Hello and Bring Me to Life, although all the songs are awesome. I've been having trouble finding a band that I like with all this [stuff] on the radio (Avril Laving, Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton...you get the picture)But now i've found a CD i can listen to anytime and any place. Amy Lee has the best voice i've heard and i really admire people that SING and not squeal. <br />All in all I highly recommend this CD by this talented group.
B00005JM93|4.0|Movies like this don't come around too often. Yes, this is an extremely violent film. Yes, there is a rape scene that seems like it was really happening, and is VERY hard to watch. Was it worth paying $9 to see? My answer: Not that I am into sadistic violence or cruelty, but I saw it twice.<br />The way this story is told in reverse order from ugliness to serenity is what entices me the most about this film. Noe is really communicating something here that I feel everyone should see, as shocking and intense as it is.<br />The camera work here is fantastic, the acting equally fantastic. I applaud Gaspar Noe for having the courage to produce a film this bold and moving. I won't see a film this engaging for quite some time. It only played at the local Landmark theatre for two short weeks. Bring on the DVD. I want many of my friends to experience this humanistic vision. It is a ride well worth it.
B000002UAX|5.0|This album has to be one of the best made albums, even when the two major songwriters of the band shared separate interests (you can tell also by Lennon or McCartney harmonizing themselves).  From &quot;Julia&quot; like soft singing with a floating melody, to &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; one of the hardest sounding songs of the time and hard for today also.  Also, the arrangements on the album such as &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot;.  These songs tell you what good songwriting is all about.  A must have for any Beatle fan.
014028009X|5.0|I loved this book, it's charming and I've recommended it to many of my friends.  I'll admit I was got a little tripped up with the English slang, but it made the book that much more endearing.<br />It's such a sweet book.  It's a breeze to read and a ton of chuckles.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Rarely have I made a purchase that I have so enjoyed. This album has such emotion and is an artistic work of genius. Thank you Johnny, for continuing to make such wonderful music. God Bless!
B00004Z459|5.0|I  had no idea who linkin park were when I got it, but when I heard the cd, it was like something I never heard of before. I used to like limp bizkit but somehow I couldn't get this cd out of my cd player and instantly linkin park became my favorite band. Chester has this amazing voice throught the cd that he show. He can sing really really low or really really high.When Chester and Mike sing at the same time, it's unbelievable!I love every single song on the cd but if I had to say which song was my favorite, I would say \\"Crawling\\".It is a great rock song.If nobody liked linkin park, they wouldn't have sold over 6 million copies. That means 6 million people like linkin park and you should too because they are the best rock band at the time.Get this CD!
B000066NW0|2.0|Making music doesn't have to be so complicated I guess.  Avril gets by it seems on high pitched yelling and public image alone.  However, when you strip away the tough girl attitude, all you are left with is lukewarm sludge.<br />The only redeeming track on this album is \\"I'm with you\\" in which Avril actually makes a half hearted attempt at actually singing.  Certianly not worth the purchase of the entire album.
B00008BLB8|5.0|This CD defines a wonderful time when music was evolving faster than groups could deliver what the record companies wanted us to hear.<br />But, you see, GFR didnt cut what someone else wanted us to hear. They began in a garage in Flint Michigan and I was lucky enough to set in a parking lot, across a busy highway and listen to them practice.  And while their music left the garage, their hearts didnt.  This is the real thing, the real Live rock and roll with FEELING.<br />HeartBreaker, Black Licorice and &quot;The Railroad&quot; shine on this CD, making it worth the price that you will pay. (Find it in a used CD store, I did:)<br />Come on, Ride the Railroad one more time.
B000002I2I|5.0|Morrison Hotel, in a way, was a return-to-form for the Doors, ending the experimentation that did them both good and bad on their previous 2 albums (Waiting for the Sun, and the Soft Parade), but yet it was a new album for the group as well. <BR>This was released in the midst of the Miami trial and many people began to doubt the Doors because many claimed that they 'sold out' on their last album, conservatives hated their guts because of Jim's lewd behavior, and the band seemed to be self-destructing. They managed to get rid of their pretenses and avoided their problems with Morrison Hotel. Instead of psychedelic experimentation and hit singles, you got a crunchy blues-influenced record that echoed their blues influences better than they did on their debut, and Morrison's poetry was more to the point, laying off the abstract and cosmic images that made up his poetry in the early days of the band, save Peace Frog and Waiting for the Sun. Despite tensions, the band seemed to be playing together really well on this album, with Robby Krieger's viciously underrated guitar lines, Ray Manzarek's organ, John Densmore's jazzy percussion and Morrison's coarse vocals as strong as ever. Second to their debut as their best album, Morrison Hotel is a keeper and a 'comeback' for a band on the verge of exile/being banned/destruction
B00003CXI1|3.0|One day, I was home sick and I was perusing my bookshelf for something to read when I ran across this book.  As a side note, the book made it to our shelf because a friend is a teacher and was reading it to her sixth grade class.  The book was a very fast read and was good enough to make you imagine the characters as being very real.  <br />The movie did a great job portraying the book and followed the plot almost to the letter.  The characters were quite real but the effects were just blah.  The movie could use a little spicing up.
B00008H2LB|5.0|No words can describe this amazing work of art....<BR><BR>Do yourself a favor and go get this cd! Now!
078401213X|1.0|The movie is not worth the hype it's gotten from some of the so-called literary critics.  This black and white low budget offering is too dark for most and incomprehensible to all but the most sadistic of &quot;intellectual&quot; types.  Do your self a favor - flunk this math test.
B000002IG4|5.0|Phil Collins 1982 opus Hello I Must Be Going was a dynamite follow-up to his successful solo debut Face Value from the previous year. This album in a way continues some of the elements of that album but in this case is an improvement over that one and some of the songs are many years ahead of their time thanks in part to innovative for the time recording techniques and this album as a whole still sounds fresh and new to this day even after almost 21 years after its release. I must say that this album has aged much better than No Jacket Required in a way. Those who loved In The Air Tonight will definitely cherish this album as it has similar songs like the dark and ominous I Dont Care Anymore and Do You Know, Do You Care?. Do You Know Do You Care gets my nod as the angriest and most raging song that Collins has ever composed and I would say that its even angrier, more intense, and even better than In The Air Tonight especially with the menacing keyboards and the extremely explosive ending where the song echoes away into the night. Phil Collins sounds awesome when hes angry and Pyssed off.<br />I have to say that the best songs on this CD are tied between Do You Know Do You Care, Thru These Walls, and The West Side. I Cannot Believe Its True, It Dont Matter To Me, Dont Let Him Steal Your Heart Away are your typical but classic sentimental Collins classics. Overall though, ALL of these 10 songs are greatALL OF THEM!<br /> I Dont Care Anymore continues the dark and angry backlash theme of In The Air Tonight with similar betas and dark atmosphere. I Cannot Believe Its True is a much brighter and funkier song and is more upbeat than the previous but more upbeat and not as ominous. Like China is a great and danceable rocker with great and memorable hooks and rocking guitars. Do You Know, Do You Care is by far the angriest and most turbulent song that Phil has ever composed. The things that make it so angry and so great to listen to are the combination of dark ambient sound, angry lyrics and Phil hitting the highest notes that he has ever managed to hit. This song alone makes this an essential CD.  The echoing rock guitars at the ending are unforgettable. If Collins was a ticking timebomb when he did In The Air Tonight, DYKDYC is the song where the timebomb (Collins) explodes. The main hit off this album was a cover version of the 60s classic You Cant Hurry Love and I must say, this is a great song to dance to and is a great ode to Motown. This song has a very strong 60s feel to it and is a great cover of the original. This song probably earned Collins the Nice Guy title. I Doesnt Matter To Me is a much happier song with lots of Phoenix Horns and great rhythm and vocals. Thru These Walls is a haunting mid-tempo song with a dark and mysterious mood. I think of this as a pre-cursor to One More Night and Do You Remember. TTW is a tale of a guy hearing his wife or girlfriend making love with another lover from another room, through the walls. Dont Let Him Steal Your Heart Away is typical but great and unforgettable Collins mid-tempo balladry. The West Side is the most intriguing song on this entire CD. It starts with a great mix of cymbals and thundering drums before blasting into an awesome instrumental with a marvelous blend of jazz, pop, and rock before reaching the climax with Phil singing Yeah!!!Yeah!!!Yeah!!! towards the ending. There are lots of Phenix Horns that are heard on a lot of Earth Wind & Fires music and the brass instruments in this instrumental song make it so much more compelling to listen to. I love this song much more than his other instrumentals even though they are good too. The album wraps up with Why Cant It Wait til Morning as an orchestral ballad and one of Phils best of his pre-1985 ballads. There is a gorgeous cover version done by jazz group Fourplay that features him that is available on their Best Of Fourplay CD. Its absolutely amazing and improves this song.<br />This album is a definite must for all the PC-Heads out there in the world. Phil Collins is one of the few artists out there who hasnt lost one bit of magic over the years and has maintained all of it the whole time even with Testify. In a way, I think that this album has aged better than most of No Jacket Required mainly because of the more live sounding instruments and REAL drums as opposed to the tons of drum machines used on the follow-up album three years later. Perhaps we should bring this style of sound back into our stereos again to combat the sick state of music again dont you think?<br />Anyway, HIMBG is a definite essential for all PC fans and is one of the best albums of 1982! I would even go far as to say that I enjoy this album more than lets say Thriller but not as much as Peter Gabriels Security. Go and get this CD NOW!!!985 ballads.

B00008H2LE|4.0|First, let me tell you whats bad about this album.<BR>1. It is 37 minutes long<BR>2. Some songs (Breaking the Habit) are nothing like what LP normally does...that song is way too soft<br />Now the good stuff.<BR>While you might have to listen to them a few times before u really like them, the whole CD aside from Breaking the Habit is very strong and is what you expect from Linkin Park.<BR>The best on the album are Hit the Floor, Figure 9, From the Inside, and Numb.<br />oh and if you're wondering if there are Christian bands like LP, give 38th Parallel and Pillar a listen.
B00006RAKP|5.0|If you are a true Elton John fan this collection is not be a missed one,it includes the greatest of the all the hits of EJ starting from his golden time in his great soul soothing voice the best track in this album is :-Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me(duet with George Michael),above all this is a great album worth it's price .
B00006CJOY|4.0|Some of the negative reviews that I've read here about this title seem to be a result of the fact that on many of these tracks, Manu Chao strays quite a bit from the original arrangements as originally presented in their studio counterparts.  While some of the songs on &quot;Radio Bemba&quot; are missing some of the texture that made them so wonderful in their initial incarnations (&quot;Bongo Bong&quot; for example), over all the re-workings of many of the songs make for a refreshing listen, especially if you have already spun your beloved &quot;Clandestino&quot; CD over a thousand times.  While not necessarily a substitute for the original studio versions, many of these songs benefit from the energy infused into them in the live versions, and I think that it proves to be a satisfying listen for the Manu Chao afficianado (especially if one doesn't go in expecting a regurgitation of the studio versions).  I was hesitant to pick this up after reading some of the negative reviews, but I am glad that I picked it up.
0767811070|5.0|Boyz'N the hood is a very memorable movie, remember watching it when it first came out, recently I decided to add it to my DVD collection. Actors Cuban Gooding J.R. (Trey), Lawerence Fishburne (Furious), Ice Cube (Dough Boy), Nia Long, Morris Chestnut (Ricky) deliver a very moving and powerful movie. John Singleton gets directing credit for this amazing movie. As some have already said this is not a gangster movie, this is a movie about growing up poor in South Central LA, and the survival needed to make it, its also about the relation between a father and his son (Trey &amp; Furious), and about two of Trey's friends who have no father, brothers Ricky and Doughboy- one the rising football star, the other the local hood. To there mother, one can do no wrong, and the other is always in the wrong. Movie has some really positive moments, one of my favourites is when Trey and his pops are riding in the car, and listening to Five Stairsteps &quot;Ooh Child&quot; a classic soul song. Another thing that makes characters stand out is watching them develop from boys to men. Tragedy strikes in the movie, and Trey goes to look for revenge, then stops himself coming to realization that thats not the choice he wants to make in life. &quot;Boyz 'N the Hood&quot; is a good movie, that will keep you captivated from start to finish.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I agree with many when I say you have to listen to it a couple of times to get it!  I think they did a great job.  They were able to come up with all the songs on this album in a year and a half.  Also they had to live up to Hybrid Theory which in my opinion is one of the best rock albums.  This is a band that can actually incorporate different styles of music in to one and make it sound really good.  Excellent job on the cd and I recommmend it to everyone.  This band is going somewhere.
B00005JKZT|4.0|second story of lord of the rings. its real intersting story about good and evil. its about medievl times. like harry potter.
B000067IZ3|5.0|For a very long time after this movie was released I complained about not wanting to see it because of it sounding dull. Than Oscar time rolls around and Steven Sohdeberg and Benecio Del Torro both take home awards for it. Still I wasn't convinced that I \\"needed\\" to see it.<br />Recently the movie came on Showtime and I decided, Hell, might as well watch it. God am I glad that I did. Traffic is easily being put in my Top 10 movies list. The directing, cinemotography, acting, and story had me sucked in for the full 2.5 hours of the movie. It is just amazing. The ending sequences left me staring blankly at my TV set in awe that someone in Hollywood actually figured out how to end a movie with a bang. This is easily a 5 star movie and should be watched by all.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard Evanescence's song, \\"My Immortal\\", I was captivated by Amy Lee's angelic voice on the song.  However, I proceeded with caution, because she could have been in the same genre as Sarah McLaughlan.  When I bought \\"Fallen\\", my fears were put down.  This album makes good use of Amy's impressive vocals, the guitar work and drum programming is superb, and the use of the synth is better than any group since Pink Floyd.  Plus it manages to soothe souls, leave the listener depressed, and kick butt all at once-a rare feat for any album. The only problem with \\"Fallen\\" is it's so damn good that many an airhead teeny-bopper who buys anything that's popular (but will never figure out the asthetics of this album) will also buy it.  But that's just a small price to pay for a band that's definitely going to go places.
0385486804|4.0|I liked this book a lot, though it really is different from most books you'll read.  As a non-fiction work, this book follows the life of Christopher McCandless through interviews with friends, family, and acquaintances.  I can relate to this individual on multiple levels as he went to high school just down the road from me.  He ran cross country in high school, as I did.  He died in Alaska and I was born and raised there.  Krakauer does a very good job of bringing to life someone that we actually know relatively little about.  Chris's story is sad and yet poignant at the same time.  It's hard not to respect not only his intellectualism, but his drive to understand the truth in life.  While this ultimately cost him his life and is in retrospect the result of decisions few of us would ever make, it does strike a cord with me.  This is one of the few stories that I actually find myself reflecting back on long after I finished reading the book.
0066620996|5.0|This is a wonderful piece of research and a very well-written book.  The scientific foundation is robust, findings are thought-provoking and at times shocking, reading is easy, and evidence for arguments plentiful.  What a joy to read a book like this.  Congratulations to the author and the research team and many thanks.
B000002U8G|5.0|Words can not describe how excellent this album is. From the beginning instumental, with the mesmerizing and creative sounds, to the final song with the greatest lyrics ever, you will not be able to put this album down. This album is Pink Floyd's unsung album, being their most innovative and psychedellic. If you enjoyed the albums Dark Side of the Moon, In the Court of the Crimson King, or Close to the Edge, you will definitely enjoy this album. My favorite song on this album happens to be Fearless, which is uplifting and never dull. I urge you to get this album!!!
B00005JLSE|5.0|Bob Fosse's sexy cynicism still shines in Chicago, a faithful movie adaptation of the choreographer-director's 1975 Broadway musical. Of course the story, all about merry murderesses and tabloid fame, is set in the Roaring '20s, but Chicago reeks of '70s disenchantment--this isn't just Fosse's material, it's his attitude, too. That's probably why the movie's breathless observations on fleeting fame and fickle public taste already seem dated. However, Rene Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are beautifully matched as Jazz Age vixens, and Richard Gere gleefully sheds his customary cool to belt out a showstopper. (Yes, they all do their own singing and dancing.) Whatever qualms musical purists may have about director Rob Marshall's cut-cut-cut style, the film's sheer exuberance is intoxicating. Given the scarcity of big-screen musicals in the last 25 years, that's a cause for singing, dancing, cheering. And like Mr. Billy Flint says...That's Chicago! Even though I am a live theatre fan and have seen the show on stage, I thought the movie was amazing. Of course the vocals and choreography were fabulous, but what I especially liked was the lighting and special effects. Most stage plays don't make it on the big screen, but Chicago did it all! Kudos to everyone in the cast and crew!
B00005AQE8|5.0|Best ever bar-none.  ...  You don't know.  Music is an art whether it is rock or whatever it should be respected if comes true from the heart.  For sure everything came from the heart and soul with 2Pac.  Respect the dead and respect the man's music.  Go cop this cd if you still haven't or if you are just a teenie-booper trying to make a collection.  You will be satisfied and gracious and hear the greatest MC of the westcoast.  For respect biggie is the greatest MC of the eastcoast.  Its too bad they could never get along and collobrate.  One could only imagine..anyways this is a great cd but his best cd is me against the world.
0380789035|3.0|It is almost April 1st.  I've been chipping away at this book since December.  I just cannot get the desire to read it.  Parts are well written, and the book grabbed me in the first pages, but it isn't making any sense to me.  I'm passed the halfway point so I'm determined to hack through to the end to see what this is about but there are some very lengthy secions of \\"historical\\" information that come from nowhere and go nowhere.  I can only assume that they'll come together in the end but they are very very boring to read and so far this has not been worth my time.
B00005JKMQ|4.0|Muhammad Ali is surely one great character and his life undoubtedly renders a great movie script. When I found out \\"Ali\\" was going to be made, I was eager to see it from the first moment. After watching it yesterday, I was a little disappointed.<br />First of all, \\"Ali\\" covers only ten years of Muhammad's life. Sure, those were the \\"best\\" ten years in Ali's life, when he was at the top of his boxing career, when he converted to muslim religion, when he was a friend of Malcolm X's. But certainly, Ali's life is much more than that. Even if the movie is longer than 150 minutes, I was, at the end, feeling that there was something missing (and there really was). Another low point of the movie is Michael Mann's direction. After \\"Heat\\" and \\"The insider\\" (two movies I really enjoyed), he changed his style, and Ali's was a blend of Steven Soderbergh and Oliver Stone. Maybe Mann wanted his movie to be like a documentary, but that was not the point in \\"Ali\\" (there is already a tremendous documentary about Ali, called \\"When we were kings\\").<br />Now, the good parts: the producers worked hard and found actors that really resemble the fighters, specially George Foreman. Will Smith does not resemble Ali, but Smith does a competent job as the protagonist. Aside from his good acting, his leg and feet movements are impressibly close to what Ali did in the ring. I also have to mention Mario van Peebles as Malcolm X, Mykelti Williamson as Don King (funny) and John Voight as sports-anchor Howard Cosell. But the main award should go to Jamie Foxx as Ali's drug-addicted, priest-like jew companion Bundini Brown. Great performance.<br />Anyway, Ali was not what I expected. But it's an interesting movie about one of the greatest boxers, personalities and characters of the XX century.<br />Grade 8.0/10
B00005JLSE|5.0|Bob Fosse's sexy cynicism still shines in Chicago, a faithful movie adaptation of the choreographer-director's 1975 Broadway musical. Of course the story, all about merry murderesses and tabloid fame, is set in the Roaring '20s, but Chicago reeks of '70s disenchantment--this isn't just Fosse's material, it's his attitude, too. That's probably why the movie's breathless observations on fleeting fame and fickle public taste already seem dated. However, Rene Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are beautifully matched as Jazz Age vixens, and Richard Gere gleefully sheds his customary cool to belt out a showstopper. (Yes, they all do their own singing and dancing.) Whatever qualms musical purists may have about director Rob Marshall's cut-cut-cut style, the film's sheer exuberance is intoxicating. Given the scarcity of big-screen musicals in the last 25 years, that's a cause for singing, dancing, cheering. And like Mr. Billy Flint says...That's Chicago! Even though I am a live theatre fan and have seen the show on stage, I thought the movie was amazing. Of course the vocals and choreography were fabulous, but what I especially liked was the lighting and special effects. Most stage plays don't make it on the big screen, but Chicago did it all! Kudos to everyone in the cast and crew!
B000002HRE|5.0|Hi, i am a second generation metallica fan.  I know what i'm talking about.  I love this album as i do all metallica albums.  It is not as heavy as the past but still as good.  The lyrics are well written and the subject is well relateable.  It has infectious drum beats (im a drummer) and catchy melodies and rememorable lyrics.  I loved it. They did not sell out, people who say that are ignorant and are just saying what everyone else says,going along with the crowd.  Even if they did, not to buy a good album of the best band because the sell more albums is sad and hypocritical. Buy it.
B00005R2M3|3.0|I only liked one song on this cd and that was #3 Whenever, Wherever. A lot of the songs are in spanish and I didn't like the other songs that she sang in English. Just buy the single for Whenever, Wherever. I found an import at Amazon.com its ASIN is B00005V8Z1 so just copy and paste it on the search box and it'll bring up the single.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is definetely the cd that i've been waiting to come out for awhile. IT&quot;S AMAZING! having a female as the lead vocalist in a rock group brings a totally new sound to music...but I guess it's probably just amy lee's incredible voice! THIS CD DEFINETELY won't dissapoint.. YOU NEED TO BUY IT!! If you've heard bring me to life on the radio over and over again and are craving for more than this is the CD for you!
B00006AW2J|5.0|After well over 20 years of soiling their good name, it's hard to fathom that the Rolling Stones were once capable of something as simultaneously anthemic and (gasp) humble as \\"Beggar's Banquet\\". The album's two major hits (\\"Street Fighting Man\\" and \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\") may have devolved into cures for insomnia after three decades of overexposure on RAWK-radio, but those two songs always felt out of place anyway. The bulk of \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" masterfully corrupts acoustic country blues into the Stones formula. \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" may be the standout moment: seething with lyric and sonic malevolence, pierced by screeching feedback, it's almost the antithesis of the gentlemanly \\"Salt of the Earth\\". Throughout the album the Stones seem intent on reexamining their deepest roots, like they'd cast aside their simple pop ambitions for something more. The miracle is that they found it. \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" led to the stunning triumverate of \\"Sticky Fingers\\", \\"Let It Bleed\\", and \\"Exile On Main Street\\". It's a quartet of albums where rock & roll - as dirty, crude, and simple as it was - stormed the sanctity of art.
6304259093|2.0|I am a fan of the first installment of the Crow Trilogy, so I felt, why not go out and rent the second one.  Everybody always says that sequals will never be as good as the originals. In this movies case, I believe they should have stuck with only the first one.  The plot was alright, but the acting and casting, downright unworthy of the release rack.  After seeing this move I made a promise never to watch another sequal.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Arguably, one of the greatest films ever made.  Steven Spielberg may have been right when he said that the scene of Omar Sharif riding in from the horizon, wth a mirage to his right was the greatest scene ever filmed.<br />In addition to being great entertainment, Lawrence of Arabia is  a reasonably accurate (by Hollywood standards) recounting of history.  Based on T.E. Lawrence's \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\\" (the unabridged version is 850 pages), watching this movie gives you a sense and understanding of history that is rarely found in a non-documentary film.<br />The film took 285 days of on-location shooting.  In today's dollars, it could be a $200 milion plus film.<br />Though this film was made 40 years ago, it only shows its age in one way.  Unlike most of today's movies which ask little work on the part of the viewer, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is most appreciated when the viewer puts some effort into the movie: you should follow the nuances of the dialogue very carefully, and most important, consult a map of the Mid-East periodically. With each viewing, you will expand your perspective of the movie.  In that sense, I liken \\"Lawrence\\" to the Godfather trilogy - each time you watch the movie, you appreciate the craftsmanship of the movie even more.<br />  <br />The DVD has helpful extra features including a DVD-ROM collection of maps.<br />Enjoy !
B00007J5VN|4.0|I was eagarly awaiting this DVD. Univeral has presented the roadshow version of SWEET CHARITY on this DVD. Included is the Overture and Intermission music. However, Universal neglected or purposely omitted the Exit music following the end credits, The Exit music was included on a previous laser release. This was a big disappointment, otherwise a good DVD presentation.
B00000JGEN|4.0|Obviously not one of the best or maybe even one of Arnold's best, but I have enjoyed watching all or parts of it several times and I don't get tired of it.  Isn't that what you want in a film you are going to shell out bucks to have your own copy of?
B00008H2LB|5.0|i am the number one linkin park fan and i just gotta say they do it again.  i'm tired of everybody saying...\\"oh the songs are too short\\" or...\\"all chester does is yell.\\"  well i gotta say this they get to the point!!!  that's what makes them the best band.  they just say what they feel inside and make it short and sweet.  not like all the other rappers and other bands who take 4 to 5 minutes to add who they hate or having to say cuss words. b/c all the songs that last from the four to five minutes tend to just blah blah through it and say the samething over and over again...what's good about that!  NOTHING AGAINST EMINEM THOUGH.  i have much love for him.  but the main reason i love this band is because they take a lot into one.  they can make a rave, a rock concert, and hip-hop format together.  THAT'S INCREDIBLE TALENT.  and no cussing...gotta love that!!!  IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CD...GET IT!!!!!!
B000068PQ0|4.0|This is an excellent album: lush, orchestral, complex and euphoric all at once. The atmosphere this music creates, and especially the lyrics, give the whole thing a glowing, child-like innocence. I Imagine this is what the book \\"The Little Prince\\" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry would sound like if converted into sound. Or a space-age \\"Pet Sounds\\".<br />It IS a beautiful album, as most folks have said here before me, but so far I don't find it as satisfying as the miraculous \\"The Soft Bulletin\\". Perhaps I just need a few more listens, I don't know...<br />There is just one thing that really does bug me though...the first song on the album (\\"Fight Test\\") is a note for note [copy] of \\"Father and Son\\" by Cat Stevens! Accidental, I'm sure...
B000062TU1|3.0|I have to admit that I haven't read any of the amazingly popular novel's from which this movie came. However, after viewing this film, I am certainly tempted to do so. While this film is certainly designed for the preadolescent market, it has those necessary hooks to keep even the most hardened realist of an adult interested. <br />Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a young wizard, who after his parents were killed, was left with his mean and un-magical, aunt, uncle and bratty cousin who force him to live under the stairs. However, on his 11th birthday he is accepted into the Hogwart's School for young witches and wizards and enters a world of magic and mystery. While at school, he and his classmates Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) set out on a quest to find the Sorcerer's Stone (which will bring immortality to those who possess it) and to prevent an evil wizard from acquiring it.<br />Outside of the main cast of children (who are excellent); this film is chocked full with an astounding cast of British actors. Robbie Coltrane (Henry V, GoldenEye) is perfect as the lumbering and loveable giant, Rubeus Hagrid. Alan Rickman (Bob Roberts, Dogma) once again proves that he can do sinister better than any living actor. English heavyweights Richard Harris (The Guns of Navarone, Unforgiven) and Maggie Smith (Tea with Mussolini, Gosford Park) give good performances. The short appearances by John Cleese (Life of Brian, A Fish Called Wanda) and John Hurt (I Claudius) round out this superb cast.<br />The cinematography is fun and inventive with a superb use of computer special effects. The setting is a combination of gothic horror and Dickensian melodrama, which works to good effect. The story combines fairy tales of every shape and kind. From Cinderella to Greek and Roman mythologies, this movie weaves a storyline that is fun to follow. The appearance of Cerberus, the three-headed dog, now renamed as Fluffy is especially amusing.<br />Now, despite all of these good things, the fact of the matter is that this is a fluff adventure. The characters are fairly cookie-cutter with very little time given to character development. The storyline is convoluted by its attempt to juggle too many plot lines. However, it is fun to watch and I'm glad I checked it out. I may have to borrow a child so I can go watch the next one in the theatres.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Overall, not a bad disc. However, I wasn't totally satsfied. First, as has been mentioned, this is a short CD. Second, it just didn't bring out the same emotions as the first CD, for the most part. One of the things I loved about Hybrid Theory was that I found something in every song that I loved, which is pretty rare, most CDs seem to have a good song or two to put on the radio, and a bunch of stuff just to fill up the cd. Unfortunately, Meteora drifts much more into the latter group - &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot; are the only songs I could really get into and expect to still be listening to in a week.<br />Overall, if you're new to LP, go for Hybrid Theory. However, if you're an LP fan, go ahead and get this one also, you're sure to find something you like; just don't expect the near-perfection of Hybrid Theory.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Every track on this CD is good. There is not ONE bad track to speak of, and that's a huge accomplishment by itself. This is the perfect complement to The Chronic. Both albums define the very nature of what G-Funk and rap are all about. It's produced by Dr. Dre, and his influence is seen in every track through incredibly irrestible beats (a la The Chronic). This CD has some of the best beats ever heard on a rap album, combined with incredible lyrics and Snoop's best style. Guest appearances from The Dogg Pound rappers are excellent, and this is by far Snoop's best rapping.<br />This CD CANNOT be compared to any other Snoop Dogg CD; it surpasses any of his other albums with ease.  There are so many classics on this album (\\"Gin and Juice,\\" \\"Murder Was the Case,\\" \\"Ain't No Fun,\\" \\"Tha Shiznit,\\" etc.) and the others, though less played, are equally as good. If you liked The Chronic (in other words, if you like real rap with incredible beats and lyrics) then buy this album. It will not disappoint. This goes along perfectly with The Chronic and many debate which album is better. Either way, you cannot lose with this album: It is easily one of the best rap albums EVER.
B00005JLK1|5.0|THIS is a good movie .IT has good specal effects and 3D fun.IT  is a little scary,but better than {thirteen GHOST}THE BEAGAING IS GOREY,but not bad.I wouldent let kids waltch it.

B00005NB8K|5.0|Val Kilmer gives a stunning performance. This movie is about how the rock group The Doors came to be. It is mostly told looking through the usually intoxicated and drugged up frontman, Jim Morrison's eyes. You are drawn into his confusing world and see his visions. The casting is incredible. I have never known much about The Doors, but after seeing clips of the real Morrison on the second disk, you realize how well casted Val Kilmer was. Kilmer even sang the songs in the movie. A story that director Oliver Stone tells is how Kilmer challenged him to listen to a recording of him as Jim Morrison and a few songs of Morrison himself and try to guess who was singing which songs. Stone could not tell the difference! The whole band was well cast. Cast interviews and deleted scences are found on the second disk. Oliver Stone did a fine job. I really don't know how else one could tell such a tale or get you to share the high quite like Stone. But Kilmer's work alone warranted a 5 star rating for this movie.
0375501851|4.0|&quot;White Teeth&quot;, author Zadie Smith's first novel, is the generation-spanning story of two men - one British, one Bengali - whose friendship, career, and families depict an ongoing struggle of race, gender, and religion.  Smith addresses global issues (the relationship of former colonies to their erstwhile rulers and of the working class to the middle class, religious fundamentalism, the tribulations of assimilation) as well as personal ones (marital relations, the complications of siblings, forgiveneness) with a voice that is intelligent and skeptical as well as sympathetic.<br />The book's flaws are minor: occasional slow patches in the 450-page narrative, a (perhaps intentional, but still inappropriate in a novel of this length and scope) superficial treatment of the endgame.  Its assets are recommend it to politicians, readers, and inhabitants of the world: it is an enjoyable read, and powerful in a deliberate, thoughtful way.  The writing, reminiscent of a less flamboyant, more deliberate Tom Robbins, is an excellent counterpoint to the seriousness of the narrative, rendering the characters' struggles entertaining without trivializing them.  The story, rich with its own history, intertwines modern issues with ancient ones, addressing the past and its inhabitants and our struggles to escape them.  Ultimately, it points out, we are victims of a fallacy of the English language: &quot;past tense, future perfect&quot;.
0694013889|1.0|I was a little shocked at the choice of words and descriptions. I couldn't get past the third page. I would definitely read/see this book in person before I purchased it. I threw mine out.
0440237688|5.0|I loved this book!  Even though I have never been one to read Science Fiction or Fantasy, I can't wait to share this book with students!  The 'open-ended' conclusion will make wonderful discussion questions.  We will all probably write our own endings.  Lois Lowry writes about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a 'perfect' society.  There are no decisions to be made, no hatred, no war, no memories and...no love.  When Jonas turns 12 he becomes the \\"Receiver\\" of all memories and feelings.  What an interesting story unfurls from there!  I would highly recommend this book for any mature young adult readers (and for us \\"oldies\\", too).
B0000025HG|5.0|Streisand made a winner here. Too bad no one noticed. The ballad KISS ME IN THE RAIN, is not on any Greatest Hits I know of and should be. It ranks with SONGBIRD as a song that should've been number one. The Late Paul Jabara (who died of AIDS Complications) wrote the hit on this CD &quot;No More Tears.&quot; Jabara who won an Oscar for &quot;Last Dance&quot; (he also wrote the Weather Girls --It's Raining Men&quot; notice the pattern they all are similar)Jabara coming off his success of &quot;Last Dance&quot; wrote &quot;The Main Event&quot; for Streisand. He then came up with the idea of having Disco's Number One pair with Streisand. Both ladies LOVED the idea. One problem Streisand's CD was a &quot;Theme&quot; of water. So Jabara simply added &quot;It's raining, it's pouring my love life is boring me to tears...&quot; Thus WATER. There are many versions of this song. Summer has 3 versions on 3 greatest hit CDs which are different from this one. This version clearly shows the power of each womens voices.The other standouts Niagra, and Ain't Gonna Cry...&quot; showcase her beautifully. And come on guys &quot;Splish splash -- is fun. OK it isn't Bobby Darrin but this WAS the DISCO era.&quot;I have NEVER seen this CD at a used CD shop, so evidently not a lot of people own it. Spring for the full price you will enjoy it.
1558908382|5.0|This is an endlessly fun movie with a great soundtrack (The Specials, The Clash, to name a few) and perfect-pitch dialogue.<BR>If I, like Cusack's character, were an assasin on my way back to a ten-year high school reunion, I'd hope to be as cool and witty and honest as him. This is a movie for former punk-kids with romantic tendencies. I will always recommend it.
B00005JKTE|1.0|What a bad movie ! I like Kate B but why is she playing in this...? First, she's selected as a spy to go to France because she's a french speaker and what a surprise to see that once in France, everybody speak english ! What a Joke ! ...I'm french and I didn't know that in France people were english speakers ;0/ I put the french language option through the DVD and it's not better...All the actors are english or american so it means that there is a french dubbing ...and this is very bad.Voices are ridiculous. Now about the story, there are so many incoherences in the story.It is in my oopinion the movie you need if you are tired after a long day.You will sleep quickly so much this stuff is long,boring..
B00008H2LB|4.0|Well I guess I can start by saying this cd is like everyone else is saying Hybrid Theory pt.2. But I guess I cant complain much it sounds like what I loved on Hybrid Theory(until it got stolen). The songs are more experimental and have more melody to them but no drastic change. Well,If u liked Hybrid Theory get this but dont expect to be blown away like u were when u got Hybrid Theory because it might feel a little like dejavue when u listen to it.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|This is a great C.D. It is hard enough to get into the american music industry from our own country, and these girls did it from Russia. I bought both C.D.'s and I don't know anything but english!...be proud...support the artists!
B00003CXXM|5.0|It's a great movie...There is not a boring seconde.Matt D and the other actors are very good, the FX are terrific and the story is 100% action but quite smart.Nothing negative.If you like suspense, it's the movie u need.
B00004Z459|5.0|Okay, this album was the best album I've ever heard in my entire life!... WTF, go out and buy it if you don't have it!...  YOU NEED IT!  Here is my summary of all the tracks on the CD.<BR>PAPERCUT- great start to the CD and an awesome sound to it.  The vocals rock.  5/5<BR>ONE STEP CLOSER- ... this song is soooo great!  i love the \\"SHUT UPS!\\"s near the end of this song.  5/5<BR>WITH YOU- A very good song.  The vocals rock.  some parts are cheesy, but overall, it's really good.  4.5/5<BR>POINTS OF AUTHORITY- One of my fav songs on the CD.  its sooo good with the best lyrics and tune.  I LOVE IT!!  5/5<BR>CRAWLING-  this song is awesome.  the screaming is great and i can't get enough of it.  The lyrics are deep and meaningful.  5/5<BR>RUNAWAY-  Not the best song on the CD, but still pretty good.  4/5<BR>BY MYSELF-  the screaming then the rapping thing going on is wicked cool!  It's gripping and awesome!  the lyrics are kind of depressing, but rock is not an optimistic genre.  5/5<BR>IN THE END-  A very good song, it's one of my favorites.  5/5<BR>PLACE FOR MY HEAD-  wow.  this song is too good to say anything else.  words cannot describe it.  its my favorite song on the CD.  11/5<BR>FORGOTTEN- awesome  5/5<BR>Cure For The Itch- a great tune with the best DJing I've ever heard.  Though it has no lyics, i love it and listen to it again and again and again and again...5/5<BR>PUSHING ME AWAY- Although kind of slow and not enough screaming, it's a great song.  It's my second favorite song on the CD.  I LOVE THIS ONE!...  5/5
B000068PQ0|4.0|I haven't listened to the Lips since their cd with \\"She Don't Use Jelly\\" on it.  So I decided to listen to this cd.  Track 3 was the first track I listened to.  That song is one of those songs that gets stuck in your head all day.<br />This album, to me, is classic Lips at their best.  Doesn't sound anything like Radiohead (which I personally dislike), or Coldplay (which im my view is the absolute worst group to come in to existence.
B00005670G|4.0|Very good.  If you like Little Caesar, Saints &amp; Sinners, and Sugartooth, this lesser-heard band will be good listening.
0684833395|5.0|This satirical novel tells the interconnected stories of Yossarian the bombadier and the men who serve in a military camp on an Italian island during WWII.  Nearly every character in this story is crazy, some because they have become unbalanced through their horrific battle experiences and others because they serve so well as functionaries in a system that has normalized the killing of other people.  Yossarian retains his  sanity through a tight focus on the necessity of his own survival.  He becomes a hero by ultimately refusing to capitulate to the forces that demand him to sublimate this most basic and healthy of natural urges to the convenience of a system of death based on the spurious logic of \\"Catch-22,\\" a series of mutually exclusive choices that make true choice impossible and lead one by default down the most destructive path.<br />This is a very funny book, although I felt that some of the more outlandish satire didn't sit well with the more graphically realistic elements of the novel.  The narrative is presented in a disjointed manner that heightens the chaos of the situation.  <BR>Some may be put off by the manner in which Heller attacks the mentality of war without any consideration for the specific conditions that may have provided some justification for the prosecution of WWII.
B00008H2LE|4.0|This cd is exactly what i expected from lyrical genuises Linkin Park. Once again they grab you with incredible songs that grab you and have you begging for more. Like hybrid theory, every song on the cd is great. The cd could have been longer but i just find myself listening to the entire cd over and over again. \\"Dont stay\\", \\"Lying from you\\",and \\"From the inside\\" are easily the standout tracks but the entire cd will have you singing out loud enjoying every minute of this great band. Good job guys keep it up with the next album. I have already reserved it.
B00008H2LB|3.0|When I bought &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; in 2001, it quickly became one of my favorite albums, in fact there isn't a song on that disc that I don't like....so naturally, I was looking forward to LP's new record &quot;Meteora&quot;. After recieving it in the mail today, I quickly shoved it in my player and gave it a listen....and I must say I have no plans to listen to it again anytime soon. I didn't enjoy a single track on the disc, and I find it difficult to believe this is a brand new record and not a collection of outtakes from Hybrid Theory. To me, it sounds like the same old songs regurgitated with different vocals, more heavy guitars, and more screaming....and nowhere near as good. I think it pales greatly in comparison to Hybrid Theory in every area. The highlight of the record is probably the last song, &quot;Numb&quot;. Unfortunately, it sounds almost exactly like &quot;Crawling&quot; from Hybrid Theory....the same chord progressions and everything. All in all, I found Meteora to be a complete disappointment. I'm not going to say &quot;don't buy it&quot;, because I realize everyone is different and I'm sure there are lots of people who think it's great. If you're such a hardcore LP fan that you would buy an album of nursery rhymes if Linkin Park was doing them, then by all means go out and pick this up. For the rest, my advice is to download the songs from a file-sharing program first so you can preview them before making the decision of whether or not to spend your hard-earned money on them. I didn't do this, and it's a mistake I won't make again. I gave the cd three stars because the members of Linkin Park still have more musical talent in their pinkies than I'll ever have in my entire body, and they deserve credit for their effort. However, if my review was based solely on originality, creativity and ability to live up to the standard set by &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, I'd have given it one star.
B00005Q66N|5.0|I first heard the Scorps &quot;Fly to the Rainbow,&quot; and I knew they were going to be big. To me, the Scorpions (and the great Schenker brothers) have transcended German Rock and have conquered the world. Therein lies the superb BLACKOUT album. <br />I thought the song was written about me and I took 'Blackout' as my new world anthem. I deliberately poured Johnny Walker Black on the scratchy, played-out album (when I bought the CD) as a tribute to many great memories that seemed to always have Scorpions playing in the background of my life (e.g. when I woke-up from an alcoholic blackout in Frankfurt).<br />The Scorpions will ALWAYS be a force to reckon with; BLACKOUT being one of many great Scorpion albums, but absolutely one of their best!
B00004Z400|4.0|This is the Deftones most impressive release to date. They've broadened out and seem to have found their style. They've added in touches of Ambient (Digital Bath) and seem to have a bit of Pink Floyd influence (Knife Party resembles The Great Gig in the Sky) but still retained their heaviness (Street Carp) and Chino even shows off his rapping (Back to School). Chino is one the best singers out their nowadays, and its evident on tracks such as Knife Party, Teenager and Street Carp. This cd is brilliant and is a standout in the genre. Every member is at top notch on this cd and it shows. This is the next evolution in the Deftones career. They've still retained their sound from Around the Fur but updated it. The guest appearance from Maynard of Tool is also incredible, making Passenger one of the best tracks. The Deftones have started to expand their sound and I can only anticipate their next release. I can only give it a 4 because of the track Back to School, not one of my favourites. The bonus track Boys Republic is a great addition too.
B000001E7L|5.0|Following up a remarkable debut album can pose quite a problem for a musical artist or group, but the Cranberries shrugged off any hint of a sophomore slump and really outdid themselves with this album.  It doesn't have quite the appeal and ethereal magic of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, but the complexity and maturity of No Need To Argue is really quite remarkable.  Rather than trying to repackage the appeal of their first effort, the Cranberries greatly extended their musical tendrils into the solid ground of serious, socially conscious, heart-stirring lyrics.  This album doesn't have the instantaneous listenability of what came before, but that is largely due to the fact that this album is a much more personal, revealing statement on the part of singer and songwriter Dolores O'Riordan.  We see a richer, somewhat darker side of the Cranberries in these thirteen songs.  Leading the charge is Zombie.  I for one love this song; some might say its atypically heavy, rocking delivery doesn't fit the Cranberries' style or O'Riordan's voice, but I say the song merely goes to show the versatility of the band.  This was not the type of music expected from this group at the time, and that makes it an eye-opening triumph in my opinion.  Ridiculous Thoughts contains traces of the same hard-driving presentation of Zombie, but really and truly this album is one of plaintiff, melancholy songs.  There is a touching sadness to tracks such as Ode To My Family, 21, Empty, Daffodil Lament, and Disappointment.  Dreaming My Dreams is a quiet love song O'Riordan wrote and dedicated to her husband.  Yeat's Grave is a somber and respectful tribute to poet W.B. Yeats, while the title track is funereal in its presentation.  Raw emotion does appear in a couple of songs: the specter of child abuse puts O'Riordan's voice on edge in The Icicle Melts, while lonely frustration fuels the passion of I Can't Be With You.<br />This album put to rest any suggestions that the Cranberries' music lacked substance.  No Need to Argue comes across as a deeply personal album that, if anything, is slightly too introspective and serious.  This being the case, it takes several listens before the beauty and incredible, emotional intensity of this album really comes across completely.  If you only listen to the album a couple of times, you might well dismiss it as a somewhat disappointing followup to the much more accessible music of the group's first album.  In time, though, the depth and beauty of this album manifests itself, grabbing you with its incredible intensity.  In its own way, No Need to Argue is even more remarkable than Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?  With their debut album, The Cranberries soared into the sky; with No Need To Argue, they proved they could fly.es' music lacked substance.  No Need to Argue comes across as a deeply personal album that, if anything, is slightly too introspective and serious.  This being the case, it takes several listens before the beauty and incredible, emotional intensity of this album really comes across completely.  If you only listen to the album a couple of times, you might well dismiss it as a somewhat disappointing followup to the much more accessible music of the group's first album.

B00005JLSE|5.0|I loved the movie and the cd was just as good. I had thought that it was just going to be an average boring musical, but my friend insisted that i should go see it. I loved it and i cannot wait until it comes out on DVD/VHS.
B0000844IT|4.0|I think &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; takes the cake for having been re-released on DVD so many times. I believe that this is the 4th edition, and is so far the best. Why they couldn't have released this edition in the first place, I'll never know, but it would have definitely save me some pocket change.<br />The &quot;Boomstick&quot; edition is more or less a compiling of both versions of the film, the US Theatrical Version and the Director's Edition. Here are the differences:<br />Theatrical Version: This is the one I prefer, because it is more of a comedy that a horror movie. It is the version everybody saw first, and it has all the classic moments from the VHS and initial DVD release.<br />Director's Version: This is the same as the &quot;Official Bootleg Cut&quot; that came out last year. It boasts 15 minutes of never-before-seen footage, but it comes at the expence of other scenes that were cut out. Gone are many of the good battle scenes, much of the comedy, different dialogue and music, and a different ending that is lousy. Overall, this version is different, more of a standard horror movie. I always believe there is merit in what the director intended, but this is one of those cases where the alternate version was the better one.<br />The behind-the-scenes featurette presented by Bruce Campbell is excellent, as always. I always love his commentaries and his voice overs, he is always insightful and can always laugh at himself. As good as the extras are, though, it doesn't make the package. If you already own the Theatrical Version and the Director's &quot;Bootleg&quot; Edition, I wouldn't bother with this one. That is unless you have too much money burning a hole in your pocket.
B00006RIO7|2.0|now, this was a story written a long time ago. but it still falls flat. the songs are unemotional and stupid. the beats are too modern, now sounding like something that was trying to be a hip CD. the music was supposed to sound old and untouched. the lyrics can be funny, but are not top noch. if you need to listen to a good musical, listen to Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge was much better than Chicago. Chicago, in my opinion, was just trying too hard...
0804102988|5.0|Edward Rutherfurd's &quot;Sarum: The Novel of England&quot; is simply wonderful. Much like the outstanding novels of James Michener, it begins thousands of years B.C. with family of primitive people and jumps through history with each succeeding chapter, focusing on a new individual each time. This method of storytelling requires a huge amount of research, but is highly effective in my opinion. You will be surprised how quickly you become attached and sympathetic (or the opposite, in some instances) to the new character(s) when a new chapter is introduced. This is the type of novel that will really make you think about how easy our modern day lives are, when compared to the tough, and often brutal, lives people of past centuries have had to endure. It will also make you consider your own life, and how brief it really is in the grand scheme of things. If you are a British person, or a person of British decent, be it Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, Norman, ect., this novel will certainly give you insight into how your ancestors lived their lives. The only downside to this novel, and any other novel of this style, is that some chapters are superior to others. For instance, I found &quot;Journey to Sarum&quot;, &quot;Sorviodunum&quot;, &quot;A Journey from Sarum&quot;, and &quot;Empire&quot; to be brilliant chapters that resonated with me more than some of the others. Regardless, the whole book is excellent and I encourage you to read it.
0451169514|5.0|I first read Stephen King's \\"IT\\" when I was 13 years old. I had been on a camping trip with my fellow Brownies, and they were giggling about the graphic language he used. 12 years later, it is still my favorite book, and I am about to buy my second copy; for the first is all but torn in half from the many readings.<br />When I first read it, it was my first \\"BIG book.\\" I had read books that were around 500 pages, but this one was closer to 1100! I read \\"IT\\" in under three days, I LITERALLY could not put it down.<br />King tells the tale of 7 childhood friends from (where else?) Maine. These 7 friends are known as the \\"Loser's Club.\\" However, it is not their social status as children that holds them together as adults, but a pact. A pact that they made promising they'd come back if IT came back.<br />King divides his attentions between the Loser's Club then and now. We learn their deepest fears and desires. We feel like the invisible 8th member.<br />If I would have any complaint with \\"IT,\\" it would be that it's not 5000 pages. ;Þ
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I heard about this album from a friend.  Never having heard the catchy first single \\"All The Things She Said\\" I took a chance and decided to buy this CD.  I was so shocked at how good it was...if I had heard all these songs before buying the CD, I wouldn't have minded paying $... for it!  It's so good and every single song will gt stuck in your head.  Your mind will be a total mess after listening to this album but that's a good thing!
0679746048|4.0|I read this book with high hopes. Ultimately, I wasn't disappointed.<br />&quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; is the true story of writer Susanna Kaysen's teenage years. After attempting suicide, she is forced to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital. She is diagnosed as &quot;borderline personality disorder.&quot; This &quot;disorder&quot; is one that affects almost every woman in the country, no matter how sane they are. The novel also introduces us to the women who share Susanna's life. Some will get to see the outside world again, some won't.<br />The reason I gave this novel only 4 stars is because I felt that it lacked something. Usually, I can read a book over and over again. For Girl, Interrupted, I'd have to be REALLY bored. Maybe it's that Kaysen didn't give us enough to emotionally identify with the characters. Still, Kaysen is a brave woman and I respect her story.
B0000025RQ|5.0|I got into Judas Priest when I heard their hit song off this album, You've Got Another Thing Comin'. So, since I thought the song rocked, I bought Screaming For Vengeance. I was amazed, to say the least. I instantly loved Judas Priest, I loved the classic rock / metal sound they could make and they just totally rocked. At least every song is great here.<br />The Hellion - An instrumental intro, that leads into Electric Eye. This sounds so cool, it's pretty slow and is a perfect intro.<BR>Electric Eye - One of the higher points of the album. It's pretty upbeat and has a cool solo in it. This will probably end up being one of your favorite songs on the album.<BR>Riding On The Wind - This songs about at the same pace as Electric Eye. Although it's not as catchy, the guitar solo is amazing.. lots of pinch harmonics.<BR>Bloodstone - This is one of the few songs on the album that is just like, whatever it's rock. It's good but not the best<BR>(Take These) Chains - Pretty much the same deal as Bloodstone. But hey, it's awesome anyway.<BR>Pain And Pleasure - This song is like, really slow and also one of the average songs of the album.<BR>Screaming For Vengeance - You know the title tracks always have to be great. This is no exception. The song is fast, and absolutley rocks. Rob really screams here, and the solo just rips it up.<BR>You've Got Another Thing Comin'- This song is quite possibly Judas Priest's biggest hit ever. It's just unforgettable, and very popular too. The best song on the album.<BR>Fever - This songs actually got some clean parts in it and overall it's pretty good. It's somewhat foreshadowing what the Turbo album would later sound like ...<BR>Devil's Child - Great. I really like the beat in this one and it's just one of those excellent songs. Steady and heavy.<br />Well there you have it. This is definetly Judas Priest's biggest thing to date. If one album were to stand out among all others this would definetly be it.
B00000DFFO|4.0|i've owned this cd for a while..<br />being german-american, this cd's very 'german', if you know what i mean....<br />very danceable. very 80's/new wave..<br />true.. it is basically like their original cd, but definitely a must have if you like propaganda..<br />it's basically the same their original cd, mixed differently, or maybe even better..<br />i like this cd a lot, and it's usually with me when i travel..<br />i recommend it...
B00007AJGH|2.0|I cannot believe this! I am outraged! DARN BUENA VISTA! They have given us the most shabbiest image that I have ever seen of WFRR. I did not see the original DVD which I'm sure was probably better, but on the new Vista DVD, the picture is destroyed. In certain areas the image is dark, muddy and hard to see through. In others, characters' colors darken and lighten. I am outraged! I hope that BV can fix this, because Roger Rabbit is one of my favorite movies and to see it destroyed like this outrages me. If you don't mind the shoddy image (it will not be noticed by people with smaller tvs but to those with a 27\\" or higher definition TVs will notice) get this DVD because the extras are fun to view and the DTS sound quality is amazing, its loud but at some points you can tell that the sound has somewhat deteriorated over the last 15 years. But it's still an okay release but I am going to be keeping the VHS tape that i've viewed many times since I was a little kid, until the image can be restored (I'm sure the original laserdisc probably had a better image). Oh well, but I'm still going to buy this just to have it on DVD! Sad, really, sad!
0345448898|5.0|I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this or not, but after seeing how much it ... off the religious zealots out there, I knew it couldn't be all bad. Thinking that, I read all three. I wasn't disappointed in the least. Not only were they good books with good stories, they were wonderfully contemptuous of religion in general, christianity in particular. It was what I had expected and more. Definitely delivered what I wanted.<br />...
B000084T18|2.0|This is probably one of the most over-rated CD's of our time. Don't get me wrong, this CD is aight, but not THAT nice. It is obvious that he sold all of these records because Dre gave him the now-very-annoying \\"In Da Club\\" beat, and Eminem gave him guest apperiances. I mean \\"In Da Club\\" is so out-played it's disgusting. The production is very nice, but 50's an average MC. Hook up Mos Def or Method Man with Dr. Dre and Eminem and they will sell just as much, or more records. It's pop, not rap. Real rap like Talib Kweli or Mos Def dosn't get played 40 times per day on MTV and 50 times a day on the pop radio. I also think that 50 shouldn't diss Ja Rule for singing and being pop because 50 sings just as much and he is just as, or more mainstreem then Ja. I should of just downloaded this. The standout tracks on this CD are \\"Many Men (Wish Death\\" and \\"Life's On The Line\\". \\"Wanksta\\" is over-rated also. Other than that Wanksta is a stupid...word. I think that 50 deserves 3 stars. Not less, not more. He is an average cat with Dre and Em to make him sell...
079284131X|5.0|I first watched this film when i was quite young, and then itwas deleted in the UK, but i managed to get a copy of the video on ebay.<BR>I'm not gonna waste time quoting what other people have already described the film as being, but i just wanted to say how worth while it is! I love the film and when it was deleted over here i thought i'd never get to see it again!<BR>All 3 sequals r good, but nuthin can beat this original...full of suspense and tense moments!<BR>Its well worth the buy!
B00005JLZ9|3.0|Well, i have already lose my hopes of watching John Travolta in a big hit again but this movie is okay.<BR> The story is about John Travolta, who investigates the disappearance of a legendary Army drill sergeant (Samuel L. Jackson) and a squad of his cadets after a training exercise in Panama.<BR> You will think ''I have already seen that in another movie before''. It tries to twist and turns everytime, and it kind of works. the thriller is not that intense but its worthy anyway!
B00005NGAL|5.0|I had the opportunity to experience &quot;CATS&quot; live in New York before it closed.  I will never forget the unbelievable set and effects.  This show was truly what Broadway is about.  Although not comparable to seeing it live, this dvd is a close as you get!  I recommend this ultimate edition to anyone that loves musical theatre.  It is a must have!
B00005JLSE|5.0|I just saw this movie and I have to say that I absolutly just LOVED it!...Catherine Zeta-Jones has a GREAT voice, and Rene Zelweger was great as Roxie Hart, it was like she was made for that roll. I was impressed with Richard Gere's tap dancing. My favourite numbers are the opening  and closing numbers, \\"Cell Block Tango\\" and a couple others that I can't remember the names of.There were times in the film where I caught myself tapping my foot along with the music. This was a GREAT way to escape for a short while the ugliness of reality, and just loose yourself in the story, songs and dances of \\"Chicago\\". At the end of the movie, I found myself applauding as if I had seen it live, and for the rest of the day, I couldn't get Catherine-Zeta Jones singing the main song out of my head. No wonder it won an Oscar for best picture. It's a GREAT movie! I loved the songs, choreography and the costumes. All I can say is, \\"WOW!\\"
B00008H2LB|5.0|My brother bought the CD a few days ago and he brought it over for me to listen to. Needless to say, I love it, espically &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;, &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, and &quot;Session&quot;. If you're avid Linkin Park fans like we are, then we recommend that you buy it.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Deep Space Nine was launched to some fanfare in 1993, and initially had a hard time finding an audience. Against all odds, it became one of the more successful series as yet produced. With a fan corps as devoted to show as the fans of the original series, more interpersonal conflict and a greater emphasis on drama than previous series, Deep Space Nine did gather a large group of fans. This was the only series where Star Trek truly departed from the (albeit good) formula of exploration and boldly going where nobody has gone before, and it succeeded admirably, in my opinion.<br />Both writing and acting were excellent, especially in the first season. The backdrop was perfectly set, giving us the backdrop of a society scarred from brutal occupation from the Cardassians. This show lives in the nuances and always manages to stay intelligent. The writing greatness extended far beyond mere exposition. The actors are given great dialogue, and they are given plenty of opportunity to shine. Avery Brooks is an extraordinary actor who, like Patrick Stuart, is able to state any line with intensity and conviction. Also like Stewart, he manages to add plenty of sophistication and nuance to his character, which makes Sisko the most fascinating character on the show, and perhaps Star Trek's Best Captain. Nana Visitor breaks the first officer trend: she actually presumes to debate some of Sisko's decisions (as opposed to Riker, who only disagreed when he wanted to beam down somewhere). Kira has both ferocity and determination, but also vulnerability and a deeply empathic spirit. Terry Farrell's Dax character remains much a mystery in this first season, but her wisdom and sereneness are appropriately portrayed by the actress. Armin Shimerman gives a particularly pleasant performance as Quark, the incorrigible capitalist. Odo also is an enigma at this point, but his desire to find the truth and search for justice and his displacement at being a changeling in a world of solids are madeknown early. Rene Auberjonois' best work was still to come, but he still comes off as a tortured soul, even here.<br />The first season featured only one space battle and a handful of firefights, but it had plenty of fascinating expositional episodes. \\"Emissary\\", the pilot, is a great way of beginning the series. Most of the key players are introduced, such as Ben Sisko, Starfleet Station Commander; Kira Nerys, Bajoran First Officer; Jadzia Dax, Science Officer; Julian Bashir, the wet behind the ears doctor who has a tendency to run off with the mouth; Miles O'Brien, the constantly frustrated Chief of Operations; Quark, the owner of the station's bar; and Odo, the enigmatic Security Chief. Others introduced later on were Garak, the spy/tailor; Gul Dukat, former Cardassian Prefect of Bajor; Vedek Bareil, religious leader and Kira's future love interest, and Vedek Winn, the scheming, maniacal religious leader. Other highlights include a hilarious visit from Q in \\"Q-less\\" (although it isn't hard to see why he didn't come back), an examination of Dax's past in \\"Dax\\", a Ferengi adventure in \\"The Nagus\\" where Quark becomes the head of Ferengi state, \\"Battle Lines\\", which feels like an episode torn from the original series, \\"Duet\\", a powerful episode exploring emotional scarring from the Cardassian Occupation, and \\"In the Hands of the Prophets\\", setting up the clash between Bajoran fundamentalists and progressives which would be a major part of storytelling for a long time. <br />Perhaps the reason that I like this show so much is because of the continual character development. As opposed to The Next Generation, where Data and Wesley and maybe Picard were the only characters that truly underwent any personal metamorphosis during the duration of the show, Deep Space Nine featured characters who were constantly reexamining their selves, relationships, and feelings, and this introspection allowed for plenty of great drama throughout the show. This is evident even in the firstseason of Deep Space Nine alone. Benjamin Sisko, the station commander, begins the show a weary, emotionally-burdened man who never truly dealt with his wife's death. By the end of the season he has fully immersed himself into his role as the leader of a culturally diverse station, with both Starfleet and Bajorans working hand in hand, and with himself being the bridge between them. Kira, as well, grows in this season. An ex-freedom fighter and fierce patriot, Kira has significant issues to deal with. In \\"Emissary\\" she responds to Sisko's statement that they are here to help by saying, \\"That's just what the Cardassians said forty years ago.\\" By the end of the season however, she admits to Sisko after a speech that he made, \\"I don't think you're the devil.\\" She goes from an angry, mistrustful fighter to a more balanced, more at peace woman. These are a few of the significant character changes that this season brought about.<br />In short, every other Star Trek show had crews venturing to new worlds, but this was the first one where one of those worlds was truly explored. The writing, acting, and drama were on a high level throughout the season. This is a collection to add to your DVD library, even if you're a non-trekkie, for this is a show that even a non-trekkie could easily lose him/herself in.
B000060P79|4.0|Simple Plan is a Canadian Pop-Punk-Emo band.  Honestly I am a huge fan of this genre, but for some reason this CD doesn't do it for me.  Don't get me wrong, the songs are all well written and performed, but it's not a top notch album.  (3.5 stars)<br />1.  I'd Do Anything-  A great written song w/ good guitar and drums, a very good emotional song. 4/5<br />2.  The Worst Day Ever-  I don't really like the sound of this song, the lyrics are great but guitar is a bit weird sounding. 3/5<br />3.  You Don't Mean Anything- THE BEST SONG on this album and definately a GREAT emo song, I love this song, its very catchy and just is perfect, very well written.<br />4.  I'm Just A Kid-  A very cool song about growing up with good lyrics and music. 4/5<br />5.  When I'm With You- A good emo song, well written and decent guitar, 3/5<br />6.  Meet You There-  A slower, good song about relationships, nicely written. 4/5<br />7.  Addicted-  A very great song, one of the best on here, everyone can relate to this song once in their life, and its just spectacular. 5/5<br />8.  My Alien- A decent, slower paced song with good lyrics. 4/5<br />9.  God Must Hate Me- This is one of the songs that I don't like, it starts off way to fast with annoying guitar parts, it's really lyrically written well, but the music isn't too good. 3/5<br />10.  I Won't Be There-  An all around good song with nice lyrics and beats. 4/5<br />11.  One Day-  A real winner on this album, its a very good song instrumentally and lyrically. 5/5<br />12.  Perfect-  A pretty cool slower type song, with nice lyrics and guitar- 4/5<br />13.  Grow Up- A cool, song about not wantin to grow up and stayin young and having fun. 4/5<br />Simple Plan's album is not bad, but there is better out there.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This is LP's best CD<BR>all of the songs are really good<BR>this is a CD that you can put in a CD and tell it to repeat that 1 CD untill you've listened to the whole CD about 20 or 30 times (not really 20 or 30 times but more like 7 or 8 then you have to do something else bcuz you've spent all day listening to one CD)<BR>but this is a really good CD so even if you don't buy the Limited Edition of this CD you should still buy this CD
B000069HK2|4.0|I first heard &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; and loved it.  I checked out the album and it definately wasn't what I expected, but it was very good.  Its definately a awesome hardcore emo album.  <br />1.  Maybe Memories-  A great hardcore emo song.  I like how it goes hardcore vocals into sort of a melodic tune.  Great guitar parts and lyrics. 5/5<br />2.  The Taste of Ink- One of the best songs on the album.  Its very catchy and has great guitar parts.  5/5<br />3.  Bullimic-  This kinda music gets me pumped up.  From the beginning to the end this song is great w/ guitar and lyrics. 4/5<br />4.  Say Days Ago-  More of a hardcore punk song, it has some good parts to it but not one of my favorites. 3/5<br />5.  Poetic Tragedy-  Starts of nice and slow and stays that way most of the time, the vocals are real good in this song. 4/5<br />6.  Buried Myself Alive-  A very cool song with great guitar and vocals, I really like this one. 5/5<br />7.  Box of Sharp Objects-  My favorite song on the album, Nice and hard emo, great guitar and vocals. 5/5<br />8.  Blue and Yellow- Starts with a piano and nice guitar playing, a slower type song w/ good lyrics. 4/5<br />9.  Greener With the Scenery-  Another song that starts slow, but picks up later with great vocals and fast paced drums and guitar. 4/5<br />10.  Noises and Kisses-  A great emo song and great lyrically. 5/5<br />11.  On My Own-  A nice slow song that you can just sit down and chill to.  Nice vocals. 4/5<br />12.  Pieces Mended-  A nice hard song to end the album with.  4/5.<br />Overall &quot;The Used&quot; is a great CD but if your buying it for the Tast of Ink your going to hear songs completely different. Great album.
B00004TH83|4.0|I bought this album because I was a big Celine fan. Lara Fabian sounds, at times, too much like Celine but the songs are very good. She over sings a little but that is not a complaint because I love strong vocalist. The one song, &quot;Till I Get Over You&quot; is the only flaw because of her use of profanity. But the rest of the ballads are awesome!!
0062502182|5.0|I picked up a copy of The Alchemist because it was well reviewed and looked interesting.  I decided to chance a purchase on the hope that it would be a good book.<br />I was not disappointed.  While many negative reviewers of this book have critiqued its poor character development, it is written as a fairy tale, which is more plot-based than character-based.  This should not be construed as a flaw.  It's a simple book, finding no necessity in telling you what color hair the general that Santiago meets has.  The important aspect of this book is the journey.<br />And journey it is, taking Santiago the shepherd boy from Spain to Egypt and back again, without a boring moment between.  Santiago discovers many truths along his journey, the most critical being the importance of the journey itself.<br />If you like fairy tales, are feeling disheartened, or still consider yourself a dreamer, this book is for you.
B000067CPX|3.0|Now, before I get slaughtered, I'd like to make it clear that I UNDERSTAND bands need to evolve and change their music. I'm only saying I don't like this direction for this band. I heard the first single/title track and thought &quot;hey, this sounds like the funk metal I'm used to hearing, like the days of BloodSugarSexMagik.&quot; Turns out I was wrong. This album is mostly the bland &quot;alternative&quot; rock from the second half of &quot;Californication.&quot; <br />However, there was one other bright spot. The song &quot;Warm Tape.&quot; It's &quot;breaking the Girl&quot; with the guitar taken further into psychedelia.<br />I can't really recommend this album. Go buy the old albums first, namely Mothers Milk and BSSM. This'll give you a picture of the REAL Chili Peppers.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I just saw this movie on the big screen yesterday, and learned while skimming Amazon today that it's due on DVD in about 2 weeks! Well, let me tell you, I'm so glad I saw it on the big screen, because a large part of the amazing film \\"Spirited Away\\" is its absolute beauty; the color, animation, the look and feel of the movie SCREAM for the big screen, and I'm only sorry I saw it dubbed and not in its original Japanese. But for sure, this is one movie I will be buying the very day of its release.<br />The plot is nominal -- a young girl is moving to a new city with her parents, feeling isolated and a little afraid at this new venture in her young life. On the way to their new home, her father takes what he believes to be a shortcut to their house, but instead they wind up in front of an entrance to a bizarre-looking tunnel. In front of the entrance sits a stone statue that is too big for the car to go around so, curious, the parents decide to check out the strange-looking building with the tunnel on foot. Their little girl, immediately fearing something is wrong here, has to be cajoled into going -- and this sets off a bizarre adventure for Chihiro (the girl) that you have to see to believe; she soon ends up all alone in a VERY strange land.<br />Saying more would be giving stuff away, so let me just say that Chichiro is indeed \\"spirited away\\" to a world where she must learn to be strong in order to save herself -- and her parents -- from being stuck there forever. On the way she meets both friends and enemies of all shapes, sizes . . . and worlds. <br />This is one heck of a movie, one of my favorites and candy for the eye as well as the mind. Beautifully made and well-crafted, anyone meeting Chihiro will immediately love her, and root 150% for her success.<br />My ONLY negative in seeing this fine film comes from the actual theatergoing experience itself -- because the film is being distributed by Disney in the USA, there were MANY children in the audience, from babies to early teens. PLEASE NOTE: this is NOT a movie for very young children, by any means -- some images might disturb them, some \\"monsters\\" in the film may be too intense for kids under, say, 7 years of age. One woman down the aisle from me walked out with her four daughters less than ten minutes into the film.<br />This is NOT a \\"Disney movie\\" by any means, it's Japanimation -- some of the finest I've seen, and -- as much as I also love \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" -- I can see completely why \\"Spirited Away\\" won the Oscar a week ago for Best Animated Film. A brilliant movie, it would be an honor to have it in any movie-lover's DVD collection.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album is amazing me. It is similar to first album. Linkin Park's music is more pewerful any other rock music. I think. shock! shock! Just can say.. when I had heard \\"in the end\\", their first album title song, I can understand their music themes, you know. but I can not find out their sound style until listening Meteora album. Meteora has strong electric sounds and powerful vocal sounds. Energetic sounds and scratching sounds are mixed up this album. May you say like this: Their song had not changed after \\"Hybrid theory\\" but if you are listen carefully, you can go to another rock world.<BR> <BR> This album's title song is \\"Somewhere I Belong\\". It start poweful guitar sound, and slowly get to the climax with energetic voice. This song has slow beat and short internal beat. It makes much fantastic sounds. Just good and great. \\"Dont't stay\\" are shouting vocal and scatching sound which is made of more powerful beats. \\"Lying from you\\" is strange song because it has not clearly sound, but mid part of this song reveal so fast rapping and shouting vocal sound which are lead to me more upset emotional atmosphere. \\"Hit the floor\\" has stop and slow sound. Lower vocal sound make me comfortable emotion. It can be harmony vocal and sound. you know. \\"Easier to Run\\" has powerful electric guitar sound. This song is more emotinal than any other song in this album. Just listen without lyrics, and you can feel charmed their another voice. \\"Faint\\" has so fast beats and raps. It is more enjoyable my mind. but you can see power is in weak sound. Please enjoy this fast beat song. There are energetic guitar sounds in \\"figure. 09\\". It is very suitable on sound and hard vocal. Shout vocal makes your heart utmost beating. It is simple way to get rid of your stressed mind, I think. \\"Breaking the Habit\\"'s sound is so simple beat, I know. So in my case I just felt that is so boring sound.. Certainly not... What do you feeling about this song? \\"From the inside\\" has very beautiful vocal, so youcan feel their mixed up sound that is fantastic guitar sound and shouting vocal sound. One~~two and three beat is much easy to understand their music idea. \\"Nobody's Listening\\" has atmosphere arabian world, you know. Watch out! Cobra can be winded your body! U~~~ It's horrible thinking, huh? Please be careful. Don't be shy about the cobra is loving you. Just feel rhytmn and non fiction. \\"Session\\" has powful drum sound. The more fast sound, the more deep sound in this song. No voice. Only scratching and beating sound. There is fashionable sound in \\"Nump\\". It is more emotional sound making our mind so happy.<BR> <BR> Linkin Park had tried to more change their album color in \\"Meteora.\\" It is smilar to their first album color, also. But we can find out after listening their music which is charmed with shouting, scratching, beating, and so fast rapping. It is combined with energetic guitar sound and shouting vocal sound. That is harmony. It makes very fantastic music. Freely listen Linkin Park's album , if you have a chance, and it is your favorite album.... Have a try and Good luck!
B00008LDPU|5.0|OMG!  I will buy this as soon as it is released so I can have my own personal copy of Final Flight of the Osiris!  I've seen it at least 10 times already and I can't get enough.  Square Pictures is incredible!  These guys have yet to get the credit they deserve for both this short film and Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.  Their animation is groundbreaking and is just the begininng of new filmmaking.  Critics really annoy me too because the animation isn't perfect yet, well so what?  It takes time folks, if this studio just had more support behind them they would have a masterpiece within 5 years!  But no, the critics don't think the characters look real enough and that real actors are better.  I say, let the technology improve, PLEASE give them more opportunities to make feature films!  PLEASE!
B00005JLSC|5.0|thank heavens for Chicago a film that has finally brought the Hollywood musical back into the public's imagination.After the fun but trashy Moulin Rouge,Chicago can proudly show that even in this cynical age a Hollywood studio can still produce a musical that can stand alonside such classics of the genre such as My Fair Lady and Caberet.<BR> Stylish production,terrfic performances from actors singing in fine voice (even though Zeta-Jones manages to steal the show)makes Chicago the film of 2003.
B00006LFGD|5.0|When the double-CD Essential was released a few months before this, I was disappointed that some great duets were missing, although all the important solo tracks were included. I was therefore particularly pleased to be able to buy this collection. All the duets that were included on Essential - You don't bring me flowers, No more tears, Guilty, Tell him and I finally found someone - are reprised here, but they couldn't have been omitted from either, being among Barbra's biggest hits.<br />Two newly recorded songs - I won't be the one to let go and All I know of love - bookend this collection, no doubt included to ensure that Barbra's most fanatical supporters need this.<br />Some of the songs here reflect Barbra's acting career, including I finally found someone (from The mirror has two faces), Lost inside of you (from A star is born), two tracks from Back to Broadway (I have a love / One hand one heart and The music of the night) and Ding dong the witch is dead (a cover of song from The Wizard of Oz).<br />Everything here is brilliant, but my particular favorites are Make no mistake he's mine (a song that topped the country chart when recorded by Kenny Rogers and Ronnie Milsap as Make no mistake she's mine), If you ever leave me and You don't bring me flowers.<br />If you enjoy any of Barbra's music, you will love this collection.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Ok first off whoever said this was hybrid part 2 [is wrong]. This is 10 times better! When LP firdt came out I didn't know what the big deal was. I mean they were ok but not worth the attention they were getting. But this is by far the best cd I have boughten in a long time. Probly the best of 2003. They leaned more towards the rock/metal category with this one which I think was a genious move. Chester totally ripps it up on this cd. They went from being Limp Bizkit without the cussin to something totally worthy of Ozzfest. Anyone who loves to see the hardcore side of LP must buy this.
B000065U1N|5.0|One of the best war movies I've ever seen.Very graphic but awesome.
B00005JKWI|1.0|For a movie that was supposed to be real great, I thought it was a piece of junk! Throughout the whole movie they did nothing but fight. It's real great if you like guys showing off their martial arts skills, but it gets a little boring after a while. I recommend renting it, before buying it.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Jennifer lopez's debut album is a great cd! I love it. Songs like if you had my love, waiting for tonight, no me ames, and feelin' so good are great songs on here!!! I love them all. I suggest that you buy this cd, its well worth the money.
0385504209|5.0|Brown's book is captivating and full of knowledge, besides supplying a story which is unrivaled. Awesome ending.
0767836286|4.0|Arlington Road is one of the most well constructed movies that has come along in a long time. It has a unique way of showing the viewer both sides of the story. Having Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins in this film was a wise choice. Great DVD, would only be better if it were in both widescreen and full screen. A+
B00008H2LB|5.0|One of my friends is the biggest Linkin Park fan, and so after listening to Hybrid Theory and Reanimation over and over again I was so excited when Meteora came out, and it hasn't disappointed me at all. It gets you hooked from the CD burner breaking intro all the way to the killer ending track Numb. It has a very similar sounds to Hybrid Theory, especially Don't Stay. I kept expecting to hear the infamous &quot;SHUT UP's&quot; as in One Step Closer, but that song and the whole CD is still a classic. One of my favorite songs is &quot;Faint&quot; which brings out a more upbeat tempo with an original intro and message. I never thought that I'd enjoy all the screaming and loudness to any band, but Linkin Park has proved me wrong. This is a truly quality album and I suggest everyone to go out and buy it.
B00006BTCA|5.0|So what can I say that hasn't been said about this disc that hasn't been said before? Actually, not a hell of a lot, except that the Joy Division comparisions are getting tiresome, but there is a reason they are apt. For starters the music is echoey dense and at times, claustrophobic. Then the lead singer's voice sometimes hits that deep register that Ian Curtis so often hit. But at that point, I think we can end some of those comparisions. For one thing, there is the brittle yet brilliant guitar work that brings to mind bands of yore like Television and latter day ones like Bedhead or even Mogwai's best moments. There is an emotionalism inside the music that none of the aforementioned bands can even touch, and this is best exemplified by the love-hate anthem of &quot;NYC&quot; a beautiful, dark moment in music (next to the Verlaines' &quot;Crisis after Crisis&quot;, of course, but that song isn't commercially available in the US of A) on an album full of them. The album begins in a jet propelled angst (God, I hate that word...) of &quot;Untitled&quot; and never really lets up. Songs like &quot;Obstacle 1&quot; (sheer brilliance and nice guitar riffing at that...), &quot;PDA&quot; (nice rhythm driven track) and &quot;Say Hello to the Angels&quot; (great title, nice guitar riff, great imagery, killer hook--out-Strokes the Strokes even). Quite frankly, this is the only disc of 2002 or for the longest while that did not have a second of filler, considering even the best discs have some, so there's your recommendation. The best band from New York City, better even than the Strokes and the overhyped Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Sheer brilliance.
6305603847|5.0|- Pink, (Bob Geldof) is the main character in this remarkable movie directed by Alan Parker. Pink is a Rock star who spends most of his time locked in a hotel room watching classic war movies from his TV-set with a lot of [bad] channels...then slowly he starts losing his mind as he reminisces about his past, that brought him to the isolation from the world. The whole story of \\"The wall\\" unfolds by the phenomenal, fantastic songs made by Pink Floyd. It is so important to add that Gerald Scarfe,a prominent cartoonist, played a great role on making this movie a huge success.<BR>If you happen to like,Pink Floyd's music,this movie is a must have and a must see.Until I now I've had it only on video tape and I have watched it tens of times and now when I have it on DVD I'll watch it hundreds of times as this movie never gets boring and because this movie everytime you watch it gives you a new understanding of it.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Cant seem to keep my kids off the playstation now!  My only problem was that it took a couple of weeks to get here.  I saw the same memory card at kaybee toy store for the same price.  So with the exception of the time it took to get here, it did its job!  My kids could pass and finally finish the games.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Yes, it is no lie. Meteora is even better than Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was simply incredible. I'm so happy that Linkin Park didn't sell out and make all of their songs sound like &quot;In the End&quot; since they had such a success with that song. Instead, Meteora is much heavier than their first effort, Hybrid Theory. The music is better, the lyrics are more mature, and the vocals by both Chester Benington and Mike Shinoda have improved greatly. I definently recommend this album. It's what every rock fan has been waiting for.
0060005424|5.0|Garth Nix changed the face of dark fantasy (usually just horror with a prettier cover) with his instant hit \\"Sabriel,\\" which provided fans with a unique magical system, a well-crafted alternate world, and talking animals that were anything but cute. \\"Lirael\\" follows closely in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, and might be even better than the first book.<br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. But now she's fourteen, and is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight. After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library. She inadvertantly sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature, a Stilken that will call other Free Magic creatures and destroy the Clayr. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic) and soon ends up finding out more about her past -- and her future.<br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's son Sameth is pursued by the Dead, and is almost killed in the process; the only thing he gets for his trouble is a threat from a mysterious necromancer. Sam is supposed to be the future Abhorsen, but the problem is that he's petrified by the things his mother handles easily. And he's helped loose Free Magic on a world increasingly torn by a mysterious masked necromancer...<br />Nix takes the rich world he created in \\"Sabriel\\" and makes it even richer. It's a bit like a melding of typical high fantasy with an early twentieth-century setting (phones, buses, cricket matches, electricity, guns). Old faves like Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget appear here (although Mogget's appearance is a bit brief), along with new and equally likable characters.<br />Some readers may not like Lirael as well as they liked the more self-assured, kick-butt Sabriel, but Lirael is in a vastly different position. Sabriel knew who she was, where she was coming from, and knew what she needed to know, while Lirael is only learning those things. She becomes stronger and more self-assured as she learns more about Charter magery and her background. The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was. Sam is endearingly unsure of himself, and is one of the few fantasy characters to be genuinely terrified of his \\"duties,\\" not just apprehensive. His sister was the one character who fell flat; she seemed a little too \\"bossy princess.\\"<br />\\"Lirael\\" has the same balance of humor and horror as the first book. We have things like the bodies of refugees being turned into decayed Dead Hands, the clawed insecto-human Stilken, or just the aura of darkness around the Book of the Dead. But we also have funny things like Nick or the running joke about the Dog and food.<br />The biggest problem with \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr\\" is that it ends on a \\"to be continued\\" note. So be sure to have the concluding novel, \\"Abhorsen,\\" ready while you read this book.

B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is an awesome album, especially for a band's debut. I got this CD around the time that &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot; just got onto the radio. I found the songs to be full of heavy riffs, great scratches and samples, and catchy but meaningful lyrics. I fell in love with Linkin Park almost immediately. The difference from this album and most rap rock albums is that the lyrics don't contain profanity, while most rap rockers use profanity in their lyrics whether it's needed or not at that point in the song. Also, it has a much lighter feel to it. If you have only heard &quot;In the End&quot; on the radio, you may not like this CD, because the other songs are much more heavy. I definently recommend this album along with the remix collection entitled &quot;Reanimation&quot; to anyone who wants to listen to truly great music.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Ignore the people who just want entertainment and don't want to &quot;think&quot; while viewing this great movie.  Yes it is almost 3 hours long, but I watched it on 2 consecutive days, and twice more since I bought the DVD.  This is a great cast with a great story (or should I say stories) to tell.  If your not a Tom Cruise fan, don't worry;  Cruise plays a character like he never has before.  This is a great movie.
0897500482|3.0|If you want to get inside Lee's head and see JKD through his eyes, this is a good book. The bad news is, the info is scattered all over the place, the illustrations are often quite unclear, and a lot of text is repeated in his other smaller books (Skill in techniques for example). If you're experienced in martial arts you may find a lot of useful things, about feinting and speed. If you're not, go practice at your local martial arts school, THEN buy the book. I wasn't really dissapointed with the book cause Lee never got to actually finishing it. As long as you look at it as a collection of ideas about what JKD is according to Lee, then it's a good book.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Meteora is a very good CD. It has a lot more computer generated sounds and effects than Hybrid Theory, but they sound good.  The songs are all very linkin parkish.. the songs all have the same format pretty much.  What ..., is that it's only a little over 35 minutes.  I rated all of the songs on the album to show what you should download or what you are about to buy...<br />1. Foreword - I don't know why this wasn't just put in the beginning of the next song. I mean, it's only 13 seconds and it goes well with the transition to track 2.<br />2. Don't Stay - This song has a cool intro beat, and a pretty good chorus. It is a good opening song for the album. 9/10<br />3. Somewhere I Belong - Good single. Great song. Yup. 10/10<br />4. Lying From You - Has a cool melody in the beginning, but is like all Linkin Park songs. Pretty good chorus. 8/10<br />5. Hit the Floor - Cool guitar effect and intro. Mike is not the best rapper I've heard, and this song proves it. Weird effect on the chorus, but it's pretty good. 7/10<br />6. Easier to Run - Good slow song and a good chorus. Very good drum part for this song. Whole song is good except for the fact that Mike Shinoda says \\"I would\\" about 30 times in the song, literally. 8/10<br />7. Faint - Cool melody and good beat for the intro. Mike actually raps pretty well in this song, and the chorus is very good. Good song. 9/10<br />8. Figure.09 - Nice guitar intro. Rappin is alright, but the chorus is better. This song should be called Part of Me, but they already have a song called that, so that's probably why they called this song Figure.09. 8/10<br />9. Breaking the Habit - This song, I think, is the best on the album. The melody goes very well with the drums, even though they are probably made by machines. They had a real orchestra in this song, though, and it sounds very good. Sweet chorus, and it was a good choice not to have Mike in this song. 10/10<br />10. From the Inside - This song is in 6/8 time, and it was done very well. I think this is their only song they've done in 6/8, so it was different. The verse goes well with the chorus. 9/10<br />11. Nobody's Listening - This song is different, but sounds very cool. It has a Japanese flute and a simple beat. The chorus sounds nice. This is a song that should have rapping for sure, and it does. 10/10<br />12. Session - Nothing will ever be as good as Cure for the Itch from Hybrid Theory, but it is alright. 9/10<br />13. Numb - I think they were trying to make this song dramatic for the end of the album just like Pushing Me Away was on Hybrid Theory. It is just as good except for Mike Shinoda when he says \\"Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow.\\" It's almost like he's trying to ruin the song. But it's still a very good song. 10/10<br />This CD is definately worth buying. I don't think it is as good as Hybrid Theory, but others my think otherwise. The DVD isn't really worth buying.  It just talks about them recording the album.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This album is absolutely wonderful!!! I like this album because they sound so diverse in that they mange to have many different sounds(techno, hip-hop, rap-rock, and alternitive) all in one cd. They even manage to sound a little industrial on track 12, almost like NIN. My only complaint about this CD is that its only around 40 minutes long, but the qaulity of this CD musically well supercedes the length of the CD tracks. I was thoroughly surprised at how great this CD sounded, and quickly forgot its few faults after one good listen of the CD. I highly recommend this to any Linkin Park fan, and for those who like good unique music.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver finds the lads shedding their bubblegum pop capes once and for all freely embracing the sounds of Abbey Road, Bob Dylan, and India.  Simply, this is an absolutely remarkable endeavor.  A record that would change the face of music once and for all.  No longer is pop music simply about commercialism.  Now, it became a form of artistic expression free to embrace all cultures and instantly accessible to everyone.  What makes this album all the more remarkable is that it did all of this in under 40 minutes!

B000002O3I|5.0|To those considering this as their next purchase, it is best you consider has turned to The Rocking Chair and Moanin' in the Moonlight in their careers for inspiration: The Doors, Cream, the original Fleetwood Mac, the Grateful Dead, Stevie Ray Vaughan (quite often), the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and George Thorgood, just to start. With a list like this, it could be said that Howlin' Wolf, with these '50s singles, practically invented the classic rock star! As you can see, you are probably a Wolf fan without even realizing it, for this combination of Chicago's electric, rockin' boogie and the Delta's moody, violent , innuendo (mixed with his signature raw, primal, growl) provides a &quot;How to...&quot; for the blues and rock and roll as it has been done for the past 50 years!<br />Back then nothing came across with such force and raucousness back and then, and very little does now. So to learn where rock and roll learned how to rock and roll at the cheapest price possible, &quot;wang dang doodle&quot; all night long to the boogie blues master, Howlin' Wolf!
B00005Y1Y3|2.0|Think about it.  Who's going to buy this?  Thank God it's limited--at least they admit they'll try to get a quick buck and run.  If you're really into rare live Doors material, chances are you'll go out and get the full double-disc sets from Bright Midnight that this single disc is culled from.<br />BUT, of course, this disc has tracks appearing nowhere else.  So now you can kindly pay the Doors once again for material you already have (if you get the other sets.)<br />The Doors will pretty much never miss a chance to sell you something you already have.  I love this band, but the treatment of the live and recorded output by both band and record company has been shameless.  At least they got Bright Midnight going.  (After claiming that the tapes they're releasing now didn't exist.)  But hey, they already got fans to buy a box set that had yet another greatest hits in it as well as another box set of studio albums remastered yet again...and didn't even both releasing the non-Morrison Doors albums.<br />If you can find this used somehow, get it to hear the stuff that hasn't been released on other Bright Midnight discs.  Otherwise, go and get the full shows.  The Doors are rich enough already.

0380789035|4.0|It is hard to find the words with which to accurately describe this unique novel.  I was at times charmed by the beautiful way in which the lead character comes to life.  That said I was disturbed from the outset at the strange and tragic turn of events.  Rarely does a novel set you up so well with the first few pages.<br />I would love to describe the story, and will attempt to, although this book may just be one which has to be experienced to be believed.  It is somewhat a tale of a man caught in a battle of ancient gods from mythology like Odin, and includes bar brawls with leprechauns and such.  The lead character is hired to be an \\"errand man\\" for a forgotten \\"god\\" trying to battle American society's new \\"gods\\" of television, technology, and the Internet, which are brought to life as actual beings.  The author does such a tremendous job of weaving the story from the viewpoint of a man so deeply haunted by a recent loss and betrayal that what he experiences in the supernatural is almost taken with a calm disinterest.  The story weaves back and forth with lightning speed between dream, reality and the supernatural, leaving a dreamy feeling while reading.<br />Also dispersed throughout the book are, out of nowhere, brief description of other &quot;gods&quot; and events, which read like a rich tapestry of history to a degree where I was looking for footnotes.  I will say this; Mr. Gaiman has an incredible imagination!<br />This is a rather strange book, it is at times a page-turning, stay up all night to finish novel, and at other times goes a bit too far into the horror and graphic depictions of a Stephen King. Some of the more graphic depictions seemed to be unnecessary to the storyline. This should serve as a warning for those who cringe easily.  Despite these drawbacks, I was hooked into the story from the start, and wanted to finish it as fast as I could.  That is itself high praise for a novel.  Well done, strange and overly graphic, but a well written and compelling story.mpelling story.
B000089RVX|5.0|This band has done it. The music has a wide variety, going from soothing music to upbeat rock. CDs usually contain a couple of songs that are great, but this cd breaks that rule and is filled with amazing songs that are really catchy. <BR>Tthe angelic voice of Amy Lee completes the cd. I'd have to say that I haven't heard a cd like this in a long time. Every single song is packed with great musicianship. <br />The only bad thing about this cd is that you'll be using up all your batteries in your cd player listening to it time and time again. :)<br />This is definately worth buying. #1

In spite of dealing with death, this short little book is about life and love and enjoying what you have when things look the most bleak. It's more about giving and accepting than about losing.<BR>Morrie Schwartz, losing his body bit by bit to Lou Gerhig's disease, offers what is in his heart and mind and, in doing so, lives life rather fully to the very end. His former student, Mitch Albom, visiting on Tuesdays, accepts the gift of his mentor's humor and wisdom, and then passes it on to us along with Morrie's biggest lesson:  \\"Love wins.\\"  <BR>I laughed and cried and was content at the end, in spite of Morrie's inevitable death.
B00005RYLE|4.0|The Evil Dead (Sam Raimi, 1982)<br /><br />What is it possible to say about Sam Raimi's classic video nasty that has not been said already? If you haven't already heard of The Evil Dead, you've likely been living in a cave for the past twenty years. if you haven't seen it, you've likely been living in Great Britain. But I digress.<br /><br />The Evil Dead is the most basic of stories (whoops! we let these demons out, see...) shot on the most shoestring of budgets ($150,000, in six weeks), using no-name actors, many of whom were also behind-the-scenes participants. Nothing is ever explained, no reasons for all this occurring are handed us. It just is.<br /><br />Sound familiar? It ought to. George Romero had done the same thing almost fifteen years before and created a monstrous smash hit on the underground cinema circuit in Night of the Living Dead, to this day the most influential horror film ever made. The Evil Dead followed in Night's tradition, of course, becoming the first of the \\"video nasties\\" (or so the liner notes in Book of the Dead crow... we'll  just ignore Peeping Tom, banned in 1960,for the moment, shall we?) banned for so long in Britain. (That has since, thankfully, been rectified.)<br /><br />Another way in which Evil Dead has gone on to imitate night is in the breadth of its influence over film-not just in horror, but in all walks of life. Camera tricks used in The Evil Dead are often replicated today to get the same effects (The Blair Witch Project made use of Evil Dead-style camerawork to nauseating effect, as does the opening of Tornatore's A Pure Formality), the ripped Hills Have Eyes poster in one scene in the Evil Dead sparked a decade-long rivalry between Raimi and Wes Craven (and playing \\"spot the ripped poster\\" in the films of both is just as amusing as playing \\"Spot the Hitchcock\\"), mini-homages to scenes in The Evil Dead can be found around the map. It has truly become a classic; it did for the popularity of giallo in America what Night of the Living Dead did for the classic horror film.<br /><br />One other odd similarity between the two: the vast majority of the actors therein never went onto another role. Male lead Bruce Campbell, obviously, not only went on to The Evil Dead II and III, but Darkman, The Adventures of Brisco County Jr., The Hudsucker Proxy, and the Spider-Man franchise, to name only a few. What of the other four main actors? Ellen Sandweiss gets her first role since in 2003 with Satan's Playground, the new flick from the inimitable Dante Tomaselli (Desecration, Horror). Theresa Tilly, who went by the stage name Sarah York in the film, resurfaced again in 1998 as Selma Blair's mother in Debutante. Hal Delrich and Betsy Baker have disappeared off the map.<br /><br />It's a must-see film by any standards. Hard evidence that, even in the Hollywood-controlled machine, it's possible to take a shoestring budget and an incredibly stupid idea, work outside the gears, and produce one of film's enduring classics. **** ½classic horror film.

B00008H2LE|5.0|In my opinion ,I think this is better than Hybrid Theory.They can play their instruments better,Mike and Chester have improved in songwriting and vocal skills.So all in all,that equals a better album.Hybrid Theory's a classic,and this will be too.Best track to me is Faint.The intro to it rox.Best rapping on that song too.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I was waiting for this CD. All new songs that get better every time I listen to them. This CD compares well with all of the other alternative rock CDs I have. Sounds best with extremely high volume. I reccomend you buy this CD NOW!
0375414932|4.0|William Boyd's latest novel, ANY HUMAN HEART, focuses on the life of Logan Mountstuart --- a writer, friend, lover and world traveler. His fascinating story is revealed through daily journal entries; his personal day-to-day writings relate his movements, thoughts and whereabouts.<br />The journals begin with Mountstuart's boyhood in Uruguay and then move to Oxford and the publication of his first book. We next travel with him to Paris --- where he rubs shoulders with the likes of Hemingway, Picasso and Joyce --- and Spain, where he covers its civil war.<br />During World War II, Mountstuart becomes a naval intelligence officer and befriends the Duke and Duchess of Windsor (though this eventually turns sour). Following the war, he goes to New York as an art dealer, to Africa as a literature professor, to London and finally to France, where he lives out the rest of his days. All the while, we watch him grow up through his musings and his rich life, which is characterized by friends, family, drugs, lovers, artists, booze, military men, fiends and foes, happiness and sadness, triumphs and personal tragedies. It is, journal entry after entry, the entire makeup of a life fully lived.<br />Logan Mountstuart is like Forrest Gump in a way. He is able to meet some extraordinary people and be embroiled in a number of important events. But this does not happen because of a goal or a determination to get someplace --- he just happens to be there at the time. Oh! There's Virginia Woolf again. Oh! Jackson Pollack is a charlatan. The Duchess is vindictive! Poor Hemingway, why did he have to shoot himself? Boyd brings all of these people and events into sharp focus, using a fictional character that you swear is real.<br />Boyd does throw events and people at Mountstuart with a bit too much gusto at times. The writer thinks to himself: How can I make his life a little more interesting right now? The story is beginning to drag. Yes, okay, I'll ship him off to Nigeria during its CivilWar. Hmmm, the writer muses, what funny thing can happen to an old man who has traveled the world? Of course, have him fall in with some sort of terrorist cell.<br />All in all, however, ANY HUMAN HEART is an accomplished piece. It brings together those small, seemingly insignificant details of one's life (breakfasts, vacations, weather reports), puts them up against world events and shows how one's life slowly, perhaps imperceptibly, changes from one day to the next. I'm hungry so I'll end here. Perhaps I'll cook up some scallops and eat them outside. It's bright and sunny but a bit cold. I'll have to wear a hat.<br />   --- Reviewed by Jonathan Shipley

B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia is truly one of the greatest movies ever made. David Lean's epic tale follows T.E. Lawrence, a British officer sent to Arabia, who organizes the Arabian tribes to fight for their freedom against the Turks. This film has to be seen in widescreen to be fully appreciated. The grandiose scenes of the Arabian desert are spectacular, especially on this DVD.<br /> The performances in this movie are perfect. The all-star cast is led by Peter O'Toole as Lawrence with some other huge names backing him up. Also joining him are Alec Guiness, Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Quayle, Jack Hawkins, Jose Ferrer, Claude Rains, and Arthur Kennedy. All of them are very good with Shariff and Quinn the best as rival leaders who join together thanks to O'Toole's Lawrence. The 2-disc set is well worth the price. Plenty of worthwhile extras as well as the widescreen presentation. Also check out the movie soundtrack, it should not be missed. A true epic that should not be missed by movie fans.
0316096199|5.0|It took a great deal of courage for Sebold to write this memoir, which describes her brutal rape as a college student and the subsequent investigation and prosecution of the crime.  In spite of the incendiary nature of the crime, Sebold remains largely an objective and composed storyteller, describing events in a detached and methodical manner.  It's actually a very interesting true crime story that is hard to put down.  The quality of writing is excellent, too.  Overall, a very engrossing read.  Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\".
B000059TPN|4.0|The Rock is an excellent action movie with a great cast and excellent action sequences.  A rogue general and his squad of renegade Marines have taken 81 hostages on Alcatraz and is threatening to fire rockets armed with VX gas into the Bay area if their demands are not met.  The general, Frank Hummel, wants $100 million for recognition of what his men have done for the US over the past thirty years.  Not willing to give him the money, the FBI sends in a Navy Seal team to try and take down all the rockets before they can be fired.  Along with them are a chemical weapons expert and the only man to ever escape from the impregnable island fortress.  This is a very enjoyable movie with plenty of action.  The whole cast is very good with plenty of good roles for the supporting actors.  For a great action movie that never slows down from beginning to end, check out The Rock. <br /> Sean Connery stars as SAS agent, John Mason, the only man to ever successfully escape from Alcatraz.  His performance is very good with plenty of great one-liners.  Nicolas Cage is equally as good as Stanley Goodspeed, the chemical weapons expert who must try to disarm the rockets.  Ed Harris turns in an excellent performance as rogue General Hummel, who eventually begins to question what he is doing.  The excellent supporting cast is great as well with plenty of notables giving good parts.  The Criterion Collection has an impressive list of extras added on.  Rather than going through them all, I'll just say that if you like the movie, you'll like the DVD.  For an excellent action movie with great cast and even better action, check out The Rock!
0151008116|5.0|This is an excellent book about religion, mysticism, hope, adventure, and survival.  After a shipwreck, the lead character, Pi, finds himself adrift on the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat filled with unusual animals.  I suppose the first obvious parallel is with Noah from the bible, though I'm not sure the author was aiming for such a simplistic interpretation.  With all the time adrift on the ocean, both the reader and the author have ample time to consider both the mundane and the mystical.  The quality of writing is superb and the story moves with excellent pace.  Overall, a wonderful book that nearly everyone will enjoy.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Resse witherspoon gives the performance of her life in this film.Shes funny beautifull clever(sometimes) and well blonde its gives us blondes more respect and i completley agree with the film blondes are not always dumb! my name being elle woods as well is rather strange to grasp however i dont think im much like her.the film is smart funny comedy at its best i laugh from start to end roll on the sequel!

B000060P79|5.0|At first, I heard the song 'addicted' and i was like 'hmmm. thats a good song' and then i deceided to check out what other songs were on their cd. i downloaded 'i'm just a kid' and it was an awesome song, and i wanted to hear more. i got the cd and its great. one of the songs that stands out to me the most is &quot;perfect,&quot; and this isnt a very punk/rock type sound, its more serious and sad. it's about pierre's relationship with his father. it's a very sad song, and personal and more power to pierre for voicing what hes feeling and on top of that he made a great song. here's some of the lyrics: <BR>&quot;And now I try hard to make it<BR>I just want to make you proud <BR>I'm never gonna be good enough for you <BR>I can't pretend that I'm alright <BR>And you can't change me&quot; <BR>just from these lyrics you can see that theres a lot of heart in pierre and his songs. these aren't all songs like what you might expect to hear from this punk band. i encourage everyone to give it a try because you might be pleasently surprised. thanks for reading =)
034537410X|5.0|I have to admit this is the best book for the price on the market with scientific proof and probability of occurences for lucid dreaming.  I have been trying months to have out of body experiences/partial dream ones and/or lucid dreaming and have to admit this book is very detailed explained and I have accomplished it with this book which many other books failed.  I have looked at other books on awareness exercises, this one even talks about it in depth more and not to mention the WILD/MILD techniques are worth the price alone cause I had a lucid experience with those tehchniques atleast once every second day after reading their FAQ, I had to buy the book to support this author and found out there are many more treasures/techniques in this book which I can't wait to try out.  This is my second best book on the market I will cherish and come back to many times, the other one is power of the subconscious mind by murphy, two of my favorite psychology books.
B000002JSJ|4.0|While not in the same league as previous classics this is still a<BR>great album that was sadly delegated to record store bargain bins soon after its release. Achilles, Nobody's Fault, and Tea For One are classics of the mighty Zep as good as anything they've ever done. The remaining tracks range from good to average.
B000001A3H|5.0|Definatly their magnum opus, Blues for the Red Sun is a very powerful hard rocking album, and it's definatly the best Stoner Rock album ever! Get this, then get Sky Valley and And the Circus... Their three best, but this tops them all.
B000002N1E|5.0|I own six or seven CDs by Prince, this one is I think the best. One notch above &quot;Symbol&quot; (also very good), at level with &quot;Parade&quot; (I think this CD is really special), definitely better than &quot;Chaos and Disorder&quot; and &quot;Come&quot; (mediocre in my opinion).
B00008H2LE|4.0|This has gotta be one of the best CDs this year, but coming from an outstanding band like Linkin Park, that's not too surprising.  I did like how they mixed some strings into \\"Faint\\" and a flute track in \\"Nobody's Listening.\\"  It shows that they can mix more classical elements with their cutting-edge sound.<br />Mr. Hahn again has a track to show his talent, \\"Session\\", and it is very impressive (possibly better than \\"Cure for the Itch\\").  Also, Chester's \\"Breaking the Habit\\" is an incredible fast-paced ballad that rivals \\"My December.\\"  Plus, Mike's rhymes on \\"Nobody's Listening\\" are amazing.  The only problem musically is that, despite the obvious talent of the other musicians, they never really get a chance to exhibit their musicianship like Mr. Hahn does.<br />Their most notable musical achievement is \\"From the Inside.\\"  It is written in a 6/8 time signature, yet the song doesn't seem ackward when compared to the other songs it accompies.  It still maintains a head-banging beat and has some well-adapted vocals from both Chester and Mike.  <br />Though it is a very well-written and performed CD (and I do give them extra credit for writing every part of every song themselves), it still seems like a band like Linkin Park can do better.  It may be a little demanding for a band has new on the major music scene as LP, but in the two and a half years since Hybrid Theory (I won't count the Reanimation CD, since that disappointingly only involved three of the band's members in its creation), they easily could have written more than 36 minutes of great music.  <br />By the way, it's worth buying the Limited Edition package, because the DVD's content is superb and, considering the  difference in price, is a steal.<br />So, despite its shortness, this album is well-worth your money and listening time.  It's a refreshing demonstration that, despite the rampant commercialism in the music market today, some select bands are still writing and producing great music.
B000069AUI|5.0|I absolutely love this album. One of the best of 2002. Painfully beautiful lyrics, beautifully arranged music. A must have for anyone who is serious about their music.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Overview<BR>The rhythm, the mysterious innuendos and thought provoking alchemy, all things well known about Britain's legendary rock band, Pink Floyd.  A band with a massive underground following of society's greatest minds and underminds alike, Pink Floyd has made a name for itself, and a style of its own.  Dark Side of the Moon tells the story of madness in musical commercialism, and the growing distance between the fictional entity &quot;Pink&quot; from the world.  Even having a grip on the premise of the album, rarely anyone can truly have a grasp what each and every song means, considering the elusive style of lyricist/bassist Roger Waters, one who has been known to write music with meanings deeper than that which is held amongst the general audience.  DSotM also touches on themes such as racial inequality, war, and personal reflections of seeing that life has passed you bye as &quot;no one told you when to run, you've missed the starting gun.&quot;  This album also shows Pink Floyd at its spiritual best as exhibited in the vocal presentation of &quot;The Great Gig In the Sky&quot; (Formerly known as &quot;Religion&quot;), a verbal expulsion of heart and feeling by one of the various women who've accompanied Floyd throughout their musical tenure.  Songs like &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot; touch on the absurdity of the industry's worship of money, and the turmoil caused by the separation of peoples by ideas and color.  The album ends in a grand crescendo as Pink begins to lose mental stability with such impacting songs as Eclipse, Brain Damage and Any Colour You Like.  I strongly suggest you join the millions of people who've found great luck in aquiring this atmospheric masterpiece.<br />Quality<BR>The quality of this SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc) is phenominal.  I'm an avid collector and fanatic of Pink Floyd and purchased this disc, comparing it to the already digitally remastered disc that accompanied the box-set Shine On, which was releasedin 1992, and discovered a complete difference in the sound quality.  The audio in the disc released in '92 shows signs of aging technology, and as any new sound is introduced into the audible mixture of sounds a previously introduced sound is either drowned or weakened in impact.  The '03 edition is more balanced, and the digital work on this disc is far more superior and every sound present in the recording is displayed in vibrant, clear, and biting precision.  The grand production of this SACD promotes the use of a SACD formatted player (SACDs run 60 times faster than standard audio) or a common CD player, and boasts the functionality of 5.1 stereo surround sound.<br />Overall Rating<BR>5/5
B00008H2LB|5.0|great cd overall..i bought it on tuesday and i havent stop listening to it or taken out of my cd player. i always linkin park and enjoy their music, but i think this album is one of their greatest. mike and chester's voices blend together perfectly. i absoulty love breaking the habit, faint, nobody'<BR>s listening and numb. acutally i like all the songs! i havent skip a track at all. <BR>its a must buy!

B00005LMBK|4.0|I don't really listen to techno but this i do, and i love this album. They are very talented. I love their videoclips and who ever designed them is a good cartoon designist. Any way great album, funny lyrics. Its pretty cool how they do all types of music like rap, rock and techno, though overall this is techno. The rap tracks on this album are clint eastwood, a slow vicious rap song, and then you have rock the house, a nice smoothe rap song. My favourite song is 19/2000 which is a cool song and one of the hit singles as well as clint eastwood. When i said 19/2000, i don't mean the fast version i mean the slow version. The slow version is better in my opinion. I also like the song dracula which is a slow slow song song with a spooky kinda feel to it. My favourite band member would propbably have to be noodle or 2D. Any way all in all go get this album. They are seriously the best techno band out there. The reason why i gave it 4 stars is because there where a couple of pointless songs but any way go get this album.
038572179X|1.0|The beginning of the book had me hoping that it would actually live up to the hype, but no. It was simply irritating to read such a silly story. I will certainly not trust the online reviews any more when choosing a book. Bad book. Do not read!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I like this cd because when I listen to it the music relaxes me.  It puts you in a mellow mood. My favorite tracks are: Come Away With Me, Turn Me On, Shoot the Moon, and The Long Day is Over.  The others are good, but this ones really stand out to me. Norah's voice is really great.  She never oversings or screams in the songs, If you want music that is soothing, but this cd.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This album is an insperation to me. I can play all the songs on the cd and i think im a little ubsest. Nirvana made me starting to like music, i got \\"nevermind\\" when i was like, 4, other kids were singing thier abc's and i was singing along to smells like teen spirit. nothing can kill the music they play, i go to a Christian skool but i still where my nirvana shirt every day and every day they make me change my shirt, but i have a point to this. This album has a collection of my favorite nirvana songs, each song is the best of the album, each song makes me want to become a lead guitarest. Watch for my album coming out, were the \\"black and white flamingo's\\" ya i know its a stupid name but it has a catch to it. We sound like nirvana. in memory of kurt cobain              ~cody
0345360338|5.0|Part 2 of the Welsh trilogy, but there is not so much about Wales this time, Llewelyn  & Davydd are characters that stay mostly in the background.  The main character is  Simon de Montfort, a French born nobleman who led a rebellion in England seeking to limit the rights of the king.  Each book of the series can be taken on its own, it's unnecessary to have read Book 1 to appreciate \\"Falls the Shadow\\".  There is less \\"romance\\" in this one compared to Penman's other novels and more focus on actual historical events, as usual a tremendous amount of historical research has gone into the writing.  She has a real talent for making characters from history seem like living, breathing human beings for the modern reader.<br />The story opens in 1231 with a young Simon arriving in Brittany where he persuades a cousin of his to grant him the Earldom of Leicester.  Several years later he persuades the sister of King Henry of England to marry him.  He holds true to principles ahead of his time, and ends up in one struggle after another with the king, easily overpowering weak & pitiful Henry, his brother-in-law the  king.  Of course, Simon is eventually brought down,  by both the ineptitude of his own sons as military men and the strength of Edward's army.  The last scene in this installment is set in 1267 after the slaughter at Evesham, the storyline is pointing in the direction of Wales once again.<br />So many great scenes - the citizens of London throwing refuse at the Queen on her barge, Gruffydd plunging to his death,  and  the decadent army camp outside the safe walls of Kenilworth castle are unforgettable to name a few.

B000089RVX|5.0|This band is amazing.  From the first time I heard Evanescence on the Daredevil soundtrack, I was hooked.  I can't believe how touching their lyrics are.  Amy Lee has an amazing voice, and the whole aura of the band is so dark and brooding (the rich guitar riffs add well to this), yet light and beautiful (courtesy of Amy's voice).  This band is destined for stardom.  What an amazing first album!
B00005CDNK|5.0|Ok, so Arrival is probably ABBA's best albumn for its absolute brilliance, but The Visitors is definately #2.  What is so incredible about the Visitors is it one of those truly great albums which does nothing for you on first listen, but by listen 4 or 5 it effects you on a much deeper level.  ABBA is a bit of a strange situation for me.  My parents wore out Greatest Hits volumes 1 and 2 (before that ABBA GOLD stuff) when I was a kid - so every song on those albums is engrained in me down to the genetic level.  The thing is, I don't remember anything off of the Visitors - so this album completely stands on its own for me.  It is something much more than just catchy songs.  I will argue with anyone that ABBA is second only to the Beatles as the greatest pop group ever.  If Arrival is their Sgt. Pepper, The Visitors is their White Album.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin parks meteora is by far one of the best cd's they have yet to produce. Meteora has all the elements that hybrid theory had and also throws in some of the musical genuis that was accompanied with Reanimation.

B000002LHT|3.0|The Ramones made a semi-metal album in \\"Brain Drain,\\" and it really didn't suit the band all that well. Dee Dee's bass is buried under thunder drums and slabbish guitars, distorting the bands' sound into something that would be considered (for 1989, anyway) more album radio friendly. You'll find a few good numbers here; the Dee Dee sung \\"Punishment Fits The Crime,\\" Joey's love sick \\"Come Back Baby,\\" and the anthemic \\"Merry Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight Tonight).\\" It just hurts that there are only two excellent songs here, \\"I Believe In Miracles\\" and the marvelous \\"Pet Semetary\\" (which long-time fan Stephen King requested for the film version of his book). Even the mandatory cover (\\"Palisades Park\\") sounds out of synch. The \\"Mondo Bizaro\\" follow-up album would see the band return to their roots, but \\"Brain Drain\\" was just The Ramones trying too hard to sound current.
0345347951|5.0|Their are so many novels (even those written in 2002) that are obviously inspired by this protean novel.  Although Clarke is often viewed as a &quot;hard&quot; SF writer, this novel is fundamentally a sci-theological fantasy but by providing a perspective of these events from the point of view of a science observer, these fantastic developments are palatable even to hard SF fans. Most of all, its an entertaining read.
B000003BQW|4.0|Three albums had passed since the last great Ramones album, and even the faithful were getting worried. The Ramones' long time relationship with Sire had ended and they entered the studio with a new label and a strong sense of purpose. The result was a return to form, and set the band back on course for a resurgence. Starting with the anti-PMRC (remember them?) rant &quot;Censors#!t&quot;, they crash through 13 very Ramonesy songs in a style that would almost be retro if they hadn't had invented it in the first place.<br />Also worth a chuckle is the disc's closer, &quot;Touring.&quot; Ripping off their own &quot;Rock And Roll High School,&quot; Joey sends up the whole road show of rock with a wink and a power chord. It ends the disc on a note as giddy as the opener was politically snarling. &quot;Mondo Bizaro&quot; was The Ramones we had grown up loving, comfortable with their legacy and ready to take control of it once again.
0316666343|2.0|This book had so much potential. I was racing through it, tissue in hand. Then suddenly I felt that one evening while watching &quot;Ghost&quot; Ms. Sebold's editor called and said he needed the book. She hurriedly finished leaving out all the depth of her early writing. Susie's &quot;return to Earth&quot; was totally unnecessary, almost insulting, to the wonderful character that had been developed. The mother's acceptance back into the family felt tacked on as did George Harvey's fate. In short, I don't understand the huge success of this book.
B00006LPIV|5.0|This film is so stunning and indescribable! I have never known such joy and excitement watching a new release!<br />Isabelle Huppert is playing one of her best roles here. She is undeniably the best actress in the world.<BR>You just need to look at her face in this film to comprehend that. Yes, she never plays the role: she is the character, she lives the character, she feels the character.<BR>She is deeply moving in this role. A cold, reserved, distant woman, yet so vulnerable, so tormented!<br />The contrast between her face and her emotions is amazing, fascinating. <BR>Loneliness, despair, madness, anger, fear, pain, uncertainty, sadness...<BR>Her cruelty and indifference are amazing when she makes her students suffer, and her vulnerability and puerility are even more striking when it's her turn to suffer.<br />The best scene takes place in her bedroom, when she locks herself up with her beloved, handsome student, ignoring her poor mother who is spying outside.<br />She forces him to read a long letter, a letter that she has written and given him earlier, after the piano lesson.<BR>The absurd thing is that she insists on hearing the letter read to her, in which she describes what she expects him to do to her, in full details.<BR>What a more horrible thing to request from a young man you love!<BR>First, he seems embarrassed, surprised, amused. He reads it mockingly as she watches his face inquisitively, intensely, like a child hearing a story for the first time. <BR>He cannot believe what he's reading, the innocent young student.<BR>No, he refuses to believe her sickening requests. She wants him to humiliate her, to degrade her, to be cruel, to torture, to hurt, strike, rape.<BR>He cannot believe it. No, no, his beautiful and respectful teacher would not want such a thing. Besides, he loves her too much to hurt her. He shakes his head, bewildered. To prove that she is not joking, she pulls out her 'torture' tools from under her bed. She shows them to him, proudlyand naively, and assures him she is serious.<BR>As he reads further, he is shocked, angry, disappointed, disgusted, and walks out of her apartment rapidly.<BR>Although there is no violence nor sex in this scene, the impact is heartbreaking, and leaves you breathless. <br />The absurdity, the tension, the intimacy, the gaze, the provocation, allow you to imagine what might happen to her if he obeys her order, something even more frightening, more sadistic, more violent, more erotic, more painful, than the reality itself.<br />It's based on the controversial novel by Elfriede Jelinek, an Austrian writer. The book is even more powerful than the film. If you love the film, you absolutely have to read the book. It's like seeing the film again, and still, the impact is tremendous. There's more in-depth analysis of the characters with a striking style from the author. <BR>The philosophical and psychological observations, the wild images are so detailed, so vivid, so absurd, so sarcastic that they make you cry and laugh at the same time.<BR>It is a passionate book and a frightening one. All the strongest emotions are in here, with beautiful classical piano for music lovers.<br />Classical music lovers might not agree on the beauty of this book. Classical music is supposed to elevate our mortal souls, isn't it? But here it degrades the musician's soul. How can we tolerate such a thing?<BR>Yes, it degrades here, but it's how reality is. Classical music creates the strongest human emotions, and why not torment, suffering, degradation, the passion and pleasure of hurting and being hurt?
B00008977N|3.0|I'm a fan of Peter Gabriel's from way back.  I bought this DVD excited to be able to see a concert I wasn't fortunate enough to attend in person.<br />While I find the concert to look like a great one, the sound is absolutely horrible.  Without using technical terms to describe the sonic attrocities here, I'll simply say that it sounds like someone is playing with the volume control.  The volume is contantly changing and not by small amounts.  Some of the tunes sound like they're fading out shortly after they begin.<br />Makes me wonder if Peter Gabriel listened to the DVD before approving the release.  If not, whoever did the final audio approval should not be hired again as it sounds like they didn't even bothered to listen.  And this is touted on the package as being re-mastered for this disk.  <br />Had I rented this prior to purchase, I don't think I would have bought it.  If I didn't like the concert part so much, I might even return the disk as defective, which the audio portion certainly is.
0736041850|3.0|The information on the muscles is incredibly useful, and the drawings really are very well done.  And yet the male models are so grotesquely unlike human beings that the entire document serves as an indictment of body building.  The pictures demonstrate that the real focus of this book is not strength training, but body building - two pursuits that use related exercises, but have different goals.  The male models didn't have to look like people who have no life outside the gym.  They didn't have to look like the products of anabolic steroid abuse.  We know that because the images of women are of people who are very strong, but still attractive within the limits of ordinary appearance.  Using male models who are body builders, rather than just guys who lift seriously does nothing to make the exercises clearer - it just serves as a bad example to folks who are susceptible to the self-serving advertising of unhealthy freaks.  This book  would have been an awful lot better for study and demonstration if it had not carried along with the useful information  an enormous load of misinformation about human bodies that contributes to unrealistic ideas about appearance, possibility, and health.<br />mhh
B00006CXXU|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I was not a Christina lover.  I got this CD because I liked 'Dirrty'.  The CD certainly suprised me.  I love almost every song.  She has such a variety of material on this record.  I love her vocals; she has one of the best voices out there.  You can tell that she put her heart and soul into this one, as cheesy as that may sound.  This is one of the few CD's that I can stick in and just press play.
B00005JLK1|2.0|I've seen this movie before - it was called Event Horizon.  And that was not too good either.<BR>If you draw out the plot and character lines via pencil and graph you see that the lines for both movies are identical.  The beginning is still too disturbing to recall but does not really serve the story.  And the later scenes of the massacre on board, in light of world events, is unfortunate.
B00003CX8J|4.0|When the announcement came that a film was going to be made about the X-Men, after Marvel sold the rights, I wasn't too happy with the news. Previous films based on comic books did not do that well. Judge Dread and Spawn are just two examples. I didn't expect much from the film but when I heard that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen where going to play two of the main characters I was lifted and I thought the film might not be so bad after all.<BR> <BR>When I went to see this at the cinema I was surprised with the film in whole and with individual items. In whole the plot of the film is good and the way the film unfolds as to who Magneto (Ian McKellen) really wants is done in such a way as to mislead you to who he really wants until the X-Men finally find out what his intentions are. Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) is played very well and the fear that he, and many others, feel about mutants. The argument that takes place near the beginning of the film with Dr Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is very well directed and the argument is a valid one as well, making good points and the points being made all making sense. <BR>In the individual parts of the film the characters stay true to there characters in the comic books apart from the fact that the X-Men now wear uniforms instead of \\"yellow spandex!\\" The actors are well chosen and seeing as though I haven't seen many of the actors in any other films they really did bring the characters themselves come to life. Rebecca Romijn- Stamos who played Mystique had to spend 10 hours in make-up just to look the part! Everything that takes place in the film that is related to the X-Men stay true to the comic. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), better know as Professor X has a school set up for \\"gifted\\" people where other mutants teach them how to control their powers and also get a education while being in a safe environment. Professor X himself being a mutant who broke his back and is now confined to a wheelchair. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is one of the most favourite characters out of the X-Men (not forgetting Cyclops (James Marsden) and his character features a lot in the film. His past is unknown and the reason why he has a super strong metal, known as adamantium, which gives him the ability to extend and retract steel claws from between his knuckles is implanted though out his body is a mystery and leaves the story open for a sequel..... <BR>All the actors who played all the main characters in the film also deserve praise as they played the characters well and they did truly represent the characters from the comic book. <br />The DVD of the X-men includes a number of \\"extras\\" as well as the original and an extended version. Don't expect much from the extended version of the X-Men as it is not a complete individual film itself. It takes the original film and when extra pieces of the film, that were removed or deleted from the film for a number of reasons, are just inserted into the film. This means that you get a rough version where you sometimes have to watch parts of the film that doesn't really fit in well or have to watch the same part of the film twice but with different scripts. I suggest you watch the original version first before you watch the extended version so you don't get confused. The DVD also includes interviews with the Bryan Singer who directed the film, the screen test for Wolverine (why!?!), all the adverts from the USA and the UK that appeared on the TV advertising the film at the cinema, the advert for the soundtrack, the animation test for two parts of the film, a gallery section (and for those who have a Playstation 2 you will need a hand control to view these) and a little section called \\"Mutant Watch\\" <BR>Mutant Watch is really good. It is about 20 minutes long and it shows an separate version of the court case where Senator Kelly argues his case about mutants and has video evidence which are parts of the film. This section is acted out specifically for DVD and it is a clever way to advertise the X-Men film while also explaining some parts of the film to those who don't know, don't understand or are unfamiliar with the X-Men world. <br />Anyway this film is good for die hard fans or new comers and it is a DVD I strongly suggest you buy or at least rent.
B00008H2LE|5.0|In a time were music manufactured Florida music agencies and dismal mtv merchandised groups and idols rule the airwaves, it's great to still see some bands refuse to be mainstream sell-outs on their second album. Though Meteroa, doesnt have the same taste of Thybird, the sound and lyrics are still pure which makes it a great follow up album. Songs such as &quot;Numb&quot; &quot;Easier to Run&quot; are remenisance of Thybird though a new flavor is definitely heard in songs like &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;. And if Re-animation showed us anything, everyone will be awaiting the remix album anxiously. Really wanna know how good this album is - Most people I know who have access to a pirated copy are still going to the stores to get an original copy just to support the band - That's how good it is.
B000001IQH|1.0|this album is a style parody album,just like wierd al except not meant to be funny although wierd al isn't funny either i sense it was meant to be.they have mohawks, rude voices and call themselves rancid.they are a punk rock theme park.just as eric clapton stole the blues from the black southern man so has rancid stolen the style of the anti social white man.in fact they did this to be part of a society called PUNK which makes them hypocrites because punk is about freedom not following guidlines like be rude and get a mohawk.rancid shops at hot topic.the music is well produced and takes skill to play however it is not genuine unless they are genuinely ingenuine.this is not self expression it is self importance therefore i do not consider it to be art.this band is like a gang of overimposing unrealistic out of style darth vaders with mohawks.punk or die.maybe if they believed in themselves on a deeper level they could come over to the good side of the force but for now they will continue to be punk rock vader nazis.

B00008H2LE|4.0|Overall, this muchly anticipated CD is decent, with a few songs that make you remember how much you like listening to Linkin Park, however, there are parts that make this CD not as great as it could be.<BR>1 Foward: 13 seconds of rain falling???<br />2 Don't Stay: A good song, a good one to start with, nice heavy beat with good lyrics as well 4/5<br />3 Somewhere I Belong: The CD's first single, maybe the best song on the album, sounds like old Linkin Park, very heavy 5/5<br />4 Lying from you: not a very good song, the lyrics are lacking and it's not as heavy as the rest of the song, Shinoda's rapping keeps it from being the worst song on the album 1/5<br />5 Hit the Floor: Fun beat, it's basically Shinoda rapping and Bennington screaming, like old Linkin Park, not a bad song though 3/5<br />6 Easier to Run: A ballad, the lyrics are ok but the music is not very catchy, I usually skip this song 2/5<br />7 Faint: A very fast song, contrary to the song before it, the rapping is good, and it is pretty heavy, good song, but not the best 4/5<br />8 Figure .09: A good heavy song, nothing spectacular though, but it's one of the best on the CD 4/5<br />9 Breaking the Habit: A weird song, almost a techno-ballad, it's not very good, Bennington is better at yelling than singing so I usually skip this song 2/5<br />10 From the Inside: Very heavy, good lyrics, a decent song 3/5<br />11 Nobody's Listening: Another weird one, however this one is very fun to listen to, Shinoda's rapping with the &quot;japanese style&quot; flute sound in the backgroud makes this song my favorite on the album 5/5<br />12 Session: A sequel to Hybrid Theory's &quot;A cure for the itch&quot;, it is a good techno song 4/5<br />13 Numb: Another ballad, not a good one either, great chorus though 3/5<br />Departing a lot from their old CD sounds, they make another good one but perhaps the ballads were a bit too much. Anyway, it is a good CD overall and you should pick it up and decide for yourselves.

B000021XR5|5.0|i'd give any stp album 10 stars if i could. the reason for this album so great is the fact that it was rushed. why is that a good thing? b/c it brings what the songs were originally supposed to sound like, instead of souping it up into some studio remix crap that just screws it all up.<br />unlike other stp albums, no. 4 is quite frankly the best album to rock to. most of the songs are fast, uptempo rockfest anthems. exceptions are sour girl, atlanta, and i got you. those 3 songs give this album even more greatness b/c it varies the album. stp will go down as one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
0066214122|5.0|I never thought Michael Crichton could write a book that was better than Jurassic Park.  He has accomplished this feat with this novel.  It is a book that is imnpossible to put down.  It not only makes you think of what technology is out there, but also how it is being used and monitored.  His best book yet.
0515123447|5.0|I enjoy Lee Child's writing style and I appreciated his unconventional hero, a guy who is true to his upbringing and training and doesn't waste time moralizing or wallowing in self-doubt.  This book is a page turner, I stayed up way past midnight reading it and only reason I put it down is because I couldn't focus any longer on the page.  I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; books.  This book is for you if you've also enjoyed the following:  Bourne Identity, Without Remorse, Point of Impact (and all Bob Lee Swagger stories), J. Maxim's Bannerman series, Daniel Silva's Gabrial Allon, or Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series.
0553212443|5.0|It's hard to think of a literary work that has been filmed and staged in more imaginative variations than Charles Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;--there's the excellent George C. Scott version, the delightful Muppet version, the charming Mr. Magoo version, etc., etc. But ultimately true &quot;Carol&quot; lovers should go back to Dickens' original text, which remains a great read.<br />&quot;Carol&quot; tells the story of cold-hearted miser Ebenezer Scrooge, who despises the Christmas holiday and scorns all who celebrate it. But a visit from a series of supernatural beings forces him to reevaluate his attitude--and his life.<br />With this simple plot Dickens has created one of the enduring triumphs of world literature. It's a robust mix of humor, horror, and (most of all) hope, all leavened with a healthy dash of progressive social criticism. One thing I love about this book is that while it has a focus on a Christian holiday, Dickens puts forth a message that is truly universal; I can imagine this story resonating with people of any religious background, and also with more secular-oriented people.<br />This is a tale of greed, selfishness, regret, redemption, family, and community, and is enlivened by some of the most memorable characters ever created for English literature. Even if Dickens had never written another word, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; would still have, I believe, secured his place as one of the great figures of world literature.
1558807381|5.0|Behold, Ridley Scott's last great \\"Ridley Scott\\" movie until the release of \\"Gladiator\\"! This was the movie that gave Mia Sara her first film role, that gave Tim Curry his best film role to date, and, for my money, has to be one of the best art directed films EVER! This is a movie that peeks right into a 6 year old's mind and makes a record of what he or she is dreaming about right after being read a British fairy tale/bedtime story.<br /><br />(( I )) used to have dreams like this! In fact, I distinctly remember an image very similar to \\"The Great Tree\\" in one of my unit aged visits to the realm of the sandman.<br /><br />One of the most amazing facts about this amazing movie is that all of it, including what appear to be outdoor shots filmed in a very idyllic meadow, was filmed on a large sound stage! Another amazing fact is that Siskel and Ebert, again showing all the judgment of Wrong-Way Corrigan, panned this movie as one of the ten WORST films of 1986!! Roger Ebert STILL maintains that it's one of Tom Cruise's worst movies. Please, Roger....buy a clue! This is a film every participant in it, from Scott himself down to the late Billy Barty, could point to with pride.<br /><br />It was an auspicious first film for Mia Sara, who is excellent as the very feminine and charming Lily, and a very good feather in the cap of the then not-so-famous Cruise. But the truly amazing role is that of the devilish Darkness, parlayed by an unrecognizable Tim Curry, who, beside being expertly layered in makeup, (except for those slightly wobbly horns,) has his voice electronically altered to fully become the ominous Lord of the Underworld, who wants nothing more than to plunge the world into eternal night.<br /><br />Tom Cruise, however, is the one who seems out of place here. I mean, this is a guy who made his early name portraying Harry High School types in films like \\"Risky Business\\" and \\"All The Right Moves\\" and who still had a few college age numbers in him after this one. He seemed cast WAY against type, and is just barely tolerable as a Peter Pan/Mowgli type fellow, named Jack O' The Green, who communes with nature. This is still, nevertheless, a movie he should have never been in.<br /><br />Mia Sara, on the other hand, is perfect for the role of gentle Lily, a princess who supposedly loves the Cruise character. Though she hails from Brooklyn, New York,(!) she affects a very convincing neo-British accent and projects a very ladylike vibe in this role. Sad fact of this young lady's career is, after co-starring in the very appealing film \\"Ferris Beuller's Day Off\\" following this one, her career went downhill after a series of expensive TV movies and mini-series, after which she lept back into features that sank completely into obscurity almost the minute they were released. About her only claim to fame now is having Sean Connery for an ex-father-in-law.<br /><br />The talented young David Bennent, who had already been in the movie version of Gunther Grass' \\"The Tin Drum\\" as Max the Dwarf, portrays King of the Elves, Honeythorn Gump here. The little fellah's acting chops are amazing, for he can't be much older than 15 here, and he carries himself like a pro, getting into the part as well as any Method Acting legend you can name.<br /><br />Remember those old Alka-Seltzer commercials from the seventies? Specifically the \\"Marshmallowed meatballs\\" classic with Terry Kaiser? Well, the GIRL in that one, Alice Playten, portrays a particularly mischievious goblin named Blix in this movie. She is on a par with Curry and Sara in her portrayal of this MALE character. Her makeup, as well as that of Pox, her companion, is as good as Curry's.<br /><br />The mood, look and acting in this movie is top-notch...it has few visual betters, and it is a excellent example of the visual mastery that Ridley Scott wielded in the first half of his career. Buy this movie, and I guarantee you it will become your childrens' favorite flick, and will probably find aplace in your OWN personal top twenty as well!
B00003XB8K|5.0|Enigma's fourth album \\"the screen behind the mirror\\" brings full circle the musical journey the project started in 1990 on the project's first groundbreaking album \\"MCMXC a.d.\\" Personally I was less excited with Enigma with each successive album and originally did not pick up this album out of lack of interest. However I finally saw the video to the \\"gravity of love\\" which forced me to run out and get the album. i have been amazed since. This album continues the dark tones of earlier ENigma work but is not a retread of previous material. Fans obviously have this album but for those on the fence or with a slight interest DONT HESITATE!! This album has beautiful flowing music mixed with Enigma's trademark gregorian chants as well as ethnic samples and sexy vocals. The perfect album to relax or dream to.
B00005JKG7|4.0|THE FOG     (USA - 1979)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)  Theatrical soundtrack: Mono    While celebrating its centenary birthday, a small Californian coastal town is visited by a ghostly fog containing an army of murderous spirits who take revenge for a terrible injustice.    Released on a wave of expectation following the worldwide success of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN (1978), THE FOG surprised everyone by underperforming at the US box-office. Which is a shame, because it's arguably the better of the two films. Beautifully photographed in widescreen Panavision by Carpenter stalwart Dean Cundey (who went on to Hollywood glory with the likes of BACK TO THE FUTURE, JURASSIC PARK and APOLLO 13), this unassuming 'ghost story' opens on a lonely clifftop at midnight, where a crusty old sea dog (John Houseman) tells an audience of wide-eyed children how their home town was built on the foundations of tragedy. As with HALLOWEEN, the pace is slow but steady, and Carpenter judges the shocks and scares with consummate ease, and there's a relentless accumulation of details which belies the script's modest ambitions.     Jamie Lee Curtis headlines the movie opposite her real life mother Janet Leigh, though Hal Holbrook takes the acting honors as a frightened priest who realizes the town was founded on deception and murder. As the fog rolls in, the narrative reaches an apocalyptic crescendo, as most of the major players find themselves besieged by zombie-like phantoms inside an antiquated church, in scenes reminiscent of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Scary stuff, to be sure, though Carpenter was forced to add new material during post-production in an effort to 'beef up' the movie's horror quotient, including a memorable late-night encounter between a fishing boat and the occupants of a ghostly schooner which looms out of the swirling fog (similar scenes would be added to HALLOWEEN II [1981] for the same reasons, though under less agreeable circumstances). Production values are rock solid, and Carpenter cranks up the tension throughout, resulting in a small masterpiece of American Gothic. Recommended, though nervous viewers are advised that this one is genuinely frightening in places.
0790725657|5.0|What I great movie directed by the mexican Antonio Cuarn, the photography is remarcable, this movie is about values, courage and hope, great film that should take out the best of everyone!
0790729628|4.0|There is some debate over which version of BR is the \\"best\\".  The original theatrical and videocassette releases contain  the voice-over narration and the \\"feel good\\" ending, plus  extra violence scenes - all of which are gone from the   director's cut version. The film's creators, the actors,  and,(from what I can gather)most fans of the film hated the  narration and the ending because they were imposed on   Ridley Scott by the studio after test audiences had trouble  following the plot, and after control of the film had been   contractually taken away from Scott after budget overruns.   Thus, an otherwise great film had   supposedly been adulterated by non-artistic interlopers intent  on dumbing-down the film to increase it's appeal to the   great unwashed masses (and their wallets).  In the specific case of Blade Runner, I feel the studio execs  actually improved my enjoyment of the film. When I saw the   original release in '82, the dreamy Vangelis score, the excellent  visuals of a dark and dying Los Angeles, not to mention the   graphic violence, conspired to alternately seduce and distract  me constantly. The voice-over narration provided the viewpoint  \\"above it all\\" that called me back to the plot after being led  off by the texture and power of the production design and the  menace of the fugitive replicants. The famous death scene  where the replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)comes to   his preprogrammed end, is one of the great moments in ALL of   science fiction - and the point at which anyone unclear on the  meaning of the film will be straightened out. Another great and  powerful moment, is when Deckard callously informs Rachel   (Sean Young)that her memories are not her own - they are implanted  copies of Tyrell's niece's. An immense wave of silent devastation   plays across Rachel's normally stoic face - perhaps the finest   moment of Young's career.     But the voice-over version IS the one that put BR on the map   - and has more charm. As for the unicorn sequences in the  director's cut, I don't need or want  Deckard to turn out to be a replicant. (Deckard's unicorn dreams  known to Gaff,who makes unicorn origami, because Gaff learns of   unicorn \\"implants\\" in replicant Deckard from Tyrell) I feel  that it's important to see a true human go thru an evolution  of awareness regarding engineered human life, not   another replicant.  In any other film it would be a  fascinating subject to explore, but in  the context of the rest of BR, awkward. That would mean the  whole movie is about a high-order replicant (Batty) teaching a   low-order replicant (Deckard) what it is to be synthetic. Well,  that's a cool idea, but to have it descend on us in the last   5 minutes, after assuming Deckard is human the whole time,  and especially after Batty's dying words(written by Hauer),isn't  a thought-provoking shocker ending, but a needless confusion of  an otherwise perfectly wonderful lesson in the dangers of playing  God. We need a quality DVD, loaded with extras, that has both   versions.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Michael Jackson was always going to have trouble with a follow-up to his multi-Grammy award winning, record breaking, revolutionary and 50 million selling \\"Thriller\\" album. After all, it was the biggest selling record in history and spent a remarkable 37 weeks at No.1 on the US chart. So along came 1987, and with it, Michael's long-awaited follow up, \\"Bad.\\" It's a well-known fact that it wasn't as good as Thriller, but it's definitely still an excellent and classic record too - and 25 million sales prove it, even if this was only half of its predecessor. As with all Michael Jackson albums, \\"Bad\\" spawned a string of massive worldwide hits which topped the charts worldwide and set new trends, broke records and revolutionized the way the world listens to music. Bad contains an impressive eight singles that were released in the UK.<br /><br />Bad opens with the superb title track, \\"Bad.\\" As the second single to be taken from this album, the song peaked at No.3 in the UK and was another massive US No.1 for Michael in September 1987. The beat is heavy on this song, and the vocals from Michael are nasty - they really do give the sense of bad and evil. The verses are subdued, while the chorus is a full-on assault in which Michael proudly declares his 'badness,' perfectly built up with the bridge. \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is just an absolute classic. By far one of Michael's best ever songs, the song peaked at No.3 in the UK and was a US No.1 in December 1987. The deep and very tight bassline on this song is absolutely amazing, which runs the entire five minutes of the song. The way the song is arranged is just perfect, and Michael's voice is excellent as it rises and falls. \\"Speed Demon\\" is another excellent song, with a clunky beat that captures the imagination. The highlights include Michael's high-pitched vocals halfway through and the car engines revving up. \\"Liberian Girl\\" is one of the most laid-back and relaxing songs on Bad, yet it isn't really a mid-tempo song. Michael's subdued vocals are perfectly contrasted with the deep beat and the mysterious woman's foreign chant every so often. Not the best song, but still a good song overall.<br /><br />\\"Just Good Friends\\" is perhaps the worst song on Bad, despite it being rather good. It tries too much to rely on past songs from Michael's previous two albums, in which people speculate a romance over the two, so they publicly declare they are 'just good friends'. The formula worked well on previous albums, but fails here. \\"Another Part Of Me\\" is one of the best songs on the album, with its nasty and ear-catching beat. It was a very radio-friendly song, which only peaked at No.15 in the UK. \\"Man In The Mirror\\" was Michael's 10th US No.1 single, but charted at a disappointingly low No.21 in the UK. The message behind the song is that if you want to make a difference in the world you should start with yourself, and if you're not happy with yourself, you probably won't be bothered in making that difference. The song has a memorable chorus with a catchy hook, but the verse lacks this. \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is without a doubt one of Michael's best-ever songs. A UK and US No.1 hit single in August 1987, this remarkable mid-tempo ballad opens with spoken text by Michael, about how much he loves the lady in his life. The song then begins after around 37 seconds with a beautiful tune. The verses that follow have a catchy and smooth arrangement, and the chorus is amazing. Michael also shares the song with Siedah Garrett - her contribution to the song is equally thrilling.<br /><br />\\"Dirty Diana\\" is another absolute classic and a favourite amongst many fans. This is the perfect song to sum up the atmosphere of the album - dark and bad, but in a good way. The verses are rather slow and swaying, before the chorus jumps in with its heavy-rock chorus and Michael's screeching vocals. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is yet another amazing song. The song has a funky beat, with brilliant and flamboyant vocals, along with Michael's classic line \\"Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?\\" The video is legendary and features Michael pulling off some amazing moves in his white suit, and who could forget the scene where he throws a quarter in the club before it lands in the jukebox at the other side of the room? The final song on Bad is the extraordinary \\"Leave Me Alone.\\" Michael addresses all those critics who have only negative things to say about him. The song is rather different to anything Michael has every done, and works very well. The chorus has layered vocals which give it a perfect sound, while the beat is typical Jackson. The song was never released in the US, but peaked at No.2 in the UK in February 1989. Even more amazing is the video. It is mainly an animated video, with the media's perfect world which has destroyed Michael, but he gets up off the floor, taller than any building or mountain and starts ripping the place to bits.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Michael Jackson is one of the biggest selling male recording artists of all-time. His musical style has run all the way through society. From \\"Rock With You\\" to \\"You Rock My World\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\" to \\"Black And White,\\" Michael has always been there setting the trends, breaking records and literally ruling the world.

B00005JLZ9|5.0|This is a movie that requires patience and attention.  It twists back on itself much like memento or the usual suspects.  The plot is self-explanitory but the resulution is complex.  This was a great role fo travolta.  If you liked the complexity of the Usual Suspects you will love this movie.
0790729725|5.0|\\"As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.\\" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.<br />Gangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. \\"Goodfellas\\"--based on true events--exploits the life of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the mafia at a young age and continues his \\"career\\" throughout the film.<br />As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mafia boss Paul Sorvino; and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster, and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems. <br />Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to Henry starting to take and deal drugs, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.<br />\\"Goodfellas\\" is one of the best films I have ever seen. There really is no plot per say, as you can see above, other than following the true life story of a gangster. But what makes the film is a witty script, intelligent, deep, and for the most part likable characters; a great director, great actors; the list goes on.<br />Robert De Niro isn't in this movie a whole lot--I'd estimate an hour and a half out of the three or so hours the film is. But when he's on screen he gives a terrific performance.<br />Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in \\"Goodfellas,\\" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.<br />Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. \\"What do you want, ....\\" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.<br />Martin Scorsese, one of the most overlooked directors when it comes to Oscars and other such awards, beautifully directs this gangster epic; with some of his latest films being slight flops (\\"Gangs of New York\\"--I haven't seen it yet, but I heard it's average), I think another gangster film is in store for the future.<br />\\"Goodfellas\\" has got everything you go to the movies for: Witty dialogue, great, three-dimensional characters; excellent directing style, and some great actors. \\"Goodfellas\\" is an offer you can't refuse.<br />By the way, I think it is appropriate to put a bit of a disclaimer on this review: I would not recommend \\"Goodfellas\\" to those that have a problem with violence and/or language, and \\"Goodfellas\\" is definitely not one for your kids to watch--it contains extremely strong, pervasive language, and a great deal of strong, realistic violence. I only put this because I am sick of parents taking children to see R-rated films that are not appropriate for children. And this is definitely one of them. <br />Anyway, \\"Goodfellas\\" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen.<br />5/5 Stars -
B00005JKZT|5.0|The purists may rise up in revolt and curse Mr. Jackson, but all I can say (as every film student beofre me has said) - u cannot put a book up on screen word for word. Books and movies flow differently, and obviously the type of audience also has to be considered. There are a significant number of deviations from the book in this movie but 1)Not for a second was the continuity or the context broken, and 2)It actually meant that somebody who has memorised the book from cover to cover was left in suspense. This movie stays in your mind for days after it was viewed. The battle scenes were brilliant. The Black riders managed to look sacrier on their new steeds. Frodo is developing confidence, as the power of the Ring takes hold. When you see Gollum you actually and truly understand what a wretched creature he is, and why Bilbo could not slay him when he had the chance. Just for these bits alone, I praise the director to the sky. The deviations from the story are too numerous to count:<br />Theoden is 'possessed' by Saruman, not just fooled by Wormtongue's lies (which makes it seem more beliveable)<BR>Faramir is not 'good' as portrayed in the book, but I felt this was necessary to bring home why frodo wanted to avoid men and go off on his quest alone, and also show the what troubled times everyone was living in and the lack of trust existing among all people. The addition of the Arwen and Aragorn story also gives both of them some charcter, and is necessary as you are trying to capture the film audience. But not for a second did it seem out of place. Overall the movie was much much better than the first and there was so much more action. The only complaint I have is that it should have ended like the book did with Shelob's Lair....because now it leaves me worried and anxious considering there are only 3 more hours left - what will be cut, and what won't?<BR>I took a friend of mine along who had only seen the film version of Fellowship of the Ring (and not read any of LOTR) and she just positively loved this part, and like billions of other people around world, is awaiting the final installment
