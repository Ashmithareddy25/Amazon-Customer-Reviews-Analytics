B0012QRPU4|5.0|Breaking Bad is seriously good. I cannot stop watching it and I'm desperate for more.    This would be a grim, grim show if it weren't for the humor in the writing and complexities in the characters. The humor often has an element of realism: even in the worst situations, life can be quirky and ironic. Though there are some cartoonish supporting roles, there's also subtly and humanity infused in most of the recurring characters. And yet, it's all a little exaggerated, making it all the more compelling a story.
B00005JPLW|4.0|First off, I love the movie and have watched it more times than I care to admit. It's a perfect blend of action and artistic creativity. Those who are looking for historical accuracy need to look eslewhere. But if you, like me, have a strong desire to pick up Herodotus after seeing the film, then it's an added bonus from watching it.    The Standard Def 2 disc DVD holds up well, and has sated my appetite for watching the movie at leisure. But it has left this mere commoner in the lower end of the tax bracket to wonder what I am missing by watching the Blu-ray. The commentary by director Zach Snyder, the writer and the cinematographer keep mentioning little details that you would be seeing if you were watching it in Hi-def. Namely Persians hanging on the the ropes of the ships during the storm sequence. The commentary itself is okay. Not the best and not the worst. I probobably won't need to use that feature again, but glad I did at least once. Also, a heads up: On disc one I found an Easter Egg. Go to special features where you would activate the commentary and press up. A blood spatter will appear and then press enter. It will take you to an interesting short clip about the pre-productio process of the film, featuring Frank Miller and the pre-vis pitch that convinced WB the make the film. I liked that this easter egg was an actual feature instead of a three second blooper bit of an actor making a funny face which is normally what I find.    Disc #2 has some neat features as well, but again leaves me to wonder what I am missing with the Blu-ray version.     The first feature: 300 Spartans - Fact or Fiction, is the longest and shows the historical differences from what you see in the film. As well as interviews with the filmmakers, this has two historians who obviously like the film but politley separate it from fact.    Next is Who were the Spartans? And concentrates more on the Spartan culture. Again you have filmmakers and historians. I liked both of these features the best.    The third is called The Frank Miller Tapes and it's a nice little homage to the author of the graphic novel on which the film is based. I've grown up reading Miller and am glad that his work is now coming into the mainstream, so thumbs up on that one too.        The Making of 300 left much to be desired. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I like watching the casting and the post-production process. Here they have just the meat of the filming and it's a bit too short in my opinon.    300 in images is by far the weakest feature. It's a rapid-fire of photo's from start to finish. Epileptics should avoid this one. It's obviously a filler and something you would not want to see again.    In the additional scenes, I can see why they cut what they did. Short and not really interesting save for the last scene.    The last is the webisodes: Ah! this where most of the meat is. Three to five minute snippets concentrating on things like the costumes, training and the like. Surprisingly, I became a Lena Headly fan after watching these. Very down to earth and makes me look forward to her next film.     Anyway, those are my thoughts and I hope they help. I'm glad I got the DVD. It not a definitive version by any means, but there is some good stuff here to tide me over until I make the leap to Blu-ray. Certainly better than some of the other Special Edition DVD's that are out there.

0060558121|5.0|This is definitely Gaiman's strangest novel, if not by subject matter, by style. Reminiscent of Stephen King, the story takes many trips through time and across geography. The abrupt changes in setting and style can take a reader by surprise, but the payoff is in the journey.<br /><br />Much like SK, it's not as much about the \\"plot\\", as it is about the characters that the plot is happening to. It's about old gods vs. new gods, but it's not. It's about Shadow's journey. It's about history of the world, belief, archetypes of American culture, and it's not.  All of these things are present, but none of them overshadow the others.<br /><br />It's a great story, with great characters. Read it. It has all of the beauty of typical Gaiman prose (maybe the best \\"post modern\\" writer, stylistically at least), the strangeness of the best horror/fantasy/psyche thriller, and a few laughs and tears.  The plot is fluid, as is real life, and the characters remain, just as we all remain while the plots of our lives morph and change.<br /><br />Read it. Enjoy.
042521771X|4.0|This little book is an ideal appendage to the TV movie of \\"Emma\\". Mr Knightley is a gentleman in his thirties, living on a large and prosperous estate and unmarried. Now that he has reached this age, he realises that it's time that he married and produced an heir, but, strangely to him, cannot help but compare other ladies to his neighbour, 21 year old Emma,the irritating, headstrong daughter of an elderly gentleman who is obsessed with his health and that of everyone else. Emma is an inveterate matchmaker, determined to pair up all of the unattached men and women of her acquaintance. This, of course, causes problems because of her well intentioned meddling but she is quite determined to remain single while pairing up others. It's a quick and charming read, especially for lovers of Jane Austen.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|Like probably the majority of people who bought this album, I fell in love with \\"Love Song\\" and decided to take a chance on the full record. But when I listened to it, I wasn't really that impressed. Perhaps it was just because of the dominance of piano (which is hardly the lead instrument in 99% of the music I listen to), but most of the songs just blended into one another, with little distinction between them. \\"Love Song\\" was still great, and I thought \\"Fairytale\\" had some pretty clever lyrics, but I pretty much shelved it after ripping it to my mp3 player.    Of course, when it comes to my mp3 player, I'm a shuffle addict, and one of Sara's songs, \\"Morningside,\\" popped up. I listened to it and wondered what I was thinking when I disregarded this album a few weeks earlier. I began to give some of the other tracks another listen, and soon found myself addicted to songs like \\"Bottle it Up,\\" \\"One Sweet Love,\\" and \\"Love on the Rocks,\\" constantly listening to them four or five times in a row.    I think that, initially, it's best to digest each track individually and allow it to grow on you and get into its little nuances. I would say that ten of the 12 tracks are fantastic (and the other two are hardly bad by any means) but in the context of the full album they might not stick out and earn proper credit. The album itself may not be completely cohesive but Sara has a great voice and at its low points, the songs are merely pleasant--at its best, they're breathtaking.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This is without doubt the finest concert I have ever enjoyed. It has wonderful music throughout, performed by three world superstars at their very best, with terrific charisma and chemistry, especially during the five encores when everybody including the performers, the conductor and the audience of 20,000 were really caught up in the magic of the whole evening - and all in a wonderful setting and atmosphere. How can you possibly top that? Quite simply you can't - it just does not get any better than this. As it says in the DVD booklet, it is musically intoxicating - the evening is the stuff of myth. How I would have loved to have been there - but this DVD is of such high quality that you virtually are - and you can enjoy it over and over again. Buy it - you will not regret it.
B00154GEFU|4.0|I have been an Asia fan since the first hit from their first album.    It's been 25 years since the original line up and with the release of Phoenix...WOW!  It's as if they have never split up.  This album picks up right where Astra left off.  Phoenix is full of some 80's goodness!    Some of the songs that stick out are...Never Again, Extraordinary life, Wish I'd known all along as well as several others.    Vocals and music sound better than ever!  I highly recommend this CD for Asia fans.
B000GFLKF8|1.0|At first, as the storyline intercuts heist scenes with post-release interviews of hostages, we get an inkling of the tough investigation it'll take to separate fact from deceit ... and then the plot gradually self destructs until we realize that there's NOTHING to investigate (not a joke). All the plot elements (such as they are) have been delivered to us on a platter. And the platter is very low-cal.<br /><br />The evil villain is the one you thought it would be the exact second you saw him. The brilliant plot to bring him down is hatched by a deus-ex-machina genius whose knowledge of the villain's financial past and present is left unexplained. Let's not even go into his motivations (something like \\"I can\\"). The high-priced troubleshooter played by Jodie Foster shoots no trouble. Yet she still walks away with a paycheck after abundantly flaunting her VIP status and hinting that she has secret talents we can only guess at (cat-throwing?). Worst of all (from a moral point of view, since the movie does seem to have moral pretensions) is that the villain's evil past is a simple \\"MacGuffin\\", a trivial plot device, used to justify our sitting through yet another heist film. The details are left so vague that we neither understand the character nor have a sense of the environment of possibilities, temptations and constraints in which his wrong choices were made. One original aspect of the film: there's no corrupt Senator.<br /><br />Why would anybody want to buy this film? That implies you'd want to watch it again, when you already know if you've watched it once to the end that it holds none of its promises.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|I have been waiting to watch this film since it has been announced and so I rushed at the cinemas the night it premiered in my country. I was more satisfied than I though I would be. This is probably the best film Burton has ever directed amon all those amazing others.
1932100660|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my Pastor whose 26 year old son was diagnosed in late 1996 with testicular cancer stage 3-4.  After this family began a primarily vegetarian diet...many months later... their testimony of the feeling of vitality of life, increased energy, less aches and pains, clear headed, and slim healthy looking bodies has been remarkable, and their son is doing much better and is cancer free at this time.  Take to heart the TRUTHS in this book and literally change your life! (as for me...I am slowly making the change and noticed the difference immediately!).
0767834739|3.0|If you want to get at the heart of what keeps all three films in the RESIDENT EVIL series from being very good it is this:  the assumption that surface is everything.  The mark of good movies is the number of subtexts that they generate, but with the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, there is a powerful resistance to subtext.  For instance, even if you want to do an analysis of the tropes that attach to the main character of Alice, you will find resistance at every point.  Why?  Because the film itself has lingered in every frame on surface alone, completely resisting imbuing the film with more than just a succession of glittering images.  There are entire visual sequences that have no function whatsoever but to merely paint a pretty picture.  As a result, human elements are left entirely aside.<br /><br />This obsession with surface and spectacle is unfortunate because Alice is potentially a fascinating character.  Very occasionally the films in the series almost begin to toy with character development, but always pull back immediately after toying with it for a brief second.  At the hand of more gifted filmmakers, Alice could have had the potential to become a poor man or woman's Ripley or Buffy or Max Guevera.  At the hands of only moderately gifted filmmakers, we get little or no sense of her character, no real idea of what makes her tick, utterly no hint of what she wants, and very, very little about how she feels about things.  Milla Jovovich is so gorgeous that she manages to make us forget how poorly drawn her character is.  But the weak writing and poor direction never allows the films to ascend above slick spectacle.<br /><br />These first two movies tell the first two parts of Alice's descent into her own nightmare land.  The Alice in Wonderland imagery is reinforced at several points, not least in the original by naming the Hive's computer The Red Queen.  And in the third movie in the sequence, EXTINCTION, a version of \\"White Rabbit\\" by Collide plays over the closing credits.  During these films Alice, who initially suffers from amnesia, first learns from physical memory that she is a surreally gifted martial artist and weapons user, then recalls that she was head of security at the Hive, and later learns that her blood bonds to the virus that is killing everyone else, enhancing her strength, reflexes, and senses to absurd levels.  What keeps the series from being very good is that the films continually focus on what these powers mean for what she can do to the bad guys, never on how it is affecting her.  Contrast this to the way that this would have been done by any of a number of men (and why is it always men -- why haven't women helmed movies or TV shows with female heroes?) like James Cameron, Joss Whedon, Luc Besson, Ridley Scott, or Ron Moore.  Under any of these there would have been as much or more about what all of this was doing to Alice.  But then, all of these writers/directors/producers are more (or at least as much) concerned with the inner as the outer.<br /><br />In short, these are extraordinarily superficial films.  All surface, no depth, no interesting characters (mainly because of no character development).  Having said that, the film does present superior surface.  Once you accept that the films have nothing to offer but sheer surface, you can moderate your expectations and just go with that.  Once I realized that these films would not/could not be more than a succession of spectacles, I surrendered and moderately enjoyed them.  Was I ever truly entertained?  Of course not.  Was I bored?  Not really.<br /><br />This second film is, in my opinion, marginally better than the first film.  It feels less tied to the strict gameplay narrative that hobbled the first film.  On the other hand, I really didn't like the feel of Raccoon City in it.  It never really came to feel like a real place.  It just felt like a succession of sets, whether indoor or outdoor.  Contrast this with THE MATRIX, where the city of the construct felt much more alive and actual.<br /><br />I will add one last observation.  The three films that make up the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy (soon to be a quartet, with the addition of RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION) easily comprise the most interesting films ever made based on video games.

0783225849|5.0|I bought this movie about a month ago, and I love it. Hitchcock was brilliant, and this has to be my favorite movie that he's done. While others cringe at the \\"shower scene\\" and therefore deem it as traumatic or just horrifying, I can't help but to love the movie even more. It can freak a person out, but it doesn't once show the person actually being stabbed. The actors are also very wonderful. Anthony Perkins plays the owner of the motel, and I find him very talented in his roles...I won't tell you more about the movie though, as it may ruin it for you. So, if you are a Hitchcock fan...even if you're not, I suggest you get this movie, because it is one pyschological thriller you won't want to miss.

The second moved out of the Hive into Raccoon City.  The third moves into the deserts of Utah and Nevada.  Much of the action takes place in a Las Vegas that has been reclaimed by the desert.  I haven't played any of the games so I can't comment on how closely they adhere to game play, but the real influence on this third film is the second MAD MAX film, better known in the U.S. as THE ROAD WARRIOR.  Though Alice isn't as cynical and certainly isn't amoral like Mel Gibson's Max was, like Max she is an unredeemable loner who can only enable others reach the Promised Land, without going there herself.

B000G75994|5.0|I agree completely with the above reviewer. Maria Joao Pires is one the world's most influential and admired Pianists, her interpretations of Mozart, Chopin, Schumann and Beethoven have been lauded and her concerts are sold out within days. Throughout her career though,  she returns again and again to the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.    Mozart Sonatas lack the pathos and gravity of Beethoven's, but reveal a beauty more etheric and elusive. It is not for nothing that most pianists do not dare to touch them, as they represent a world that seems simple and one-dimensional, but is in fact the complete opposite. Mozart' inclination to simplicity reveals, when played by someone with a kindred soul,  his Incomparable Genius. Maria Joao Pires does just that.    Her tone is a delicate and lyrical one: warm, soulful, clear and adept to Mozart's subtle and intricate compositions. What I most like about her is her sense of timing and flowing momentum that expresses the essence of a Mozartean Sonata.    You could say this is the most rounded and soulful collection of Mozart's sonatas . But that would not give enough credit to Maria Joao Pires Artistry. Each and every piece is played with an almost unassuming elegance and clarity; no manierisms, ideosyncracies, just a springing forth of the Music.     She creates an atmosphere of delicate intimacy and tranclucent beauty, I have  never heared before. She expresses it all: the elegance and lyricism of Mozart love for Opera, his ability to summon a sense of heartbreaking joy and splendour, longing and humour, deep agony and elusive freedom...the whole gamut of the highest of human sentiments and capabilities.    Of course there are other great boxes such as Brendel, Uchida, De La Rocha, Gould. But Pires' unique empathic sensitivity capture something which surpasses just a great performance but touches the heart of Mozart's music.
B000LWXCKM|5.0|Mandylion was the beginning of the new sound for the Gathering. The mix of hard rock guitars, textured keyboard layers and beautiful female vocals is amazing. Although about 13 years old this album is an equal to new albums like Within Temptations The Heart of Everything and Lacuna Coils Karmacode and Comalies. Lacuna Coil was the first band I discovered in this mostly European Genre.     The songs Strange Machines and Eleanor are very powerful and remind me alot of Within Temptation. In Motion #1 reminds me more of early Lacuna Coil. Sand And Mercury has a similar sound to some of the material on the Anti-M CD Damage (check the songs Rage and Damage in the Dream if you have itunes). But overall the album is unique and doesn't sound \\"like\\" any other band.     Mandylion is a good entry album for someone who has never listened to them before. If you like this album Nighttime birds is a good second choice. Another band of interest would be Nightwish. A little more symphonic metal than the gathering but the album Once is quite good (check songs Siren and Nemo).     Mandylion is by far one of their best.

B000024D4R|5.0|The biggest issue I have with Animals is that it is not longer. It is a short album and I wanted more. Not as melodic as Wish You Were Here and Dark Side but the beginning of the more angry side of Waters lyrics. Dogs is a favorite track of mine as well as Pigs. The songs are longer which is nice. A very cool album. Turn out the lights and listen loud.
006113399X|4.0|Chosen as the best ever Norwegian crime novel, this British translation intertwines the Norwegians who fought for the Germans on the Eastern Front in WWII with the neo-Nazis of modern Oslo. This rarely explored episode in Norwegian history (\\"we don't talk about that\\") explains the motives for the soldiers and offers an interpretation of the current skinhead recruits. Adding color to the plot is the ubiquitous alcoholic detective, the pretty young partner, the international arms scheme, the Nazi-archives of Vienna and a dash of simplistic psychology. It's a riveting read with a few red herrings, a twist here and there and a dangling finale. I loved being back on the streets of Oslo again. [note: I read the British paperback edition. Excellent translation.]
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I haven't had the opportunity to see the whole season, but the shows that I have seen have been very well done, well planned, and the actors playing the characters couldn't have been chosen any better, specially I am fascinated by the performance of \\"Sophie\\", an interesting character that we can see dealing with the trauma of a bad marriage, and the twisted interpretation in her young mind, of the reasons why her father was not playing a more active role in her life.  I congratulate the director, and wish we had more programs like this.  The drama seen resembles many of our current issues, and we can learn throu the characters how to deal better with our realities.  I am going to order the set, and keep it with the few shows that deserve watching more than once.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|Don't set yourself up for disappointment.  Stargate SG-1's Ark of Truth is rather pedestrian.  The writer/director just didn't come up to par.    This doesn't mean that if you are a Stargate SG-1 fan that you shouldn't manfully suffer through it, if only to see Christopher Judge's Teal'c explain a personal Truth to Vala's Ori devotee husband.      When the first Star Trek movie came out, all of us fans went to see it. It was great fun seeing our favorite characters again -- Captain Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Scotty -- even if the story plot was mostly derivative from earlier TV episodes and some was plain boring.  And then  there was the great new special effect of the Enterprise going into warp drive and the great new music.    But this movie doesn't even have the characters we came to love in the early Stargate SG-1 seasons.  Richard Dean Anderson's fabulous Colonel Jack O'Neill is replaced by a couple refugees from Farscape -- Ben Browder and Claudia Black, and Amanda Tapping's Captain (later Major) Carter is turned into a Kewpie doll.      Worst of all, Teal'c is called \\"Muscles\\" by Vala and not made to regret it.  Michael Shank's Daniel Jackson did reasonably okay; but it was an ego choice, not a good character realization choice to stop wearing the glasses.  I could have forgiven all this if only we'd had one cameo of General Jack O'Neill.    Forget special effects.  Also pedestrian.  Plus the director didn't seem to know how to make the transition from small to large screen.  Too often his choices for acting and camera angles and dramatic close ups are stilted TV screen fare, not smoothly inconspicuous as in a good movie.    BUT, without us supporting Star Trek: The Movie, there wouldn't have been Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which was really great science fiction movie story writing and acting.  Nor would there have been Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, which was such a lot of fun.    So, buy this anemic movie and pray that the next one redeems it, and that hopefully someone who understood the magic of the first 4 seasons (before the French bought the series and began ruining it) is brought in to do the writing and someone with some imagination and originality collaborates.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|......well, why not,,,,everbody else says it.  This is a fun movie.   No high priced stars. Just good acting backed up by an innovative production team.  The one outstanding factor here is the handheld camera technique that takes the high road and does not annoy or detract from the forwarding of the plot and storyline. It does, in fact, enhance it.  One might take notice that the PG-13 rating is unique for this genre but welcomed. No gratuitous profanity or sex.  Good show...let's look forward to a sequel.
B00154GEFU|5.0|These guys (Wetton, Downes, Palmer, Howe) have not released an album as \\"Asia\\" since 1983's \\"Alpha\\" (the follow-up, \\"Astra,\\" was released without the participation of Howe).  Remarkably, Phoenix, builds upon the outstanding debut, \\"Asia\\", and it's mediocre follow-up, \\"Alpha,\\" and leaves behind the excess and vacuousness of their third, and previously final, album \\"Astra.\\"  Putting aside the ongoing Payne vs. Wetton debate, this is an extraordinary album.  Admittedly, Payne/Asia's last album, \\"Silent Nation,\\" was also fantastic, but lacked the depth of this release.  \\"Phoenix\\" boasts some classic Asia sounds, e.g., \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Alibis\\" could have come off of either \\"Asia\\" or \\"Alpha,\\" but also reveals a maturity and depth not previously seen in songs such as \\"Orchard of Mines\\" and \\"An Extraordinary Life.\\"  If you have a fondness for '80s Asia, I would classify this as a \\"don't miss\\" release.  You won't be disappointed.
B000YABYLA|1.0|This is just my opinion, but this movie was neither funny nor did it make sense.  There was too much hype about this movie and after seeing it, I was deeply disappointed.  Maybe this movie appeals to people have had no knowledge of life beyond their shelter homes, because where I'm from I see situations like this everyday.  The jokes in this movie were not funny as all, they were actually stupid.  The music was also horribly stupid too (Simon Cowell would say the same thing), and I'm still wondering how Ellen Page got nominate for best actress; my sixteen year old cousin could have play the same role with no acting experience.  Throughout the whole movie Juno was talking nonsense and stupidity (is she suppose to be that stupid). I know she plays a sixteen year old girl, but at least have her character be more intelligent and can someone tell me why Juno had that strange pipe in her mouth.  Also I didn't understand why Juno's stepmother snap at the ultrasound technician and the fact that her sister is name Liberty Bell.  This was the biggest waste of my time.  Thanks for your time, goodbye.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The thing that separate's Joss Whedon's stuff from most other writers is the characters.      Whether you are talking about Buffy, Toy Story or Firefly, the quality and the depth of the characters is what makes the material captivating.  Its certainly what separates the truly great TV series from the merely good.      With Buffy, Joss got 7 seasons to develop his characters.  And they developed and evolved over time in response to their experiences - as they would if they were real.  He is never lazy - never resorts to radical shifts in personality to support a story line.  Witness the transformation of Willow over 7 seasons from nervous nerd to confident witch.      And therein lies the greatest disappointment - our lost opportunity to get to know these great Firefly characters better.  Inara, Sheppard Book, River, we barely knew ye.
0807262013|5.0|I was surprised to find that this is considered a children's story, and is actually sold in the children's section of bookstores.  But I think that's just because the protagonist happens to be a child.  This is the third and final book in the His Dark Materials series, and it's an engrossing tale.  I would recommend it to any science fiction/fantasy aficionado.  I bought the CD's, and they make any long drive seem brief.
B000ZLFALI|2.0|I decided to write this review when I saw the number of poeple giving it 5 stars and hailing it as a fantastic must-see movie. Were they watching the same thing I was? I'm not kidding when I say this is the most pointless, vacuous movie I've seen in years. I'm so glad I didn't pay anything to see it. If I'd been in a theater I literally would have walked out and demanded my money back.    Boy meets girl. Girl's brother gets drafted and sent to Vietnam. There. I've just told you the ENTIRE PLOT. There is no major conflict between the main characters, no climax, and no resolution. Brother comes back alive and in one piece, and boy & girl discover all you need is love. Based on the opening scene I figured there must be something dramatic that would happen - someone dies tragically, someone mourns lost love...nope!     In case you didn't know the gimmick, the film is a musical based entirely on Beatles songs. Only thing they forgot...A PLOT! It seems the screenwriters also didn't know that for a musical to be successful, the songs need to carry the plot forward and/or tell us something about the characters. Not here. At least ten of the songs are just randomly thrown in there and serve no purpose other than to stretch the movie into 2 and a quarter hours that feel like 3. Characters like Prudence and Dr. Robert also add nothing to the film except excuses for songs. Many of the songs chosen for the film are so obvious I just fast-forwarded through them. Only a few like \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" work, but that's mostly because of the arrangement and vocals.    I became thoroughly bored with the film about 90 minutes in, then realized there were another 45 minutes to go. I fast-forwarded, thinking that there HAS to be some kind of plot twist, some kind of drama or conflict and climax. Nothing. Just more songs and glaringly obvious Beatles references.    The only redeeming feature of the movie is Dana Fuch's raspy rock vocals, but she manages to make her cliched\\"Janis Joplin\\" character wholly uninteresting.    I'm just astonished by the number of people who think this is a fantastic movie. It tries to be a 1960's \\"Moulin Rouge\\" but fails miserably. Many of the songs seem chosen just because they were popular songs that the director liked (or ones that the cast could sing) but they neither advance the plot nor flesh out the characters. That's a disappointment, because it had the potential to be a good film.  Instead it relies on gimmicks and filler to disguise the lack of plot and the lack of character development.    For what it's worth, I'm both a Beatles fan and a former flower child, so I picked up on all the references, but most of them just seemed obvious and cliched to me.  With characters named Jude, Lucy, Prudence, etc. you know what songs are going to be performed. The film takes place in the 1960's, but it's not a film ABOUT the 1960's.  The era just provides a convenient backdrop for covers of \\"Helter Skelter\\" and fillers like the unnecessary \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"Mr Kite\\" sequences. Again, they add nothing to the film except length. I didn't find the visuals to be as interesting as others claim they are. At times the movie just tries too hard to make the songs work and fit in to the scenes, instead of writing a script based on series of songs with a progressive theme.    To paraphrase Ringo, \\"Do pass it by\\".

630522577X|5.0|After reading all these reviews, there's nothing else left to say about the story or the acting. Definitely everyone on this planet adores 'My Fair Lady' - it's a classic! Now, about this DVD edition (the first one): The restoration job is great. The quality of picture and sound is excellent. If you care about the soundtrack, the US edition has the right pitch. Most European movie releases do not use the right pitch. Dialogs and music (or songs) are played at a higher speed so they don't sound natural and the European DVD edition of 'My Fair Lady' is no exception. However, the US DVD edition maintains the correct sound and the audio part is exactly like on the movie soundtrack CD.
B00133KFGW|4.0|Slow,sweet, sad movie.I love this movie. It keeps you holding out for hope the whole movie.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is the best race movie ever made. Period. And I doubt one like it can ever be made again because this was done in the real world and, now, everyone (directors etc) will want to do one using computer graphics and it will not have the same feel of realism.[\\"Driven\\" with Stallone would be a good example of this] Also, I doubt, due to safety concerns/insurance etc, that one can be made this way again.    The \\"How the Movie was Made\\" is worth a huge chunk of the selling price.  The quality of the DVD is a great improvement, especially on an HD TV, over the VHS copy I've owned for some time.    The reason I say \\"Grand Prix\\" is the best is that \\"LeMans\\" lacks a strong story line or its story line pales next to the action, whereas \\"Grand Prix\\"s story hangs in there fairly well.  However, one can argue \\"LeMans\\" has just as good race photography and, again, I doubt if a movie like it can be made now.    \\"Grand Prix\\" has an excellent cast of very well known (at the time) actors from the U.S. and Europe. The photography of Europe is great as are the race scenes. There is romance involved to keep the story line going on something other than race after race. There is some tear jerker moments for the sentimental.     Speaking of story lines, I remember when \\"LeMans\\" came out that one of the NBC \\"Today Show\\" film critics, Judith Crist, lambasted the movie and said words to the effect that \\"McQueen should have shot it on 8mm and shown it as home movies\\". She's also the critic who said that \\"Candy\\" would set back pornography a 100 years. :)     As for story lines, another decent effort at a race movie is \\"Winning\\" with Paul Newman and his wife. A product of its day, the film tries pretty hard to combine a decent story with racing. Along with racing there are cheating wives, just the thing to spice up a race movie.  I would guess this is where PN picked up his love of racing which lasted 30+ years. His co-star is his wife.    And, last and least, is \\"Red Line 7000\\" which, when itcame out, was a pretty cool drive-in movie and still stands up as a bit of kitsch of the time. The race descriptions by the \\"on track\\" announcer are guite funny but where else are you going to see a guy driving a Shelby Daytona Coupe around on the street? Besides, its one of James Caan's first roles, if not the first. Oh, and the \\"on track announcer\\" in \\"Winning\\" might be of the same cloth if memory serves.    One reason I probably have a soft spot for these movies is that they came out about the time I was a young Sports Car Club of America racer myself.  My new wife and I were really into this stuff. We drove 200 miles round trip one weekday night in order to see \\"LeMans\\" several weeks earlier than what would have been the case if we hadn't, due to where we lived.    I've recently purchased \\"Winning\\", \\"LeMans\\" and \\"Grand Prix\\" to donate to my small town library, spreading the joy of racing. Thanks to AMAZON, I can afford to do it.

I still have the movie on VHS and watch it occasionally every now and then I just don't have the doll anymore but excellent movie very good.  2 thumbs up.  If you like Roger Rabbit then get this movie in dvd better quality of the picture I think but if your old school then go for VHS.
B00009MGGI|4.0|This is one of my very favorite portrayals of the abuse of power, and the wickedness that men (and women)can do  on their way to rule. Ian Richardson was described by one reviewer as \\"reptilian\\" and realistically, it's a bit of an insult to reptiles....however, there's a twinkle in his eye and a tiny bit of remorse now and then that gives the character depth and creates a smidgen of sympathy for him.  Diane Fletcher, as the nasty Mrs. Urquhart, makes for a less sympathetic character, as she supports her husband in all of his scandalous behaviour, and whispers, serpent-like, suggestions of further evils to which he can aspire.<br />As with other BBC series, the other characters are equally well-drawn, and then entire series is gripping from beginning to end.<br />Fed up with politics?  Want some support for your conspiracy theories?  OR just enjoy a well-acted portrayal of two psychopaths and the troubled people around them? This is a keeper.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Rock critics are a lazy bunch. They kinda have to be to churn out review after review so there is no great incentive for them to dig deep into the influences of an act when they have to meet deadlines. So let's set the record straight on a few things about this act. This album does not sound like Paul Simon's \\"Graceland.\\" It's not an over-produced pop mess produced by a hack who got a bunch of African musicians (Who he didn't pay by the way) to make his trite and sappy love songs sound neat and exotic (When I had it foisted on me by college acquaintences in the mid-80's it still sounded bland and over-baked). So enough with the Paul Simon comparisons!    Almost as weak are the Talking Heads comparisons. Sure, Vampire Weekend share an affinity with The Heads for Afro-pop but that's where it ends. Vampire Weekend's vocalist doesn't have Byrne's annoyingly spastic vocalizings. More often than not he sounds like Sting and the band like early Police, especially on \\"Blakes Got A New Face\\". Other influences strike this older listener: The Feelies, Orange Juice, Haircut 100 and The English Beat. There's a bit of the early 80's yen for jangle pop mixed in as well. Refreshing after the spate of grunge, faux punk and emo indie shoe-gazing we've suffered through for tooooo long now!    The band are tight and melodic and also show a capacity for baroque classical arrangements on tracks like \\"M-79.\\" Their lyrics are bright and clever, perhaps a bit too clever in that the band has an \\"in joke\\" going on that it will take the listener several plays to grasp, if they ever do. This is a promising first album by a young band that deserves the hype! I especially recommend it to fans of early 80's guitar-oriented New Wave.
B000002GLT|5.0|I bought the LP in 1970 and just got the CD. This is a classic in the sense that it held its own no matter what happened to music and in music in the past 38 years. Lots of soft drumless (!) swing with a strong blues (Mayall) background. The track \\"Nature is Disappearing\\" is prophetic and gives me the chills today as it did back then. A MUST HAVE!

B000065AI3|5.0|Back in '76 when this was released, \\"Breakdown\\" and \\"American Girl\\" were the tunes that made me take notice and want this LP. Upon first listen I discovered an LP full of good tunes. Particular favorites of mine--\\"Strangered in the Night\\", \\"Luna\\", \\"Fooled Again(I Don't Like It) and \\"The Wild One, Forever\\". Tom Petty has released some fine albums over a long and distinguished career but I really don't think he's ever topped this one.

When I first heard this one(many years ago) I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but after a couple more listens it grew on me more and more until it really became one of my favorite Springsteen albums. I love his stuff with the E St. Band, but this is a nice change of pace--The Boss at his basic best.Give this one a couple of serious listens and I bet you'll come away feeling the same.
0553582038|3.0|If this was really one book split in two then the next book should be fantastic as all the characters and plots I really didn't care for were shoved into this book. It's still a good book compared to most of the other fiction out there, but compared to the first three it is really weak.<br /><br />As far as the publisher being reluctant to put out a 1500 page book to accomodate the stories, I think that is ridiculous. How many people who have read the first three books would drop the series if book 4 was that long? Probably not as many as are conisdering dropping it after this book.<br /><br />However I would not let this book alone prevent someone from reading the series. Especially if the next book gets back on track. If you are considering reading the series you may want to wait until the 5th book is closer to being published as you could then hopefully jump right from this book into that one and maybe book 4 won't seem as bad.

1416550518|5.0|Grace Reeves was only a child, a mere 14 years old, when she began working at Riverton House.  The time is early 1914, just as the first World War was beginning.  So many changes were in the immediate future, and this would be a time for secrets and spies.  The war that would change an age: Edwardian civility unravels into the roaring Twenties.<br /><br />At 98, Grace is contacted by a filmmaker working on a movie about the family who had lived at Riverton, for a factual details from one who was there.  These aventures take Grace out of the Old Ladies home in which she lives, and stimulates her narration of her memories.<br /><br />Grace is such a perfect creation by Kate Morton, that her health and thoughts follow that of a woman of her age.  I kept thinking, what a wonderful woman to know -- she comes to life; her character is that rich and deep.<br /><br />This is a mystery, and Grace is the only one who remembers, or actually knows the truth.  She left Riverton as a young woman, but took a dark secret with her; the presumed suicide of a famous young poet, R.S. Hunter, at the property's lake.  Two sisters, Hannah and Emmeline, were at the lake the night of the death.  And neither sister ever spoke to the other again.<br /><br />Weaving the story through bits and clips taken during many interviews because Grace tires from the sessions, she shows her true age so well that my mother (83) was impressed -- every thought and acton of Grace was exactly right for her age.<br /><br />Grace states that no one knows, or has ever known, the real story about the death of the poet. Emmeline is jealous of Hannah, and each scheme to have their own life, away from the control of parents and guardians; and then World War I started in 1914.<br /><br />This is well written.  It does not start off with a bang that keeps you riveted to your seat as you quickly turn page after page -- no, this is a book you read to savor the words, phrases, and characters.  You know, that the end will be revealed, perhaps a haunting love triangle, perhaps a murder rather than suicide, perhaps another scenario brought on by Hannah's schemes to have her own life, and the younger Emmeline's jealousy; ultimately the truth about the poet's death is revealed.<br /><br />I was reminded of the movie Titanic because the sinking of such a luxury liner, could only be told from someone who had been there.  It too was the end of a era.  This book is a movie waiting to happen<br /><br />Excellent book -- It is definitely 5 stars.gle, perhaps a murder rather than suicide, perhaps another scenario brought on by Hannah's schemes to have her own life, and the younger Emmeline's jealousy; ultimately the truth about the poet's death is revealed.

B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|This is one of the best action movies I've seen in years. The film is a mix of the films 'Memento','Ground Hog Day' and 'Spider-Man'. The premise is interesting, there is lots of action, a decent love story and a guy with a super power!.....well sort of. Nick Cage is perfectly cast as a magician in Las Vegas with a unique ability to see into his own imediate future. Pay close attention as Cage's character will go from seeing his future to present in a matter of seconds. This reminded me of Spider-man's \\"spider sense\\" as Cage is able to do some pretty cool tricks with his incredible ability. Jessica Biel is Cage's love interest and she does a very good job...not to mention, she's really nice to look at! A very cool story that had me totally engrossed from beginning to end.

B000YABYLA|4.0|Juno is a tale which starts out a little annoying, but by the end of the film,, it wins you over. Not being a parent, I have a problem listening to smug teenagers who think they are wise beyong their years. The smug attitude of the young girls turned me off as a person looking in from the outside, but once the movie gets going and the characters are fleshed out, I enjoyed this quirkly little film and the excellent cast. The story is real and everything rings true. It's a film well worth your time and money. The single disc version is very good with an excellent transfer and some interesting extra material.
B000O77SOK|5.0|The Practice is far and away one of the best courtroom dramas ever on TV. It is also has the smartest writing, storylines, dialogue, et al. I loved this show from the first episode until the last. Even when the cast went through an `upheaval', I stuck with the show for the remaining characters and also, to see how the new ones would turn out. I would love to buy the fist season on DVD, but I am afraid that what has happened to me with Cagney & Lacey, Here Come The Brides, Alias Smith & Jones  to name a few. I have had the first seasons for quite some time now and the additional seasons are nowhere on the horizon. For those of us who loved these classic TV shows I wish the studios would just offer the entire series at once. In the long run it would save them money. I would rather pay $200 for an entire series of The Practice than wait years and have to keep handing over $30 or $40 for each season as they dribble out ...Now can someone explain why shows that are currently on TV have vastly more seasons out then the classic shows? Shows currently on: Two & a Half Men, Weeds, Friday Night Lights, Californication, The Closer, Burn Notice, Army Wives, Boston Legal, The Office, Rescue Me...That is 10 TV shows currently on TV with first run episodes, yet the past seasons are coming out on DVD at a very frequent rate but we must be made to wait a year or two, or in some cases (which it looks like for this great show) forever for additional seasons of the classic shows- If the studio heads are listening ...get with it guys & gals, don't make us wait a lifetime for great shows to be put on DVD!

0143039504|4.0|I recently decided to do something that I had never had a chance to do for a LONG time, read.  I mean reading actual books (not stuff on the internet, magazines, etc.).  Getting back into the classics, my friend kept telling me to read Jane Austen.  Back when I was a teenager my attempt to read Jane Austen totally fell flat (and unlike so many other reviewers, I was not ever required to read anything of Jane Austen (even up to my AP English Lit. class)...so fast forward to the present, where in my attempts to actually read and read classics...I decided to give her another shot.  So I purchased the book because I love to have anthologies/omibuses as I get through books REALLY fast.<br /><br />The book is exactly what I paid for.  It is a bit pricey for a paperback, but when you are really reading you tend to think about other stuff.  The reviewer who has problems with the font (without having poor eyesight) made me a bit confused.  I am 27, and I don't have the best eyesight but I can easily read this a bit over 12 feet away from my face as I love to read while reclining or with the book on my lap (it is pretty hefty to have it not rest on something after a while).

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I loved it. (no spoilers in this review)<br /><br />I could write for hours, but no one wants to read all that much. Let me just state that the sets were magnificent; the score was great; the explosions rocked; the private jokes that hearken back to snippits from the series made me laugh out loud; the plot was thick with layers of tension (because when does SG-1 get just one problem to overcome?)...<br /><br />Even viewers who are intimately familiar with the Stargate SG-1 series lore will benefit from the quick-n-dirty \\"review\\" feature on the DVD. I recommend watching this, not just so you can see what a great job the editors did, but to give you the refresher before diving into the movie.<br /><br />And when you dive in, hang onto your couch cushions. Make sure your glass is full and the pitcher of your favorite beverage is nearby because you're not going to want to even pause this thing to go get more. Once the movie started rolling, I couldn't tear myself away. The action starts and the storyline is already pulling you in. There's backstory to develop and it develops fast. There's no long, drawn-out explanation. No. It's \\"dive in and then speed to present-day because we've got a movie with a ton of action to pack in.\\" And some fancy explosions. And some cool bad guys.<br /><br />The special effects we've been spoiled with on the series were magnified. The dialogue and interaction among characters was dead on. I couldn't ask for more. Well...except maybe for more movies. When does the next one come out?<br /><br />From Sandy Lender, \\"Some days, I just want the dragon to win.\\"
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Wes Anderson fans--and, more generally, fans of quirky comedy blended with moments of poignancy--will be sure to appreciate The Darjeeling Limited. The film follows three estranged brothers (Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Adrien Brody) on a mostly ill-fated \\"spiritual journey\\" to India, where they make a clumsy attempt at fraternal bonding and try to find their mother, who went missing after their father's tragic death and is now living in a convent. The Darjeeling Limited is reminiscent of other Wes Anderson films, especially The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic, with its flawed, idiosyncratic characters searching in odd, dysfunctional ways for a connection within a dysfunctional family.  Scenes of India add color and chaos--while the brothers' attempts at manufacturing a spiritual epiphany (complete with a detailed itinerary) add irony--to this great film.
0307265730|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri just has a way of drawing you in. She keeps her distance from her characters. They are kept at arm's length. I absolutely love the way she leaps ahead in time within a single paragraph, vaulting over unnecessary components of the story with ease. \\"A Choice of Accommodations\\" might be my favorite here, the palpable tensions in a seasoned relationship fueling a story about a visit to a familiar but unfamiliar place. \\"The information fell between them, valuable for the years he'd kept it from her, negligible now that he'd told.\\" But \\"Only Goodness\\" is compellling to watch unfold, a gripping portrait of the strains in a family and, to me, about adjusting expectations. Some terrific images and writing throughout.

That would be a devastating thing to find out.    I gave it three stars.  The content deserves five.  The price brings it down to three.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Has no one else noticed?<br />What amazes me about this, one of my all time favorite albums of all time.<br />The Beach Boys only sing on it. They play absolutely no instruments on it.<br />Produced by Brain Wilson & Phil Specter. They can make anyone sound this good.<br /><br />At least The Beatles played on Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, didn't they?<br /><br />And golly gee, Paul McCartney  did get so upset the way Phil Specter produced Let It Be.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|As mentioned before by others, there were scratched discs in the set that came to me, now awaiting the new replacement, hopefully no more scratched discs.     Today when watching season 6, discovered there were no english subtitles, which is strange as the amazon desription of the individual set of season 6 has got english subtitles. How come my set got no english subtitles, is it their production forgot to add in english subtitles?! Hopefully the new replacement will also fix this subtitle problem..
0765318741|5.0|This story is almost completely different from the movie.  The basic idea is the same, but the actual movie interpretation is a departure from the original story.  Which is fine with me, I think the book and the movie are both great.  The book was written a long time ago, and is more of a short story than anything at only about 160 pages.  The movie was great, too.  As usual, when Hollywood takes a book and turns it into a movie they use a lot of poetic license.  If you want to kill a couple of hours, read this.  You won't be disappointed.

B000UNYJXQ|1.0|Moore \\"documentaries\\" (disguised falsehoods dressed up as documentaries) have continually been tarnished as exercises in dishonesty and with well-founded reason. Bowling for Columbine was so infested with willful misinformation crafted to subserve Moore's liberal ideology that many reporters were easily able to publish articles exposing these deceptions. Fahrenheit 911 was equally so chock full of lies that critics were derisively able to cite each factual abomination after another. Now comes Sicko which, after Moore's abysmally notorious track record, doesn't raise hopes that it will finally be an accurate or intellectually honest film. After watching it, a truthful person should have (if they have a conscience and aren't ideologically bent) much outrage at further fabrications throughout the propaganda film.<br /><br />Even without watching Sicko, it'd be possible for a person to already credibly write off Moore's \\"documentary\\" as chicanery because of his mentally ill thesis: socialized healthcare systems (the nightmares in Canada, Cuba and Europe) are apparently superior to the US system of innovation and privatization!!!! With such a laughably asinine thesis, Moore has to longingly resort to abusive manipulation in Sicko to just appear plausible with his BS-claims.<br /><br />I'll easily unmask and rebuke glaringly shameless flaws Moore planted all over Sicko. I do this because I know confronting Moore sheeple (read: ideological liberals with no argumentative powers) is a contemptibly easy victory on account of the fact that liberals never deal with facts but only LIES. I also foreshadow that no liberal and Moore-follower will be able to refute any of my exposes of Moore's BS and falsehoods; this is because they cannot window-dress lies.<br /><br />Moore falsifies that ERs simply \\"don't\\" overcrowd\\" in the land of nightmarish, universal healthcare, Canada. However, according to the Manhattan Institute's David Gratzer, Canada's own government released a study which humiliated Moore's propaganda by citing ONLY HALF OF PATIENTS are treated in a timely manner with most waits being interminable. In Toronto, the average wait time was FOUR HOURS with one in ten waiting a third-world style TEN HOURS!!!! Backing up the godless crisis of waiting list enormities in Canada, a study by the Fraser Institute think-tank actually revealed waiting lists have WORSENED in Canada from 9.3 weeks to see a specialist in 1993 to 17.8 weeks in 2006--twice what's considered clinically reasonable!!!!<br /><br />Moore's undeserved utopia Canada suffers--more like hemorrhages--from doctor shortages. According to the Fraser Institue, in true third-world style, Canada only had 2 doctors per 1000 residents in 2004 while the US enjoyed 2.4 per 1000 residents. This inequality amounted to 300 less doctors in a city of a million. The reason for this hemorrhaging of doctors from Moore's socialist utopia of Canada is the unprofitability of practicing medicine in Canada, as Canadian doctors shabbily EARN ONLY 42% OF US DOCTORS' salaries since Canadian doctors' salaries are paid by the state and capped.<br /><br />Just these two irrecoverably extreme predicaments in Canadian \\"healthcare\\" (an oxymoron!) are criminally whitewashed by Moore; there's no fairness or balance in his \\"documentary\\" that even tries to tackle why Canada suffers these problems. Instead, egregiously damning facts like the aforementioned are concealed as Moore selectively talks to Canadians who AREN'T ILL and so praise their disastrous system with the brainwashed mentality of North Koreans praising Kim Jong Il.<br /><br />Turning to Britain, Moore's other championed socialist utopia, Moore purports that there, people have a right to see a doctor and not worry about cost. However in Britain, people also enjoy the right to wait in line while risking their lives. According to the National Center for Policy Analysis, a study regarding Brits who were diagnosed with TREATABLE colon cancer found 20% of those dilapidated into TERMINAL cases by the time of actual treatment!!!!<br /><br />Additionally, Brits have the right to be deprived of access to lifesaving drugs. For instance, the bre*st cancer-fighting drug, Taxol, isn't even available in some parts of Britain despite its advantageousness; less than a third of Brits who get heart attacks receive beta-blockers despite the stat that use of beta-blockers reduces death by 20%; and according to the WHO, upwards of 25000 Brits die annually of cancer due to inability to obtain the latest treatments.<br /><br />The real movie waiting to be made is one where the thesis is US HEALTHCARE IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD and how socialized countries' \\"healthcare\\" is deadly. My aforementioned facts utterly verify this thesis, and no proponent of Moore-style universal \\"healthcare\\" can refute them. It's mournful to read the \\"reviews\\" (read: sycophantic brownnosing) of the Moore-sheeple because they fail to provide stats confirming Moore's allegations as dependable. They only have liberal anecdotes. Moore and his fans have overstepped into not just chicanery, but hazardousness. When from my above-cited statistics it's clear that Canadians/Brits are crying out in agony at their sub-par \\"healthcare\\" systems (yet too self-destructive/obstinate to change it), Moore and company are callous for hyping them. What sane American would want socialized medicine to invade the US after reading my aforementioned statistics???? For this alone, one shouldn't vote DemocRAT in 08!!!!ime of actual treatment!!!!

B00132D808|5.0|First, this is not the type of Panic you are used to.  Their first album was a mix of youthful self-loathing and wonderful truthful lyrics.  All in all, it was amazingly original.  \\"Odd\\" however is an evolution of sorts.  People loved the freshman album and tend to want every other album to be extensions of the first; a continuation.  Instead we get treated to something completely different.  Still keeping their \\"Panic\\" style harmonies and lyric melodies we find out exactly what would happen if Sgt. Pepper had a much younger and hipper sister who just happened to like the austere sounds of Emo.  For me, the formula works.  There is just about something here for everyone.  With a bit of big band, swing, country, and even a harpsichord, Panic! somehow manages to recreate themselves as few bands have before by blending genres.  Die-hard fans of the Panic! or Beatles might be disappointed however.  People seeking either the new Beatles or the old Panic should just purchase those albums.  \\"Odd\\" is simply an experiment into other forms not typically associated with current music or trends.  Luckily, I found just about every song here enjoyable.  If I had never heard of Panic! before today and picked up \\"Odd\\" before knowing their previous sound, I still would have enjoyed it just as much.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is a great enchanting tale about music, destiny, and fate.  I loved it and would recommend it to everyone that still believes that there is truly good in the world today!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Losing Firefly is a huge tragedy.  Unfortunatly I didn't know how good it was until it had already gone.  I think this was a failure by the producers at keeping it at the front...I fell in love with the cast, concept and the entire series and really became frustrated to know it would never go forward....
B000LV63SQ|5.0|As an old time rock n' roller, this has always been one of my favorite albums (oops, CDs).  For me, the collaboration between Mr. Townsend and Mr. Lane works just perfectly, with each balancing out the other, to create a CD that is right for certain of my moods.  I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have for over 30 years.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|If You are a Charlton Heston Fan or a Sophia Loren Fan You need this movie in Your collection. It was long over due that they put this movie on DVD. I Hope You will enjoy it as much as I did. Enjoy
B0013FXWU6|2.0|With the possible exception of \\"No country for Old Men\\" this has got to be the most undeserving Oscar nominated film. Yes, Daniel Lewis was excellent as always but that was the only redeeming part of this. It was an hour longer than it should have been.  The plot was shallow and the characters were thin- except for our main character and the preacher. It really dragged on- I heard people in the theater moving around in their seat and looking at their watches.  so, who would love this movie?  those who are interested in the origin of the oil business and their crooked ways might find this amusing.
B00008WT5M|3.0|I bought this album for Moneytalks and Thunderstruck.  Usually on AC/DC albums, I buy the CD for one or two songs and warm to the other songs over time -- eventually learning to love the whole album.  I've had it for several months now, and just can't get into the rest of the songs.  They all sound the same and most are in the same key.  I know AC/DC thrives on using the same sound, but they usually make it a little more interesting than this.  About half of the songs lack the hooks and power chords they're famous for.  Fantastic album if you're not looking for anything earth shattering aside from the aforementioned songs.  Of course, that's just my opinion.
B00154GEFU|5.0|If there was ever a time or person for this review it is me and it is now. Before I talk about the album. I want to talk about you. The so-called Asia fans. I know we live in a much crueler, hypertensive world nowadays. It often is unbearable for me. I know appreciation of what is always more than merely music is subjective. I will say with great authority, however, that if you did not love this album, then you truly have a different view of not only Asia, their music, but where they take you as a \\"true\\" Asia fan. Think of \\"Without You\\". That song is about love and being with \\"The One\\". No one did/does it better. NO ONE. All their songs are original that NO groups could touch. Every song. Every album. It is apples to oranges always concerning song to song and album to album. I hate comparisons of what is already what you love completely. Now, I too have followed Asia (not from 1982 though). However, I am 33 and was more than old enough in the 80's (by far the best decade, IMHO.) With that said, I did not really discover them until High School in the late 80's when a friend was playing, \\"Then and Now\\". I am sure I had heard \\"Heat\\" at the time, but the first song I heard that night was \\"Wildest Dreams\\" (kind of ironic, but not really as I will explain later). See, I believe we each have a group that speaks and touches our souls more deeply than any other. Like a soul mate they are \\"The One.\\" But to me music is deeper than love and will not abandon you like a woman sometimes does :). Asia is the group that always touched me so deeply and is to this day perfect. If I could create a music group they would be the closest to it. To the reviewer about inevitability of their NOT reuniting and saying otherwise is seemingly lying. I am sorry. But like so many things in my life, I KNEW they would be together again. I never worried. I loved that Geoff kept the Asia name, and I believe sounded so INCREDIBLY well. Did some of you forget about the \\"Aqua\\" album? I mean Steve and Carl contributed very nicely on that first album with Payne. And Steve contributed on two tracks on the \\"Aura\\" album. Have you heard his playing at the end of the song \\"Free\\" on that album? Classic Asia sound. Not to mention his acoustic piece, \\"Ginger\\" was almost added to another \\"Payne-era\\" Asia album. And was added to \\"Anthology\\" (1 or 2?). So Steve has been contributing through the years while he was with Yes/soloing. You didn't notice this? I knew Steve was coming back. And God always opens the right doors at the right times. John and Geoff had already worked together years ago. You had three original members together in the \\"Asia in Asia\\" concert. Geoff and John worked together on more than one occasion even before Icon. Lest you forget they are Christians, and they are wonderful souls. Time was going to heal any supposed wounds. I mean really the rush of 11 months to put together what was to be the \\"Alpha\\" album by a money-hungry music industry did not help and part of the real reason for Steve leaving. Steve says on the reunion website when they first got back together, 'We never really got to know each other well as people outside the whirlwind of music and touring at the time', like he did with Yes. That's what the 80's music industry will do; like they do today with Brittney. Money before people. Therefore, the reunion was going to happen. After I saw Asia at the House of Blues in Cleveland in September 2006, I was the VERY last one to go up to the table to meet and talk/sign with Geoff and Carl. I thanked Geoff for carrying the name and spirit as I see it all these years (without which I don't think this would have all been possible now). And the music and playing Geoff did on the Asia albums with Payne was just awesome to say the least. And personally I love all the Asia albums. All those albums sound like Asia and touch me deeply too because of Geoff's keys, the lyrics and the themes in the songs (war, for example), and it was/is all precious to me.John Payne is VERY good, and I thank him immensely too. I then thanked Carl for his brilliant performance that night. All four are golden, and together they are an element that does not even exist on Earth. Now, I could say a ton more but to get to the new album which is A-1 it's time.           When I listened to the sound bytes, I liked them a lot. Then when I listened to the songs in full over VH-1's site, I absolutely loved them. I was tapping my foot a lot on most every song. I don't want to belittle foot-tapping, because I know it can sound childish. But believe me, I loved that I was doing that. That was something I noticed fully and strongly. I loved it. First album back. Just as the actual reunion itself was not a complete surprise. It's like I know these songs before they were made. That along with the knowing of the reunion going to happen for certain is why I said wildest dreams was not altogether true in the sense I knew it was coming deep in my heart and soul. I have been so blessed with the groups I truly love. More about the album. Two things off the bat. I really love \\"Alibis\\". I think it is an amazingly good song (wonderfully 80'sish with a flair all their own). And the mix on that song is so tight. I only saw one other reviewer say how good it is. I refer to a couple other reviews as I go on here. Yes, keyboards are back on this album with Geoff's awesome solos and ambiance. The reviewer who wrote that knows about Geoff's other work in Asia with as you guys call it the Payne-era. So why say otherwise. It's true what they said. I am a non-conformist and I don't make up labels like that. Geoff has brought the keyboards back into rock with his solos and strong feeds and harmonies that he creates. I love his sound effects and choices too. He never stopped keeping keys alive in rock. God bless him. That's one of the tons of appeals about Asia's sound. But not just any keyboard playing, but Geoff's. I read once that Steve said Geoff has a certain \\"OldEnglish\\" style to his playing. Next, someone said you need Steve more intertwined in the music. Are you kidding me? Steve was all over this album, and was beyond brilliant. Since I think Steve is the best guitarist/musician ever, I was actually praying it would gell together after all the years apart. But I knew in my heart, and know Steve can make anything work as it used to. He's perfect. And the songs, \\"Wish I Had Known All Along\\" (which I really love) and \\"Over and Over\\" are fantastic. When John sings \\"Over and Over\\", I can imagine the lyrics could be sung by Jon Anderson so easily. But then John Wetton goes right back to himself as the lyrics stretch more. It is brilliant. Did you hear the old Asia sound in John's voice when he sings, \\"Whatever I do..\\" on \\"I Will Remember You.\\" God. I loved that. THAT is putting it in a bottle, my friends. That line alone took me right back to Alpha's melodic songs that pierced the heart and were so original. So simple. It's like music was made for them. Not the other way. They are the architects of a sound that will and can never be labeled. \\"Never Again\\" is a classic 80's style that is all Asia and a great song. Steve's playing at the end caps it. His playing throughout was ferocious and just \\"Steve\\" to the nth degree. I don't get how you didn't see how much Steve's playing was pushed up. Thank God. Wasn't that part of the complaint about the Alpha album? The mix. I adore the Alpha album, but come on guys. You were given Steve in fullness here. The three part songs speak for themselves. Simply brilliant in sound and progressiveness, and in the midst tow tapping as well (as I mentioned earlier). One reviewer talked of Asia's ability to give us perfect progressive rock with the right essence of some pop. LOL. Well, I just described it from those songs alone. It was perfect progressive that took you some place, yet also made my tows' tap. And I agree Carl's drumming isn't as much in the forefront in some songs as in the \\"Asia\\" album. But it is evident throughout the album while both strong and more noticeable in other places. Then how about in Vortex? My God. Didn't you hear him then? He crushed like only he can. So did Steve. Guys. Just like on Fanfare, they could illuminate and jam like you would never believe so easily and better than any band, but they have many aspects to their sound they need to tend to. And they need to stay in the Asia arena. I agree with uncorking the songs that have interplay more, which I feel they did very much so here. That is one of their hallmark's is interweaving, but also interplay between Steve and Geoff or Carl (which was very present here). I think you will see even more interplay on the next album. Steve extended solos and I loved that. Keep in mind one last thing. They are not done. There is more to come guys. Believe me. As a matter of fact, because this album sold so well on Amazon (pre-ordering, etc.) and many places and will continue to, they will get more and more recognition. Believe me the word is out already. It already was when they were doing radio interviews in the US on the first tour in '06. Along with the success of their incredible live tours, they WILL make another album. Did you see how good they were on the Webcast (barring the server interruptions) at Turning Stone Casino in Verona, New York on the 15th? God. Steve was so amazing. They better make that concert into a live album. John's singing is truly beautiful. People, you should be so excited. In a world today with so much that has gone bad over time, there still are some perfect gems. Asia is one of those, at least to me. Thank God.
B0016LTNL4|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies my husband and I have watched in a VERY long time.  Between the wonderful English humor and top notch acting your funny bone will be wildly tickled from beginning to end. Recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good giggle and numerous belly laughs!!
B00008BXJG|5.0|I'm not going to waste my time describing this album because I'm pretty sure all AC/DC fans are familiar with it. The thing is that I really don't understand how a reviewer said that this remastered cd sounded bad. The sound is clean and clear. The guitars are more \\"alive\\" than the original cd version. If you don't own a copy, by all means go buy one. Walmart sells all of the Epic remasters for $9.72. I even saw some of them for $8.64.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|This is actually her 1st release and is a few years old--it wasn't available in USA until recently. I think this is the better of her 2 cds. It is absolutely top notch; incredibly amazing to listen to.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am completely transported back in time trough this series. To \\"see\\" Washington, Jefferson and Adams together in a room is thrilling. It has made me even more appreciative of the sacrifices and brilliance that these men with great foresight had. We are truly blessed that THEY were the ones who formed our union and that Lincoln perserved it. I only wish it were possible for them to come  back see what has happened to their Republic . As Benjamin  Franklin said of our republic ...\\" if you can keep it\\".
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Have enjoyed all seven seasons of this great show, and the final one has definitely lived up to my expectations.  I have thoruoughly enjoyed watching it, and would reccommend to any Gilmore Girls fan.
B0017XD3OY|2.0|Will Smith is a terrific actor and gives \\"I Am Legend\\" his best shot but bad editing and over use of computer generated special effects eroded all of his great acting skills.  It is also unrelentingly depressing.  But if you have seen   \\"Omega Man\\" with Charlton Heston you may want to see it just to compare the two movies and the scenes of a deserted Manhattan are admittedly impressive.
B000I2JDEY|4.0|This is a very good film. No doubt great performances by everyone involved. It is also a very uncomfortable film for anyone with any type of alcohol abuse in their family. Quite frankly, ambitious or not, I can't imagine anyone staying more than two minutes in that house with Martha and George. My one complaint is that the film felt very long to me and it might be because of my level of discomfort. The vicious way these two tore into each other and treated it like a game was hard. I'm not saying, by any stretch of the imagination, that it was unrealistic. It's just sad and depressing as all get out. Still, this is definitely a MUST SEE film.
B00132D808|5.0|A very good CD!!! PATD's sound is more mature on their sophomore album. I would recommend this CD to any Panic at the Discs fan or any other person.
B0013FFMOK|5.0|An excellent movie, Will Smith is exceptional in his role, as he is in any movie he makes.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Yay! This is the greatest version of Jane Eyre yet!! WONDERFUL casting... I can't stop raving about this movie! It is great!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|\\"Lonesome Dove\\" is the quintessential western. Its two main characters are the yin and yan of classic tales - one that says little and one that can't shut up. Their exquisitely portrayed relationship - played by Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall - makes you laugh and cry. This is an excellent story that grabs you from the beginning and holds on to the heart-wrenching end. Of all of Larry McMurtry's books, this is probably the best-told tale and this movie version is like they filmed the book, page by page. For all you readers who are consistently disappointed when your favorite book is made into a bad movie - take heart. This time they did it right!
B000OCXGNC|2.0|I'm writing in reference to the Kindle version of this book.  Since I like the book itself, I gave 2 stars; however, this version was lacking in extras.  I was seriously disappointed to find no footnotes, no introduction, no nothing.  Just the book pure and simple.  To top it off, there were many instances of multiple words jammedtogetherlikethis.  I wish the 'sample' had been available when I ordered it from my Kindle.  I certainly would have chosen another one of the available editions.
0618918248|4.0|Just a few comments on Mr. Dawkin's long list of the dangerous consequences of religious thought.    First, I would submit that atheism, rather than theism has resulted in far more human misery and death than theism.  All of the most murderous movements of the 20th century were atheistic movements.  Hitler, Stalin, Mao, the Khumer Rouge, and the Vietnamese Communists all focused on removing religious thought as one of their first actions.  The principal that the state has precidence over the individual was common to all of these movements, and religious theory contradicted this and so had to be removed from public life.    The above political movements, all atheist at their core, resulted in the deaths of at least 100 million people, so although religion has resulted in violence, it would be misleading to leave out the fact that atheistic movements have killed far more people.    The rise of NAZI thought had, in fact, connections to Darwinist thought, eugenics, and its application to human relationships.  And, as opposed to what is commonly said in the media and progressive circles, early on the NAZI party was a progressive, populist movement that was later turned into a state dictatorship.      The NAZI party was a \\"workers party\\", not a right wing party as is commonly believed.  The NAZI party platform included many left wing proposals such as univeral employment, state pensions for all workers, nationalization of major industries, etc.  The NAZI party in its earliest days was competing with the Communist Party for followers.    It is an interesting debate and I hope that neither side tries to silence the other as we try to figure out the meaning of life.    By the way, can Mr. Dawkins explain exactly where energy comes from?  Or why gravity exists?  As a physician and scientist, it seems to me not at all ridiculous to be humbled by the universe and therefore contemplate the existence of a God.    D.Smith, MD
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I love this movie! I thought that it was beautifuly filmed... the whole thing is just lovely! Great chick flick!!
B000UX6TRK|2.0|Beware the dvd has almost all of the audio missing from the left front and left rear channels on the concert footage.  The videos have the audio intact.  This is very disappointing and is almost not worth watching.  We did not watch the disc until it was too late to return it so it will become an expensive coaster.    Lionel Richie should be pissed off and demand that all of those listed here get a new release of the disc with corrected audio.  What do you say Lionel??
B000WMFZMY|4.0|El Cid is a great depiction of Medieval Spain! There is enough violence to satisfy most prurient interests. In addition, the beauty of Sofia Loren, the pageantry and chivalry of the royal court, and the intrigue of familial politics make for a dynamic presentation of the life and times of Spain's greatest hero.   The plot follows the storyline of the \\"Song of the Champion El Cid\\" as it has come down through the centuries. There are a few factual discrepancies but they do not severely hinder the appreciation of the art of this epic.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Brilliant insane comedy! To the people that thought this was the worst movie ever they obviously do not understand British humor. To Kathleen C. Fennessy who initally reviewed this: the scatological scene was pure genious and without a doubt the funniest scene in the movie which both my wife and I cried laughing.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This is such a pretty & sweet little movie, Felicity Jones is amazing!! This may be my favorite Austin movie... (after Pride & Prejudice of course!)
B0010YSD7M|5.0|[[ASIN:B0010YSD7M Stargate - The Ark of Truth]]  It was what I was waiting for after finishing all 10 seasons of SG-1 on DVD.  It finally brought to a conclusion, the TV series.  Well worth the wait.  I enjoyed watching it.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I was looking forward to buying this blu-ray disc and jumped on it when Amazon had it for a great price.  I will say that the production is top quality.  The topics are fascinating and the quality of the video images is absolutely amazing.  My family, wife and three kids (8,11and 12)love to watch the episodes together.  I highly reccommend this to anyone!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I ordered this cd back in January 08 out of curiosity--had read great reviews of both this and Neon Bible but had hever actually heard anything by them.  I honestly was blown away.  This is the best cd on the whole that I have ever heard. The packaging actually came with 2 cd's so I gave the extra one to my sister and told her I heard they were good.  Two days later she emails me to tell me it was her new favorite cd.  My only regret was that I caught on to them too late to catch them on tour for Neon Bible (which I immediately bought and is also 5 stars). I just received the debut EP and can't wait to get to know it.  If you're on the fence about these guys or just curious, do yourself a favor and order something by them.  They are incredible.
B0006ZFQP8|5.0|Be advised that 'Tristan und Isolde' is probably one of the top ten greatest works in the history of western music. So you can understand why there are so many recordings and so many disparate preferences as to which is \\"best\\" or \\"greatest\\".    This recording is the one and only recording I own. I'm not a recording addict, so I doubt I'll buy another. I've had it since it debuted way back in the 80's.     This recording is wonderful. I like the clarity of this modern recording above the older ones (I'm sure they are great, too, but the poor sound is hard to get past). You can't go wrong with this one.

I recommend you to read this book, because you will definitely enjoy it.
B00154GEFU|2.0|Well, after 23 years since I last saw the original incarnation of ASIA, I was expecting that this four masterful musicians would come up with something better than the pop soaked albums they released in the '80's. Alas, no. What we get is even worst, with the exception of the last 5 songs on the album. The cd is worth getting just for song #8 \\"Parallel Worlds\\", which is a masterpiece. The two Steve Howe songs are excellent, showing that his songwriting is essential in this band, and \\"Orchard of Mines\\" is an excellent haunting song. \\"An Extraordinay Life\\" will stay in your head after you've listened to it. Now, the rest of the album is embarrasing to say the least. \\"Never Again\\" sounds so 80's, it's ridiculous. The only thing I like about this song is the lyrics, but the music is awful. The rest of the songs are like the Wetton/Downes Icon albums, which are supposed to be albums for songs that doesn't really fit the Asia mold. How in the world these superb musicians in their 60's can come with these ridiculous songs such as \\"Alibi\\"? Again, I was expecting a more mature progressive oriented album, but I only got that in the last 5 songs in this cd, which is not bad. The problem is that the rest of the cd is so awful, I just did not believe I was hearing this. I mean, any of the John Payne era cd's is a 'Dark Side of the Moon' or a 'In the Court of the Crimson King' or a 'Yes Album' compared to this. I guess I'll listen this cd from track 8 'til 12 and that's it. Still waiting for this band to realize it's full potential. More \\"Parallel Worlds\\" and \\"Wish I'd Known All Along\\" and less \\"No Way Back\\" please next time around guys.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|This was exactly what we needed for our Graco Ipo umbrella stroller. I had just purchased our new umbrella stroller for easy use through Disneyland Park but I also wanted to find something that would hold a drink. Perfect! It fit perfectly between the separated handles and held my sons sippy cup, my drink cup, as well as our camera and snacks for my son. I was able to use it with bottled water, drink cups with lids and sippy cups. It was super easy to put on, and super easy to take off and fold compactly. I had looked at other stroller cup holders but this one offered the stability to hold more than just a bottled water. The open area between drinks left it for easy access to the camera and snacks and other small junk we collected along the way. I couldn't have asked for a better little accessory to my new stroller. Also, shipping to California from NY was super fast-ordered it Thursday received it Monday. Yeah!

B00008RH3L|2.0|This is not a great movie.<br /><br />I watched [[ASIN:B000V3JGII The Coen Brothers Movie Collection (Fargo / Miller's Crossing / Barton Fink / Raising Arizona / Blood Simple)]] Blood Simple for the first time a few weeks ago and really enjoyed watching Francis McDermott. She was fantastic in Fargo. Fargo was a great movie with all the right moves, excellent tone, bizarre characters, and a flatly affected but very strong pregnant cop played by McDermott. The Coen brothers are known for their slightly off-kilter films. Raising Arizona with Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter was a very successful and entertaining quirky movie. Strange characters and bizarre situations can be very entertaining. The formula just doesn't work in Miller's Crossing.<br /><br />Garbrial Byrne stars as a dirtball gangster. He's the slimey no. 2 to Albert Finney in Finney's massive gangster world. Finney is the real power in this mystery city and Byrne's authority and power comes from only the fact that he has Finney's confidence. Finney is the star of the movie for me. In this unnamed city, the mayor and the police chief are in his pocket until his rival \\"goes to war\\" with his gang and starts to get the upper hand.  Byrne is having a \\"liaison\\" with Albert Finney's galpal played ably by Marcia Gay Harden. Byrne is Finney's second in command, so his choice of girlfriend is highly questionable. Over the course of the convoluted plot and where dirtbags of all stripes show up and do their thing, Byrne is forced to kill a man to show his new pals that he is not a mole or traitor. Well, Byrne has a little itty bitty heart and lets the pathetic victim go so long as he disappears from town. The intended victim is his girlfriend's brother so it makes sense not to whack him.<br /><br />Byrne makes his way between the two warring gangs all the while trying to get some money to pay off his gambling debts. It's all really quite silly and meaningless. There are lots of false deep moments with characters pretending to have souls and more than one layer to their shallow characters but they can't quite pull it off. This is a movie populated with characters who are all essentially the same, completely corrupt-- with little or no ethics or care for anybody else but themselves.<br /><br />The main problem with quirky films is that they so often end badly. What I mean is that the filmmakers don't quite know how to conclude the story or they purposefully leave the ending obscure just so they can retain their \\"quirky\\" reputations.<br /><br />Why is it seen as something of a failure in modern hollywood films to properly conclude a story? At one time, this was considered the mark of a well-constructed story--  one that has a beginning, middle, and end. Some \\"artists\\" apparently find the concept unfulfilling and perhaps even a bit constricting-- well, I want a proper ending to my stories! Why should the audience have to make up their own endings? It's just lazy story-telling disquised as avant-garde \\"art\\".<br /><br />The ending in this movie was completely frustrating. Nothing was wrapped up for the main characters (except those that got whacked) and what seems like a perfectly reasonable option presented to Byrne at the closing is rejected by him for no apparent reason. Finney's character doesn't quite understand the ending and neither do I. But Byrne is apparently motivated by other character traits that unfortunately nobody in the audience knows anything about.<br /><br />Folks in this movie don't learn alot, and don't change alot. It's just another \\"slice of life\\" in this particular weird, bizarro Coen brothers world.<br /><br />The film is beautiful to watch with lush dark colors everywhere. Everybody is wan and pale and even the scenery is washed out. The direction is excellent and the pacing fine. The performances are all adequate or better, but it's just not enough. The dialogue is stilted and terse. Albert Finney owns this movie and so does Marcia Gay Harden.<br /><br />Essentially, this approach to filmmaking and story telling is a treat for the filmmakers but a frustration for the audience. At the end of the movie I want to know what happens next, I want the storyline concluded, and I don't want to waste my time guessing and speculating about what happens to the characters after the credits because I really just don't care enough about the film or the shallow one or two dimensional characters to waste my time on the exercise.for the filmmakers but a frustration for the audience.

B0009S2T0M|1.0|The great composer Gustav Mahler reportedly once said, in reference to his contemporary Puccini, \\"These days any idiot can orchestrate to perfection.\\" I happen to love Puccini, but I think I understand the point Mahler was trying to make, that an artist can be technically proficient, a master craftsman in fact, and still create art that is slick, soulless and pedantic. This idea applies as much to film as it does to music. To paraphrase Mahler, \\"These days any idiot can edit to perfection.\\" He can cut, paste, slice and dice, pan and scan with the best of them, he can rearrange his narrative so that it becomes a complicated jigsaw that the viewer has to invest some mental effort in putting back together, but that doesn't necessarily make him a great director. Oldboy is proof positive. Now, I don't mean to suggest that Chan-Wook Park is an idiot, I just think he's the kind of artist Mahler was talking about, a master craftsman whose film is slick, soulless and pedantic.    Past masters such as Ingmar Bergman and Luis Bunuel made obligue, complex pictures as well, cinematic puzzles so to speak, the kind a viewer has to think about before he can reach understanding, but the puzzle isn't so much about what happens onscreen, it involves piecing together what the film is ABOUT. Take Bergman's Through A Glass Darkly for example. The narrative part of the film is linear and straightforward, any ten-year-old watching the film could tell you what happens, the sequence of events, but could he tell you what it all means? The beauty of Through A Glass Darkly is its ability to make the viewer grow while watching it, make him contemplate his own feelings about God, family, relationships, spirituality, madness and art, and in effect he has the opportunity of becoming a more thoughtful and self-aware person via the experience. Does anybody really think that the decadent-for-its-own-sake Oldboy could have that kind of an impact on its viewership? Park's film is all about confusing theaudience in a far less meaningful way, making the viewer work to reconstruct its fractured storyline, which to me is a more shallow form of complexity. That might sound like an oxymoron but it certainly applies. I'm not denying there's a message to the film, that obsessing over vengeance can turn a civilized person into a beast, into his own worst enemy, but that concept alone is hardly new or earth-shattering considering that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet centuries ago. A film that wants to pass itself off as great art needs more than that to qualify as substantive, instead, Oldboy uses its thematic pretensions, as well as its edgy, hyperkinetic editing, its swallowing orchestral motifs, its off-putting violence and depravity, in short its self-conscious artiness to distract the viewer from its nonsensical plot.    Be warned, the following paragraph contains spoilers, but since the purpose of this review is to dissuade potential viewers, the spoilers don't really matter. The story of Oldboy is basically a comic book plot blown up to pseudo-artistic proportions. It involves an absurd villain who blames the death of his sister on a fellow student from their high school years, but instead of confronting the guy years later, maybe punching him out, or holding a gun to his head and saying, \\"You ruined my life, you scumbag!,\\" he comes up with an elaborate plan to carry out his vengeance that involves kidnapping the man, holding him prisoner in an apartment for fifteen years, hypnotizing him, murdering the man's wife and framing his victim for the crime, hypnotizing the man's daughter while financing a cover-up that leads the man to believe that the young woman is living in Switzerland, all this so that by the time the man escapes the daughter will be old enough, and unfamiliar, for him to unknowingly sleep with her!(Of course she also happens to be beautiful and sensual, a plain, sexless daughter would have very little use in the film, although I suppose the villain could have anonymously financed her plastic surgery, he manages to do everything else!) The reason for all this? While in high school, the man inadvertently started a rumor(which by the way is true) that the villain and his sister had sex. His crime was talking too much around the wrong people, as high school boys are wont to do. Anyone who thinks that the folks who appear on the Maury Show to confront bullies from their past need to get a life should take a serious look at this guy! He makes No Country For Old Men's Anton Chigurh seem like a subtle, realistic, and down-to-earth baddie by comparison. Of course our dastardly fiend has unlimited resources at his disposal, as all comic book villains do, he has wealth, a bodyguard, an army of thugs, access to hypnotists, hallucinatory gases, numerous penthouse apartments, revolutionary surveillance devices and other convenient technology, everything he needs to carry out his mad scheme, plus a heartlessness that allows him to exploit and maim and destroy(in some very gruesome sequences I might add, gruesome to the point of being almost unwatchable) until his vengeance is complete. All of this is presented in a style that is very garish and over-the-top, which is necessary, otherwise the viewer might think too much and recognize the preposterousness of it all. The prisoner becomes just as hungry for revenge, blurring the lines between good and evil but not in any way that is convincing, because Chan-Wook Park isn't interested in presenting us with a serious examination of violence and its causes, he's more interested in indulging his deranged imagination.    Modern film, television as well, has fallen in love with this in-your-face style of filmmaking, with circuitous storylines(here a twist, there a twist, everywhere a twist twist), graphic yet stylized gore, frenetic pacing and hallucinatory editing, but with little if any substance, and this is what passes for \\"smart.\\" \\"These days any idiot can orchestrate to perfection.\\" I hear ya, brother. I think I liked the old days better.

B000F3UAFC|5.0|During the last few years while Hollywood was immersed in their orgy of films that celebrate violence, death and destruction three small European companies got together and hired a gifted writer to adapt Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, for those who may not be familiar, a much heralded stage drama (a Comedy of manners as it was then called) first presented in the London stage in 1892.<br /><br />Here is story containing much of the original, brilliant wit of Oscar Wilde.  Here is a lovely cast of carefully selected, talented actors and here is a motion picture every bit as filmic as anything yet done, re-set at the 1930 seaside village of Amalfi, Italy, a watering place for the rich in pre-Hitler Europe.<br /><br />The period is lovingly restored perhaps only in the ways of Italian craftsmen in costume, architecture, ambiance and even camera film tone.  This care extended to the performances by actors we all recognize and admire; Helen Hunt, here, surprisingly beautiful, Tom Wilkinson and Scarlett Johansson.<br /><br />The film was not really seen here although apparently released theatrically.  Why not is puzzling and why the critics did not like it while they go bonkers over junk is far beyond my ken.<br /><br />Fortunately I saw the entire movie on Comcast's On Demand completely free of breaks and commercials on my large Sony Bravia.  For two hours I was in heaven with my cup of coffee and a cinnamon-raisin bagel from Brueggers' downstairs.  If you want to escape to what surely was a more graceful time of letters and human behavior please get a hold of the DVD which is available at this writing.

B0009S5AEE|3.0|Compared to nothing, perhaps this book gets four stars, but you just can't be objective about the writer of the classic book \\"Getting Things Done.\\"  This little book is a very fine accomplishment, easy to read, and packed with great advice.  The quotes which also litter this book from other writers, philosophers, etc, are excellent - it's almost worth reading the book just for those quotations.    After finishing the book, I thought, \\"good, but not great..\\" so I guess I'm sticking with that initial reaction.  One of the best things about this book is it's length.  It's short.  Right to the point, not a lot of fluff nor repetition of the same ideas.  It's easy to read in one sitting, and I think I'll end up reading it several times.  I usually wait until the second or third reading to make a complete judgment on a book, so I'm wagering that this one may rise in stature after a couple of more reads.  I'll also say it was well worth the price I paid for it - I bought the hardcover at Building #19 for $2.98.

0374105235|5.0|A Long Way Gone is one of the few books I have read in one sitting.  This memoir is a glimpse of what is happening under our noses in the world during the last decade.  Too often isolated from unreported terrors and the horrors of civil war, Beah tells a frightful first hand account of a life filled with desparation brought on by the will to just survive.  The book erases any illusions that children of war torn regions live with the security found in the west.  While not explicitly stated, the book in the end is a reality check on one's worldview.
B000YABYLA|3.0|Yes, it's all very cute.  The neighborhoods, the people, the blue drinks, and so on--cute as heck and really adorable and sometimes funny. But believable?  No, not quite.   I couldn't believe that Juno went back with Paulie at the end and that they sat there singing a happy song as if nothing serious had happened in their young lives.  It was hard to believe that Juno would actually make a phone call about getting an abortion and then scare herself off just because of the thought that the baby had fingernails already.  I couldn't believe that Juno's dad and stepmother were so cool with the whole thing.  That's not the normal reaction from most people in such a situation.    The music got on my nerves as well.  Every five frakking minutes, there was another off-key indie song being sung.  It was quite annoying after a while.    Was there a reason for Liberty Bell to be in the movie at all?  She was basically a piece of furniture.    RE: the dialogue:  okay, sarcastic and self-aware and snappy is fun for a few minutes.  I'm sure it was fun to write.  But come on....do people talk that way that frequently?   I couldn't believe that either.    Into the Wild deserved a nomination far more than this film did.
055358894X|5.0|This was a wonderful very non-traditional fantasy populated by great characters that were none of them perfect or even completely likable. The main character is an acknowledged thief, killer and conman that in a different context might have been the villain of the story. The story took place in the seedy underworld, a place that is usually only hinted at or ignored in most other fantasies. This is a story populated by the ordinary folk who were not born to power. Magic did not win the day; sheer chutzpah did. This was a wonderful fantasy which I highly recommend to anyone who wants something different than the normal sword and sorcery.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|For me to give a 5-star rating to any Jim Carrey movie, before I saw this 1, I'd say you'd see the sun rise in the west first; or see Bush become a Christian!   Very very small-the ending, kind of leaves 1 hanging; especially with Natascha's character when she rejoices over Carrey's choice and throws on her coat and runs out the door, where's she going? To him?   But for what the movie is and attempts to accomplish, BRAVO x 1000. To qualify, for people who are not into a surreal brand of movie, without question, avoid this one!  Ed Harris' character Christof? Like Carrey's, bravo! A little malevolent, at the end when he tells Truman to choose to stay; is it love, or control? Masterfully played! And Laura Linney, always outstanding. Natascha McElhone? First roll I've seen her in but, as with Harris and Carrey, very poignantly played!    Some of the philosophical questions attacked, interestingly enough, are issues, and choices, America is contending with today.  What is it we're seeking? security, with the known and totally controlled, or the adventure of the unknown, freedom, and exploration?  How do we define sickness? completely controlling a human being's life for ratings, or the rest of the world itself gone completely mad with rising crime and a government we don't seem to be able to control any more, and an apathetic spirit which chooses to just disengage?  Is it sick/wrong for the network or corporation or whomever it is to claim ownership over Truman, in an obvious capacity, when in a more invidious one we delusionally call ourselves free today at the same time government has virtually reduced us to slaves?  What is it Goethe says, \\"None are more easily enslaved than those who call their slavery freedom\\"? Truman's mistake-discovering the game; when are we? If you like movies like \\"V For Vendetta\\" you'll like this 1 too.  A++++++
B000BYA5GE|2.0|Nick Cage's 2006 drama \\"Lord of War\\" collapses into oblivion the notion that contemporary Hollywood makes interesting movies.  Although Cage gives this plot-less dud an admirable (sometimes funny-sometimes serious) performance.  This anti-gun movie trips over itself to become anti-movie movie.<br /><br />In almost everyway this movie misses the mark trying to make a point.  There are so many poignant opportunities but, alas, all are ignored.  The producers simply didn't get an idea.  Also, there is hardly anything original with \\"Lord of War\\" (same old guns are bad clich&eacute;s, the usual Africa is only a place of war and AIDs, and the typical American laws and authorities must be ignored for good to prevail, blah, blah, blah...).  Is Cage really this anti-American?<br /><br />Everyone knows arms dealing is bad, so why not address issues that will help to end it?  This movie doesn't say anything except that the evil United States is the world's largest arms merchant.  One is left to wonder, because a plot doesn't ensue to bring home any point, \\"so what?\\"<br /><br />It seems that the American motion picture industry has lost it way.  Too bad, there are a huge variety of original opportunities for screenplays.  People want to go to the movies.  But, with odd flicks like this one emerging, there's no theater-going incentive.<br /><br />Don't bother with \\"Lord of War\\"... Cage is much better in his other recent work (National Treasure 1 & 2, etc).  Someone tell me, when will Hollywood make good movies again?

B00154GEFU|5.0|PHOENIX, the first album by the original lineup of the 80s supergroup Asia in 25 years, is a powerful piece of work intertwining love ballads that are excellent nonprescription tranquilizers with rockers that convey a message of \\"Carpe Diem\\", or \\"Seize the Day\\", which was a mantra that I used to look good for some young women I knew in Connecticut during the 90s. Some of the lyrics were exactly the same as I worded my promises to these girls, so the album has a familiar feel to it. The opening track, \\"Never Again\\" could alternately be interpreted as someone swearing or affirming that they'll never nominate someone they call a friend for a show such as WHAT NOT TO WEAR and as someone saying they want to move on from their past altogether, the latter theme present through many of the songs here, which was, for me, why I chose to skip my old school's food-related reunions after 1994 to look good for the girls I was close with in Connecticut, and later to look good for my favorite actresses. Overall, this is a great, deeply-felt album from one of the best bands to come out of the 80s, and the band members' opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes PHOENIX an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000Y8GFY8|5.0|I have been a longtime Goldfrapp fan since I first heard FELT MOUNTAIN when it first came out several years ago. Although their next two albums are complete contrasts to their sensuous debut album with their infectious electro-pop sounds, I still loved the duo of Allison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory. Long before the duo's latest effort SEVENTH TREE came out, I knew that the duo had toned down the dance beats for this album.<br /><br />A lot of people try to compare SEVENTH TREE to FELT MOUNTAIN. While the album is more laidback like FELT MOUNTAIN, SEVENTH TREE does not share the same orchestral qualities that permeates FELT MOUNTAIN. With FELT MOUNTAIN, I felt like I was listening to an Ennio Morricone film score with Shirley Bassey on vocals, and an occasional collaboration with Portishead. Here on SEVENTH TREE, the music is more contemporary trip hop. I personally love SEVENTH TREE the lush, catchy melodies, Allison's smooth vocals, and downtempo electronic beats. I think it is a good thing that Goldfrapp doesn't try to get stuck in a rut with one particular sound. That would get awfully boring to put out a regurgitated version of either FELT MOUNTAIN or SUPERNATURE. Some people might not like the change but I love it.

B000YKE87W|5.0|Several years ago I had the pleasure of attending a recital Jonas Kaufmann gave in Munich. I had heard about his superb interpretation of Strauss Lieder and when I finally had my ears filled by his compelling voice a sense of revelation and inspiration totally consumed me. Kaufmann's singing of these 'Romantic Arias' conveys such an unequivocal direction of line and beauty of conception. The voice is deep and has the rich, darker quality of a baritone, yet the eloquence he produces is substantial and his range vast, consequently allowing him to attain long-breathed generosity in the middle and higher tenor register. This ability is gloriously conveyed in Massenet's \\"Manon\\", ingratiating in tone and pleasingly articulate. As well, Kaufmann provides innate dramatic sensibility and poetically nuanced dynamics especially in the extremely high notes. In Wagner's \\"Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg...\\" Kaufmann's operatic grandeur provides us with singing that is radiant, exhilarating and never denying the incandescence of the climaxes. Verdi's \\"La traviata\\" tended to lack the necessary light-hearted character in the aria, but without doubt the \\"Flower Song\\" from Carmen opens Kaufmann's soul. The phrases have both elegance and intensity, producing a touch of sensuousness in the tone. His gentle pacing of the long ascending finale makes for a spiritual encounter. Kaufmann is, as ever, admirable in the quality of his tone, the clarity of his diction and the conviction of his style. He is a remarkably gifted artist, yet the voice is still young, and Kaufmann is indeed striving to find placement and a sense of future direction, as his personal musical journey continues to captivate us with grandeur, artistic maturity, and anticipation of future magnificant accomplishments.<br /><br /> \\"It is only a matter of time before Jonas Kaufmann will take his place as one of the world's finest tenors!\\"<br />(Jon Vickers)<br /><br />Author: Raymond Vacchino M.Mus.

B000000WG4|5.0|Mike Oldfield probably owes his career to film director Billy Friedkin, who doesn't even like \\"Tubular Bells\\" very much, and who has never even met Oldfield, for that matter. While the 1973 smash film \\"The Exorcist\\" was in its final stages of production, suitable music wasn't yet selected, as nothing seemed to fit the mood of the piece. It was either too much bombast, or too cliche'd, never quite right. The then unknown record company called Virgin Records had some music in their vault, so Friedkin was listening to some of their unknown material, looking for something the public hadn't heard before, and something with an eerie, almost child's music box sound. He found \\"Tubular Bells\\" to be very boring and pointless, to paraphrase, but the opening motif was exactly what he wanted. Whether by association in hindsight, or just the way people think, the piano intro, with the other arrangements (bass, and keyboard and percussion accents) carries this other-worldly feel, something sinister and forboding, a tension that very few other pieces have ever achieved successfully. And the rest is history. This is Mike Oldfield's first official release, and the first of several incarnations of this piece. It seems he was always trying to find the right way to communicate this idea.<br /><br />Remarkable is the fact that he played all the instruments himself, save for some of the voices, a flute arrangement, and the drums. Yes, it is self-indulgent, but that is often the best performance art. Knowing if one puts his or her all into something, and has the talent to do it, it WILL be good. The listener is transported from the ominous opening theme to a lighter dimension, a postcard-like image to a hillside occupied with a small town on a late Autumn dusk or dawn. I am imposing my own mind's eye on you here, but this is what I experience with it. This is very subjective, everyone will have their own experience, so pushing my personal images off on others could taint someone else's view. I will try to keep this to a minimum. Various themes play out, some sounding more finished than others, but the segue is as much an instrument as the actual instruments themselves.<br /><br />The first act, if you will, climaxes with a repetitive rhythm from an electric bass or muted electric six-string guitar, laying down an established groove, if you will, adding a new instrument each time. The instruments are introduced one at a time by Vivian Stanshall of the Bonzo Dog Band (\\"I'm The Urban Spaceman\\"), until the creshendo is reached with \\"...Plus; Tubular Bells!...\\" The bottom the falls out, and a moment of silence ensues.<br /><br />In the old days, this would be where you would go get a drink and flip the record over.<br /><br />Act Two, I believe, contains an opening sequence which is every bit as ominous as the piano theme Friedkin used in his movie. The first reworking of it has this passage titled \\"Weightless,\\" and that is fitting there, but in this original 1973 record, it is simply frightening. Instead of playing standard guitar notes, a technique called \\"fretboard harmonics\\" is used to lay down the groundwork as nylon and steel string guitars play the melody over top, accentuated with female (or male falsetto) vocals chanting some ethereal melody you would hear in a fever-induced dream. Once again, my own lexicon trumps the readers' perception, unless they have a powerful one of their own, but dark, gritty, monochrome black-and-white imagery of bare trees and something simply being not right pervades. This gives way to a more peaceful, gentle mood, actually sounding a little sad, with an innocence to it, completely belying what preceded it.<br /><br />...relax for a few moments...<br /><br />Once again, this soundscape is painted with bold strokes, as distorted guitars sounding like bagpipes swirl over tympani, playing some foreboding melody in a loop, while some mis-shapen ogre is pursuing you. A plodding rock rhythm is the background  for an interesting vocal by Oldfield himself, the \\"Piltdown Man,\\" as the credits say. Primal rage is building, and the terrifying howl that ensues actually put a cold chill down my back the first time I heard it. This segment is one of the most aggressive pieces in most record collections from the era, a genuinely scary performance.<br /><br />Screams, howls, violence, and rage, give way to quiet darkness; points of light in the distance, a la early Pink Floyd, trailing off into oblivion, but a little postscript is appended to the very end, a little sea shanty, if you will, a reminder to not take it TOO seriously, it's just a piece of music.<br /><br />And, what a good piece of music it is.Man,\\" as the credits say.

B0013FBS20|1.0|I like Will Smith, who doesn't?!  I wanted this film to be a hit but it is a dull film. It looks wonderful on Blu-ray!  Will Smith has not got much to do in the film and his performance is weak.  CGI is not as awful as alot of reviewers have said but it's not the best either.   Uninteresting  plot and the story is not engaging, I really didn't care what happened to anyone at the end.  The Blu-ray disk has an alternative ending.  Very  disappointing.

They all agreeded that they were delicious.  The book has so many great pictures and clear directions.  I can hardly wait to try another recipe.  Thanks, Martha, for a great book!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat (at least if you are a Science Fiction fan).  The crew is composed of people of all types...brave and no so brave, loyal and (?).  All have their reasons fo being there.  All are trying to stay alive and no be caught by the Central Powers.  Because of mishandling by FOX (%!*#$#&) the series was cancelled after one season.  It was followed by a movie \\"Serenity\\" which was the name of their spaceship on Firefly.  Not as optomistic as Star Trek, but looks at a smaller piece of the future where people live, not just at the exploraion of the unknown.  I highly recommend this video.
0312360266|3.0|This is the story of Zoey redbird and her life at a vampyre finishing school.  She leaves her normal high school when she is marked as destined to become a vampyre, or die trying.    The idea for this book is creative and intriguing.  The writing and story however are less so.  The story is hindered by the repetitive warnings of the author in not so subtle manors.  We get it! don't wear a lot of black eye liner, homophobes are horrible, black and white people should get along, don't be shallow, and girl power are all messages that are impossible not to get out of this book.  Not because they are shown in a memorable fashion or alluded at with examples.  No, no, no, we should only be so lucky.  Instead they are told to us, over and over.  Although it takes more creativity it would be much more influential if they were wound into the story rather than stated like a blaring Public service announcement every few pages.  And in case you were wondering you'll get the same fun messages in the next two books as well.    If you can put that aside and focus on the story it is a good book.  Being patient with the repetition and overlooking the obvious shot and a miss and generically creating teen slang and conversation, is a bit of a task but if you do then you can get a quite enjoyable idea of how great this concept really could have been.
0440241413|5.0|This is a wonderful start to a great series.  I literally laughed out loud while reading it.  If you are looking for some fun and easy reading, this is a great choice!
0385338724|1.0|I seem to be the only person who didn't like this book.  This book was very disappointing for me.  I didn't like that the book made it seem like it was okay for Lexi to be cheating on her husband, and that at the end she leaves her husband to be with her lover.  I have loved all of Sophie Kinsella's other books.  I like that they are light and easy to read.  This is the only one of her books I have not liked.  I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't.
0156421178|4.0|This is one of the most complete and well-thought-out reports of the Spanish Civil War written in the English language.  Considering the importance of international fighters in the war (debatable, but certainly in a political sense, noteworthy), and the effect of the war on socialist myth in the latter half of the 20th century, it is a book not to be missed by anyone interested in either World War II, modern socialism, communism, and/or anarchy, Spain, or George Orwell.<br /><br />The personal narrative was wonderful and typically vivid Orwell.  His complaints about the politics going on behind the scenes, however, were sometimes dull.  He admits (repeatedly) that he is biased and perhaps does not know all of what is going on.  However, after reading _The Battle for Spain_, I got the sense that his complaining was actually very revealing from an historical perspective.<br /><br />I read _Homage to Catalonia_ and then _The Battle for Spain_ to get a basic idea about the Spanish Civil War, which I had previously known mainly through punk-rock songs and revolutionary anthem anthologies.  I wish I had read them the other way around, though.  Although I think this book is indispensable for English-speaking people to understand the Spanish Civil War, it is also a narrow view and very biased (as most works on the subject are).  If it were anyone else, my expectations would be lower and I would probably have given it five stars.  But compared to other Orwell works (including _Down and Out_) I would give it four.
B00122M2QU|4.0|Sepultura was heavy back in the day when both Max & Igor Cavalera were in the group....but Max left after some tension in the band became apparent & Soulfly was born & eventually became even heavier than Sepultura. However, here we are many years later & the Cavalera brothers recently reunited & man it makes you wonder what took them so long to get back together again! Obviously Max & Igor had to work out their problems with each other & their past with Sepultura, but man while you are listening to this CD you can't help but wonder if making this CD was truly therapy for the both of them! This CD is NON-STOP brutality from start to finish & definitely angrier than anything I've heard from Max Cavalera & that's saying a lot because Max is always pissed about something! Buy this CD for some straight forward/heavy/no nonsense metal! Thank God the Cavalera boys are back!

B00104QSOM|5.0|Watching There Will Be Blood is definently an interesting experience. I can't quite put my finger on it but there is just something so hypnotic about this film that, from the very first scene, you can't help but become oddly entranced by it all. From the almost silent fifteen first minutes to the strangely engrossing oil scenes, the slighty hysteric rantings of crazed young preacher Eli, even the almost curve ball final act, you can't help want to see more and more of the film and when it does end, you leaves you sitting there, almost tempted to want to rewatch the film all over again. Again, I can't figure out what it was but whatever it is, it just leaves you with that satisfied movie going experience.<br /><br />We are taken into the life of the charasmatic and slightly eccentric Daniel Plainview, who describes himself as a professional oil man. Already having made a impressive buisness of himself, he is approached by a young man who gives him a tip that the town he lives in may have a vast underground oil supply. Seeing the opportunity at hand, he packs up his equipment and with his son H.W. in tow, sets off for the small town with great intentions in mind. Along the way, he makes himself a rival in the form of Eli Sunday, twin brother of the boy who gave Daniel the tip off. A overbearing bible thumper, he has the same intentions of greatness as Daniel and as the movie goes on, there rivalry slowy grow as they try to make their goals into reality.<br /><br />First thing is first, all the acting is definently on par. Paul Dano (probally best known from his role in Little Miss Sunshine) brings a fire and intensity to his characters, his big scenes never boarding as over the top or zanny but just the right amount of fantatasism and passion. And as for Daniel Day Lewis, a very well known character actor with some pretty odd methods of preparing for a role, once again submerges himself into this role. He spits fire, his eyes burn with intensity, never does his performance go over to the hammy side, which in a role like this could have very easily went over the top. Oscar worthy, definently.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson has always been a personal favorite of mine, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, both super diffrent films and each one so very diffrent in there own mind, and each on effective in their purpose. This was his much needed comeback film after the pretty average Punch Drunk Love, once again taking care in his work and producing an engrossing story that has you hooked from the beginning. Everything else is also great, Cinematography just pops, Art Direction is just the right amount of grit, everything in this film comes together.<br /><br />My one main critisism would probally have to be that this film may have been a bit to over hyped. Reading reviews, I've probally glimpsed the word 'Masterpiece' used in almost every single one. I wouldn't go to far as to call this film a masterpiece, I could probally name about twenty other films in the past eight years that can easily out surpass this film in terms of quality and impact. It kind of suffered the same effect as No Country for Old Men, but unlike the later film which I felt was severly overrated, this one actually deserved most of its praise.<br /><br />Other then that, it's definantly one of the films to see from 2007.

B000008LOV|5.0|Item shipped quickly. This is my first \\"used\\" CD purchase and I was a little nervous. The CD plays beautifully and the price was RIGHT! Excellent seller.
B000H1RFKU|4.0|Enjoyed the quality of our first Blue Ray HD movie.  Didn't care much for the story line -- a little too violent and weird, especially for a Denzel Washington movie.  Yes, it said he didn't play a good buy in this one, but even forewarned, thought it was over the top.
B000F7CMRW|1.0|This movie tried to be the \\"wall street\\" of the oil industry.  In one scene a character makes a statement about corruption keeping the economy moving, and how important corruption was. All I could think of was the \\"greed is good\\" scene from Wall street.  I was expecting much from this movie, waiting for something good to happen, and really it never did. I could care less about the characters so the ending was very ho hum for me.  If it was based on true events it would be much more interesting.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Love it! Songs are amazing!!! I'm glad I bought the deluxe edition. It has more of the songs not included on the regular version that are amazing!
B001152TL6|5.0|I really enjoy Lost Highway and have been waiting years for this 2008 DVD release.  I avoided buying the previous 'import' version due to the explicit consumer complaints regarding the quality of the transfer.  My potential concerns regarding sound and picture quality were allayed upon viewing this new U.S. release.  It looks and sounds quite good, bearing in mind the source material.  The visual style of the film is sparse, simple, and high-contrast -- rendered with Lynch's \\"vague America\\" aesthetic.  The image maintains its integrity and the deep blacks employed do not suffer from noise often seen in older or poor transfers; the colors are also solid for a DVD.  The sound design is suitably moody, ambient, dark, evocative, provocative, and intersperses a fairly eclectic mixture of songs with the invaluable contributions of composer Angelo Badalamenti.  There can be a slightly irritating difference in volume between Patricia Arquette's near-whispering and, say, Rammstein -- but this is not an uncommon problem with DVDs.  Otherwise it sounds pretty cool.<br />I'm not going to review the film but I will say the complete lack of special features is more forgivable for such an unusual, ambiguous, and artistic film as Lost Highway than any other movie I can think of right now.  I tend to view this film the way I view abstract art: explanation is not only unwarranted but also largely undesirable.  In other words, special features could be intriguing but I hardly miss them for a movie like Lost Highway.
B0001932ZA|5.0|It was a very quick delivery (within two weeks) and very cheap for two dvd's. Fantastic movie.
B0012QE4OY|1.0|I'm not the only person who saw the cultural insensitivity of this movie! I think it's in \\"fluff pieces\\" where stereotypes are particularly dangerous: The story claimed that it wanted to showcase how dance and hip-hop transcend cultural and class divisions, but it only served to highlight and exploit these barriers. I hold the writers more responsible for this missed opportunity than the director, though. A few simple plot changes could have given the storyline the level of emotional intelligence that even a cartoon deserves.  It's easy to believe that observations like this will fall on deaf ears, but I hope that people (in audiences and in the movie industry) will be more considerate before they decide to patronize such ignorance.
0316174483|5.0|Great craft ideas for preschoolers through grade school.  Make sure to have the washable stamp pads ready for when the book arrives.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Not being a proffesional reviewer all I know is this film was the culmination of a sensational piece of entertaiment plus!! It's a non stop adventure ride with all the twists and turns of a great storyline. The casting of Matt Damon was a stroke of genius. The last film was probably the most exilerating. When I need a night of pure escapism sitting down and watching the Bourne saga is the perfect medicine. I LOVE IT!!!

B0010YSD7M|3.0|Having been a fan for 10 seasons I was really expecting a sensational end. Although enjoyable, and it did tie up a lot of loose ends, it didn't quite have the spark that I had hoped for. It all ended up a bit washed out. You could really see that the producers and writers had run out of steam and had really nothing more to tell. The performances of the cast also gave the impression that they were glad it was over.   As with all things somewhere it has to come to an end, but for 10 years what a ride!!
B0013FBS20|5.0|A great buy especially for Blu-Ray HD. The quality of this film is definitely worth the purchase. I have watched it 4 times since I bought it.
B000002HHB|5.0|This is my mellow and happy album. Perfect for sitting on the side of the beach in the Caribbean or just resting at home. The voice is sultry and relaxing and years later I still listen to the album regularly.
B00132D808|5.0|I loved Panic at the disco's debut album, the million selling \\"A fever you can't sweat out\\" and was really thrilled when I finally got its follow up. \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" is quite different from its more energetic electronic/Punk predecessor, featuring sunny harmonies, loads of horns and a retro sound reminiscent in parts of The Beach Boys or the Beatles. The band stated that they wanted a classic rock sound and that's what it sure sounds like.<br /><br />The mood for the most part is mellow. Lead-off single \\"Nine in the afternoon\\" is a bouncy horn sprinkled song with sunny harmonies and quirky time changes. \\"Do you know what I'm seeing\\" is an upbeat string-swathed song with accordion flourishes. \\"I have friends in holy spaces\\" is a Lo-Fi jazzy acoustic piece with lots of horns. \\"When the day met the night\\" has a sunny surf sound, peppered with horns and tinkling pianos.<br /><br />\\"Pas de cheval\\" has a galloping feel with nice harmonies and fleeting horns. Melancholic and Beatles-esque is the ballad \\"Behind the sea\\" with a slight marching drum beat, and an upbeat sing-along coda. \\"Folkin' around\\" is a fiddle filled country song, while \\"She had the world\\" is a melodic acoustic/violin festooned ballad with sixties sounding vocals/harmonies. I love it! Similar but with a slightly faster tempo is \\"From a mountain in the middle of the cabins\\".<br /><br />\\"Mad as rabbits\\" is a sunny upbeat pop rocker, but my favourite song is \\"That green gentleman (Things have changed)\\". This is a bouncy song with a catchy chorus, retro sounding guitars, ELO-style harmonies and lyrics that reference the album title.<br /><br />Most of the song titles are apparently lines appearing in the songs themselves.  The album has a slight oddball pop feel similar to the sound of say The Smiths, and it did take a bit to grow on me but you know what, it's Pretty.Good.
B000VR824S|5.0|[[ASIN:B000VR824S Crossroads: Eric Clapton Guitar Festival 2007]] -   What an amazing concert.  I would recommend everyone who loves music to buy this DVD because it's a real treasure, and as such it's also a great collectors item, or indeed a great gift to give to anyone who appreciates good music.    The young girl who played awesome bass guitar when accompanying the great guitar legend-Jeff Beck was absolutely brilliant.  For someone so young and talented to be able to stand on a stage and play with Jeff Beck as well as keep up with him and lead him, just shows how great she really is as a bass guitarist.  Sadly   however, I saw no mention of her name on the DVD box to refer to, as I would certainly like to learn more about her, as she has an exciting future ahead of her for sure.      This is certainly one of the best concerts I have enjoyed in my lifetime and believe me I have seen many.  Eric Clapton and Stevie Winwood were fantastic together too.  This concert definitely gets a 5 star rating from me.
B0015KO52S|5.0|\\"Consolers of the lonely\\" is the sophomore album by White Stripes' Jack White's side group Raconteurs, and while I prefer \\"Broken boy soldiers\\" (with its crawling title track and the awesome \\"Steady as she goes\\") this is just as good as a whole. As is the case with The White Stripes, The Raconteurs are experimental and the album is musically diverse, you can tell they had a great time recording it.<br /><br />The sound this time around is crunchier and more fractured, though the mood is mellow, with just a few rockers like lead-off single \\"Salute your solution\\" and the title track \\"Consoler of the lonely\\", the latter with jagged guitars, tempo shifts from upbeat verses to a sombre chorus and a squealing guitar outro.<br /><br />\\"You don't understand me\\" is a lovely piano-sprinkled ballad with lovely harmonies. \\"The switch and the spur\\" has dramatic darting horns and a faint Ska feel. It wouldn't go amiss on the soundtrack to some Western movie.<br /><br />\\"Many shades of black\\" is a retro sounding horn sprinkled pop ballad. The rocker \\"Five on the five\\" has a squealing horn/guitar intro, a chugging riff in the verses, squealing vocals, and a punk feel. \\"Top yourself\\" is a nice ballad with bursts of guitar for a chorus.<br /><br />\\"Carolina drama\\" is a Western-style ballad with storytelling lyrics about some bloke named Billy, and lovely ethereal vocal breaks. Simply outstanding! \\"Pull this blanket off\\" is a slow piano/guitar ballad with an almost hymnal feel, while the similar Blues-tinged \\"Rich kid blues\\" eventually picks up speed.<br /><br />I've loved everything Jack White has done since I fell in love with \\"White blood cells\\", and he's been pretty busy the last four years, releasing a White Stripes or Raconteurs album every other year. If you love your rock edgy and experimental, this should be right up your alley.
B000002L7Y|4.0|Hunting High And Low is a clever blast from the past that (for the most part) has while the feature song \\"Take On Me\\" has stood the test of time the rest of the album languishes in forgetable rifts.    Coming out during the infantile stages of MTV and music videos, \\"Take On Me\\" became as much of a signature for the era as \\"Come On Eileen\\" (Dexy's Midnight Runners) or The Buggles' \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\".  While A-ha were promoted (in America) as the best new thing to come out of Europe they had a pretty well established following that lent to a comfortable songwriting prowess and catchy musical hooks.    Obviously, \\"Take On Me\\" was the premiere cut but the rest of the album had comprable good songs that did not match the unique greatness of \\"Take\\".  Yes, \\"The Sun Always Shines On T.V. was a follow-up video but the black and white imagery was oftentimes tedious and did not enhance ones desire to run out and procure a copy of the LP.  Other cuts such as \\"And You Tell Me\\" and \\"Love Is The Reason\\" were okay and a nice complement to the overall compostie of songs but by starting the album with their premiere song that was akin to eating desert and working your way back to the salad.  Tasty but backward.    Although A-ha went on to make numerous other albums, their fate was similar to Big Country (\\"In A Big Country\\") and the aformentioned Dexy's Midnight Runners wher a one-hit wonder does not pay the bills.  For people who just want to embrace the hit, refrain from buying Hunting High And Low and instead look for a greatest hits compilation of the Eighties.
0790733226|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out, and at the time, although I didn't really understand the premise, something about it stuck with me as I grew.  Now, after purchasing this movie and having had the opportunity to sit and watch it again, I see that it truly is a work of art.    Jodie Foster does an amzing job in her role as the first person from our world to EVER make \\"Contact.\\"  While many others shoot her thoughts, ideas, and hopes down throughout the movie, she never wavers once!  Standing firmly in her convictions as a scientist, she aims to make believers of us all.    Although I am not a big Matthew McConaughey fan, he does a solid job as Foster's polar opposite.  Another thing i liked is, although they are very opposite in opinions of the world, they can co-exhist and share one common thing: love.  Now, you may be thinking \\"oh there's a love story here?\\"  Yes, but it never distracts from the overall story; and at a crucial part, even helps to enhance it further.    Very, very solid acting and storytelling in this one.  The directing is also some of the best I've seen.  Add this to the astounding special-effects used, and you have yourself a pretty good movie!    Highly recommended!

B000067J1H|4.0|When this movie first hit the world, i didn't understand the hype; I didn't understand the fascination, and quite frankly I avoided seeing it because of the hype surrounding it.  in a way, i regret not seeing it sooner.    Now however, I own it!  After watching this film many times over since my purchase, I can see why it caught on like it did.  For me, the combination of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt together in a film is amazing.  Both very solid actors that have proven they can hold their own, and carry others if needed.  Both played their own strong characters in this movie, as well as playing off one another with great timing and poise.    The movie itself, is also amazing.  The \\"Fight Club\\" itself, is not what it seems, and at times you may realize this, but you'll never truly know until the end!  The directing is also as good as it gets.  One can tell a lot of caution was placed in constructing the story and how to go about telling it.    I like this movie a lot, and as I mentioned, I do regret not seeing it sooner.  I also take back everything I said about the hype surrounding it, because it really is one of the best movies of the time!
B000005E3K|4.0|I will only listen to Baroque music performed on authentic instruments.  In my opinion, the music demands the proper instruments in order to be truly heard.  Mozart, however, along with other composers of the Classical era, is perfectly acceptable on modern instruments to my ear, as long as they play like the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.  Les Arts Florissants is not a modern orchestra, though.  They are clearly playing on what are supposed to be properly constructed instruments for Mozart's day.  I don't mind the difference at all.<br /><br />Considering that I suffered many years with a recording that became increasingly intolerable due to its lack of originality and fire, the crisp, thin texture of ancient strings, as well as the combination of women's and boys' voices in the choir, is refreshing and new (to me, anyway).<br /><br />One of the nicest things about authentic early music ensembles is that the brass are not constructed to play as loudly as modern brass, so that the orchestra as a whole does not need to hold back.  The choir can belt it out (and they do) while the orchestra goes for greater vigor in the louder, faster passages like the Dies Irae and Confutatis.  In the latter, I prefer to hear only men's and boys' voices, and on this recording, there are women as well, but it is a criticism hardly worth mentioning.  Just listen to these expert singers handle the melismas in the faster tempos.<br /><br />And Christie really pushes the tempos here.  This doesn't sound like those austere, all-too-proper readings of Mozart's music.  Incisive brass, archi con fuoco, even a timpani that shocks you with its ferocity.  I would love to hear him turned loose on some of Mozart's symphonies.  Perhaps sometime in the future, no?

As he did in his previous (though better) films, \\"Bottle Rocket\\" and \\"Rushmore,\\" Anderson creates a slightly off-kilter world populated by benignly eccentric characters - only, in the case of \\"Darjeeling,\\" the comedy is muted and the vision bland (making it more on a par with \\"The Life Aquatic\\" and \\"The Royal Tenenbaums,\\" two of Anderson's lesser films).<br /><br />The price of Anderson's subtlety is that not a whole lot really seems to happen in the movie and the characters never get much of a chance to differentiate themselves from one another.  Each of the brothers is assigned a peculiarly defining quirk or eccentricity, but neither the actors nor the filmmakers (the movie was co-written by Schwartzman and Roman Coppola) seem to know quite what to do with them.  The result is that the comic bits fall flat, while the \\"meaningful\\" moments seem tacked on almost as an afterthought.<br /><br />Wilson (sporting a full head bandage throughout), Brody and Schwartzman do what they can with their roles but the monotonously deadpan tone of the comedy keeps them from breaking out on their own and engaging the viewer.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|The product arrived quickly and in great condition.  The DVDs do not skip at all!  I am really satisfied with my order and how quickly it came.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Actually watched the Director's Cut (i.e. Black & White) version first, and was blown away! Actually worked a little better as a throw-back to the sci-fi epics of the fifties. There are a handful of crisp translations to cinema of the written word ('Old Man And The Sea,' 'To Kill A Mockingbird,' 'The Godfather,' 'Carrie,' 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,' 'Silence Of The Lambs,' and 'No Country For Old Men' come to mind) and this will no doubt ascend to that list.<br /><br />Tight and unforgiving, as a thriller it careens to it's denouncement with a skill rarely witnessed. It is not often that acting skills like this are let lose on material as pulpy as this. The Lovecraftian elements are among the best filmed and are as they should be; vague outlines and reaction shots. When you do get a good look, it has a wormy gloss to it. Makes it grim fun.<br /><br />Problems persist, but, they were persistent in the original material. It is not the dark ending which, though amped from the original, is inevitable and respects the piece. King's hateful prejudice against Christians lives in much of his work, though 'The Stand' and 'The Green Mile' washes much of it away. It, however, is over the top and blooms red in 'The Mist.' Can't help but wonder, though, why artists refuse to see the box office rejection of some of their works as tied to their broad painting of a religion that if done to Muslims would cause riots.<br /><br />Not for every one, but horror fans should rejoice that someone takes this bloody stuff bloody seriously without ripping off more Japanese source material.<br /><br />The Bonus materials are great as well! From the start of the decades long effort to bring the work to the screen to the effects, it is well documented on the second disc. The webisodes are cool, too.<br /><br />And keep an eye out for what my kid called a cameo by the 'Cloverfield' fiend (Though King's Legs-Reaching-To-Heaven have been around long before)! Too cool!

B000UL61D4|5.0|Andrzej Zulawski's The Devil (Diabel) is a portrait of insanity.  It is a horror movie that not everyone will appreciate.  The reason for that would mostly be due to it not being sensible.  Many of the people in the film act like they are drugged out, there is a theatrical feeling to the way they talk and unquestionably many of them act insane.  To say the movie is surrealistic would be an understatement.  The Devil is like stepping into a world of insanity.<br /><br />The story starts out with a crafty beaded man dressed in black entering an asylum run by nuns in 1793, when the Prussians took over part of Poland.  He frees a political prisoner, Jakub, moments before the Prussian army goes in and murders everyone there.  His liberator becomes a sort of strange guide and tries to influence his morals.<br /><br />Jakub's guide is very animated and shows him various places as they travel together in the countryside.  His impish guide seems all knowing.  The people Jakub meets are deeply affected by the war and appear insane.  The moral decay Jakub observes influences him.  At the urging of his guide, he is transformed into a murderer.<br /><br />Although The Devil may appear senseless at first, there is meaning in it.  At first, my impression was that we are seeing insanity caused by war.  But I also thought it suggests the real cause of war and insanity is sin.  Of course, just as with great literature, there are many possible messages one could reveal from this film.  Furthermore, there are also political comments weaved throughout the entire movie dealing with patriotism and invaders.<br /><br />The Devil is unquestionably different.  The fact that it is a horror, which is relatively rare in Polish cinema, makes it stand out compared to other Polish films.  Perhaps the closest film to The Devil (1972) is Instability (Nienasycenie; 2003), which is also Polish.  Both films have that surrealistic feeling and nearly everyone in them is crazy; both have atypical sex and nudity interspersed thought the story; both are for viewers that want something very different.  I have to add that even if you didn't care for Instability that you still may enjoy the Devil because it very unique.the story; both are for viewers that want something very different.

0143038583|5.0|The author makes every effort to trace meals in four categories from the table to the soil.  The meals are categorized as industrial, industrial organic, beyond organic, and self-produced, each with its own section.  They are four very different meals with four very different back-stories, and in each section there are very different characters that help Pollan, and us, understand the characteristics of the food on which he focuses.  By sharing what he learned through his determined efforts to examine the minute history of his food, Pollan forces the reader to reexamine their own choices and question the healthfulness, sustainability, and even morality of their diet.  These histories are brought forth so richly and in such vivid, sometimes horrifying detail, that I challenge any consumer of food to read this book and be unmoved.  This book speaks so fundamentally to the issue of what to eat that it should be the first stop of anyone interested in diet, health, and the social impact of food.<br /> Although the tone of the book is generally objective when presenting the facts and history of each meal, about which he is meticulous, Pollan is open and honest about his personal feelings and difficulties along the way.  He makes every attempt to address all sides of the issues he encounters and to understand each one fully, but this is not a scientific treatise; it is a well-researched voyage of personal discovery, and it is plain to the reader how the author views the morality of his discoveries.  His portrayal of all the people and choices he encounters is sympathetic, but Pollan's opinions are perfectly clear.<br /> What makes this book so compelling is that it throws into sharp relief the histories of meals eaten by the reader, histories previously unknown and unthought of.  The order of presentation draws the reader in by first addressing the meal with which they are likely to be most familiar.  By addressing the industrial meal and its many flaws, Pollan encourages his reader to see this meal for what it really is.  If the natural conclusion that most readers would come to after this realization is to turn to the ever-growing and easily accessible organic market, Pollan's logical follow-up is a dissection of that same organic industry, exposing its failures as well as its achievements.  He then continues on to a meal (\\"beyond organic\\") that seems to be a better alternative and explains exactly why.  Then lastly, he follows this train of thought even farther by addressing the morality and feasibility of a meal made by humanity's original method.<br /> I found this book absolutely fascinating and highly disturbing.  Although the first half of the book was extremely upsetting to me in many ways, there was a great deal of hopefulness as well, and I felt that by making educated food choices, I could do well by myself and the world at large.der to see this meal for what it really is.

1582701709|5.0|Inspirational book, but ... it's not as easy as the book implies. If you buy this book you still need to purchase at least another on Law of Attraction or Cosmic Ordering. However, 5 stars still because Rhonda Byrne has made millions of people realise they can change their lives and has inspired them to look into the law of attraction, positive thinking, witchcraft and other alternative manifestation techniques.<br /><br />I own the book & DVD - I am quite happy with them both!<br /><br />Like attracts like = an occult law, no wonder the negative types (reviewers) haven't obtained any results.

B0008ENICU|5.0|Besides perhaps \\"Mildred Pierce,\\" \\"The Women\\" is absolutely Joan's most famous and much-loved classic film. I really love this movie because it's so well put together, all of the performances are tops and the story is second to none. As you may know already, in this film, Joan plays man-eater, Crystal Allen. Crystal will stop at nothing to sink her claws into Mr. Stephen Haines. And of course it doesn't matter to her that he's a presumably happily married man to everyone's favorite sweetheart, Mary, otherwise known as Mrs. Stephen Haines.     My favorite clips from this movie are probably your favorites as well. I love the scene with Joan in the bathtub on the phone (they didn't have cordless phones back then so it behooves the imagination, where exactly did she stick the cord?) I love the fashion show and the part with Crystal being confronted by holier-than-thou Mary.     When Joan had a hit, she often loved to make 2 or 3 more movies with very similar plots because she didn't want to disappoint her public. A couple of years after filming \\"The Women,\\" Joan made a similar movie, \\"When Ladies Meet.\\" The plot is very similar, but the script and and overall performances were nowhere near as sensational as in this.     Even during Hollywood's Golden Age this film still stands out. The movie almost has an operatic feel to it because it's almost like a musical. All of the lines are almost magical or even poetic.       After 75 years, Joan can still heat up the screen with any number of her classic motion pictures! Like Exile said: she's a miracle, a site to see!
B000JCSBU0|3.0|Requiem:  Generally speaking, a musical composition honoring the dead; more specially (1) the Roman Catholic Mass for the dead, or (2) other commemorative pieces of analogous intent.<br /><br />I keep reading reviews where people say that teenagers should HAVE to see this film because it portrays the true hell that drugs will lead you in to.  However, I disagree.  While hellish looking for most, it also at times seems pretty much like a fantasy.  Even when Marion is brought to her knees (literally) to do the most disgusting things possible in order to get her drugs, she still has a smile on her face. Teenagers with their illusions of immortality may see themselves as \\"smarter\\" than the characters portrayed in this film and able to avoid the pitfalls better than Harry, Marion and Tyrone did.  I'd use caution before I showed this movie to teenagers as a way of \\"scaring them straight\\".<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn, gives one of the best performances I have probably ever seen, as Sara Goldfarb.  She is a true innocent victim, of her son, and her own hope.  Watching her lose her mind when all she wanted to was lose 50 pounds was really heartbreaking.  It would be easy to dismiss her as just a nutty, needy old lady and with Burstyn's performance, you can't.<br /><br />My problem with the film (and this might be a spoiler) is when Harry and Tyrone end up in prison.  The circumstances leading up to that going to a hospital just don't make any sense.  But that may just be the pedantic lawyer in me, because these two were headed for prison one way or another.

B000YDOOUK|5.0|If you want great rock 'n' roll - loud, hard and fast with great guitar work, sing-a-long choruses and heavy drum beats, Airbourne's \\"Runnin' Wild\\" is sure to satisfy. From the epic opening of \\"Stand Up For Rock 'n' Roll\\", to the catchy choruses of \\"Diamond in the Rough\\" or \\"Cheap Wine and Cheaper Women\\", to the flat-out rock energy of these songs, this is a great album. I'd personally prefer the guitar solos to be a bit longer, since I like playing/ listening to longer, more indulgent solos, but whatever. THIS ALBUM ROCKS! If you want an old-school rock treat, you're gonna dig this. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|This film could have been the greatest Sci-Fi film since 2001. But alas, it spends so much time paying homage to all the films that came before, it falls very short of saying anything new itself.<br /><br />But the visuals and the sound design on this film are absolutely incredible. Probably some of the best I've ever seen. Hell, I bought a Blu Ray player just to get closer to the original theatrical experience.<br /><br />In all honesty, I love this movie a lot, and I realize its flaws and know it will probably not be for everyone, but do give it a shot and decide for yourself.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|I want to make my review of R.E.M.'s new cd \\"Accelerate\\" objective. I read the reviews positive and negative here and I agree with all of it. I will be upfront about my views of R.E.M.'s back catalog.<br /><br />Favorite R.E.M. albums: Murmur, Reckoning, Life's Rich Pageant, Green, Out Of Time, Automatic For The People, Monster.<br /><br />Least Favorite: New Adventures In Hi-Fi, Up, Fables Of The Reconstruction, Reveal, Around The Sun, Document.<br /><br />\\"Accelerate\\" pro's: It's back to rock and roll and up-tempo songs for the most part. It's mercifully short after the bloated \\"Around The Sun\\", \\"Reveal\\", \\"Up\\" and \\"New Adventures In Hi-Fi\\". There are memorable tracks like \\"Supernatural Superserious\\", \\"Houston\\", \\"Horse To Water\\" and \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\". \\"Accelerate\\" might be seen as the best thing R.E.M. has done since \\"Monster\\". Or not.<br /><br />\\"Accelerate\\" con's: The lyrics are not memorable. When you listen to the cd all the way through repeatedly, it becomes noticeably flat and repetitive. There are boring songs here like \\"Until The Day Is Done\\", \\"Mr. Richards\\" and the worst track on the cd \\"Sing For The Submarine\\". And yes, I'm going to say it, the cd packaging sucks. I've never been a big fan of R.E.M.'s album covers, and the artwork on \\"Accelerate\\" is awful.<br /><br />Verdict: I don't see \\"Accelerate\\" as better or worse than the much maligned \\"Around The Sun\\". You have two different sounds and speeds, but it's a matter of substitution. I am not fooled. \\"Around The Sun\\" was more adventurous musically, but it could be argued that it was boring. \\"Accelerate\\" is up-tempo and rocking, but I would hardly say it's musically adventurous. Like so many fans have already said, \\"Accelerate\\" is nothing new.<br /><br />I like R.E.M. (I didn't as a kid), and I will probably always buy their cds and like them for what they are. Do I think they should quit? No. Do I think they will surprise us all and try something artistically daring? I don't think so. So I say, just sit back and be glad that Rock And Roll Hall Of Famers R.E.M. are still around because they're still better than most of the junk we have to listen these days.R.E.M. are still around because they're still better than most of the junk we have to listen these days.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|Dr. Robert Neville seems to have more incarnations than Sherlock Holmes at this point. From humble beginnings, birthing slowly in the unlit corner of the one bedroom apartment and rising from the cheap laminate desk of Richard Matheson -- this character seemed destined for greatness. The [[ASIN:0765318741 original story]] reads painfully, is half cheese, half camp ... but strains the eyes continuously, and has a feel to it that is quite moving and worthy of film, graphic novel or some other type of legacy yet unknown.<br /><br />It would seem unlikely that this movie could be compared in anyway to the original short story / novella that shares the same title. In fact, the title might just be the only similarity. My Chinese wife, when she heard about them remaking this - yet again, said: \\"Robert Neville is very repetitively described as a blonde haired, blue eyed white man in the book. Will Smith? I gotta see that.\\" Needless to say, the horror and action fan that she is, she was heavily disappointed in this as it seemed to be its own entity, instead of sharing even the most remote similarity with the book or even the previous films in any way conceivable.<br /><br />I guess it would be foolish to state that this is the only film to have deviated so far, but we all know that isn't the truth by a long shot. [[ASIN:B000VAHR14 The Omega Man]], [[ASIN:B0001932ZA The Running Man]], [[ASIN:B00070FX5U Total Recall]], [[ASIN:B00005JL78 Minority Report]] and even [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner]] all differ from their original source material - some heavily while others subtly. Who's to say whether this practice is right or wrong? Some of these films are blockbusters while others are heavily dated and total flops. Apparently, Matheson, not only approved of this version, but stated that he thought it was the best so far. Maybe he was referencing the size of the licensing contract and repetitive royalty amounts, surely he couldn't be favouring this over the Charleton Heston version.<br /><br />But what is it about Hollywood that seems to believe that good books just don't translate onto the screen? All the films I previously mentioned are decent books that would've made good direct adaptations, and I can say this confidently because the adjusted adaptations were nothing memorable or impacting, all with the exception of Blade Runner. Giving credit where credit is due, [[ASIN:B00003CXA2 Forrest Gump]] made an interesting adaptation from a sub-par book to an excellent film.  But this type of foolish recklessness is unfortunately more prevalent in the Science-Fiction genre when it comes to adaptations.<br /><br />When I saw this movie at Target, it was on sale for $15.99, but beside it was another version for $24.99 that had the `controversial ending'. So, now, we must either pay an extra ten bucks to see the version where the Vampire Zombies have any level of noticeable intellect and show a glimmer of cunning, or we end up getting both versions for $35, because we just HAVE to see the other version. They used to market these `other versions' for two or three dollars more, which I used to have no problem with, but this is just unforgivable. Double-dipping is understandable in some cases, like with `[[ASIN:B00005V3Z4 Donnie Darko]]'. Numerous years passed until the Director had a chance to make his desired corrections, and when they were made, [[ASIN:B0006GAOBI another DVD]] was released. What `I Am Legend' is trying to do is just foolish. The alternate ending is not worth the ten dollars, so save your money. And, sigh ... don't worry what I just told you is nothing close to a spoiler. So if you haven't seen any of the films or ever read the book, you're none the wiser, but hopefully a little more informed.<br /><br />I also found the use of the soundtrack was superficial and annoying. A lot of opportunities were wasted on this film, the soundtrack is probably one of the biggest ones, as it could've equated into more revenue for the producers and distributors of this let down. `[[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]]', a film that really raised the bar on these type of `chaos reality' films, has a groundbreaking soundtrack with even a few tracks (18 and 20) that are deeply reminiscent of the score that was used in `The Omega Man' and were quite moving. The majority of James Newton Howard's score wasn't even used in the film. The film was overwrought with so much Foley nonsense (action, explosion, sound effects) that the actual composition for this movie had been dialed into the off position or forgotten about entirely. Shame on the mix done in post by the sound board hacks guzzling diet Pepsi. James Newton Howard may have attempted to repeat his success here from the `Batman Begins' soundtrack, but apart from a few memorable moments, the majority of the musical score here is just way too slow, boring and very forgettable.<br /><br />Since I've noted `28 Days Later', let me just say that that `film' probably had a lot of creative impact on this `movie' from its inception or first utterance of \\"let's remake `The Omega Man'\\". `28 Days Later' and `28 Weeks' later recouped more money than either of their primary budgets, thus sending signals to Hollywood, that these types of films would essentially be good vehicles for their leading stars. The problem here is that even though you put bankable stars into a bankable idea it doesn't necessarily equate to a success. Also '28 Days Later' is probably the high water mark of all horror zombie films. Danny Boyle set the bar so high that other imitators will likely fail to even come within groveling distance.<br /><br />This movie's major flaws were the deviation in the writing and not adhering to enough of the other films or the original novella. Reciting lines from `Shrek' when confronted with other survivors was also another poor use of story, viewer time and appreciation of the material or the genre. The use of the mannequins was a nice touch to the creepy, artsy feel that was readily prevalent in `The Omega Man' but it just wasn't enough to admit that it's a worthy adaptation.

B000VI70WM|3.0|Honestly I was surprised when I first heard this album due to the complete break of pace from what one would call the classic Duran Duran album.  This album is, for the most part, beat driven.  But it's not a bad thing. . . it just takes some getting used to.  Duran Duran has always been music that you can dance to, so it only makes sense that as dance music changes, the progression of the band's music would also change with the times.    Despite the heavy beats, the key elements of what makes Duran Duran great are still there:  Simon LeBon's crooning, the light guitars, the synth, etc.  In fact, the tracks \\"Falling Down\\" and \\"Box Full O' Honey\\" could easily belong on their last album - even with the emphasized beats.  And the last track (which was co-written by Justin Timberlake) is simply perfect.    Still though, this album is not perfect as at times it is too much a departure from the traditional Duran Duran sound.  It's too divisive for a lot of old fans and too half and half between old school and new school dance music to draw in a a lot of new, younger fans.  So if you're already into Duran Duran and you can enjoy hip hop beats, this album is great.  But if you are not into both sounds already, it just won't work for you.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I have watched this DVD five times since I bought it.  My first impression was quite negative;however, I love it now! Having said that, I do have to fast forward through the part of Anne running all over Bath - I just cannot stand it!  I also pass up watching the pre-kiss scene.  All in all, and in spite of the changes made to the original book, this is a beautifully made version with most actors doing a great job (watching Mary is a bit painful).    I do recommend this version, but I will have to say that, in my opinion, the 1996 version is better and my favorite.
B0011HOEY4|1.0|Don't bother with this movie.  Watch The Wire and you'll see what great acting, plot and dialogue are all about.  This movie features great actors \\"at their worst\\".  I wouldn't have bothered except that I love NYC and wanted to see a quasi-historical movie about the Vietnam era and the destructive effect of the War on Drugs in Manhattan.    If they allowed ZERO stars, this movie might be worth a ZERO.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a good exercise video with 3 different intensity level workouts and an easier and harder version of the exercises on each level.  The only equipment needed is a pair of hand weights and possibly a mat if you need one.  It is quick and fairly intense, but a beginner can easily participate.
B00000F5KH|5.0|Young Brazilian boy (Josue) yearns to meet his father who left his Mother shortly after he was born.  Josue and his illiterate Mother visit a letter writer (Dora) at a Rio train station to compose a letter to his Father in an attempt to reach out to him.  Shortly after leaving the letter writer, a horrible accident leaves Josue homeless.  Josue, a suspicious, crafty, sharp-tongued young boy finds his way back to Dora - and then through an unusual set of events (which we won't disclose here) - they depart on a journey to find his father.    Dora, played by Fernanda Montnegro, is magnificent in this film.  She is a cynical, sad, middle aged former school teacher who you dislike early on in the film - to someone you begin to acquire compassion for - to a heartfelt ending where you can't help but feel admiration and warmth.    The story opens in Rio de Janeiro where you see spectacular pictures of the crowded trains, train stations, tenement housing - and then moves into the Brazilian countryside where the film-maker captures the desolation, the hardships and the simplicity of life.  The film is wrapped in beautiful fitting piano music.  Beautiful, moving film...

I have shared it with all those closest to me. Read it and decide for yourself....if you don't get something meaningful out of it...then you are empty spiritually. The message is timeless and much needed these days!

My introduction to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was from Bridget Jones' Diary. I had to find out what the parrell was so I rented this movie and then read the book. I bought the movie to start my Austen collection.  I also bought the 2007 version and liked it but liked this because it was closest to the book.

Let's talk about how this album \\"rocks\\", how it's loaded with a sense of urgency that you feel every second.  Let's talk about how at 45 RPMs and just 3 songs on each side (except side 3, which has 2 songs) it only enhances that feeling.  But PLEASE, please, please, don't call it a comeback.  They simply evolved, as they always have, and, hopefully, always will.<br /><br />This is not \\"classic\\" REM, as I'm, as a life long fan since I got Green on vinyl oh so many years ago, not sure what that even means!  Is classic REM their sound from Murmurs?  From Fables?  From Pageant?  Or maybe Out of Time or Automatic?  Oh, you mean from Adventures?<br /><br />Each one of their albums is it's own album, and has it's own sound, but is always \\"REM\\".  This is what has made them simply one of the great American bands ever.  This is no comeback, this is simply what is \\"next\\" for REM them, and this time it meant speeding & turning it up!<br /><br />So, I recommend you pick this album up, get ready to drop the needle, and \\"kick it out on the dance floor like you just don't care\\" for 4 fast-paced incredible sides...
1577314808|3.0|Tolle, like so many other pop-spiritual authors on the Western marketplace bookshelves of \\"Self Help\\", \\"Philosophy & Spirituality\\", etc. titles, has taken the teachings of the Buddha (+/- 2400 years old) and edited them as original ideas of his own.  Albeit, a Truth is a Truth is a Truth no matter who says it, perhaps the Westernized vernacular is necessary for this new age.  Nothing Tolle teaches is original, or uniquely his ideas. They are borrowed from the ancient traditions of BuddhaDharma, and the Upanishads before that.  Of course, Christianity and the Western cultures have their mystical history, but in that context it has always been seen as just that: mystical.  There is nothing mystical nor magical about discovering Being In The Present Moment.  This entire idea was taught by the Buddha in the Bhadekaratta Sutra 400+ years before Rome (the benchmark time/age of the Western world).      To compress, however, the practice and Awareness of Being In The Present Moment into a bookstore best-seller format (not too long; not too short for the average modern reader), sells the practice short and betrays the greater and deeper meaning inherent in the concept. It is crucial to not simply reiterate already ancient and tried-and-true views and perspectives, but to also engage in a thorough explanation of the overall depth of the workings of consciousness, Mindfulness, Concentration and practice...not just expounding \\"pretty\\" language about a practice that can considerably transform living life in this cluttered and often distracting modern world.      These types of books by pop-culture opportunists like Tolle, et al, give people a transient \\"hope\\" and availability on the best seller list for several months, but then drop off the radar of the average Western reader 10 years later. Why?  Because the topic is not thoroughly covered...it is a segment of a greater teaching, polished up nicely as a \\"new idea\\", given a spot on The Oprah Show (an existential-humanist on Monday, a Buddhist on Wednesday and a Neo-Christian by Friday type pop culture show), then sold as a Life Changing path to Enlightenment in glossy cover by a major American/Euro publisher.  I have read the book and found almost verbatim suggestions and topics given to me by my teacher over twenty years ago, given to her before that by her teacher, and given to him before that...dating back thousands of years. BUT with one difference: a deeper and more thorough exploration of the Mind, the condition of being Human, the examination of psychological imprints and their impact on worldview (and selfview), on and on.    This book, like so many others, is the equivalent of a quick-fix pill common to the modern mindset of the average American/European reader. The \\"answer\\" is not in the medication, but in the taking of it AND then changing one's lifestyle to prevent the same dis-ease from occurring again.    I suppose books like this will always sell here because they propose a \\"new\\" concept to the Western world without being too Eastern in use of language, references, and such.  If we were to be truly honest, as spiritual teachers, we would reveal to the world the great offerings already in existence and work with them as a complement to our current culture rather than pretend to invent or develop a philosophy and call it our own. Tolle is simply selling BuddhaDharma as a neo-spirituality without calling it what it is.
B000I8ERVC|5.0|What a great movie! Easy Rider brought back some good memories of days gone by. I first saw this with my dad at a drive in theater.[[ASIN:B000I8ERVC Easy Rider]]
0930289528|5.0|The most interesting thing about \\"V for Vendetta\\" is that the main theme of the novel isn't actually one man standing up to Fascism, though that's an aspect of it.  The more relevant political theme is Anarchism, though it's still only partly about that.  The primary themes are about people; about people taking their freedom and the responsibility that goes along with it.  The creeping Fascism of the book came not from the scheming of an elite, but from the failure of the countrymen to take control of their own lives, and instead taking the simple way out and following the group that promised to take away their fear.     The freedom of \\"The Land of Do As You Please\\" isn't the answer, but rather than the opposite of authoritarian ideas of responsibility they're one and the same, both accepting the easy answer rather than standing up and actively choosing.  Moore and Lloyd's Anarchism is a freedom of self-rule, where you take real responsibility for governing your own actions among your peers and hold your ideals in a way that can't be threatened.  On a personal level, this a case made well; even Finch, who isn't pushed through this like Evey but goes through a (potentially absurd) revelation is better than Mrs. Heyer's ultimate dependency.  The authors skimp, however, on the possible rise of this unruled order - the novel takes place under the old order.  It's rather clear they would pin the blame on the people, and not the system, if it didn't work.    Moore is certainly verbose; there's a lot of talking here and most of the fights are abrupt matters.  Lloyd's art isn't outstanding or beautiful (though the faded color may due to the printing), but it's never a problem and the lighting, shade, and color augments the action.  The minimal use of internal monologue, and complete lack of sound effects or thought bubbles means it has to pull it's own weight and it does.  V for Vendetta is a great graphic novel - as much or more for it's warnings of letting us fall prey toour fears and appetites in a subtle way as for the overt threat of Fascism.
B000077VOY|5.0|Again great special effects by Derek Meddings and music by Barry G.  I can add very little to what others have said except that the character stuff and lives off the ship were well explored, and some great humor.  Compare this to Voyage to The Bottom of the Sea.  A good show but stories never covered the lives of the crew in such depth.  The puppets may be akin to wooden but they sure werent as wooden as those of live actors in so many sci-fi shows.
0465092764|4.0|In the 90's, I started hearing about this wonderful leap in our understanding of physics, called \\"string theory\\".   From the brief clips that I had read, I thought. \\"Wow, I want to know more.\\"   So when, \\"The Elegant Universe\\" came out, I immediately bought it and read it.   The book was very well written, and everything was presented in such an exuberant, upbeat manner.  The illustrations were entertaining, but really all of the things that he covered scientifically, I knew had already been discovered previous to string theory.   There were no new discoveries in the book, but everything in the book was being mixed with string theory, and then it was given a wonderful send off, with how string theory could solve everything.  I'm sorry, but I couldn't at that point help but feel, that I had just been given a heaping helping dose of complete BS.  He did add a lot of sugar to it though.  No new discoveries.  No real predictions.  But lots of hopeful innuendoes, and future promises, if only the universe was in 10 dimensions.  If, if, if, and then, wouldn't it all be grand.   I thought that I was all alone in feeling that the wool was being pulled down over my eyes.  I thought that maybe there was something wrong with me.  I read the book a second time, a few years later, and I bought Greene's second book, \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\", and yet still, my BS meter kept going off.   It was kind of like those commercials that say things like. \\"This product works five times better than the leading brand.\\"  ...leading brand of what?      Finally some other books started coming out that explained that I was not the only one who felt this way.  I read Lawrence Krauss' book, \\"Hiding in the Mirror\\".  It was nice and polite in saying that \\"string theory\\" may not be the answer after all.   Lee Smolin came out with, \\"The Trouble with Physics\\".  That book was even better at showing \\"string theory\\" for the mistake that it is, and how the physics academia have shamelessly promoted it.  It made me feel sorry for those that were trying to pursue a higher education in physics.     Finally this book, \\"Not Even Wrong\\" written by Peter Woit.  I've gotta admit that most of what he says in the first half of his book is over my head.  I have never studied the math that is involved with particle physics or \\"string theory\\", but Woit has.  He can point out all of the flaws in detail with \\"String Theory\\".  From about chapter 12 on, I understood the ideas represented and discussed.     String theorists use phrases like, \\"It's the only game in town.\\", and \\"It's so elegant and beautiful, that there must be some truth to it.\\"  This book shows that some games just aren't worth playing, especially if you can never win.   He also points out that the math involved is not really elegant or beautiful at all.   Can \\"String Theory\\" be proven wrong?  No.  But that's because it makes no predictions about anything.  It's like an incomplete sentence.   \\"The sky is ....\\".   String theorists have been saying for over 20 years that they are just that close to solving everything.  Woit can tell you that that's complete and total BS.   No amount of math can complete the sentence and solve everything.   \\"Not Even Wrong\\" is also good at showing the scary situation that the physics community is in right now.  Their self glorifying promotion, the greed, and pride have all attributed to this terrible situation in which they have created a belief system that is completely false. It is no longer science anymore, but they have gone so far down that road into falsehood that they are too embarrassed to say that they were mistaken.  They have become a false religion of physics.   Scientists are not better people like they want you to believe.  They are just people.  They are prone to the same mistakes that everyone else is.  Just as there are some good people, there are also some good scientists, but the opposite is also true.  Don't be mislead.   If you are a student of physics in college, \\"Not Even Wrong\\" really should be read by you.  \\"The Trouble with Physics\\" was an easier read, and so if you are a layman with a basic knowledge of physics, this book would be for you.  If you are just beginning your adventure in science and physics, but are wondering about \\"string theory\\", \\"Hiding in the Mirror\\" would be the easiest book to understand.

B000063UR1|4.0|I remember seeing \\"Silent Running\\" when it first came out, when I was 10 or 11.  Seeing it again, I realize almost every scene was etched in my memory.  No other movie has combined such outstanding special effects with the melancholy of a solitary character.      Obviously, this was a product of the eco-movement of the 60's and 70's, so it's about how by the year 2001 all the vegetation on Earth is gone, and what's left is exiled to space.  I was set to experience it as the extreme product of environmentalist wackos.      But the beauty and the eeriness of it holds up well.  Just pretend it's about the following century, with the situation starting in 2101.  That's easy to do, with the casual use of artificial gravity, the sophistication of the drones, and the implied terraforming that has made Earth all temperate with no use for forests.      As an aside:  No one comes away with Bruce Dern's Freeman as the favorite character.  (He's made his mark playing anti-social types.)  Everyone's favorite characters are the drones!  They are endlessly fascinating.  Try not to scream over the fate of poor lil' Drone #3.  And get into endless debates about whether Drone #2 was in good enough shape to leave with Drone #1.

There was only one only glitch in the product; the bindings of one book was not well attached to the pages,  and within a few minutes of opening the book, the pages started to separate.      However,  when I contacted Amazon, they immediately shipped a new copy.  The bindings were fine on the new books, so everything turned out fine. I really have to compliment Amazon for moving fast on this.     In summary: Great product and Great Service

B000YABYLA|4.0|Let me say that just because a movie's dialogue sometimes captures the way people really talk does not mean it is Oscar worthy. There are plenty of other films that do the same thing and are never even considered for Oscars. Additionally, this movie's script ranges from the utterly typical to the overly thought-out in which case is equally un-Oscar worthy. What should be rewarded, instead, is consistency, and this movie lacks that in spades.<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) is a somewhat masculine and alternately strange 16 year old girl with the inability to understand herself and the people around her. She discovers she is pregnant with the child of an awkward friend (Michael Cera) and immediately decides to have an abortion. Without much consultation from the father of the baby, she heads down to the clinic to discover a schoolmate protesting the murder of babies that already have fingernails. Juno changes her mind, and with the help of her best friend (Olivia Thirlby) searches for needy couples in the Penny Saver. She finds her perfect match, a wealthy duo (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) who have been trying for years to conceive without any luck. Upon meeting them, she signs her baby away and that is that. However, a strange connection is formed between Juno and her future baby's daddy which throws a wrench into the situation.<br /><br />An entertaining though somewhat boring romp about teen pregnancy, Juno makes us laugh with its quips and wacky situations but it is hardly cutting edge. With funnier and more memorable movies like Saved! and Knocked Up coming before it, Juno is by now a typical story that cannot be redeemed with its slightly less typical characters. Enjoyable, yes, but outstanding, no.<br /><br />This DVD features some unfunny deleted scenes and gag reels. The one and only gem is a scene with the old woman who threw out a living room set who says, \\"Jesus loves all colors, except Mexican.\\"

B000ZOXDFA|4.0|The follow-up film to 1998's \\"Elizabeth,\\" \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\" continues the story of Elizabeth I, played by Cate Blanchett, who reprises her role from the previous film. The film deals with the Virgin Queen's relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh, while King Philip II of Spain amasses a massive armada to destroy Elizabeth, and replace her on the throne with Mary, Queen of Scots.<br />While the film does take dramatic license with historical events, it is a moving, powerful portrayal of the life and times of Elizabeth I. Blanchett is once again fantastic as Elizabeth, while Clive Owen is great as Raleigh. Samantha Morton (Mary), Geoffrey Rush (Walsingham) and Jordi Moll&agrave; (Philip II) give strong supporting performances. While the story itself is a bit slow during the first half, it picks up in the second half, with fantastic visual effects and action creating a powerful reenactment of the fight with the Spanish Armada off the British Coast.<br />If you enjoyed the original \\"Elizabeth,\\" then you will find equal enjoyment out of \\"The Golden Age.\\" But if you haven't seen the first film, you'll be sure to enjoy this film all the same.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I've seen \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" any number of times over the last thirty years.  I was always blinded by the film's top-notch artistry but I think I was missing the forest for the trees.  What dawned on me was that writer John Steinbeck and director John Ford were mad.  Not just regular mad but mean and mad.  The outrage stems from how a democracy such as ours could mistreat it's citizens at a time when they needed help the most.  Adding insult to injury the disenfranchised were subjected to any number of psychological and physical injuries to their person.  No wonder the New Deal was such a godsend.  And I'm a Republican!  Despite the presence of a top-of-the line star in Henry Fonda, Ford and lensman Gregg Toland give the film a cinema-verite style that makes you believe you are watching a documentary instead of a filmed novel.  The forlorn faces on display don't appear to come from Central Casting.  You can actually taste the dust that's the remnants of the sharecroppers prior trade.  Fonda, in probably the best performance of his career, gives an understated account of Tom Joad, parolee turned activist that's both convincing and sincere.  Jane Darwell, as Ma Joad, gives one of the all-time great performances by an actress, supporting or otherwise.  The worldweariness on Ma's face tells it all.  A defining scene in the film is one where Ma tries to feed the family while a group of malnutrioned children look on.  You can sense the agony as Ma, with meager food supplies, tries to figure out how to provide for her kin without turning the children away.  \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is not just essential viewing it's mandatory.
B00005JNQA|4.0|A nationally known reviewer (or, at least, he is well known in LA area radio) was mentioning in a review over the radio that the movie showed too many close-ups of Nicole Kidman's face, but I was able to talk with him over the telephone, and I told him that I didn't even notice that the camera lingered on close-ups of Nicole's face.  Besides, she's a pretty girl, and a movie could do worse than show lots of close-ups of Nicole Kidman's face, and I told him  (and you too, amazon readers) if a person REALLY wants to see a movie that sets the record for having so much of itself consisting of close-ups of one person's face, try The Ring Two, where practically the whole movie is close-ups of Naomie Watts's face.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Disney/Pixar is a match made in heaven. Ratatouille is a fun journey into the world of the \\"foodie\\".  With the Food Network getting so much attention these days and some noted chefs having ratings that rank up there with sports heros, it was fun to see a little ridicule directed their way - i.e. the book written by the spirit guide Chef Gusteau was named \\"Anyone Can Cook\\".  Well, in this case the \\"anyone\\" is a rat named Remy. Remy (who channels the dead chef) in turn acts as the puppet master for the young cook Linguini.  I don't know how in heck Pixar got away with this cultist story line, while Potter got blasted from every fundamentalist pulpit in the nation.  Maybe it's because it takes place in France and we all know how odd the French are.<br /><br />The anamation is top rate, the story is fun, the rats in the kitchen may make you squirm, but not any more than Wiley Coyote falling 2,000 feet to his death in a cactus patch.  This one's a keeper.....bg
B0010YSD7M|3.0|I love ben browder in farscape far better than I like him in Stargate. I guess I just a Jack O'Neill fan to appreciate his character and the changes in the team.  Overall the movie was good and is worth having if you are a SG-1 fan.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Father, Son and Holy Spirit = The unholy trinity of Sondheim & Depp & Burton.  I think you almost have to be into all three of them to have this movie work for you.  It's a musical, no less, about a wronged barber out to seek revenge on the corrupt judge Turpin who falsely sentenced him to fifteen years in prison in order to make moves on his wife.  The wife drank poison and the judge took the lovely daughter as his ward but as the movie opens and the barber returns to find his family, the judge decides to make moves on the daughter.<br /><br />Mrs Lovett (Burton's current domestic squeeze) rents a room to Sweeney over her meat pie shop.  They sing and dance and after Todd begins his new career as slasher, they grind up the cadavers to make meat pies that become the rage of London.<br /><br />Lovett falls in love with Todd but he is completely off his nut and continues his rampage of slashing and ultimately hacks the neck of his beloved (up till now presumed dead) wife who has become a dull witted street wench.  Now he goes completly berserk and tosses Lovett into the pie furnace where she hits the ultimate high note.<br /><br />This is actually quite an entertaining film and Depp handled the singing and dancing with aplomb.  Burton's makeup of Todd and Lovett reminded me of The Corpse Bride but on real folks - I guess this is sort of his trademark.  It's not for the squeemish or the kiddies though....bg
032147404X|5.0|This book is an interesting read and handy reference.  I find especially useful the last section that is a \\"If you want to take a picture like this, do this\\" section.  In one to 1 1/2 pages each, the author give simple hints on how to set up specific kinds of shots.  I intend to work through these sections and learn what I can hands on.    This is not a theory book but a book of practical hints and advice for a variety of situations.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Will Smith seems to gravitate towards Sci-Fi and carries this burden well.  He plays it straight and lends a certain credibility to this often scoffed at venue.  This is the 3rd film to adapt Richard Matheson's 1950-something novel.  Smith follows the sinister Vincent Price and the iconic Charleston Heston as the solitary leading man.  I've seen them all and Will is the hands down winner.<br /><br />The current incarnation of Matheson's novel has Smith as a virologist who has helped develope a strain that is touted to be a cure for cancer.  Apparertly, it does cure the cancer but in the \\"piper must be paid\\" price tag, it also mutates into a \\"rabies like\\" form.  The age old question: \\"pick your poison\\" is taken to new heights.<br /><br />Smith spends his days prowling New York City for food and supplies with his dog.  Nature is creeping back into the city in the form of foliage and foraging wild amimals.  He lives in a heavily fortified vault to avoid the night-time marauding of the rabid vampire types of humans left alive.<br /><br />Smith is a powerful presence on the screen and can carry off this one man show without working up much of a sweat.  I've always respected him as an actor but after seeing this film I hold him in even higher esteem.  bg
B00154GEFU|1.0|I really really like the 1st one.  Didn't like Alpha at all.  Don't like this one either for exactly the same reasons: too pop.  Too light, too easy listening.  The first one was hard hitting, wrapping pop trappings around driving progressive melodies.  Alpha and this one completely forget the progressive part and are just way too mainstream.

B00003A9QI|5.0|I love movie music and am always looking for something astronomically beautiful. I'm a huge fan of Horner (not doing much lately), James N. Howard, John Williams (not as original anymore) and especially Thomas Newman.    I just happened to be watching Cider House Rules looking for new material. The movie was staggeringly slow, plodding and boring, but I waded through the thing just for the score!    I had  not paid any attention to the only female composer out there because she writes for movies I'd never see. Can't stand skinny Gwinny Paltrow and would NEVER see a movie like Emma, but I bought the score movie unseen.    Now I am beginning a Portman music collection. Sure wish I'd known about the Legend of Bagger Vance before the music became collectible and the cheapest CD out there is nearly $90.00.    Portman's bio shows so many works. She is quite prolific and injects as much emotion into her scores as Newman does. I'll be watching for her from now on.    Buy this score! It is 100% magnificent!
B0013FXWVU|5.0|Judging by the previews, I would not have gone and seen this film. However, being forced to for my younger sister's birthday party, I reluctantly went to the film, evn sitting through Harkins' incredibly lame Go Green campaign.<br /><br />As it turns out, I'm glad I went. The film was a lot of fun, entertaining the whole way. Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell were excellent choices for the main cast.<br /><br />What really impressed me though, is that the film stayed within it's G rating. Unlike many children's films of the time, 'Horton' does not contain anything that I would categorize as innapropriate, with one POSSIBLE exception. (*see below)<br /><br />Overall, I found it very enjoyable and funny. Some of the better parts included the Japanese style anime sequence, a *certain hilarious line (\\"In my world there are only ponies, who eat rainbows and poop butterflies\\") and my personal favorite, the musically stirring finale.<br /><br />A must see family film. Four and a half well earned stars.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|Despite scathing criticism of his \\"Polar Express\\", Robert Zemeckis seems determined to establish himself as the founding father of a new way of filmmaking: fully computer generated movies that are based on real actors and real acting, who are transformed into digital characters that are supposed to be indistinguishable from live ones. Obviously, the technique offers interesting possibilities: average built Anthony Hopkins can be turned into a tubby little king, and tubby Ray Winstone into a Men's Health cover model (including a remarkable propensity to take off his clothes). Angelina Jolie's lips and bosom can be bloated into shapes way beyond the reach of silicone without so much as touching a syringe. The CG-characters blend more naturally into their CG-surroundings than has ever been seen in films that put real actors in CG worlds.<br /><br />However, we are still a very long way off from creating CG-actors that look like the real thing. Joints, mouths and eyes are dead give-aways. The slug-like lips and strangely non-symmetrical mouths were particularly distracting. Skin is too smooth, lacking the underlying definition of the myriad muscles and tendons in a real human. Emotional expressions, which depend on so many almost imperceptible details, remain firmly stuck in crude cartoon mode. So basically, what we get is a rather morbid looking cast, like a group of rubber zombies, and a distinct sense of estrangement settles on the viewer when watching their antics. Half the time I was waiting for Shrek to walk in.<br /><br />However, the star of the show is not Shrek, but Grendel, who is something like Gollum's big, violent, mentally retarded brother. He's horrible and touching at the same time, which is a real accomplishment, and he is no doubt the one original creation worth watching Beowulf for. Be warned that he thinks of biting off and chewing somebody's head as a light afternoon snack. Several scenes are pretty gory, but the overall artificiality of the movie effectively precludes any sense of shock.<br /><br />The story is simple enough: heroic Beowulf liberates the Danes from the curse of Grendel, only to fall himself into the same trap that caused the problem in the first place, the trap being Grendel's buxom ma combined with the hero's lack of control over his hormonal impulses. Demons, sea monsters and a dragon provide occasion for satisfying fantasy spectacle. The action moves along at a nice pace, though its motivation is not always clear. The result is sometimes hilarious: Beowulf's nude fight with Grendel must rank as one of the great moments of comedy in recent animation - not altogether inadvertently it seems, for the way his genitals are cleverly kept out of sight is a thinly disguised retake on Bart's naked skateboard ride in \\"Simpsons, the Movie\\".<br />The design of the movie is of the kind the regular moviegoer is by now quite overfed (if not simply fed up) with. It is generally well done, but don't expect anything you haven't seen before. And unfortunately, CG surf, fire and smoke look as unconvincing as the humans do. Still a long way to go...cludes any sense of shock.

B00005JPSM|3.0|No Reservation starts out good enough, depicting a head chef who cares about nothing more than the fact that the food gets out of the kitchen, and that the diners enjoy the food, almost to a fault.<br /><br />However, as No Reservation unfolds, it reveals a predictable plot that may find you asking; \\"have I seen this before?\\"<br /><br />The leads, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin, all turn in very good performances, especially Breslin, who acts with ability beyond her years. However, even good players can't save a bad play, and such is the case with this film. There are points in the film where you will actually say the next line before it was uttered...that's how predictable it is.<br /><br />It was enjoyable, to a certain extent, but unless you are an avid food (or Eckhart) lover, it won't leave much of an impression.

0452289963|5.0|I haven't read previous books by Eckhart Tolle but A New Earth was recommended to me<br />by a holistic medical practitioner. My primary spiritual teacher is Rudolf Steiner.<br />Difficult reading but great grasp of the spiritual realm and how it interpenetrates the physical.<br />Steiner's lectures are all translated from the German and even in German he is<br />difficult to understand but well worth the effort.<br />Reading Tolle's newest book is a different experience for me. He doesn't use Steiner's terminology like \\"etheric\\" and \\"astral worlds\\" but refers to them using much less esoteric words.<br />Reading the book and watching him on Oprah's show on the Internet is just a great<br />Aha! experience. Tolle is so articulate and he quotes Christ a great deal and explains His teaching in simple, comprehensible language.<br />I'm so grateful for Eckhart Tolle and his universal wisdom used with Zenlike simplicity.<br /><br />I can't recommend the book enough. I'm coming to the end and I wish it would go on and on.<br />I know there are dogmatic people who condemn any teaching that doesn't come<br />directly from  the Bible. To them I would say, there is more than one way to explain<br />the truth and wonder of the Universe and the joy of just being alive. Be flexible and<br />enjoy this experience, no matter how difficult it may seem.<br />Tolle, in my opinion, updates his teachings in a remarkable yet simple way.<br />He addresses every possible human situation and how to<br />be at peace with it no matter how hard it may seem.<br />Read this book and if you are open and give it a chance it will change your life!!
0307341550|2.0|Gillian Flynn is the chief TV critic at Entertainment Weekly, so it's no surprise that she's come up with a novel that reads like a TV MOV (Movie of the Week) starring lots of fading actors from now defunct weekly programming.  It's not a mystery (you can figure it out it in two minutes). It's not a southern gothic horror thing although Flynn might have been trying to go there. It's not even a good Soapie.  Ms. Flynn might have been trying to draw our attention to the very real concerns of female school bullying, child abuse, or cruelty to animals but under her pen it all just adds up to a bunch of superficial shlock tossed up in the air to provide cheap, weepy thrills and a sense of 'poor-me-as-victim' from a comfy distance for her readers and, hopefully I'm sure, make her enough dough to get her out of that Entertainment Weekly grind.    Not a bad title.

B00005JLWN|3.0|I can easily see why people either love or loathe this one. Personally, it had aspects I enjoyed, as well as aspects that annoyed me, hence my middle of the road rating. In all honesty, the more I thought about it, the less I liked it, but you could also argue that the fact the film made me think about it at all after watching is a good thing...<br /><br />On the plus side, there's some decent cinemetography, and sets were great. I especially liked the forced juxtaposition of drab, monotonous sets with brightly colored ones, which was especially effective in underscoring the film's theme.<br /><br />As for the negative: the plot was painfully predictable -- especially if you even have a passing familiarity with 1984, Brave New World, etc. I called all but one plot point within the first 20 minutes. The script/dialogue was also hum-drum with little \\"good\\" dialogue, though the case could be made for that being intentional given the forced-emotionless milieu.<br /><br />I would also consider the fight sequences to be a negative, though they actually deserve their own paragraph. Although I can see how they would be a big appeal of the film -- admittedly they were well done/choreographed within their context -- but in all honesty, I found them out of place. Having super-human moves like these make sense only within context: similar effects in The Matrix or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon are okay because those are by definition other-worldly (a computer sim and a fantasy setting, respectively.) That is brazenly NOT the case with Equilibrium, and we are supposed to believe that someone can dodge bullets simply because of a little study on the subject. Sorry, but that's just too much suspension of disbelief for me, especially since this film otherwise purports to be grounded in \\"reality.\\"<br /><br />If you like films that are just fight-fests and don't really care about \\"plot\\" except as a contrived means to get you from one battle to the next, then this film will *probably* appeal to you... though it probably has too much \\"plot\\" and not enough \\"action\\" for your tastes. Personally, I like to see people using their wits (rather than their fists) to get out of sticky situations, so if you fall into a similar category, skip it. At the very least, go into it expecting a relatively brainless popcorn flick.bly has too much \\"plot\\" and not enough \\"action\\" for your tastes.

B00005MP58|5.0|I just love this movie the remake with keria knightly was great but this was so much more detailed. I love this movie
0780622553|5.0|EDIT: my original review (below, now slightly modified) was for the \\"original\\" version; there is now a \\"director's cut\\" available, and this fixes most of the problems I had with the original. However, Amazon is conflating all reviews into one lump.<br /><br />This film does a great job of mixing Philip K. Dick-ish \\"what is reality?\\" science fiction with a visual hard-boiled detective/film noir style. The result is a slick production that admittedly is not for everyone, but fans of either genre will almost certainly like it.<br /><br />This film makes sense within its own internal logic, and there's a lot going on in the background/under the surface that will become more apparent with repeated viewings. If you need everything spelled out for you in simplistic, linear fashion, you will almost certainly find this film confusing.<br /><br />Indeed, one of my biggest faults with the film is that TOO MUCH is given away at the beginning with the opening voice-over (which was wisely removed for the Director's Cut.) The other complaint I have: when we finally get to the climax and coda, it was actually a little  too over-the-top for my taste. That's just personal preference, and others may be more satisfied by the pay-off. Even then, I'm willing to overlook these (and a few other flaws) and enjoy the holistic effect: the total of enjoyment was greater than sum of individual parts. This is close to 5-star material, and with a little leniency from the viewer could easily reach that level. Indeed, I would give the DC 5 stars as it solves one of my major complaints (the opening narration spoiled to much) and adds a few extra scenes that do help flesh things out.<br /><br />Obviously, this film is not for everyone. However, I'd say it's worth watching at least once.
B000002OX3|4.0|This was just the second album for the Who and they were experimenting with different sounds.Pete Townshend was always the Who's main song writer but on this album special arrangements were made to pay advances for song writing and each member of the band wrote a couple songs. Most notable was John Entwistle's bass heavy \\"Boris The Spider\\" which became a staple of their live performances. Keith Moon wrote a rather bizarre instrumental \\"Cobwebs And Strange\\" which uses various unusual instruments not normally associated with rock and roll. Pete Townshend did make an early attempt at a rock opera, an idea that was not yet fully developed \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\" has 6 parts and clocks in at just over 9 minutes. There are several curious cover songs also, including Martha Reeves and the Vandella's \\"Heatwave\\" and the Batman TV theme. I would recommend this album for Who fanatics, but if you are just a casual listener more fimiliar with the Who's later material this may not be for you.

B000JVT1U0|4.0|I wasted an afternoon when the newer version came out.  Nicholas Cage was not enough to salvage it.  When I read that Christopher Lee said that the original Wicker Man was his favorite of all the movies that he had made, I rented it. The original version is sinister where the sequel is pityingly laughable.  The songs, which were a bit distracting the first time, became assets on subsequent viewings.  (like the piano piece from The Bad Seed)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Some movies are just too wild, too rambunctious, too drunk on movieness to be comprehended in a normal theatrical run, and Baz Luhrmann's MOULIN ROUGE is one of the latest models.<br /><br />It's impossible to imagine what the ticket-buying viewers of this attention-deficit meta-musical were expecting, but chances are it wasn't what they got: an in-your-face, anachronistic debauch so absurdly designed and festooned with frippery it makes any Madonna road show look like a game of three-card monte. Even if you've seen and survived Luhrmann's ROMEO + JULIET, you've never seen anything like this before. It's the Hollywood equivalent of a shaken-up case of canned champagne.<br /><br />In the theater, the film came at you like a volley of cannonballs, and even in the back row you could get whiplash. At home, Luhrmann's wacky pyrotechnics will be more easily digested -- the DVD format might be the only way to make the world safe for this movie.<br /><br />Ostensibly set at the turn of the century in Paris, when the titular nightclub was gaining eminence, MOULIN ROUGE revolves around the doomed romance of consumptive star Nicole Kidman and penniless writer Ewan McGregor (and revolve it does, at 100 rpm). Luhrmann edited the movie in a full-blown montage fever, mixing in contemporary songs (by Elton John, Nirvana, Madonna, et al) and jumbling fantasy and reality so that, in the end, it isn't a movie so much as a speed-rock daydream of tragic love, musical impertinence and smiling moons.<br /><br />Make sure to rewind often, because there'll be tons of stuff you'll miss (including a TITINIC dig); at the very least you'll never be able to listen to \\"Your Song\\" the same way again.

See what happens when they try to match wits with Harvey a 6'4\\" invisible rabbit who happens to be Dowd's imaginary best friend.  Dated, yet timelessly charming.
B00122V360|5.0|It's a shame this movie didn't get more play as I think it's a great little romance with a sprinkle of comedy.  The soundtrack is a great mix.  I haven't played it all the way through, but everytime a song comes on my iPod shuffle and I say 'wow..this is good...what's this from?'... it invariably comes from here.     Haley Bennet (sic) as the spoiled teen rock idol is very talented and also unfortunately I don't think got a deserved boost from this role.    Worth getting the whole album.

I bought the DVD when my VHS finally wore out; it's definitely a must-have for any musical lover.
B000VAPZM2|1.0|Parents: on the surface, HSM 2 impersonates a virtuous, family-friendly vehicle which spares your children from unhealthy influences and suggestions (promiscuous/premarital/swinging sex, drugs, gangs, alcohol, violence), but after fair and balanced analysis, it ONLY LOOKS that way. Beneath its surface of bubble-gum \\"innocence\\" and triviality lies a hotbed of SIN (both mortal, venial) that the malevolent liberals who monopolize the entertainment world are hiding from you in plain sight, but still selling to your kids. No fear, however!!!! I've done all the grueling, analytical work, in place of lazy and careless parents who don't give a damn, to outline precisely all the SINS in HSM 2 so you parents can shield your kids from this hostile influence.<br /><br />Under the fiendish guise of  promoting to teens activities that are healthy and the opposite of the destructive influences usually peddled on teens from our liberal media and pop culture, HSM 2 endorses dancing!!!! It's not just dancing...it's the even more effeminate mischief of Broadway-style musical numbers and the uncontrollable urge to break out in show tunes at horridly timed places all over the movie. Because of this severely emasculating element, HSM 2 runs the risk of potentially turning some formerly male, teen viewers into you-know-whats.<br /><br />Mark my words: HSM 2 and movies like it are really a clandestine, feminist plan to emasculate what little \\"maleness\\" our modern society still has left!!!! For goodness sake, if you don't know, Zac Efron (Troy) even unabashedly wears makeup in real life--just look at his bizarre, coifed appearance at premieres. Intellectually honest people will readily admit that America in the 21st century is already on its way to being turned into a limp-wristed society due to all the women who \\"whip\\" their men. Well, HSM 2 takes that feminist ideology and targets it to impressionable, male teens. Where male teens ought to have their masculinity encouraged by developing their leadership, athleticism and self-reliance, HSM 2 schemes to take this away from them, especially with all the Zac Efron singing and dancing.<br /><br />A misdirected fantasy among some parents is HSM 2 encourages kids to develop their talents and \\"be themselves\\" (even if that \\"self\\" is rather effeminate!). However, look more analytically and you'll find HSM 2 actually promotes nothing but materialism and superficial attractiveness which are bane for a society, because one should ideally judge people by their character, not how they look or how great their clothes are.<br /><br />As such, HSM 2 is a catastrophic, ethical abuser in that its young \\"stars\\" are marketed in the roles of their characters as perfectly groomed; into the latest, trendy fashions; and more attractive than you'll find in run-of-the-mill high schools all over the US (trust me, I check out teens in high schools always). The Corbin Blue and Efron characters dress like little, perfect models straight out of the Abercrombie and Finch catalogues (oops, my bad: Corbin Blue would be excluded since he's not white!)!!!! The worst offending characters as it concerns proselytizing kids with messages about materialism are Sharpay and Ryan. They snidely prance around in their Juicy Couture and Ralph Loren Polo, respectively, which makes kids of lesser socio-economic backgrounds feel worthless. Hasn't Disney yet learned that they should shield teens from the harsh reality of unequal income backgrounds and instead feed them unrealistic propaganda to make sure their feelings are spared??!!<br /><br />Perhaps, just perhaps...the most affronting contravention is the shocking amount of F-L-E-S-H that HSM 2's nubile and supple, teen actors expose and brandish as they skimpily bound around the screen in mock perkiness, which sees their corresponding body parts bouncing along. For an allegedly wholesome movie, HSM 2 showcases many young, coming-of-age girls who wear bathing suits and sleeveless/strapless outfits!!!! Parents, it gets much worse as some of these same, nubile girls who are hopefully still virgins in real life show cleavage--and this movie's targeted to tweens!!!! WTF?!?!<br /><br />Yet another area of discomfort relates to Troy and Gabriella's rebelliousness throughout the film! Is Disney plotting to glorify teen disobedience of rules and authority, or what? I'm talking about Troy and Gabriella breaking country club rules by going skinny dipping in the pool at night, though they well know staff members are prohibited from such mischief! I'm also talking about the same, two characters picnicking on the golf course when they know trouble awaits them if discovered!!!!<br /><br />In closing, I just must express my distaste at the real-life, personal turmoil that one of the most horrid examples to young kids and people in general exhibits. I'm, clearly, pointing my righteous finger at Vanessa Hudgens who earlier this year was divulged as a sexual miscreant for salaciously posing nude in pictures which got leaked onto the internet!!!!

B0013D8LOK|4.0|Stephen Sondheim's \\"Sweeney Todd\\" will go down as one of the greatest musicals that Broadway has ever produced -- it was revolutionary in 1979 and inovated the musical genre. Sondheim will go down as the greatest composer of theatre and maybe the best composer of the 20th century. \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is great theatre. Now, Tim Burton, has created another type of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" which is more dramatic and beautifully photographed with hand drawn Art Direction. Although I enjoyed this film on another level, my major criticisms is the elimination of the \\"Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\" which was used as a device to tell parts of the story between the scenes and relief from the dark and dreary homocidal blood and guts. Burton made the film a realistic and grim experience while the musical play had a charm and a theatricality that let you know this was art. I can't watch the killings in this movie -- they are way too brutal.    Helen Bonham Carter, gives us a great dramatic performance, but delivers very weak vocals. \\"The Worst Pies in London\\" should have been a great opening number for her -- and her rhythm is off. Again the humor is gone and it should have been there. \\"A Little Priest\\" should have been a show stopper (like it was on Broadway) -- and the number is so truncated that it just sneaks in. The opening of the restaurant was Angela's big number on stage -- and Helen has a quick four minute number. Helen Bonham Carter does add a nuance with her acting (which was never realized in the Stage version) when Toby sings, \\"Not While I'm Around,\\" Mrs. Lovett realizes that they will have to kill Toby because he figures out their \\"operation.\\" Dramatically Carter is brilliant!    The showcase is the music and the film misses much of that. So much of Mr. Sondheim's magnificent composition is missing. We had a brilliant duet with Johanna and Anthony (\\"Ah Miss\\") that was combined with \\"Ladies and Their Sensitivities\\" which involved the Beadle and the Judge. Four voices going at once -- which was so brilliantly staged -- all gone. I would like to know what idiot made the decision to remove the \\"Ballad of Sweeney Todd.\\"  If this piece was left in place, the audience would have been able to catch their breath after watching Johnny Depp slicing throats!    Johnny Depp was wonderful and did a very good job vocally. He created his own Sweeney and came up with one we have never seen before. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and purchased it for my library. I also have the 1981 version of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn. If you want to watch great Art Direction and cinema -- put on Burton's version. If you want to see great theatre and hear the way Sondheim wrote it -- put on the Stage version.
B0010X745K|2.0|Two hours worth, mind you. Vacant, gory, cgi-laden snoozer. Marcia Gay Harden does the best she can as a religious nutcase, somewhat satisfying to see her die but other than that this is boring as all get-out. I'm starting to wonder-does King get lost in translation, or is the source material bad and I didn't notice as a kid?

6305291446|1.0|This was a strange move by Dimension, who had picked up the \\"Halloween\\" franchise. The first Dimension \\"Halloween\\", part 6 \\"The Curse Of Michael Myers\\", was a great film - before the last third was reshot due to the postfilming death of Donald Pleasance. In order to keep the series going, they needed a new ending, which almost destroyed the movie. Then they came out with this one, which bizarrely ignores everything that had happened in parts 4, 5 and their own 6 (in fact I believe \\"H20\\" also pretty much threw out part 2, but I'm not certain about it). And...why? To...accomplish what? I have no idea why Dimension, usually a first-rate company, would just give the middle finger to not only \\"Halloween\\" fans but also the artists who contributed to the series. Makes no sense.<br />Well, it may have been forgivable had \\"H20\\" been a great film. But it wasn't even a good film, and the much hyped return of Jamie Lee Curtis didn't amount to anything more than that, hype. \\"H20\\" is a mess of a movie, a standard glossy Hollywood shocker in that already dated \\"Scream\\" mold. There's a bunch of young actors and actresses doing absolutely nothing, and there's so many of those \\"fake scares\\" - I believe about 287 of 'em - that it simply becomes annoying in the extreme. \\"H20\\" is not only not scary, it's boring and irritating.<br />Most of the longtime \\"Halloween\\" fans don't consider \\"H20\\" or it's equally crappy followup \\"Halloween: Resurrection\\" to be canonical entries in the series; by ignoring the Myers mythology, what other conclusion can be drawn? And say what you will about Zombie's remake; at least it is a good, disturbing little flick. But \\"H20\\" and \\"Resurrection\\" are just terrible commercial products designed to make a quick buck.<br />Avoid.
B000MRAAJW|3.0|I ordered the product twice.  Once on my original order then replaced it.  Both copies ad discs that would not read in my HD DVD player.  The first three discs are fine, but the fourth is bad. The videos are great, but I can't watch the fourth disc of the set.

B0014BECF8|4.0|its such a delight to own this cd collection, costing a fraction of what its worth. gm's--talent, in his lyrics, music, and delivery seems so missed by many.  i love the dvd too, because the videos and concert tapings are never dull or lacking in imagination. inspiring, sexy, upbeat, thought provoking or perhaps longing with sadness, the honesty and rawness is solid all the way thru. sold seperately, i highly recommend the dvd as well as the cd.
0743486285|4.0|This is a Rock book. The graphic design feels like Dave Navarro's book and some of the text is similar to the Motley Crue DIRT book, but it stands on its own as well. If you're a Crue fan, this is a read for the real fans.<br />And the book is very heavy as well(in weight!)
B000TGJ8IU|3.0|The extra footage gives this movie room to breathe and improves the pacing. The many changes in the soundtrack are a GREAT improvement: the \\"wailing woman\\" is kept to a minimum and is therefore more appropriate when it does appear. Watching this DC of the movie made me wish, yet again, that studios would release the cut the director wanted to start with. The movie also looks a lot better - brighter, clearer and without the \\"antiquing\\" tint.    This is a better version of \\"Troy\\" than the theatrical release, but it is still the same movie. It has not been totally transformed, like the DC of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", which elevated it to masterpiece status, IMHO, but it is better and more enjoyable. I would say that Odysseus benefits the most from the extra scenes.

0767827902|5.0|Loosely based on gossip and scandal that surrounded various residents of Larry McMurtry's hometown of Archer City, Texas, the novel THE LAST PICTURE SHOW was much admired by critics--but didn't really explode into public conciousness until adapted to the screen, when it became one of the cinematic touchstones of the generation that had shed 1950s mores in favor of less restrictive attitudes.<br /><br />The film has no plot per se: it is simply a portrait of those who live in and around Anarene, Texas--a tiny town in the middle of nowhere that is slowly but surely dying.  It most particularly focuses on three high school students and their various travails.  Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) are best friends, play on the high school foot ball team, and both lust after the same girl--the very rich and extremely superficial Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd.)  Like most teenagers, they are all eager to climb into the back seat of car... but their hormones have unexpected consequences.<br /><br />The cast of characters spiral out from these three.  Through Sonny and Duane we meet Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), who owns the local cafe, pool hall, and picture show, and his sexy waitress and cook Genevieve (Eileen Brennan); through Jayce we meet her embittered and flamboyant mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn); and then there is the coach's wife, the painfully lonely and unhappy Ruth (Cloris Leachman.)  Although sex is a major catalyst in their various collisons, the real tragedy of their lives is the town, which is essentially a microsm of American hypocrisy, ennui, and failure.<br /><br />At the time, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW's frankess about sex was considered nothing short of scandalous; today it is merely so-so.  But the overall portrait of the characters as the struggle against the emptiness of their lives and their community remains as powerful as ever, and few films have delivered such a powerful ensemble cast.  The film essentially made the careers of everyone associated with it, brought Academy awards to Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman, and was nominated for virtually every award going.  It also put director Peter Bogdonavich on the map in a very major way.<br /><br />The DVD offers several bonuses, most particularly a \\"making of\\" piece in which Bogdonavich and such stars as Leachman, Brennan, and Burstyn recall the intensity of the shoot.  The transfer is very nice, beautifully preserving the memorable black and white cinematography by Robert Surtees and production design by Polly Platt.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerdemy awards to Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman, and was nominated for virtually every award going.

0060558121|5.0|One could draw parallels between Neil Gaiman's AMERICAN GODS and Alexis de Tocqueville's DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA.  Just as the latter was an analysis of the character of American politics by an outsider, so the former is an exploration of American spiritual beliefs by an outsider.  Some might object to the novel's insistence that this is a bad country for the gods.  This is, after all, a profoundly Christian nation and in the seven years since the book's publication we've witnessed an unprecedented intrusion of fundamentalist Christianity into national polity, as Bush appointees have structured policy around their own narrow religious beliefs (NPR only a couple of weeks ago broke the story of a highly praised, politically conservative Department of Justice official being fired because of suspicions that she is a lesbian).<br /><br />But I think Gaiman is largely correct.  In America the land itself precluded many of the beliefs that had been accorded to the various gods in predecessor cultures in Europe, Africa, and Asia.  But also America has had a largely profane approach to life, even in many Christian arenas.  I remember vividly a number of years ago attending as the guest of a dead friend a service at First Baptist Church of Dallas and hearing the minister state in his sermon \\"The American Free Enterprise System is the only economic system ordained by God\\" and that \\"Great Britain is under the judgment of God because it has socialized so many aspects of its government.\\"  If this isn't a bald attempt to make sacred the utterly profane, I don't know what is.  It is impossible to imagine a Christian in any other corner of the world in any historical epoch since the time of Christ uttering a similar proclamation.<br /><br />In one way this novel should have been impossible.  A bald description -- that a recently freed convict would be hired as a gofer by the Norse God Odin in anticipation of a war between the old Gods and the new American Gods -- points to a book that is not only highly improbable, but simply beyond the ability of any writer to execute.  Yet Gaiman not only wrote this book, but made it riveting and endlessly satisfying.  He produces a string of memorable characters and situates them concretely in an America I both recognize and want to explore.  I loved the conceit that many tourist traps were actually constructed because they were situated on places of great power.  I'd like to think that there is some excuse for the horror that is Mt. Rushmore.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.  Though written by an Englishman, this is one of the best novels about America that I have ever read.  He writes in his afterward that several people contributed in eliminating Anglicisms.  They certainly did a good job because one will be hard pressed to find any.  On a side note I was fascinated that the album I was listening to most frequently as I read the book was the Magnetic Fields' 69 LOVE SONGS, which in the same afterward he stated was the album he was listening to while he wrote it.  But since the novel was about the gods and the magical it seemed somehow divinely ordained that I'd just happen to be learning to love that album while reading a novel written by someone learning to love it.ly improbable, but simply beyond the ability of any writer to execute.

0887307280|5.0|After reading hundreds of business books....\\"The e Myth\\" is one of only five I recommend.  If I had read before starting my first business....it would have saved me millions of dollars.  I always keep extra copies to give away.    Stop reading all the trend books about business...this book will change the way you do everything.  By explaining what drives the entrepreneur from the beginning, the cycle we all fall into, and the path out of destruction, no other book is necessary.  THE BOOK IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The film is only a year younger than me but it looks so much better! :) Seriously, the transfer is great, especially considering the really disappointing first DVD release from 2001 (which luckily the Criterion Edition later corrected). The included documentary about making the film is fun to watch (this is one \\"Making of\\" that is more fun than some feature films). I just hope the other Python movies get the same treatment. I for one can't wait to have the complete set on Blu-Ray. Hail Brian!
0307237702|4.0|I loved Obama before I even read the book, so my review is probably already a little biased. Obama is a deep thinker and from the book it is obvious that he has spent a great deal of time pondering the problems facing our country.     Ironically I was probably more left-leaning before I read the book and Obama's take on things actually propelled me more toward the political center. He explains the rational and motives and hopes and dreams of both the left and the right and how really the value systems aren't all that different. Just one side tends to emphasize one set of values over the other. The real task is then to not be dogmatic about our political ideology but instead use judgement to navigate the complex trade-off that exist in each situation. Obama gives plenty of examples of this, and he makes me proud to be American where discussion like this is taking place and people really are working toward a better world.

B00151HZME|5.0|With \\"Saturdays = Youth\\" M83 attempts to evoke the fiery emotions of the adolescent heart throughout, from music to lyrics to packaging.  They succeed in crafting a dusky, summer evening album that will provide me with perfect listening for when I contemplate what it was like to be 14 to 17 years old, thinking I was in love but still not knowing how to approach such feelings from any other perspective than that of a child.      This music causes me to think of times in the neighborhood or in the park, particularly those times when the summer evening games of childhood began their evolution into times at once magical, thrilling and terrifying.  Something wondrous was happening, and it was all about learning of major changes along the route to adulthood.  The subtle undercurrents of sexual tension and longing that permeate \\"Saturdays = Youth\\" remind of things I have not felt for years, therefore I find this CD invigorating.    If you like lush electronic musical textures with subtle guitars here and there, soft-edged vocals and some heady grooves you will probably enjoy the way this album sounds.  There are few moments of panic here.  It is for the most part pastoral and relaxing, but it is nonetheless full of adrenaline due to the inner tension created through the way the music has been written and played.       M83 leader Anthony Gonzalez likes to write about youth, and I believe this album represents not only the band's most musically focused work to date, but also its most focused work in terms of emotions; he and M83 help lost memories of youth come alive.  When I was in my early-mid teens, popular music sounded a lot different than what I hear on this disc, but M83 captures some of those past emotions for me.  After all, such feelings never really die.  If you look far enough down inside, you will find such feelings still hiding, asking to be let out.  \\"Saturdays = Youth\\" may help you bring some of these feelings up for air.  Listen to this CD, and let your feelings breathe.

B0010X73ZG|1.0|About 60% of this movie was decent, but the religious zealot was way overdone and extremely cliche and annoying.  My main problem with this movie is the ending.  Honestly, there should be a warning on the case.  The fact that they had the father kill his child is repulsive and intolerable.  This dvd isn't going to the resale shop, it already went right into the trash.
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|When I first watched this movie in the theater, I came out totally disappointed and disgusted and wanted my time and money back. Now, after watching it again on DVD, I have changed my opinion somewhat.    The story is actually pretty good with Picard rebelling against the Federation for what he thinks is right (Prime Directive) - his career be damned! And the Son'a, the exiled children of the Ba'ku, seeking revenge on their parents and using the Federation to help them is an interesting idea. The crew feels natural and you can sense a real chemistry between them in this movie. The acting is top-notch, especially by the main Son'a villain Ad'har Ru'afo. The relationship between Picard and the Ba'ku woman Anij is very intriguing as well.    The thing that bothers me about this one is the humor. I guess the intent was to go back to a light-hearted movie like \\"The Voyage Home,\\" but the humor doesn't work well in this movie like it did in \\"Voyage.\\" In \\"Voyage,\\" the crew were on a past Earth with no imminent threat, so the humor fit in since they weren't under any real pressure. But with \\"Insurrection,\\" the crew is under attack from the Son'a and the humor seems out of place and awkward in light of the urgency of their situation. Not to mention some of the jokes are very cheesy - Data is a personal flotation device?! Huh?    So, altogether a good story with great acting but some misplaced (and sometimes cheesy) humor really disrupts the flow of the story and the feeling of threat and urgency. Not the worst of the Star Trek movies (\\"The Final Frontier\\" still holds that distinction for me), but an average one.

The extra material, about 11 tunes, is top notch, not to be missed 5 star stuff.  The semi-acoustic \\"Born in the USA\\" is haunting, and dispells any myth as to what the song is really about.  Well worth a purchase.  The Boss and the E Street Band in concert are always a treat.
0060090383|5.0|This book is very different from Marian Keyes' other novels:  it covers a serious subject seriously.  It takes Rachel Walsh from a madcap and unhappy life in New York into the dingy realm of The Cloisters, Ireland's rehab center to the stars, only she doesn't find stars there.  Instead, she finds the reality of the life she was leading, its unhappiness, its descent into drug and alcohol abuse out of tremendous insecurity and the harm she has done to her best friend and her boyfriend.    The scenes at The Cloisters are sometimes hard to read, because this book is all done in Rachel's interior monologue through her own eyes and filters, and as the filters she has used to excuse her behavior disappear, she starts to feel pain and the reader feels it along with her.  But you also get the insight Rachel attains.  In one powerful scene, she discovers that her group leader had learned so much about human nature by having been an addict herself, and you can see Rachel's superficial belief that people who suffer from addiction are losers disappear.    I hope that the real institutions on which Keyes based this novel are better at preparing their charges for their return to normal daily life than The Cloisters prepared Rachel.  Even though her counsellor had identified her parents' lack of regard for Rachel as a source of the low self-esteem, she is dumped on her family with no preparation on either part, no job, no set counselling sessions, no identified AA or NA group to go to, no Al-Anon for the family members.  Predictably, she begins to fail, but less predictably, her disastrous date with Chris starts her on the road to healing.    If I have one criticism of the book, it is that the last six or so pages are unnecessary.  I refer to what happens in the title of the review, and it is much of a muchness with the end of all of Keyes' novels.  But if you throw those last six pages away, it is still the same novel and Rachel's transformation becomes more a matter of her own self-awareness and personal growth and depends less on her ability to attract a man.  I wish Keyes had had the self-confidence to realize that she didn't need to end the book the way she did.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|I had never watched Doctor Who (a bit too British and strange for my taste) but I'm always watching BBC America and accidentally saw the last episode of the latest Dr. Who which got me interested in Tochwood.  It's not as one-note as the X-files which I loved the first two years and then got sick of it. Torchwood has great special effects, a lot of humor and pizazz.  Some of the plots are far-fetched and it's a bit hard to understand the Welsh accent on a first view, but it's great fun.  And of course Capt. Jack is gorgeous which helps a lot.  I was kind of upset that the DVD is letterbox format with two black bars cutting the top and bottom.  Season Two just ended and I hope it will continue for many more seasons.  Bess in the Big Apple.
B000002P2V|5.0|1978's \\"Who Are You\\" was not the end of The Who, but it was certainly the end of an era for the band, as their superb, madman drummer Keith Moon would sadly die from an accidental overdose right after the album's release. \\"Who Are You\\" seems to get a mixed reaction from fans---some love it, but some think The Who weren't really firing on all cylinders with this one. \\"Who Are You\\" came out at the height of both punk and disco, and it's been said that The Who were basically caught in the crossfire of both genres in 1978, and sounded on this album a little bit \\"confused\\" about their own identity, and where they fit in the musical spectrum of the day. Hence, the album title. My opinion is that, despite the changing musical landscapes of 1978---and despite both Keith Moon's and guitarist Pete Townshend's problems in their respective personal lives at the time---the band still summoned up an excellent album.  I think \\"Who Are You\\" is a great Who album, with lots of great, catchy material. The title song is the signature tune on the album, and rightfully so---it's a memorable rocker that has never left the Who's concert setlist to this day. All the other songs stand up too, including \\"New Song,\\" \\"Sister Disco\\" (the band's swipe at the disco craze), the opera-influenced \\"Guitar And Pen,\\" the beautiful \\"Love Is Coming Down,\\" the late-night vibe of \\"Music Must Change,\\" and bassist John Entwistle's strong trio of numbers, \\"905,\\" \\"Had Enough,\\" and the dirty rocker \\"Trick Of The Light.\\" All the band members are in fine form: Roger Daltrey's powerful singing voice, Townshend & Entwistle's respective songwriting, musical & vocal chops, and although Keith Moon's drumming wasn't *quite* what it used to be---he'd put on weight, and he could only play cymbals on \\"Music Must Change\\" because he simply could not get behind the song's time signature---he still drums on this album with his unique, excellent flair (and his ferocious drumming on the closing, classic title song becomes a fabulous finale for this legendary drummer). The Who would bravely soldier on after Moon's untimely death, and they would still make great music together (three more studio albums to date, and various tours), and Daltrey & Townshend are still keeping the Who flag flying after the further tragic loss of John Entwistle in 2002, but \\"Who Are You\\" represents the last stand by the classic Who line-up. The first chapter in the Who's impressive musical career comes to a close on an exceptionally high note with \\"Who Are You,\\" a Who classic.
0385493622|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It explains the search for a solution to one of the greatest mathmatical riddles in history.  It goes deep into the creation of Andrew Wiles' solution.  Plus, it only requires your attention to get past all the math.  Knowledge of math beyond high school algebra and geometry isn't needed!  The harder math is described enough for us non-mathematicians to get the idea and then move along with the story.    The start of the book sets the stage for Fermat's ideas.  The work of the ancient Greeks is described so that Fermat is put into a good context.  Then we get to know Fermat himself and his times.  After that the book goes in two directions.  It both describes the efforts of others to solve Fermat's Theorem and also gives background information on mathematicians how created concepts that would be later used to finally solve it.  Brief biographies are given on dozens of fascinating minds and, as a result, the quest for a proof has all sorts of romance, tragedy, success, and brilliance.    The book finishes up with Andrew Wiles making his final steps to a proof and the pressures it placed upon him.  I learned a great deal in this book, have been inspired to reacquaint myself with math, and used many pieces of the book to help me teach my high school history course.  Thanks for the appendix and well done.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|I did not expect to like this movie as much as I did. I am ( sorry everyone) not a huge Johnny Depp fan or even Tim Burton for that matter, BUT this movie may have changed my mind. What an amazing production, I loved the grays and the dark mood ( perfect October-time movie) and the surreal switch of scenes to colorful happier memories or wishful daydreams.<br />I won't recap the story as I am sure other reviewers before me have done so.<br />Johnny Depp has an absolutely gorgeous and evocative singing voice, and in many of his movies I have found him cold and wooden but, not in this. His eyes, his body language...this may well be one of the roles he was always meant to play. And frankly, I think he looks better now as a man than he did as a boy. His pretty face is now chiseled and interesting.<br />Helena also has a beautiful singing voice but half of her lyrics were lost. I could not understand a word she was singing!<br />The actress who played Johana....angelic. Her voice like a crystal bell and could bring you to tears. The sailer boy who saves her...another gifted singer. Alan Rickman, an actor who can play any and everything, captured the sinister judge.<br />Oh, and Sasha Cohen! I had heard some negatives about him, but I disagree. He was wonderful and quirky, sang great! Along with the urchin... I guess I have to say all around every performance was terrific.<br />I just had to dock a star because it was, for me, wayyyyyyy too bloody. I would have preferred the beatings and the murders alluded to, not shown. But that is me. I just closed my eyes during those parts so I could continue listening to the sublime score.<br />The costumes were vividly strange, and even Helena's ratty hair style worked! Seems pretty impossible to make that gorgeous creature look bad, even with the painted black circles around her eyes, she is a knockout goth babe.<br />Make SURE to watch the extra feature, there is a mini documentary in the DVD with interviews with Johnny, Helena, the director, the producer and others. Great behind the scenes shots of them filming, of creating the sets and costumes, and the 2 leads talking about their first singing parts ( this movie). I thought the documentary was as good as the movie itself!<br />NOW I am definatly going to get the Broadway stage DVD with Angela<br /> Landsbury, who, by all accounts, set the bar for this part.<br />PS- my favorite scene and song was when Johnny Depp was singing to his razors.

0307265730|5.0|I have to admit that I was waiting this book for many months and I started reading it with a preconceived albeit subconscious notion that the literary journey I'm about to embark upon is one of immense finesse and depth. Some might argue that this mindset might cast a cloak on the negative qualities of the novel thereby making the stories more appealing. I've thought about this and beg to differ. Expectations of this height are hard to live by and many a (famous) novel have fallen short. Unaccustomed Earth did not.   What attracts me to her work is the fact that I can often find traces of myself and people I know in them. It's comforting to know that your trials and fears are not unique, that there can be meaning even in the mundane, mystery in the seemingly known. What started off with The Interpretor of Maladies, continued with The Namesake and found fruition in Unaccustomed Earth is a sensitive yet intense rendering of the intricate working of the heart and mind. In \\"Only goodness\\" a sister deals with guilt and concern over her kid brother's alcoholism. This was perhaps the most poignant story of the 8-story collection. Lahiri has a way of drawing the readers into the minds of her characters and making them a part of the thought process, both said and unsaid. It was like Sudha's growing concern and guilt, her embarrassment at her wedding, her longing for him when he disappears, her sheer panic at finding her baby alone in the tub and her  final resolve to prioritize her child and husband's needs over her brother's as if they were all mine.   What makes Lahiri's characters so lovable is that they're not perfect. They don't always do or say the right things. Many among us have fallen hard for the wrong man like Sang does in Nobody's Business. Many among us have felt an attraction outside wedlock like in Hell-Heaven. Many among us have even been caught between the sense of responsibility towards parents vs wanting to hold on to our independence and known way on lifeas Ruma does in the tittle story. Fate, death, passion, confusion, a search for isolation, rebellion have been as much a part of our lives as they have of Hema and Kaushik's in the trio of stories at the end.   The prose is packed with emotional wisdom. The only not so positive quality that struck me is the sameness of the cultural backgrounds of the characters -- all highly educated Bengalis. The central theme is how these people deal with the crosscurrents of traditions and displacement of identity, how they strive to define their individuality and how they fight to cling on to the familiar. Assumptions are often negated and they are forced to deal with their new environs and new set of truths.   Yes, one might argue that \\"nothing happens\\" but how often do life altering incidents happen in our lives anyway? Isn't life woven from single treads of everyday experiences, simple joys, of innocence, attachments and fears?
B00104QSOM|4.0|'There will be Blood' has much to commend it and justly deserves the credits its attracted. Day-Lewis's performance is a rare achievement and compels our viewing throughout. I found the score and settings wonderful, especially the opening sequence that could have been shot just south of our town. However, the drag for me was the simplistic pairing of the oil tychoon and the Preacher, whose sanctimonious, smirking face is every bit on a par with the oil man's squinting, ambitious gaze. This is moralizing plain and square, departing from the more subtle variations that are found in the book,'Oil' from which it is taken. Siad book also makes more of the twin brother, whose early appearance sets our tychoon on the sent of oil further west. The movie makes so little of him that at first it is confusing when his preacher brother is introduced. Whatever,the last 15 minutes sinks the film into ludicrous realms, and as if the bold print wasn't dark enough, surely, 'there will be blood'. Long before though, all souls have been dammned.

1416914293|3.0|I enjoyed the first one in this series, until the very end of the book, so I was waiting for this to come out to see how things ended up. While things are still up in the air, not much has changed. It's an entertaining read, a little predictable, and a little frustrating at parts when you know the characters should be expecting certain things to happen or asking particular questions that are right in their faces, but overall it held my interest. I'm still curious to see how things will end up!
0451457994|5.0|Because Arthur C. Clarke recently died I decided to reread his classic novel, 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Some people say that the major knock against science fiction is that it's necessarily dated soon after written because of the progress of society and technology.  While this may be true of many stories, 2001 is timeless.  It's hopeful, it's beautiful and it's filled with themes that speak to what we are as humanity.<br /><br />Evolution is probably the most important element of the story.  From the beginning when primitive man finds a black obelisk and it teaches the concept of tool use and subtly changes these creature's minds the idea that our improbable evolution was guided by alien intervention.  Then, just as humanity gained the power to destroy its own planet those same aliens had planned to help the descendants of those early creatures jump to the next step, as equal in advancement as using stones for tools were to starving primitives.  The message I took from the story was that we are limited in how forward we can think and until we break through another evolutionary barrier we'll be butting our heads against an invisible barrier on creativity.  It's profound and humbling to consider the possibility that there are beings who look at our restrictions as simplistic as we view the idea of making a fire for survival.<br /><br />Invariably this novel gets compared with the Stanley Kubrick film and rightly so.  Unlike any pair I've encountered, both the novel and screenplay were developed simultaneously and in conjunction.  With slight differences the stories are complementary and equally brilliant.  What makes me favor the book more than the movie is the ending, which is explained better revealing the true scope of the evolutionary step man is about to make.<br /><br /> - CV Rick, April 2008
B000TX7B5U|5.0|Serj's new solo CD rocks my world. He touches on great political issues and his songs have great meaning. That, and we still get the same loony voice and lyrics as we did with SOAD. I would give this CD a 10 if I could. The music itself without lyrics is awesome. A great add if you're a SOAD fan. Heck, a great add even if you aren't! Serj has made his own mark in the music industry with this CD. It's great that he can hold himself up seperately from the guys in SOAD. Go Serj!!!!!!!!!!
038551123X|5.0|As further evidence for my thesis that a full season of a television series is the perfect vehicle for the complexities of a novel, Darkly Dreaming Dexter was indeed made into the series, Dexter and kept mostly intact from book to season one.  When I found this out, I bought the book expecting a competent thriller.  What I got was much more.<br /><br />Dexter Morgan works in a laboratory for the Miami Police Department.  His forensic specialty is analyzing blood splatter, which fits in with his obsessions about blood perfectly, for he is also a serial killer.  In fact that's his main occupation.  Jeff Lindsay tells this story first person, through the voice and mind of Dexter.  He doesn't consider himself human because he doesn't have human emotions, or human cares.  He's been taught to channel his alter-ego, his \\"Dark Passenger,\\" to kill only those people who deserve death - those who prey on the innocent.<br /><br />Everything is going great with Dexter until the victims of another serial killer show up.  These victims appeal to Dexter, the murders are perfect and the murderer is playing a game with Dexter's Dark Passenger.  It's like a siren's call and his carefully crafted control breaks down.  Can Dexter control it or maybe he's already lost control and his Dark Passenger is loose without his conscious knowledge.<br /><br />It's a page turner.  Fast and gritty.  I'm glad I read it.<br /><br /> - CV Rick, April 2008

It came looking exactly as is shown above. Unlike a lot of Bob Marley CD's out there, this one has his most famous songs. Many other CD's claim to have his greatest hits, but only have a few. It also has a neat little booklet, explaining his life and his accomplishments. There are also lyrics in this booklet. I love this cd!! It is without a doubt the best of Bob!

0805079831|5.0|This is literally a life-changing book. After reading it, one's view of the world is changed forever, and the world suddenly makes sense in a way it never did before. What was inexplicable suddenly comes into sharp focus, and random evil now has a purpose and goal, and with that understanding comes the possibility of change.<br /><br />The book is about the Chicago School of Economics and its guru, Milton Friedman, and their effect on the world. Friedman advocated radically free markets. He called such markets pure, and stated that any government interference in the market corrupts it. Therefore he called for privatization of government assets, freedom from government regulations, and from trade barriers. Friedman's views were a response to the views of John Maynard Keynes, the economist behind the post WW II reconstruction efforts of Europe and Japan.<br /><br />The problem was that Friedman's vision of pure and free markets was not appealing to any but the wealthy; it seemed to offer few benefits to the middle and lower classes, the majority of voters in a democracy. So Friedman had difficulty getting any government to adopt his ideas.<br /><br />Enter the research of Ewen Cameron, a psychiatrist with impressive credentials. He believed that to create healthy new behaviors in patients he had to break up their old psychological patterns by breaking down their current structures. To do this , he used electroshock and drugs, including hallucinogens, and other techniques to \\"de-pattern\\" his patients. Many lost their memories and some became incapable of functioning normally... but the CIA became interested in the techniques as a method of mind control. Cameron's techniques, including isolation and sensory deprivation, became instruments of torture: \\"As a means of extracting information during interrogations, torture is notoriously unreliable, but as means of terrorizing and controlling populations, nothing is quite as effective\\" (p. 126).<br /><br />\\"It was in 1982 that Milton Friedman wrote the highly influential passage that best summarizes the shock doctrine: \\"Only a crisis -real or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believed, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\\" (p. 140) Crisis could create opportunity for drastic new measures to be introduced quickly, to cause such shock among the populace that they were incapable of acting counter to the new policies. So the ideas of Cameron and Friedman merged to exploit or create shocks that would allow governments to pursue doctrines that would never succeed democratically.<br /><br />The first true laboratory for the shock doctrine was the Pinochet coup in Chile against Allende, a coup backed by the CIA. \\"The shock of the coup prepared the ground for economic shock therapy; the shock of the torture chamber terrorized anyone thinking of standing in the way of the economic shocks.\\" (p. 71).<br /><br />There has to be a warning that this book will at times make the reader sick to his/her stomach... there are graphic depictions of torture. Yet the horror is not gratuitous, it is vital to understanding all that happened.<br /><br />The Chicago school triumphed in country after country, especially after they captured the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, those institutions ironically set up to carry out Keynesian ideas of reconstruction after disaster.<br /><br />The results in so many countries were the same. A small core of native elites and multinational companies profited enormously. But the percentage of the people living in poverty rose drastically, native industries disappeared, unable to compete, farms became bankrupt, unemployment soared and wages were depressed for those who still had a job. In South Africa and Poland, popular regimes elected to dismantle repressive regimes were forced to pay the debts of those old regimes, and to do so had to accept money from the IMF, with the attending requirements to adopt Friedman style economics.<br /><br />Much of the book is a detailed examination of the shock doctrine and its effects in country after country - the Southern Cone countries of Latin America, Poland, South Africa, Russia, China, Iraq, Israel... the list goes on and on. Finally the war in Iraq makes some sense: the idea was to \\"shock and awe\\" Iraq to create a tabula rasa, a clean slate upon which would be drawn a stable sound country, free economically and democratically, which would serve as a blueprint to remake the entire Middle East (it becomes clear that part of the draw of Islamic terrorist organizations, like the Mahdi Army and Hezbollah, is that these groups have provided basic services, like hospitals, schools, and garbage disposal, that governments were no longer providing).<br /><br />The shocks now even include natural disasters, with a disaster economy ready to go and to profit from them, perhaps most strikingly illustrated after the 2004 tsunami, when so many who relied on fishing for their living lost the beach front lands their families had owned for generations, to New Orleans, where public schools were not rebuilt and private schools became the norm. In Israel, the homeland security firms have become the backbone of the economy, driving a disinclination to secure peace.<br /><br />But in many places, especially Latin America where the shocks are beginning to wear off,. Such places are becoming resistant to further shock, having suffered the worst that shock could do.<br /><br />If you only read one book on current affairs, let it be this one. If you aren't interested in politics, manufacture an interest long enough to read this one book. Vital events are happening throughout the world that affect our lives, and the course this country decides to take for the future.

0812550757|2.0|I actually first read Ender's Game when I was in college, much later than when most sci-fi and fantasy buffs come across Card's classic. I actually started using it with students I tutored in middle school as a way of trying to get them hooked on reading. It almost always worked.     In Speaker for the Dead, Card fast forwards 3000 years. In the aftermath of Ender's victory over the buggers, instead of being honored as being a savior, he is vilified as one great murderer. The fault for this is his - after the final battle, Ender had gone off and found the hive queen and learned all about the bugger race, realizing that the buggers had never been enemies to begin with. He ends up writing a treatise that casts him as the villain and reshapes his own legacy. This book finds humans making contact with a new race and trying to correct the mistakes from the past.     Reading Card's sequel, although one has to use that term loosely, was both an entertaining and ultimately disappointing experience. Critics have hailed this as a better written book, which is hard to argue against. The moral and religious overtones are explicit, as are the attempts at showing the emotional depth and pain many of the characters feel. But is it better than its predecessor? Sadly, it does not even come close. The success of Ender's Game was in its innovation and creativity. Here, Card seems as if he's struggling to become more of a literary writer, a writer with something to say. His point of view is well-received, but it is too heavy-handed. He may as well have written a philosophical treatise.     Overall, you don't have to read this thread of the Ender series to have closure. Stick to Ender's Shadow and the more recent thread following Ender's brother than this and the two books that follow it.
B00154GEFU|2.0|In simple terms ASIA cannot be viewed from a \\"progressive rock\\" perspective. This CD, much like there early work, is more in line with AOR formulaic material like Journey or 38-Special, etc.    The positives for me were John Wetton's voice and the addition of Steve Howe's guitar playing. I say \\"addition\\" because, like a previous reviewer commented, this is basically a John Wetton/Geoff Downes album. His limited fills didn't carry the CD and I really felt he was like a guest player.    The negatives for me are formulaic song writing, ie. 80's style AOR rock, and incredibly unimaginative bass and drum playing. I guesss the rhythm section is indicative of AOR rock so if that is there goal fine they hit it but very boring to this listener. If there is any doubt about what an incredible bass player John Wetton is please listen to King Crimson and UK in the 70's, he is outstanding!! In terms of Carl Palmer ...... I don't know what to say but just very disappointing. Listen to virtually any hard rock drummer or modern prog drummer for more inspiring playing.    Given that there is so much interesting music out there (Riverside, IQ, Flower Kings, The Tangent, Lazuli, etc) I can't imagine buying another ASIA CD.     Please no one compare this to quality eary work by Yes, King Crimson or ELP.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|Firstly, I have to admit that Johnny Depp can do very little wrong as far as I can see.  He is one of the most capable actors of recent years and always strives to produce a performance like no other - never taking the easy options he relentlessly pursues roles that are interesting to himself and to his many fans.  Sweeney Todd is a masterpiece not only for Depp fans, but for anyone who can plug into the imagination of Tim Burton and turn the outside world off for a couple of hours and allow the dark gothic world of Mr. Burton take hold.      I can guarantee that the melodies and words of Sondheim will reverberate in your mind long after the movie has finished!  I think that most Tim Burton films contain a myriad of interesting facts and interviews relating to the filming, background and planning of the project and Sweeney is no exception.  The bonus material is excellent and I cannot wait for the Burton/Depp Cats collaboration - although holding my breath might well prove to be fatal!    A great achievement especially when considering that the cast had very little musical experience.  I'm certainly glad to have a copy in my collection.

0316067601|1.0|Marcus and his four member Seal team (operation Redwing) have been dropped on a mt. in the Hindu Kush, a mountain range located between Afghanistan and Pakistan, to scout out a Taliban Islamic militia leader whom he names Sharmak but I believe is actually Mullah Ismail, also known as Mullah Ahmad Shah.    Three goat herders stumbled upon their hiding place. And according to Marcus they took em in and then proceeded to debate what to do with them. Kill em or let em go. His was the breaking vote. He let them go.  Why? For fear of the liberal media, why of course. I kid you not. Marcus blames the whole tragedy and all the worlds woes on the liberals and this specific incident, his decision, on the liberal media. Is that bizarre or what?    Page 202.     \\"Mickey was thoughtful. \\"Listen Marcus. If we kill them, someone will find their bodies real quick. For a start, these f__g goats are just going to hang around. And when these guys don't get home for dinner, their friends and relatives are going to head straight out to look for them, especially for this fourteen-year-old. The main problem is the goats. Because they can't be hidden, and that's where people will look. When they find the bodies, the Taliban leaders will sing to the Afghan media. The media in the U.S.A. will latch on to it and write stuff about the brutish U.S. Armed Forces. Very shortly after that, we'll be charged with murder. The murder of innocent unarmed Afghan farmers.\\" I had to admit, I had not really thought about it quite like that. But there was a terrible reality about Mikey's words. Was I afraid of these guys? No. Was I afraid of their possible buddies in the Taliban? No. Was I afraid of the liberal media back in the U.S.A.? Yes.\\"      IMHO.The bad decision(s) was -   1. Not immediately calling HQ and advising them of the currant blown situation and requesting a quick extraction.   2. Letting the herdsmen go free...knowing full well that most  in the area were Taliban sympathisers or aiding andabetting  3. Not getting the heck out of the immediate area ASAP!!!!       Personally I don't see where there even was a decision to be made about the herdsmen, outside of TYING THEM UP, maybe incapacitating them further with morphine (U.S. carry morph. for emerg. pain), while you bugged out. Redwing's position was blown and that was that. Getting out of the area ASAP before the herdsmen's families came looking for them was the real and immediate issue/danger. Kill the herdsmen? What ever for? To what gain, what purpose?     Letting the herdsmen go free, as Marcus did, would not of even crossed my mind! I guess because unlike Marcus I'd be scared to death they'd run direct to the Taliban. But Marcus, as he stated on page 203, is not afraid of the Taliban, or anything else except...  the U.S. liberal media.     SEAL Team KILLED-in-action:  Lt. Michael P.

I realize that these guys come in off the streets with their own load (big & buff) and that it is probably (unfortunately) taught as part of the course  but this guy oozes and it should of been edited out.     His love for Bush et al. is nauseous. His hate for liberals childish. The writing is juvenile and does a disservice to all the men who died.     \\"Not to mention my own raging instincts, which had told me to go with Axe and execute them [the herdsmen] . And let the liberals go to h_ll in a mule cart, and take with them all of their f__g know-nothing rules of etiquette in war and human rights and whatever other b_s_ makes 'em happy.\\"    Bad instincts. What about training?    And Marcus talked to God. \\"In the air I made two complete backflips and I landed again feet first, on my back, still coming down the cliff face like a howitzer shell. And at that moment I knew there was a God. First of all, I appeared not to be dead, which was right up there with Jesus walking on the water. But even more amazing was I could see my rifle not two feet from my right hand, as if GOD HIMSELF had reached down to me and given me hope. Marcus, I heard Him say, you're gonna need this. I swear to God I heard Him. Because this was a miracle, no doubt in my mind. And I had not even had time to say my prayers.\\" ... and he rambles on.     On page 321 he says, after the villagers in Sabray-Minah brought his equip. back to him  \\"I grabbed my rifle and held it like you might caress a returning lover. THIS WAS THE WEAPON GOD HAD GRANTED ME. And, so far as I could tell, still wanted me to have. \\"    The book is just full of this stuff. It's embarrassing.     As far as fighting in the Middle East,  I don't think the special forces are turning out the right body type. Most of these guys are way too heavy.  Even Marcus unwittingly tells of the disadvantage of \\"being a great 230-pound hulk like myself, slipping and sliding, crashing and breaking branches, causing minor avalanches on the loose ground...\\".     Their strength doesn't come from 24/7 year after year decade after decade of hard life, hard work and hard fighting like the middle east fighters. It can't possibly.    From what I see the fighting men in the middle east are thin hardened straps of muscle. Small, light and agile. Marcus says: \\"they could move like rockets up in the passes\\"  \\"When the Afghans travel, they carry their guns and ammunition and nothing else. One guy carries the water for everyone; another hauls the extra ammunition. And this leaves the main force free to move very fast, very softly. They are born trackers, able to pick up a trail across the roughest ground, and they can walk right up on you.\\"    Even Marcus admits that they usually always called in air support. In other words they can't handle em one on one or rather group to group. They (taliban et. al.) have the home field advantage and hundreds of years of constant fighting experience.     And as for Marcuses undying, fawning love for the Bush family because they are fellow Texans.... The Bush family all come from the east coast (New Jersey, Ohio, Massachusetts, Connecticut). George H.W. Bush (born in Milton, Massachusetts) was in the oil business in Texas (1948). And GWB (Born in New Haven, Connecticut) later gov. That's it.  [...]    NOW Lyndon Baines Johnson, THERE'S YOUR TRUE TEXAN, Marcus. Johnson was born near Stonewall, Texas, on August 27, 1908, in a small farmhouse in a poor area on the Pedernales River. Descended from a pioneer Baptist clergyman who pastored some eight churches in Texas    \\"Luttrell, who left the Navy in June, acknowledged the way back has been difficult. He remains unsure how the SEAL community will accept him, with the publication of a book about the notoriously secretive force. BUT HE WANTED TO TELL HIS VERSION OF THE STORY BEFORE OTHERS CAME OUT.\\"  <Caps are mine.  HAH? WHAT OTHERS? They're all dead. Which means there is no one to substantiate Marcus's story. He claims the four of them killed half of Sharmak's men. That would mean the four of them killed 75 to 100 men. I find that hard to swallow along with a lot else.     And  Mohammad Gulab the Afghan who took Marcus under his villages protection   [...]      No disrespect to the SEALS. I just think Marcus is out there. Don't they do psychiatric evaluations on these guys?     All in all nineteen (?) people died behind this. Which is another thing. Why did they risk 16 more lives for 4.  Was it worth it? I think the military should  reassess its rescue operations.     If the \\"rules of engagement\\" are stupid, the 'leave no man behind' policy can be just as stupid. A Live man sure, if possible. But dead, NO. It's pure selfishness to expect another to risk his life to retrieve your live or dead body. War is war.  Sacrifice the living for the dead? Seems to me that's how to loose a war.

B000WTZ784|4.0|First and foremost, I am a non-commercial fan of Genesis...my favorites being the 70's progressive style of \\"Wind and Wuthering\\", \\"Trick of the Tail\\" and \\"Then There Were Three\\".  Though I like some tunes off of \\"Genesis\\" and \\"Invisible Touch\\", they do not rate nearly as high, and I certainly will not own \\"Abacab\\".  With that stated, I was eager to hear something a bit distant from the commercial 80's albums.         \\"Calling All Stations\\" is quite different and my expectations before listening to the album were wide open.  The title track is awesome, odd for an opening track, but the gut-wrenching voice of Ray Wilson was perfect for the dark melancholy tension this piece offers.  This title track is quite the prelude for the rest of the album which leaves you feeling numb upon completing the entire CD in one listening.  This is not a \\"pick-me-up\\" album and nothing resembles a top 40 tune except maybe \\"Congo\\"...but this doesn't say that there are not good tunes here.  \\"Congo\\" is powerful after the intro. and I catch myself singing the chorus from time to time.  \\"Shipwrecked\\" was the worst tune for me...a disolved relationship compared to a shipwreck is odd...and the negativity of the first three songs finally catches up here.  \\"Alien Afternoon\\" is two songs in one and both are catchy...especially the \\"alien\\" chorus of \\"We Are All Your Home\\"...I replay that section over again.  These first four songs are a \\"wall of sound\\", loaded with Tony Bank's layered keyboards.  The next number of songs kind of send you through a lull, nothing great but nothing dull.  You begin to sense that some of these songs are just a little too long.  I really liked \\"There Must Be Some Other Way\\" except for its lengthy verses...the instrumental section in the middle is a great jam, reminding me of \\"Second Home By the Sea\\" and I wished it was a lot longer!  As a matter of fact...I wished they would have spent less time on words and more time on Tony Bank solos (not to put down Ray Wilson's singing).  The last tune, \\"One Man's Fool\\" is a great finishing number...another two songs in one.         I rarely play the entire CD in one sitting these days...the melancholy of the music is draining.  I usually play tracks 1,2,4 10, and 11, and hit the other ones from time to time.  I wasn't crazy about the title track when I first heard it...now I find it such an effective intensive emotional song...it serves a purpose!  I feel Ray Wilson's voice was very adequate to the album.  I appreciated another reviewer's thoughts when he stated that if you can accept that this is not your normal Genesis album and can accept this as something totally new, you might like it.  With that said...I gave it a chance and it was worth it!
0823003035|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the correct way to draw the human figure in an accurate and realistic way. I went to art school in the early eighties and was never taught this approach to drawing and now that I have read this book my life drawing skills have improved immensely.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Even if you're not a Britney fan, if you have an open mind and enjoy music, you're bound to enjoy this album.  By far, it's one of her best. In fact, I'd even say this album beats out all other albums released by other artists  within the last couple years or more.
0805079831|5.0|After skimming the book and paying careful attention to the CDs of same, it appears that the American people have indeed earned the title \\"We, the Sheeple\\".  If Naomi Klien is even 50% accurate in what seems to be a very well documented review of Disaster Capitalism, we've been spectacularly \\"rope-a-doped\\" by the team of our top government officials and corporate adventurism.  Apparently, we've been bludgeoned under the radar.....or maybe we were too frightened to allow ourselves to see.  Now, before we once again exercise our one chance to make real changes in a democracy, we'd better open our eyes and our minds.
0307387178|4.0|Very good read - have your kids read it too.  There's one thing to be adventurous in life, there's another to be prepared.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|Seems like every time I turned on the radio, I heard another Paramore song that I couldn't stop singing so the album was a good deal.
B00027JZ3E|4.0|What is this? A Vampire movie staring teenagers from the 80's, featuring the two Coreys.....and it's good? Yes! This film had everything going against it and yet it went over well and has become a cult classic. I always liked this film, but it seems to have aged well with the exception of some generic 80's music and styles. The cast is very good and the tension and comedic overtones are well balanced in this new age vampire yarn. One of the best from the 80's horror archives. The 2 disc DVD edition has a nice DVD transfer and an excellent amount of extras for a film like this.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|This story was presented so briefly that anybody having not read the book a number of times would be totally lost.  There is not enough of the book in it to even give clues to events portrayed!  Relationships are not portrayed as in the book...everybody gets a long far too well. Casting seemed to be well enough, but the story line lacked enough depth to convey the plot along.  I was so looking forward to this, especially after watching Sense & Sensibility, which was superbly done!
B0011KQSZ4|3.0|Typical british humour taking the mickey out of the moment, BUT considering all the hype about how funny this film was supposed to be you will be highly disappointed, watchable alot of the funny scenes are predictable or not even funny - delivery of the wrong body/coffin, the accidently taking the drugs and having the side effects, finding your father was secretly having an affair with another man who happens to be a dwarf. Again watchable but not very funny and certainly not in the class of Four Weddings and a funeral or Bridget Jones Diary.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|enough can't be said about how awesome this show really is.  i have watched both seasons probably a good four or five times.  i never mind watching it over either as i keep introducing my family and friends to it too - and they love it just as much!!
B000O75F7C|5.0|The music is incredible and the lyrics are phenomenal. This album is one of my favorite albums of all time.
6305090564|4.0|It's hard to put this movie down, as it tries so hard to pay homage to the sci-fi and horror movies from the past. This film borrorws from several other movies like 'Alien' and 'Poseidon Adventure', but it is one heck of a ride. The action is tense, Rob Botton's(The Thing remake)FX are very good and just the right amount of tongue and cheek humor thrown in to make this a very good monster movie, that's right up there with the original 'Tremors'.....not quite. The DVD transfer looks good, but this film deserves an upgrade with some interesting extra material.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|i loved this movie i saw this with my brother 2 weeks before he died so it is special to me everytime i watched it  i remember the time i spent with my brother and when i do see bees flying around i look at them in a different way
B0011NVC98|2.0|Animation was excellent, the story and the storyline was boring and uninteresting and caused me to loss interest very quickly.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Perhaps appropriately, the score's been viscously slashed.  However, you don't feel the loss of all that great music because the acting and filmmaking are so effective.  (As oppossed to Dreamgirls where the loss of songs is keenly felt with the great singing talent on board.)  Here I'm not sure if there are any songs that really cry out to be put back in.  And the \\"book\\" scenes here are better than those in the original show.  There are real thrills.<br /><br />Depp may be channeling Bowie when he sings, but he's spectacular.  Carter looks great and is very good in the role if her singing is a little wan.  I'm not a big Tim Burton fan, but here he brings a style that's not too mannered and doesn't distract from the power of the piece.  And unlike the directors of Chicago or Rent, he's refreshingly unapologetic about the actor's breaking into song.  This is easily his best film.<br /><br />The second disc has very interesting, academic looks at the Grand Guignol style and the original character.  I just wish the doc on the original stage show were longer, more along the lines of the one on the Phantom DVD.
6300273199|5.0|\\"Back in Black\\" not withstanding, AC/DC have never even come close to equaling what they produced when Bon Scott was alive. And from their beginning to the final Scott album, the classic \\"Highway to Hell\\", they just seemed to get better and better! And here we have an entire concert from that tour, filmed in Paris, which shows them at their absolute peak and includes backstage and interview documentary footage!<br /><br />And, on top of all that, it's quite simply one of the GREATEST Rock and Roll concert films ever made...so WHERE'S THE DVD?!?!? I thought this would be one of the first things they released when DVDs became mainstream, after all, it didn't take long for it to appear on stereo hi-fi VHS in the mid-1980s and I even saw it for rent several times. But to this day, the VHS is all we have!! And that simple fact is one of the great mysteries of the modern media rock era!<br /><br />I captured and burned this on a DVD-R myself but, as anyone who has ever done that knows, it's a little grainy and stereo is the only audio option so the lack of a re-mastered professional release with 5.1 or 6.1 sound is nothing short of unacceptable! (At least I was able to re-mix it while capturing it so it sounds a little better). And, sorry, \\"Family Jewels\\" comes close but, if you're happy with that, you've never seen \\"Let There Be Rock\\"!!<br /><br />The song list is below and, yes, each song is featured in its entirety, this isn't one of those pieces of garbage that only show snippets of songs before going back to the documentary footage.<br /><br />Bottom line: DVD or no DVD, if you like Rock and still own a VCR there is NO EXCUSE for not already owning this tape. Especially since good used copies are widely available for under $10 including shipping!<br /><br />Live Wire<br />Shot Down In Flames<br />Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be<br />Sin City<br />Bad Boy Boogie<br />The Jack<br />Highway to Hell<br />Girl's Got Rhythm<br />High Voltage<br />Whole Lotta Rosie<br />Rocker<br />Let There Be Rock
B00154GEFU|4.0|It is SO hard to turn back the clock and pick up the pieces, to take up the mantle and relive those glory years but Asia, hot from a year and a half successful reunion tour, have managed to beat the odds and have released an accomplished record. Having the original quartet (Wetton, Downes, Howe and Palmer) in the same room again was the first miracle. The next was releasing this worthwhile record. Howe and Palmer have more than kept up their chops over the years with Yes and ELP reunions plus various side projects. But the real treat, as always with Asia, is the songwriting of Wetton and Downes. For really, Asia is a balance of two great songwriters and two virtuoso musicians. Highlights: \\"Never Again\\", \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" (which the band currently showcases live), \\"Nothing's Forever\\", \\"Sleeping Giants\\", \\"Parallel Worlds\\" and \\"Wish I'd Known All Along.\\" This is a good mix of progressive music and pop melody. There are few, if any, weak tracks. And while, some tunes may be very similiar to the recent Wetton/Downes Icon projects (also highly recommended) and others are definitely a throwback to the sound of the 80's, these songs are informed with heart and vision worthy of the band's phenomal first record. I have read some fans' reviews who wish to dredge up comparisons to the Payne years, or the Asia as Downes solo period. For me, the magic of Asia has always been THIS quartet and starting with Astra, the magic began to wane quickly. In fact, Payne and the other ex-Asia members now call themselves Asia featuring John Payne! (When the original quartet of KISS reapplied the makeup, Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer did not form a band called KISS featuring Bruce and Eric--they knew better!) I love it! Warring over that almighty dollar that only the magic of the Asia name brings. (It's almost like a schism in a major religion...or worse, the great divide of Trekdom with the Old and New Generations!). Well, with Asia, what is old is NEW AGAIN! The Phoenix rises! This is the quartet that brought it to life in this first place!
0374280967|5.0|What would happen if Elizabeth II, Queen of England and matriarch of a family notoriously hostile to books, suddenly became an avid reader? Alan Bennett gives us the wryly hilarious answer in his novella, \\"The Uncommon Reader.\\" Bennett is well known for his erudition and wit as an essayist and playwright, and also--as demonstrated before in \\"The Madness of King George\\"--his tart and piercing insight into the institution of royalty and what it does to those who are part of it. How Bennett, a Yorkshireman of lower-middle-class origins, came by his insights into the House of Windsor is a mystery, but it has given us some delightful works of literature, including \\"The Uncommon Reader.\\" Bennett is brisk and persuasive in portraying how a steady course of reading presents the Queen with a series of revelations about her life and personality, and how it shapes her perceptions of her empire and her people. Simultaneously, reading interferes terribly with the serene dispatch of royal duties (the corgis are just as unhappy as the equerries). In this little book of barely more than a hundred pages, Bennett has a great deal of fun skewering not only royalty and its minions, but also his fellow authors. Here are the Queen's thoughts after hosting a soiree for some of Britain's most distinguished literary lights: \\"Authors, she soon decided, were probably best met in the pages of their novels, and as much creatures of the reader's imagination as the characters in their books. Nor did they seem to think one had done them a kindness by reading their writings. Rather they had done one the kindness by writing them.\\"
B0013FFMOK|4.0|I thought that it was a very good movie, reminded me of an old movie called \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" made back in the 60's or 70's. Same movie but a little different ending.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I'm usually not a huge musical fan so I was a little skeptical when I went to see this movie.  However I was truly surprised by what I saw.  I think thre reason I did like it so much is mainly because it kind of goes against every other musical out there.  First off the singing isn't great.  I'm not saying it's bad, but the movie doesn't really rely on it's singing to advance the plot.  It relies more on the images and reactions that are visually seen on the screen.  Second, this sort of subject matter hasn't really been dealt with in a musical before. (At least not one that I've seen)  And last, the ending is far from a feel-good ending.  Sure there are other movies that have tragic endings but at least in those the characters learn a valuable lesson.  At the end of this film none of the characters are better off than when they started, if anything they are all scarred, some mentally and some physically from the actions that others see and take.  In all Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual.  He is by far one of the best actors in the business, and Helena Bonham Carter is right up there with him every step of the way.  The direction is great, and some of the dark, setting adds a lot to the film.  It's definately worth seeing for those that normally don't like the musicals.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is hands down the best version made to date. Colin Firth is fantastic as the arrogant and aloof Mr. Darcy. Jennifer Ehle is great at playing the smart and whitty Elizabeth Bennet. This version is somewhat long, but it just makes you hungry for more. I love Jane Austen's work, the classic romance story lines are great and I never get tired of watching Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensiblity.
B0016LTNL4|5.0|This is English humor as only the English have mastered. You knew at times just what was going to happen and still they made you laugh. Great cast and a nice way to watch a movie. No negatives.
B000059QYB|5.0|Despite posing like a bad boy (whether he is or was really one, we don't know for sure), Billy Idol is a good singer and always had good intentions. His collection of tunes is one of the landmarks of the 80s, when music used to be more interesting in general than it is nowadays (with some exceptions, of course).<br /><br />This 2001 compilation of \\"Greatest Hits\\" reunites not necessarily his best, but at least his best known songs. Classics such as \\"Mony Mony\\", \\"Rebel Yell\\" and \\"Cradle of Rock\\", as well as the ballads \\"Flash for Fantasy\\", \\"Eyes Without a Face\\" and \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" are here with 10 other tracks, including a nice Simple Minds cover of \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\", another classic of that decade.<br /><br />All tracks are 24-bit digitally remastered for the very delight of every Pop Rock fan of the 80s.
B000R9J3X4|5.0|I adore this band and Shirley Manson rules. This disc has all the greatest hits and it's the one to choose if you are a fan of Garbage.
B00016POFE|5.0|If you like PT, you'll love this DVD-A.  It has a few extra tracks for the Futile album which are just amazing.  The tracks sound great but there is a small \\"problem\\" for me.  The stereo track is only in 16-bit, whereas the rest of the PT DVDs have the music in 24-bit stereo.  Now, the chances are that if you are buying this album, you are buying it for the 24-bit Surround, so you probably don't care.  In fact, that is why I bought it.  But I still don't see why it couldn't have been done in 24-bit stereo.
B000000ISO|5.0|I remember buying this album(literaly) the first day it came out back in 1986. At first my feelings were so-so for it because I was expecting it to be a rocker like the first two albums. In time however, this album grew on me and it is on my top 25 list of my favorite albums of all time. I saw Boston live in concert in 1987 at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas Tx in front of a crowd of 70,000 people.  Boston was actually the headliner and it was in support of this album that Boston was touring and drawing large audiences. Every song in the album is good, except \\"To Be A Man\\" just didn't do it for me. The stand out tracks are \\"Amanda\\", \\"We're Ready\\", \\"Cool The Engines\\", \\"My Destination\\", and \\"Can'tcha Say/Still In Love\\", and \\"Hollyann\\". If you like Boston, this album is highly recomended.  Pay no attention at the reviewers that keep saying that this album falls short in comparison to the first two. It's just that it is a bit different that's all.  I mean you still get Boston's traditional guitar sounds and studio gadgets plus Brad Delps(RIP) sweet vocals and harmonies.  By the way the current cd needs to be re-mastered. The sound output is very low in comparison to the re-mastered \\"Boston\\", and \\"Don't Look Back\\" and also the sound could be \\"clean up\\" a little bit.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|The perfection of each number makes Born to Run an extraordinary release that defines time. And this unique CD and 2-DVD is an essential exploration of the power and musical genius of Bruce Springsteen.<br /><br />The Hammersmith Odeon - November 1975 - concert DVD is worth the price of admission, as larger-than-life myths have surrounded this first gig outside the U.S. Though truth can be stranger than fiction - Springsteen has joked for years about the bored-looking British media occupying the first couple of rows - the band delivered an astonishing show in a historical venue in a rare display of a group living up to the hype from a record company's PR onslaught.<br /><br />The DVD on the making of the album is highly informative and avoids the trappings of simply being a saccharine sketch muddled by egos; it is a lesson on how such features should be produced.<br /><br />While many boxed sets supplement the original release - and are seemingly packaged for collectors - this is as perfect place to start for new fans as it is for those looking to bolster their CD/DVD library of Springsteen/E Street Band material.

My mother in law opens our wanna be 1920's farm house mail box and pulls a yellow package from within. My wife's eyes read my name across the front and then those words pierced from her lips, \\"MARC ***** YOU BETTER NOT HAVE BOUGHTEN ANYTHING FROM AMAZON, WE JUST INVESTED 14 THOUSAND DOLLARS IN AN HVAC SYSTEM FOR OUR HOUSE!!!!\\" My puzzled look said it all. Then I said those famous words, \\"I don't know what this is.\\" Ah, but that's when I noticed the precision of the handwriting. It was detail oriented, precise, and clearly legible. I only know one person with that handwriting!!!<br /><br />  I opened the package and a letter was attached to this CD.<br /><br />(BRER MARC,<br />  A Pretty \\"Bluesy\\" album, and probably one of my top 10 or top 12 from any genre.

Nope, not a bad one in the bunch!!! San Diego Serenade helped put my mind at peace and relax my exhausted body.  My other favorites are: New Coat Of Pain, The Heart Of Saturday Night, and Drunk On The Moon. This is a can't miss collection of songs for any blues fan, and was worth the near death experience I almost received in the process. Having only listened to it for the first time I can guarantee any potential new listener that you have been missing out on a quality album if you haven't listened to this. This CD/Album should be viewed as a blues classic PERIOD!!! If you don't own this quickly run out and purchase it. I might even want this CD played in my memory at my funeral.

1577314808|4.0|I was able to recognize many of the concepts Tolle expounded in 'Power of Now' as ideas flying around in my head, but hadn't settled upon.  His insight was helpful.
B000ZN802W|5.0|My husband has read several books by Jon Krakauer, including the one this was based on, and I have great admiration for Sean Penn, so this was an enjoyable movie for us.  My husband felt the screenplay was very true to the book.  For anyone who has ever become disillusioned with society at any time in their life, for whatever reason, and considers heading out to find real meaning in the wilderness, this movie rings true. But it also shows that even with luck and decent skills, at some point, nature can teach harsh lessons.  The scenery is gorgeous, and the actors' performances excellent.  It doesn't answer any questions; rather, it presents the story and leaves the interpretations for you to think through.  A keeper.
B000VDDDY6|3.0|I was underwhelmed, disks 1-2 had a very bad recording for the Openning theme, it sounds like Shatner is in a tunnel and the music is so loud that Shatner can barely be heard.<br />As for the rest of the series - it's great. I'm a long time ST fan and seeing this as bright as it is was a lot of fun. The quality is almost too good in that you can see ever detail (Good or bad). I won't bother to recap all the episodes I'm sure a few others have done that. Overall - for the sale price it is worth the money.
B00004R9A4|5.0|I have'nt seen this movie in 15 years or so and I wanted to get it to share with my 3 year old little boy. The price was fantastic, the movie came in excelent condition and shipping was very quick. I would buy from this vendor again. This movie is for the young and old!
6305014140|3.0|I can't count myself among those who gush over this tale of a wandering samurai and two companions who take on an evil foe and his demonic minions.  The animation is good but not outstanding.  The story had me riveted early on as the characters were introduced and their dilemma revealed, but the narrative became quite murky and by the time the climactic shipboard battle occurred, I had lost interest.  The demons in this film are quite imaginative.
B0012OQZWA|5.0|Imagine all those brilliant moments from the various Cannible Corpse albums condensed into a single piece of work. I'm here to say the title song alone is worth the price of admission folks. As a dutifull consumer of all things metal, I must say that this is absolutely top shelf. My jaw was literally dropped for 4 minutes straight at one point. It felt like the first time I heard Ride The Lightning. I saw these guys live opening for Nile (or Opeth?) a few years back and they definitely stole the show. And they have exponentially improved since then. I really have no use for dozens of other cd's that I previously used for this kind of fix. I'll hold onto (Death's) Human, Once Upon the Cross, and Serpents of the Light, but not much else. P.S. the Dethalbum rules.
6305433909|5.0|i have to say in my opinion the second movie is better then the first.  not as much drama with the mob like the first just a bunch of inner city kids looking for an inspiration.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This movie came without a hard case. Some customers may be put off by that but since my collection has grown so big I got tired of trying to look for a movie and so many went unwatched just b/c they were hard to get to. I file mine in a DVD case and throw the movie case away. It makes it so easy to find the perfect movie. The shipping was fast, only being 3 or 4 business days and the movie was in a protective sleeve scratch free. I would order from this vendor again. Oh, and great movie too! lol
1400063515|1.0|The book starts well with challenging the readers to be skeptics about most everything. One should try to turn the pyramid upside down - the anti library, etc.  The author does correctly point out that power laws dominate several aspects of our life where we assume things to be normally distributed - stock market, etc.  It is also somewhat correct that we try to find causalities where we are not capable and thus draw incorrect reasonings.  But in reality the book should be no more than 25% of its original size. The basic idea is that predictions are not always correct. Labor makes little difference while luck is the real reason behind major successes - inventions, discoveries, serendipity.    Other than that, the author comes across as a real jerk - pompous, arrogant and foolish at times. His analogies do not hold correctly. One should not read newspapers because a newspapers are full of crap. Then he talks about rats under radiation and prisoners in Siberia and how they are similar. Rats are tortured physically and are thus weaker, prisoners are mentally traumatized and thus can get more dangerous. This is a well known established fact.    According to the author, we should be prepared for all the unknown - i.e. infinite number of situations and not for the known situations. He also warns how theories laden with stories and unnecessary scientific evidence and this is exactly what the author is doing though out the book. There are unrelated anecdotes like random thoughts through out the book.   It seems that he and a limited close circle are the smartest people who have ever walked the earth, while the rest have no idea what is going on.  Also information seems to have little or no value. Clearly he knows nothing about 'Kelly's Criteria'  The author continually criticizes 'quants' financial engineers since are supposedly so full of it. And what was he on the wall street?  I can go on about inconsistencies in the book. Please spare yourselves and if you really want,read one of the two books    Fooled by Randomness   Fortune's Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street

B000V8I2QU|5.0|I can't pretend that I'm old enough to tell you that I remember listening to Born the U.S.A. in high school, but I am a big fan of Bruce and very familiar with his music.  In my view, Magic is without a doubt his best since Born in the U.S.A.  There's not one song on the album that is sub-par, and it maintains that unique E Street sound that has been lacking in some of Bruce's more recent albums.    The opening track, \\"Radio Nowhere\\", is probably the most widely played on the album and with good reason....it's a great, up-tempo song.  But Radio Nowhere is only the beginning in an album full of gems.    Here are a few of my favorites:    \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" is a good, confident, mid-tempo song with a great combo of sax and guitar.       \\"Living in the Future\\" is another, excellent, up-tempo song with a great tune and message.  This is the addicting one that you'll be singing to yourself all day.     \\"You Own Worst Enemy\\" is another addicting, slower-tempo track that you can really identify with on a bad day.    The title track, \\"Magic\\", is very reminiscent of \\"The Rising\\", although I actually prefer it because it is much less repetitive and very relaxing.    \\"Last to Die\\" is the most openly political track on the album, drawing on John Kerry's famous quote after returning to the United States after serving in Vietnam.  Of course, this time Springsteen is obviously taking aim at that mess we have going on in Iraq.  It's a great song, and more power to him for getting an important message out there.    Hailed by many as the best track on the album, \\"Long Walk Home\\" is an excellent song that reminds me very much of Thunder Road.  It has that laid back beginning that gets more and more up-tempo, fun and just plain awesome all the way through.    All things considered, this is an absolutely excellent album.  Bruce is still putting quality stuff out there and I think this is really the best in a long time.  Highly recommended!
B000I2MRHE|5.0|I like this product.  My daughter is just starting to use it, because she was still a little too small when I purchased it. The mirror wasn't properly attached, so I had to sew down the velcro bottom the mirror attached to.  Other than that I've had no problems and I love the bright colors.  It is very sturdy and easy to clean.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|This film is about the problem of socialism and the impact that it has on the human condition. Although the film starts off in the direction of a drama involving communist surveillance of a screenwriter to combat the power of art in the form of suggestive revolution, it quickly becomes a damning investigation into the biological implications of big brother. The actors are sure to move onto bigger things and so is the director although the depressing nature of its themes may be a bit much for some. Still this is as good as it gets since Orwell wrote 1984. It is hard to shake off the impact, but maybe the hype might not meet expectations. Worth seeing if you can put yourself through it.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Well folks, now that the dust has settled from the Sony vs. Immersion lawsuit, Playstation 3 owners are finally able to feel the vibe again!    I purchased this controller today and I knew the only way to properly road-test it was on the game that made the Dualshock famous, [[ASIN:B00001X50M Metal Gear Solid]]. After booting up the game, I walked down the hallway and got spotted by a guard. As he shouted, \\"WHO'S THAT?\\" the controller jumped in my hand - and I knew this was a smart purchase. As the guards shot at me, I felt the feedback of the bullets, just as I had 10 years ago on my Sony Playstation.    I picked out another old school Playstation game, [[ASIN:B00000I1BG Tenchu: Stealth Assassins]]. From Ayame's blades to Rikimaru's sword, each sword swipe and jump had excellent feedback.    Okay, so my Playstation games worked out. But what about my Playstation 2 library?    I popped in [[ASIN:B0002XL3BA God of War]], knowing I had to feel the swing of the Blades of Chaos. The controller vibrations felt a little lighter here, but the vibrations still occurred at the appropriate times.    Then I chose [[ASIN:B0007OSLAA Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction]]. Who better to test a vibration controller than the Sultan of Smash? All the power jumps and smashes had the vibrations intact, but they still felt a little on the light side.    All right, so far I was two for two with my Playstation and Playstation 2 test subjects. But what about my Playstation 3 games? Could I possibly hit a trifecta?    I put in [[ASIN:B000UW21A0 Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]] and I decided to jump right into a heated firefight. The controller gave me feedback while shooting weapons and getting hit by enemy fire, but I knew my purchase was justified when Drake was near death: I FELT THE DUALSHOCK 3 PULSING IN SYNCH WITH DRAKE'S HEARTBEAT. It's one thing to hear that noise and know he's near death, it's quite another to feel the pulse in my own hands.    Okay, so the feedback on the older gameswas there, but a little lighter than I remember. The reason? Well, when I decided to go wireless on my Playstation 2 system, I bought a Logitec Dualshock controller. It turns out, that controller takes two \\"AA\\" batteries, and the vibration motors inside the controller handles are slightly larger than the ones in the Dualshock 3. That's where I felt the difference.    The Dualshock 3 vibrations may be slightly less than the Logitec controller, but it doesn't require the purchase of batteries.   The Dualshock 3 may be slightly heavier than the SixAxis, but it doesn't take up any extra space at all.    Sure, the price is about $15 more than the SixAxis, but it's a worthy upgrade for the Playstation 3 gamer who kicks it old school as well as new school. The only other drawback is the lack of an additional USB cable - but we can use the one that came with the system itself.    So what's the final verdict?    Order it, plug it in, charge it up, and get ready for the inevitable downloads from the Playstation Store to make the older PS3 games Dualshock 3 compatible.     I wouldn't recommend a feedback peripheral without providing my own feedback...    Enjoy!
B000XTLUW0|4.0|With its last 2 studio albums (\\"Absolution\\" and \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\"), Muse achieved massive cross-over from a band on the fringe of indie/prog/rock to full blown commercial mainstream appeal. Muse also is one of the most energetic live acts around, and so it is only natural that a live album would be forthcoming at some point. This release, however, does one better: \\"HAAR: Live at Wembley Stadium, London, 17 June 2007\\" is indeed a CD/DVD combo.<br /><br />As to the CD (14 tracks; 72 min.), it is essentially a greatest hits live of the band. All the highlights of the Absolution album and the Black Holes album are here, including Stockholm Syndrome, Suppermassive Black Hole, Hysteria, etc. etc., and a few choice tracks from the early days are included as well. The sound is crisp, and the band is in great form throughout.<br /><br />As to the DVD (20 tracks, 100 min.), it brings the show in its entirety (which the CD could not do, due to space limitations) and in all of its visual glory. I am very happy to tell you that the DVD is actually watchable, and even more: it is enjoyable. Regretfully, many concert DVDs these days are edited so ridiculously that they induce headaches most of the time. Check out last year's REM Live release as a prime example of that. Beware that there are no extras on the DVD: it's the concert, and that's it.<br /><br />In all \\"HAARP\\" is an excellent recap of what Muse has accomplished to date and where they are today. I've had an opportunity to see the band in concert here in the US a number of times in the 2004-07 period, and while it cannot compare of course to the grandeur of Wembley Stadium, they never failed to give their everything, no matter how small or how large the crowd. I can't wait to see where Muse goes from here.

B000ULPFGS|3.0|I saw this at the movies and loved it, so I gladly bought it on disc, but when I re watched it I found myself getting bored, the movie seemed to drag on and on.  My wife and son felt the same, all 3 of us couldn't wait for the movie to end, very strange considering we all loved it on the big screen.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out in late 1998, and it was one of those discs that immediately made me shake my head in disbelief at how good it was. Nearly ten years later, it still blows me away every time I listen to it. There are no filler tracks here; I listen to it from start to finish every single time. Tracks like \\"Joining You\\" and \\"Can't Not\\" recall the sound of Jagged Little Pill, but there's also a level of maturity not present on that first disc. The songwriting and lyrics are excellent, and Morissette's vocals are heartfelt and sincere. Ask me to name the five CD's   I'd take with me to a deserted island and this might be the first one I name.
0446677450|4.0|This enlightening book talks about the differences between rich and middle class thinking, in terms of making money the smart way or the hard way.  The theme of this book is getting out of the rat race and learning how to create your own wealth, not dependent on Social Security or your job (Just Over Broke).  I thought the book was pretty well-written but it's mostly a what-to-do book as opposed to a how-to book.  You'll have to read the books on his recommended reading list and others on the subjects you are interested in to increase your financial literacy, a topic Mr. Kiyosaki stresses that is key.  Compared to other financial books I've read, it's theme is common - bringing in your own income, reduce your tax bill legally as much as possible, and become financially literate. I loved this book!!
B00003CXDG|3.0|This movie is a perfect example of an over blown, over the top, over budget sequel. When will Hollywood learn that bigger explosions and bigger budget doesn't make a better sequel, that's why most sequels fail to be even loyal to the first. That is exactly what happens here. Director John Woo, best known for his fascinating heroic bloodshed movies (The Killer, a better tomorrow, face/off)tries to brings his wonders to this flick. Unfortunately he fails to bring them in right to this sequel. The problem here is that it lacks the goodies of the first. The main issue is the mood; it is completely different from the first film. Whereas The first M:I had a nice blend of espionage and action, this one is an exaggerated/story less sequel. It felt more like a bad James Bond movie then it felt like a good spy movie.<br /><br />The movie's thin plot surrounds upon a man made lethal virus, deadly enough to kill someone in 48 hours. The plan is to release the virus and then make money from selling the antidote how original.. Right? The rest is Tom Cruise doing crazy stunts, and exaggerating his persona. Now the movie does have a lot of good action sequences that's for sure, and it sounds and looks nice on screen and john woo is known for that, known for making action look like poetry. But it doesn't do  justice to the movie, it only makes it exaggerating; just because the action may look cool doesn't mean it will make a movie good, you need story also, which I felt was missing here. And the story they chose was bland and soulless. The fact  is that this movie is a Tom Cruise vehicle rather than a team work espionage. It doesn't have the chemistry of the TV series nor of the first movie. Definitely rent before buying, unless you're an avid fan of the franchise.<br /><br />MY PERSONL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5
0060506989|5.0|After seeing the movie version starring Mel Gibson based on this book, I wanted to read the historical account of the battle. Lt Gen Moore and Joseph Galloway do an excellent job describing the details in sequence of the two phases of the Ia Drang battle in the Viet Nam war (the movie covers the first phase only) including both facts and personal accounts of the battle. Lt Gen Moore's introductory chapter is an excellent commentary about our entry into the war especially concerning the mindset of those who first fought in this first big American battle in Viet Nam. The book presents stories of the individuals who fought in both phases of the battle in their own words, which is a strong point of the book. Lt Gen Moore's descriptions and comments are interspersed with these personal accounts of the battle, and a number of pictures of these individuals are included.<br /><br />The last part of the book is most excellent. Here, the authors set up the second phase of the battle at LZ Albany and describe it from the viewpoint of those who were involved. The reader can anticipate the assault that follows. I also appreciate the chapter that follows up with the families of those who died in battle concerning how they have dealt with the loss of their loved one since then. It is very moving.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for people who have seen the movie version and want to read what actually happened in this battle. It is also good for students of history (this is an excellent military history) and political science (Lt. Gen. Moore's comments about our involvement in Vietnam are very insightful).
B000021YQV|4.0|This is the first SOAD ablum I ever heard and the intensity of it can blow you away (edit: I've heard intenser now...not as naieve...but it's still good). It has political rantings all over it but can also make you laugh with tracks like bounce.     1. Prison song 9/10. A great opener which explains how bad the prison system is and has the guitarist saying 'I grab my, smack my b**** right here in hollywood'. Good bass...yummy...    2. Needles 10/10. Very heavy and they appear to be singing about a tapeworm to begin with (yes...tapeworm). Then it goes calm and they sing about some tomb of some old man and then go heavy again. Powerful (edit: not really that powerful but it's pretty good).     3. Deer Dance 9/10. The verses are very melodic political rantings, which is odd because the choruses are thrash metal heavy(edit: that is now debatable). The contrast will work for some and not for others it all depends on what you're into.     4. Jet 10/10. I like this song. The topic is stupid but is so full of energy that I'm not bothered about the horse or the shackled old man mentioned in the lyrics.     5. XY 8/10. Okay but a bit samey to the other tracks above. And we do need to multiply (edit: trigonometry is more important of course).    6. Chop Suey 9/10. The most well known song off the album. About suicide it starts off heavy and then goes into an emotional outbreak in the chorus.     7. Bounce 9/10. Makes me laugh. Whoever thought there would be a song about pogo sticks? Serj also makes random croaking sounds near the end.     8. Forest 10/10. Sounds powerful and intense the entire time and the chorus is pretty (edit: rather) good too.     9. ATWA 8/10. Starts off calm and gets loud in the chorus. Okay I guess.     10. Science 7/10. This song does feel a bit samey to the other tracks. Fast and constant.     11. Shimmy 9/10. The guitars are heavy and Serj talks very fast. Nothing new BUT the chorus works very well with the song.     12. Toxicity 9/10. The first SOADsong I ever heard and this will always sound great(edit: I was mistaken it is wearing kind of thin). Serj sings/screams his heart out.     13. Psycho 8/10. Sounds drug influenced, and I swear I can hear children singing in the background...     14. Aerials 9/10. A nice melodic end and is one of the best songs. Perfect ending. (edit:...you know what I'm going to say)    If you like metal you won't be disapointed (edit:..um...no). If you like music you should still buy this for the melodic parts and if you don't like music why do you read reviews?     EDIT: The debut self titled album is significantly better...if you like this sort of music you should buy that over this...
1577314808|5.0|This book is, by far, the most inspirational piece of literature I've ever come across. I can quite honestly and literally say, that this book has changed my life. I large part is due to the fact that this book focuses on inner peace and enlightenment from an \\"Everyday Life\\" point of view.<br /><br />I spent my life a worrier and angry at the world, but never really realized it. I was miserable and even in my teens, I was always stressed and would go through periods of depression. After a while I began to think that there had to be something else. Obviously, things and people, were not giving me the fulfillment I desired. Then I was introduced to Eckhart Tolle's teachings and I purchased this book.<br /><br />Immediately after I began to read \\"The Power of Now\\", I became aware of those negative feelings and energy within me. Instantly they vanished and I remember the moment it happened. I was standing in my parking lot, by myself, and just began to laugh out loud. It was the most freeing and peaceful feeling I have EVER fealt. The peace continues, with focus, and determination to not fall into the old mind based patterns. I still live my life, spend time with friends, and have tons of fun. However, I do it all with a new sense of inner peace.<br /><br />I will not go into the teachings of the book in this review. If you're curious, pick up a copy. They aren't very expensive on Amazon. You don't have much to lose, but everything to gain. Not everyone, however, is ready for this teaching. You must be ready for a new way to live, because many of these ideas go against habits deeply embedded in our society. If you don't feel you can accept this teaching, no worries. The simple fact that you were open enough to try to see things differently, has helped to enrich your life.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|A truly excellent comedy, in the best tradition of British farce. Based around the funeral of the family patriarch, at which all sorts of things about the dead man's past life get revealed.

0307388840|3.0|I decided to read this book because I fell in love with the movie. But the problem lies with mixing the images from the movie with the imagery created by McEwan. First and foremost, the movie closely resembles the book, so at times it was hard for me to picture the events and people without thinking of the movie. Atonement is a story about a little girl (Briony) who convinces herself of something that she knows is a lie, and this lie changes the lives of everyone around her. (I won't tell you exactly what the lie is, but you might be able to get an idea.) She grows up to become a novelist and writes Atonement as her way to absolve herself of the lie that ruins her sister's, Cecilia and Robbie (the housekeeper's son) relationship.  The story is told from many different points of view, which takes readers to the state of mind of the characters. Surprisingly, you come to understand that everyone has a little made up story in their mind. Robbie is convinved that Briony told that lie because she was in love with him. Briony tells the lie because she made up the story that Robbie is a sex maniac and wanted to protect her sister. In a sense, she wanted the lie to be true for her own vindication. The thing that moves me about this book is the kind of love that Cecilia and Robbie had for each other, their longing to be with one another, and never even having that single wish fulfilled. It was absolutely heartbreaking to think of a life that you can share with someone, look forward to it, and never have it realized. Although Briony was absolutely wrong about what she did, you realize, that there is this human side to her and it's hard to hate her because you, as a reader, also get to see what went on in her mind when she lied.

B000024NOC|5.0|What an album this is!  \\"Who's Next\\" is The Who at the peak of their creativity.  And one wonders what their creation would have been like had Pete Townshend ended up making his \\"Lifehouse\\" concept come into being.  This CD has two essays in the liner notes--one by Townshend and the other by John Atkins, as they discuss the ambitious concept that would move far beyond their rock opera \\"Tommy.\\" There were four recording sessions, according to the notes. When \\"Lifehouse\\" fell apart, bits and pieces were pulled together for \\"Who's Next.\\"  And, in this CD, four songs from the original \\"Lifehouse\\" project not in the original album are included here.  Thus, there is an interesting historical aspect of this version of \\"Who's Next.\\" That explains why this version has 16 cuts, more than the original recording.<br /><br />Another singularity to this work is its use of electronic music (synthesizers), which had not been much apparent in rock and roll until that time.<br /><br />A sampling of some of the songs.<br /><br />\\"Baba O'Riley\\": One of the best Who songs--and one of the best in the annals of rock and roll. The sound is very different from that of The Who compared with just a few years earlier, featuring both keyboards and synthesizer. Of course, at the center of it all is The Who sound--Keith Moon on drums, John Entwistle on bass, Roger Daltrey's vocals, and Pete Townshend's guitar (as well as synthesizer, keyboard work, and sometimes vocals). On this cut, David Arbus contributes another twist with his violin work.  One key line:<br /><br />\\"Don't cry, don't raise your eye,<br />It's only teenage wasteland.\\"<br /><br />In fact, when I was younger, I thought the name of this song was \\"Teenage Wasteland\\"!<br /><br />\\"Going Mobile.\\" I love this song!  It gets off to a lively start, with Moon's drumming anchoring the band.<br /><br />\\"Going mobile, keep me moving.\\"<br /><br />Nice synthesizer effects, too.<br /><br />\\"The Song Is Over\\": This starts off with some nice piano work by Nicky Hopkins and some cool guitar work by Townshend.  Daltrey sings lines such as:<br /><br />\\"The song is over.<br />It's all over.<br />I should have known it,<br />She tried to find me.<br />Our love is over.\\"<br /><br />A wonderful six minutes plus song.<br /><br />What about \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\"? Another terrific song.<br /><br />\\"I tip my hat to the new revolution.<br />. . .<br />Pick up my guitar and play<br />. . .<br />Then I get on my knees to pray<br />We don't get fooled again.\\"<br /><br />Political commentary wed to steaming rock and roll.  A hard combination to beat!<br /><br />The song closes out with a primal wail from Daltrey and the final, climactic lines that speak to the disappointment with leaders who try to fool us:<br /><br />\\"Meet the new boss,<br />Same as the old boss.\\"<br /><br />The original songs make this special, of course.  The addition of several songs from the \\"Lifehouse\\" project makes this even more intriguing. Well worth 5 stars.s lines such as:    \\"The song is over.  It's all over.  I should have known it,  She tried to find me.  Our love is over.\\"    A wonderful six minutes plus song.    What about \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\"? Another terrific song.    \\"I tip my hat to the new revolution.  . . .   Pick up my guitar and play  . . .

B000000W5F|5.0|The Rolling Stones had a string of stunning albums, up to \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" Then, after a number of albums that had some strengths and some weaknesses, \\"Some Girls,\\" one of their best came out.  Then a disappointing \\"Emotional Rescue.\\" But the Stones bounced back with a pretty good work, \\"Tattoo You.\\"  Many of the albums after \\"Exile\\" would have a few great songs--but also a number that did not measure up (and some were little more than filler). There is very little filler on \\"Tattoo You.\\"<br /><br />The CD starts out, fittingly enough, with \\"Start Me Up,\\" an absolutely classic Stones' rocker. The guitar riff is top notch, reminiscent of the best of the group's songs.<br /><br />\\"You start me up<br />. . .<br />You make a grown man cry.\\"<br /><br />A real rocker.  The band is in fine form here; this song has even been used (ugh) to signal the start of sporting events over the past decade or so.<br /><br />\\"Hang Fire.\\" Just 2 minutes and 20 seconds, but what is packed into that brief time frame!  The guitars growl nicely and the steady drumming of Charlie Watts provides a firm foundation for this song.<br /><br />\\"Black Limousine\\": Starts with some nice harmonica.  This is one of the Stones'' home grown blues songs, a genre at which they have done well (recall the wonderful little classic, \\"Down in the Hole\\").<br /><br />\\"We used to ride baby,<br />Ride around in a limousine.<br />You looked so fine, baby,<br />You in white and me in red.\\"<br /><br />Sinuous guitar work is displayed and the Stones' rhythm section lives up to its reputation.<br /><br />\\"Waiting on a Friend\\": A softer sound, and effectively done! This is more intimate and contemplative than other pieces on this album. Nice piano work at the outset.<br /><br />\\"I'm just standing in a doorway,<br />I'm just trying to make some sense.<br />. . .<br />I'm not waiting on a lady,<br />I'm waiting on a friend.\\"<br /><br />This represents an interesting change of pace.<br /><br />And these aren't the only songs of interest.  As earlier noted, there is not much filler here.  Other strong works: \\"Slave,\\" \\"Neighbours,\\" \\"No Use in Cryin',\\" and so on. Keith's obligatory song on this album is one of his better efforts.<br /><br />Rolling Stones' fans will appreciate this CD greatly.

B0000VD04M|5.0|Anyone who considers himself/herself to be a creator of any kind - inventor, musician, artist, writer - will consider this movie to be their worst professional nightmare. Imagine yourself dedicated to your craft, day after day and year after year putting out what you consider to be your best work in a field that you love only to find, at the end of your life, that you have failed in every way measurable and imaginable. This is essentially the story of director Edward D. Wood, Jr. 1924-1978, who was voted the worst director in the history of film in 1980, and as a result saw a renewed interest in his films that persists even today.<br /><br />Johnny Depp gives a great performance as Ed Wood as he was in the 1950's, starting with his friendship with Bela Lugosi and ending with the premiere of his best remembered film \\"Plan Nine from Outer Space\\" and his elopement with Kathy, who remained his wife for twenty years until his death. At this point in his life Ed's enthusiasm for his work is irrepressible. Fortunately the film ends before he descends into frustration, alcoholism, and a series of skin flicks in the 60's. The genuine friendship between Lugosi (Martin Landau) and Wood is one of the more touching parts of the film. The men settle into almost a father/son relationship with a real mutual professional admiration. Lugosi supplies Ed with a star with which he can attract investors in his films, and Wood supplies Lugosi with work and a reason to go on living. Landau's portrayal of Lugosi is phenomenal. At times you forget that you really are not watching Lugosi himself.<br /><br />The extra features on this tenth anniversary edition are really pretty good.

Which would mean something? Well, I can't speak for everyone, but this book was one of those books for me.     In the simplest of ways, it described every complex feeling I'd ever had, but couldn't put into words myself. Both tragic and comical, it struck me as the only real thing I'd ever read.     Through a introvert, shy teenager named Charlie, this book reaches into complex emotions with stunning simplicity, reaching the deepest corners of even the most average teenager's mind. Highly recommended, even if you're skeptical at first.    Other recommendations: The Catcher in the Rye, Thirteen Reasons Why, Girl Interrupted.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins is a business professor and author of three previous business books.  Good to Great seeks to answer the questions, \\"Is it possible for a good company with an ingrained culture of average performance to become truly great?\\" and, if so, \\"how?\\"<br /><br />Indeed, Collins argues, the answer is \\"yes,\\" (hence the name oft the book) and then provides seven characteristics of companies that make such a transition.  After engaging in a thorough analysis of several years worth of Fortune 500 companies (the research is explained in the first chapter and several indices), Collins identified a handful of companies that made such a leap (in markets average or difficult markets) and contrasted them with nearly identical companies that remained average.<br /><br />Collins argues that good-to-great companies begin with disciplined people--putting a highly self-differentiated person as the CEO (or its equivalent), and then hiring other self-differentiated people/firing weak or aggressive people/placing strong employees in places with the most growth potential.  Good-to-great companies also practiced disciplined thought in that they came to terms with difficult facts while maintaining optimism and followed a business plan with a limited focus.  Finally, these companies displayed disciplined action in that they were self-disciplined (no bureaucratic policies or carrot-and-stick policies were needed to force productivity), and used technology wisely to keep within their narrow focus (not adopting technology for technology's sake or allowing its siren song to change the narrow business plan).  Finally, Collins argues that success was difficult for these good-to-great companies to come by at first, but then mild successes yielded moderate successes; moderate successes yielded good successes; good successes yielded wild success to the point that the organization seemed to be on autopilot.<br /><br />I found Collin's arguments compelling and I enjoyed his writing style.  He presented concepts in memorable ways and presented stories to illustrate his points.  I also appreciated his constant continual comparison of specific good-to-great companies with always-good companies (and even declining companies).  It should be noted that this reader is not a businessman and some of the jargon was lost on me, but nevertheless the use of jargon didn't prevent me from understanding his main points.<br /><br />It should also be noted that Collins has written a follow-up monograph for those in not-for-profit organizations.

B001152TL6|4.0|So David Lynch explores here some of the themes of jealousy, desire and the masking of reality we tend to do when we are unable to see the truth. The plot is only partly important, and like any Lynch film, it is impossible to spoil it by revealing events. It simply has to be experienced. If you're a fan of Lynch, you'll love this film. It's very likely you've already seen it, in fact.  It isn't his best, however: There are some cameos that are too conspicuous and dated.  All in all, it was a good segue to [[ASIN:B0013U7G3K Mulholland Drive]] and [[ASIN:B000QQFKYE Inland Empire]].
B00005O3VC|4.0|The first ten minutes or so of this movie are hilarious.  What follows is then a hit or miss attempt to sustain the comic element first demonstrated.  The scene at the wedding and the stupid romantic son hits the mark, as does the scene at the French castle, but the other scenes at the convent and the modern historian seem to fall a bit short.    Overall, though, this is perhaps the Python troupe's best effort.  The writing is fresh and lives up to what Monty Python was doing on television (to a degree), and the end result is something you will want to watch again and again, but put a few months in between viewings.

B000002AVF|5.0|After Music Box was released a couple years earlier, it did not seem Mariah Carey could have anymore huge releases.  But despite the fact that it seemed her career peaked at that point, she topped herself again, with this, one of her best albums.    1. Fantasy- A fabulous uptempo track that is easy to escape in.  A      2. Underneath The Stars- A beautiful love song that is simple, yet sweet.  Makes you feel like a young teenager in love.  A    3. One Sweet Day- This song got played to death in its day, and while it is a nice song, and very moving, I think the overplaying has made it more skip-worthy than a lot of tracks on here.  It still gets an A-    4. Open Arms- Most of Mariah's albums have a cover song on them, and this is the one for here.  It's a nice song, and one I did not know about until I first heard it on here, so as far as I know, this is the definitive version.  A     5. Always Be My Baby- Another great song that just makes you escape in its sweet lyrics and lovely melody.  A      6. I Am Free- Not my favorite track on here, but it's nice.  It's about being single and being happy.  It's not bad, but very forgettable.  B-     7. When I Saw You- Not single material, but a very beautiful and moving love song.  B+     8. Long Ago- I'm not fond of this song, mostly because it isn't very catchy or have an interesting melody.  Not unpleasant, but forgettable.  C+    9. Melt Away- A pretty duet with Babyface, where he more or less sounds like background vocals, this is still a great song.  This is a love song for adults, especially with lyrics like \\"Everytime I see your face I go off.\\"  A-     10. Forever- Hands down my favorite track on here.  Definitely not a \\"we're in love and happy song,\\" but more of a fondly remembering a former love song, this is a song that really gets to you emotionally.  If you want proof that Mariah can emote, listen.  A     11. Daydream Interlude (Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix)- Like most interludes, you can skip over this and it won't ruin the flow, but it is still pleasant.  B     12. Looking In- Lyrically, this is probably the most introspective song on here, which in retospect sounds like she is foreshadowing her impending divorce and reinvention to R&B goddess, but it is a song that can speak to lots of people.  A-    This was Mariah Carey's last full-fledged pop album before becoming more focused on experimenting with her music.  Nothing wrong with that, since a fair share of them are great albums in their own way, but if you want straight up pop music without complications, this is her best album.

B0013D8LOU|4.0|I'll admit, I'm not a musical theatre buff. I am a musician though, and know enough of Sondheim's works to have a deep admiration for him.     That being said, Sweeney Todd is a tremendous undertaking for anyone, because people who know and love the show are already geared up to be the harshest critics. So, in that arena, I have to say it's very subjective as to whether it's good or bad. All I can say to those who thought this was an awful butchering of the show is this: Sondheim approved it. Enough.    Now, to the movie itself -     WOW what a dark show. I was familiar with the premises of it, and with some of the songs, but I didn't know the entire story. Let me just tell you, it's a grisly show, and Burton doesn't hold back from that at all. Were it not a musical, it would be a true horror flick, through and through. Sondheim's music lends a lot of beauty, tragedy, and humor to balance that, but underneath, it's still just dark dark dark. Consider yourself forewarned!    Beyond that, the performances were really very good. Like I said, I'm a musician, and am familiar with Sondheim from a music perspective more than a stage perspective, so I know how difficult these songs are. The actors do just fine. There are times when a critical ear could nitpick Depp's vocal performance, but only in the sense that sometimes you can hear where he doesn't have the great booming strength a trained broadway singer has. Regardless, he nails the parts musically, and brings in a wonderful depth of acting to the vocal performances which easily makes up for anything lacking otherwise. Carter really did great, I think. Rickman was of course perfectly nasty and easily hate-able. The \\"secondary\\" actors playing the parts of Johanna, Toby, and Anthony, were fantastic. Jayne Wisener (Johanna) has such a haunting soprano!    All in all, Sweeney Todd may not be for everyone. If you're a horror buff, you may loathe the fact that this is a musical. If you love musicals but are not familiar withthis one, be prepared that it's non-traditional in the sense that man, it's grim. Very, Very, grim.     I liked it, though, and will own it!

0060005696|2.0|The first third of this book consists of a boatload of statistics and observations about how many choices we have in modern life. A series of self-evident facts, signifying nothing.<br />The next third of the book suggests that choice is sometimes counterproductive and stressful.  I have often observed myself that there are eight varieties of Cap'n Crunch in the store and the original is the only good one.  Choice is not always good.  Kinda knew that.<br />The Third Act, which is what I had hoped would be insightful, reads like a Wayne Dyer greeting card - chill out, breathe, choose what's important, connect with your source, hang in there baby!<br />In response to the stresses of life, one can only chill out so much before starting to ask harder questions about the nature of capitalism and whether our materialist culture is a disgrace to human history.  These are the real issues that books like this are supposed to sort out for us through wise, critical, historical analysis.  There is something wrong with *America* - not *me*.  I just work here.  Sure I can take a bath and eat whole wheat bread and drink more water, but as a citizen of the world, I wanna know why it's all screwed up and what I can do about it.

0143038419|5.0|GET THE BOOK ON CD - I KNOW - UNORTHODOX BUT - I read this book and liked it.  Recommended it for a friend or two and then as a gift for my mother bought the book on CD.  My mother, never having heard a book on CD, immediately put it on in the car later that day.  As we drove Gilbert's story and voiced entranced me.  Having already read the book, the content was familiar but hearing Gilbert's voice and inflection was a whole different experience. Not only was she at liberty to take artistic license with emphasis and inflection, but she truly has a gift for language and accents.  Hearing about attending the Italian soccer match with the profanity language lesson was laugh out loud funny.  Hear the pain in her voice when discussing her inner turmoil and desire for understanding was heart wrenching.      Since listening to the CD and Gilbert's voice as a whole different media experience, I have purchased the CD for two other \\"non-reader\\" friends.  They, too, LOVED it.  One, undergoing chemo at the time, loved being transported by voice to another's struggle for a relationship with self and God (in all its forms).    Really, really, really recommend the CD!
B00003CX9S|5.0|Based on the true life of Joseph Carey Merrick (portrayed brilliantly by John Hurt), David Lynch's masterpiece more or less accurately portrays his experiences only in the last year of his life in 1889-90 once Doctor Frederick Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins) encounters him and cares for him at Whitechapel Hospital. Because of the stage play which left Merrick's physical appearance to the viewer's imagination, this film tended to be voted inferior in comparison. Being fair though, this is a very good film and an unforgettable one at that.<br /><br />In arguably David Lynch's most conventional shoot, there are a couple of misleading events. The film explains Merrick's condition as the result of his mother being struck down by an elephant. He was actually born a normal child. Before the age of two, he had began growing the tumors, and his condition rapidly worsened. Believed to have Proteus Syndrome or \\"Elephant Man's Disease\\" which causes abnormal, unchecked growth of bones, skin, and other systems, the name came to be identified with him. Also, not revealed in the film are what happened to his parents. Research revealed that his mother, also handicapped died when Merrick was 11. His father remarried, and his new wife gave gave him an ultimatum, \\"Joseph, or me.\\" Abandoned and cast out of the home, he went to live at the Leicester Union Workhouse, and sold shoe polish on the street. After being taunted repeatedly by other children, he had to find other work.<br /><br />Desperate for medical attention, a compassionate showman, Tom Norman, UK's answer to P.T. Barnum took him in and gave Merrick a job as a museum freak. Under Norman's tutelage, Merrick accumulated 200 pounds, a large sum of money at the time. However, while touring Belgium, Merrick became separated from his guardian. Naive and sickly, he was a perfect target for robbers, and an unscrupulous Austrian (some say Italian) showman tricked him out of his small fortune. This more than likely was the character portrayed by Freddie Jones in the film.<br /><br />Although those facts were not mentioned in the film, this is nevertheless very accurate. Merrick's association with the upper class, the journey to the theater, his befriending of a famous stage actress, his creativity, and intelligence, and even Merrick's death in the film was portrayed to the tee, based on the earlier reports of Dr. Treves.<br /><br />The DVD has nice documentaries on the making of the film, interviews with the actors, director, and Mel Brooks (who interestingly was the executive producer), and the trailer as features. Overall, an excellent film that is highly recommended.Freddie Jones in the film.     Although those facts were not mentioned in the film, this is nevertheless very accurate.

1400063515|5.0|I recently purchased this book off of Amazon.  I am a long-time customer who has purchased many items, but I have never before been so wonderfully surprised about an item I purchased from the site.  When the book arrived, I opened the packaging and saw the cover of \\"The Black Swan\\".  I was keen to begin reading it so I started thumbing through the book.  Something seemed amiss so I closed the book and took off the book cover to check the hardback binding.  It too read \\"The Black Swan\\".  So I continued to thumb through the pages.  To my amazement, inside the book were the pages of \\"THE AGE OF AMERICAN UNREASON\\" by Susan Jacoby!!    I have yet to begin reading either book (I ordered another \\"The Black Swan\\" which did arrive in proper condition) but imagine the linkage between the randomness proposition of \\"The Black Swan\\" and society's devaluation of knowledge and rationalization precept of \\"The Age of American Unreason\\" will be intriguing.  Do we seek to rationalize otherwise random events because we no longer value knowledge in our society, or does our arrogance preclude us from prioritizing the accumulation of knowledge, thus leading to poor rationalization of events we experience?  Hopefully I will get through both books soon to find out.    Nevertheless, the order was most fulfilling to me because now I have the definitive proof that you can't judge a book by its cover :)

The special effects were stunning but the story really moved me - The music score was beautiful and really tugged at your heart strings - Kong was so realistic and expressive! The other movie with Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges was so cheesy -  The scene near the end where Kong and Ann enjoyed the frozen pond was so beautiful and poignant it  made me cry!

0385338724|4.0|REMEMBER ME? by Sophie Kinsella    April 19, 2008    Rating ****  (4/5 Stars)     Having only read the Shopaholic series by Sophie Kinsella, I wasn't sure if one of her standalones would be worth reading.  However, REMEMBER ME? was a very delightful book, and I'm looking forward to reading more by this author.     The story starts with the main character, Lexi Smart, having drinks with friends in a bar.  As they leave the place, she falls and hits her head. When she awakens, she finds herself in hospital and is told it's now three years later. She is very confused. She is told she has lost her memory and all that had happened to her in the last three years is not even a memory. The last thing she can remember happening was having drinks with her best friends Carolyn, Debs, and Fi. As far as she knows, she was slightly over weight, and was called Snaggletooth by loved ones because of her crooked teeth.  But, looking at herself now, she discovers she has really nice manicured nails, her hair has been nicely done, and she's got very expensive clothes and a designer handbag. Plus, she's lost a lot of weight. Furthermore, she's no longer snaggletooth.  Her teeth have been straightened out!  And, she's no longer single, but married to a very wealthy man. What the hell happened?     REMEMBER ME is Lexi's journey as she tries to put together the puzzle of the last three years of her life. She cannot understand how she had changed so much, and why she married a very wealthy man who doesn't seem to be a good fit for her, at least for the old Lexi Smart.  She has new best friends, her new job is that of the head of the department she used to work for (Flooring), and lives in a very wealthy home in a very wealthy neighborhood. And, she's been told, she was on television. It's a hilarious adventure as Lexi finds out slowly exactly what her life is like now. But the fun of the book is discovering what happened to her to bring her to this new life. It's almost like reading a whodunit, with Lexi being the person who has to find out.      Part of the fun was Lexi rediscovering her old friends, women who now would have nothing to do with her. Because the reader was introduced to her character before her memory loss, we are with her all the way as she goes on a search for her past life. The reader will also enjoy putting the pieces together, never a step ahead of Lexi, which makes her self-discovery as much of a surprise to the reader as it is to Lexi. The introduction to a business partner of her husband, Jon, holds the key to who Lexi really is, causing Lexi to struggle with who she knows she is deep inside.  But she is having a hard time reaching that person she used to be.     REMEMBER ME ? was a very fun read, reminiscent of the Shopaholic books, but the main character is not as aggravating and annoying as I know many readers found Becky Bloomwood, the Shopaholic.  Lexi is a lot smarter than Becky, as is shown from her track record from being just another flunky in flooring, to becoming a director who had saved the company from ruin. REMEMBER ME? is Lexi's quest to find her real self, to try to remember who she was and where she came from, and where she should be going, whether it be with her new wonderful husband Eric, or someone else entirely. - Courtesy of Love Romances and More - M.

0143038419|3.0|She hints that there is overlap between her ex-husband and David...why does no one pick up on this? When I read that she was in David's apartment in her India section (page 124), I found it off-putting and had a lot less sympathy for her and her sense of spirtual enlightenment.  If in fact she did cheat, then she should stop pitying herself so greatly and stop blaming her husband.  This is not to say he did not have wrongs or faults, but I firmly believe if you're not happy and you feel your marriage is over, this is still no excuse for cheating. She should have addressed her own moral perspective on this to give her readers a better perspective into how harshly or kindly to view her moral standards. I did find some of her writing to be a bit too far fetched and perhaps exaggerated in order to sell a book.  Otherwise, the book is thought provoking and therefore the level of stars in my review.

I went to Macy's and tried some of the perfumes, mostly because I was interested in Azuree.  Not a good mix with my chemistry. In fact, the \\"Azuree\\" everyone touts as divine is not the original stinky stuff, but the Tom Ford for Estee Lauder Azuree, which is quite light and lovely.    And the reason I would have loved to have known what composes each perfume is patchouli NEVER works on me...a chemistry thing, despite the denials. So the patchouli and heaven knows what else in Azuree original gagged me. The eensiest amount ruins every perfume that contains it for me. Some of the vague descriptors of perfumes: Soapy green, oily woody, earthy fresh, floral mishmash...what does this mean? URGGGH. Still, I do like having so many perfumes listed to read about. But I wish they'd go back and list the ingredients and reconfigure a more manageable index. So I think I'll add a star and make it 3.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I've been with Lara Croft since the first Tomb Raider game--the version for Sony Playstation--and I can tell you this is not only a great way to screw up a perfectly good setting and a perfectly good story, but also a great way to screw up a main character.  Sure, I believe in evolution; by the time this movie began production, Lara Croft had been the protagonist of every game in the Playstation series FIVE times at this point.<br /><br />First off, the first game was the only one with this combination: an interesting character, a good plot, interesting dialogue, an interesting script, a music score that works, an interesting setting albeit a not-so-action-oriented one but nonetheless immersive and captivating, mostly non-fictional-type enemies (like birds, bats, tigers, you know, animals of the forest, and a few humans too), a \\"free-roaming\\" three-dimensional world, and even good voice acting.  This combination was a real development for videogames because, before the first game released in 1996--1995 on another system--not many of these things happened.  But, the quality of all of these thing noted here had changed in the sequel games.  Some things had just-as-good quality and some things were not just-as-good, depending on the sequel.  As a series, the first game was really a push for Lara as a character.  It is essential to carry the traits of that character forward into the sequels.  But, after five games on the Playstation, if anyone's going to make a movie and call it \\"Tomb Raider,\\" if anyone's going to depict the titanic \\"Lara Croft,\\" one must be faithful, regardless of whether or not its writers decide to include the transformations in the sequel games or not--it doesn't matter.<br /><br />At the heart of things, Lara Croft is the daughter of an English aristocrat.  I can't tell you why anyone would ever think that Angelina Jolie, as likable and sexy as she is, would fit this character.  Does Jolie even attempt to put on an English accent?  No.  So then, I guess none of the storylined traits exist, and this film is solely about selling tickets and purifying the entire visual scenery when, in the game, this is not the purified thing.  And, in the game, it is Lara who appears sanitary only to prove otherwise, and that this is an important function of the character.  In this film, the character Lara Croft may as well have been the daughter of a New York City crack addict, because there is no sharing resemblance to the original game's ideas.<br /><br />The Tomb Raider game was a genre piece.  It was only like the first ten minutes of the first film in the Indiana Jones series--or the protagonist of the old Atari, Activision game Pitfall--but it was more particularly supposed to be like, in plot, a marginally science fiction piece similar to the first ten minutes of The Fifth Element or the last hour-and-a-half of Stargate.  The plot of the first game was about a rugged and youthful daughter of a wealthy aristocrat who did not share in the interests of dirty corporate politics, and so her character juxtaposes them.  The story did not have Lara hating aristocratic wealth, but rather accepting it because she had been born into it, but with an appetite for adventure and the means to get there, financially, physically, and intellectually.  She's the kind of girl who must rather have been an Oxford University student of archeology than a politician like her parents--or whatever they did to make money, probably inheriting it and some titles from the English monarchy as well.  It just doesn't make sense to dispose of this past!  It's in Lara's genetic makeup.  One can't just remove these things and make a good movie starring Lara Croft; it's more than that.<br /><br />Also is the problem of just plain bad decisions all around about the sanitized visuals and sanitized plot.  This film is just an action piece with dopey characters that Lara must avoid.  This isn't what Lara started out doing!  There were dopey characters, but Laraused to be an educated young woman.  In this film, she is just a female Rambo who likes caves.  There's no excuse for what she does in this film.  It's just stupidity.  Too much has been changed and, cinematically, the movie itself is either boring or has too many flaws.  It possesses very little of the originality in the first game, a coherent plot involving something better than a bunch of stupid moron-minded humans with the animals of the forest missing, all because Lara's gone and changed into James Bond now.  This film is a stupid action piece without a shred of credibility or intrigue, two things that abundantly made the first game so memorable.an.

B0000DG00B|5.0|excellent live album. ranks a close second to fillmore east, mountain jam on the second disk really smokes. actually like it better than the fillmore version.
B0009F9O6M|5.0|The 3rd album from this great band \\" H to He Who Am the Only One \\" has to be the best title an album ever had!<br />  Robert Fripp of King Crimson played on \\"Emperor in His War Room\\" 3rd track side one ..`a classic  interwinding jazz, art, & space-rock, and what was to become Hammills signature vocal and writing style for years to come.<br />  This 1970 release was also years ahead of other bands their equal as far as artistic development and commercial appeal. The cover by Paul Whitehead also reflected the times and its first side opened with \\"Killer\\" probably the one song the band found to be \\" an albatross around our necks\\" as PH put it. Nic Potter the bassist unfortunately left in the middle of the recording due to his  concepts of the world and the occult witch he feared the band was reaching out to. He would resurface again 7 years later for the \\"Over\\" sessions ....an excellent bassist  who would be greatly missed. He would also be bassist for the band in 1977 when they dropped the \\"Generator ' from their name...putting out a studio & live album and singles also...sadly then they broke up for good...also included was violinist Graham  Smith.<br />  But this an album of great importance as far as time of release and what it lead to their magnus opus the following year , witch was \\"Pawn Hearts\\" speaking of Pawn Hearts ~it was to be a double album with the second side just being the band live in the studio, sadly only one track \\"Squid 1/ Squid 2/ Octopus \\" survives and it is magnificent!!!!!!!!!!! VDGG LIVE at their BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000005AYM|5.0|Amazing sound, Very creative and with a good team of musicians -  The best CD of Eryka.... It worth each penny spent!  Buy it!
B00005NTJK|5.0|The third effort by one of the foremost progressive bands to first take hold of the most interesting music coming out of England at that time. Hints of Sgt. pepper and piper at the gates and a more definitive statement than \\"Stand Up\\" witch is also brilliant ! But this effort sadly the last with original bassist Glen Corneck who was dumped by Ian @ JFK on christmass  eve 1970. His ability as a musician is a major force in the original inception of the band. His long hair and head  band was just as trade mark as Ians, maybe thats why the dumping. Guitarist  Martin Baree  sounds like eric clapton on acid in a good way! Old school friend John Evans  joined the band and also made an impact. But the true master Ian Anderson dazzles the senses with his brilliant and intelligent writing and singing of this masterful album!!!!!!!!!!!
0792833279|5.0|I even liked this more than \\"Pulp Fiction\\" which was quite good.  Strange and funny creation-plus the music is perfect!  Overall a great ride of a film.  Some of the best \\"character\\" actors of recent times are in this.  Just a blast to watch!--Dave K

0743496736|4.0|This book kept me involved and reading often throughout the day. But I found the novel:We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver much more indepth. The realistic feelings of school shootings and the effect on others were more profound in the Lionel Shriver novel, which I coundn't put down. I did like the portrayal of Josie  in Nineteen Minutes.A girl who leaned on her boyfriend and took his abuse being she was estranged from her father and wanted to be loved by a male figure.This gave me insight into this plight.

B00005R8GU|4.0|Released for the first time in 1969 as a double LP album, this record was digitally remastered and published on CD in 2001, with some bonus tracks. Tracks 1-14 are recorded in studio, while 15-20 are performed live at the Super Cosmic Joy-Scout Jamboree, Chicago.  The project was conceived around the idea of a \\"passing of the torch\\" from fathers (Otis Spann, Muddy Waters) to sons (Michael Bloomfield, Paul Butterfield and more) of blues music. It turns around a classic review of Muddy's warhorses (Long Distance Call, Baby Please Don't Go, Honey Bee...) in addiction with other milestones of blues history (I'm Ready, by Willie Dixon, Got My Mojo Working, by Preston Foster and more), giving rise to a tight electric blues recording, in a perfect Chicago style.  The highlights are Muddy's deep black voice and Butterfield's brilliant harmonica lines, while Bloomfield's guitar seems to be a little obscured by such duets.  This record brings back to the listener the genuine atmosphere of the mature age of electric blues, with \\"vintage\\" sounds captured in the late 60's.    Riccardo Frau  Italy

B00003CXZ4|5.0|The reason Memento is so amazing is that it's told in reverse.  It's completely unique, a trend-setting idea.  There are small tidbits at a time, just enough to give a clue about what happened.  It's a truly amazing idea that keeps a viewer slightly off-center the entire movie.  Memento is truly ground-breaking when it comes to the movie-making aspect and story-telling style in cinema.<br /><br />The basic story of Memento is about revenge.  When someone wrongs someone you love, to what lengths would you go to avenge their death?  Now, throw in a slight road-block: you have no short-term memory.<br /><br />Leonard (Guy Pierce) wakes up unaware of anything.  The only clues he has are tattooed all over his body.  On his arms, on his chest, everywhere there is a patch of skin he has notes to himself.  The only thing he knows is that all his tattoos, and several polaroid photos, are clues towards the mystery that is his wife's rape and murder.<br /><br />The wide-reaching impact of short-term memory loss is immense.  A person could never go to school, learn a new language, quote a recent conversation, or visit an interesting site that was just happened upon.  And, depending on when the memory lapse hit, a person could forget something a simple as wiping after going to the bathroom.<br /><br />Of course, that could come in handy if someone happened to have a dreadful one night stand; they'd never have to own up to it.  Maybe they have a favorite book; each time it would be the best book ever.  Each surprise movie ending would be the same time and again (would really help when watching movies like Sixth Sense).<br /><br />Either way, the movie is incredibly well made, and a unique idea amidst a sea of retread garbage typically put out by major Hollywood productions.
0800141849|5.0|What can I say, other than this is a soon to be classic Barbara film. She wrote, stared, and produced it! Is there any end to her talents?<br />Self promotion? Why not!
B00008K7AM|2.0|It's hard to put this any other way, The Hot Chick is one of worst movies in the history of cinema.  Frankly, I'm amazed that any serious actor would even give this pile of garbage a second look, and since Rachel McAdams and Anna Farris are the only serious actresses - and that's being quite generous - it's clear that everyone involved is either a career masochist, or completely oblivious to how bad the idea for this movie was when they read the script.  And if it's the latter, then they have the decision making skills of an infant.<br /><br />The plot of this movie - and I'm using the words plot and movie loosely - is based off of the tired storyline where one person has their personality switched with another.  In this case, it's an incompetent male theif (Rob Schneider) being switched with the typical, prettiest girl in the class (Rachel McAdams) who also happens to be heinously mean.<br /><br />It's up to the girl (Schneider) and her/his friends to find out how and with whom the switch took place.  Unfortunately, the people behind this travesty decided it would be a good idea to have Rob Schneider not only dress in women's clothes, but also chose a size that would only have worked if he were 50 lbs. lighter.  Aside from that, the movie is awkward in that \\"accidentally waving to someone who's waving to someone behind you\\" sort of way.  From nail-painting scenes, pillow fights, and an entire movie full of scenes of a 40-year old guy hanging out with three teenage girls, it just fails on every single possible level.<br /><br />The most preposterous part of the entire movie is the fact that a teenage girl goes missing for an entire week, and her parents hardly even notice.<br /><br />I'm sure there's a message in there, a completely insane message of tranny-acceptance or something like that, and an completely failed attempt at cohesion, but I started to feel nauseous after about 30 minutes of seeing Schneider's ugly mug in Hello Kitty t-shirts; so, I obviously had to fight through the rest of the trainwreck.trainwreck.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is absolutely hilarious. I watch the show and think \\"these are my people.\\" Sad, but true. I know plenty of people like them. A few of us in college watch it, and we share stories about how half of the stuff from the show happened to us / our friends / boyfriends / girlfriends. It's amazing.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This is a must buy if you like stargate even a little bit. The special effects on this one are a bit better than normal. It also ties up the ori storyline well enough that I am truly satisfied. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE BORING PART. I don't know how, but this story is never boring or slows down. They did a great job releasing this and I dont feel bad for paying for an extended episode movie type thing on dvd. All of the characters are pretty much given their respect, especially one I hated, Toeman. There could be some more samantha carter scenes but really if you have seen all the stargate episodes it doesnt matter. I have already watched this dvd twice, and three times if you count the extras. Worth the money, so buy it for yourself or as a gift.

B000YCLRBA|4.0|Tchaikovsky's dramatic score depicting Pushkin's tale of unrequited love is movingly portrayed by Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Onegin and Renée Fleming  as Tatiana.  With his rich, long-phrased baritone and artful characterisation Hvorostovsky brings to life a very credible Onegin,  adapting from his cool response to Tatiana's letter to the empassioned profession of love in Act 3.  Fleming's Tatiana dovetails this as a convincing ingénue in Act 1 leading to the honour-bound wife of Act 3.  Her warm lyrical soprano producing a moving 'letter scene'.  The production cleverly presents the action as taking place in Onegin's memory, starting with him alone on stage, during the orchestral introduction, holding Tatiana's letter,  All around him are autumn leaves,  some falling from between the pages of the letter, suggesting a mood of love lost.
0812975219|2.0|I managed to read the entire book (which means its an easy read and decent enough. I will not go so far as to say its worthless, as I say its a 'decent' book). So, here's my bottom line. Each chapter has the same unfounded examples-- Taleb casually mentions someone did something and concludes 'see, its random'. He does this over and over again. Fortunately, he concludes the book by acknowledging he's as dumb as the rest of us. His thesis does seem to have 1 definitive source of proof: by random chance many, many people (including me) have been fooled into buying this random book. Maybe his 2nd book, Black Swan, is an improved version-- I would suggest (randomly, since I haven't read it) to just start with Black Swan.
B000NA28I4|3.0|This movie is ok, I guess. The book of this is WAY better than this. This movie took out alot of parts from the book and it seems like they rushed everything. I wasn't that impressed, but check it out, it's still pretty good and entertaining. But read the book first, it's awesome!
057507874X|4.0|I read this book for the first time about 16 years ago, when I was 10 or 11 years old.  I was so impressed by the book, which had gripped me with its enchanting prose, that I immediately re-read it.  Over the next couple years, I read several other works by Ray Bradbury and I periodically tried to imitate his style for school projects.  I loved the book.<br /><br />I just re-read it for the third time, and I was still bewitched.  Ray Bradbury's writing is impressive!  He is poetic, and his writing perfectly fits the spooky subject of the book.  In the book, there are dark characters whose bodies are covered with tattooed illustrations or who have been squashed down to resemble dwarves, and Ray Bradbury's writing, which is full of images, metaphors, and poetry, captured these characters and provided a great accompaniment for the book's story.<br /><br />Rereading it, now, after many years, I understood the book in a different way.  The book's repeated discussion of immortality stuck with me, and has a different significance for me now.  Also, between the first reading and this third, I had learned a bit more about Ray Bradbury's life.  Did you know that Bradbury claims that, at a young age, he met a circus performer called Mr. Electrico?  According to Bradbury, this performer, who had electric current pumped through him in front of a crowd of people, pointed his sword at Bradbury and declared:  \\"You will live forever!\\"  Knowing this story had a significant, and I think positive, impact on my reading!<br /><br />Finally, I'm glad that so many reviewers have liked this book.  That's great.  At times, I wondered whether other people would like Bradbury's wild writing, which jumps around, and calls forth images, and which captures the dark magic of the performing freaks.  On a few rare instances, the prose felt forced, or seemed vaguely pretentious, or felt too overdrawn . . . But, when the writing seemed like this, the sour impression would only last for a moment before the story once again swallowed me whole.<br /><br />I was very glad that so many readers have found Bradbury's prose appealing.n swallowed me whole.    I was very glad that so many readers have found Bradbury's prose appealing.
B000B19BCG|4.0|I really enjoyed the record. I didn't even know that it existed until a few months ago, but Im glad that I came across it.<br /> The title track \\"Road to Rouen\\" is full of life. It's got that funky riff that would make any quiet person feel like a pornstar. Fin is the perfect way to end the album. Quiet, somewhat hushed vocals. It leaves me in peace.<br /> I recommend this record to people who didn't like early Supergrass stuff. It will surprise you.
B00133MKVK|4.0|What an inspiration Dame Shirley Bassey is!  When I first heard her on NPR's Saturday Weekend Edition, I was totally wowed.  Her sultry, strong voice reverberates with passion, youth and sexiness.  The CD is fabulous.  My favorites are the title track and \\"Big Spender\\".  I was hoping for \\"Goldfinger\\" to be on it but it must not have been destined.  If I could offer 4.5 stars, I would, because this CD is pretty close to perfection.
0316067598|4.0|As (many) others have mentioned, this is a very good book and a gripping read. The book has two main contributions. First, a terrific depiction of SEAL training. I knew, abstractly, it was super-tough - this account, all the more powerful because it's so matter-of-fact and understated, really brings it home - you want to fly down to San Diego and shake the hands of the next graduating class. Second, the description of his combat mission in Afghanistan is top-notch. He does a very good job of first outlining the situtation (the terrain, the situation with Pakistan, the difference between the Taliban and the Pushtuns, etc.), and then does an amazing reconstruction of the actual battle itself - given how long it was, how injured he was, and his later ordeal, it is _incredible_ how well he remembers and recounts it. The amazing combat skill of the SEALS, not just their physical skills but their mental skills, is awesome. The feats each of the SEALs, but especially the author, managed, is almost literally incredible. Amazing.    My only quibble with the book is that the author has swallowed whole the whole Limbaugh/Hannity/Fox propaganda - the book is periodically interspersed with rants against \\"liberals\\", \\"the liberal media\\", \\"lefties\\", etc., who are portrayed as at the least weak and stupid, at the worst treasonous.    This isn't the place for a flame war, I'll only say that as a proud liberal, who loves America and is full of respect for the US military, the SEALS and the author (just see above), this saddened me.    (Codicil added later) - at the recommendation of other reviewers, after reading this book I went out and read \\"Not a good day to die\\" by Sean Naylor. There's a section there where a small special forces team, inserted into Afghanistan for reconaissance, runs the risk of being discovered by a goatherd - the precise same situation as in this book. Interestingly, in Naylor's scenario, this is all brushed off in about two sentences - \\"of course, we wouldn'tshoot him if discovered. And of course, if discovered, we'd assume the worst and leave immediately\\". This makes me wonder a bit about the author's portrayal of this key scenario - is he blaming the ROE for his own groups poor judgement? Gave me pause.
0061142026|3.0|It's hard to review a book after seeing the movie, especially if the book came first.  Part of you keeps on wanting to read the same thing as the movie, only more of it.<br /><br />This book is a fairly different animal.  There are elements that Gaiman does much better, like not including that strange subplot of a gay cross-dressing sky pirate in the movie.  There are other aspects that don't round out as well as [[ASIN:B000WZAE1I the movie]], particularly the epilogue.<br /><br />Mostly, this is a fun romp, filled with magic and fairy tale life, that just doesn't have anything extra to offer it.  Gaiman hasn't created new creatures as in the [[ASIN:1585678996 City of Dreaming Books]], or created a new intricate land, as [[ASIN:0007136587 Tolkien]] did.  His characters aren't ones that pull you into them, and there are elements of the plot that skip over days or months where you would want details.<br /><br />If you're looking for something relaxing, this book is just fine.  But it reads as if Geiman had a good idea, and then ran out of time before his next book, and couldn't be bothered with truly enfleshing this one out.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I saw this movie back in the 70's...purchased it on DVD and watched again... 25 years later !? -- Love it...you can see and feel the passion and love that these two \\"stars\\" feels for each other.  Sweet movie.
B00003CWPL|3.0|I have heard about this film ever since I was a small child.  Finally, I got a chance to watch it today.  Really bizarre film and dark film.  Many of the images in the film were disgusting and disturbing.  The sound effects were pretty intense as well.  Its a truly jarring experience to watch this film.  I cannot say that I genuinely enjoyed watching this film but I am glad that I finally saw it after being so curious for so long.  Its a truly one of a kind film but I don't think I will watch it again.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|I rented it thinking I'd be disappointed; I LOVED Hot Fuzz, but I'm not into zombie/horror crap. But this was at least just as hilarious, if not more. You really have to be aware of what's going on in the background, though, which makes this a great movie to watch more than once. In the scene where they leave the pub singing and call to the woman who appears to be dancing with a man, \\"what's wrong love, haven't you had your tea yet?\\"she's actually gnawing on the man's neck, and when they turn around, you can see his head fall off...they, of course, are so drunk that they miss it. This is just one of the many, many well-played humorous bits in it.
B00104QSOM|3.0|Yes a movie about oil really is that boring. I'm sure all the great and wonderful themes the critics were all raving about is in this movie somewhere, ie: Greed, power, family, etc...However, it's nothing that I haven't seen before.  The movie was longer than it needed to be. The musical score felt incredibly forced and ridiculously over the top. I felt as if it was trying to ring and emotion out of the viewers. Sort of like a horror movie that is only pretending to be scary because of the loud music. That is how I felt watching There Will Be Blood. Except it wasn't scary, or engaging. In fact, for the most part, it was quite boring. Yes, Daniel Day-Lewis is wonderful in this, no question. But a man cannot make a movie. Or at least, not one with a boring premise to begin with. I am not even going to comment on the ending as there are plenty of reviews that feel as I do. I am not going to say that this movie had no significant point, however, for such a long, drawn-out plot, it sure made it diffucult to even care about it.
B00139W3NE|2.0|OK, I confess that I haven't read the book, so I approach this as a piece of cinema. It is nicely filmed and the visual effects are lush and pretty (even though some of the daemons don't look that realistic some of the time). However, I just couldn't accept the plotline, such as it was. It is, as I said above, too silly for words. Now I know that the books have come under considerable fire from the loony wing of the US evangelical community for the atheistic views that Mr. Pullman is said to have built into them and which, they said, he was trying to inculcate into children. Perhaps this explains the dilution of the story from the book into a rather insipid kids' adventure yarn. The one highlight for me was Nicole Kidman's chilling villain. Nothing else.<br /><br />The comments of some of the other reviewers have persuaded me to read the book, to see what might have been.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie has been my favorite since I was about ten.  It is very good, and I loved it since me and my brother watched it for the first time.  I would get it at the library again, and again, well i got bored getting it there, so i decided to buy it, and im so glad that I did.
0553208845|5.0|Although the story of a young Brahmin seeking enlightenment may seem as though it couldn't be applicable to the life of a college student, this couldn't be farther from the truth.  The story, although very specifically centered around an idea and life I will never experience, is perfection as it relates to a life journey.<br /><br /> Siddhartha encounters many obstacles and is pulled away from what he believes to be the focus of his life numerous times through out the story.  This is a fundamental problem in every human life.  This is the struggle to keep on the straight and narrow and achieve what we believe to be perfection in our lives.  The story is simply that of a single individual striving to find a happiness that has no equal.  This is indeed the great leveler in life.  No matter age, creed, gender, or what have you, humans are only concerned with finding happiness.  This book transcends all barriers and is story that all can find at least one point relatable to their lives.  It is a great read and a great journey.  It is worth the money to be able to read a book that motivates you to keep looking forward and keep striving for that final goal.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|(Spoilers involving the book \\"I Am Legend\\" lie ahead)<br /><br />There is something about post-apocalyptic tales and zombie horrors that fascinate us and draw us in.<br /><br />This is a taut and fairly suspenseful scifi/horror film that kept my attention. It is better than what I expected. When I learned that Hollywood was doing a film of my favorite vampire story (the third film version so far based on Richard Matheson's gripping novella), I winced and groaned. They'll ruin it, I thought. Well, the film is not bad. That being said, it's not excellent either.<br /><br />The digital zombies are just that. Digital-looking, if you get my meaning. Why do so many CGI monsters look unrealistic? I can't put my finger on it. Could be skin tones, or a certain lifelessness in the eyes, or the way they move? Hard to pinpoint. But these rabid monsters were cumbersome looking. They were loud and big, but not frightening enough for me. I felt half the time like I was watching a video game. The closeups especially were awful, reminding you that this face was created on a laptop by some guy with orange Cheese Doodle grit all over his fingers. And yet the zombie lab rats (and the zombie dogs in the city) were freaky scary. Go figure.<br /><br />There are some positive things about the movie. Silences instead of musical score accentuate the suspense; particularly in scenes such as when Robert Neville is looking for his dog Sam in some creepy, dark rooms. Incidental music would possibly have taken away from the feeling of dread in sequences like that. I liked the quiet. It was scary and tense.<br /><br />The movie doesn't become too much of a zombie flick; it remains more of a character study involving a man who has passed the edge of sanity but is fighting hard to crawl back. Will Smith is good, as usual. I don't think there's much he couldn't do as an actor.<br /><br />There's very little handheld, 'cinema verite' style camera work, I am happy to report. Lately a few horror movies are copying the visual style of The Blair Witch Project.<br /><br />There will be people who see this film and want to bury it in their back yard or hide it in the freezer along with Bambi, Charlotte's Web, and Old Yeller. I just hope they do not dismiss this film simply because it is realistic and sometimes sad. Those who have seen the movie know what I am referring to. I must confess that I had tears in my eyes at one point. Luckily the scene was handled very discreetly; but any way you do it, it's still heartbreaking.<br /><br />This is a loose interpretation of the book. People looking for a faithful adaptation will be sour after seeing this. After I read the book (many moons ago) I had it in my mind as a movie. It was so involving and scary. There was a scene in the book in which Robert Neville is driving home in the late afternoon and discovers that his wristwatch has stopped, and dusk is fast approaching. I was on the edge of my seat. Would he make it home safely before they came out of their hiding places? Good stuff. This sequence, unfortunately, was foolishly and sadly left out of this film. Heaven knows why. I was hoping it would be included. Hollywood seldom gets it right.<br /><br />Bottom line: the film isn't atrocious. I enjoyed it because I didn't compare it too much to its source material. I would call it more thriller than outright horror.ch Project.

B00133KFGW|5.0|A great movie!  The music was fantastic, and the story line is good.  Freddie Highmore (August) is very convincing in his role as a boy trying to find his parents, running away from a boys' home to 'follow the music' into the city.  The idea is a little far-fetched, but the story unfolds and brings you in to feel the emotions of the boy and his parents, all separated in the beginning, only to find each other at the end.  It's happy, sad, ironic, and joyful and as a whole, a great show for anyone who loves music because you can relate to the characters through the music.
1931559317|5.0|For many years I was in search of a detailed deep sky atlas that fit on my lap, was easy to read, and concentrated on a single constellation for every page.  This atlas has come closest to fitting that description!    This atlas has an excellent amount of detail. It centers most of the constellations nicely, so there is minimal cutoff and hardly any need to flip between pages to see the rest of the constellation you are interested in.  The symbols follow almost the same format as the Tirion charts.  Some companies offer this in a chemically treated version, making the pages more resistant to moisture.  I found the pages  heavy stock adaquate enough to handle dew quite well without any chemical treatment.  The sprial binding allows you to keep the atlas folded in half, so it sits on your lap nicely.  No more running back to the table to read the atlas, then back to the EP.  You can stay put!    Highly recommended!
B000QXDED6|1.0|When I saw the trailers for this movie I knew there was going to be an immediate problem. After watching the movie my suspicions were confirmed. The battle of Thermopylae, as it's presented here, is mythologized. This battle was a real battle & unfortunately what's presented here isn't real. I get the impression that Zack Snyder, the director, had watched Lord of the Rings about 12 times too many. Lord of the Rings was fantasy, filming it as such was the right thing to do. The Battle of Thermopylae was a real event & deserves to be portrayed that way. The other big problem with the movie stems from too much computer graphics. All the brown & yellow colors kept me wanting to add more brightness on my tv.     I know this is an action movie & that's what it focuses on but in no way did I feel that it was believable. The portrayal of Leonidas by Gerard Butler has to be one of the worst things ever done in a movie. But I'll give him some credit; he had very little to work with script-wise. In fact, there isn't any character development at all in this movie. Gerard seemed to base his character on Mel Gibson's Braveheart. There seemed to be a couple of times when he almost slipped into a Scottish brogue.     There are some factual things in this movie but they are minimized except for, perhaps, the training of Leonidas as a youth. But almost everything I saw here reminded of a bad version of Lord of the Rings. The cast off Spartan hunchback was Gollum, The chained guy was a cave troll, the Immortals were orcs, the elephants, the rhinoceros (please!!!) was like the huge hyena creatures the orcs rode. And what's with the androgynous portrayal of Xerxes?    I could go on & on about what's wrong with this movie. The other thing about a movie is its entertainment value. Well, I did find 300 somewhat entertaining but not in the way the director intended. This is some lame stuff. This battle was a real event & should've been portrayed as such. I'm just glad I borrowed this dvd, Iwouldn't buy it or rent it.

1563899426|4.0|At first glance one might get the impression that `Fables' was a straight rip-off of the film `Enchanted' except for the fact that the series started about five years before `Enchanted' was released in theaters. The characters in the series, taken from classic fantasy stories include Snow White, Prince Charming, Old King Cole, the Big Bad Wolf, Bluebeard and so on. They have been forced from their homelands by `The Adversary' and now live in the real world among us `Mundys' (Mundanes). Despite being characters from legendary fiction most come off as generally ordinary people. The Big Bad Wolf (or Bigby) briefly changes into his natural wolf form and Prince Charming is a rather vapid, narcissist as in `Enchanted' but I never would have thought of Snow White as Snow White if it weren't for the fact that she's referred to as Snow White. The first five issues revolve around a murder mystery with a classic `parlor room' finale whereby the lead detective reveals all the sorted details.<br /><br />I really need to learn to keep my expectations in check. `Fables' has won eleven Eisner Awards (for comic excellence) and was complimented by IGN as \\"the best comic book currently being produced\\". That's some pretty high praise. D.C. comics Vertigo line has produced a slew of critically acclaimed series including Sandman, Hellblazer and Y: The Last Man and without exception I have found them less enthralling than hoped for. Sandman was a very good series, I have the first half dozen books but it never reached the level of other legendary comic series. When I think of superstar comics I think of Alan Moore's Swamp Thing or Miracleman. I think of Frank Miller's Dark Knight or The Ultimates by Mark Miller. I just haven't been `blown away' by any of the Vertigo comics I've read.<br /><br />I guess the litmus test for me is would I buy another book in the series. Getting into a new series requires time and money. In the case of `Y: The Last Man' I bought the first compilation book and made a decision not to continue. `Fables' was touch and go to the end but I think I'll pick up another one, I'm just not in a huge hurry to do it. Don't get me wrong. It's a very good book but it's more of a fine, well crafted book rather than a powerful, emotional one.made a decision not to continue. `Fables' was touch and go to the end but I think I'll pick up another one, I'm just not in a huge hurry to do it.

B000002OOY|5.0|The music is as good as the movie and they are a perfect match. I cant imagine Jurassic Park without this music. This music has added a great value to the movie. This score is the reason I started an avid interest in movie soundtracks.
0743277708|5.0|Adapted from ISawLightningFall.blogspot.com    Watership Down has a lot in common with the ancient epics. In it, a lone warrior leads a band of harried outcasts into the wilderness in search of a home. They're aided by a seer who can touch the future with his dreams. They face perilous quests and hair-breadth escapes, ferocious foes and desperate siege assaults. But unlike the works of Homer and Virgil, Watership Down is also about rabbits. Which is appropriate, as almost all of its characters are rabbits.    Most four-footed protagonists in literature have been little more than humans with fur. (Think Stuart Little or Redwall.) But Adams takes a very different tack, which is evident from the get-go. The tale begins with two young rabbits named Hazel and Fiver living in a peaceful warren ruled by an old veteran named the Threarah. Scrawny, meditative Fiver has premonitions of doom falling on them all, a doom that will stain the fields with rabbit blood. But when the Threarah ignores Fiver's counsel, Hazel decides to rouse anyone he can and flee. The two are joined by Bigwig (a massive bruiser once part of the Threarah's personal guard), Dandelion (a storyteller par excellence), Blackberry (the smart-as-a-whip innovator) and Pipkin (a loyal but timid runt). When the Threarah's minions discover their plans, the motley crew must plunge into the wilds under threat of death.    Adams' break with Disney-esque anthropomorphizing becomes even more apparent in the culture he created for his rabbits. Much like Tolkien did in The Lord of the Rings, Adams created a language with its own detailed grammar and vocabulary. An example: Fiver's true name, Hrairoo, comes from hrair, the term for any number over four, which is how high rabbits can count. They call these greater sums \\"thousand,\\" and Fiver's name literally means \\"little thousand.\\" He was so christened because he was small and one of the last born in his litter. Other words that crop up -- including elil (\\"predators\\"), silflay (\\"to graze\\") and narn (\\"something good to eat\\") -- possess equally detailed explanations. Frith, the word for the sun, is particularly interesting since it contains religious connotations. The rabbits, you see, are sun worshippers. They adore Lord Frith and the first rabbit he created, El-ahrairah, whose mischievous exploits get recounted several times in detail and who would put Odysseus to shame with his inventiveness.    Part of the joy of reading Watership Down lies in not only in its mythological color, but in letting yourself be carried along by every twist and turn of the plot, which is half adventure and half thriller (with a smattering of British botany, warren geography and seagull dialect thrown in to keep things interesting). If you find it hard to believe that it could be a coherent read with so many disparate elements (much less an entertaining one), join the crowd. It took months of nagging from a friend to get me to crack its cover. But it most certainly works, which is a testimony to Adams' skill, as is the fact that when you reach the final page, you've begun to feel that Hazel and his friends are every bit as courageous as Achilles or Aeneas -- no matter the length of their ears.
1401216676|5.0|this is one of the best batman stories you can read from someone other that Kane himself. though there are a lot of good stories of batman, the villians never had a great long back story. but Alan Moore has brought us this piece of genius that takes us through the mind of batman's arch-enemy the joker. this is a great buy if you weren't able to buy the original. it's a great and if you liked this than consider Arkham Asylum by Grant Morrison.

0307388840|3.0|When a highly touted book receives such varied customer reviews, I've got to read it.  And I can't resist adding my voice to the many reviews already posted.  What an odd book this is.<br /><br />It begins portraying domestic life in the English countryside.  The only person who regularly goes to town is the sketchily drawn father.  The mother takes to her bed frequently to avoid the apparently very real, migraines she is cursed with.  The children and staff live in the country as if insulated from the world by a chintz tea-cozy.  The oldest daughter's dilemma in choosing a dress for dinner is described, \\"...she wanted to look as though she had not given the matter a moment's thought...Soon her mother would appear and want to discuss the table placings, Paul Marshall would come down from his room and be in need of company, and then Robbie would be at the door.  How was she to think straight?\\"  Difficulties, indeed.  This tightly enclosed domestic scene is set, and the hypocrisy of the British upper class is gently skewered.  This portion of the book climaxes when the youngest daughter, Briony, a self-centered, overly dramatic 13 year old mis-interprets actions of the adults; accuses, testifies, and is the cause of the public damnation of one of the young men.  Suddenly, the scene shifts dramatically.<br /><br />WWII descends on their lives abruptly.  The wrongly convicted young man is fighting in France.  The story of his service is not of predictable noble heroism.  It is the ugly, dispiriting retreat of the English army from France back to Britain. This may be the most affecting portion of the book, but any waggish views of British life are left firmly in the first part of the book.  It is a sad, cruel journey he makes.  And his fate is telegraphed loud and clear; the continuous jabs of shrapnel in his side, into his ribs, against his organs, leave little doubt that he will not complete his journey.<br /><br />Before this ends though, the book shifts (again) to the life of the now grown Brionywho is in nursing training.  Her duties, mostly the lowliest in the hospital, include endless cleaning of bed pans and other distasteful jobs.  So, is this the \\"atonement\\" for her former errors we have been promised?  It seems not. The older daughter who had so much difficulty choosing a dress becomes a nurse and is promptly promoted to Ward Sister; a position which requires a \\"she who must be obeyed\\" personality.  No explanation for this personality shift is explored.  It just happens.<br /><br />Then things get dicey indeed.  A walk the younger girl takes to visit her long estranged sister is described in tremendous detail.  It is not a very interesting walk, but each observation, no matter how mundane, is  recorded.  In fact, in my paperback copy, the description of this tedious walk goes on for 17 pages!  Even the most naive reader can tell something is up the author's sleeve.  This boring segment has a purpose though; everything that occurs after it, (until the last chapter) is untrue. While some people have been delighted with this over-used plotting technique, I was unimpressed.  To describe a vivid love story resolution, and then to find out it was all made up by another character is over-used, cheap, and manipulative.  It didn't help that in this book it was also obvious as all get-out.  But Briony writing an untrue happy resolution of the love story between her sister and the young man who's life she ruined, seems to be the best \\"atonement\\" we're going to get. She actually has the nerve to muse, \\"How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?\\" WHAT???  She didn't decide an outcome of people's lives, she decided the outcome of her fiction. And her foolish, wrong-headed error becomes unforgivable, because she never asks for forgiveness.<br />I would not classify this amongst the worse books I've ever read but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.  Writing a nice sentence, even one that can be described as \\"lyrical\\" is one thing.  Writing a good book is quite another.bed as \\"lyrical\\" is one thing.  Writing a good book is quite another.
0307387178|2.0|I saw the movie before I read either book about Chris Mccandless. I was moved by the movie, both by Chris' spirit and determination. I did not like this book at all. I felt that the author ridiculed Mccandless' journey, and probably caused a lot of grief for his family, the way he called him ignorant. I really did not like how it was a book that was supposed to be about Mccandless, and more than 3/4 of the bookare about the author's own experiences, and how he feels he's better than Mccandless. It oozed with arrogance, and it angered me that the author had no problem tarnishing the good memories people had of Mccandless. but then the author goes on to brag about his own adventures, and how he was/is better than Mccandless.     I would recommened this book for people who did not like the movie. If you loved the movie like I did, please read the original book. It stays truer than this rag did.

B000KRNCYY|4.0|I saw the concert at Radio City and was truly WOWED by it.  Unfortunately this CD contains mostly soft, quiet songs.  They are great, but it needed more of the electricity of the fiddle, drums, etc.  Both in the concert and on the CD, the use of non-Celtic music was not needed.  There is plenty of ALL Celtic music to handle a concert and CD.
B0006IEVFG|4.0|A very nice, stylish Casio watch.  Good quality, loads of features (like a data bank) and it is solar powered!  Doesn't take much sun to run it at all, after two years the power bar has never gone off full.  The only drawback is the usual one for Casio watches, the hopeless and cheap rubber strap that breaks after 6 months.  Still, that is easily replaced with a nice leather one.  Overall, a very nice everyday watch that won't need batteries changing.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Honestly this review is going to be short, sweet, and to the point.  This is absolutely the collector's edition all Blade Runner fans have been wanting.  George Lucas could learn a thing or three from this collector's edition.<br /><br />The face that it comes in a Voight Kampf case is really an added bonus.  The little chachkis they put in like the unicorn and the spinner are also neat and show off your love and geeky-ness to your office mates nicely.  But what I love the most about the collection (and what George could learn from) is the inclusion of absolutely every version of the movie in existence in addition to the restoration of the film.<br /><br />Ridley Scott clearly knows his audience and fans and even though some of the fans' favorites were his own, he still catered their tastes and their likes and put out all the editions with the same care as he released his final, updated version.  So if you saw the original with narration and love it, it's here for you in beautiful, crisp imagery.  Want to see the European version that you've never seen?  Here as well.<br /><br />The most impressive is possibly Scott's final cut.  Beautifully cleaned up, true to the story, even reshot with one of the original actresses (remember the \\"falling through the glass scene\\" so clearly a double?) to make the movie seamless.  There is virtually nothing to take you out of the movie watching now.<br /><br />I absolutely love it and recommend it to all sci-fi fans as well as all Bladerunner fans.

My cousins and I loved this stuff.    If you don't have a sense of humor, or if you can't stand old movies with dated special effects, don't watch.    And if you're not a fan of the one-liners, get out of here. I think they are damn funny in this movie.
B000QXCOQE|3.0|I'm almost done with this book.  It was very insightful.  What I did not appreciate was the repetitiveness and the bible quotes.  For someone who claims to have studied far and wide, I expected quotes from various texts.  I also don't think it's comprehensive enough.  For example I like the idea that my significant other will go to the ends of the world for me.  He doesn't have to actually do it.  Which of the 5 is that?

B00154GEFU|5.0|Not that I didnt like the ICON albums, they had their gems such as THE GLORY OF WINNING. To me, Steve Howe's guitar makes a huge difference in the sound of PHOENIX and ICON. His playing is up front and beautiful. Geoff Downes keyboards seem to have quite a bit more \\"bite\\" on PHOENIX. Wetton still has the voice of gold and even though he didnt get to \\"cut loose\\" as much as I would've liked, Carl Palmer is still the greatest rock drummer on the planet in my opinion. The melodies on PHOENIX are gorgeous, especially on HEROINE, I WILL REMEMBER YOU, PARALLEL WORLDS, & EXTRAORDINARY LIFE. NEVER AGAIN is a great leadoff rocker. This reunion was way overdue.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Consolers Of The Lonely grows on me with each time I listen to it.  At first there was no sure-fire hit like \\"Steady, As She Goes\\", but this is a solid collection through and through.  Right now \\"The Switch and The Spur\\" is my favorite, with the Western theme, horns, piano, and of course Jack White's guitar.  The title track is a straightforward guitar driven head banger, but others songs like \\"You Don't Understand Me\\" and \\"Old Enough\\", mix it up stylistically and musically, throwing in piano, organ, and violin, as well as the previously mentioned horns.  Unlike other albums that are very front loaded, Consolers does not have any real weak stretches or filler, and the last three songs are just as good if not better than the first three. I could imagine pretty much any song being on someone's favorite list. Quickly becoming one of my favorites of the year, definitely the best rock album so far.

0151013047|5.0|I saw strong parallels between this book and Greene's \\"The Quiet American.\\" Greene's book has done so much to explain the underlying forces behind the American folly in South East Asia of 40 years ago; Hamid's book looks at those forces today which are driving the current American folly in South West Asia. There are the same Ivy League educated elite that are blind to the reality of the world outside their privilege; the same CIA operatives devoted to changing the world into America's likeness. In Greene's case, he used a British character named Fowler to serve as a foil to the CIA operative, Pyle.  Fowler eventually decided that he must act to stop Pyle's \\"agenda.\\" Hamid incorporates this essential conflict into his character, the suitably named Changez, who is transformed from one who believes in those Ivy League economic globalization values, and is an active player in their dissemination, to those of Fowler, who decides that something must be done to stop this juggernaut. Most suitably for a book with heavy overtones of the CIA's involvement in other countries, Changez's change in outlook occurs in Chile, and it is a book seller there, Juan-Bautista, who is the catalyst to this change. I'd love to ask Hamid if he was specifically inspired by Greene, has ever read him, or if all of this is mere coincidence since both Greene and Hamid are describing the same imperial reach.<br /><br />For Americans it is not a flattering description. Greene was banned for a number of years from entering the United States - the immigration authorities never stated a reason, but \\"The Quiet American\\" could be a leading contender.  A number of reviewers of this book clearly wish to dismiss Hamid's insights. He skillfully interweaves them into his narrative, for example: \\"What your fellow countrymen longed for was unclear to me - a time of unquestioned dominance? Of safety? Of moral certainty?\\" (p115) or \\"... much like the short news items on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, which I had recently begun to read. But his tone- with, if you will forgive me, its typically American undercurrent of condescension- struck a negative chord with me...\\" (p55), or \\"... the advancement of a small coterie's concept of American interests in the guise of the fight against terrorism, which was defined to refer only to the organized and politically motivated killing of civilians by killers not wearing the uniforms of soldiers.\\" (p.178).<br /><br />Hamid's book is an essential read for these rich nuggets of observations. It is a vital read for all Americans, particularly those who yearn for that \\"unquestioned dominance\\" of the rest of the world. There are much less exhausting, and more sustainable alternatives.had recently begun to read.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is one of the best exercise DVDs I have owned.  If you have ever seen the punishment that Jillian dishes out on Biggest Loser, then this workout is no exception.  I thought I was in pretty good shape, but I thought I was going to die when I started.  This DVD is a definite thumbs up for someone who is hardcore about getting in shape and up for a challenge.
0440238609|4.0|Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy can hardly be called children's fiction - sure, the main two characters are children, and the book is engaging and exciting enough to keep children's attention, but the conflicts and issues Lyra and Will, the two protagonists, deal with are hardly understandable for children.<br />The trilogy is set in a number of parallel worlds. According to Pullman, there are a million of these, and they overlap and co-exist together in harmony, although they are all quite different from each other. Take Lyra's world, for example. Every person's soul is manifested as an animal, called a daemon, which follows its master around all their life, offering advice and friendship. The books are filled with brilliant ideas like this, but what makes the books so interesting is the fact Pullman tries to explain every single detail through science and philosophy.<br />The main plot line is pretty complicated as Lyra and Will jump from one adventure to another, but for me, the most interesting plot line was the one concerning Lyra's mysterious parents. Her mother, Mrs. Coulter, is an enigma, and possibly the most interesting character in the story. It is also through Lyra's parents how Pullman boldly attacks organized religion, which is one of the biggest messages in the trilogy. Although the story grows weaker as it progresses (\\"The Golden Compass\\" is pitch-perfect, while \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is rather slow and sometimes dull), it works as one eloquent and smart writer's big effort. It's no Harry Potter, but it is definitely worth your time.
0783231032|3.0|Well, I was aware of the movie's genre when I was buying it. But I didn't expect it to be that stupid! Steven Spielberg must be a real genius to put so much idiocy in one movie! Everything is just incredibly exaggerated. Imagine Los Angeles getting laid waste by its citizens just because of fear to be attacked by the Japanese! No, I don't understand that kind of humor. I barely made it to the end. If you decide to watch it, have a good load of beer first.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Great DVD. I have not seen a DVD that is so intense. I am on level one in the first week and you start sweating 2 monutes into the workout. I don't know about the weight loss claim but I have seen muscle defination in my arms.     This really isn't for someone who had knee problems. My knees were aching after the first 3 days.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Amazing storyline and great special effects. Some super unexpected dramatic acting. The main characters stayed true to the series. Loved the behind the scenes footage! Kudos to Joss Whedon - Director, writer, etc...!
B000XTLUW0|4.0|simply put, this is an excellent item for any muse fan, and even for a newcomer. the video/audio quality is great, the song selection is almost perfect, and the performance quality is superb.    the only issue i have is that no where on the package (or in any of the information that i have been able to find) does it say that the dvd only has two audio modes: PCM stereo and DTS 5.1. very few people use DTS decoding when watching DVDs in surround; dolby digital 5.1 is kind of the standard. so why did they do this in DTS? and why is that not stated anywhere?    luckily, most surround receivers can decode both dolby and DTS, but a little warning would have been nice. or maybe have the two different options available separately (like nine inch nails did with \\"and all that could have been\\") or on the DVD.
B000P0J09C|5.0|I'd seen this at the movies. I liked it, but, at the time, not as much as \\"Platoon\\". Remember? There were several Viet Nam movies close together, plus the TV series \\"Tour of Duty\\". After having aged some, I like \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" at least as good, but it's different. I ALWAYS liked the first part - BASIC TRAINING. Now I like the second part - THE BATTLE OF HUE - even more than before. This is a great movie, that explores the personalities and relationships of the different Marines more than some other movies. I also like that the fighting is in a developed area (Hue), because a lot of the fighting wasn't in the jungles, and often that's forgotten. This is on par with \\"Platoon\\" (but different) and way better than \\"Hamburger Hill\\" which was lame.
B0014DFCMS|3.0|Obviously by now everyone has heard the hype surrounding this movie.  Unfortunately, the hype has assisted my lukewarm rating of this movie.  A scant three minutes into the movie and one has to wonder how Diablo Cody won an Oscar for writing such fake dialogue.      The lead character, Juno, is in a pharmacy purchasing a pregnancy test.  Her interaction with the clerk was the stuff you can only find in a movie.  No one talks like they do.  The clerk and Juno both spoke like they were from another planet.  Unfortunately, we're subjected to little more than this type of dialogue for the first two thirds of the movie.  It was as though Diablo Cody watched Quentin Tarantino movies and then decided to try her hand at writing sarcastic, quick-witted banter.  She has a very long way to go.  One-liners don't make for conversation.    I feel that most of the hype about the writing was due to the fact that it was different.  Not that it was really good, but because it is different than typical Hollywood fare.  Different doesn't equal good here.  Nothing is more ridiculous than when, upon being told by Juno that she is pregnant, her father comments that he didn't think the boy who knocked her up \\"had it in him\\".  The ho-hum manner that everyone takes to the situation is very unrealistic and distracts from the story.  No one seems to take the matter seriously.  Not her father, not the boy's family, not the boy, and not Juno herself.      So how did I end up giving this movie three stars rather than one?  Well, the story found its way in the last half hour.  I found Little Miss Sunshine to be like this as well.  Most of the movie was rather dull, but the ending was so good that it made up for the rest.  Juno has a similar quality.  We finally see resemblence of humanity when Juno finds out the perfect couple she chose to adopt her baby aren't the perfect couple she thought they were.  We finally see some realistic interaction between father and daughter.  We see a woman who cannot have her own children distressed over the uncertainty of the adoption process.  You can feel her uneasiness.  After Juno gives birth, her boyfriend visits her in the hospital and there is a real tender scene between them.  Alas we see Juno as a vulnerable child having to deal with the weight of having a baby and giving it up.  I found the final scene to be rather charming as Juno and her boyfriend sit and play guitars and sing a tune together.  It's still unrealistic, but nevertheless it was a nice finish.      There are better movies about intelligent, self-aware, teenage girls who struggle as misfits to find their calling.  One that comes to mind that is better written and superbly executed is Ghost World.  It stars Thora Birtch, Scarlett Johansson, and Steve Buscemi.  The movie isn't for everyone, but if you're interested in a Juno-type movie, Ghost World is far superior.  [[ASIN:B00005T30L Ghost World]]
B00006ADD5|5.0|My review is limited to the quality of the DVD transfer of the single disc version of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". There are other editions of this film (special editions, etc.) but the single disc is a real bargain. The remastering of this film as presented in the single disc version is simply fantastic. Viewed on my 46-inch LCD high definition TV (via a Toshiba HD DVD player), the picture and sound are stunning!  The picture is sharp and clear and the colors are rich and accurate. If your main interest is the film itself (and you can do without all of the extra features found on other DVD editions of this movie)---then the single disc version is a real bargain for this masterpiece.
B000X1H4U0|5.0|Ok, I should take my own advice but read the description. This kit is put together by Cameta, it's not a Canon kit. Even so, it's well thought out and worked well.
0790731940|2.0|My review is limited to the picture and sound quality of the DVD transfer. The movie itself is fine--great cast, very funny--5 stars for the movie, 0 stars for the DVD quality. The transfer of this film to DVD is one of the worst that I have seen! The picture quality is quite poor, very grainy and almost out of focus. It seems that it was copied from a VHS version of the movie. The movie was made in 1994--it's not that old! This otherwise good movie deserves much better treatmenet than this.

B000VR824S|5.0|People talk about sequels not measuring up but that certainly isn't the case here. Clapton has once again managed to put together an amazing collection of artists doing what they do best. Granted I am a Clapton fan, but this isn't about Eric. This is about what he put together. What a treat watching some of the classics like Jeff Beck and John Maclaughlin playing live. And, in case some of you may not have noticed Beck's bass player is absolutely AMAZING....cute too. This is an extremely worthwhile investment if you like good music, not just the blues.
B0009SS00A|2.0|Other books have shown that Dan Brown is capable of of a far better effort than the one to be found in Digital Fortress, a thoroughly disappointing book.  It certainly had the makings of an interesting read but Dan Brown never really rolled them into a coherent whole.  Indeed, Dan Brown gave little indication tht he even tried to do so.    It begins with a fairly promising subject matter and the basics of interesting character development.  Regrettably, beginning is as far as it goes.  The ostensibly intelligent characters prove to be dull and addicted to doing stupid things.  Those stupid things compel clumsy manipulations of the increasingly disjointed plot.      The childish disorder was vexing, almost a threat to serenity.  It was a relief to be done with it.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Again PIXAR makes a winner!  When I first viewed the trailers for this film, I was not all that impressed nor interested in the subject matter.  Not to mention a title I could not pronounce, nor spell correctly if asked.  Once I heard all the good things about this film I decided to give it a try!  I love this movie!  My son is 3 and enjoys this film as well, but I would imagine that older kids would enjoy it more.  A lot of the dialogue I feel would not connect with younger children.  There were so many moments that I found to be hilarious and I love to watch this (with or without my son) over and over again, which is what I feel makes a Disney movie.  The score to his film is great also.    Highly recommended to any Disney/PIXAR lover!

B000003N7Y|4.0|Produced by Bob Thiele on Impulse! Records, 1963's 'Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus' is an interesting little record of some of Mingus's previously recorded tracks combined with a 10 piece band, as well as some new material. Collectors of Mingus material will no doubt recognize some of the tracks here. For instance, \\"Theme for Lester Young\\" is also \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\" on 'Mingus Ah Um', \\"II B.S.\\" is also \\"Haitian Fight Song\\" from 'The Clown', and \\"Hora Decubitus\\" is also \\"E's Flat Ah's Flat Too\\" from 'Blues & Roots'. This does not take away from the sheer brilliance of the recording, though, as Mingus adds a certain amount of soul and feeling to these tracks which I believe has been lacking in the past. The best example here is \\"Hora Decubitus\\" which swings much harder than its predecessor.    The band on this record is made up largely of session musicians as well as some Mingus regulars such as Booker Ervin (tenor sax), Dannie Richmond (drums), and Jaki Byard (piano). The legendary Eric Dolphy also makes contributions on flute and alto sax. On MingusX5, Mingus shows the listener his impressive ability to compose pieces with specific musicians in mind and can turn no-name session guys into legends, albeit just for sixty minutes. Because of such a large ensemble, Mingus adds texture to the music by creating layers of music. There is so much going on, musically speaking on this record, and these are the elements that really set Mingus apart from other jazz greats of the 20th century.    In addition to some of the older material mentioned above, there is also a brilliant cover of Duke Ellington's \\"Mood Indigo\\" as well as a bonus track, \\"Freedom\\" which also appears on the 'Epitaph' record. This is one of those interesting anti-racism Mingus pieces with a vocal track from Charlie himself. \\"Freedom\\" swings so hard, you will unwittingly jump up and dance to the point of embarrassing yourself in front of all your friends! Trumpeters Eddie Preston and Richard Williamsare on fire, and just for this piece alone I would recommend this LP to any casual Mingus fan. It is also a great place to start for someone who is not familiar with any of Mingus's work.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography by David McCullough, \\"John Adams\\" takes an in-depth look at the life of the title character, and his role in the first fifty years of the United States. From his time as a Boston lawyer, to his death on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the life of John Adams and his wife, Abigail, are told with powerful drama and epic sweep.<br />While the story itself is a bit slow at times (the film could definitely have used some additional music than was there), it is overall very powerful, with dramatic renditions of the events that shaped our nation. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney both give brilliant performances as John and Abigail Adams, piercing the soul of these dynamic characters. Tom Wilkinson is fascinating as Benjamin Franklin, while Stephen Dillane does a fine job as Thomas Jefferson. But the best supporting role is David Morse, who is surprisingly effective as George Washington, portraying him with great humility, along with occasional bouts of anger, in a performance that is deserving of an Emmy. Sarah Polley, Rufus Sewell and Danny Huston also give strong performances.<br />\\"John Adams\\" is a remarkable miniseries that sheds light on one of the most fascinating characters of the American Revolution. Historians and non-historians alike will find much to enjoy in this epic look at one of the men who played a large role in the birth of our country.<br />Program/DVD Grade: A

B0000DBJ2B|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all times. This movie is an inspiring example of what can be achieved when the mind is set free of conventional wisdom. An excellent movie for any age group, from toddlers to adults.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is one of the better movies I have seen in a long while.  I bought it from Pay Per View with my cable station and watched it alone , then watched it with my adult son then I went on line and purchased it from Amazon.
B0000549B0|2.0|This is a good, heartwarming film filled with messages about what true living is all about making you question in the end who really is insane and who is sane.  I won't spoil your viewing experience by revealing if Harvey is real or not and hence I'll let you find it out yourself but this film is a good example of a good play very successfully being made into a movie which doesn't always happen e.g. \\"Arsenic and Old Lace\\" which suffered greatly from this treatment.  The film starts out a little slow as it meticulously builds up all the characters but it picks up about 45 minutes through and more than redeems itself by the end.  As the jokes don't age very well, I'd hesitate to call this a comedy for modern day viewers but the term \\"light-hearted\\" is probably the best adjective to describe this overall entertaining film.<br /><br />The problem lies with the DVD which hasn't been restored and so suffers greatly from poor picture quality.  Imperfections and white dots proliferate throughout and the sound quality is also poor.  After about half an hour of viewing, the volume level increases suddenly up to the end.  There are also no Special Features whatsoever as I don't consider the Thearetical Trailer as \\"special\\" and indeed should be expected fare in all dvds anyway.  Fans of this film should wait for a much better restored version to be made first with proper bonus features and at least Dolby Digital Surround Sound options 5.1 with THX DTS as well.  Perhaps with the advent of Blu-Ray, they will take advantage of this opportunity to come up with a DVD that is worthy of this pleasant, heartwarming film with a message relevant even for today's audiences.

B00005JKLZ|5.0|The novel \\"The Time Machine\\" is my favorite book, which I have probably read about 7 times by now.  I was never a fan of the original movie.  While it stays somewhat closer to the story in the novel, the changed parts make it totally ridiculous.  This film, however, changed quite a bit.  The result?  An absolutely fantastic movie!  This film and the novel are so different that they can both be appreciated for the unique qualities in each.  This movie deals with new philosophical issues and opens your mind to new ideas.  Just because it doesn't play out like the novel doesn't mean it's a bad movie.  After all, it's only BASED on the book.  I find this movie an absolute must-have.
0452289963|5.0|I believe that this book is a must have for anyone and everyone! Excellent author who delivers his message very clearly and accurately in this book and will definately change your life (if your open to it of course). This is not another gimmick or self help book, just a book that offers how to live a happier life by just being YOURself. As a mother, this book is even more beneficial, kids have questions all the time about people and different ideas and ways of life, this book helps simplify our egos and choices to word it in a wiser way to my own children when certain life question arise. I'm recommending this book to all my friends and family and loaning my own copy out as well it is so good!

B0013FXWU6|3.0|I thought this movie started slowly, paced itself, then ended amazingly. The whole movie is very long and drawn out and at times the story leaves it difficult to watch. It's not that I have ADD or that I have to watch an action movie with an explosion every two seconds to keep my attention but at times this movie just has a lack of content. I think that sometimes people think that just because a movie has some interesting camera angles, a dark overtone and very little dialogue that makes a movie, \\"deep\\". The one redeeming quality that I found in this movie was the ending which finally tied the whole thing together and made it worth watching. I wish I could explain it better but this might be the type of movie that gets a little better the second time you watch it that is if you can sit through it a second time.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an ordinary Civil Servant. Going about his daily life he hears the voice of an author narrating her new novel. A shrink advises Crick to take prescribed medication but he's convinced he's acting out the novel's main character. The novelist Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is reputed for always killing off her lead character. So Crick is on mission to track her down before it's too late! Eiffel's writing assistant is played by the rap-artist Queen Latifah.<br /><br />Employed by the Inland Revenue, Crick is sent to audit a baker who pays only 78% of her taxes. He instantly falls in love with the baker - the gorgeous but rebellious Anna Pascale (Maggie Gyllenhaal). What begins as a sort of love/hate relationship flourishes over time. Dustin Hoffman excels as ever. Originally he wanted the lead role in this movie but I suspect the directors were reluctant to cast him dating the stunningly cute Gyllenhaal, an actress 40 years his junior! So he has to settle for the eccentric Professor Jules Hilbert instead. He's an important character who helps Crick track down the elusive novelist. It's all very well cast. Even Crick's wristwatch becomes a character in the story!<br /><br />If you're after something a bit different yet not too \\"off the wall\\", check out this film. I for one am very happy to award it the full five stars.

B000YABYLA|4.0|For all those out there who think they've seen everything when it comes to teenage \\"coming of age\\" films I say think again. The recently released DVD `Juno' takes into account all the usual high school dramas one has come to expect from this genre of film but moves swiftly beyond those over explored storylines to catapult the audience into the interior world of Juno (Ellen Page), an attractive but rather \\"different\\" young girl who discovers she's become pregnant by Paulie (Michael Cera) her best friend and secret love of her life.<br /><br />Following Juno on her external journey through personal crisis on the road to adulthood  the viewer is also privy to Juno's internal thought processes thus offering the audience an invitation to establish an intimate relationship with the main character of the film. With such a superb performance by Ellen Page this intimacy is immediate and thoroughly satisfying.<br /><br />`Juno' explores the issues of young love and teenage pregnancy with a clever combination of wit and wisdom, sarcasm and poignancy all delivered within the parameters of one of the quirkiest storylines and cleverest scripts in recent memory. Ellen Page was amazing in the role of the firey but immensely loveable Juno. While the entire cast is wonderful, it's Ellen's performance that will stay with you. If that weren't enough, wait to you hear the incredible soundtrack!<br /><br />My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars-.

It's worthy of a purchase either new or used.
B0010358CQ|4.0|The Good:  The story was really interesting, the idea of a PDA that directly interfaces with the brain being used by a malevolent AI to control people was pretty clever, and though a little predictable, the \\"twist\\" at the end was nicely done. What was also pretty intriguing was the concept of what makes us who we are: Deunan experienced some truly odd feelings when she discovered that her partner, a cyborg named Briareos, had been cloned while laid out in the hospital, and the resulting Bioroid would be her new partner while Briareos was recovering. This new clone looked like and acted like her original partner before he became a cyborg, and he retained some of his knowledge of their relationship. It made for some wonderful moments of WTF. The body animation was motion captured well, and for the most part worked. What was truly amazing was the environment- The art direction and modeling on this show was spectacular, from the city sprawl and it's enormous layout, all the way down to the Landmates and their intricate detailing- utterly mind blowing.    The Bad:  The movie went along pretty smoothly until the end. Unfortunately, the third act played more like a video game than a film, complete with a floating anti-gravity fortress built with the idea of easy access, squad members who are pretty disposable and the neverending stream of bad guys who come out of an undisclosed location. If the staging weren't as good as it was, this stereotypical gamer battle might sink the film. Once again, facial animation was terrible. Also, the cleanup on the hands was pretty weak, making them feel like dead things on the end of their arms. And some of the motion captured animation made the characters jitter in the non-action segments of the piece, most noticeably during Deunans tour of the Bioroid facility and during the party. The general look of the characters was also out of place, a weird hybrid of standard cartoon anime with detailed texture maps. It gave off a vibe that the directors couldn't decide whether they wanted hyper-real or straight up cartoon, and I wish they had made a decision one way or another.    The Summary:  The movie was great. The positives outweigh the negatives enough to make it throughly awesome to watch, and because of the art direction and character development, the movie felt like it was part of a real world. Though I wish they had made some different decisions with regards to animation and the unrealistic boss battle at the end of the film, the story was strong enough to stand on its own.

Half of me thinks it is great that he tried to live independant of the modern world around him and he survived as long as he did. But on the other hand, as intelligent as he was he should have known better then to go in the alaskan wilderness without some basic life saving skills and equipment. it is very well written, although the pictures he took while on his trips would have been great were they included in this book. At this point I still don't know what to think. If he were mentally ill then it would explain things a lot better, but according to the book he wasn't. Maybe at least it will provide others who decide to take on nature to be better prepared.

B000YABYLA|4.0|Without spoilers, the story follows a 9 month journey through an accidental pregnancy of a 16-year old high school student, who ultimately decides to follow her pregnancy to term.<br /><br />The fact that this decision is tied to a negative exchange with a gothic receptionist at an abortion clinic is a tad flimsy, but she nevertheless concedes that she's not ready to assume the responsibilities of motherhood. With this in mind, she finds an appropriately \\"cool\\" older couple interested in adopting, through an ad in a local newspaper.<br /><br />But this is merely the sketch. The real story lies just beneath the surface.<br /><br />The film is fundamentally a celebration of the power of youth. Juno conceives a child that is biologically out of reach to an adopting, older couple. This is further punctuated by her cavalier references to the \\"thing\\" in her stomach, as though it were a new toy in the window of FAO Swartz; something taken for granted by a kid too young to appreciate her station in life.<br /><br />Then the woman's husband discovers a connection [love interest] with Juno he never had with his wife, which is born out of a kind of arrested adolescence, coupled with a wife whose pathological obsession with having a child eclipses her connection with him. Finally, Juno discovers real love [can't tell you where] in spite of her precarious spontaneity, unfiltered insightfulness, and complete lack of boundaries.<br /><br />I found it ironic that the key to the dreams of all the adults rested with a sixteen year old girl. Even her mother's love of dogs was placed on hold until Juno grew up and out of the house [Juno is allergic to \\"dog saliva\\"]. But while this irony is compelling, Juno is one extraordinary teenager...and not in the sense that I'm used to seeing in anyone that age.<br /><br />Her edgy, cavalier and distinctly adult dialog felt more like the hand of the screenwriter, which would place her character in a much older category. I also found the relationship with her parents to be superficial, given the circumstances. The fact that they accepted her pregnancy as a matter of course was a little farfetched, which tended to leave reality in the lurch.<br /><br />In view of this, I allowed my willing suspension of disbelief to flow freely as I enjoyed the solid acting and good story line.<br />In the end, however, I could feel the screenwriter's hand throughout every scene in the film, which left me a tad indignant towards a leading character that was just too far beyond her years.<br /><br />Diablo Cody is the author of the bestseller, Candy Girl.

0451213092|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat from the first 10 pages. This story was unbelievable and knowing that it was a true story made it even better.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|As a longtime SG fan, I had great hopes for The Ark of Truth.  Given the time and anticipated production costs, I expected a film quality version.  But this was more of a glorified TV show - albiet a really good TV show.      Very good premise and story line.  Good special effects as expected.  And it has all the members of the new SG-1.  (Still hoped to see Jack O'Neill make at least a token apprearance.)      So it was very good, but could have been much better.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I knew nothing about this story before seeing it - beautiful and engaging - I simply couldn't stop watching.  A wholesome, enthralling film anyone could enjoy!<br /><br />Update on 6/18/12 - now having read the book as well ([[ASIN:B002RKT6UG North and South]] - a free kindle download), I can say that though the movie definitely takes some liberties, it does in general capture the essence of the book.  They are each enjoyable in their own right.<br /><br />I will say that I have probably watched this well over 10 times since my initial review, which speaks to the quality of the film. I never tire of watching the intricate love story develop. That was one of the things I enjoyed about the book - you could hear their thoughts - which only added a greater depth to the interactions :)
0756404746|5.0|I've been reading Name of the Wind bit by bit over the past few months, enjoying the warm taste of it a little bit at a time right before bed. It is the sort of book that feels like a warm pillow, inviting but comfortable. Today I finished reading the last one hundred pages in a final plunge and now I'm sort of sad that its over.<br /><br />Name of the Wind finds a startling balance between the whimsical fantasy of Harry Potter and the sharp realism of George R.R. Martin. The story manages to avoid Rowling's plot devices and contrived story arcs instead flowing into a story based on realistic outcomes. It is a story that lives on its own, clearly written as it flowed rather than following a pre-determined path. Though it clearly follows George R.R. Martin's interwoven storyline, making no apologies to the way life moves forward, it contains little of the gritty sharp edge that might turn many away from Martin's most excellent series.<br /><br />Name of the Wind breaks the fantasy cliches I hate most. There is no young farmer boy who ends up being a hero of the world. There is no party of adventurers. Each thread of the story doesn't necessarily find a nice neat little knot at the end. Name of the Wind is a book that feels like a man's life. It is relaxed and powerful and wonderful. The language is clean and flows easily, making the 670 page book feel like one much smaller.<br /><br />Name of the Wind is Rothfuss's first published novel and its a powerhouse. I don't exactly remember how it made its way onto my shelf but I'm glad it did. I loved every page and I recommend it highly.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Once again, Jillian comes through with a great workout.  This one has 3 different levels, each more difficult.  You really work hard with this DVD -- it's great!!  I would recommend it to anyone who seriously wants to lose weight and isn't afraid of getting sweaty!
0452289963|1.0|Rich people should read this book, it's not for the middle class.<br /><br />The author has an excerpt \\"become a stone or crystal\\", Mr Tolle is an idiot<br /><br />as he tries to get us to fantasize about becoming unreal objects.
0385751532|5.0|Since reading this book I have bought 5 copies for my 6th grade classroom. This story pulls you into the life of 9 year old Bruno who is unable to understand the life that his family leads. Seeing the Holocaust through his innocent eyes takes the reader on a journey that is riveting. The connection that he forms with Schmuel through the fence and beyond truly speaks to the wisdom of children. When you close the last page, give yourself a few minutes to be with Bruno. Unforgettable!
B00104QSOM|4.0|Despite (or perhaps even because of)the bizarre ending, this is an interesting film featuring a richly deserved Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, who was denied the award previously in an even better role in Martin Scorsese's \\"Gangs of New York\\". The funny thing about Day-Lewis's interpretation of oilman Daniel Plainview is that he's obviously channeling not only John Huston, but Huston as Noah Cross, the debauched L.A. water & power tycoon of Roman Polanski's \\"Chinatown\\"! In fact, if you substitute oil for water,one could almost view this film as a prequel to the 1974 classic. I sadly concur with the other reviewers regarding the dearth of extras on this alleged Special Edition, but still and all, a terrific if sometimes uneven film....
B0013FBS20|5.0|Excellent movie, both alternate endings are good. one for whichever mood you might be in. live or die your choice. excellent quality with blu-ray.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I won't bother with a recap of the story--it's too delicious for that. My mother gave me Jane Eyre, the novel, when I was in middle school and I loved it. I loved the details, the imagery, Jane's inner thoughts, the subtle humor, and, of course, the relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester. One read and Bronte's story embedded itself into my memory. When I heard that BBC did an adaptation of the novel, I had to see it and when I did I fell in love all over again.    This film is gorgeous. The cast is gorgeous. The acting is spot on. This interpretation of a novel is the best I've seen since that of the classic Pride and Prejudice (you know what I'm talking about). It's as faithful as it can be, and the passion between Jane and Rochester is...just awesome. Some may say that some scenes are too modern for 1800s England, but let's be real--these are people, in love, passionate by nature. Can we reasonably expect them to wait to kiss or for Rochester to touch her in some provocative  way until Jane Eyre is Jane Rochester?     The DVD itself is packaged without much fanfare, the main menu is minimal and there isn't that much in way of special features, but the film makes up for that. I do think the Masterpiece Theatre should release these dramatizations like how BBC Video released North and South. It's more eye-catching.
0307383415|1.0|This was one book you can definitely speed read, because there is a lot of fluff within the pages. Does it give you a lot of insight about Barack Obama? Not Really. You do begin to understand where Barack Obama's class warfare comes from especially between the African-American community and the White community. Barack Obama associates with characters that are pessimistic and angry. You also can't help but believe Obama is sucked into this world too.      In one chapter, he talks about change, but he never says what he wants to change, he just wants to change. This narrative of course remains the same. He still talks of change but no one can figure out what he wants to change. He even admits he doesn't know what he is talking about when he says, \\"There wasn't much detail in the idea.\\"      In the chapter he talks of change was during Reagan's tenure. He talks of Reagan, his minions and his dirty deeds. He wants change during a time of great change for the better. Reagan was responsible for creating optimism after the inept Carter years. Obama talks about change in the mood of the country. This period was a very optimistic time in American history. Reagan was responsible for ending the cold war without firing a shot, lowering interest rates from double digits, and creating an unprecedented economic boom.  He also won almost every state in the union. I don't get it. What is it that Obama wanted to change?      When Obama listens to the \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" speech, he sees himself in this world of pessimism and despair. But, Obama's world was nothing like that. Obama never lacked for anything. This is the dichotomy of Obama's world. He lived a life between the privileged and the middle class, and he went to the top universities, but he envisions himself in John Kerry's two America's where he is one of the have-nots scratching his way to the top.    God help us all if Obama becomes the next president.

B000W4KT6E|5.0|The movie musical Hairspray is a wild romp that leaves you with a song on your lips, tapping toes on your feet, and a big, HUGE smile in your heart.  I just wanted to sing and dance along throughout the entire film.  (And, to the consternation and mortification of my children, I DID!!!)<br /><br />The cast commits 250% to their roles, and all have a full out good time, which carries right on through to the audience.  Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, Queen Latifah, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, James Marsden, and Elijah Kelly are all triple threats in this wonderful, feel good film.  The dancing, singing, and acting are all excellent.<br /><br />The heart and soul of this perky film are the simply outstanding production numbers.  The clever choreography is fun and peppy, and the highly enjoyable songs are finger-snapping good (you end up humming them for days).  The pacing is perfect from beginning to end; you are immediately hooked, and they just reel you right in.<br /><br />Overall, this is a happy movie where the girl gets the boy, and everybody sings.  A good, old fashioned musical.  You will be singing and dancing in no time.  What fun!
0670018651|2.0|This book has a couple of interesting chapters in the beginning but the bulk of it is just perfume reviews. I can go online and find thousands of perfume reviews for free by people who love and wear perfume so I don't see the point in paying for the opinions of 1 or 2 people. But I suppose if you want to know what the authors think of your favorite scent you might like this. Although your favorite scent might not even be in the book.
0307265730|5.0|Each of the stories deals with acculturation and relationships, and each stands out as a character study of how people find their way when faced with conflicting values and loyalties. Some of the stories took my breath away, particularly the last 3, which are interwoven.I found myself thinking of these characters long after I finished the book.
B0013FBS20|5.0|A bit slow to start, but this is not your average movie. There are no vampires or superstitions or anything like the movies Hollywood has been putting out. This stands on its own, rooted in science. Though it dosen't keep alot of stuff I wish was in the book (for time reasons obviously), this is a great exciting film. Very sad, very dramatic. 3D was, ok, enviorments were redecliously good (check the behind the scenes). Great story though.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|The sound and visuals are a great improvement over the dvd release. If you are a fan of the movie, worth the upgrade.

B00127RAJY|4.0|If you like Jillian Michaels, then you'll like her newest workout DVD. It's broken down intwo 3 cycles - each one consists of 3 mins of strength, 2 mins of cardio, and 1 min of abs. There are three different levels to advance to as you progress. Each level is only 20 mins long, but you feel like you got a good workout done in a small amount of time. All you need is a set of dumbells. I recommend buying!
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Well I guess the gripe with any \\"hits\\" collection is the songs that are left out. So in typical fashion I'll say this CD is lacking three classics: I Don't Care Anymore, I Missed Again, and Don't Lose That Number. However, I think a PhilPhan needs to at least have the first three solo CDs (Face Value, Hello I Must Be Going, and No Jacket Required) because they are packed with outstanding music and are under-represented on this hits compilation. The great thing about this CD though is it gathers Phil's \\"non-album\\" tracks together so you get the outstanding songs True Colors, Easy Lover, Two Hearts, Groovy Kind of Love, Against All Odds, and Separate Lives. That easily validates the CD and makes it worth owning. Of course missing from this Hits list is one of Phil's biggest songs You'll Be in My Heart because it was made after this best of. But if you're a casual Collins fan looking for one excellent overview album, Phil's Hits is highly recommended; it does contain four of my all time favorites from Phil: Against All Odds, Take Me Home, In the Air Tonight, and Easy Lover.
1400103282|5.0|This was an outstanding autobiography that gave me real insight into Steve Wozniak's life journey and thought process. Most interesting and prevelant was the invention of the first PC, but the book goes beyond that.    As a tech person myself, I really liked how he would stop and describe how things worked as it related to how it shaped his life. Some of it was interesting and easy to understand (e.g., why twisted pair wire is twisted) while others were interesting but mostly went over my head (e.g., the intricacies of a complex circuit board). But I even enjoyed the stuff that went over my head.    Some of the other reviews trashed this book because they thought he was too full of himself or they thought the book was written \\"at a 6th grade level\\". #1 - it's an autobiography - what do you want him to talk about? #2 - he invented the first personal computer - if anything I think he downplays his role too much (it's not like the PC has any impact on modern life, right?). #3 - the book's style is just about perfect if you ask me. If you want an autobiography that reads like a high-brow novel, then read one about a novelist. For me, this was perfectly what an autobiography should be: a behind-the-eyes look at someone truly interesting and impactful on everyone's lives, written in his own words.

The poor honest cop stick is way over done too.<br />This era was a dirty one that hasn't really yet come clean.<br />More or less, you take one dealer down two volunteer in his place and fight over it...

Beah's novel shows the journey that this young man took from being forced to fight in a war that robbed him of his innocence to his ultimate rehabilitation.  It is a must read and should be required reading for high school students.

B000ROALCG|5.0|In an environment of free speech it is expected that someone would say something negative about this album. I must disagree strongly, Marc Anthony shows and shares the wonderful gift that has been given to him.    As they say \\"imitaion is the sincerest form of flattery\\". Somone else said it best when they said that Hector lavoe would be proud of Marc Athony.    This album sounds great, and if you like Lavoe, you will not be let down if you get this cd.

7119005901|5.0|It fits its hype of being one of the four Chinese classics. It takes you back in time and shows the culture, drama, and situation of China around 190 to 220 AD. You will find yourself reading the first chapter and not wanting to stop. The epic book does well by hooking the reader in.       However, there are many characters in which to remember. Luckily the characters themselves, can at many times, be distinguish from each other.    Very good book indeed!
B000YABYLA|2.0|Film focus groups, an abomination, have been around a long time.  This is where creative integrity is swapped out for box office bank-ability, assuming there was any there to begin with.  Various different endings and permutations of all types are tried out on a small handful of people in the dark.  Then, movies are trimmed and tailored to suit their tastes.  (Originality stands little chance.)  Well, apparently there are now Sundance focus groups.  How else could one explain the popularity of Juno, a movie whose sole purpose in life seems to be pleasing the smug, self-consciously hip judges at that increasingly less independent film festival.<br /><br />In this case affixing blame is easy, it belongs in its entirety to Diablo Cody who wrote the screenplay.  In the history of film has there ever been a character as improbable as Juno MacGuff?  Has there ever been a story more stupid, or confused about what it wants to say?  Juno begins as a surly, edgy, dark outcast and ends up just shy of the yearbook committee.  Her glib, sarcastic persona must have seemed delicious to those cool cats at Sundance, but the way adults buy into her dismissive attitude is preposterous.  Only the ultrasound technician, (Kaaren de Ziva), speaks to her and her ilk as they should be addressed, irresponsible and vulgar children.  The inevitable 3rd act reconciliations, emotional growth spurts, and newfound harmonies are beyond hokey and facile, and as for Paulie, the boyfriend she now loves, I have encountered loaves of Wonderbread with more personality.  We are supposed to buy that she has anything in common with him?<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman and a wonderful cast are to be heartily congratulated for transforming this three-legged duckbilled platypus into something resembling a movie.  Ellen Page really is remarkable as Juno; she takes a character more ludicrous than Batman and makes her seem real.  Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons, two reliable veterans, are extremely good as mom and dad.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are just acceptable as the prospective adopters.  I don't know if Michael Cera, Paulie, is good or not.  If he was intended to be completely vapid, uninteresting, and unattractive, then perhaps he's good.<br /><br />If you have any doubts about how bad this movie actually is, watch Little Miss Sunshine again.  Both films want to hit the same marks, Sunshine hits them, Juno self-consciously attempts to hit them.  It's like watching a couple dance; except they're following the footprints in an Arthur Murray Dance Studio.  Speaking of which, beware of the score featuring songs by Kimya Dawson.  Never has so much precious, pretentious, cutesy-poo teenage angst been packed into such a short amount of time - unbearable.er Garner and Jason Bateman are just acceptable as the prospective adopters.

B000UJ48U4|5.0|This is a must have DVD for any Stanley Kubrick fan- his last direction. This film delves into the mystery of the social elite in America and their perverted, yet self-accepted rituals. Kubrick reveals more than Nicole kidman's body in this compelling documentary-type drama.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|It's a great idea of Mike to try classical music. It's mature and melodic, complex and powerful. It's one piece from beginning to end. He successfully uses the full instrumentation which gives it a richness.  He uses silent parts and more powerful peaks in a very appropriate sensitive way.  If this is Mike's last music ever (me mentioned he may retire), what a phantastic ending! He has created a timeless piece of music.
B000063UR2|5.0|This was the first Ridely Scott film that I am familiar with and a must have for any Scott or Tom Cruise fan. To Say Tom Cruise is a misnomer, rather Tommy Cruise would be more appropriate. Beautiful, mystical scenes, absolute romantic chemistry between Cruise and Mia Sara, this film needs to be viewed and enjoyed with a \\"special\\" someone. A brillinat mix of fantasy and romantacism. I love it. Satan has never been better protrayed than in this film!!!

B0013FXWU6|2.0|It started out with a bang and I was so enthralled.  But Day-Lewis' character really bored me in the end. And the story too. Lewis's character was so odd and one-dimensional.  And frankly, I don't understand why he won Best Actor?!  It was like he was re-playing the bloody, violent, wild-eyed part from GANGS OF NEW YORK and I was disappointed.  Doesn't he play anything else?  Is that all that interests him in a role?  OK this one he has a kid, or an adopted kid, and that opens up possiblities. But honestly for such a reknowned actor I'd think he could find some more variety in his roles. C'est la vie, it's his choice of course.

B000U0F7RG|4.0|First up, let me state that I'm a guy. So I'm the least likely person to be caught watching Gilmore Girls. I actually classify it as a guilty pleasure because I definitely don't fit the demographic this show is aiming for. So what makes this show so appealing? It's the wit, humor and intelligence that peppers every episode. Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore) has can veer from comedic slapstick to deadly serious drama without batting an eyelash. The only other actress I've seen do it is Alison Janney (from The West Wing).     The secondary characters (and actors) like Luke, Sookie and Michel are also what make this show so memorable. They are so well written and performed, and have such intelligence and depth to them. Coming from an Asian migrant family I can definitely deeply empathize with Lane Kim. And I was very much like Paris when I was younger, only I didn't have her formidable intellect.    I think the show suffers quite a bit from the Sherman-Palladino's departure in the Seventh season. However, full credit to the remaining cast and crew members for following Amy Sherman-Palladino's vision to its natural conclusion, and giving the show the send-off it deserved.    My only very minor dissapointment with this Boxset is that there aren't as many special features per season, when compared to other shows like Buffy The Vampire Slayer or The West Wing. There is only one commentary from Amy and Daniel Sherman-Palladino (on \\"I Jump, You Jump Jack\\").     The West Wing. Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Babylon 5. Gilmore Girls. Amy Sherman-Palladino joins Joss Whedon and Aaron Sorkin on my list of favourite writers in any medium.
B000001FI7|5.0|What can be said that already hasn't been said? I don't think there's much. This must have REALLY seemed ground-breaking at the time: Backbeats that sometimes recall hip-hop elements and some real soaring, soulful vocals from Beth Gibbons. There's not a single bad song on here, and it's most famous for the awesome \\"Sour Times,\\" which sounds at times like a James Bond theme with certain elements. Then there's \\"Numb\\" which is probably my favorite song on the album, real soulful vocals there. You get more blues-rockin' moments like on the record's closer \\"Glory Box.\\" There's occasional samples which rule and sound neat like everything else. If you haven't heard \\"Dummy\\" yet you are in for a real treat. Pretty much everyone who owns it can tell you that it's well worth the hype. It is beautiful and proves electronic music CAN BE full of emotion. Even today, it doesn't sound dated at all. I like the follow-up album too, but advise this as your start.
B0010X745K|2.0|You all know by now, I tell it like it is. And here's how it is with this movie: half good, half bad.  That sums it up neatly.    The first half is a tightly paced, suspenseful thriller.  Expertly executed, I was fully engrossed for the first hour or so.      But then, whoa nelly!  What happened?  Pretension crept in, and suddenly we're watching something that the filmmakers obviously considered more \\"important\\" than a monster movie.  And I'm sure many would agree with me - the second half is ultimately more important than the first half.  A great pay-off can compensate for an uneven start.  But a killer start isn't going to really look so good after a soggy, half-baked conclusion.    I don't want to spoil anything.  The movie is fun enough, and worth a rental.  But suffice it to say that when it was over I started thinking of all the movies this one cribbed bits and pieces from.  Let's see, \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" (and the other Romero 'Dead' films, for that matter), \\"The Fog\\", \\"Tremors\\", and about at least a hundred others.    As a God-fearing Christian, I took minor offense to the old lady character who preached throughout the movie about how all the scary events taking place signaled the end of days.  We're not all like her and I'm frankly tired of seeing good Christians portrayed in such a bad way.  Peace be with you.
B000YD7S26|4.0|To mark the 100th anniversary of Herbert von Karajan Deutsche Grammophon continues the exploration of its video catalogue and unearthing these remarkable Bruckner concerts from 1978/79 with the Wiener Philharmoniker is a more than welcome event. What I find amazing about these filmed documents is that they disprove more than anything the complaints often laid against Karajan as the inhuman control freak.  Here is a conductor, in the autumn of his career, entirely on top of his game, serving as the most dedicated guide through these fascinating works, obtaining magnificent results from one of the finest orchestras of the day. Karajan knows as none else to blend sense of architecture with orchestral detail and transparency. His Bruckner may not always be the most mysterious (compared to Eugen Jochum, for example) but for all his mastery of structure, these readings preserve a degree of spontaneity, warmth and glow, humanity even, undoubtedly linked to some extent to performing live. This is best realised in the 9th symphony, where Karajan's unerring sense of pace really drives the listener toward the abyss. The playing of the Wiener Philharmoniker is in this respect nothing short of outstanding. It's perhaps not so much about orchestral precision (although very little really dramatic here either, considering these are live concerts) but about colour, transparency (the strings are sublime), sweep, and dynamics. The moments of silence are as powerfully gripping as the tutti. The \\"Te Deum\\" is also a first-rate performance, reminding us in Karajan's dealing with the Wiener Singverein, what a great opera conductor he was.     The main drawback of this issue, however (and for a release under Karajan's artistic supervision this is quite exceptional), is the visual quality of the films. Taped in 1978/79 in the Musikverein in Vienna and in the St Florian Stifstkirche near Linz (so to speak Bruckner's temple) they sadly show their age, quite unlike the earlier Karajan/BerlinerTchaikovsky and Brahms Symphonies also on DG, which were captured on 35mm film. These Bruckner concerts suffer from poor colour definition and contrast, while the 9th and the \\"Te Deum\\" shot at the Musikverein, are much too dark. The camerawork is generally also a lot more conventional than in the other often visually stunning Karajan concerts. Fortunately, the sound is fine, without being exceptional, but the sheer beauty of the orchestra can be appreciated.    Performance-wise this a five star release, but since we are considering DVD's which also have to be seen, I need to give it a four.
377571622X|5.0|The book is fantastic! However to my horror it was packed very badly and the book arrived scratched and a damaged. Amazon expects me to pay for all shipping costs to get a refund of the book value only. Since I live in Australia the return shipping would surpass the value of the books sent. I emailed Amazon with this issue 2 weeks ago and NO REPLY!       DO NOT BUY FINE ART BOOKS FROM AMAZON!!

B000BB1MI2|2.0|Of that Wonka bar! Holla, my peepenheimers - I finally gave into my curiousity and watched the new \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" directed by the highly overrated Tim Burton and the almost equally overrated Johnny Depp.  PUH-LEASE!!    Look, I will not disguise my absolute unabashedly love for the original classic masterpiece [[ASIN:B0009FGWLW Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Special Edition)]]. Gene Wilder is pure genious as Mr. Wonka, in a performance that simply cannot be repeated, bettered, or even equalled.  Depp was foolishly ill-prepared to try.  Whereas Wilder invested a truly menacing, disturbing side to Wonka, Depp makes him simply 'kinda weird'.  Thumbs (and gobstoppers) down to him.    Much is always celebrated about Tim Burton's visual and overall atmosphere created in his movies.  Yeah, he is a capable visual stylist.  But it matters very little when he doesn't do anything else right!  I'm not saying he never has (I loved [[ASIN:6302477751 Frankenweenie]]). But more often enough he just comes across like a dork.    I liked Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompa's (and he was also the film's narrator).  But I thought the new Charlie was too goody-goody and he embarrassed his grandpa.  After his Grandpa was happy about being able to go to the factory, Charlie was all \\"Oh but I should sell the ticket to help the family\\" and made his Grandpa look like a big jerk.  There is a limit to how \\"helpful\\" a child should be.  Talk about a killjoy.  The actor playing the Grandpa is utterly delightful!  Best performance in the film.    I didn't like the kids as much as in the original. I don't mean the young actors themselves, heavens no. I think Burton gave them one direction, something along the lines of: \\"Oh, you've all seen the original movie, right? Cool, just act like that.\\"  I don't blame them.  Some of them talented, especially Anna Sofia Robb who shined in [[ASIN:B0009NZ2KG Because of Winn-Dixie]].  But I don't know why they used a digital fake forAgustus Gloop instead of a real boy!
B0010YSD7M|4.0|While it must be said that I did see the pre-release online version that was floating around, I am quite glad that my sister bought this one for me after it came out.    I wasn't exactly disappointed with this (obviously it gained 4 stars) but I found myself saying \\"WTF?\\" a few times.  The stupidity of some Tauri is just too great to ignore.  ... As well as Teal'c's amazing ability to walk extreme distances after getting shot in the back.    I wasn't real happy with how they got rid of the Ori, it seemed like a cop-out to me, but that's my personal opinion and you can feel free to disagree with me.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This was presented first as a tv show and I couldn't wait until the next show came on. This video lets it all go into a wonderful story. You can't find any better actors, and these guys are tried and true. If you like action, a good story and want to be throughly entertained, this the video for you. Follows the book very well.  Jim Muratet
B00000DGUY|3.0|This is a good collection of the bands biggest hits, but I simply LOVE the mellow, moody atmosphere and guitar playing on the very first Dire Straits album.  I recommend you buy THAT album before this one.  You'll thank me, I guarantee it!!  Talk about an album you'll want to play on a hot summer night!  I truly believe if you like the song \\"Sultans of Swing\\" you will love the rest of the songs on the debut.  The rest of the album maintains the same kind of vibe.  The high quality of the songwriting mixed with a great rhythm section is another highlight.  Just... awesome!  Skip this Very Best Of collection.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Very good product and in my opinion great value as well.  The quality of these videos is amazing as is the footage.  And with 550min of video it will keep you satisfied for a while.  The only thing I wish it had was more!
0618918248|1.0|I just saw the movie Expelled yesterday and Ben Stein interviewed Richard Dawkins that author Richard looked like a idiot. Watch Expelled first and you will not buy a book written by this dork.
B0007WYFHU|2.0|It sort of started OK and then I was skip reading just to find out what happens with the twins. If I wasn't so interested in the ''incest'' factor I would have left it all together. The book goes back and forth - present to past and back so many times - and that gets really annoying and you sort of figure everything out even before it's been said.   The writing is a little annoying too - I can sort of see why it may be considered ''artistic'' but the whole thing kinda left me feeling that the award was given to the writer because she is an Indian writing about an Indian family, so it seems ''authentic''. Not fair! This book certainly doesn't deserve it.  It was - mildly put - boring!    And yes - what was the point of this story?
B0010X745K|2.0|I am a King fan and have enjoyed most of the King movie adaptations I've seen, but this movie is so dark and bleak from beginning to end.  I like horror best when it is suggested on screen, I don't like gore and this movie had more than enough of it to suit my tastes.  The creatures resembled the monsters in Cloverfield (another film with little redeeming value), and seemed a bit on the fake side to me.  The trapped towns people were so stupid and arrogant that there were a few I would have loved to feed to the monsters myself.  There were a lot of tired horror cliche's in this film, I don't think it had much new to offer.<br /><br />What I disliked the most about the film was the disturbing twist ending.  At heart I want the good guys to win out in the end, and evil to be defeated.  It was obvious that King was going for shock value, but I would have perferred a happier outcome.  There was one bright spot in the end, but I won't reveal it since it would be a spoiler.  In plenty of other King films we have the satisfaction of seeing the good guy win, but not this one.  Since I've never read the original story I can't comment on whether the film was true to it or not, perhaps Mr.King isn't really to blame.<br /><br />Stephen King Movies I have liked:  Rose Red, The Shinning TV Miniseries, Misery, Desperation, Sometimes They Come Back, Pet Cemetary, and It.
B00005QEO1|5.0|The biggest album of Aerosmith's career?  Well, some will argue Toys in the Attic was, but this album was more popular when it was first released because of the \\"big comeback\\" tag that was attached to it by many fans and disc jockeys.  And how can I have a problem with that?  The band had a severe drug addiction, and they were able to beat that dreadful addiction and make a quality album.    All the big hits from the album that you've heard (plenty of times) are gold, but even the lesser known songs are quite strong, melodically.  Steven Tyler's singing is right on the money most of the time, and this album avoids being dominated with all kinds of stinky ballads the band would start making a couple years after this albums release.  Worth picking up.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|I attended this concert in Pittsburgh and was somewhat disappointed with that show.  I admit I am a Gabriel fan- hence enjoy the older stuff.  While the production was top notch at this show, the sound quality was horrible.  I think they spent too much on lighting and not enough on sound, and I was in front of the soundboard.  I also think Phils actions on stage were lame and took away from the momentum or energy by taking five minutes to point to different sections of the arena.    Having said that, I bought this set and was not disappointed at all.  The sound quality is by far one of the best live recordings I have ever heard.  Few bands are able to record a live show with decent sound (e.g. Pink Floyd or Roger Waters probably have some of the best live recordings soundwise).  Every instrument is perfectly balanced, to this day I am amazed on how good this recording can sound.  Highlights for me include In the Cage, Firth of Fifth, Mama, Los Endos, and Carpet Crawlers.     You do not hear Phil doing his lame act, just a good overview of their career.  One can debate setlists and how other songs should have been included or the way they were arranged (which is fair), but I will stick to what they do give you- two discs of perfectly recorded music.    While I am not a fan of many songs including Hold On My Heart, Follow You, and esp. Invisible Touch and I Can't Dance, the few gems and the perfection of the recording make this a must have for the price- a great value for two discs.    Now a note of caution.  The Taurus Pedals on this recording hit subsonic lows.  I do not have a good stereo in my vehicle, and these ultra low notes will distort the music.  I noticed this on Los Endos more than any other song.  If you have a good home stereo, it honestly feels like an earthquake at high volumes.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Many people have already talked about what this movie is about, so I won't repeat that here.  I've loved and owned this movie since it first came out (on VHS LOL).  Finally wore the VHS out, and was ecstatic when I saw it was on DVD.  I've watched it several times since getting it.  It's a fun movie, with great characters, and a fun storyline.
0810994739|5.0|Proof the formula works twice, look out Grisham. Another referral from my son and another enjoyable, and at times, hilarious recounting of MY middle school years. And I thought writing my name on a table with an alcohol burner was funny.<br /><br />You forty-somethings out there put down your tired Grisham, cheesy Cussler, or old, but good Clancey and read this. It's only a night and you will enjoy it. And you might even develop an additonal bond with YOUR son or daughter: priceless.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is one of the most original movies i have ever seen.... this movie is so funny and so real feeling... i was one of those ppl that thought that it was not all it was cracked up to be... i was completley wrong...     Juno really caught my attention with the smart jokes and its spunk... Ellen Page definatley should have won an oscar for this movie. her performance was just AMAZING!!!! Jason Bateman, j.k. simmons, and jennifer garner give excellent performances as well.... the only thing is i wish they put my boy michael cera more in this film...    i definatley recommend this movie to anyone that loves a comedy with great performances and a storyline everyone could relate to...    5 stars out of 5: im so glad this movie won an oscar!!!

Highly recommended
B0012YYZYU|2.0|OK, so the songs are the same but I was disappointed in the HD DVD. I got to see Zepplin in concert at about the same time this concert was recorded and have listened to cds ever since. Sound quality wasn't that good neither was picture quality. I think the stuff in the beginning of the dvd just really confused me and I couldn't get into it that much from then on.
B00005JPTK|3.0|Will smith has done it again.... another great performance... i dont kno anyone else that could play this role but Will... I AM LEGEND is a good movie... not great... i think the problem is that there was not anyone in this movie... just Will.     this movie was on the edge of your seat at some points (my favourite part was when he saw \\"Fred\\" in the street)... the zombies were kinda cool too... and the back story right before the infection got out of control was really interesting for the story as well.    The original ending was REALLY GOOD!!!! on the special edition with the alternate ending was kinda weak and didnt seem right... you just gotta see it for yourselves if you havent watched it...    Mr. Smith has another hit under his belt and i alwayz look forward in seeing him in films. I AM LEGEND is a decent movie and most will find it entertaining.... i did.    3 out of 5 stars
B000TEUSJA|3.0|The R rating means that the fifty four minutes or so of hardcore is nowhere to be found so nothing can distract you from the film's choppy editing. Scenes jump ahead so abruptly and frequently that it's impossible to be sure what  the hell is going on. This makes a mess of a movie even messier.  With that being said, 'Caligula' is one of the more interesting failures in cinema of the past forty years. The script was written by Gore Vidal but he demanded his name be removed. I'm sure it was historically accurate at depicting the perverse sex and violence rampant in Rome at the time but pornographer Bob Guccione goes overboard  making things more raw and in your face than is appropriate or tolerable. The cast, a who's who of top British talent had no idea that Guccione was going to bastardize the film. Malcolm McDowell is a natural for Caligula since he engages in the same kinds of ultra violence as he did in 'A Clockwork Orange', Helen Mirren is extremely sexy as his wife Caesonia, Peter O' Toole is debauched perfection as Caligula's Uncle Caesar, and  John Gielgud is the psychic Nerva. All of them invest their roles with everything they have but none of them could foresee where this film was headed.'Caligula' the movie is  famous for attempting to be the first Hollywood movie with hardcore mixed throughout. No one talks about the acting, just the sex. It's too bad since the acting is decent. Fortunately for Gielgud and O'Toole their embarrassment is short lived since neither actor makes it past the first half hour. Caligula will do whatever it takes to assume power and this means killing as many people as it takes, including his uncle. After he inherits the throne his next order of business is to find a wife who will produce him an heir.  Caligula isn't too interested in finding a mate since he enjoys sleeping with his sister (Teresa Ann Savoy) too much. He finds a way around this by having a threesome with both women (glimpsed briefly in the trailer). Caligula goesmad with his new power and begins assassinating anyone who opposes him, and raping the wives of his soldiers whom he has sent away on false military campaigns. He anoints himself a God and decides the logical way to eliminate Rome's debt is to force senator's wives into prostitution. He builds an Imperial Brothel where the commoners can come and sleep with his trusted adviser's wives. The set for the Brothel is as outrageous as the concept. A giant ship complete with Roman soldiers as rowers serves as the pleasure palace. This scene is a perfect example of the outrageous grandiosity and extravagant spending that this film degenerated into. This edited version can't come close to telling the full story and shocking you as much as the unrated version but it's kinda fun to see the sets and costumes and laugh at how absurd it all is. Working from a good script and full of great actors this film turned into a legendary bomb that is worth checking out to see what all the fuss was about.
B00005JKHP|1.0|Take an original Star Trek episode and draw it out to three times the usual length, take away the humor, throw in some post-Star wars special effects, and finally add in some uninteresting new characters, and there you have it \\"Star Trek - The Motion Picture\\".<br />Admittedly there is some initial fun in seeing the old crew back after a ten year hiatus but this fun drains away pretty quickly. Long, boring and colorless - right down to the drab production design - even fans will struggle to sit through this one. You get the feeling that director Robert Wise was so conscious of being respectful of the material that he ended up embalming it. If this review is not warning enough, this film has been recut twice all to no avail.
B0013FBS20|4.0|I thought this movie was excellent.  Although the alternate ending on the disc was much better than the theatrical version in my opinion.  I also enjoyed watching the extras/behind the scenes on this disc which sometimes I really don't take the time to do so.  It was interesting to see how this was filmed in NYC, and the scenery in the movie was accurate with the TLC/Discovery show \\"Life After People\\".
B000W4KT64|5.0|This is one of the few movies that was just as good as the original. I have both in my collection. John Travolta was a hoot in this movie
0143038419|5.0|This is the most enjoyable book I have read in a long time.  Elizabeth Gilbert writes in a flowing, descriptive and amusing style.  I found myself even laughing outloud at times! Her story is inspiratonal and her writing is superb.  I was sorry to reach the end of this book ! I recommend it to all who enjoy travel, personal growth and adventure.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|Great Show with one of the greatest moments in wrestlemania history...    John Cena vs. Big Show (US Title Match)    pretty good match with a heck of a finish. 6/10    RVD and Booker T vs Cade and Jindrak vs The Dudley Boyz vs La Resistance (World Tag Title Match)    another pretty good match...RVD and booker put on another great performance.  6/10    Christian vs Chris Jericho    a very solid match that told a really good story with a good twist for an ending.  7.5/10    Evolution vs Rock N'Sock Connection    A good match with entertaining spots from flair and the rock, typical mick foley stuff, some real power from batista, and a really good showing for orton.  7.5/10    Torrie and Sable vs Keibler and Jackie    Nothing other than filler.    Cruiserweight Open Match    Really good showing. Only problem was it was too short. But great showings by Mysterio, Noble, Dragon, Kidman and Chavo and solid stuff from everyone else.  7/10    Goldberg vs Lesnar (Austin as Special Guest Referee)    Terrible, terrible match. Neither one seemed really interested in the match seeing as it was both of their lasts. Even Austin couldn't save it. 2/10    Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs The APA vs The Bashams vs The World's Greatest Tag Team    Solid Match, nothing spectacular. Kinda dumb stipulations with the tags and all but a decent match nonetheless.  Would've liked to see Farooq get in there but it was cool without him.  5.5/10    Victoria vs Molly Holly (Women's Championship vs Hair Match)    Really good showing by both women. Not either of their best work but good nonetheless. 6.5/10    Eddie Guerrero vs Kurt Angle (WWE Championship Match)    A GREAT match. I'm a huge fan of Eddie's and this was one of my favorite matches of his with a great ending that plays to Eddie's gimmick. Awesome match. 9.5/10    Kane vs Undertaker    Glorified squash match, but still rather entertaining. Best part was taker's entrance. It was great to see and hear Paul Bearer again. Brought back LOTS of memories. 6/10 (More for the entertainment and entrances {Kane's was a sight too} than the match itself)    Triple H vs Chris Benoit vs Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Title Match)    Awesome match that got pretty brutal at points and had lots of back and forth action. up there w/ taker, angle and rock at vengeance 02 as one of the best triple threat matches ever. 9/10    Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero in the ring at the end. One of the greatest Wrestlemania moments in history.  Overall really good.  The crowd was awesome, but then again MSG crowds always are. The crowd gave almost every match that wrestlemania feel to it, especially in the benoit and goldberg matches. the crowd was AMAZING during those 2. but overall a very solid wrestlemania.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|I love this movie! It's witty as well as sensitive. Something I have always wanted to do was to go to Europe to find the history of my family roots. Everything is Illuminated inspires me even more.   The story of the young \\"American\\" played by Elijah Wood who goes to search for his family roots is very touching. He encounters the cultural differences as well as the religious ones. His journey is just that...a journey that reveals not only the truth he is searching for but also the depth of discrimination towards different faiths.  The movie title is also revealed in the story. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an enjoyable movie to watch for a couple of hours or over and over again.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie at the cinemas and just had to buy it when it was released. Michael Moore is an excellent director and I never knew health care was so bad in major countries like the US

0385338724|2.0|As a HUGE Shopaholic fan, I have to say I was pretty disappointed in this book. Even though it's not one of the hilarious Shopaholic series, I still expected it to be funny and it really wasn't. Will look forward to her next book and hopefully that one will be better!
B000P0J09C|5.0|This movie has been described enough to leave that part out. What has not been stated is the power of the film considered in the context in which it was created. I fear that many of the reviewers who agree that the movie is over the top in some way or unrealistic or flawed have not read much in the way of Viet Nam war history. Even if you discount the fact that Michael Herr (author of Dispatches) and Gustav Hasford (author of The Short Timers) helped Kubrik write the screenplay(!!), you can read any of a number of histories on the war and read similar testimonies.<br /><br />This movie's power lies in the realistic portrayal of what it meant to be a Marine in Viet Nam.  All the horror, some of the dark humor produced, and the true human behavioral ambiguity of surviving a war zone. These were some of the bravest men alive, also some of the scariest, some of the funniest, and some of the craziest. This movie and Kubrik's talent lies in the representation of the men that reveals the training that created them, and then how that translates into real war actions. None of this is to detract from the power of Platoon or Apocolypse Now - also superb movies - but to make sure the fact is known that Full Metal Jacket is equal to their power... actually, if you are a Viet Nam war history scholar as I am, you should have all three for an acurate trifecta of experience!<br /><br />If you watch the movie - and chat with a few Viet Nam Marine vets - and still do not feel convinced for some reason that this movie is brilliant, check out these great books:<br /><br />Dispatches - Michael Herr<br />The Short Timers - Gustav Hasford<br />Patriots - Christian G.

B0010ZR160|3.0|\\"Gone, Baby, Gone\\" is a film with great potential that somehow fails to deliver.  It is a \\"whodunit\\" that, in the end, lapses into implausibility.  Only the most credulous viewer could believe all the twists and turns of the plot.<br /><br />The essence of the story involves the abduction of a small girl who was left unattended while the mother went to a bar.  Apparently, this was not an isolated occasion.  The mother is a heavy drinker and drug taker who mixes with bad company.  Often, the child is left to her own devices.<br /><br />My criticism of the film hinges on the implausible aspects of the plot.  The film makers would have us believe that a high level conspiracy can exist within the Boston Police Department.  Indeed, the conspiracy involves the covering up of child abduction and the resort to near vigilante tactics.  Perhaps I have said too much and given away some aspects of the plot.  This may be so but it is not entirely so.  I am sure most viewers will not \\"click\\" to the story until near its end.  Regardless, a cleverly contrived plot should not allow a story line that, upon reflection, is simply not believable.<br /><br />Before I finish, I have one further criticism.  The starring role is played by Casey Afleck.  He performs well except for one point.  Namely, his dialogue often descends to mumbling. Is it just me?  I suspect not.  If viewers have trouble comprehending dialogue from the lead player, then the film has problems.

B0014CQNTK|5.0|Great movie, and I think it is very realistic to current american society. Everything from the slang to the dress in the movie gives it the feel of real america, and faces a very real issue of teenage pregnancy. The humor was also great, and the puppy love story between juno and paulie is adorable.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|Well, it seems that most artists find a niche and can't move out of it. Thank god for that, then! This is just a liiiiiitle bit different than System Of A Down's last offerings and in a lot of ways similar. And again, thank god for that too, because waiting several years (or more) to another \\"mezmerizing\\" or \\"hypnotizing\\" project by SOAD would be too much...    This CD is well worth buying because there is not a weak song on the album and quite a few gems...

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I grew up on Godzilla movies of the 60s and 70s and I have always enjoyed movies like this. I was also someone who followed Cloverfield's viral marketing campaign being caught up in the excitement which the first teaser trailer delivered. Although I have a few complaints about a couple aspects of the movie; for me the movie more than lived up to the hype and JJ Abrams and Matt Reeves delivered a movie that was a terrifying thrill ride.<br /><br />I understand that the way the movie was filmed was a deal breaker for some people. For me there were times when I did think the shakiness was a bit too much but for the majority of the film the camera technique faded into the background and I was able to enjoy the movie. Being a lover of giant creature features the other slight disappointment was in the length of time the monster was seen in the movie. I say it's a slight disappointment because I do think that seeing only glimpses of the monster throughout the movie did help create that sense of fear of the unknown and the suspense of what may happen at any minute. But I don't think showing the monster a little more than they did would not have hurt. Also a consolation is the fact that creature designer Neville Paige designed a giant monster that was frightening, very original and innovative.<br /><br />Much has been said about the plot so I will not rehash it here. I did like the acting and the time in the beginning of the movie getting to know our characters was well spent. For me they were characters which I grew to care about. TJ Miller's character of Hud and his unrequited crush on Marlena provides for some humorous moments of comic relief throughout the film. But the main relationship driving the plot of the movie is Rob who finds the courage to face a monster head on in his pursuit to rescue Beth the girl he's afraid to commit to. All in all Cloverfield is a fun, thrilling and entertaining  movie that hopefully has brought a sense of real fright and terror to a genre of films that had long since lost its ability to frighten.had long since lost its ability to frighten.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|While I am still sulking over SciFi's cancellation of Stargate-SG1, I thought this was a great movie for cleaning up the loose ends. If you love the Stargate-SG1 characters, this is a must see to finish off the series!
B0013FXWU6|2.0|There's lots of good, entertaining reviews already.  I'll just add my opinion that the best thing about this movie was the very interesting and accurate look at the technology and methodology of drilling for oil in the early days. This part of the movie was masterfully done!    But much of the rest of it was simply inaccurate, and it looked it.  Beginning with the idea that this was supposed to be set in California.  I've been all over California and none of what I saw looked like the countryside in this movie. *** I've edited this to say that I'm wrong in having said that this didn't look like California. Californians have commented that some parts of the state do. After researching it, large parts of this movie were, in fact, filmed in California, but significant portions of it was filmed in the Marfa, Texas, area which is indeed close to the Permian Basin oil fields. ***    Caricatures and stereotypes... the vicious, insanely-bad, blood-thirsty oil man, and, the devious, deceiving, self-interested evangelist preacher. Oh, yes, two evil icons of our time, excoriated in this propped-up farce for the audience to share vicarious thrills of condemnation for?  No, this part of the movie was lethally wrong, and the word, \\"Overkill\\" comes to mind....  Are there crooked, hypocritical preachers and psychopathic, manipulating oil men?  Yes, but not as bad as this, frankly. As portrayed, it seems almost as ridiculous as both Godzilla and Mothra running amok in Tokyo at the same time. It ruins what might have been an interesting story by turning it into a cloying, overdone \\"morality play\\".     Maybe if it had been portrayed instead as just a very, very long dream sequence it would have been more believable, and, made more sense.
0316743003|2.0|This book is very much of its time, and has to be regarded as such.  I was forced to read this for work by an over zealous client.  I gritted my teeth to the end.  Yes, on one level it is fascinating as a piece of history.  Even I quite enjoyed the history of the U2 and Blackbird, which I vaguely remember from newspapers in my youth.  But as a chronicle of social mores, it made my toes curl.  Unfortunately, as a female of mid years clinging to the corporate ladder, I still remember when the kind of casual misogeny portrayed here was the norm not the exception.  Can't say I miss 'the good 'ol days' one bit.  The interchangeable wives and sophomoric giggling over the pin ups?     It isn't even very well written.    I have to read 'Patton on Leadership' next. Time to look for a new job maybe?
B000XCZGV8|5.0|This movie was a great surprise for me because I didn't think it would be good and it was great. Love the fact that it dosen't concentrate on the Zodiac but rather the detectives,news reporter, and political cartoonist who's lives are consumed with trying to piece together the identity of the maniac who held the San Fransico Bay Area hostage with threats for over a decade. If you like crime drama and who done it's you have to love this movie from the director of seven.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|This score is indeed excellent, but wouldn't say as good as the first one which had all the classical tracks that are easy to recognize by miles. The 2nd one didn't really do it for me, there was no magical cues as strong as the first and 3rd score from the trilogy.

(and as much disturbing as it is significant) since it's \\"based on a true story\\" is to see a country where they can allow some people to be judges who are capable of seeing proper that some future ex-wife who can't stand a honest husband is wanting to go to Las Vegas to raise their son.... As I see it, I have to understand that corruption is a requirement for husbands!!!

0060589469|1.0|I was required to read this book for an ethics class in college.  I did not enjoy it at all and found myself struggling to turn each successive page.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson's allegorical update of Upton Sinclair's \\"Oil\\" follows Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, the two men hell-bent of besting the other as their lives are chronicled in \\"There Will Be Blood.\\" Daniel Day Lewis' Oscar winning portrayal of Plainview is easily one of the decade's finest, yet little has been said of Paul Dano's job as Paul/Eli Sunday. As Eli, he is the dark side to faith that mirrors Plainview's ruthless competition.<br /><br />Early in the film, as Plainview conspires to grab the land around Little Boston, Eli asks for 10,000 dollars \\"for the church.\\" Plainview snorts and sneers \\"that's a good one.\\" Plainview already sees the Preacher's phoniness, which he continues to exploit as the movie grinds towards its climax. Still, Dano's simple but scheming portrayal of a man who uses God in his ruse much the same as Plainview uses the orphaned HW went unheralded next to Lewis' larger-than-life Oil Baron.<br /><br />And what an amazing character Plainview is. There is not a spoken word for the movie's first 10 minutes, relying only on Plainview's mannerisms and Johnny Greenwood's grating score. Soon Plainview becomes a rough-hewn but slick-salesman, all too willing to ruthlessly suck the land dry from under them because he can. \\"I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people,\\" he says to his brother...and then a betrayal soon after codifies Plainview's logic even further.<br /><br />When the two final betrayals occur at the end of the movie, Daniel Plainview's seething, stored hatred erupts as the final consequence in a life made of cruel ambition from a man who can only see the worst in people. The explosion of violence in a beautiful mansion highlights the contradiction even more, as Eli proves that he's just as willing to sell his soul as Plainview is eager to avenge his lack of one.<br /><br />Exquisitely filmed and languidly paced, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a terrific piece of work. Too bad, as many have pointed out, that it comes packaged in a shoddy fold-over cardboard cover that looks like you'd just bought some public domain cheapie from the corner mini-mart. Way to prestige package your best film of the year, Paramount.n a shoddy fold-over cardboard cover that looks like you'd just bought some public domain cheapie from the corner mini-mart.

B00122M2QU|5.0|At last the wait is over, the Cavalera brothers are back together again, this album just simply F***ING RULES!!!!!! enough said buy this album!!
B00154GEFU|4.0|I'll keep this pretty simple and concise.  \\"Never Again\\" is up there with Asia's very best.  Put it up against \\"The Heat Goes On\\" or \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" and it is right there with them.  \\"Heroine\\" is about as good a ballad I've heard in a while.  \\"Alibis\\" and \\"Shadow Of A Doubt\\" are very catchy songs with the big chorus trademark that made Asia huge in the first place.  There are a couple clunkers out of the twelve.  I'd have to say the rest is highly enjoyable and of extremely high quality performance-wise.  I can't say enough about Wetton.  He sounds as good as he ever did, superb vocals.  And his bass-playing has always been underrated.  Downes is all over the place....keyboard heaven.  Howe plays some great solos but I think his overall work on the album is a little too subdued given what we know he is capable of.  I'd say the same of Palmer who is one of the greatest drummers of all time.  I don't think he got to show all of his chops.  And I've gotta mention that in addition to my above comments about Wetton - he does every single one of the background vocals just like back in the day.  I think that is so impressive.  And of course, we can't overlook the Wetton/Downes songwriting team which made this album a triumph.  If you like Asia or any bands of the same genre, buy this immediately.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  And while your at it pick up their live album from last year, Fantasia.  It's brilliant.
B000YEUUCK|4.0|Very good performance from Celine, however I have some troubles with the Disc 1, in some parts of it, the sound doesn't work good. I have two of them and both have the same problem...
B00154GEFU|5.0|I am one who always praise for the 80s when it comes to music. Not only the pop music, not only for the new wave, but also for rock music. After the 70s, rock music has been reinvented and gained a whole new sonority, even with new subgenres arising out of it. Let's think of Asia not a representative of progressive rock, or rock music in general, but as a representative of good and well played music, whichever category it fits into.<br /><br />After listening to \\"Phoenix\\", I played [[ASIN:B00000HYY0 Anthology]] just to make a new revisit on what these guys used to do and compare to this new release. I have to admit: after all these years, their sound haven't changed a single thing. Artists and bands who are constantly releasing new albums every two or three years tend to change dramatically over the years and end up losing identity over time, usually for worse. The good thing about Asia is that, once they haven't been around with new releases for more than a couple of decades, they didn't feel the need to change anything.<br /><br />\\"Phoenix\\" is a ride back in time, but with fresh new songs. It's so related to their previous works that one might think that this record is made up of previously unreleased stuff, but they were recorded recently. All tracks are pretty enjoyable, and my special favorites are \\"Alibis\\", \\"I Will Remember You\\", \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\", all right in the middle of the album.<br /><br />Viva Asia! Welcome back to the map of music!
B00154GEFU|5.0|Connoisseurs would state a good bottle of wine as perfectly aged, exquisite and well refined. So does Phoenix - true, profound and mature Asia music for the true, profound and mature Asia fan. An end result of the original band in it's best nature after 25 years. Being reunited and still haven't changed not one bit is a total bore. It would end up being reminisced. Phoenix might not achieve the grandeur of the eponymous debut album and Alpha, but to the purist and devoted Asia fan, it is magnificently PERFECT, if I may say so. I believe the critics are not in a zen state of mind if they think Phoenix is just too shallow. Most have anticipated and waited for Phoenix to arrive and unfortunately not all were satisfied of it's presence. That's just being hypocritical. They just don't get it and never will.  Keep it clean and clear, the band is on the right focus path. Well done!
B000YABYLA|3.0|My title is directed towards those who complain \\"but no 16 year old would talk that way!!\\"  Well...duh?!?  Its a movie...if you want reality...go down to the projects where you'll see lots of pregnant teens--none of which are likely funny, ironic or amuzing like this film is...I liked the performances--especially the prospective parents--Bateman and Garner...I was drawn into Bateman's character and liked him and disliked Garner's character and to have my emotions twisted around to the exact opposite by the end was great...the editing was inconspicious and the direction kept the pace going without falling into an MTV style...well done, well acted, well told, enjoyable...just not HUGELY above average...
0375704027|5.0|How can one not like Murakami? His stories and prose are at once mysterious, psychological, fearless, gentle, expressive of love and compassion for women, art, jazz the Japanese way of life and American culture. He and his protagonists are men of extreme patience and have the ability to listen and comfort. Murakami  has chosen expert translators and talented book jacket designers. Like Hesse, his writing is gloriously poetic in English. And it is so much fun to learn of his love for British culture and European psychology: Fitzgerald, jazz, The Beatles, perhaps a a little Freud. I read his books on the subway going to and from work in Manhattan. His work is for persons unafraid of exploring the subconscious. Norwegian Wood readers don't have time and energy for reality television or America's Funniest Videos. This book (as does The Wind-up Bird Chronicle) makes one think. Entertaining and educating, not escapist. Original, to the last

B00133KFGW|5.0|Very blessed to have been able to see this movie in the theatres, and sorry that the general public at large was deprived of the chance.  Recommend it to anyone looking for uplifting and inspirational stories and especially for music lovers.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I'm a subscriber to Netflix. When I got their copy I watched it three times then almost wasn't able to give it to the postman to send back.  It doesn't make much logical sense as a story, but from the opening scene where it changes instantly from the auction to the full theater to the closing scene where you see a rose with a black ribbon, I was hooked. Of course the music stays in your head and won't go away and that's fine too. A lot better than some of the pop tunes I've suffered through. I can hardly wait until I run out of Netflix movies so I can watch my copy again.
B00008RH3L|5.0|\\"Miller's Crossing\\" is yet ANOTHER interpolation of Akira Kurosawa's \\"Yojimbo\\" (the other being \\"Last Man Standing\\", with Bruce Willis). The Coen brothers, however, did a fine job of \\"tweaking\\" the story to fit 1920's America. The sets, wardrobe, hardware and accoutrements come right out of the gangster period.    The Actors put forth first-rate performances, as well. Of special note are Albert Finney and John Turturro. Finney for the most memorable scene of standing in the middle of a residential street, emptying the drum of a Thompson Submachine gun at the car of men who were sent to assassinate him in his own home. Turturro for playing Marcia Gay Harden's oily, smarmy, double dealing brother, that makes himself out to be someone you just love to hate!    This film, like \\"The Untouchables\\", was convincing in it's portrayal of that violent period of American History. So it plays fast-and-loose with Akira Kurosawa's work, but it is a thrilling drama, nonetheless.
044024238X|4.0|Very good, with a few plot twists that kept me on my toes.  I throughly enjoyed reading this one.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I remember hearing two ex-coworkers raving about this movie when it came out. One of them was a backwards-baseball-hat-wearing Neanderthal with a \\"tribal\\" tattoo around his steroidal bicep, and the other was a keg-bellied 30 year old boy who still played video games. The endorsement of such people was all I really needed to know about this movie, but I guess ultimately I'm too much of a fair-minded rationalist to hold unsupported opinions, so I gave this movie its day in court. After seeing it, I have to say that I think there may be something to be said for the validity of prejudice. This movie reeked.<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill-Volume 1\\" is a shallow, boring and interminable cat fight. Since everyone knows the protagonist is in no real danger (after all, Uma Thurman is on the cover of the DVD for Volume 2), there's no real drama or excitement here, and since Tarantino couldn't be bothered providing us with even the most basic character background or development, I couldn't care less why Uma's erstwhile comrades tried to assassinate her or how she will get her inevitable revenge in the sequel.<br /><br />The movie amounts to nothing more than hot chicks fighting. For your average American fathead, I suppose that's all that's necessary. Everyone thinks that Tarantino's homage to cheesy 70s blacksploitation and martial arts flicks is cleverly ironic but I think those genres are actually the man's true artistic cynosure. He's not being brilliant when he references low budget cinematic ephemera- he's just showing that he's an arrested adolescent with no taste.
0452289963|5.0|This is a wonderful book for anyone searching for their \\"inner self\\".  It is well written and coincides with a weekly world wide web event hosted by Oprah and Eckhart Tolle.

B0010V4TZU|4.0|First off, you need to have a good listen to this record. The first time I sat down with it was really awesome, but it doesn't really have any staying power. Think the Strokes and the Police got together and had coffee with Mozart then smoked with Bob Marley. There are so many different influences here. It shouldn't work, but it does somehow. I really like the violin that is used. It makes their sound just that more melodic and full.<br /> I might say that these guys could be the flavor of the week, but this is their first record and they sound like indie legends already. Deffinitely worth your time.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Even if you're not a big fan of Mr. Moore, this movie is well worth your time and energy. It's not liberal or conservative, it's beyond politics or idealogy, it's where America is today, in the early 21st century regarding how this country takes care of it's own citizens and the health and medical industry.<br />Possibly the best of his movies.

B0016CXCTC|5.0|I think it is a wonderful album.  I enjoy Asia from all of its incarnations.  It is good to see this lineup making new music as opposed to just an endless nostaglia tour. Cheers!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|In my opinion there are only two current American actors in cinema today that can be described as genius.  One is Phillip Seymour Hoffman and the other is Paul Giamatti.  For a rebirth in faith in our country and the people who suffered greatly for it one only needs to sit through this amazing series and let it allow you to realize how lucky we are to have the freedoms we unfortunately take for granted on a daily basis.  Giamatti is like nothing I've ever seen before.  I can only say that if one sits through this entire series and doesn't feel some sense of patriotism then they simply are not alive.
0670018651|5.0|I just bought this book, and haven't been able to put it down, it's a great read cover to cover.    I loved the reviews, almost all of which I agreed with where I've had the opportunity to try out the scent in question.    This is a terrific book for perfume lovers and wannabes.     It is a field guide to the great perfumes still available     ----and a consumer guide to avoid the gutted hulking remains of former glory still sold under their original names.    Thank you to the authors for their work and for the witty sparkling writing style.    I laughed out loud all afternoon and even coaxed a laugh out of a friend who called me in the middle.     She is suffering from cancer and having a medium to lousy sort of day.    She cheered right up as I looked up reviews of her favourites, some of which are 2 stars, and one 4 star fragrance.     I've enjoyed Fabulous Fragrances II by Jan Moran, but her reviews are all positive, she rarely has a negative word to say, while this book says a lot of helpful negative things even about fragrances that the authors like.

B0010V4TZU|4.0|I am not a likely listener for this, as all the folks it is compared to and contrasted with are utterly unknown to me. If I need to be deeply schooled in indie/alternative/some-other-adjectival music, then you can ignore my opinion. But if a guy who enjoys many kinds of music, and whose listening library probably includes far more genres than the average illegal-downloader, has any validity, this gets an enthusiastic thumbs up.<br /><br />Many years ago I heard an LP by a previously unknown-to-me band named Squeeze. East Side Story was, and is, a tour de force of pop music. Extraordinary arrangements, brilliant songwriting, charming and skilled musicianship and singing, variety that was not there to fulfill some requirement, and a hit single that wasn't even among the three best songs on the LP made a record that was hard to beat. And, as my LP advertised in a sticker on the outside, the darn thing was full! 14 songs of 100% pure beat and no filler, with, in my opinion, 13 of the 14 qualifying as excellent.<br /><br />For the first time in over 20 years I'm having a similar response. My daughter, who was not yet born when I purchased East Side Story, and is quite well-informed in the indie/alternative/obscuro/crackpot music circles, thought I'd enjoy this, and she was spot on again. (Last thing she suggested was Sigur Ros.)  Unexpected, surprising, smart, funny, clever and incredibly well put together, this CD delightfully reminds me of the pleasure I had discovering Squeeze. With two exceptions. First, this thing ain't full. 34 minutes is a bit stingy these days, though if this is what they had, I'd prefer it to padding it with dregs (which I think they already did with two of these cuts.) But this much invention sure makes me long for more. And second, there is a lot more uniformity to the flavor. If they did go beyond those 34 minutes, I would certainly hope they could use a different sound.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I don't know what's in the water in Hollywood these days, but filmmakers are _finally_ being allowed to make intelligent endings to movies.  Remember how the ending to \\"Blair Witch Project\\" made the hair on the back of your neck stand up?  And this year, you got the same feeling with \\"No Country for Old Men\\"?  This movie, \\"Cloverfield\\", gives you that same breathless feeling at the end.  I mean, it's a Godzilla movie, so there's lots of monster stomping on NYC, but the sly use of the taped-over love story is absolutely brilliant.  I think I teared up after that last scene.      If Abrams can do this with a monster movie, I can hardly wait 'til his \\"Star Trek\\" comes out.

The interlinking song themes are good, as are some of the lyrics, but the music is quite unadventurous and Ian Anderson's voice is gruff and monotonous. I think one difficulty may be the sound quality of this CD reissue - maybe with better sound i would have a different opinion.
0684135051|5.0|This is a great book- for a beginner.  I unfortunately bought it well after I'd been knitting for a while, and found it very simple and not what I needed.  I have, however, used it to teach others, and have found it a great reference book for the beginner.  It is very much a literature book, though, with a few patterns at the end of the book, one of which I've personally used and found quite wonderful and precise.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Through my years I have watched and learned to appreciate the world I live in through the work of others who have taken upon themselves the task of showing every nook and cranny, the diversity and the living breathing world we live in through documentaries such as this. What I discovered while watching Planet Earth is that there were many things, places and beings that I had never seen or heard of before. I would recommend to everybody to watch and enjoy this series since it may bring an appreciation of what we are doing to this world and what is worth to renew, reuse, recycle and protect for future generations.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|A classic in every sense of the word.  My kids both love it, and watch it at least twice a week.  I love how well they did cleaning the film up and making it like new again.  A must have for any Disney video collection.
B000UR9TQE|4.0|With out a doubt Zeppelin in their prime was the best band that ever rocked the stage. Zeppelin themselves said that \\"The Song Reamains the Same\\" was the worlds most expensive home video and they themselves were not too happy with it. All this new version is really is the same thing that they are selling all over again but with todays advancement features a bit more so than anything new.  Would have been always really cool if they would have made this with just the jams on stage through out the soloing as opposed to their fantasy impressions. Many of us Musicians always wanted to see Bonzo do the whole drum solo rather than Level a pool table or drive a dragster. Or see Jimmy Page do all of the guitar work instead of climbing that rocky hill with his climbing shoes on.  But at least there is more of that within \\"How the west was won\\".  For me the real difference within the new version of \\"The Song remains the same\\" is really nothing but a few features.  But it is still really cool in that sense and it is nice to go back to the 70's to the midnight movies and rock!
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin has been a family favorite since it came out, and they did a bang-up job remastering it.  A wonderful addition to any Disney video collection.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Very well written comedy drama series. Lauren Graham's character is quick witted and very funny and the story line is very entertaining. She plays a single mother raising her daughter by herself. She fled her home and her stuffy, uptight, wealthy and very restrictive mother to make a life for herself and her daughter. Somewhat of a free spirit the story line is often a role reversal where her daughter is the adult and she the child. All in all a light-hearted series that uplifts the spirit and makes you anxious to see what happens next.
B000WO251Q|5.0|I love Sparks and all of his books and Dear John is just a great over all story of what alot of people are going through right now being in the Army and how it is so hard to have a relationship. But this is a great book and I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who is a Sparks fan, or who just likes to read.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Excellent; very different track almost like a jam session!  You will either love it or hate it.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|A excellent series with breathtaking views and surround sound.  Almost seems like you are viewing 3d pictures.  Would highly recommend the HD or Blu-Ray versions.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|I have seen this movie before, oh I remember, \\"the omega man\\". this is simply an updated version of that classic film. I was not impressed with this movie. it moved far too slow and nothing was explained. the flashbacks were annoying and did not add anything to the movie.
015626224X|5.0|I like Orwell's prose style, which is curt, clear and to the point, so it isn't surprising that I enjoyed this book. I was a bit wary at first, thinking I wouldn't enjoy reading about squalor, but Orwell brings to life a whole world of tramps and hunger without trying to elicit pity. The section on working in French restaurants is great, and so is his encounter with Bozo, the street artist in London. The book is not an exhaustive coverage of poverty; it is deprivation seen impressionistically by an author who was extremely poor for a period of time. The constant in the book is poverty and the search for food and a bed, but the experiences are varied, sometimes amusing, and the characters he meets are different. An interesting glimpse into the past, told humanely but without sentimentality.
0375424474|3.0|I am always in search of popular science books that can reach the general public, but still contain information of  interest/use to professionals in the field.  I find that Shubin's book was great at the former but not so good at the latter. For a more challenging text on this topic, try \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom \\" by Sean Carroll.
0060558121|1.0|I made it to page 216 on this one, which is a sign the writing is not terrible. And the premise looks intriguing on paper: the old gods of Europe, brought over by immigrants, are battling with the new gods of technology (shopping, TV). Unfortunately it is all centred around this ex-con named Shadow, who is employed by one of the  old gods as a bodyguard. Shadow is a flat character to whom things happen; he's got no sense of the sacred, it seems, and he seems hardly fazed as he moves from the world of Mickey D's and Greyhounds to the world of Mickey Ds',  Greyhounds and old gods. And there seems to be a reason for this in that Gaiman's tone is so casual, so whatever, and blah that you feel that gods are just boring, normal folk. Who wants to read about boring folk who hire non-emotional characters to fight a war against what? new gods who behave like thuggish stockbrokers? The book is unimaginative and the writing almost never sparkles; it's just chockfull of  cliches. At one point Shadow's dead wife comes to visit him, and she's obviously a corpse; her breath stinks and her feet leave dirt on the floor. You'd expect that kind of scene to be somewhat emotional, or thrilling, but it left me yawning. It was all downhill from there, to the point where I had to stop. You may wish to continue, but I don't envy you at all.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|So far this is the best Celtic Woman cd. The overall presentation is outstanding. All of the vocals are great. However, the songs by Lisa Kelly make the cd a 10+
B0010358EE|4.0|Cool movie with great CGI...and its a combo so you could watch it on HD or stardard
B0007M22TI|5.0|This is truly a great cd. Based on the cast members, and the instrumental presentation the cd is rated a 10+.
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|Great CD, wish they would have come with it sooner.  Great music and lyrics.  Band is growing up and getting better.  Really enjoyed and I keep listening to it every 3rd day.
0066620996|5.0|This book does a great job of making business interesting. It literally reads like a novel. I couldn't put it down, even though I just completed it for the third time. Although I do not subscribe to it in totality, its concepts are based upon thousands of research hours and are well presented with plenty of examples from the famous companies included in the book. I have handed it out to the management team of a recently purchased company and have no doubt that at the very least it will stimulate strategic thinking. I recommend it highly!
0452289963|3.0|I had trouble finding the subtitle of this book - Awakening to Your Life's Purpose - anywhere in the book.  I bought it expecting that it would be an enlightened read on purpose, calling, destiny, faith, acceptance of God's will or something remotely similar.  I ultimately didn't find this to be the case, but again I could have missed it in the very dense prose that was the first 70 pages of the book.     The first part of the book appears to be a discussion of our sense of self - that we equate too much of our self-worth with accomplishments and external things rather than our plain state of being.  We don't celebrate our spirits and existence enough; instead we get wrapped up in what others think of us, the rat race of life, etc.  Maybe that's where the \\"life purpose\\" part comes into play - that our purpose isn't really to \\"achieve\\" anything, but just to be? That's a tough one for most to swallow.  I wonder how Oprah is doing with it.       The second part of the book is really about the ego - the part that has most people talking about the book, but is actually the least novel.  The idea is that we are a \\"me-centered\\" world.  It's a lot like the old adage \\"You'd care a lot less about what others think of you if you only knew how little they do.\\" Funny and true.  We are a self-absorbed nation.  We focus on our accomplishments, what we deserve, what we don't have in comparison to the next person, etc.  But is that really new or did my mother teach me that when I was 8? I love the concepts, but they don't seem groundbreaking.      And while I think the author's assertion that we are unhappy because of this me-focused attitude is dead-on, I'm not sure there were helpful suggestions for how to change that either.     So while I appreciate the ideas behind the book (hence the 3 stars) and have the utmost respect for writers, I just didn't think the concepts were that novel.  If they were, I think the writing was too dense to pick up on them (for this dummie at least).This one is a tough tough read.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|New Amerykah......I just what the game needs......something different. All the Hogwash that's flooding the airwaves has been driving me insane. I'm glad Erykah stays true to herself and keeps putting out dope musik.
B0007GAERG|5.0|So, `The Emancipation of Mimi' has been lauded as the return of the voice.  In fact, that is as true as it can possibly be for this album is certainly Carey's finest since `Butterfly'.  I can't say it's an exact return of the voice since her voice is a lot more breathy than her previous works, but she has definitely returned to form in that she has delivered a track listing worthy of her fame and fortune.  In fact there is not one track here that is not outstanding.  I still feel that `Butterfly' is overall her greatest album to date, but `The Emancipation of Mimi' definitely resides close behind it.  She has a great mix of hearty ballads and club worthy dance tracks and she gives her all too each and every track.  Mariah Carey had received her fair share of flak in the years proceeding `Glitter' and preceding `The Emancipation of Mimi' but here is her answer back to the legions of people claiming she had lost it all and would never get it back.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the single `It's Like That' featuring the likes of Fat Man Scoop and Jermaine Dupri.  It's not the most involving single; it's pretty much a catchy beat and Mariah setting the record straight, that no matter what anyone says she's here to stay.  It's not the best track here but it sets the stage nicely.  She keeps the same club beat mentality on finer tracks like `Get Your Number' with Jermaine Dupri, a track that shines through and through.  On `Stay The Night' Mariah's killer vocals are accompanied by a nice throwback beat that recalls the golden years of R&B while still remaining fresh and new.  In fact, `Stay The Night' may just very well be my favorite track here, but there are so many that resonate high with me it's hard to really nail down a favorite.  `To The Floor' features the talents of Nelly and they work so well together.  The beat is enticing and makes it almost impossible to remain still.  `Shake It Off' has a very bouncy vibe that makes it instantly contagious.  I will admit that radio really overdid this one, but it's still a great track.<br /><br />There are two tracks that are perfect examples of collaborations done right.  `Say Somethin' with Snoop Dogg and Pharell of N.E.R.D. is one great vibin' song.  It just has the right atmosphere, the right beat, the right lyrics and the right chemistry between the artists, but if we're going to talk about killer chemistry we have to mention Mariah and Twista's collaborations.  `One And Only is superbly done with Mariah keeping the pace with the fire spitter himself.  It works beautifully.  Mariah's voice soars here.<br /><br />`We Belong Together' is a great ballad of lost love.  Mariah's voice is top notch here.  In fact, it's on these types of ballads where Mariah has always been able to prove her weight and she does that to phenomenal heights on this album.  `Mine Again' is touching and there are moments within the chorus where her voice can give the listener chills.  `Circles' is another fantastic opportunity for Mariah to soar, and she takes that opportunity.  `I Wish You Knew' is a beautiful throwback and carries and older vibe that I adore.  `Your Girl' is one of the best songs here.  Resting nicely between ballad and pop track it allows Mariah's voice to excel while allowing Mariah to have some real fun.  It's got such a catchy vibe to it you'll be bobbing your head and singing along on no time.  `Joy Ride' is a decent track but `Fly Like A Bird' is truly outstanding.  Following the `Hero' or even `Butterfly' formula, `Fly Like A Bird' has that inspirational feel to it, and it works beautifully.<br /><br />This is where the album ends.<br /><br />Mariah has succeeded in reinventing herself and proving to the world that she still has it, never lost it and will always continue to shine.adio really overdid this one, but it's still a great track.

B0011NVC9I|4.0|I was excited about seeing this movie for a while, so once it was released my friends and I decided to call it a `guy's night' and throw back some beers and watch us some `Beowulf'.  Sure, it's a cartoon, but it's so much more than just a cartoon.  I personally enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  Yes, it's campy but intentionally so, and yes it is a bit extreme, but that's where all the fun lies.  I will admit that I totally prefer my actors in live action mode, and I would have loved to see this `in living color' so-to-speak.  I think that all the actors used are talented and would have done a phenomenal job in their respective roles.  Ray Winstone is a brilliant actor, even if he is not widely known, and while he is not physically a specimen like that of Beowulf (he's more on the `beefy' side) I still would have loved to see him take it on in the flesh.<br /><br />I am dying now to get my hands on the actual poem.<br /><br />The film follows the warrior Beowulf as he slaughters the monster known as Grendel, a monster that proved to be a curse for King Hrothgar.  When Beowulf attempts to kill Grendal's revenge seeking mother he is seduced by her beauty and falls captive to her curse.  That curse follows Beowulf well into his rule as King and serves as the catalyst for a most epic battle that pits father against son.<br /><br />I can't say that I'm fresh on all the details of the poem that spawned this film, I still need to watch this a couple more times and, as I mentioned, get my hands on the classic itself, but I can say that it is a most interesting story indeed.  Director Robert Zemeckis delivers a solid action adventure film that is thrilling as much as it is entertaining.  The battle scenes are memorable and engrossing, especially the final dragon battle that is nothing short of mesmerizing.  Beowulf's battle with Grendal is done well also, even if it recalls certain comical moments from `Austin Powers'.<br /><br />The acting is decent, as decent as can be expected.  The only actor who is really required to do much acting at all is Winstone, and he pulls his weight.  Angelina Jolie dons that horrible accent from `Alexander' once again, but she's only on the screen twice and both times you won't be listening to the words coming out of her mouth.  Anthony Hopkins does a mean drunk, and John Malkovich is funny as the bitter Unferth.  Robin Wright Penn is a little dead and fails to really deliver anything close to a performance here.  It's hard to judge since the film is, in the end, a cartoon.  While the eyes are undoubtedly human the facial expressions are one-note most of the time.  `Ratatouille' is a better example of expressive animation.<br /><br />In the end \\"Beowulf' is a lot of fun even if it isn't perfection.  I rather enjoyed the campiness of the film; I thought it added a comical edge I wasn't expecting.  This is not a film for children by any means.  It is littered with gore, nudity and innuendos.  I'm floored it remained PG-13 and it truly pushes the boundaries to an extreme.  For you adults though, `Beowulf' is where you should look for a guilt free (or is it guilty) good time.really required to do much acting at all is Winstone, and he pulls his weight.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|Bruce Spingsteen has been quite buzy in this decade (after a 6 year lul following 1995's \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\"), indeed this release marks the 6th release in 7 years (The Rising; Live in New York City; Devils & Dust; We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions; Live in Dublin; and now this).<br /><br />\\"Magic\\" (12 tracks, including one \\"bonus\\" track; 48 min.) is a breath of fresh air, as it really truly brings back the sound of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band as we had come to know and love them in the 70s and 80s (sorry, but \\"The Rising\\" album was a 'false' alarm in my opinion). Lead-off track (and first single) \\"Radio Nowhere\\" sets the tone and feels like it could have been a track from the \\"Born in the USA\\" era. Strong track after strong track follows, and really there isn't a weak track on here. My personal favorites on here include \\"Livin' In the Future\\", \\"Girls In THeir Summer Clothes\\", the title track and the 'closer' \\"Devil's Arcade\\". It really isn't the closer as it is followed by a bonus track \\"Terry's Song\\", a solo track from Bruce in tribute to Terry Magovern who passed away while the album was being recorded. In all, \\"Magic\\" is just that, a fantastic album by one of the legends in the music business.<br /><br />I had the good fortune of seeing Bruce and the band in concert last month here in Cincinnati, and they put on a fantastic 2 hr. 20 min. set that included a bunch of songs from the \\"Magic\\" album, alongside a number of Bruce's classics. The \\"Magic\\" songs fitted in perfectly with those classics, and that is about the best compliment anyone could make about this album.
0312379293|5.0|Some of the best authors write too many novels which become less intriguing and poorly written. Not so Jeffrey Archer. This book is/was one of the best I have ever read!!! I did not want the story to end. As I read the book I saw myself turning it into a movie with Russell Crowe or Jude Law and Sean Connery as the elder lawyer.  The story was compelling and the ending was so satisfying.  Revenge is sweet. Read it. YOu won't be disappointed.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Love, love, love it! Sally Hawkins is phenomenal as Ms. Eliot. The emotions that she conveys without words seem to jump from the screen. This quite easily make its way to the top of the Austen best of list. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves good writing, great acting, and beautiful storylines.  5 stars.  If you like this you also may enjoy the 2007 Sense and Sensibilty as well.
B000002KIT|5.0|THE BAND: Phil Lynott (vocals, bass... R.I.P.), Scott Gorham (guitars), Brian Robertson (guitars), Brian Downey (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1978) 17 tracks clocking in at approximately 77 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing black & white concert related photos, song titles/times/credits, and thank you's. Songs recorded during the `Johnny The Fox' (1976) and `Bad Reputation' (1977) tours. A digitally remastered version (1996) is also available. All songs written by Thin Lizzy members except \\"Rosalie\\" (by Bob Seger - taken from his \\"Back in `72\\" album). Label - Warner Bros.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Vagabonds Of The Western World (1 song), Nightlife (2), Fighting (2), Jailbreak (5), Johnny The Fox (3), Bad Reputation (2), Unreleased (2).<br /><br />COMMENTS: This is a great live album. I put it on the same lofty perch as some of those other live 70's classics - Deep Purple's \\"Made In Japan\\", Frampton's \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\", The Who's \\"Live At Leeds\\", Kiss' \\"Alive!\\" and UFO's \\"Strangers In The Night\\". With that being said, there is some controversy - technical issues brought the band back into the studio to overdub and re-record some guitars and vocals - how much of this is true (?)... we listeners and fans may never really know. As for the sound - the album rocks. Lynott sounds great (as does his bass). The dueling guitars of Gorham and Robertson are in blazing form. And Brian Downey is steady on drums (and getting a chance to really cut loose on the \\"Sha-La-La\\" drum solo). The track listing here is superb (hits and deep album tracks included). So many great Thin Lizzy songs - classics rockers include \\"Jailbreak\\", \\"Massacre\\", \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\", \\"Sha-La-la\\", \\"Warrior\\", \\"Emerald\\", \\"The Rocker\\", \\"Suicide\\", etc. And for every two bone crunching songs there's a melodic masterpiece - \\"Southbound\\", \\"Dancing In The Moonlight\\", \\"Johnny The Fox Meets Jimmy The Weed\\", \\"Cowboy Song\\", and \\"Still In Love With You\\". For me, standouts on this album were always the heavy \\"Emerald\\", Lynott's storytelling on \\"Johnny The Fox...\\", the opener \\"Jailbreak\\", and the beautifully crafted \\"Still In Love With You\\" - which I actually like 10x better than the studio version from \\"Nightlife\\" (1974). Only thing missing from this classic live album are a few songs - \\"Whiskey In The jar\\", \\"She Knows\\", \\"Wild One\\" and \\"Bad Reputation\\". I don't care about any 'controversy' - this album rocks and still sounds fantastic decades later. If you want one live album from Thin Lizzy, this is the one. \\"Live & Dangerous\\" is a great album from a truly legendary band (5 stars).bum were always the heavy \\"Emerald\\", Lynott's storytelling on \\"Johnny The Fox...\\", the opener \\"Jailbreak\\", and the beautifully crafted \\"Still In Love With You\\" - which I actually like 10x better than the studio version from \\"Nightlife\\" (1974).

B000UD0ESA|4.0|not much of a big difference from the directors cut - from what i can tell. the images DO seem to be cleaner and sharper though. still a classic film!!!     the bonus disc also has some good stuff, though the documentary seems a little too long.
0452289963|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone, young & old.  I was never able to define the ego so explicit in my mind and now this book has become my new bible.  It's called Awakening, because the book confirms only what we've known all the long in our hearts and in our spirits.  It's helped me to not only define my feelings, but also to embrace them, and redirect them to a more positive meaning.  Thank you Mr. Tolle for your insights and teachings of ourselves.
B000068FWC|1.0|This album takes me back to the beach in the long, hot summer of 1979. Wouldn't that be reason enough to own it and play it frequently? But I don't.<br />Here's why. It's the title track. 'Breakfast' contains some good songs with reasonable lyrics (Take the long way home, Lord is it mine, Casual conversations) but it's the title track that stinks. And not just a little bit, but with such force that owning this CD is an embarrasment. Let me be a little more specific.<br />The song itself is a filler. Anybody could have written this dumb, nondescript little melody. The arrangement is not worth mentioning. And now for the words:<br />'Take a look at my girlfriend, she's the only one I've got'. Are we supposed to praise him for his fidelity, or mourn the lack of other girlfriends?<br />'Not much of a grilfriend, I never seem to get a lot'. Therapy might help.<br />'Take a Jumbo cross the water, like to see America.' Is that escapism, or just a holiday?<br />'See the girls in California' ... Good idea.<br />'Hoping it's going to come true, 'cause there's not a lot I can do.' What must come true? And why is it that there's not a lot you can do?<br />'Lalalala, lalala lalalaladida.' Gimme a break ...<br /><br />I simply don't understand why anybody in his right mind would allow this childish scribble to be published all over the world.<br /><br />I think I'll skip breakfast. What's for supper?
0345403959|3.0|Backstory the elder.      In a similar fashion to the Polgara the Sorceress volume, here we get the backstory of ubersorcerer Belgarath, and learn why he is so.    It all has to do with good gods and bad goods and the disciples of such, along with whacky sorcerer-name prefixes.    Old is certainly the word for this bloke, and it gives you more of an overview of what is going on.  Again, basically better than the main series.      2.5 out of 5
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this video.  Jillian really whips you into shape in no time.  I have two children and I can do this workout because it is only 20 minutes, my daughter loves it to, she does it with me, so I make it a family event.
B0000524CY|4.0|The Exorcist - The Version You've Never Seen is also the version you probably shouldn't have, adding almost nothing to a fine original but running time, some clumsy additional `subliminal' images digitally grafted on with all the subtlety of a 1980s New Romantic music video and a poor new sound mix that adds music cues and sound effects far less effective than the original mix. Most of the restored footage is taken up by an extended additional medical tests sequence that feels a little out of place since Regan hasn't been acting particularly oddly at that point in the film, as well as the odd bit of padding in the run-up to the exorcism and a redundant scene of Karras listening to a tape recording of a pre-possession Regan. Worst of the new additions by far is the infamous spider walk, a scene abandoned during shooting and here accounting for two rather laughable shots that take the film too far too soon. Other additions are somewhat more esoteric - a brief pretitle shot of the Georgetown house and street, Father Dyer keeping the St Christopher at the end after Chris hands it back and the disastrous addition of a screeching airplane sound effect in the segue from Iraq to Georgetown that makes you think Pazuzu must have travelled to Washington by Pan-Am (although this does echo Lalo Schifrin's far more effective rejected scoring for the sequence).     What's most curious is what's still missing: despite including the weak Hollywood ending with Kinderman and Father Dyer, the exchange with Chris over whether she still doesn't believe in God is gone. The big bone of contention between Blatty and Friedkin, the idea that if you believe in the Devil because of all the terrible things that happen, you must also believe in a God even if he, unlike the horned one, doesn't advertise, seems the only justification for extending the section at all, but as if to spite the writer it's still pointedly removed. Only the brief discussion about the Devil's motives for possessing Reganin a break in the exorcism feels like it adds any substance to the proceedings (although it could be said the possession is more disturbingly arbitrary if left unexplained), the rest being motivated purely by the need for a marketing hook to secure a US reissue.     The end result is a film that feels much longer and slower but still eventually grips. Aside from the overlength, the strengths and weaknesses are much the same: the at times almost documentary style of film-making grounds the events in a recognisable real world, the shock effects are fairly sparingly used and only after a long build-up, the characters well-drawn and their despair convincing: the real horror in the film doesn't reside in its special effects or horrific set pieces, but in a mother's anguish over being powerless to help her child.     Few extras, but the widescreen transfer is good.
B000L43QJ2|5.0|This version of Swan Lake is choregraphed by Rudolph Nureyev and is classical ballet at its best.  The soloists dance with precision and have a beautiful presence.  The corps de ballet dance are breath-takingly beautiful -- the choreography is exquisite.  The camera angles also bring out the excitement and passion of this ballet.  It's as if we are seeing the shape of the soul of Swan Lake through the ballet.
1932100660|5.0|I bought this book for my niece whose son has an inoperable brain tumour.  Once I opened it up however I could not put it down and I feel it has changed my own life in a completely positive way.  I have my own medical issues and have been ill a lot in the past five years.  Now I have given up meat almost entirely and milk products entirely and I feel 50-100% better in a few weeks.    My niece is reading the book now, not sure if she will be able to convince her son to follow the diet, he hates vegetables but since milk proteins are the worst offenders maybe she can get him off milk and cheese.    I highly recommend this book to anyone.  I bought an extra copy for my niece to put in the lending library at their local cancer society office.
B00104QSOM|4.0|I was quite surprised by this movie.  It wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about.   Daniel Day Louis is excellent as the greedy and selfish Daniel Plainfield.   The movie is different than I expect by the fact that there was such a rivalary between greed and religion.   I don't know who the character of the young religious healer was but I hated him from the spot.  He played an excellent roll because I could understand how he got under Daniel' skin.  The realationship between Daniel and the boy and then his brother showed how he was nice to each one of them but when they did something against Daniel, Daniel got total revenge with no half measures.    Daniel was never even interested in women because they were never as important as money.   I like the fact that he was so independant and would not sell out to Standard Oil.  I thought he was going represent a big oil conclomerate as opposed to an indivual.  Which is why the movie worked so well because you had to wait and see who would get his sole.   I like in the end that they showed who the charlaton really was and what he had to do to pay for it.  Overall I think people who are independant will like this movie, it moves slow at first but it speeds up as it goes along.   The extras on the DVD 2nd disk were interesting and stressed the conflict between religion and greed.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this film...I had already ordered and listened to the soundtrack previously because my wife and I love the Beatles' music. Additionally, I had seen Hair and Rent in the past and had those 2 films to compare it to. My expectations were, thus, pretty high.  Apart from the \\"magical mystery tour\\" with Bono in the middle of the film, I found it moving, fast-paced, interesting....despite the 2-hour-plus length. I liked it much more than \\"Rent\\"; the Beatles' songs were appropriately placed; the visual art was enthralling and unique and had a poetic depth, i.e., it had many levels of meaning beyond the purely breath-taking visual effects.    I was not at all disappointed. I highly recommend this film!
B000X5KSWM|1.0|Being a fan of Nightwish, I really had high-hopes for this CD.  Tarja didn't leave Nightwish under the best of circumstances, so this should have been her big chance to break free and show us her chops.  Nope.    With Nightwish, not only was the solid music was a good contrast to Tarja's operatic style vocals, it masked the fact that she's just not that strong of a singer.    Because EVERY song on \\"My Winter Storm\\" sounds like melancholy Cirque du Soleil music, Tarja's vocals are front and center throughout which really shows her limitations.  You'll find yourself thinking that there's got to be thousands of singers out there who are more qualified to make a CD like this.  But then again, more experienced singers probably wouldn't have made a CD like this.  For those of you expecting this to be in the \\"symphonic metal\\" genre, it isn't.  In fact, there's really not a heavy number on this CD.  Just when you think something is about to happen, the tempo and energy drop to nothing.  Every song ends up sounding like the same uninspired pablum with goofy lyrics.  I'm not even sure where you would even listen to this CD.  It's too slow for the general consumption of its metallic target audience, and way too annoying to listen to while falling asleep.
B0010X8NF0|3.0|The thing I like about this movie is the fact that all these guys in certain parts of the movie, like when they were trying to meditate just look at each other like \\"yea this is stupid, why are we just staring at each other?\\" This movie wasn't bad though. I really did not get the scene when they went to get the deceased father's car, but other than that it was very comical and entertaining.
B00102FELM|5.0|This was an awesome concert bringing together old band members and family members and they play a variety of old and new songs. It ROCKS!!
0307277887|5.0|This novel was great fun and a wonderful read.  I am a fan of the series so was interested in reading the books too.  I had heard that the series and books were different but that is a good thing.  This is not a novelization of a TV series.  The story is quite absorbing and is very similar to the show, but actually the show has more details and plot complications.  That is not a bad thing.  This book has economy of writing and it keeps you reading from beginning to end.  I loved the book as much as the series and would highly recommend both of them.  What a great book and I haven't read something this fun for years.  Dexter is a great first start for a book series.  I hope the others are just as good or close.

B00132D808|4.0|Remember in 1985 when they introduced \\"New Coke\\" and the reception was so horrible the incident is now regarded as one of the biggest marketing flops in history. With the bands new release, \\"Pretty. Odd,\\" Panic At The Disco have introduced what could be referred to as 'New Panic!' Except this time the ingredients are creativity, rich harmonies and even psychedelic ballads (what?! ..read on, my friend). Yes, many diehard fans are going to hate the new album. They will cry in their rooms and ask 'why Panic? WHY?' I'll tell you why, Because they can - and they can do it well! Really well!    Don't get me wrong, I love PATD's first album, \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.\\" The high energy synth drums and fast witted one liners rang from my car for months. But what after that? First it hits the radios, then the TV, pretty soon we'd be hearing this stuff on Radio Disney. What would you do? Well Panic went along and created something different, something, dare I say, \\"Pretty. Odd.\\"    I'd hate to make a comparison to \\"The Beatles,\\" but the album brings to mind some of the odd song structures and psychedelic lyrics of the Beatles late 60's sound - with a modern twist. Crunchy guitar riffs, rich horns and great vocal harmonies fuse into one cohesive sound. Unlike many albums we see in today's homogenous scene, this album delivers a variety of sounds. Between the pop influenced \\"Nine In The afternoon\\" to the jazzy \\"I've Got Friends In Holy Spaces\\" to the folksy song aptly named \\"Folkin' Around\\" the album does not drag at any point.     So please try out the \\"New Panic.\\" It's crisps refreshing taste may be a bit bold at first, but try another sip and you'll be chugging it down like chocolate milk in no time.    Highlights: Nine In The Afternoon, That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed), Northern Downpour, Behind The Sea    4.6 out of 5
B000XA5K48|4.0|To all you pansies who go on and on about this being a \\"silly\\" and overblown violent movie:     Get over it, pansies!    This is not \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" \\"The Bicycle Thief,\\" or \\"Casabalanca\\" (all admittedly fantastic movies, all five-star classics, and I love them all dearly).    It is a fun time for those who have a working sense of wit--NOT humor, because any lowborn mutt has a sense of humor, but of actual wit--and who, say, likes an action movie populated with people as opposed to robots that turn into cars. (Seriously, if you like \\"Transformers\\" and didn't like this, you're a moron, and there's no argument brooked about it.)    Furthermore, it does have certain Western-movie overtones that reminded me of something Vladimir Nabokov wrote about Hollywood films: to the effect that in American Westerns, you can see hundreds of people get shot, but \\"you're not sorry! You're not sorry for any one of them!\\" This is how \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" proceeds: most of those who get shot and killed richly, RICHLY deserve to be sent to the next life or, as I would tend to believe, to oblivion. And this is from an avid opponent of the government death penalty.    Furthermore, it is the first film, in my memory, that effectively used the classic Motorhead track \\"Ace of Spades\\" in a gunfight sequence. Neither Tarantino nor Rodriguez was THAT clever and smart about music.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|This is a nice movie, but it allows a lot of liberties. I assume producers want to make more modern version of Jane Eyre. I bet in the next adaptation Jane will have sex with Mr. Rochester on the 3rd day and they will have treesome with Ms. Ingram.  In this version they are almost having sex, while in the book she at most allowed him to kiss her. They look like two young people in love. There appearances not even close to the book.   May be it is me, but Ruth Wilson's big mouth and sound of her voice turn me off.  There are some nice special effects which older versions luck, but I don't think they are so important.  Ms. Ingram has blond hair and much too nice and intelligent. In the book she was brunet and called Jane \\"this person\\". She would never smile to Jane, talk to her and call Jane by her name. In this movie it is not clear why Jane and Adele should be out of the house if this Ms. Ingram became a bride. Ms. Ingram brilliantly shown in Dalton's movie. When she didn't even reply on Mrs. Fairfax greetings, one can understand what kind of person she is.  T. Dalton version is the best version. I give M. Jayston solid second place. I read a book and looked at every version.

0743297334|3.0|I expected to like this novel. I was surprised that I did not. Perhaps I can explain why. Perhaps I cannot. Let me make an effort, though I fear it shall please no one.<br /><br />I do not know if I'll open another Hemingway book anytime soon, but since this was the first novel by this writer I have read, maybe it's premature to make judgments about his entire body of work. Still, as I struggled through one flat and boring chapter after the next in the dialogue-driven The Sun Also Rises, populated as it was with single-dimensional characters I did not like, situations that disgusted me, and settings that were admittedly nicely-described, I kept having a thought that no doubt qualifies among Hemingway fans as heresy: do the masses truly like Hemingway's novels, or are they swept up in the mystique of his legend to the point that this carries into the books themselves and therein explains their power to draw so much praise?<br /><br />Frankly, folks, I didn't see a lot to embrace here. Hemingway's sentences were like bare skeletons devoid of flesh above them. I expected genius and found mediocrity: mediocrity and a cast of spoiled, mildly tragic middle-aged figures who drank themselves sick, quarreled, traipsed across western Europe and left behind abandoned children and jilted spouses, all in pursuit of the excitement that eluded them. They did not even have the excuse of youth to exonerate them, these were by any definition adults. I kept thinking that, well, maybe if more than one of them actually had a job they wouldn't have had so much time on their hands to feel miserable and dissipate. As for them being a, to quote Gertrude Stein, \\"Lost Generation\\" robbed of meaning by war, it was made clear that so many of these characters began their lives of irresponsibility well before the outbreak of the First World War.<br /><br />Furthermore this novel was not a story, it was a series of loosely connected situations. In my opinion, Fitzgerald, Hemingway's contemporary, wrote rings around Hemingway, as did several other writers of the period I could name. Also for a man who won the Nobel Prize, Hemingway's habit of mixing past and present tenses (I'm talking about in his prose, not character dialogue) surprised me. To all the English teachers out there who used to get on my case for committing this compositional error, I'd like to ask, if mixing tenses is bad writing, then why did this author win the Nobel Prize, and if he won the Nobel Prize mixing tenses, then why is it bad writing?<br /><br />I do not wish to give the impression I loathed The Sun Also Rises, because I didn't. I did enjoy the frank exchange of views between this novel's characters on issues of race, religion, and general ethos, their use of epithets verboten today, and the politics of sexual congress, but that alone did not carry the plot to conclusion, and too much fell too limply by. Truthfully, the novel is about expatriate drunks who go on holiday to Spain to watch bulls be slaughtered by a young man after whom the central female character lusts. As for the dialogue, anyone who finds depth in the conversations the characters have is inventing that depth himself. There was simply not much here to latch onto.<br /><br />Honestly, The Sun Also Rises is all right, but it isn't brilliant literature, and the only way it defined any generation is in the corrective touch of wishful hindsight.ngway, as did several other writers of the period I could name.

0582417775|5.0|THE CLIENT is one of my favorite books.  It is superbly entertaining and immensely engrossing book that you aren't able to put down at all.  Plus, it has constant emotional depth that leads to the unexpectedly tear-jerking ending.   I won't tell you about the plot, since you can get that elsewhere.  I'm writing this so you will read this book.    Many of the complaints from other customers are about the fact that this book seems made to film.  True, it does, but it's not anywhere near the point to where it lacks any depth.  The characters are perfectly developed, and the dialouge is snappy and smart.  Every part of the book is utterly thrilling and the entire 566 page book is a fast, enjoyable ride.   Highly recommended.
B00006IUL7|5.0|2002's \\"Insomnia\\" is one of the most quietly melancholy American movies I've ever seen--all the characters (with the exception of Hillary Swank's annoyingly idealistic female detective Ellie Burr) are somehow grimy and have something to hide.<br /><br />Robin Williams plays a really good creep.  \\"One Hour Photo\\" was a movie with a lot of potential that ultimately went nowhere, but he sure makes up for it here as the effeminate failed writer and murderer of a 17 year old girl. Williams successfully underplays the role of a neurotic psychopath (Walter Finch) whose pathos we see emerge in the smallest and most pivotal moments, thereby making them even more disturbing.<br /><br />The cinematography is damn near perfect--the Alaskan wilderness is a perfect backdrop for Det Will Dormer's (Al Pacino) psychological meltdown and inability to sleep.  The time zone and his entire life is closing in on him slowly: a previous investigation in which he planted evidence to convict another child killer is beginning to catch up with him.  On top of this, his younger partner (Martin Donovan) is forced to make a deal with internal affairs about the matter.  As if things could get worse, he accidentally shoots and kills him in a foggy gun battle where Finch is lurking.<br /><br />He is then forced to sink so low as to collaborate with Finch himself, who orchestrated the incident precisely for control of not only his fate but Dormer's.  The whole theme of dishonesty, even in the service of a just cause, gracefully winds around Dormer's neck like a noose.  The ending is as devastating as the entire film, with Swank's character given  the hope of redemption out of all this corruption.  A must see.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Seriously. I've seen many movies in my day, but none of them (including a certain one about a witch) made me ever look away because I though I'd be nauseous. Seriously, when you have to close your eyes to stop them from straining, something is wrong.<br /><br />With crappy hand-held realism aside, the movie characters and story were a letdown. I know a lot of it was about this viral marketing rah rah, but who cares ultimately when the movie is dumb?<br /><br />First of all, the initial scene at the party feature some of the most crappy dialog and scenes to date. I almost fell asleep with how dumb it was. Then when things got moving, the people who we follow on their stupid quest through the city get even dumber! They feel it's perfectly fine to go towards the destruction and to walk under a mega-huge creature that's killing people left and right.<br /><br />The guy running the camera is one of the most annoying characters in history. He kept saying \\"Rob! Rob! Rob! Rob! Rob!\\" over and over. I wanted him to be slapped repeatedly. When they finally get to their final destination, the story keeps up with it's dumbness. A girl impaled? Oh she's fine!<br /><br />The movie utterly crappy elements could not be redeemed, for me, by anything they put on screen.

B00154GEFU|4.0|A lot has already been said by fans of this band.  The consensus of oppinion is that whilst everyone was delighted at the news of the four original members getting back together and doing a tour the new album has attracted mixed reviews from fans.  For me this is an album of two haves. There are elments of both John's solo carrier in this album and the music of Asia of old.  I feel you have to like both to like this album.  A lot of people wanted the original Asia album - the sequal.  However I feel had they done that it wouldn't have worked so well.  They'd have treaded on past glories. This album reminds me more of Alpha ( my personal favourite of the Asia albums). The John Payne era Asia will always be a different band to me.  I don't like Silent Nation.  My favourite album by that band was Aura or Aria.  Let us hope they decided to stay together and make another album.  We can therefore see this as a Phoenix, the beginning of a wonderful new chapter in this amazing band carrier.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I went to the movies to see this. From all the hype on it and the pre-release of it, I thought it would be better than The Godzilla movie with Matthew Broderick.It was beyond terrible. I wanted, and the 3 people with me wanted, the moronic kids at the party to be the first to go (or get eaten, disposed of, killed) they had no lives, no talent. We could not believe: That the star was a V.P. of a company in Japan at his age, the head of the Statue of Liberty was so small.. The filming was done by a kid under 5 (solar years) old and not very well at that. They kept moving erratically so much I became seasick (on dry land in the movie theater)! The actors and actresses' names kept changing or were being mispronounced all through the film. I was so angry at the low quality and terrible filming, I went out to the manager and demanded my money back. I think that we should have been paid a reasonable wage for having to sit through such drivel! I am stunned that they made this into a DVD and they have the gall to charge for it! Unbelievable! I cannot recommend it to anyone, I don't dislike anyone that badly. The only other film I thought was close to this was Ishtar, but Cloverfield is worse by 100 times!
1577311523|5.0|Before you become utterly perplexed by the wide range of both positive and negative  reviews, you must realize that just as Eckhart says many times - this book is meaningless to those will not experience consciousness because of it. The only way you can truly know is by reading it for yourself.     As for myself, this book resonated on a level I have never felt before. Far beyond intellectual understanding, I feel Eckhart's teachings are true rather than believing they are. Yes, it's message is repetitive; yet no more than it needs be. In terms of change and self improvement, there is a world of difference between understanding a concept and truly \\"getting it\\". Sometimes, a repeated message is what you need to get it.    The words in this book only point to a truth, they are not it. It cannot be understood by the mind because it can't be conceptualized; it can't be turned in to an image and labeled. For those who seek to understand it with thought, it is utterly meaningless.     I recommended to try it out for yourself. Even the possibility of understanding the signposts Eckhart offers is worth the investment.
B000O179FO|5.0|Excellent Blu Ray disc. The movie itself is outstanding!!! If you have a Blu Ray player, this movie is worth adding to your collection.
0060090367|1.0|I thought this book was terrible.  It was an absolutley typical story about love and loss - done 1000 times over.  There were so many little sub stories that began to develop, only to disappear and never be seen again in the story (i.e. the crazy gardener).  The ending was SO predictable.  Frankly I can't believe anyone agreed to publish this piece of garbage.  Don't waste your time!
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I would recommend this movie to any of the stargate fans out there. It wrapped up the Ori arc in the show. Also has plenty of action. Don't miss it.
0739337270|5.0|Allan Corduner does a masterful job of reading The Book Thief. His voices for Hans, Rosa, Max and Death are especially wonderful. Whether you are a fan of this book or have yet to read it, listening to it is a treat (especially if you don't speak German and aren't sure how to say the names and phrases).
B000ZLFALI|3.0|I was expecting an extravaganza. After all, we're talking about The Beatles' music here. Well, in a way, it was. There are over 30 Beatles songs used for the music and almost every element in the film (from the characters' names and dialogue) was derived from The Beatles material. And yet, it still doesn't cut it for me.    The film centers on the love story between Jude (Jim Sturgess) - a blue-collar teenager from Liverpool who jumped ship to America to find his long lost G.I. father who didn't know about him, and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) - a sheltered high schooler whose boyfriend was drafted (and eventually killed) for the Vietnam War. Set in the 60s New York, amid the war, activism, hippie lifestyle and rock music - every symbol that represents the era was conspicuously present, just as the cookie cutter characters were. The activist, the artist, the musicians, the commune, the privileged Princeton-educated kids who'd rather drive taxis, psychedelic musical numbers, pink-colored buses, bare breasts, riots. Plug in cameos of no less than Bono, Salma Hayek and Joe Cocker, among others, and yet it still doesn't cut it for me.    The movie became too preoccupied with style, I guess, that it left substance behind. The musical arrangements were okay, the cast's vocals were impressive. There were even high points like the Gospel rendition of \\"Let It Be\\" and Wood's \\"If I Fell\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" (better than Sarah Maclachlan's!). But it lacked heart, somehow -the lead actors were really pretty, but they failed to show the passion that the music deserved. And perhaps the feeling that everything was contrived to fit in the lackluster story failed to make the music move me. I am not a die-hard fan of the Beatles but \\"I Am Sam\\" became one of my favorite soundtracks. \\"Across The Universe\\" - hardly. In fact, if I were a Beatles fan, I would most likely been furious at this sacrilege.    All in all - its good intentions aside, I did not feel the movie's soul - not of the music, not of the spirit of the 60s, not even the love story's. If there's anything that touched me, it's Jude and Max's friendship, and the emotionally charged yet funny dinner conversation:    Max: Why is it always about \\"what will you do\\"? Do, do, do, do, do. Why isn't the issue here who I am?  Uncle Teddy: Because, Maxwell, what you do defines who you are.  Max: No, Uncle Teddy. Who you are defines what you do. Right, Jude?  Jude: Well, surely it's not what you do, but the, uh... the way that you do it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is the only movie i have ever watched where every time i watch it, i am amazed at how fantastic of a movie is.  If i had the money i would buy two copies so i could watch it on two tv at the same time. i recommend this movie to everybody, even people who dont like SiFi movies. If you like Firefly, the tv series that Serenity was based off of, then you will love this movie.
B00000K19E|5.0|I've enjoyed the segments I've seen of this movie, but had yet to see the whole thing.  Visually, this movie cannot be beat.<br /><br />Also, I think Marcus Chong deserved more notable billing for his portrayal as Tank.  He made the movie, in my opinion.<br /><br />The directing is great.  The angle shown of the agent dodging bullets differed from the hero doing the same thing, and this added to the suspense and the concern for the hero.<br /><br />The story is a bit on the dark side, without one conclusively knowing who survived except for Neo (Keanu Reeves).  This movie had spiritual overtones that I want to comment on.<br /><br />In an internet group I'm on, someone compared this movie with the Chronicles of Narnia, and said this movie was more Christian than Lewis' classic series.  Having seen the movie, I really disagree.<br /><br />This movie fits into a relativistic mindset.  There are no absolutes.  The oracle told Neo \\"what he needed to hear\\", but that turned out to be a lie.  Neo definitely fits into a substitute Messiah, having skills the others do not have.  The ideal, though, is to be antinomian, that is, without rules.  This is contrary to Biblical Christianity.<br /><br />Just my thoughts.

B0013FBS20|5.0|This movie in my estimation was a dissapointment.  Everything leading up to the ending was making for a great movie, but the theatrical ending was such a weak ending.  Thankfully this Blu ray disc has a much better ending than the theatrical version.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  The video quality of this Blu ray disc is the best thats out there.  This is absolutely a demo disc for Blu ray.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|This is a great, great album.  Why?  Because among other things I love John Lennon, the Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd,, 70's fusion, and music in which melody is strong.  But this is not apeing.  My first Wilco album, this is where I enter the fold.  Very accessible and warm, but at the same time challenging, unexpected, sophisticated with moments of frightening dissonance. Fun, easy, and subtle and dark.  Great music and movies always spawn controversy; that is one of the measures. Can't wait for another Wilco album with Nels Cline on guitar!   Wow.  I'm 50, and it is heartening that rock music continues to grow and mature.  No end in sight...makes me smile.
0394720288|5.0|This has to be among the best of Wodehouse. As so many other reviewers have remarked, the novel has a fluid feel to it; total and complete chaos. Starting with an ominous phone call from Aunt Dahlia, Bertie jumps from bowl to bowl constantly in the soup.<br /><br />I loved the quotes from this book, on things being gruntled and what not. The characters are also amazing. Sir Watkyn Bassett, the treacly Madeleine, with Spode running after Bertie wanting to break his bones, the dog Bartholomew (this was perhaps one place where I almost laughed out loud) which terrorizes Bertie and Jeeves when (I think) they have to take shelter on top of the cupboard-Bertie goes to great lengths introducing this terrier. The moment is when they throw a candle at Bartholomew and it eats it.<br /><br />The cow creamer plays no small part in the plot. It is a hideous silver jug that uncle Tom collects. Aunt Dahlia wants Bertie to 'sneer' at it by saying that its modern dutch, which might lower its value, apparently.<br /><br />There is also Stephanie Byng and stinker Pinker who constantly trips over things. And constable dobbs, Aunt Dahlia herself, and Gussie Fink Nottle. There couldn't have been a more ridiculous set of characters than here.<br /><br />This,and perhaps some of the Pig books (Pigs have wings, and Summer Lightning come readily to mind). I wish the world were as nice as that depicted by Wodehouse.
0743298039|5.0|I love love love this book! I cannot put it down! This book is for the person who loves to read and appreciates books. It's a romantic tale about the structure of family relationships and how they affect your whole world. I love the mysteries within mysteries in this book. I cannot get enough of it and I am letting all my fellow readers borrow it. If you love mystery, adventure, disfuntional families and reading- you will love this book! I will defintely add more Diane Setterfield to my wish list!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|The final TV show left much to be desired.  This final show/movie wraps up the ten years in an acceptable way.  It would have been nice to see Jack O'Neil make one last appearance for old times sake.  It was expected that a hook for possible future sequels was included at the very end.  SG-1 managed to keep my attention for the shows entire run and that is a difficult task at best.  Congratulation to the writers, production staff and the actors for a job well done.
0786939532|5.0|I was never much for reading because most books could not keep my attention.  This book however grabbed my attention and held it.  Cleverly written, entertaining, with descriptive visuals that bring the story to life, Homeland, along with the other books in this series, is non-stop action.  I highly recommend this book!!!  I have since read the rest of the trilogy and I am currently reading The Crystal Shard, which is the beginning of the next trilogy.
032147404X|5.0|This book is fantastic. It must be the bible for anyone who starts to shoot. The results are much, much better than I expected. Thanks to Scott for sharing his experience.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Do yourself a favor and stop reading reviews and just listen to tracks \\"Ties That Bind\\", \\"Buried Alive\\", and the new-classic titular \\"Blackbird\\".  Once you see what these guys are about, owning and loving this album becomes a no-brainer.    Ignore any reference to the \\"C\\" word and just take these guys as the talented musicians they are and listen to the soaring vocals of one of the most talented singers with the broadest range I've ever heard.    As a music vet living in Nashville - trust me when I say this is how rock is supposed to sound.  Kudos, Alter Bridge - and thank you.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I always watch a video before actually working out along with it so I have an idea as to the intensity of the workout.  When I watched this one I thought it was going to be a breeze because the workout in Level 1 is made up of very simple moves that anyone can do (push-ups, squats, jumping jacks, etc.).  However, the next morning when I popped in the DVD, I was hitting pause every few minutes because it was a killer (and I'm used to doing cardio & the Biggest Loser DVD workouts)!  The combination of moves Jillian's uses in this workout work a wide range of muscles and you can definately feel your body changing.  With her 3-2-1 system, you are sore but don't really focus on it because she goes from strength to cardio to abs without skipping a beat. Since I was so sore from the first workout, I rested a day before my next Jillian's beating and I'm glad to say that I haven't had to hit pause since the first day. I'll be moving on to the next level soon and will be ready for my next beating!  :)    The downsides:  1-You can't fast forward to get directly to the workout. 2-Even though it claims to be a 20 minute workout, it's closer to 30.
0061122416|5.0|I totally love this book!  Not only did it help me to realize the truth of my life, but it has allowed me to help others understand what's happening in their lives.  I recommend this book to anyone - even those of us that feel we know what we're doing.

B000T2OMX0|5.0|Writing reviews for classical arrangements is a bit impractical; tastes for interpretations will vary as widely as the availability of arrangements themselves.  Instead, I strive to write my reviews on the quality of the actual recording and arrangement leaving out personal tastes.    That being said, this is a splendid collection of Bach's cello suites.  Recording quality is near impeccable and tuneful.  I detected little to no background noise minus the occasional and expected bow resonance.   A superb arrangement to which one can truly enjoy the dulcet tones of the cello.    The warmth and quality of the arrangement can be somewhat attributed to the fact Queyras is performing with the loaned Gioffredo Cappa cello crafted in 1696.
B00154GEFU|3.0|Wow, these music masters must have had some long miserable years since the good ole days!  The lyrics are terribly depressing.  Rather than the Phoenix rising from the flames, this is more akin to Icarus flying into the flames.  Disappointing, although it was the very first CD I purchased from Amazon that did not arrive with a damaged jewel case.
B00005JLD4|4.0|Three young girls are forced to leave their mothers in 1931 and move to the Moore River Native Settlement: Australia's aboriginal equivalent to the U.S.'s Native American relocation attempts. They refuse to remain there, however, and begin an epic 1,500 mile trek across Australia, following the \\"rabbit proof fence\\" as they are relentlessy tracked by a pair of hired men.<br /><br />What Rabbit Proof Fence does is create in the viewer a sense of familiarity with the main characters, so much so that you will likely consider yourself a fourth member of this little band of persistent travelers. In the end, I found myself deeply engrossed in these little girls and could not turn away as I was completely invested in watching the outcome of their journey.<br /><br />This is one of the better films I saw last year and a top 50 independent film. Story-wise it's tremendous and musically it's superb (soundtrack by Peter Gabriel).
B000YMBBH0|5.0|Now that HD-DVD will no longer be available, I bought this collection too soon.  Wait for the HD-DVD fire sales to begin.
B000E8QVWY|1.0|I struggled to sit through the majority of the DVD. I finally gave up the ghost during the scene where Cash's wife left him. I did not find this either entertaining or inspiring and was actually left with a very bad impression of Johnny Cash... very disappointed. The actors did do a good job, it just was not a good story. As I told my husband, \\"Now that was 2+ hours of my life that I will never get back.\\"
0385338724|5.0|It was laugh-out loud funny and left me wanting more.  This was a great change from Shopaholic, but definitely showed its relation.  You couldn't ask for better characters from Sophie Kinsella.  I couldn't believe the twists, and loved the ending.  I think the ending could have been stretched a little bit for more enjoyment, but all good things must come to an end.  Will there be a sequal?  Could Lexi and Jon share joint business ventures with building and home decor?
0439813786|5.0|I bought this book for my 8-year old and he loves it, and I love it and everyone else in the family...it's clever, drawings are great, story unique, it's truly engaging for a young boy who is a bit bored with reading usually. Thoroughly recommend it!

B00000GUZP|5.0|These days, it is practically de rigeur for stars like Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, Madonna or Gwen Stefani to hook up with Timbaland, or Pharrell or will.i.am, but back in 1981, it wasn't common for an established white star to hook up with a black music producer, especially one from a punk rock group. That was exactly what happened when Blondie front woman Debbie Harry decided to release her solo debut. After the success of her band's last album \\"Autoamerican\\" (which had two US #1 hits in \\"Rapture\\" and \\"The tide is high\\"), Debbie gave Chic frontmen Nile Rogers and Bernard Edwards a call and the result was \\"Koo koo\\".<br /><br />The album comprised ten songs, four written by Rogers & Edwards, four written by Harry and her Blondie partner Chris Stein, and two written in collaboration with Rogers and Edwards. The cover art was an attempt to ditch her Blondie persona and was rather startling; a brunette Harry with giant metal skewers drilled through her face, and that was just the front cover. The inner sleeve photo looked even more alien with some robotic textures to her skin. I just knew I had to hide the record from view each time my mum went past, or else she would have taken righteous delight in destroying that \\"demonic record\\".<br /><br />And the music? An attempt at the sonic variety Blondie had experimented with on \\"Autoamerican\\" but with an emphasis on dance/funk. The songs penned by Rogers & Edwards were the scratchy disco/funk Chic were known for; lead-off single \\"Backfired\\" a #43 US hit (and featuring a rap by Rogers, well before anyone else was doing it), the incredibly funky hand clap filled \\"The jam was moving\\" #82 in the US (and telling the funny story of a quest by the F.B.I. to find out just what it was in the music that had people all over the nation dancing, set to a skeletal bassline), \\"Surrender\\" (with a wicked guitar solo at the end), and the beautiful jazzy ballad \\"Now I know you know\\" with crystal clear vocals by Harry in her upper register (and a lovely guitar/sax coda). I've always loved Rogers & Edwards brilliant ballads like \\"Savoir faire\\" (Chic), \\"Now that you're gone\\" (Diana Ross) and \\"I'm a good girl\\" (Sister Sledge) to mention a few, and this is along those lines.<br /><br />The four co-written with Stein included the opening razor sharp pop/funk \\"Jump jump\\" (a silly tale about her little doggie set to an incredibly groovy bassline), the slow chugging rock of \\"Chrome\\", the reggae \\"Inner city spillover\\" (again, with very silly abstract lyrics about a lady who had a brick fall on her bed while in bed, but with an incredible dub bassline), and the horrid \\"Military rap\\" (another attempt at Rap by Harry after \\"Rapture\\" which was very good and groovy).<br /><br />The pair written with Rogers & Edwards comprise the brief rock burst \\"Under arrest\\" and the Middle Eastern tinged \\"Oasis\\" (the title of the album was taken from the lyrics of this song).<br /><br />There was a reluctance by radio to play songs off the album which Nile Rogers ascribed to racism, but the album managed to be certified Gold in the US and hit #28 in the US and #6 in the UK. I loved this album and was rather worried I wouldn't be able to get in on CD but what do you know, here it is with two bonus extended versions of \\"Backfired\\" (rather redundant in my opinion) and \\"The jam was moving\\" (now, this I like, as the original ran just under 3 minutes).<br /><br />Critics usually slag off this album but hey, what do they know. After this, Nile Rogers would go on to produce more pop and rock acts like Madonna (\\"Like a virgin\\"), The B-52s (\\"Cosmic thing\\"), Duran Duran (\\"Notorious\\") and David Bowie (\\"Let's dance\\") among others.guitar/sax coda).

B00006SFLV|4.0|One of the greatest shows that molded a generation...on DVD! I was just in Target and saw another box set of the series, but this was the first. We relived all the teen angst and all the agony of high school all over again in it's glory. Whether you get it here or anywhere, the full series of My So Called Life is an excellent series that takes an honest look at the life of high schoolers in the 1990s. (Sort of the anti-Saved By the Bell.)
B0010358D0|2.0|I felt the animation was very well done.  What brought the movie down for me were the long moments of NO ACTION filled instead with long moments of boring dialouge.  The whole \\"being posessed\\" idea has been done too many times before and seemed like an easy way out when it came to creating the plot for this movie.  The main character says Riorios so many times they should have put a count at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />PROS:  Great animation<br />CONS: Unengaging storyline<br />  Long moments without any action
B000WGWQG8|4.0|Since I am working on a Masters degree with a focus on early America, specifically the revolutionary years and the early republic, I found the series to do a comendable job of portraying the life of Adams. David McCullough is a first rate writer and his obvious respect for the darker side of the revolutionary period is nice to see. The process of American freedom was complicated and far less heroic then your basic elementary school unit would like to suggest. Our founding generation had the same human faults we see in ourselves. In my own research, I am often asked how I think the founding generation would react to the America of today. The honest answer is that they would not know any better than we do. They were an extraordinary group of men, but they were so in their time and place. Our modern world would be completely foreign to them. However, I think that Adams would be pleased the way this depiction of the history of the revolution exposes his weaknesses along with his strengths. We must appreciate where we have come from, but remember that each generation is a unique human creation. I would recommend this as a good place to start for those of you who would like to know more about the early history of the United States.
0375842209|5.0|I thought I was going to hate this book. If my book club hadn't selected it that particular month, I would never have picked it up. Despite my doubts, I checked it out of my local library and gave it a go.     The first pages were difficult because I was so put off by the strange premise of having the events narrated by Death, and by the unusual phrasing and word choices. But somewhere along the way I got sucked into the story. I began to realize that the phrasing and word choices were brilliant, arresting, moving. By the end of the book, I realized this story had to be told by Death, that this was part of its power. Death was the constant outsider, \\"haunted by humans,\\" a witness of every kind of depravity and nobility. By the end of the book, I knew it was one of the finest I had ever read. Months and months later, I am still moved to tears when I think of some of the characters and the things Death said about them.     I agree with those who are mystified at this being classified as YA. Not that young adults wouldn't understand or enjoy this book, but that it's fully complex, original, and polished enough to stand with the best \\"literary\\" books out there.    I feel a re-read coming on. Maybe this time I'll buy my own copy so it'll be there when I need it.
0061150142|4.0|Per usual, a good book by Jodi Picoult. She is a very good writer and pulls you in despite the rather depressing themes her books surround.
B00006M183|5.0|Helped to begin to heal what was then an open wound from 9/11 (\\"I Am Mine\\" in particular).  Though not always uplifting, it really reflected what was going on at the time.  And it still holds up (as do all of Pearl Jams albums).  \\"Can't Keep\\" gets better with every listen.    Awesome album from start to finish.

B00006AVRK|5.0|With all due respect to Monty Python, the Goon Squad and Ricky Gervais, there was never a funnier Brit than P.G. Wodehouse. And here you can immerse yourself in his greatest creations--Wooster and Jeeves. My wife and I have regularly wended our ways through these delicious and droll comedies, ever since they first appeared on PBS 17 years ago. Been through the series six or eight times so far. The earlier episodes tend to be stronger. Because of these shows, we find ourselves unable to watch Hugh Laurie on House and take him seriously--because we know that somewhere inside that irascible, misanthropic M.D. is a sweet, inept, clumsy British twit.

B00003ZKRM|4.0|Sir John Barbirolli (1899-1970) established the greatness of Mancester's Halle' Orchestra during his 28 years as their principal conductor from his 1943 appointment to his 1970 death. An London of Cockney birth, Barbirolli was linked to relatively few composers in his long career with Sibelius being one of those he most loved. His style was to personalize music, not merely to condcut it. While not as wayward in style as the likes of Leopold Stokowski or Nikolaus Harnoncourt, who could (and do) infuriate listeners with their personalizations, Barbirolli was more akin to Leonard Bernstein.<br /><br />As he showed in his highly personal recordings of the Beethoven \\"Eroica\\" symphony and Elgar's Symphony No. 2, Barbirolli conducted with relatively slow tempi and asked his orchestra to voice the music differently than others. Both those characteristics are apparent in these recordings of the seven Sibelius symphonies and extracts from his other orchestral works.<br /><br />I bought this set especially to hear what Barbirolli would do with the Symponies 3, 4 and 6 -- especially the latter of the trio. I am pleased to say Barbirolli is as good an exponent of the symphonies as the other reviewers here would lead you to believe. He focused on the woodwind voicing more so than the strings or brass, giving these often quiet and introspective scores a slightly different sound world than other conductors. He is just as good in the bigger and more romantic Symphonies 1, 2 and 5, as well, with his rendering of Symphony 2 being a special triumph.<br /><br />I can't say I was as impressed by all the other music in this box as some around here. In particular the first disk of the set that includes the warhorses Finlandia, Karelia suite, Swan of Tuonela and Lemminkainen's Return, were not as propulsive or effective as recordings I've heard from other conductors incluidng Ormandy. Still, they add a lot to your understanding of both the way Barbirolli views this composer and your appreciation of the Halle' Orchestra, whose members play exceptionally throughtout.<br /><br />For me, this was my first exposure to some of the other music recorded here including the Scenes Historiques and Rakastava selections. With early opus numbers (25 and 14, respectively) these come from the composer's earlier romantic days before the Russian takeover and his own drinking turned him -- and his later music -- somber and moody. While Sibelius represent an icier Scandanavian landscape in later opi, these represent the romantic Fin at his best.<br /><br />The symphonies are the main course on this menu and they are universally pleasing to the ear, head and heart in this recordings made in London's Kingsway Hall. This collection lets you know what a splendid conductor Barbirolli was, what a splendid orchestra he developed in the Halle', and what a wonderful recording venue was Kingsway Hall. All things considered, aside from a few disappointments, this is a cherishable collection.estra, whose members play exceptionally throughtout.

6304936362|5.0|Cheesy, corny, predictable, etc. Whatever you say about this film might be right... yet, it is a great movie, that transports you to the actual story of the guys and allows you to enjoy rather than suffer (although war is nothing to enjoy, ever) and gives you a positive feeling at the end. I've watched it at least ten times, and still enjoy it.
B000BC8STM|5.0|This is a treasure for Cher collectors of all ages.  There are actually two concerts on this dvd!  First, there is the CBS special, then there is a specail feature on the dvd that allows you to watch the \\"rehearsal\\" of the cbs special.  Cher in her normal everyday wear and sounding fabulous.  Only drawback is the video footage of the rehearsal show is not professional, but it is a keepsake for CHER fans everywhere!  A must have.  There are also extras; crew footage describing Cher in food terms, commercial for the tour, etc.

0618918248|5.0|Honestly, this is probably one of the most brilliant, eye-opening books available today. Where a majority of Americans supposedly claim the Bible (a book of fiction) is their favorite book, this should clear a lot of things up for them.     I'm a former Catholic (born and raised) and much of what Dawkins writes is what I've felt and thought for many, many years. It's such a shame how strong a grip religion has in the US, especially during the past 8 years. It's sickening. The problem is most people react angrily to having their core beliefs challenged, especially when it comes to religion. That's where you see the 1 and 2-star rankings here. There are just a lot of people who refuse to open their minds and will attack such works as this every chance they get. I feel sorry for those people.     Anyway, this is a free country (again, in some ways you certainly wouldn't think so any more), so everyone is free to express an opinion on this book. For fellow Atheists, this is a refreshing read as it brings a TON of clarity to Atheism and the state of religion in the world.     For those of you who are \\"believers,\\" I just say read this with an open mind and don't take offense to what's said. If you can't question religion and your particular faith simply because that's all you've known since birth, well, then I guess you have deeper issues. You will grow more as a person if you learn to question things. You'll become a wiser person for it.
0618918248|5.0|Great book. Here a summary:  Open minds (Evidence-based decision making) = ok  Closed minds (Superstition-based decision making) = not ok    Of course, since closed minds are by definition unreachable, reading this book is a waste of time for any \\"believer\\". Only recommended if your mind still works in the above sense.
0316067598|2.0|Marcus Luttrell has endured hardships that better than 99% of America never will.  His service should serve as an example to all Americans and the world as a testament to the better angels of our nature.  That being said, I can't say that I've ever read a book (even a ghostwritten one) by someone who was more in love with themself.  It reminded me most of Bravo Two-Zero, which was a book written by Andy McNabb, an SAS'r, about his experiences in Gulf War 1.  No doubt SEALs are squared-away (although if you read \\"Not A Good Day To Die\\" by Sean Naylor, about Operation Anaconda, you don't come away with a positive opinion about the SEALs).  I just think that this important story could have focused more on Luttrell's buddies who will never get to tell their stories than on how tough Marcus is and how great Texas is.
B000ZN803G|5.0|One of the BEST movies I have seen ALL year!!!  Dramatic, grabs the heart and never lets go.  Highly recommend!!!
B000A2UBN4|5.0|The very logic of the film is quite common (Stephen King or Richard Bachman among many others have used it in his novel Thinner). A criminal is sentenced to a long term in prison but the sentence is all the longer because the criminal's lawyer decided that since his client was guilty he could forget some important element that would have changed the length of the prison term. The prisoner gets out of prison one day and comes back to haunt the lawyer and get his vengeance. That's when the film gets particularly nasty and the lawyer reveals himself quite ugly when fear grasps his guts, revealing the little trust he has in justice and the police. And sure enough the end will be positive for that ugly character of a lawyer who deserved to really suffer and die. But that's when Scorsese plays with our nerves and makes the lawyer's daughter fall in love with the criminal for all the bad reasons you can imagine but then she will turn nasty with him for all the good reasons you may find. In other words everything is upside down and nothing will ever bring them back upside up because what counts is what we have in our minds and memories and not what the world believes. A great small little film that does hold us in suspense and apprehension.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
1400049628|3.0|ok the concept is ingenious regardless of whether you like the final product or not. the joke in of it self is the fact that the book is a \\"SERIOUS\\" zombie survival guide manual. admittedly it probably wears thin and don't fully  justify the whole book as humor. but then again i don't think max ever intended to be OBVIOUSLY tongue in cheek. i think he genuinely wanted it to be serious in tone for the most part. people just assumed it would be more blatantly satirical because of max brooks comedic back ground. so in essence this review is more about how well max pulled off the authenticity instead of whether or not he pulled off humor.<br /><br />be that as it may, the book is still interesting if not completely enjoyable. the books instructions are interesting, but honestly most of them are common sense tactics that should be used in any emergency situation. and in fact should already be known. but common sense is not so common so i'l let max slide on this.<br /><br />the instructions themselves varies and are very detailed but honestly they're written in such a mundane matter of fact tone that you find yourselves just skimming through them. but he does achieve his goal in making it seem like a real manual...and it shows lol<br /><br />i did find some of the mythos kinda problematic, and maybe even contradictory.. but nothing too huge. the meat of the manual (at least for me) is actually the \\"historical accounts\\" of past zombie outbreaks. unlike some others i found them to be the entertaining part of the book. and i even found some of the accounts to be surprisingly bone chilling.<br /><br />the book is kinda tedious, but thats part of the gimmick. you either like it or you don't. if your looking for some overt humor then no this isn't for you. in fact the manual is played straight all the way through. as a concept its brilliant despite not being heavy on \\"replay value\\". this is a must have for zombie buffs.
B00006CXSS|5.0|A gritty and honest depiction of life as a soldier in World War II.  I first saw this series on the History channel and no matter how many times I have seen it, I never grow tired of watching it.  I finally decided to purchase the set so I can watch the original uncensored version along with all of the extras (the interviews with surviving members and Ron Livingston's video diary are great).  I am loaning it out to all of my friends and co-workers so they can see this excellent series and have a renewed appreciation for what has been called \\"the greatest generation\\".  My only quibble is not with the series, but with the packaging - getting the DVDs released from their holders is a bit of a challenge.  Other than that, I highly recommend this item to everyone.
B000JLTRKE|1.0|Firstly let me say that I disagree with Hollywood making movies and money out of what happened at 9/11. To me its human nature at its worst.<br /><br />Sure we need to always remember what happened, never forget the thousands who lost their lives and the hundreds who courageously strived to save others. But this we can do in the many documentaries created, did we really need this film. I for one will never forget the televised scenes as the news broke on that fateful day.<br /><br />The movie is simply poor. It focuses on 2 policemen who were trapped underground, and the stress and tension they and their families all went through.<br /><br />I believe the film was made in a rush to get it to market quickly. The choice of just 2 nypd families (37 died) to focus on is a poor choice considering the heroism of the NY fire department (343 died) that day.<br /><br />The film misses out in so many ways, such as not showing the planes, very limited view of the collapse of the towers.<br /><br />Its hard to make a movie on such a subject, and easy for a reviewer like me to criticise, but the film reminded me of the Poisiden adventure.<br /><br />Its a poor film that does not succeed in what it sets out to do in showing the courage, bravery and sacrifice of the many hundreds of men and woman who ventured into towers 1 and 2 of the world trade centre while everyone else was trying to get out.
0790744295|5.0|Creepshow is 1982 Anthology Horror movie directed by George Romero and written by Stephen King. It stars Stephen King, Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, Leslie Nielsen, Ted Danson, E.G.Marshall, and Ed Harris. It contains five stories: \\"Father's Day\\", \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\\", \\"Something to Tide You Over\\", \\"The Crate\\" and \\"They're Creeping Up on You!\\". Two of these stories, \\"The Crate\\" and \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\\" (originally titled \\"Weeds\\") are previously published King short stories. It's considered a sleeper hit at the box-office amongst horror fans, considering it made $21 Million Dollars domestically. The film itself serves as a homage to EC Comics' Tale from the Crypt, The Vault of Horror & The Haunt of Fear.<br /><br />These days, this movie can be found in bargain bins everywhere where movies are sold and is a good buy, if you ask me. It's another one of my favorites. One I recommend to all.
B0000509C4|4.0|This followup to Creepshow was directed by Michael Gornick (who was George A. Romero's cinematographer on the original Creepshow). The screenplay was written by George A. Romero(Night of the Living Dead fame) and based on three short stories by Stephen King(\\"Old Chief Wood'nHead\\", \\"The Raft\\", and \\"The Hitch-Hiker\\"). It stars George Kennedy, Dorothy Lamour, Holt McCallany and Don Harvey.<br /><br />It is considered an even better movie than the first according to some horror fans. I, personally, thought it was on par with the first film.<br /><br />It, too, can be found in bargain bins anywhere movies are sold and is a good buy if you're into Anthology Horror movies. I loved it myself.
B00065MDS6|5.0|This is one of Crimson's forgotten and misunderstood albums.  I've always really like it.  It's extremely gentle for the most part, with just enough outbreaks of cacophony for us long time fans (especially on the song Happy Family).  The band was in great flux at this time (Robert Fripp was the only consistent member of the band since its inception, and the album was written in its entirety by Fripp and lyricist Pete Sinfield), but you couldn't really tell from the album itself.  I really like the exquisite musical interplay going on here, especially in Andy McCulloch's drumming.  He's playing very complicated structures, but somehow it's very gentle and light.  Lizard is softer than most Crimson albums, and it's still as intricate and as complex as anything they put out, but it's not as showy as other albums.  I really like Cirkus, the first song, and I absolutely love the title track, an epic masterpiece and the longest song Crimson has yet to record.  The opening movement, Prince Rupert Awakes, has a great lead vocal by Jon Anderson of Yes (a band Fripp almost joined), and the rest of the song moves from this beautiful first movement.<br /><br />If you're just getting into Crimson, this may not be the place to start, but if you dig them, you should really pick this one up.
B000002LVB|4.0|If this was an album by any other band, it would be considered a masterpiece.  But it is a Velvet Underground album, and when you compare it to their first three albums, it's not as good as they are.  But on its own terms, it's still has many wonderful tracks in it, and it's a classic album.  Just because it's not as good as the other three doesn't mean it should be dismissed, like some Velvet fans have done (and even Lou Reed has had mixed feelings about it).  True, the band was disintegrating by this time.  Maureen Mo Tucker wasn't on this album (even though she's listed in the credits), and she's missed.  Billy Yule, Doug Yule's brother, plays on this album.  He is a decent drummer, but he's no Maureen Tucker.  Reed left just as they finished this album, and the back cover is really kind of an insult, only featuring Doug Yule at a piano in the studio.  Reed said that the songs were remixed and restructured without his permission, etc., etc..<br /><br />The album has some great material.  Aside from the genuinely great Sweet Jane (finally in its uncut version) and the anthem Rock and Roll, there's also the opener Who Loves the Sun.  It's one of my favorite Velvet songs, and Doug's vocal is wonderful.  Yule gets a lot of flak from Velvet fans, but he had a lovely voice.  This is a great rock record despite the turbulent production and debate over whether it's a real Velvet Underground album.  I believe it is, despite it being their weakest, but then all of their albums were masterpieces prior to this, so that's a hell of a legacy to top.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video with the intention of overall toning and weight loss. I will say that the program is working quite well. I am on day 21 and have dropped about 9lbs and my overall energy level and stamina has improved.  Just to give you an idea where I started, I was about 154lbs and now 145. I am 5'6\\" and under the age of 30. Just stick with it! It works! I have tried many different videos and found this is great even for me with no cordination whatsoever! Before this video I ran up the stairs and got winded. Now I can jog 1/2 mile and not feel too tired. Also my husband has told me he has seen a great improvement in my overall energy. I would reccomend this product to anyone who wants to increase their strength, tone and loose inches off their body. I havent changed much in my diet other than lots of water and no alcohol. Also cutting calories helps too but I love my ice cream treat every now and then. So all in all great product!!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I lost REM after \\"Automatic for the people\\". With \\"Accelerate\\" they are more than back. The rock and the power in this album is simply amazing. My favorite tracks: \\"Supernatural Superserious\\", Until the day is done\\", \\"Living well is the best revenge\\", \\"Hollow man\\", \\"Horse to water\\", \\"Man-sized wreath\\", \\"Accelerate\\" and my own private number one \\"Mr. Richards\\". Great sound, great feeling, great vocals, great guitars, great drums, great bass, everything is great. REM surprised me with this 2008 classic. Great job!
B000YABYLA|3.0|Well, I've seen the film Juno.  Some say it's the greatest film they've ever seen, others despise it.  What do I think?<br /><br />I liked Juno.  It was rather light and fluffy, to be honest.  Anyone who is expecting a realistic portrayal of high school life and teen pregnancy will be greatly disappointed.  The film is a little different than what you would see in a mainstream film, but not much.  It's not edgy, it's not out there, and it is desperately trying to be hip.  Juno's dialogue made me wince, like someone who is trying to prove how \\"out there\\" she is with her witty quips.  A lot of the dialogue felt forced, which diminished its impact for me.  Juno's character would not date (and never have sex) with someone like Michael Cera.  More than likely he would be the best friend who really loves her while she dates a jerk.  They would never get together.  The plotline of the jock who supposedly loves Juno is silly and completely underdeveloped.  Jennifer Garner's character was contrived as well.<br /><br />But there are some good things about the film.  I really like Jason Bateman's performance and character.  I think he gives the best performance in the film.  Many have made hay of Juno's knowledge of music and movies outside of her age bracket, saying it's not realistic.  That isn't true.  Speaking strictly for myself, when I was a teenager, I was listening to Miles Davis, Keith Jarrett, and ELP, which weren't popular at all during that time.  I also had a friend of mine who was 7 years older than me who I hung out with.  He got me into bubblegum music, which also wasn't from my time bracket.  So this does happen, and probably a lot more than people realise.  Juno's father and stepmother were pretty decent characters, far from the caricatures that permeate indie films like this.  They were a little too pat at times (especially the father), but overall their dialogue was better than know it all Juno's.  I liked the soundtrack too.<br /><br />The film is not a realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy, in fact, it makes it look kind of fun and hip.  It's a typical indie film that's quirky enough so that the audience thinks they're seeing something really different, but in fact they're just seeing something that's a little different from Hollywood fare, but not much.  We're not talking hard boiled Bergman or Breillat here, just a cute film that isn't boring or tedious.  It isn't painfully bad like Knocked Up was, but it still isn't a masterpiece.l of teen pregnancy, in fact, it makes it look kind of fun and hip.

B000LE0THO|3.0|This is, arguably, ELO's best work, closely followed by Eldorado, and A New World's Record.  The packaging is totally eye-catching, and fun.  HOWEVER... CDs should NOT be put into cardboard sleeves.  Especially extremely tight sleeves, like the one in this item.  I had real trouble getting the disc out of it's place, and was VERY careful, when trying to remove it.  Still, with all the hard work, and care, I was rewarded, not only with the scratches from getting the disc out of the sleeve, but it also seems as though the disc was very scratched up, in one area, due to rough insertion, into the jacket, during manufacture.  I have noticed this kind of trouble, before, with discs that are mass-produced, and assemebled into a tight sleeve.  The discs are shoved into position, and depending on the tightness of the fit, the items get damaged, and they will have varying degrees of damage, throughout the run.  No matter what copy you get, it will have damage, some better than others.  This is sad, because I truly wanted this to be a good copy, and keep it in it's package.  Normally, I would return the item, for a better one, but since they will, likely, all be scratched up, to some degree, I may as well save the frustration, and burn this copy, hope it is good, and keep my burned copy pristine, and leave the scratched one in the package, for show.<br />I wish they had just used the standard spindle.  That is a much safer way to save, and keep CDs from being damaged/scratched.  I hope I can burn a good copy, or this will have to go back, for replacement, and then the fun begins, of waiting for a new one, and hoping it won't be in worse shape.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|This film was remarkable.  I am an avid fan of psychological horror movies and this one was right up my alley.  For the lay viewer, the film might seem superficial and full of horror movie stereotypes.  For those of you who find it fascinating to see symbolism and basic human psychological processes, you should not miss this film.  I was most intrigued by the adaption of the overall fundamental aspects of the survival horror story:  a group of unsuspecting town folk become trapped inside a small space against an unknown, confusing force.  Very soon we begin to see the basic approach of the human psyche to dealing with the unknown.  People begin to fall into roles.  Leaders emerge, followers question, fear engulfs everyone, and the standard doctrine of coexistence of humanity breaks down to it's fundamental level.  Take away the conforts of technology and insert terrible fear and the unknown, and what you get is religion and politics at the basic level of wild animals.  You also get irrational behavior mixing with the rational behavior of what I would call the \\"survivors\\" or those humans who are most adapted to such situations as to avoid natural selection in the most basic sense.  Who would have thought that these technologicaly and socialy advanced people would so quickly break down and eventualy begin to even demand sacrifices and believe in an extremist view of faith?  Oh what so quickly we lose in our psyche when the unknown is so rapidly and violently injected.  This film is a masterpiece at capturing this basic breakdown of social behavior in the face of great unknown.      I'm still questioning King's view of faith.  Parts of the film make religion out to be a great evil, and the more subtle situations make faith out to be the savior.  The director did a masterful job of co-mingling the two sides.

B0000CF30C|5.0|This is a very powerful and percussive mix of Aerosmith's 3rd album. The bass is absolutely thunderous and that makes this disk a good one for showing off your system to any head-bangers that happen to drop by. I had to dial my subwoofer back twice during the opening cut, but that's fine.     I was happily impressed with the multichannel mix on this one. Jay Messina did an outstanding job of staying true to the original vibe of the album while taking advantage of current technology to make a classic sound even better.    Five Stars because I can't give it six.

B000A6T1KE|4.0|I'm simply amazed at how many Star Trek fans abhor this movie! I guess I'm not enough of a Trekkie to understand the hatred, though I have been a fan since the 1970's.    I first saw this movie in the theater, and just recently watched it again on DVD. I loved the movie both times. Sure there are some \\"How can that possibly happen?\\" moments, but Star Trek has always required a suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy it; and I don't think the stretches of imagination are that big in this movie to be off-putting.    This movie is definitely one of the more action-oriented of the franchise, but the action (along with the special effects) is well done and is fun and often edge-of-the-seat suspenseful. There is also the cerebral aspect in the question of what makes a human a human, and how a human being's past experiences are what really make him what he is - more so than his genetic makeup. I think Data finally realizes in this movie that he is a true individual and possesses the same quality that makes a human a human, which was a great moment to me.    The main villain Shinzon is very well acted, and his blind anger that has been brewing though years of abuse and his intelligence make him an intimidating and formidable foe. Yet he still has that sense of dignity and formality that you can imagine has been instilled into the Picard family line for generations. I also really like how dark and secretive the Remans are portrayed - particularly by the Viceroy. You get just enough of a glimpse into their culture to make sense of Shinzon's past, but not enough to understand them completely. It leaves you intrigued about them, and hopefully we will see more of them in the future.    Overall, this is a great \\"Next Generation\\" movie though not quite up to the level of the outstanding \\"First Contact.\\"    I also must say that the special features included with this movie are some of the best of all the \\"Collector's Editions\\" for the Star Trek movie series - very enjoyable to watch.
B000E1MXSW|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this movie five stars is because the beginning of it DRAGS so badly.  Be patient, it gets much better, and the choice of Audrey Hepburn, with her expressive eyes, was perfect.    It's the kind of movie that you will talk about and discuss with others who have seen it afterward, and that always makes me feel that I have seen a superior movie.
B00104QSOM|1.0|I am more than a little disapointed with this 2 disc version of There will be blood. There is practically no extras and no commentary( which is ridiculous in itself) No video log, no featurette, no interviews. Terrible. I'm not sure if there is a reason to buy this product.       The movie is great but try to find a version that is cheaper. PT Anderson has directed this film. He is an obscure director and outside of a few geeks you probably have not heard of him. But he creates movies that are not your typical hollywood movie. The acting is great.
B00030DEQE|5.0|I ordered this because I was having problem with my Verizon Fios internet connection. My computer is six years old but in great condition and runs fast. I have recently wiped it clean and reinstalled Windows XP Pro and it is a great computer, however, the internet connection was intermittent. I decided to try a new network card to see if that would fix the problem and it did. It was easy to install, simple to get running and I haven't had any internet problem since then. Great inexpensive item.
0316113077|5.0|I stumbled across this book in a book store.  I'd never heard of the author before nor had I seen her work. The book itself is gorgeous. Big colorful pages add a lot of inspiration. I am not new to baking and therefore have my old standby recipes. For that reason, I don't buy cake decorating books for their recipes, but rather for techniques, hints, construction ideas. This book has that in spades. The author shows in a few photos what would take pages to describe. I was able to make a near perfect gumpaste rose after seeing her step by step process. Overall this is a great book for anyone interested in cake decorating or for anyone who wants a fabulous coffee table book.     If you're looking for recipes, maybe it's best to look elsewhere. If you want helpful hints, good advice and great photos, start here.
B0015I2P0Y|3.0|Elbow's music might be slow, moody and morose, but it sure is downbeat.  An excellent choice if you are seriously depressed, considering suicide, and just need that little push to make up your mind.  On the other hand, if this is what you want, then they do it about as well as anyone, so I give them props for quality.
B00139B39E|5.0|I am surprised at some of the other reviews.  Some people seem to ask 'why did they bother'?  What these reviewers seem to miss is that if they are a die hard fan of DT and have all the albums then this compilation is not for them!  Why do you care?  If they want to repackage some of their more middle of the road songs to try and get some more people to enjoy their art, why would you criticize this?  Are you afraid that the 10 minutes it took them to put this set together took valuable time away from creating the next album or stopped Mike from working on his next piece in his AA suite?  Well it didn't.  I don't like seeing anyone giving this less than 5 stars because the music is amazing and this set should have 5 stars so more people will check it out.      Yes it doesn't have any of the epic songs, and it doesn't bring anything new but if it brings more fans to the band and makes them some money so they can continue making great music then that is awesome.  Just because something isn't geared at you doesn't make it bad.    Enough ranting.  For everyone else, if you are not a DT fan you should be and this is a great disc to get to hear a couple of hours of amazing music.  If you want to take it to the next level then get their other albums and listen to some 20 minute compilations that will blow you away.   If so you have about 10 hours of great music ahead of you.
B0012IWHUU|5.0|don't be fooled but the editorial review of this cd there are not not classic cover as I had thought with the review but one cover jailbreak not the AC/DC cover either.this cd stays true to the warriors code cd a great mix of irish folk with a punk rock injection and more well written originals than the last 2 cds.Rick barton returns for fill'ins from a rush recording then quick of to tour in europe.
0345495004|5.0|Nancy Horan's done a masterful job of re-creating the world of Mamah and Frank! This book provides remarkable insight into the life and times of an intelligent woman at the very infancy of the \\"Woman Movement\\" in America, and an unforgettable look at the real Frank Lloyd Wright. Mamah is a particularly memorable character; frustrating at times, to be sure, but riveting nonetheless. Their love story- and it is not without warts- is believable and absorbing; their lives are fascinating. This book will leave you thinking (and Googling Taliesin, Mamah, and Frank!).
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|This movie was extremely well done... the terror of the people in the film going through what they were was perfectly put together. I don't understand the complaints on the movement/stabilization needed... I thought the effect of the movie being filmed on video camera added to the terrifying feeling trying to be captured.. what these people are going through during something horrible. I admit that I am not a fan of Blair Witch and was hesitant about the way this was filmed at first (before seeing it), but I thought with this movie it absolutely worked. The movie was not over done at all. The characters are great, and JJ Abrams (creator of LOST) is wonderful as always. The hidden meanings are always fun to figure out. But overall the movie really was well done. If motion of a camera is something that makes you feel sick, then I would suggest not to watch.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|Despite going to the opera for the first time when I was 7, it's taken me more than 20 years to really appreciate the artform and I've recently begun collecting DVDs. This production was the first Così I ever heard or saw and - having seen a few more since then - will likely be the last. If I lost my mind and decided to watch it with the sound muted, I'd still be thoroughly entertained - the comic and dramatic talents of the players here is unsurpassable! I'm particularly fond of Anke Vondung's ditzy Dorabella, but everyone is amazing. I must say that the setting and costumes (no turbans, thank God!) adds to the already potent mixture. The clear and crisp sound of Fischer's well-conducted period instruments is pure joy. The four principal singers all do marvellous jobs and over the last few times I've watched the DVD, I've taken to counting the number of times you see any of them looking at the conductor... It may 'just' be fantastic video-editing (which is the case, no matter what), but the few and very discrete times I've caught them looking at Fischer can be counted on one hand - alltogether. Aside from indicating that the production is thoroughly rehearsed, it does wonders for keeping up the 4th wall between performers and audience. Allround brilliant DVD!

B000JU7NCE|3.0|The Cure have only two live DVD's - both recorded post 2000; 20 years after they began and at least 5 years since their prime. \\"Trilogy\\" - a three hour set which includes Pornography, Disintregration, and Bloodflowers in their entireties; and this DVD - \\"The Cure: Festival 2005\\".    Released in late 2006, it was shot during the band's headlining shows at 9 European music festivals in the summer of 2005. The video features a variety of angles \\"captured by a mix of fans, crew and 'on-the-night-big-screen cameras'. It is noted by the return of former guitarist Porl Thompson. Festival has 30 songs taken from most of their albums so it provides a much wider range of material than Trilogy. It is also heavily waited towards the material that Porl Thompson was involved in - from 'The Top' to 'Wish'.    \\"Open\\" (from Wish)   \\"Fascination Street\\" (from Disintegration)   \\"alt.end\\" (from The Cure)   \\"The Blood\\" (from The Head on the Door)   \\"A Night Like This\\" (from The Head on the Door)   \\"The End of the World\\" (from The Cure)   \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\" (from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me)   \\"The Kiss\\" (from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me)   \\"Shake Dog Shake\\" (from The Top)   \\"Us or Them\\" (from The Cure)   \\"Never Enough\\" (from Mixed Up)   \\"The Figurehead\\" (from Pornography)   \\"A Strange Day\\" (from Pornography)   \\"Push\\" (from The Head on the Door)   \\"Just Like Heaven\\" (from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me)   \\"In Between Days\\" (from The Head on the Door)   \\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea\\" (from Wish)   \\"The Drowning Man\\" (from Faith)   \\"Signal to Noise\\" (B-side to \\"Cut Here\\")   \\"The Baby Screams\\" (from The Head on the Door)   \\"One Hundred Years\\" (from Pornography)   \\"Shiver and Shake\\" (from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me)   \\"End\\" (from Wish)   \\"At Night\\" (from Seventeen Seconds)   \\"M\\" (from Seventeen Seconds)   \\"Play for Today\\" (from Seventeen Seconds)   \\"A Forest\\" (from Seventeen Seconds)   \\"Plainsong\\" (from Disintegration)   \\"Disintegration\\" (from Disintegration)   \\"Faith\\" (from Faith)     Although it is an excellent collection of songs, there isn't much variety in terms of the visual experience - a byproduct of festival touring. I don't mind the different camera techniques but I don't think the sound mix is very good for this day and age.     It seems a little strange that The Cure's best live video - the full concert \\"Live in Orange\\" has not made it to DVD, yet an average live DVD that is no better than some Cure bootlegs gets an official release.
006135323X|5.0|This is a very entertaining book.  Ariely's research is turning behavioral economics into a \\"hard\\" science or at least an empirical one.  The minute he comes up with a new hypothesis he also comes up with a way to test it using his MIT students as a social science lab.  Many of his experiments and other ones he studied are already classics in social sciences.  The experiments where drugs that are expensive are more effective than cheaper ones (even though the actual drug was identical) and wines that are expensive taste better (even though the wine was the same) are already notorious.  You probably read about them in Scientific American or Psychology Today.<br /><br />Ariely starting point is with our dominant sense: vision.  He shows how our eyes can be fooled.  Depending on how an image is presented we see objects' size and colors differently from what they are.  At his website, he shows many more intriguing visual traps.  So, if our eyes can be fooled, can our abstract reasoning be tricked too?  Do we make judgments assuming we are rational when we are not?  Are those irrational behaviors predictable?  That's what this book is all about.<br /><br />Some of his examples are pretty intriguing.  People bids for various objects were influenced by the last two digits of their social security number (that they were asked to recall before bidding).  This is \\"price anchoring.\\"  His example of the Duke Basketball tickets is baffling.  He becomes a middleman buying tickets from ticket owners to resell to others who did not get tickets.  He found no takers as the average asking price from ticket sellers was an amazing $2,400 and the bid price from potential buyers was $175.  That's a huge bid-ask spread that seems truly irrational.  The zero effect is interesting too.  We often make poor choices because something is thrown in for free.  Ariely smartly connects the zero effect to our wired-in strong loss avoidance.  If something is free, we can't possibly loose anything right?  We think that way.  Ariely uncovers situations where we make bad choices that way.  Chapter 8 makes a good case for simplifying our lives and focus on the few things we love and are effective at.  Instead, we encumber ourselves by maintaining choices open and reduce our productivity and happiness overall.<br /><br />His writing on the placebo effect and expectations is excellent.  One part I found shocking is when he states the couple of well established surgical operations (a form of bypass surgery and knee arthroscopic surgery) that were tested against placebo (fake surgeries).  They showed no benefits.  He pondered how many other surgeries would this also be the case for?<br /><br />Another classic experiment he mentioned related to expectations was the math test taking of American Asian women.  When they thought of themselves as Asian they did better than when they thought of themselves as women.  So, expectations affect performance.<br /><br />But some of Ariely's examples may not denote irrationality.  When he indicates that when people move from an expensive real estate market to a cheaper one, they spend close to the same amount on their new home vs what they sold their old home for.  By doing so, they buy more of a house than they need.  The reverse is true too.  When moving from a cheap real estate market to an expensive one, people buy much smaller homes and end up being cramped.  He calls that irrational.  But, people just buy what the sale proceeds of their old house allow.  He also states that lawyers will turn down an offer to work for $30 to give legal assistance to the elderly.  But, they'll accept to work for free (volunteer).  For a lawyer, volunteering generates goodwill within his community.  Meanwhile, working for cheap does not.  I don't view that as irrational.  When people order beer in the U.S. they order different brands to promote their individuality.  Meanwhile, in Asia they tend to order the same brand to promote cooperation.  But,is it irrational to follow cultural norms?<br /><br />Even though I don't think we are quite as irrational as Ariely suggests, this is still a fascinating book.  You can tell I really enjoyed it.  If you found my review interesting you will like it too.  I also strongly recommend Scott Plous's [[ASIN:0070504776 The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making]] that covers the same topic.norms?

B000VR824S|5.0|What a great video! From Sonny Landreth's opening set this concert was fantastic. Highlights for my wife and I were Landreth, Jeff Beck, Johnny Winter, Buddy Guy and Derek Trucks. Doyle Bramhall, Vince Gill and John McLaughlin also had excellent sets. Eric's rendition of \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" was very good and a fitting tribute to George Harrison. The biggest problem was for me was that John McLaughlin only had one song and Jeff Beck only had two on the DVD. Those are two of the greatest guitar players of all time, I would have thought they would get more time on a DVD of a guitar festival.     While they weren't bad, Sheryl Crow, Steve Winwood and Willie Nelson suffered in comparison.  They just weren't quite at the same level as most of the other artists, IMO.     Sound and video quality were both excellent, I believe it was recorded in HD. If so, I hope it is eventually released on Blu-Ray, I would definitely double dip for this one.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|i love the series and love the video quality but i did not like the bad plastics it came in it all fell apart the first time i opened it and it is a pain to take the cds out of the box. the quality of the cd trays is also bad some of the cd restraints are broken so the cds keep falling out. overall not happy with the packaging
038533348X|5.0|The relative lack of solid character development alone might scare off the type of reader who feels compelled to know the protagonist's favorite kind of vegetable spread as much as the underlying premise of the story itself, but in what is easily Vonnegut's most concise verbal bitchslap of organized religion and the perils of modern technology, don't expect a warm fuzzy feeling upon completion.    Now, I wasn't even a twinkle in my old man's eye when this book was written, but the apocalyptic, (most likely) Cold War-inspired storyline upon first glance seems similar in tone to some other pieces from that general time period. In \\"Cat's Cradle\\", Vonnegut is quite successful in a short period of time (this is a quick read) to churn many of the constant fears in the modern world and turn them into an intelligent, cogent storyline that is in fact rather direct in its delivery. Many writers and many stories have touched on these topics but often delve (usually unintentionally) into sounding \\"preachy\\" and \\"overzealous\\". Vonnegut's wit and humor allows an otherwise mad genius to spin a tale as if Kurt himself is your friend, and not a fanatical know-it-all professor.    Again; the concept of scientific progress causing the slow but apparent evaporation of the very humanistic element we pride ourselves on as a species is far from groundbreaking. However, to do so and wrap it around such biting political and social satire (to create and explain \\"bokonism\\" seemingly on such a whim is simply...awesome) is another thing entirely.    The story itself is both humorous and rather appropriate for the times. Futhermore, as I hint in the above title, this is one of the darkest books I've ever read, but it should be.
0765342294|5.0|In totality, I believe that Enders Game is a very provocative book.  Its science fiction but it has the ability to be viewed as truth and reality.  The book grabs you and keeps you engaged.  You may find yourself finishing this lengthy piece in a few hours. It is full of stimulating ideas and a view of a future society.<br />  The beginning is written wonderfully, giving you a feeling as if you're living in their society.  It gives an eerie view of the future with the world being split up into separate alliances. The world as we know it was in two wars with an life force from the universe known as the Bugger, and are preparing for the third invasion.<br />The book gives a believable view of the future of the world and what a atmospheric war would look like. The book has parts that you may find disturbing, but it's intriguing and fascinating at the same time so you don't notice them as much. The book portrays the life of a boy who is isolated from society, and it shows how pressure and responsibilities can make you crack. Censorship of media and the secrecy of information by a world government can have corrupting effects in the future. The book is a fascinating read, that I believe anyone would enjoy.
0790729393|4.0|The movie is fantastic and I picked it up for ten bucks cause I love the acting, and how they systematically get their revenge.  Its not in a Stallone or Schwarzenegger Im-going-to-shoot-everyone-dead-who-ticked-me-off kind of way.  They use the court system, mobsters, and corruption to their advantage.    What disappointed me, is that in the theatrical release, they have a short text at the beginning of the movie detailing what a Sleeper is, and some text at then end before the credits roll stating something to the effect that \\"...the [Court] has no record that such a trial ever took place and no record of sex abuse in the Boys school (yada yada)  Lorenzo Carcaterras stands buy his story.\\"  These texts are left out.    Why???    Was it so controversial that they decided to take it out of the DVD release?  I know that sounds silly to complain, but when you read info like that, it gives the movie more mystery, authenticity, character.  You know this is someone's story who claims its true even if its not.  If someone watched this version, even if they knew about the book, would think the book and movie may be 100% fiction, instead of it being allegedly based off true events.    I dunno...was a little bummed by this as it lacks that punch to it.  But it was nice to watch the fantastic acting, engaging story, and climax to the end.  I am just bummed that this was cut out.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I read the book and liked it quite a bit - but I like the series even more. Quite a few changes in both characters and plot line. I ended up liking both, I think better than the book. Can't wait now to order season two. It was out of stock the other day when I checked. My brother and sister liked it too - we get together for \\"pizza night\\" every once in awhile and we kept watching - \\"just one more\\" episode.
B000Z1LOBI|2.0|Well what can i say about Testament, There one of the best thrash bands out to emerge from the late 80's. But this album is not really Trash, Some Elements of some Death- Chuck's voice But Does sound pretty mean, To me i dont think its that good of an album if you really Know testament and what they sound like before this album.  I would go with The New Order, Preach, Legacy. If you really like the sounds of this album go with Low, Gathering. Demonic is the last in Line with Testament.

B00154GEFU|5.0|Asia is back featuring the original 4 members from the first two albums.  The new studio release, Phoenix, is like a shocking dive back in time to 'fantasy music' heaven.  It literally sounds like it belongs in 1984 as the perfect followup to 'Alpha'.  The production style, raw playing, great punchy hooks all over the place intertwined with just a shade more progressive flair than either of the first 2 albums just force you back to the early 80's - whether you want to go along for the ride or not!  Several of the songs are captivating with their unexpected musical depth, progressive bent and flashy allure.<br /><br />oh yeah - and I'm probably the only one on the planet to notice, but some kind engineer had the infinite taste to bathe everything with just the right touch of auto-tune so we FINALLY get to hear John Wetton hit EVERY SINGLE NOTE dead on-key!  (well, at least the sustained notes where it matters, anyway).<br /><br />it's real, it's back, it's shockingly brilliant.  it's Asia's Phoenix!!!
B000000W9Z|5.0|I sometimes feel like I'm the only person who thinks this record is a little slice of genius. It was Bowie's return to form after many years of trying to find himself. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate Let's Dance and respected Tin Machine as an experiment in being part of a band... and even his low points of Never Let Me Down and Black Tie White Noise are better than the best of most artists. But Outside reassured me that the Bowie of the 70s never gave up making music.<br /><br />A lot of people compared it to Scary Monsters and I fully see the comparison. While I can't say the individual songs are as good as SM, part of that is because this is a far more ambitious record and I have a very difficult time listening to less than the full work. Taken as a whole, this is a stunning and impressive piece of work that I think beats the pants off of Scary Monsters and every other Bowie record.<br /><br />What I like most about this record is that it combined everything he'd learned after 25 years in the business... this melded the pop, dance, glam, punk, and ambient/experimental lessons into one meaty, well designed, brilliantly performed, and intelligently produced slab of wholly accessible art rock that worked primarily as a complete piece of music that could still be sliced up into a few catchy singles as standalone pieces. 15 years after its release, it holds up as well or better than most other Bowie records and still contains some of the best playing of many of the musicians included in the sessions. Really... this record is that good.<br /><br />Writing any more about this record is counter-productive. If you don't own it, buy it and listen to it as a whole. If you do own it and don't think it was that good, listen to it again... as a whole. If you don't agree with me after that, you're entitled to your opinion...<br /><br />...but you're wrong.
015603283X|5.0|This book is one of the best modern literary works today. I'm not even concerning myself with the plot or themes of this story in this review. There are many other reviews on here that do a much better job of explaining such things. One thing that sets this book apart from most others is the many literary references used by the author. The quotes from other works are chosen quite carefully to not only foreshadow the chapter but also as shining examples of literary quotes that make you want to go out and buy other books. This book serves as both a great story and a great guide for suggested readings.
0446402389|5.0|Set in Stalin's Soviet Union circa 1953, Child 44 is a dramatic, troubling tale of life under a repressive system that controls its citizens by regimentation and fear. Although the novel begins with the separation of two young brothers from a starving Ukrainian village in 1933, the events of that one day set in motion a terrible series of crimes that surface twenty years later, just prior to Stalin's death. The protagonist, Leo Demidov, is a member of the State Security, the MGB, rigorously performing his assigned duties, arresting accused traitors for questioning, their sad fates ordained the moment these unfortunates are arrested. Days before his life is altered by the mischief of another, Leo is assigned an unusual case, the mutilated corpse of a child, of necessity declared an accident. There are no crimes, no mistakes in the Soviet Union, a rigid hierarchy that controls the population with propaganda and terror, survival the currency of repression, people accusing others in order to save themselves.<br /><br />Buoyed by his investigative instincts and sense of invincibility, Leo has built an enviable life; when all that is necessary to establish guilt is accusation, it is not surprising when the finger of suspicion points at Leo, a jealous rival facilitating his fall. Leo has had no quarrel with his life, avoiding introspection until he and Raisa are the targets. Leo is demoted, the couple sent to a remote country village as punishment for an error in judgment. Once Leo is stripped of his power, the marriage is revealed as a sham. Raisa demands total honesty or she cannot stay. Then another child is found murdered, eerily similar to the one in Moscow, Leo caught in an impossible conundrum, not authorized to investigate crimes that do not exist in the eyes of the government. It is Leo's profound emotional journey that is the heart of this intriguing, provocative novel. With Raisa as the catalyst for a dormant conscience, Leo risks everything to accomplish one good thing before the long arm of the MGB reaches out once more to deal another blow. For Leo is not deceived: his punishment has only begun, a reprieve before a final reckoning.<br /><br />Relentless, Smith contrasts Leo's awakening in an environment meant to stifle individuality, Leo's soul blooming against a frozen landscape where horrors are perpetrated by a madman and a government that cannot bear scrutiny. This protagonist does not survive unscathed, battered by a government meant to intimidate, to silence dissension. The rigid constraints of a lifetime give way to Leo's quest for justice, a surprising tie to a forgotten past adding unexpected complications, Leo and Raisa under constant threat from one man's determination to see Leo punished for his earlier successes. The prose is consistent, compelling, the plot brilliantly sustained until the inevitable confrontation with the MGB. Dredging unexpected moments of humanity from morality's massive graveyard, Smith has written a stunning indictment of political repression in collision with hope.

B00154GEFU|5.0|The beauty of this \\"reunion\\" album is the fact that they don't try and create another album that is just like their debut.  They wrote and played songs in the style which fits them today.  There aren't alot of rockers on this, but a great mix of adult comtemporary songs.  Great song writing adn great lryics all the way through.  What one must get past it that ASIA isn't a progressive rock band, and I don't think they ever were.  People complain because of the history of the members, they want them to write Close To the Edge, or Starless.  It's been pretty consistent what these guys do, when they perform together and this album doesn't deviate from that.  Songs played extremly well, and Wetton's voice never has sounded better, which is quite amazing considering what he's been through and you hear what Jon Anderson and Greg Lake sound like today.  And Steve Howe's guitar playing clearly was what was missing on Astra, it's evident here.    I am a fan of Payne era Asia, and I'm thankful for it as it kept the ASIA flame burning somewhat, but i think it's clear that with this release, on top of the other 2 (Asia and Alpha) that there is no comparison.

B000HEVZ6W|5.0|Gattaca is a wonderful film that is likely to earn more respect and recognition as time passes. This is science-fiction at its best. Stylish and credible, Gattaca is vastly under-rated. In my view, it is easily one of the top-ten best sci-fi films of all time.<br /><br />Beyond the thought-provoking concepts regarding the future opportunities and problems surrounding genetics, Gattaca's greatest power may be its ability to inspire. Many people will come away from this film with the feeling that they really can make a good run at their dreams, no matter their background or supposed limitations.<br /><br />As we move deeper into the 21st century, with all it's gifts and burdens, we may find that we need the human spirit more than ever to cope. (to be clear, by \\"human spirit\\", I mean imagination, ambition, drive and our knack for achieving seemingly impossible goals).<br /><br />I give this film my highest recommendation.<br /><br />--Guy P.

B0013D8LOU|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Loads of extreme violence and demented ideas (although this could be a bad thing if you're squeamish; I consider it good because it's a direct contrast with the wonderful music, and makes everything seem freaky).<br />*Interesting imagery and special effects.<br />*Pretty good storyline (revenge is always fun).<br />*Lots of subtle comedy and strong drama throughout.<br />*Wonderful music throughout.<br />*Excellent acting.<br />*Great art design (as usual in a Tim Burton film).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Focus is solely on the main characters, who are all killers; there are no good guys in this film.  Although their cause is understandable, their actions are repulsive, and makes this whole thing disturbing (it's like Jack the Ripper starring in his own musical!).<br /><br />Although this is probably the best musical Tim Burton has made, it is also the darkest.  Between Tood killing people and his girlfriend cooking their corpses into meat pies (all to the sound of joyous music), it's very disturbing.  At the same time, that is what makes the film good.  You are made to relate to the characters' plights, before delving into total serial-killer madness.  Ultimately, it appeals to the wicked side of your tastes, and sucks you into a realm of grotesque pleasure.  This film truly turns violence into an art (and it's about time somebody made a dark and evil musical film!).<br /><br />Two-disc special edition includes a wealth of information on the making of the film, the history of the original stageplay, and the origins of the story.  I'm not sure what the one-disc version has (probably just the film and a 20-minute making-of documentary).
0670018651|1.0|For as long as I can recall I have been enamored of perfumes and colognes.    I almost always have at least five or six bottles of scent, which I rotate as I see fit, and am (I blush!) often complemented that the results are enjoyed by family and colleagues (or, even better, complete strangers!).    I picked up PERFUMES: THE GUIDE prmiarily to see how my current favorites, as well as several colognes I've had in the past, were evaluated.  I was disappointed that the tart-tongued Turin hadn't anything whatsoever positive to say...    ...about any of the fourteen (Yeah.  __14__) products I had in mind.    Nor do I consider myself so poorly-directed in the world of fragrance as to doubt my own good taste.    Which makes me wonder about the extreme slant Turin and Sanchez give to several producers of the colognes and perfumes in question, in addition to many others.  This is a highly prejudiced \\"guide\\" that serves very little in the way of objectivity.  Besides which, Turin's notes on several fragrances are nothing short of ultra-BITCHY, which made for unpleasant reading all around, particularly when the reader, unfamliar with the item being excoriated, comes seeking a balanced commentary.
B000OHZJ9Q|3.0|Out of the last 5 albums Steve Wilson and his band have released (FOABP, Deadwing, In Absentia, Stupid Dream, Lightbulb Sun), this is far and away the weakest. That's not to say it's a bad album, because it isn't; it's just not the in same league as its predecessors.    Why is this the case? There's a couple of reasons, but it really boils down to the tone of the album, which I would describe as detached at best, and bored to tears at worst. Sure, you can try and explain it away by bringing up the subject matter (which enough people have done so thoroughly as to allow me to avoid doing the same), but, if anything, that should've made the band's approach to the album all the more urgent, or even aggressive. It's a lesson Pearl Jam learned from Riot Act that translated really well to the self-titled album: in order to engage your audience (particularly when you're trying to get a pretty definite point across), you need to sound engaged yourself.    With the notable exception of the title track, I found myself pretty disinterested throughout the album. \\"My Ashes?\\" Please. \\"Anesthetized?\\" A mediocre guitar solo performed by a rock legend isn't nearly enough to save a bloated, less-than-intriguing song. And I don't even recall the rest of the album well enough to write an opinion on it.    I should close by saying that, were FOABP released by virtually any other band in the world, it would probably be a dramatic step forward in their evolution as artists (Thrice, I'm looking in your direction, here), but for Porcupine Tree, it's at best treading water. The outtakes CD blows most of this record out of the water.

B000OT6V00|1.0|A comic strip gone awry, full of special effects and pompous dialogue, this was designed for pre-teen boys bored with video games who need a laugh. The story line is erratic, the acting passable, the editing alright, but you'll not be able to make sense of the movie at all if you've passed puberty by more than a few years. If you're tempted by it, don't buy it until you've rented it first - if you can sit through this drivel more than once, buy one of the used copies as cheap as they come. The steep cost for blu-ray is a waste of money, because no amount of enhancement of the special effects can rescue this dog, destined for the clearance bins.

0767821629|5.0|When I first saw this movie on cable about seven years ago I was very pleasantly surprised how entertaining and thought provoking it was. I won't get into a lot of details except to say that I like the way the movie makes you think and the scenery and costumes of 1937 LA is very convincing and contrasts greatly with the dark, chrome and glass look of the present day LA.  I think the acting is about perfect for a quiet style of movie and I felt a connection to all of the characters. A couple of years ago I rented The Thirteenth Floor and enjoyed it even more in the Widescreen format.  I bought myself a small widescreen HD TV last year and decided to purchase a copy of this movie from Amazon.  I was greatly disappointed to find out that it is only Full screen and not Widescreen. It is also annoying that the subtitles are defaulted to be on so you have to turn them off first.  I ordered this movie from another company that specifically advertised Widescreen and it too is only Full screen so I returned it.  I have since found out that Sony has screwed around with many of its movies and is only releasing them in Full screen format and The Thirteenth Floor is one of them.  Apparantly a Widescreen version is no longer available which is a shame because this is one movie that needs to be seen in widescreen.

B000MRA5NS|4.0|I had previously purchased this movie on DVD, but once I got my Bluray player, decided to purchase the Bluray version because I enjoyed the movie so much. This is a great beginning with a new \\"Bond\\" at the helm. I was not sure if Daniel Craig would be able to join the ranks of Sean Connery or Roger Moore as James Bond, but he did an excellent job. The movie is action-packed and I hope that the second installment will be as good as this one. This is definitely a Bluray \\"must have\\" library addition.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|The gimmick: a \\"horror/monster\\" film shot entirely on digital film and created to look as if it was not edited, but rather turned on and off at percise moments. It tricks people into thinking it's \\"unique\\" and even more scary since you can't see exactly what's going on. I'll tell you what was going on; as you kept your eyes fixed to the screen, the producers emptied your pockets of cash.      I know there is some \\"mythology\\" and a whole underground thing to Cloverfield, but fact is this- if ANYONE were to spend their time filming throughout an event such as those that took place in Cloverfield, then they would AT LEAST KEEP THE CAMERA STILL FOR ONE MINUTE! Nobody films something that important, yet still manages to turn away each time we have a chance of seeing \\"something\\". And the Screenplay... could not be more than six pages long. The rest was total \\"OK, you're at a going away party. You're young and horny. And.... ACTION!\\".        Thousands out there will say \\"you just don't get it...\\", well, hate to tell you folks, I got it and it's called a HOAX. Clever as it may be, it's still a hoax. Nothing in the following films can make this one worth while. In other words, who cares what fell from the sky at the end! Oh, and the last few whispered words? Probably \\"you've been played\\"

He definitely knows how to weave a storyline!  Out of all of his books, this is my least favorite, but it still is above most of the authors that I have read.
0061122416|4.0|The alchemist by Paulo Coelho is a refreshing lapse into the way stories used to be told.  A boy, a dream of treasure and a journey, it is perhaps the oldest of tales, but Coelho makes it all fresh and new by highlighting the simple, but important things that many of us have long forgotten.  How long since we first had our own dreams of going out into the big world and making things happen?  Coelho brings it all back with his brilliant, insightful storytelling.  While on his journey, Santiago learns about new and different people as well as foreign places and in doing so he learns even more about himself and the type man he wants to become.  Though it is just another version of an ancient tale, it is told simply and for the most part lyrically and so well that the author has crafted it into something special and memorable.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Special effects: very good.  Plot, acting, story...  Don't even bother, and the special effects don't make up for wasting your time.  I'd rather stare at an ant hill for the duration of this movie--much more interesting.
0316010669|4.0|Blink by Malcolm Gladwell has a lot of interesting and unusual observations, mixed in with research and life stories that all tie together neatly.  Some of it is fun, you get to take tests. You also have to figure out what people are saying to each other, when you suspect the words of the conversation have nothing whatever to do with what they are actually trying to tell each other.  Thinking while talking and listening is a skill and this book helps develop that skill by teaching you to hear between the lines.<br />  What's really great about this book is it is not boring and there are plenty clever tips you can add to your communications skill set.  It also has some fascinating things to say about decision making and personal motives.<br />  Though none of the information is really provocative, some of it very unusual.  I thought the military decision making was especially interesting.  All and all it was solid information delivered in an easy to read style that kept it interesting and entertaining as well as educational.
B000E33VWW|4.0|276 Amazon customer reviews as of now for \\"Capote\\" and only 61 for \\"Infamous\\"... Have you heard of \\"the other movie\\"?<br /><br />\\"Capote\\" came out in '05 and \\"Infamous\\", right behind it, in '06. That's been at the expense of \\"Infamous\\" and more importantly of the public- because \\"Infamous\\" is the better film. Since it came out a year after the well recieved and highly publicized \\"Capote\\" I guess America had enough Capote and had paid enough attention to the somehwhat grim story behind the creation of the novel \\"In Cold Blood\\".<br /><br />As far as \\"Capote\\" goes it's a good film and deserving of critical praise, especially of coarse for Philip Seymour Hoffman who ended up with an Oscar. He did about as good a job as any actor could in portraying the famous, \\"eccentric\\"(lol) author.<br /><br />Hoffman did about as good a job as any could, except for one Toby Jones.<br /><br />Toby Jones is a talented actor and happens to be a Truman Capote look-a-like. It is uncanny, the physical resemblance. And on top of that Jones perfectly captures the voice Gore Vidal described as sounding what a Brussels Sprout would sound like if it could talk. He was as they say, born for part.<br /><br />Of coarse the films must be compared: They both have their strenghts and respective flaws or weaker aspects. But as many have said, they serve as great companion pieces -each offering a different perspective on a complex artist and the events surrounding the creation of his greatest work. What a unique and interesting situation to have two very well made films done at about the same time and on the same fascinating subject.<br /><br />The more entertaining -and at least as well acted film- is \\"Infamous\\", however. And after seeing Toby Jones as Truman Capote, Hoffman is just not as impressive.<br /><br />If you see \\"Capote\\" definitely don't fail to miss \\"Infamous\\". And vice versa.<br /><br />\\"Infamous\\" -5 Stars.

B0013SJ44Q|5.0|Forty three years after its first vinyl release on Volt and after two CD releases (mono on Atco; stereo on a rare Japanese reissue) - this album sounds as great as it always did. The major revelation is the stereo version newly remastered by the guys at DigiPrep - Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch - it is INCREDIBLE - having listened to this album for the full 43 years in stereo-I now hear things in the stereo version that I never knew were there! A must have version of perhaps the greatest soul album of all time.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is the CD that took me out of a downward spiral from the state of music. At the point of release of this CD music was in a repeat mode for me...everything was kinda the same and i didn't really care for a lot of it. I heard a couple of cuts off this CD and I was cured! This cat is about as good as anybody out today. I love his lyrics and his guitar playing has only improved thru the years. Classic sophmore-ish style of lust with Your body is a wonderland...\\"why Georgia\\" is a great song...i really don't give a damn about what some editorial reviewer personal grudge is...man,Ricky, did John Mayer kick your dog or what bro! It sounds as if you were bullied by him in the 3rd grade and you're finally offered your chance at \\"REVENGE!\\"...mellow bro, go on a date and get out of the house...No such thing, NEON,Why Georgia, and Wonderland offer up some of the best in Adult contemporary tunes today. I just re-purchased this CD this month because it's just good...no fancy words or clever put downs...i like this CD...a lot! This White boy with soul is one bad guitar playing fool!
0452289963|5.0|I agree with Oprah when she said this is the best thing she ever did.  When I read \\"The Power Of Now\\" a few years ago I was so excited but I didn't think most people would be ready for what he had to say.  When she chose \\"A New Earth\\" for her book club, I started reading it. I joined her book club where Eckhart and her discuss a chapter every week.   I just love it and am so excited that it is helping so many people.
B000NY17J6|5.0|This is a great import CD that includes both of the famous Linda Ronstadt Greatest Hits albums, Volume One and Volume Two. If you want a Linda Ronstadt CD, this is the one to get in my opinion. Outstanding vocals on all 23 tracks, she is a unique and extremely talented singer. My favorites include Blue Bayou, Ooh Baby Baby, You're No Good, How Do I Make You, and It's So Easy.
0312965788|5.0|Mr. James Herriot is an uncommon writer, possessed of extraordinary skill and a mastery of the English language. When speaking of works of fiction, he is my favorite writer. His ability to choose perfectly appropriate and descriptive words, phrases, and metaphors to verbally illustrate unique characteristics, landscapes, feelings, and situations still has me mesmerized.<br /><br />\\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" is autobiographical in that Mr. Herriot is the central character of the book, though James Herriot is the pen name of the real author, Jim Wight. However, since the work is defined as a novel, then one may assume that Mr. Herriot took certain liberties in relating many of the tales he unfolds. Mr. Herriot is a veterinary surgeon, and much of his novel specifically involves dealing with particular cases of sick livestock and ailing house pets. One should not quickly conclude, however, that this story is merely about the ramblings of a country animal doctor who at times finds himself in interesting situations, as some reviewers would suggest.<br /><br />Instead, my feeling is that Mr. Herriot utilized his visits to multiple and varied farms and residences in the British countryside to highlight the individual conditions, attitudes, and distinctive persons he discovered at each location. The book becomes absolutely delightful and poignant, for instance, when Mr. Herriot kindly sits at an aging woman's bedside and tenderly comforts her with his voiced belief that her devoted, loving dogs and cats are indeed possessed of souls and that she need not fear that they will again be her companions in the afterlife.<br /><br />And I do not believe I have laughed out loud so frequently while reading one book. Some of my personal favorites are when his brakes go out on his car and he must navigate a steep and winding descent to the bottom of a low valley, where his next veterinary visit is scheduled, and when he finds himself on his first date with the woman he is destined to marry and the only respectable dress suit he owns is several years out of fashion and far too tight-fitting, which is partly why he becomes far too nervous and a bout of awkward conversation and actions follow. Additionally, much might be said here about the quirky relationship Mr. Herriot has with his unpredictable and explosive yet perfectly harmless and generous employer, a Mr. Siegfried Farnon, and Siegfried's younger brother, Tristan. Farnon's demanding attitude regarding his veterinary business affairs, especially in the face of Tristan's irresponsibility in mishandling assignments and responsibilities, is often the basis for much of the hilarity in the book.<br /><br />In speaking of his relationships with those to whom he is closest on a personal level and the frequently visited owners of his animal patients, Mr. Herriot has an especially profound gift when it comes to praising the best characteristics that are found in the human race. He speaks with eloquent fondness when describing the beautiful traits he sees in his lovely Helen, his soon-to-be wife. And when he stumbles upon a man or woman who he feels is in ownership of certain admirable exceptionality, such as industry or thrift or honesty or discipline or gentleness, his written accolades of such persons is heartwarming and deeply inspiring.<br /><br />Thus I would say that this book has everything. It touches upon the topics of death, faith, humor, love, devotion, stewardship, human strengths and frailties, prosperity and poverty, work and idleness, occupation, and the list goes on. Given that these interesting topics are handled so capably by Mr. Herriot's writing talent, I doubt that any sensitive reader would find this book to be anything but delightful and praiseworthy.respectable dress suit he owns is several years out of fashion and far too tight-fitting, which is partly why he becomes far too nervous and a bout of awkward conversation and actions follow.

B0014BECF8|5.0|So I grew up with my sis who is 5 yrs older than me.  We shared a room and she had every G.M. possible.  Anyway, he announced a US tour.  So I ordered this cd, then my sis called me and bought us tickets to the concert!<br />Anyway, these two discs have most of the best songs on it, although I am miffed that \\"Monkey\\" and \\"I want your Sex\\" are not included and I think they belong on there more than the newer songs.  But they are good too.  If you love George and you like to have mental flashback of where you were when you heard these songs, etc. then I reccommend buying this so you get all of the way from Wham to Faith!<br />ps.  My sister still doesn't want to believe he likes boys...  She does have a tattoo on her foot of his symbols from some album!!!  What a freak.
0385473788|1.0|ACH, DU LIEBER!!!!<br /><br />That's the biting phrase that can best epitomize my personal feelings at the disconnect between the expectation of Anne Frank's diary and the actual reality of reading it. The Diary of Anne Frank is very, very, very disappointing and a humongous letdown!!!! To wit, I must implacably question and hold in contempt the judgment processes of the many, previous, sycophant reviewers who've been exaggerating the \\"beauty\\" or \\"grace\\" or whatever politically correct term of flattery they can invent for this diary. The Diary of Anne Frank is one of the most caustic examples of herd mentality-syndrome and mass hysteria among the many positive-rating, Amazon reviewers. In truth, this diary of Anne's is just plain, bloody awful and doesn't deserve its classic status to say the least!!!! I suppose the hordes of five-star reviewers simply turned off their brains, refused to analyze Anne's diary critically, and just subserviently jumped on the bandwagon of conventional wisdom, where her diary is hailed a \\"classic.\\" BS!!!!<br /><br />After having thoroughly read this, I can assure you that it's no classic and D-E-F-I-N-I-T-E-L-Y not worth your time or money...unless, of course, you get your kicks and jollies from plumbing the trivial and superficial mind of a fourteen-year-old. This stellar, brutally-but-intellectually-honest review of mine will analytically break down precisely what the hell's wrong with Anne's diary (plenty!) and warn you against reading it. If you're not narrow-minded and can take an analysis which intrepidly contravenes the discreditable conventional wisdom of the masses, then you'll be grateful for this review. If you're a hypersensitive sheeple, then I expect you to be appalled and shocked at the alleged \\"audacity\\" of this review, but that's YOUR problem, not mine. All I concern myself with is an intellectually honest review of this diary.<br /><br />I went into The Diary of Anne Frank because it came to my attention that I hadn't read it in high school, whereas many of my peers had indeed had it mandated for reading in school. I attended a Catholic high school, and it's not like Catholics have something even remotely to be shameful about concerning their treatment of Jews in WWII. Why, in fact, educated people know that even N*zi Adolf Eichmann confessed in his diaries that the Catholic Church in occupied Italy was the only organization that loudly protested and opposed the mass deportation of Jews from their \\"ghetto\\" in Rome. So, I wanted to catch up on this apparent \\"classic\\" because it was missed reading at my old, Catholic high school.<br /><br />However, I absolutely regret and curse this misjudgment of mine due to the appalling quality and shortcoming of the content of the diary. See, as a new reader, I perceptively went into the Diary of Anne Frank with the reasonable expectation that it would, you know, perhaps talk about her feelings relating to--I don't know!--the genocidal, N*zi occupation, which had forced her family and some acquaintances into an attic, where they lived like imprisoned animals under extreme duress. That would make for an interesting read obviously because one would delve into the psychology of a person in such duress and try to relate. Conventional wisdom has it that that's what her diary mainly relates to, but in actuality...her diary's actually filled to the nauseating brim with her infatuation (nah, kids these days would call it her \\"crushing) on her attic-mate Peter; endlessly boring stories about preparing and storing vegetables in their attic; girl talk about her prior crush before she went into hiding; lurid tales about her discovering her budding sexuality; typical teen-girl angst about how she's never really had close girlfriends; grumbling about the adults in the attic always rebuking her due to her forthrightness; and how she hates her mother like a typical EMO teenager, just to name a few!!!!<br /><br />Anne disappointingly spends precious few entries (the vast minority) on the more interesting and valuable ruminations, such as those on human nature, persecution of Jews, and the terror felt inside the attic that came primarily from being discovered, or from the sounds and sights of war breaking loose outside her attic (on a couple of entries, she even recounts stories of downed fighter planes and their pilots' fate). That's the unpardonable fault of her diary because only these kinds of idiosyncratic entries actually material to WW2 are what would elevate her diary above that of any other, mundane, teen girl's. That so much of her diary is precisely so ordinary according to what one stereotypically expects from ANY teen girl's entries is the real pity in this exaggeratedly hyped work.<br /><br />I found the purpose of Anne's diary much more useful in detailing how more wonderfully conservative society was in the 40s--rather than getting the reader to empathize with WW2-era, persecuted Jews--compared to today's liberal nightmare. In example, Anne's many entries where she's \\"crushing\\" on her attic-mate, Peter, involve feelings of sincere, simplistic affection and puppy love, maybe quaint but still adorable in hindsight. For instance, in many entries, Anne swoons over attic-mate Peter's confiding in her or the way he merely looks at her; to her as a girl in the 40s back then, that already qualified as a \\"fantasy.\\" Contrast this to the inarguable fact that in today's world, many 14-year-olds in Anne's shoes would probably have infectious thoughts of desiring to sexually please their crushes (and then do so!)  just so they could feel like \\"true women!\\" Another unmistakable motif in Anne's experiences that comes through as a confirmation of how more wonderfully conservative things were back then is the constant reference to schoolwork, and, by golly, actually doing well at it! In some entries, Anne actually *gulp* takes pride in getting good grades in school and measuring herself as a person based on her work ethic in class, again, wonderfully \\"old-fashioned.\\" Again, contrast this with many 14-year-olds today who--especially if they're in the NEA's public schools--can't read, write or do any `rithmetic, yet can tell you all kinds of things about the b*tches and h*es in rap music!!!!<br /><br />This latest edition of her diary, The so-called Definitive Edition, includes inexcusably AWKWARD entries involving Anne's sexual awakening, which is also a discomforting sign of the incrementing liberalism that's occurring societally, whereas her dad, Otto, wisely omitted these lewd entries from the original publication. For instance, on page 162, she writes, \\"Once when I was spending the night at Jacque's, I could no longer restrain my curiosity about her body, which she'd always hidden from me and which I'd never seen. I asked her whether, as proof of our friendship, we could touch each other's br*asts. Jacque refused. I also had a terrible desire to kiss her, which I did. Every time I see a female nude...I go into ecstasy.\\" Gross!!!! This egregiously has nothing to do with WW2, or a person's feelings of being imprisoned in an attic while hoping the N*zis don't discover her. The inclusion of this lewdness was utterly ill-advised.<br /><br />Surprisingly, though, some of Anne's entries include reflections which prove she possessed moral clarity and, unlike today's liberals (the arbiters of moral relativism), had the ability to judge between good and evil with regards to WW2. For instance, on page 334 (from July 21, 1944), she writes, \\"Now, at last, things are going well!...An *ss*ssination attempt has been made on H*tler's life, and for once not by Jewish Communists or English capitalists, but by a German general...This is the best proof we've had so far that many officers and generals are fed up with the war and would like to see H*tler sink into a bottomless pit...\\" Here, Anne clearly demonstrates that she confidently feels it's perfectly all right to be happy at the prospect of your enemy being killed in a war. Further, she also interprets the *ss*ssination attempt in a pro-Allies, anti-German way, suspecting that H*tler's generals are turning on him. Contrast that to today's dreadful, modern liberals who would have a hell of a hard time rejoicing about the prospect of Bin Laden's death or any terrorist's, for that matter, because they're too obsessed with getting them \\"legal rights\\" through habeas corpus and moving them onto the US mainland for detention purposes!!!!<br /><br />Still, Anne's diary is soooo disappointingly off-the-mark that I want anyone even flirting with the idea of reading a fourteen-year-old's musings to just boycott it. It's so dreadful because it mostly evades reflecting on WW2 and the hardships of attic life. Mainly, it reads like every other fourteen-year-old girl's diary from the beginning of time to infinity, and, so, is an absolutely superficial read!!!! To get an idea of how WW2 affected people, you can get a better read almost ANYWHERE ELSE. If you want to get inside a fourteen-year-old girl's trivial head--which Anne's diary is really mostly about: crushes, boys, resentment of parents, etc.--you should just steal your kid sister's.

B000YABYLA|5.0|So I think this movie lived up to the hype it got around the Oscars.  I thought it was pretty funny, dramatic and at some points sappy.  It is not a chick flick though!  Juno is a lovable character and you love the way she deals.  Although, I wish my parents reacted so nicely when I was 18 and preggers!  Anyway, I loved it.  I found myself relating to her in the beginning of the movie when she is talking about the boys going by in their skimpy running shorts. She can see their \\"Pork Swords\\" bouncing!  Omg, that is so funny.  I also see the same thing when men wear sweat pants in public!  It is gross and it shouldn't happen.  Anyway, back on the subject.  Watch it and love it.
B000683VI4|1.0|The stereotypical tearjerker-fest, The Notebook, is infamous for appealing mostly to women--because their gender is one that's characterized by emotionality, nurturing, negotiating and verbalizing (ok...and, yes, wild mood swings)--while being avoided by men. Due to our society's gender stereotypes, sensitive men who want to get in touch with their proverbial, \\"feminine\\" side by watching The Notebook will inevitably be derided as \\"g*y,\\" \\"h*mo,\\" \\"que*r\\"...you get the point.<br /><br />Well, that's where I put MY foot down!!!! See, I don't give a damn if the whole world knows I'm a man--NOT G*Y, though (not that there's anything wrooooong with that, wink, wink!) who enjoys The Notebook!!!! I don't care if the whole world knows that I'm suffering through a mid-life crisis; am \\"whipped\\" by my wife in a one-sided marriage-of-convenience; stay at home watching the kids as a stay-at-home-dad while my wife brings home the bacon; or cry during and after extremely brutal and domineering sex with my wife (her nickname is \\"ballbuster\\"). I am a man (hear me roar; no, more like meow and purr) who just happens to really enjoy the emasculated-man's movie, The Notebook...to where I'm actively psychologically dependent on said movie just to get by every day of my life.<br /><br />See, I'm the kind of man who's the leftover relic of the stereotypical, \\"sensitive,\\" 90s-type man...except I'm now living in the 21st century. As such, I purposefully gravitate towards proverbial \\"chick flicks,\\" films which will get me murderously derided as a \\"h*mo,\\" \\"que*r,\\" etc., just because I'm intentionally trying to get in touch with my feminine side (and my wife who whips the hell out of me has threatened to withhold sex AGAIN and berate me in public if I don't comply!).<br /><br />So, it follows that The Notebook was the no-brainer choice for me to get in touch with my feminine side; you know, the side that's more nurturing, intellectual, loving...and also bossy, irrational, and oftentimes just plain bitchy (and definitely no good with managing money). Anywho, what attracted me instantly to The Notebook were the leads: Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams (both Canadians, which immediately lowered my respect for the casting director). Especially Gosling, who, when he removes his shirt in the film (4 times; I know; I counted), has that desirable, lean-muscular look that you could just picture yourself ******! Ahem, just disregard that last thought...I really wanted to write that McAdams is very hot. Very, very hot indeed. Yes, I'm a heterosexual man and I find women \\"hot.\\" Yes, that's what I really meant.<br /><br />I was monstrously confused by the abrupt and awkward flashback sequences of The Notebook; that's how it tells its story: James Garner and Gena Rowlands are the contemporary Noah and Allie, who are now old and near-death. The flashbacks tell the story of their meeting and sometimes torrid courtship and relationship while Garner and Rowlands are Noah and Allie in the present, one beset with Alzheimer's and the other having a bad heart.<br /><br /> The first flashback tells of Noah and Allie's first encounter. He pursues her at a carnival--which is so alien to me since as a guy in touch with his feminine side, my wife actually courted me--and actually does some ext*rtion to force her to go out with him (he hangs on a pole when the ferris wheel's stopped and threatens to let go). This leads to Noah and his friend bumping into Allie and her friend at the movies like THAT'S never happened before in a romantic movie! Noah and Allie get some alone time via going for a walk when it's revealed that their respective friends are horn dogs, who continuously stick their tongues down each other's throats at the movies (first, this lascivious showing of lust bothered me, but then I realized I was a moral relativist, so I was fine with it!). Their walk ends up deteriorating in a barbaric clich&eacute; of boy-meets-girl predictability: they confide in each other, and he \\"philosophically\\" asks her why she never does anything for herself! This sappiness and insipidness would've already rightly driven away any real, heterosexual man, but I'm proud to say that in-touch-with-his-feminine-side me had the estrogen-loving willpower to still sit through it!!!!<br /><br />The flashback continues in a scene which has Noah luring Allie to an old, abandoned house he only claims he wants to fix up for her. Riiiiiight, we guys know what's really on Noah's mind in this case...he wants to cook her dinner, wind and dine her, and then NOT expect her to put out! Uhhhhhh, at least that's what my first date with my wife was like. Anywho, this abandoned-house setting brings forth the first, real untrustworthy part of the movie that even had a moral relativist like me discomforted.<br /><br />Keeping in mind that this film is rated PG-13, I nearly had a momentary pang of conscience when I next saw that Allie was slavishly begging Noah to shag her. What made it worse was that due to the film's misleading rating, I had ALL of my children gathered on the floor in front of the TV and around my La-Z-Boy recliner about to have their innocent, delicate eyes and minds exposed to potentially lurid, Hollywood-style glorification of p*rn!!!! However, I soon threw moral decision-making out the window when I realized that my kids--Ali Baba, Hassan, Benazeer, Ibn Al Ryad Bin Fazoul, Achmed and Butch (Butch is actually my adopted son; all the rest are from my first marriage when I forcefully had them convert to Islam)--would probably be having profane sex soon anyway, seeing as how they're all enrolled in the Maine school system, where birth control's available for 11-year-olds.<br /><br />So letting my kids watch the sex scene, I disappointingly discovered that it was merely the kind which frustratingly insinuates sex via the facial expressions and groans of the exemplary actors (kind of like the \\"lovemaking\\" in my marriage) instead of being full-on p*rn. Oh, well.<br /><br />At this juncture Noah and Allie are separated by his feelings of resentful inadequacy at Allie's parents' (they're well-to-do, you know) derision of him. He fights in WW2 (I hated this patriotic, pro-American tangent of the character in the film; this ALMOST ruined what could've been the perfect, sappy vehicle to put me in touch with my feminine side permanently) and so breaks off contact with Allie for seven years. Bizarrely, though, the conclusion of the war finds him right back in the same town where--gasp!--Allie still resides also, probably due to the writers' abysmal shortcoming at understanding proper believability in film! In the meantime, Allie's been shacking up with an equally well-to-do man who also served in WW2 (two pro-war characters in one movie?!

Conveniently, it starts to rain as they come in from the lake, and this, naturally, would make any two people want to have relations (I mean, sex, of course). Though I finally had moral reservations about my kids seeing this sex scene--I actually let them view it because, as I wrote earlier, my kids go to school in Maine, so it won't be long before they're doing stuff like this--I began to appreciate the stark, naked beauty of this sex scene.

This occurs out in the fields, yet it's really surprising to see the couple still kissing in their clumsy way after the 500 or so yards it takes to reach the front door of his house--keep in mind they had to awkwardly keep kissing while making their way through the rain to the porch!<br /><br />Here's where the sex scene really heats up in all its simulated, fabricated \\"passion.\\" Inside the entryway, Noah coldly manhandles Allie and roughly shoves her against the wall (at this juncture, I was slobbering in anticipation of \\"rough sex\\"), still emotionlessly simulating all the way. Next, Allie, the repressed vixen she is, hungrily strips off her man Noah's slacks to the point where her face actually is level with his crotch for a bit; the beauty of this glorious scene of selfish lust was such a human moment in this film, let me tell you. My loins were further massaged when Noah then pulled off an article of clothing off of Allie (who cares what it was at this point) and also hoisted her up with her legs wrapped around his pelvis. At this point of serene, though fake, lovemaking, my feminine side was being nurtured so much that it was almost in reach, and I thought I was climaxing. The sheer beauty of this simulated lovemaking was further enriched when Noah proceeded to carry Allie all the way through the long hallway, up several flights of stairs and then finally into an upstairs bedroom instead of ravishing her right there on the hallway floor like a heterosexual man would. Obviously, the very sensitive writers knew that real men unnaturally delay their sexual impulses until they can ceremoniously carry their women through the length of the entire house. The sex scene wrapped up in the epitome of further beauty: both actors showing their Oscar-caliber acting by screwing up their faces in grimaces of, I guess, passion while making grunting sounds. This was the filmmakers' representation of the ideal scene of beautiful lovemaking, and as the sensitive man, I do agree.<br /><br />At this point in the flashback, Noah gives Allie an ultimatum: to decide between him or her current, well-to-do boyfriend. Forwarding to the present again, the film shows Garner and Rowlands discussing this story up to this point. Keep in mind that the Rowlands character has Alzheimers and so cannot remember that Noah and Allie are in fact the present-day Garner and Rowlands. However, at this point in the film, a miracle occurs and Rowlands suddenly remembers everything! Woefully, though, this moment of fake peace is immediately ruined when Rowlands starts to go crazy and suddenly doesn't remember who Garner, as the older Noah, now is. Nurses then rush in and medicate Rowlands (about time, too!) while Garner starts crying and not about his Medicare benefits program being too hard to understand.<br /><br />The movie concludes in a rather callous way when a stealthy James Garner creeps into a medicated Gena Rowlands bed, and the two of them die together overnight; a nurse then discovers the stiffs in the morning. I conjecture that the writers assumed this would be a touching moment on which to end the film, but I found it a bit creepy. Still, the movie achieved its mission by putting me completely in touch with my feminine side and allowing my wife to \\"whip\\" me even harder in my marriage now. And this is how The Notebook ended up making a liberal man out of me.ntful inadequacy at Allie's parents' (they're well-to-do, you know) derision of him. He fights in WW2 (I hated this patriotic, pro-American tangent of the character in the film; this ALMOST ruined what could've been the perfect, sappy vehicle to put me in touch with my feminine side permanently) and so breaks off contact with Allie for seven years. Bizarrely, though, the conclusion of the war finds him right back in the same town where--gasp!--Allie still resides also, probably due to the writers' abysmal shortcoming at understanding proper believability in film! In the meantime, Allie's been shacking up with an equally well-to-do man who also served in WW2 (two pro-war characters in one movie?!

B000068PQ7|4.0|While I love this CD, it is missing something. Perhaps the rest of the Byrds. The songs are great, but the performances seem sleepy. The overall tone is deeply sad. I wanted some high flying harmonies, but what I got was some back to sticks and stems again stoner lethargy.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I've been a huge fan of thy Britney since I was in the fourth grade, and have never given up hope on her. Her music is cute and enjoyable, and her movie and TV appearances are always entertaining. With that being said, I not only give Blackout a 5 star review because I'm simply a fan, but because it seriously deserves it!    I think all of the tracks on the album are truly brilliant! When 'Gimme More' first leaked, and when the first words I heard were \\"It's Britney, b*tch.), I was like \\"=O!\\" Lol, I was so shocked at her new sound, and then the chorus came which was ridiculously catchy I could not stop singing (and attempting to dance) along! Then after taking a listen to the rest of the songs on her album, I knew I was not going to be disappointed. My favorites are ...    Gimme More: 9/10. Classic dance track, sexy lyrics, and a great choice for a lead single.  Piece Of Me: 10/10. I'm glad she did this song. It just had to be done.  Break The Ice: 12/10. This song is simply amazing! Great dance track with a technoish vibe! One of my favorites off of the album.  Radar: 11/10. LOVE IT! Very electropop, and it's quite addictive!    If you have an open mind about music, even if you didn't like any of her previous stuff, I'm sure you will enjoy this album. Overall, it's just a fun album with awesome songs that you can either dance or bop your head to! Trust me, you won't be disappointed!
B0012Q732O|4.0|Giant Birds , woolly mammoths , beautiful cinematography and Epic battle scenes. Next too StarGate , this is Roland Emmerich at his best. A very  satisfy-ing adventure - fantasy picture. Definitly a must see.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|It was awsome the first time around and even better now on blu-ray, get em all Enjoy
B000002H2H|4.0|\\"Ride the Lightning\\" was my first ever Metallica recording, and I love it. Made in less bass-worshipping days, the treble heavy sound is rough and metallic. The playing is, as it always is, fast and furious. Some of the greatest metal compositions are to be found on this album, including \\"For Whom the Bells Toll\\", \\"Creeping Death\\", and of course \\"Fade to Black\\".    The album definitely representend a refinement in terms of playing, composition, and production as compared to the first album \\"Kill 'Em All\\", but we are still talking about the very roots of the thrash genre here. Uncompromising metal from the kings of thrash. Highly recommendable.
B000XFVIMQ|5.0|I was very happy to this one brought to blu-ray, Crystal Clear Entertainment,  keepin the old new Enjoy,I did
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Disturbing content, but amazing story, amazing photography and music make this movie a \\"must see\\" one.
B0010X8NF0|2.0|\\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" is a flop, a retread, a bore, and another sign that writer/director Wes Anderson can't press every character and story into his rigid template of cool detachment and visual irony. It's not even disappointing, really; you could see in Anderson's previous feature, \\"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,\\" this ambition to make just about any subject funnel into his bug jar of wondrous twigs, leaves and such. Never mind if it leaves the audience stuck in first gear, perpetually sizing up leery archetypes that seem stolen from that creepy brother Dan Futterman played in the TV show \\"Judging Amy.\\"  The characters in this India-by-train travel narrative are so flat and inert they become models in Anderson's moving diorama. What in the world are you supposed to do with them?     Yeah, \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" is a masterpiece. Was then, still is, gets better with age, one of the seminal works of the era, yessir, all that. (Spare us the anointing oil on \\"Rushmore\\" and \\"Bottle Rocket.\\") And for that, to Wes, we say thanks. \\"Tenenbaums\\" is also six years old, a perfect marriage of subject and tone, and somewhere in Anderson's wheelhouse. The guy got a bit self-satisfied with \\"The Life Aquatic\\" - not a terrible movie (endearing, even colorful) but more or less something you'd dream up in your backyard sandbox - but \\"Darjeeling\\" smacks of a half-baked idea cut squarely off at the knees (Anderson can't even be troubled to keep the titular train around for the second and third acts) crossed with the director's trademark muted sentiment and one of those hairpin turns into tragedy he likes so much.      Does \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" have a point? Oh, sure. It's same one Anderson's been making for years: Familial reconciliation, tinged with the complexity and bittersweetness of human nature. This time it's three brothers, one of whom is recovering from a severe car accident, on a bonding trip through the land that stopped Alexander The Great cold. The train is appropriately quirky, although Anderson's camera never lingers for too long, and there is no cuter-than-thou introduction to it. Francis (Owen Wilson) has arranged the trip for Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and Peter (Adrien Brody); he runs it on a supposedly tight itinerary he has printed out by his assistant, who stays in a different part of the train.    Jack's the cad, and a writer. Peter's the softy, and Francis is the control freak, an annoying trait that is no less so when we discover its roots.  The elephant in the room is their father's death; we can only guess at the trauma, because all three brothers hail from the \\"Oh. Wow.\\" factory of emotional output. This is, in fact, the Tenenbaum family poured into these fellows - like Richie crafted picture after picture of Margot, they glumly cling to their father's possessions, such as a 12-piece set of Louis Vuitton luggage.     The Anderson formula also includes some exotic, vaguely creepy foreign woman, smoking, the previously mentioned jarring transition, a dash of postmodern, story-within-a-story meta, Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray, and some music from The Kinks. Standard Wes fare.     In \\"Darjeeling,\\" none of it works. The random sex is crass, and the depiction of India, while not phony, is not terrible complete, either, seeing that the brothers spend most of their trip in the utter wilderness, where virtually no one lives. Anderson would have us believe Schwartzman has the looks and charm to attract women while the director buries Brody's natural electricity so he can play the \\"precious\\" brother. The roles should have been switched. Wilson's performance is supposed to be affecting because it came around the time of his suicide attempt; I guess I'm not so easily moved. His Francis is a particular irritant, both boorish and completely full of crap, easing off the gas pedal only after he's been lured into a fistfight. The brothers only seem that way in Jack's story-within-a-story, and, even then, we're not sure if it's an accurate evocation of their feelings, or just the middle brother's wishful thinking. Either way - who cares? \\"Anderson loses any non-conditioned member of the audience quickly in the first reel, tries a stab at pathos around halftime, and simply fritters about after that.     Note: \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" comes with a short film entitled \\"Hotel Chevalier,\\" a prologue featuring Jack and his ex-girlfriend, played by Natalie Portman. Esoteric and bewildering, it's kind of 13-minute scene a college student might write, enthusiastically graded by a fiction professor. It lacks any humor whatsoever and any noticeable warmth, but Portman quickly becomes naked and says a naughty word. For some reason, it still turns some weirdos on when a smart, bright kid like Portman shows how much she can't act against her essential nature by dragging her fingernails in dirt.
B00004VVN9|4.0|Along with movies like Silent Running and Blade Runner, Brainstorm is left in a malestrom of an unknown future which only the portal view of Douglas Trumball could only set in motion.  Though Blade Runner was made by an even excptional director, Ridley Scott, these two movies have been 'quietly' reveered by directors and 'ohmaged' by the other sci-fi action adventure directors that we see today.  I saw this movie when I was 17 and I am now 40 and I've come to notice the almost sterile brooding nature of the film even though a death of a famous actress is associated with it which took it away for the 'what if' aspect at the time of it's release in the early 80's.  I'd have to say if you took away that aspect of the finished product of the film and take it for what it is, i'd say that there could be a very HEALTHY re-make in line here and it could further bring thought to this subject which was taken off the table back when it was made.
B00102F5WK|2.0|Rendition\\" is comfort food for liberals, stacking the odds against the use of torture so significantly that, in its own arrogance, it probably makes a case for it. These kind of simpleminded rants are perfect fodder for a world of clever, contrary conservatives who love taking aim at artists who are Too Pure For This World.     However you feel on the matter is irrelevant to director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Kelley Sane, who present the viewer with the plight of a handsome Arab-American man who's beaten, stretched and drowned within an inch of his life over phone calls that were clearly not from a terrorist. There's no doubt of this. Not in one scene, including the prisoner's hilarious \\"confession.\\"     So the movie isn't about the validity of torture against a known or likely terrorist, but the inhumanity of it against a guy whose relatives have bad taste in cell phone peddlers. It's an exercise in rage against \\"the man,\\" to the point where a senatorial aide (Peter Sarsgaard) is 86d out of the film for correctly suggesting the prisoner's angry, pregnant wife (Reese Witherspoon) contact a lawyer when he's exhausted his own resources. As an ally, the aide is quickly replaced by the senator's secretary, who advises the wife stand in a hallway and scream at a shadowy CIA operative (Meryl Streep). Streep's character coos back a lame threat in (of course) a worthless Southern accent. Later, Witherspoon, so enormous she can only waddle about, collapses in an airport terminal to the pangs of birth.    Shameless much?     How about a subplot in which the beautiful daughter of a (presumably) Egyptian torturer/interrogator (Yigal Naor) runs away from home and falls in with a terrorist sympathizer whose very brother was tortured to death, the pictures of which are found in a scrapbook the boy frequently holds close to his chest? These star-crossed lovers are absurdly fit into the larger story of a suicide bomber who blows himself up in a market square, triggering an investigation by CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal).     Anwar El-Ibrihimi (Omar Metwally) is a chemical engineer coming back from a trip to South Africa. Upon arriving in Washington, he's hooded, handcuffed and whisked away to a room. The bomb's just exploded, and the guy claiming responsibility once owned a phone that was used to call Anwar. Anwar denies it, and is flown to North Africa for extraordinary rendition. That is, he is tortured for information he clearly does not have. He's electrocuted, punched, and subjected to water boarding. Whether you define these things as torture or not, the movie surely does, and, with Anwar's innocence not in question, the viewer has no choice to be sickened by the proceeding. What's worse - supporting the practice, or depicting it in such sensational, physical fashion while officially standing \\"against\\" it?    \\"Rendition\\" joins \\"The Life of David Gale\\" as one of those exercises so pathetic and obvious that only the proverbial \\"Kool-Aid drinker\\" - or someone who's not at all savvy about about movies - will find themselves suckered by the experience. No surprise that Gyllenhaal or Witherspoon are banging around in this tripe, but it is a minor surprise to see Arkin. Surely he doesn't need this - does he?
B0017M413M|4.0|If your a Stargate fan you will love this show. The visuals are stunning and the story was interesting. I can not help but feel that this film should have been the how the TV series (SC-FI Channel) finished instead of the final episode that was shown. I know there is another direct to dvd movie coming soon and I look forward to that. Hopefully this will be the first of many direct to dvd SG-1 episodes :O)
B00006AW2F|4.0|I was around when \\"Metamorphosis\\" came out in 1975, and I hated it then. Beginning with Goats Head Soup in 1972 RS IMO began an overall decline which has only been briefly relieved every five years or so by some good but flawed albums/cds, or some actual great singles off otherwise mediocre cds.) I think I was wrong.    Ssince that time I've come to appreciate Metamorphosis as a study in how the RS changed from their old blues covers and Brian Jones-influenced bluesy stuff into the flowering of the Glimmer Twins and their move to harder rock and roll. IMO it was in Jone's final 68-69 decline when he was less influential in the band that the famous \\"Rolling Stones sound\\" was established in the public's mind.     Metamorphosis is a quick education in early-middle period of Stones development. Tremendous changes can be heard not only in the song styles, but also the singling tone of Jagger. It's also fun listening for session sidemen like Jimmy Page and Stephen Still in their cuts.     So for the casual RS fan, this is more than likely a pass. But for the experienced and mature listener, it's great fun listening to the RS as they mature - well, as they mature musically at least.
B0000640SA|5.0|This movie totally slipped in under my radar.  I watched it at a friend's house and had to have it.  Memento is a masterpiece, and if you love amazing movies that make you think, this one is a keeper.      Sorry if this is lame, I'm not a pro reviewer.  If your IQ is over 90, and you can hold attention, then just buy it and enjoy. (It's that cheap)
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I think this is one of the best movies out so far this year, if not THE best. The inventive camera style, the plot, the intensity, all awesome. If you like monster movies, creative films, and don't get motion sick too easy, buckle up, you're in for an awesome ride.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|Robert Carsen's production is lovely with a successful blend of conservative and new ideas. I know this opera for years, and have quite a few recordings of it. But never before did its closing scene move me, as in this performance. This is mostly because of the singing and acting intensity of Hvorostovsky and Fleming.     Highly recommended.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I'm surprised at so many negative reviews.    Loved how this was filmed.  The camera does move a little too much, but it didn't bother me too much.    Not showing the monster very much was EXACTLY the way to go.  It made it more scary like in \\"Jaws\\", when you didn't see the shark very much.    Loved how there is no explanation of where, what and how this creature came to be.      And I didn't think the monster looked that much like one in \\"The Host\\".  I thought \\"The Host\\" was terrible anyway!
B0012UHSDO|5.0|Wow! I can't stop watching this show. The story is compelling and the acting is amazing.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I bought a few prenatal fitness videos so I would have variety.  This one would have to be the most challenging, which is good for me! I actually got a good work out from this one.  I am now 36 weeks pregnant with great blood pressure thanks to this workout that challenges moms-to-be. Other work out videos I hardly broke a sweat but this will keep me strong for labor!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|What can I say! if you loved the play, THIS CD IS A MUST!!!! The original Broadway cast and it doesn't get any better.  DO NOT HESITATE!!
1576754227|5.0|A brief, but very helpful work to help you help yourself. As with most (dare I say, all) self-motivational books, the ideas presented by Brian Tracy are not new, nor overly earth shattering, but they serve as great reminders and examples for how to get your life, and career back on track.<br /><br />The core analogy of the book is that the frog represents your biggest, most dreaded piece of work. Which incidentally, also often happens to be the most valuable piece of work - work that cannot be done by someone else - for any given day or project. Hence, by relentlessly focusing on 'eating the frog', you'll advance your career, and personal lives at a much quicker pace. But how do you get there? That's what the remainder of the book is all about - great read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|first let me say that I love Jillian from watching her on the Biggest Loser!  This is the first DVD of hers that I've purchased - started it on April 1st - so I am 21 days into it.  I just moved up to level 3 yesterday.  Very Intense.  I love the 3 circuits of the 3-2-1 approach - very effective.  This DVD will get your heartrate skyrocketing throughout the workout, Jillian is a GREAT motivator AND it is only 20 minutes!!!  The FAT is melting away!!  I love her approach - she is brutally honest - but it works!!  Worth every penny!
B0009IW88A|5.0|I couldn't possibly hope to write a review as eloquent as most of the others. I gather that I'm not the typical listener of music of this genre.<br /><br />There's really not much I can say about this soundtrack. Its artistry is beyond what words can describe, but how \\"beautiful\\" and \\"magnificant\\" will suffice.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Hans Zimmer since I bought the Gladiator soundtrack, on a whim. The pure enjoyment I've gotten out of the countless times I've listened to this CD, since I firt bought it, makes it probably my favorite of all of the CD's I own.
B00104QSOM|1.0|This is a terrible movie.  BORING!  Don't say you werent warned.  I cannot believe I stayed up to watch it - I guess I was hoping that the story would \\"catch\\" at some point but it just went on and on, and on, and on...............
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I'm a sucker for any kind of monster movie, and this one looked from the trailers to be fairly nasty. So even when the reviews came in that this was a feature-length gimmick in nauseating handheld with too little monster and too many yuppies--offset by some other reviews that said it was truly scary and that it's all a satire on precisely HOW moronic our single-minded consumer yuppies are today--I had to go see it for myself.<br /><br />This movie takes the Blair Witch Project idea [which, before that, was the Cannibal Holocaust idea] that what we're seeing is a videotape in the remains of some horrible catastrophe. Yes, the entire movie is in shaky, hand-cam video. We open in this fabulous loft in the Time Warner center. This is the apartment of Beth's dad, which she has just used to sleep with the vacuous Rob. It is he manning the camera, and he wakes Beth up with it and suggests they spend the day at Coney Island, which she has never been to. Then suddenly we're at this party a few months later--the earlier footage was stuff that was taped over for what we're seeing here. It's a fairly clever way to work flashbacks into the story with the stricture that we only see what the video sees. We are now at Rob's going-away party, as he is shipping off for a job in Japan. Rob's brother is taking the video, but soon recruits the blabbermouth moron Hud to assume duties, going around the party and taping video testimonials to what a sweet dude Rob is, Bro. Also on hand are Rob's brother's girlfriend Lily, and a woman Marlene, who clearly wants Hud to leave her alone so she can devote her full attention to her cell phone.<br /><br />So Beth shows up at the party with a date, and Rob, who has not seen or even called her since they slept together, that once, is angry and at one point implies that she's a slut for having a date, months later, with a guy who presumably calls her and is not moving to Japan. Okay, so Rob is a total tool. He gets worse. And ladies and gentlemen, this is your main character.<br /><br />Hud tapes Rob and Beth having a private conversation [tool!], then goes inside and spreads the news that they slept together to everyone [tool!]. There's a shot of Rob giving a speech that is interrupted by some other people taping it on their phones and such, and you wonder if this is a comment on our cameras-everywhere documentary society, and perhaps the people who seem only to be able to experience life through the interface of an electronic device. And of course, here we are in the audience, voyeurs watching their experience. Woah: indicted, dude. Totally, bro!<br /><br />So all of a sudden the lights go out and everyone runs up to the roof, where they see a huge explosion downtown. Then they all run down to the street, where the head of the Statue of Liberty lands nearby, followed by a stream of smoke that it an exact replica of certain 9/11 footage. Our heroes are all like, totally freaked, and end up trying to get across the Brooklyn Bridge to escape. While on it, Rob gets a cell phone call from Beth, alone in her dad's apartment at 59th street, and tries to talk to her as the bridge collapses and his brother is killed. They then run back to Lower Manhattan. Across from them, people are looting an electronics store, and Rob wanders in, looking for a battery for his phone so he can call Beth back, while ignoring the extreme danger and his friends' entreaties and the reality that his brother just died. He finds a battery, attempts to call, then decides that he must make his way up to rescue Beth, that girl he slept with once.<br /><br />Okay, so are we to understand that Rob is psychotic? He barely knows this woman, seems barely phased by the fact that his brother just died, is ignoring imminent peril, and is about to set off on an idiotic quest to rescue someone who will surely be dead by the time he arrives. I'm still not sure if we're supposed to find this all terribly brave and romantic, because all the signs point toRob having lost his mind.

B000WM725C|5.0|This is not an official release by any means, nor is it as some seem to think, the same concert as the Rust Never Sleeps film, but rather a different concert at the same venue 6 days later. These are not the same performances but it is an excellent performance well worthy of release.    However, Neil and co. NEVER RELEASED THIS. This is a BOOTLEG. Keep that in mind before you decide to spend money on it.
0743496736|3.0|After reading My sisters Keeper, I was so excited to get into another Picoult book! The description of the book seemed great, but I found myself knee deep in character development for like some 300 pages, and then the book seemed like it was over! The characters at time seemed cliche, and the detail into the characters just seemed to go on for so long. I found myself forcing to read at night just so I could get on to my next book. Definatly not a favorite, but I have not given up on Picoult! The next in my list in the Pact, and so far it is looking promising :)
6305064490|5.0|For many, \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" is a staple to their holiday traditions.  With all major networks vying to get their hands on this mediocre blockbuster, this little film transforms from ordinary to cult status every holiday.  As a viewer, outside of the final act, this Jimmy Stewart classic is more than just a Christmas movie, but instead a powerful Capra film that demonstrates an America from long ago.  It shows a small-town America, without the plowed Wal-Mart roads or big-box makeovers.  For this critic, it demonstrates the power of independent business, and why we may never find this type of service ever again.  As an independent, downtown shop owner of about a year and a half myself; \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" transformed this viewing from holiday pastime to dedicated film exposing the corruptive nature of capitalism as well as the realism of independent business.  With this change in tact, Jimmy Stewart's words become more emotional, Donna Reed's actions become more honest, and our little Christmas film transforms into a man's journey to search for himself.  I cannot denounce that this is a holiday film, Stewart screams \\"Merry Christmas\\" throughout the entire ending, but before that final conclusion there are about two hours of small town America and one man's struggle to escape.  \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" is a powerful blend of realism and fantasy, individualism and community, dreams and truth, as well as frustration and joy.  The cast is superbly placed in their respective roles and Capra's action behind the camera stands boldly in place.  This is not just a movie, but an experience coupled with foreshadowing - giving George not just a glimpse of a world without him - but also a glimpse of a world without small business<br /><br />\\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", the film itself, is beautifully crafted.  With new editions being released each season, one can easily see the crisp beauty of Capra's image.  Its characters; George Bailey, Mary, Sam Wainright, Potter, Bert and Ernie, and even Clarence seem to jump from the screen, giving us imaginative citizens to this quaint town of Bedford Falls.  Capra not only gives these characters spirits and souls, but also the town.  Capra built three blocks of Bedford Falls so that he could capture the honesty of the town that Stewart so adamantly wanted to leave - and upon doing this gave this little town a soul of its own.  Watching this film, Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey runs the gambit of powerhouse acting.  Stewart, freshly back from the war, was worried if he could carry the weight of Bailey's cynicism.  His ability to care for Bedford Falls, while always dreaming of wanting to escape could only be portrayed through Stewart's Americana eyes.  When he screams at Mary, denouncing his desire to be on the ground floor in plastics, or when he yells at Potter's bid to join him - we scream with him.  This film works from an acting standpoint because we believe in the characters - we trust the actors to give us a slice of their souls for these roles - and they do.  One cannot fault anyone in this film for their acting and that is a rarity in today's Hollywood.<br /><br />Capra's eye in this film seems far more advanced than the credit he has received.  His enormous sets, the birth of a new \\"snow\\", and his ability to create a world we care for without having to travel the globe.  What I enjoy about \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" is that Capra tricks you by the end.  Here we believe, outside of the brief opening, that this is just your typical drama, a man's life is shown in scope so that he can see his full worth, but then sneakily Capra brings in (depending on your religious basis) a huge science-fiction element that was unheard of during the time.  One cannot argue the validity of science fiction vs. religion in this film - since Joseph is portrayed by the stars and planets.  Sure, Clarence was an angel, but there is this aura of the supernatural.  Clarence offers no evidence that he is, in fact, sent by the man upstairs, so one has to question the time this film was released, the faith in spirituality, and the fact that Capra's Clarence could be alien, vegetable, or mineral.  This film teeters between drama and science fiction, while so many critics award this film the \\"feel-good\\" holiday movie during December; I find it a bit strange that perhaps this film lead to so many other science fiction movies of the same nature.  Perhaps the \\"Cloverfield\\" monster could be considered a Clarence to someone in New York City?  I may be stretching a bit, but what pulls me into this film time and time again is the fact that Clarence is not of Earth, yet George easily believes.  He listens, follows, and - with some resistance - does what Clarence orders.  This is a film without guns, without explosions, without the President getting on his red phone - but instead a film where a celestial being can visit someone without fear, anger, or confusion.  This is why I collect the \\"Alf\\" television series.<br /><br />Overall, \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" remains in constant rotation no matter the time of year in my home.  The acting is superb, the sci-fi element seems fresh every time, and the growing fact that George Bailey is pro-independent business means quite a bit in this rushed Wal-Mart world.  Bailey, and this film, is the voice for the little man, the quiet shopkeeper who doesn't want to sell to Potter, but instead dreams of keeping their home-style values.  The spark between Potter and Bailey can be seen in every facet of today's growing world, as the rich continue to get richer - the less fortunate work harder and feel more held back.  Dreams are traded for jobs - communities are strengthened by friendships.  This film is a time capsule for the future, as we discover convenience overcomes customer service; it is nice to look back and see a world like Bedford Falls.  The science fiction element to this film, yep - that is what I am considering it - comes in sharp and remains powerful throughout.  Did anyone else see Jimmy Stewart's eyes throughout those scenes?  Brilliant!  While this film will remain a staple through the holidays, I persist that you watch it away from the holiday to see the real message behind the film.  Capra was a genius in creating this film, and subsequently crafted a cult film that will remain forever.  Even today, nearly thirty years since my first viewing, I am more impressed that ever.  It is a film that grows with you, and that is quite a rarity in today's cinema.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****man upstairs, so one has to question the time this film was released, the faith in spirituality, and the fact that Capra's Clarence could be alien, vegetable, or mineral.

B00082ZS5W|5.0|Excellent product, for the DVD as well as for the CD. Good quality, for the sound as well as for the images. All the good songs are there and of course, Dido is gorgeous.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I've listened to a lot of DVD commentaries before, and I'd have to say this is easily one of the best.  Between the cast and crew, there are enough bits of trivia, hilarious anecdotes and behind-the-scenes factoids (technical and otherwise, like the hurdles overcome to get the film made) to keep just about any listener enthralled for the entire length of the movie.  It could have been better with Sigourney and Paul Reiser included, but their absence isn't as conspicuous as you'd think since they are talked about plenty (all positively, of course).    The bonus disc is also interesting, but similar to the extras on \\"T2: Judgment Day,\\" they are exhaustive and exhausting.  Whereas most DVDs don't go into enough detail, I think Cameron's go into too much.  These at least aren't presented in text form as they were on \\"T2,\\" which was enormously tedious. It was really great to see the actors all these years later, including Carrie \\"Newt\\" Henn all grown up.      As special editions go, I'd say this one is worth every penny (even if bought at full retail).  It's pretty rare to find a commentary that's almost more entertaining than the movie itself, but this absolutely is.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|There are very few movies that have come out that have been both humerous and great. Superbad was indeed a good comedy, but it pales in comparison to Juno both in comedy and in content. Juno looks at realistic sitsuations that teens face and combines this with the comedic time of Ellen Page that is nothing short of genius. Add in te talent of actors like Jennifer Garner and Jason Stathem and you have the right combination to make a hit movie. Newcomer Diablo Cody has created a movie that will last for the ages.
0307388840|5.0|Part One of this novel is slow going.  Had I not trusted the author from reading a previous book (Saturday), I might not have continued.  This would have been a travesty.  Part Two picked up the action and intensity in the war scenes, and Part Three tied it all together with one of the most elegant, haunting and surprising endings I've experienced.<br /><br />After experiencing the ending, you will realize that Part One had to be written the way it was for the book to have resonated so powerfully.  It laid the necessary groundwork for development of the novel's themes: reality versus perception, honesty versus artistic creativity, and real life versus fictional creation.<br /><br />I watched the movie after reading the novel and was also impressed with the film adaptation.  Beautiful cinematography, great acting, and a good sense of time and place.  The movie did, however, feel choppier than the novel, as it was harder to blend the three parts into one seamless narrative as well as Mcewan did.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Bridge Over Troubled Water is an outstanding, classic rock album from Simon and Garfunkel. These guys knew music and they played and sang so well that they remain very famous even after their split so many years ago. The sound quality is excellent and the artwork is very thoughtfully done.<br /><br />The CD starts with the title track, \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\" They sing this beautifully and there is such a soothing quality to this rock ballad that you just can't resist it! \\"Bridge Over Troubled water\\" has an especially fine arrangement for the piano and this helps the melody along quite a bit. \\"El Condor Pasa (If I Could)\\" has another very pretty melody for this considerably shorter ballad; Paul Simon sings this flawlessly and the flute is gorgeous on \\"El Condor Pasa (If I Could).\\" Great!<br /><br />\\"Cecilia\\" rocks! This tune gives us Simon and Garfunkel singing out loud about a girl who can break a man's heart and not feel terribly bad at all about it. The beat is quite good for this song and it all holds its own very well. \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\" is a lesser known ballad but it's really very well done; and the use of both major and minor keys enhances the natural beauty of this ballad.<br /><br />\\"The Boxer\\" is one of their greatest hits ever--I always enjoy this even if I know there may be hidden meanings in the lyrics that I still don't understand. Simon and Garfunkel harmonize to perfection and the percussion helps to mark the best very well. I predict that you'll enjoy \\"The Boxer\\" very much if you haven't heard it already.<br /><br />\\"The Only Living Boy In New York\\" puzzles me because despite its beauty it's not a song that gets the full; recognition it deserves. Simon and Garfunkel sing this without a flaw and \\"The Only Living Boy In New York\\" is clearly a highlight of this album.<br /><br />Just as Amazon notes, we also get a live cover of The Everly Brothers' \\"Bye Bye Love.\\" Simon and Garfunkel put their own stamp on this great ballad by changing a few keys here and there and it works wonders for this number. I love it!<br /><br />\\"Feuilles-O\\" is an excellent bonus track on this album; and listen for a bonus track of another slightly different recoding of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\" This demo works well but I think the final version worked best.<br /><br />Overall, Simon and Garfunkel fans will want this for their collections; and people who enjoy classic rock and even some of the \\"oldies\\" will cherish this CD for years to come.s wonders for this number.

B0013FBS20|5.0|The Movie is just amazing.  It is one of my favorite movies in my blu-ray collection.

B000YABYLA|5.0|The screwball comedy was a staple in theaters when movies first discovered sound. The antics of Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart and a ton of other actors made audiences laugh and weep and in general have a good time at the box office. This genre comes to life once more with the release of JUNO.<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) is a typical teen for the most part. As opposed to most films that center the attention around the cheerleader (face it, percentage wise how many teens are actually cheerleaders?), Juno is a normal student who has a strong attachment to her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). So much so that she seduces him and the two share their first intimate moment with one another. With, for them, unexpected results.<br /><br />Yes, Juno ends up pregnant. She lets her parents in on what has happened and the pair offers her support as opposed to verbal abuse. Visiting a local abortion clinic, she thinks twice and decides instead to have the baby. Their support helps her to locate a nice couple seeking to adopt in an upper middle class home.<br /><br />As Juno's pregnancy continues, she keeps in touch with the couple, letting them know what's going on. She also begins to bond with the husband (Jason Bateman) who she shares interests with in music and movies.  The wife (Jennifer Garner) just sees Juno as the mother carrying the child that she so desperately wants.<br /><br />As the film progresses, we are given a look at this young lady who is facing a crisis in a more level headed manner than we would expect, not only from those in real life but from film lives as well. Juno jokes about her pregnancy, sarcastically spills out about her less than supportive boyfriend and discusses life in general. She is one of the most well rounded characters seen on film in some time and it was a delight to glimpse this life.<br /><br />The film progresses to a point where we discover all is not well with the \\"perfect family\\" Juno has chosen for her child. It's a revelatory moment that affects not only the couple involved but Juno as well. It's a discovery that the world is a difficult place to find perfection in no matter how much you desire it.<br /><br />The ending of the film is fantastic. No quick solutions, no movie filled dream sequence where everything turns out the way a Hollywood writer would want it to be. No, this time we are offered a chance to see a real solution where there is a happy ending, just not the one you expected.<br /><br />This low budget gem arrived in theaters and was hailed by critics and fans alike and understandably so. It feels fresher than anything seen in months, perhaps years. The look of the film is great, the direction is top notch and the acting is some of the best seen lately. Low key when needed and abrupt at others, all of the actors involved deserve notices for a job well done.<br /><br />Outstanding from the rest is Page as Juno. Having made a name for herself in the revenge drama HARD CANDY, she shows a different side here in the smart mouthed, in over her head Juno. She carries off this character as if she were portraying herself rather than someone written. It is her performance that centers this film and makes it a gift.<br /><br />JUNO is not your typical pregnant teen flick. It's more than that. It's a glimpse of life as it is, life as it can be as opposed to the two options most Hollywood films offer of dysfunctional families of happy ever after marriages.

B0015I2P0Y|4.0|In my view, Elbow has been not received the attention they've deserved, neglected and passed by as the spotlight has shown instead on similarly innovative countrymen Radiohead and Coldplay.  Perhaps their excellent new CD will change that.  The Seldom Seen Kid moves from songs filled with Pink Floydian grandeur (ex., \\"the Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver\\"), to Beatlesque sing-alongs (\\"One Day Like This\\") and a lot of quality material along the way.  The arrangements are stunning, including an extremely effective use of keyboards and synths.  There is an interesting variety of musical moods including the dark carnival ride of \\"The Fix,\\" a relatively straight-ahead blues rocker (the mighty \\"Grounds for Divorce\\") and a couple of gloomy widescreen ballads.  This new Elbow recording is so good it's made me want to go back and reassess their previous works.  It's one of the better things I've heard so far in '08.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Chris McCandless was not unlike myself at his age.  He knew what had been thrown at him his whole life and wanted to experience anything but that for a while.  I suppose we all go through these feelings and transitions and each individual handles it in a different way.<br /><br />He was intuitive, sensitive, educated, empathetic, confused, intelligent, and thoughtful.  His physical and spiritual journey brought him to places where he wanted to be.  I perceive him to be a great person, infectious and irresistible, even charasmatic.  He had to do what he had to do.<br /><br />I wholly admire the film because it portrayed a person on a spiritual journey....a true story, and I think Penn did a fantastic job painting this picture.  The cast was also perfect and each fit into their role \\"perfectly\\".<br /><br />The tragedy lies in the fact that the young man died so young.  Ok, maybe it was because of ignorance when it comes to living in the wild.  Maybe it was because it played out exactly was it was supposed to.  Maybe it was intentional, but I think not.  He was searching and he found it.  No one can say what scratches the itch of those who seek.  Right or wrong, smart or stupid, weak or strong.  Chris did it \\"his way\\".  I admire his courage and fortitude to step outside the box.<br /><br />I shudder to think of what this man would be doing now, at 40.  He was a sharp mind, learning how to use itself, a bright light hiding under a bushel basket.  Perhaps his decisions didn't help him, but they helped all of us didn't they?  I think he'd like that.<br /><br />Highly recommended movie.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I can't allow myself to call this film a comedy.<br /><br />Certainly Benigni brilliantly contrasts his warm Italian personality to the cold and ruthless Nazis. A humorous contrast, but I found it to be nothing to laugh at.<br /><br />As a father, I almost couldn't bring myself to watch this film--I can't bear the thought of a child in such peril, but, I'm now glad I did.<br /><br /> I felt the constant tension that Benigni's character, Guido must have felt as he perpetuated his lighthearted rouse for his innocent young son. At any given time, his son could have been discovered. He cleverly extends himself through his own heartbreaking fear to shield his son and send comfort to his wife incarcerated in another part of the camp.<br /><br />The contrast continues as his son relays stories of children disappearing and people being made into soap and burned in furnaces and Guido responds with a laughing dismissal.  I felt relief as his son disobeyed his father when Guido told him to stop resisting and go take a shower with the other children.  Only from our perspective of history can we know what would have been in store for the child.<br /><br />Life is Beautiful is a magnificent story.  Although, it does not delve deeply into the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust, it doesn't need to. It brings home the fact that humans are capable of terrifying coldness without the graphic horrors.  It serves well as a reminder of the Holocaust.<br /><br />Benigni is as human and beautiful as the Nazis are animalistic and ugly.<br /><br />Please, watch this film and remember what we must never forget.
0618918248|3.0|I've read this book 3 times through, and each time I've approached it from a different angle. For those looking to blindly bolster your personal desires to remove God from the picture, this book will succeed. A more careful reading of this offering from Dawkins will reveal a different outcome however.     You'll notice a few severe failings in the arguments presented here. Dawkins offers no explanation for the origin of moral decision making, yet says that God is not needed to have such standards. He also asserts that the vast majority of scientists (and academics in general) are either atheistic or agnostic, and that those numbers decline as you move down the rungs of education. This is analogous to arguing that the summer makes people drown. No, more people swim during the summer, and so while the risk has not increased, the number of people that COULD drown has. The secular academic circles actively remove those of faith.     At the center of this book is the idea that personal experience is not sufficient for \\"proof\\" since we have a sophisticated brain that infers pattern when there is none. Yet there are no references supporting this. We are to take him at his word. And then he punts on the problem of multiple witness miracles by simply saying that they are difficult to explain away.     Finally, a classic problem with this book and most other attempts to subvert faith, is the question as to the motive behind the author's actions. If people are in fact convincing themselves of a lie, then this assumes that there are in fact truths (which is a different topic all together). Most atheists are moral relativists in that they cannot assign ultimate meaning to anything regarding our \\"accidental\\" existence. On these grounds nothing has purpose beyond a proximal (and ultimately falsified), subjectively attributed meaning. But we know better than this because we can identify the lie. Atheists KNOW that their lives are without purpose. So why bother those that have convinced themselves of a lie that assigns purpose to their lives, when this in fact precisely what Dawkins is doing? Read carefully and you'll find other horrific contradictions.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|I feel it would be pretty difficult to compile all the Depeche Mode hits onto a single disc, and I was right. Obviously there are some missing tracks on here, and maybe a few that could have been left off, but I understand that you just can not appease everyone. I do think that this is a great representation of their career however, and it is a very impressive career so that was no small feat. This would be a great place for people new to the band to start, as you could get a taste of their many facets, and as a long time fan, I can also appreciate many of my favorites being in one convenient place. Excellent compilation.

0743454537|4.0|Jodi Picoult has a real talent for taking an issue that may seem cut and dried and then showing the reader all the gray areas that make the issue infinitely more complex than it may seem.  She also excels at telling a story from multiple viewpoints so that the reader gets a sense of how one single event can affect people in a myriad of ways.    My Sister's Keeper centers on Anna, who, at the age of thirteen, decides to sue her parents for medical emancipation.  Anna has not only served as a donor for her leukemia-stricken sister Kate, she was, in fact, the product of genetic engineering that guaranteed she would be a perfect match for Kate.  This premise touches on many of the issues that affect modern day science, from designer babies to the ethics involved in cloning.  Picoult gives no answers as to whether it's right or wrong for a child to be conceived for this purpose.  Anna's presence is what it is and it is for the reader to decide.    Though the story of Anna and Kate is central to the novel, Picoult also provides the reader with the point of view of Sara, the two girls' mother.  Sara's position is one that no parent would envy and about which every parent has nightmares and Picoult does a masterful job of showing how Sara's quest to try to save Kate becomes an obsession that threatens her ability to really see just what effect it has on every other member of the family.    The novel is also told from the perspective of Brian, the father of the two girls.  He is a parent torn between his two children, wanting what is best for the both of them and knowing that there is no way for either of them to have what's best.  He is also caught between his children and his wife for though he feels as deeply as Sara, he is able to see things with a bit more clarity than she is.    Jesse Fitzgerald, the last member of the family, also has his say in the novel and his is the story of what it's like to be the healthy brother of a sister who is so perilously unhealthy.  It'seasy to see why he acts as he does and Picoult draws his desperation very clearly.  He's not truly part of this equation because he can't do anything for his sister.  Instead, he must bear witness to Kate's and Anna's trials and is expected to put aside his own wants and needs because the needs of Kate are always paramount.    Lastly, the story is also told from the perspective of Campbell, Anna's lawyer, and Julia, who is appointed Anna's guardian ad litem.  The two have a history of their own and though their story is secondary to the main plot, it is similar in that it is also a tale of human alienation and how the very human need to protect those we love can actually hurt them far more deeply than our indifference.  Campbell is also something of a mystery due to the presence of his service dog and his refusal to say exactly why he needs the dog.  Instead, he has a stock of ready-made sarcastic reasons that are quite humorous.    What is strongest about this novel is Picoult's ability to play the heartstrings.  She has a very deep understanding of what drives humans and so the psychology of the novel drives very close to home.  What I did not like about it, though, was the ending, which I found rather too convenient.  After creating such a complex and morally ambiguous tale, her ending seemed something of a cop out.  Still, overall this is a compulsively readable novel that I finished in two days and that I did not want to put down.

B00005LK95|4.0|What to do now there's no more Short Circuit movies to watch? Why was there never a third? And why, apart from Johnny 5, was Fisher Stevens the only original character brought back?<br /><br />Those were only minor quibbles for a great movie. And the god awful cover art, which the more I look at, the more I hate. But then they could have done worse. It could have been a white background with the two main characters photoshopped in.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first Short Circuit movie. The second? Even better. With more fun from Johnny, including even more interaction with Ben (Fisher Stevens), and more fun-ness, including making the toy Johnny 5's dance, and more, Short Circuit betters the first.<br /><br />I was kinda disappointed that Stephany didn't reappear for the second movie, she was a bit of a miss, and was only mentioned a couple of times, apart from a voice recording - but at least she wasn't completely forgotten about.<br /><br />What's good about reading other reviewer's ... reviews is that the amount of people is saw this when they were young. I always seem to get introduced to these movies a lot later in life - for example I'm a nearly mid-twenty something and seeing this for the first time. What would it have been like to see it as a child? That, I can only dream about.<br /><br />Short Circuit 2 pretty much follows on from the first, with Ben now in the big city, trying to sell his toy Johnny's on the street, next to a fake Rolex selling vendor. A toy buyer, Sandy, stumbles across a toy Johnny after it 'escapes' and brings it back. Talk of money is banded about, and next thing Ben knows, he needs to make 1000, in 31 days. With the fake Rolex selling vendor, Fred (Michael McKean) as his partner. But bad guys want to break into a bank to steal some priceless jewels, but how are they going to do it? The rest is predictable, but fun.<br /><br />Jack Weston appears as one of the bad guys, who befriends Johnny, in order to get him on his side, finding out he is incredibly naive. For any eighties rom-com fan will recognise him from Dirty Dancing, as Max Kellerman. (For anyone who hasn't seen this or Dirty Dancing, boy do you need some education!) Short Circuit 2 actually appears to have been Jack Weston's last movie before he died from lymphoma in 1996.<br /><br />I'm disappointed there was never another Short Circuit movie. And another one. And another one. And another one. It could have been a great franchise. But what's good is normally best left to a minimum, before it loses its glow.

0374105235|4.0|When reading this book, one must keep some distance between oneself and the narrative, to not be overwhelmed by the horrors that are described. Fortunately, the writing style helps the reader maintain this distance. Writing in a very matter of fact style, perhaps even too matter of factly, Beah describes his efforts to avoid getting pulled into the civil war in Sierra Leone and his actions when he is eventually \\"recruited\\" to join the army.    The bulk of this book is quite bleak, by necessity. But Beah shows a talent for story-telling throughout, especially in the more hopeful sections of the book, when he describes his life before the civil war struck his village and after his \\"rehabilitation\\".
1416524800|3.0|On one hand I enjoyed this book and read through it in a very short time. On the other hand...The author and the book want to present themselves as technologically advanced and accurate. I know quite a bit about flying / aviation and therefore I was surprised at the gross errors I read whenever helicopters / aircraft / weapon systems were mentioned (I could cite a whole bunch of examples but that's not the point). Kind of makes you wonder if the guy has ever seen the inside of a jet fighter or knows the *basics* of helicopter flight. And if these references are full of mistakes, it makes you think that the rest of the story is just as poorly researched / founded.<br /><br />Kinda disappointing really.
0743496736|5.0|Nineteen Minutes is the first novel of Jodi Picoult's that I have read and I was very pleased with the book.  I loved how I could identify completely with each character in a variety of ways.  I was taken back to my own experiences with bullying in school and my own struggle to fit in with the \\"right crowd.\\"  I found myself clinging especially to the stories of the parents involved and how they looked back on and forward to raising their children.  I have no doubt that most anyone can identify in atleast some way with Picoult's well written characters and the issues they encounter.<br /><br />I read through the book very quickly because I did not want to put it down and leave these characters.  Nineteen Minutes is an excellently compelling story and was a very entertaining read, but I was disappointed with the end \\"twist.\\"  I could see the plot resolution coming from about chapter 4, so wasn't surprised with how the story ended at all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I received my copy about 6 days ago and have done workout #1 five times. I really like it. I won't repeat the other reviews (which by experience are quite accurate-and should be read) but here are a few things that I don't think anyone mentioned that I really like.     -It goes by very quickly. I know everyone says its short but really it flies by faster than any other workout I do or have done. I get bored easy and it is over before I can talk myself into blowing off the workout or quitting early. I also feel like I get an effective workout for my time (especially my neglected arms and abs).     - It can be done in a small space. My apartment is SMALL. I have had problems with videos in the past that require a whole room's worth of space to go back and forth (which I do not have).     - (based only on the first workout) the exercises often incorporate the hand weights (o-yea you need hand weights which I don't think is mentioned anywhere here) This means that the intensity can be changed easily up or down by changing the amount of weight.     I really enjoy this video and received exactly what I expected based on the reviews and I am very happy with my purchase.

630018448X|4.0|I recently saw this episode for the first time and enjoyed it.<br /><br />I expected it to be poor, because I'd heard the show is at its weakest when the Fleet encounters inhabited human planets, which violates the basic premise of the show.  I would counterargue that the fleet starts meeting humans beyond the main Colony worlds as early as the second episode, when they visit the Ovion casino on Carellon.  Indeed, considering that the Colonies were starfaring civilizations, it would be odd if the fleet did not encounter small \\"island\\" socities of humans like this.  Presumably, the reason they keep trudging along towards Earth rather than stopping in such places is that 1) they don't want to lead the Cylons to such tiny undefended worldlets, and 2) they assume Earth to be a much bigger, major colony that can both accept a huge influx of refugees and defend itself against Cylon attack.  (Heh heh, are they ever in for a nasty surprise.  Alas, Galactica 1980...)<br /><br />A second strike against this story is the rather silly \\"wild west\\" aesthetic (metal cowboy hats, sigh).  But again, is that really any more unlikely than the disco-themed casino on Carellon?  If one is okay, the other is okay.  Personally, I found the forced wild west stuff in this episode sufficiently understated that I could overlook it.  It's just a tiny and fairly low-tech human society.  That's good enough for me.<br /><br />I thought the basic plot was a good one.  Apollo runs into some Cylon fighters while on patrol.  He successfully leads them away from the Fleet, but after doing so runs low on fuel, so he has to set down on the nearest planet.  To his surprise, he finds a tiny human settlement there.  To his greater surprise, he finds that they are being terrorized by a single Cylon centurion the locals call Redeye.  It baffles him why a Cylon would be oppressing and extorting from humans rather than simply killing them, and moreover cannot believe that a single Cylon would be here acting completely alone.  Although he could kill the centurion (he has a laser pistol, while the locals only have weak pneumatically powered guns), he is afraid that doing so would draw the wrath of the larger Cylon force which he assumes must be nearby.  Meanwhile, the Fleet must try to locate him.  All good stuff.  And, as another reviewer pointed out, this episode has some of the best acting performances of the series.gh he could kill the centurion (he has a laser pistol, while the locals only have weak pneumatically powered guns), he is afraid that doing so would draw the wrath of the larger Cylon force which he assumes must be nearby.

0060899220|4.0|Bourdain's book manages to perfectly capture the essence and the ideas of what it means to work in the restaurant business.      I always romanticized the idea of slinging great plates and creating godlike feasts, but hearing the harrowing, hillarious, and downright frightening tales told in this book made me think otherwise.    Welcome to the world of practical jokes, psychos, thieves, hellhole places, clueless owners, broken down plumbing, just about every drug-addiction you can name of characters in the world told in flourishing colour.  Get inside the head of why most people who go out to eat don't know jack, and why the business fails most of the time.    The updated version is also a good time point, because as Bourdain mentions, being a chef now is a big difference than when he was in the 70's.  It's all changing now with TV and celebrity, and here you have a guy who is still fighting it out in the trenches giving you the inside scoop.    What a cruel crazy beautiful world this book is.  It brought back many great and bad memories of my past kitchen experiences when I was a teen, nothing on the league of what these guys/gals are in.      I always remembered when I was younger at an early age to judge a restaurant by how clean their bathrooms are.  It's all true trust me on that, and I smilled gleefully when I read this as one of Bourdain's tips.    More importantly this book will leave you ravenously hungry.  I suggest you eat it up!
B00104QSOM|5.0|In the audacious opening shot of his magnificent, sprawling, demented epic, \\"There Will Be Blood\\", director P.T. Anderson presents us with a tracking shot of a vast expanse of rocky, desolate scrub land, scored by an ominous, discordant drone. When the camera (literally) disappears down a hole, we are introduced to the story's protagonist, a lone, shadowy figure, chiseling away at the subterranean rock wall of a derelict well with a fierce, single-minded determination. There is nary a word of dialogue uttered during the ensuing 15 minutes or so of screen time; yet through the masterful implementation of purely cinematic language, we are given a sufficient enough glimpse so as to feel that we may already have some inkling of what it is that drives this man, even though we do not yet even know his name. Stylistically, this scene is more than a little reminiscent of the prologue for \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". What we witness in the film's introduction may not be quite as profound or seminal as Kubrick's rendering of \\"the dawn of man\\", but it does put the spotlight on something just as primeval. It is something that is buried deep within the capitalist DNA-the relentless drive to amass wealth and power through willful exploitation and opportunism (hey, don't knock it- it's what made this country great!)    Flash forward a few years, and we find that our mystery man not only has a name, but has made a name for himself in the midst of California's turn-of-the-century oil boom. The ambitious Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) has moved up from prospecting for precious metals to leasing tracts of land for the oil drilling rights. He is well on his way to becoming a very wealthy man. He did not get to this place in his life by being a nice guy (who does?). He is a bachelor; but in order to give an impression as a sincere \\"family man\\", he totes a young orphan along to business meetings, who he introduces as his son (not unlike Ryan and Tatum O'Neal's con artist team in \\"PaperMoon\\"). In his worldview, you are either with him, or you are his \\"competitor\\". In fact, Plainview is the quintessential lone wolf, having very little tolerance or use for people in general, unless they can help him further his agenda.     Plainview's biggest payday arrives in the form of a furtive and enigmatic young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), who walks out of the desert one day with a hot tip about a possible oil field that lies beneath his family's central California ranch land. Everything appears to be going swimmingly until Plainview crosses paths with Sunday's twin brother Eli (also played by Dano) a fire and brimstone evangelical who sees his family's business partnership with Plainview as a potential cash cow for building up his ministry. The relationship between these two characters forms the heart of the story's conflict.         Plainview and Sunday are in reality two peas in a pod; they both employ their own fashion of charlatanism and manipulation to get what they want. They circle each other warily, grudgingly accepting that they need each other to achieve their goals. Plainview sees himself as an empire builder, and promises the milk and honey of economic prosperity to sway the landowners to his way of thinking. The somewhat unhinged Sunday envisions himself as a prophet, and uses the lure of eternal life and the theatrics of faith healing to win over his followers. He clearly sees (plainly views?) Plainview as the Devil; this is proffered by the director in one of the film's most stunning visual moments, where Anderson frames Day-Lewis in ominous silhouette against the hellish backdrop of an oil well fire, recalling the image of Chernabog in the \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" segment from \\"Fantasia\\". I also think it is significant to note that when we are first introduced to Plainview, he emerges from underground (the Underworld?). The resulting confilict between prophet and profiteer makes for a compelling tale.    The story spans thirty years; culminating on the eve of the Depression, by which time the obscenely wealthy but completely soulless Plainview has morphed into a reclusive Charles Foster Kane type figure, alone in his mansion. The film's jaw-dropping climatic scene is destined to be dissected and argued over by film buffs for some years to come.    The story is rich in allegory; especially in the character of Plainview, who is the very personification of the blood-soaked history of profit-driven expansionism in America (and it goes without saying that the particular brand of puritanical religious zealotry represented by Sunday has been responsible for its fair share of damage throughout U.S. history as well). This film reminded me, oddly enough, of the excellent documentary \\"The Corporation\\", in which the filmmakers build a psychological profile of the typical corporation, as if it were a person. The summation from that film's official website says:    \\"To assess the `personality' of the corporate `person,' a checklist is employed, using diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization and the standard diagnostic tool of psychiatrists and psychologists. The operational principles of the corporation give it a highly anti-social `personality': it is self-interested, inherently amoral, callous and deceitful; it breaches social and legal standards to get its way; it does not suffer from guilt, yet it can mimic the human qualities of empathy, caring and altruism.\\"    That works for me as a profile of Plainview, and to some extent, Sunday as well. The famously dedicated and meticulous Day-Lewis is nothing short of astonishing in his role. I dare say it is one of his finest performances to date. He does make some interesting choices; especially in his carefully measured vocal inflection. I swear that he is uncannily channeling the voice of the late Jack Palance. But it works-and maybe it's not such a stretch, since director Anderson appears to be channeling the mythic style of George Stevens' westerns(\\"Giant\\", obviously; and in a tangential sense, \\"Shane\\"). Credit must also go to Paul Dano (\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\"), who does an admirable job of holding his own against the greatest character actor on earth. In a recent TV interview, Dano said that Day-Lewis never once broke character, even refusing to acknowledge him off-camera.    This marks the most cohesive and mature work from director Anderson, who adapted his screenplay from Upton Sinclair's novel \\"Oil!\\". Anderson's previous films have shown a tendency to polarize critics and audiences. I personally find him one of the most unique American filmmakers working today, and I think that this movie is going to surprise a lot of people. Kudos as well for Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood's soundtrack.

B00005NTJK|5.0|Amazingly mature at their third album, Jethro Tull released Benefit, a bluesy/folksy rock album that still stands the test of time.  For someone like me, you like the very old Tull, their blues rock phase was a fantastic period in their career.  The album in whatever form is phenomenal, but it's now been digitally remastered, with 4 bonus tracks added, making for a perfect album in every way.    As for the songs themselves they all stand up equally well, in my opinion, but favorites are \\"with you there to help me\\", \\"for Michael Collins, Jeffrey and me\\", \\"to cry you a song\\", and from the bonus tracks my favs are \\"witch's promise\\" and \\"teacher\\".

I found some areas of the film had a white flicker effect, something I would expect from a VHS tape.    3. The case for the DVD's, built like it was meant to never have the discs removed.  The circular tab that holds the discs, holds the disc too tight, you actually have to bend the discs to remove them.

B0013FBS20|5.0|A lot of the negative reviews have pointed out that it's a terrible adaptation of the book by Richard Matheson, but I simply have to say that it's a standalone movie that takes the plot outline from the book and puts its own spin on things. On its own this film is a very emotional, intense, and at times quite a frightening movie that will have you thinking that this is possibly Will Smiths best performance to date.<br /><br />A cure for cancer is created from a genetically modified disease, but this cure turns into an infection of its own and soon spreads across the world killing most of the worlds population and turning the rest into mutated vampires which have fed on those last few survivors. Robert Neville is a former Army Lieutenant Colonel/Scientist who is forced to have his family taken away from him whilst he stays in the quarantined New York City looking for a cure to the mutated virus. His daughter hands him her dog, Sam before they take off in a helicopter. 3 years down the line and the human population of New York and possibly the world have died out and Robert is possibly the only human survivor. As he still battles to find a cure we are given an insight into how Robert copes with possibly being the only surviving human on Earth. He sets up mannequins in stores, pretends like their real people and interacts with them as if they were actually living. The Dog Sam is his only companion in the movie and we come to appreciate and love the relationship that develops between Robert and his Dog. One scene in particular that shows the intense emotion that this film reaches from time to time, is when Robert is cradling Sam in his arms after Sam is attacked by mutated dogs. Due to open wounds Sam is infected with the virus and Robert is forced to kill Sam. This, to me is a very upsetting scene and personally had me on the verge of tears, this shows the pure acting skill of Will Smith and proved to the critics that he was perfect for the role. The mutants in the film for the times that we see them are very intimidating and the chase scenes are quite intense and place you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Will Smith has always been one of those actors that a lot of people would doubt until they saw him in a movie or playing any particular role. I have to admit I had my doubts about him playing the last man on Earth and had my reservations about a film like this altogether as you would have to be prepared to sit through a movie with just the one human character on screen for the larger portion of the film and I had my reservations as to how this would play out altogether. Once putting the movie on, my doubts were simply put to rest as from the first scene Will Smith enraptures you in intrigue as you're shown how the man is hunting down his food in the form of a deer. The action sequences are intense and all scenes featuring the mutants are unbelievably frightening, even more than I thought they would be.<br /><br />This is a genuinely great movie and on Blu-Ray it's made much better with the alternate version parallel to the original cinematic version. This is a gem of a movie that I think all Will Smith fans will adore and even if you're not a fan of his previous work, this will make you want to see more.e times that we see them are very intimidating and the chase scenes are quite intense and place you on the edge of your seat.

B00005JPLW|3.0|Historically, 300 is all about the last stand of Spartan King Leonidas and his personal bodyguard of 300 soldiers as they protect the strategic pass of Thermopylae--the only mainland entry into Greece from the viewpoint of the Persian Empire--from an invading force of Persians under Xerxes I. Visually and artistically, 300 is second-to-none and beautifies the art of killing and of war, at least to the extent that it looks like eye-candy. Ideologically and culturally, however, 300 can be construed as both a metaphor of today's War on Terror and a celebration or at least study of conservative, traditional values of nationalism, discipline and principled idealism. Despite all this potential, a great deal of 300 is actually factually inaccurate, campy, absurd and melodramatic.<br /><br />300's a film that has many pros for its many cons. To prioritize, I'll start with the most clear-cut: its aesthetic value as it relates to what you see. The main selling point of attraction is not the story, the gore, the actors, the graphic novel-based material, the killing, etc.. Above all else, it's the visual treat that 300 is from start to finish. This movie redefines the concept of aesthetics by being psychologically enjoyable to take in. Unless you're blind, it will keep your eyeballs glued to the TV screen with each increasing shot of bedazzlement. Whether it's the slow-motion scenes of slaughter or combat  (beheadings, hailstorms of incoming arrows, spear thrusts); the rendering of the stark, coastal terrain near which the battle takes place; or the costume design of the Greeks and Persians--300 is the epitome of visual beauty on film.<br /><br />Some scenes that are simply breathtaking on the right HDTV-and-DVD-combo are:<br /><br />-The young, Spartan boy shown battling a 3-D rendered wolf<br />-The first clash between the 300 and the oncoming Persians<br />-The hailstorm of arrows fired by the Persians with the 300 ducking beneath their shields<br />-Leonidas fighting and then killing the Giant<br />-A young, Spartan warrior successfully launching a spear which cripples and kills a charging, rhino-like monster from the Persian side<br />-The Persian elephants pushed off a cliff by the Greeks<br /><br />The point I was making is it's a very pretty film; did you get that? Good, because that smoothly segues into my next, complimentary argument: 300 is a film that has to be viewed on an HDTV of some, considerable size (42 inches and up) and power (true HD like 1080p). With this single-minded emphasis on style, you're hurting yourself if you don't watch it on a TV which has the specs to exploit the visual *rgy that 300 is.<br /><br />To that end, I tell anyone who'll listen that 300 could've excluded ALL the pithy and corny dialogue and just focused on showing scene after scene after scene of slaughter and fighting...and been a better film because of it. The fighting scenes are all that matter in 300 due to their graphical wizardry, and the sometimes dumb-as-a-doorknob dialogue really lowers the pleasure of 300 in some parts!!!!<br /><br />For instance, the \\"writing\\" (if you can call it that!) of the dialogue is so awkward that it's unintentionally hilarious. The dilemma with the dialogue is it's questionably broken up into boisterous monologues after each battle sequence or plot development, like a Shakespearean play. I.e., after the Spartans build a \\"Wall of the Persian Dead\\" during a lull in the fight, Xerxes I and Leonidas \\"exchange\\" dialogue, but it comes across more like the stilted and swollen delivery of self-righteous actors, who cannot act, in some crappy, off-Broadway theater-show. Similarly, after Leonidas and his men have been vanquished, the movie ends with the one-eyed Aristodemus leading the charge of a crack-squad of newly allied Greeks; the \\"speech\\" he gives to motivate his men is absurdly contrived like the BS one would expect in WWE wrasslin!!!!<br /><br />The flaws worsen as the exorbitant quantity of historical violations becomes UNFORGIVABLE!!!! These idiot, revisionist films from lib Hollywood are always mismanaged if they draw from historical material; it's become a fun game for me to watch these films just so I can count and then expose each, historical inaccuracy in their films. I don't have the 700 or so pages I require to list the historical flaws in 300, so I'll just give a small sampling of what I discovered:<br /><br />1.  The number of Greeks defending Thermopylae was actually 2300: the 300 Spartans but also 700 Thespian volunteers, 400 Thebans and 900 Helots!!!!<br />2.  300 shows the Greek soldiers (called Hoplites, by the way [sidenote: there's a sophisticated and all-around awesome reviewer haunting Amazon by the name of The Hoplite Phalanx Fighting Formation; you're EXTREMELY lucky if you get a shot at reading his reviews]) fighting OUT OF their Phalanx Formation! This is sacrilege as they would've lost the battle had this occurred! Educated viewers know that the only reason Leonidas had so much success against Persia was precisely due to this Phalanx Formation which slaughtered Persians in this narrow space!!!!<br />3.  Leonidas' Spartans would've fought using the Macedonian Sarissa, the long pike 300 clumsily shows the Greeks using. However, many fr*udulent scenes show the Greeks impotently fighting using poles that are MUCH shorter than the average, 17 foot length of such a weapon!!!!<br />4.  There were absolutely ZERO elephants used at Thermopylae; the dumba*s makers of 300 egregiously confused Thermopylae with the Carthaginian trait of using elephants in some of their battles.<br />5.  Xerxes I DID NOT, historical records will validate me, under any circumstances look like a San Francisco-styled, cross-dressing, transgendered S&M practitioner, who looked like he would be marching in a g*y pride parade!!!! Records show that Xerxes I would've actually sported a beard, braids and robes.<br /><br />Another wrongdoing that's so faulty is how 300 panders to an immature, testosterone-infested, teen-male audience; it does this in part by exploiting unknown actress Lena Headey. Let me tell you, my social-conservative sensitivities were totally ransacked here. At about the 20-minute mark or so, Headey is shown topless, simulating sex with Gerard Butler. She's either such a shallow woman or depravedly finds it an \\"honor\\" to flash her bre*sts that one shot flagrantly just shows her bre*sts kind of flapping in slow-motion!!!! This was so blatantly pandering to the teen audience of males, who probably popped collective chubbies while watching this the first time!!!! I say that Headey could've used major bre*st-implant surgery as she failed to be attractive enough on the merits of her chest alone. In fact, I award her Nero Demerits and rate her a 3 for her SAGGING efforts!!!!<br /><br />I sprung for the two-disc version, which got me the \\"bonus\\" disc with behind-the-scenes features--because I like to be taken for a ride by the studios' cheap misconception of what constitutes worthwhile, \\"bonus\\" items. One of the features has the censurable Frank Miller impudently defending his historical revisionism and corruption of the Battle of Thermopylae!!!! For instance, throughout his little feature, Miller relentlessly admits to not accurately representing the facts surrounding Thermopylae or even Spartan culture, yet he downplays it as his right to do because he's allegedly just an \\"artist\\" \\"re-imagining\\" something historical...BS! I castigate Miller and all those who'd defend his corruption of history because if he was using source material for his 300 graphic novel, then he had a duty to reliably reproduce historical facts, or else come across as an intellectually lazy and sloppy revisionist...which he is.<br /><br />300's biggest, redeeming quality is in its ideology, where there are parallels for our western way of life in the present. The Battle of Thermopylae symbolizes today's War on Terror. Back then, Greek conservatives (Spartans) stood up for the principle of freedom and the preservation of the western way of life in the face of the eastern expansionism and aggressive instigation by the Persians. Today, American conservatives (GOP) are mostly leading the charge to defend the principle of freedom and the American way of life in the face of the radical Muslim expansionism that also is the instigator!!!! And this despite the stubbornly perverse, Democrat effort to thwart tough, anti-terror measures...kind of like the film's Ephors and the Spartan governing council, both of whom resist Leonidas' insistence on self-defense. Whoa--the parallels are just breathtaking!adey. Let me tell you, my social-conservative sensitivities were totally ransacked here.

B00104QSOM|3.0|I went out and bought this film  on 2-disc DVD over all the<br />hoopla at the Oscars over it, and I must say that it just<br />left me feeling like it was \\"Just, Okay\\"!!--That's all!<br />Daniel Day-Lewis does get deep into his roles and is totally believable<br />in his role as the ruthless, scheming, maniacal lead character!<br />The boy who plays his adopted son is great too.<br />But there is much inconsistency and uneveness in the story-telling.<br />The so-called rivalry between Daniel Day-Lewis's character and<br />the bible-thumping young religious zealot boy who stands up<br />to him is not illustrated well..(only a few uneven scenes here<br />and there, which makes me think that some of the better<br />scenes are on the cutting room floor!)<br />Don't get me wrong, there are some great moments too!<br />But in the big scheme...Ehhh, not so much!<br />I agree with one of the reviewers who said that the second disc<br />sucks as far as special features go!
B000002V1D|5.0|The Wedding Album is undeniably one of their best albums. A comeback it is, and a whole new fresh sound for a new decade. I enjoyed the fact they brought in some new styles but still kept to some of their original roots. An all grown-up Duran Duran compared to their work in the 80's. I find it fits into the 90's quite nicely.       Everything on this album is memorable and truly classic. \\"Ordinary World\\" and \\"Come Undone,\\" soft ballads from the heart that are just unforgettable. It's easy to see how these songs became so popular and remain enjoyable after all these years. And I still find \\"Ordinary Wrold\\" their best ballad to date. \\"Too much information\\" \\"UMF\\" and \\"Drowning Man\\" are your fix of rock, and they're not to disappoint. Others \\"Love Voodoo\\" \\"To whom it may concern\\" \\"None of the above\\" and \\"Sin of the City\\" also great songs.  The only song that I disliked was \\"Shotgun,\\" it didn't stand out like the others and it didn't make much sense to me.     5-star rating, ranks right up there with Rio and Astronaut, a masterpiece all of its own. I highly recommend this album and you won't be disappointed. Fun till the end!    I also recommend you buy the single \\"Come Undone\\" for the bonus track \\"Stop Dead.\\" I wish it had been on the original line-up. If you like this album, you will, and I mean, you will like it!!!!
B000286RNY|4.0|Even though this movie reminds me a little of the old Sunday afternoon \\"Kung Fu Theater\\" B movies, the antics are histerical, and the special effects are really good. The movie even has a pretty good plot and message about overcoming obstacles and striving to rise above one's circumstances. I happen to be a soccer fan, and rented it on a whim knowing it was a comedy. Once I had watched it, I knew that I had to own it. My kids and I watch it three or four times a year.

B000ULQV0W|1.0|A one, and a two, and a one-two-three: \\"There's a beeeeeeeg/ a beeeeeeg, hard sun/beeeeeeateeeeeng on the beeeeeeeg people/in the beeeeeeeg, hard world...aaaaaahhhhhhhh, just SHADDUP already, will you Vedder!?!?<br /><br />The aforementioned, lame*ss song that's been overplayed on Top 40 radio stations is of course from the Into the Wild soundtrack, which in turn is based on the doubtful movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the pro-hippie, liberal, anti-establishment, anti-capitalism puff piece of a book by former part-time fisherman, Jon Krakauer. If you presume that Edward Louis Severson III (so much cooler sounding than Eddie Vedder, incidentally) is a demi-god--musically, anyway, (which automatically means you have a tendency to be a liberal, a socialist, a Marxist, a progressive)--you'll be surprised to know that the \\"biggest\\" track off Into the Wild is actually a lame*ss cover of the ultra-obscure band, Indio, song \\"Hard Sun\\" from 1989's Big Harvest. That really divulges how TALENTLESS and UNIMAGINATIVE, just to scratch the surface, Edward Louis Severson III is!!!! He was tasked with piloting the soundtrack to the same-named movie, and pathetically, his most known \\"contribution\\" is just ripping off a song from an unpopular album from 89, probably ignorantly scheming that most people wouldn't know...but I know!<br /><br />The movie of this soundtrack is the recent, mega-flop of a catastrophe directed by none other than notoriously anti-American, enemy-emboldening traitor-actor, Sean Penn, who in his spare time visits Iran and Venezuela to corruptly author pro-totalitarian puff pieces disguised as articles which run in the waaaay liberal San Francisco Chronicle! I properly sentenced the movie of the same name as the mega-flop of a catastrophe it is because it anemically made only $18 million domestically; if you know even a pittance about domestic grosses, this is easily as bad as the mentally ill Tom Green movies of jack*ss-tyle comedy. Nah, what the hell am I even writing, for goodness sakes? Tom Green movies are easily superior at the box-office and elsewhere compared to the Sean Penn-directed celebration of vagabonds and hippies that Into the Wild is!!!! The implicating fact that the movie of the same name failed to out-gross even scatological Tom Green films is a total verification of how conservatives who argue that Hollywood should make more family-themed movies are 100% correct. Ergo, Into the Wild was an R-rated piece of sm*t.<br /><br />The overarching theme of Into the Wild was essentially being a hippie: becoming an environMENTAList, becoming anti-capitalist, supporting the oxymoron called \\"social justice,\\" becoming anti-establishment, and returning to nature to, I suppose, find yourself and maybe commit suicide due to malnutrition and a miscalculated plan about living in Alaska. Since this is the movie's soundtrack, all of Edward Louis Severson III's songs echo and even hawkishly promote this same kind of ultra-idealistic, but ultimately unrealistic, outlook on life.<br /><br />Just take Edward Louis Severson III's piracy of the enormously obscure band's, Indio, song, Hard Sun. All the lyrics are about aggressively hawking a frame of mind of feeble, Democrat-voting VICTIMHOOD, aka VICTIMOLOGY. I believe the official definition of victimhood in Webster's Dictionary is what Dems tell their prospective voters in heinous acts of mass-pandering to make them dependent on the Dem Party. But back to the Hard Sun lyrics. Just read the BS in them:<br /><br />There's a big<br />a big hard sun<br />beaten on the big people<br />in the big hard world<br /><br />The translation of these is that the world is so cruel and everyday, normal people are just so worthless and incapable of surviving by their lonesome...without nanny state, Democrat intervention, that is.<br /><br />Or how about the lyrics to another Edward Louis Severson III-penned BS, Far Behind. Here, Edward Louis Severson III (man, his real name just rolls right off the tongue and is a lot easier to say than Vedder, isn't it? I at least think so!) actually has got the impudence to pretend to be disillusioned with and then even cynical about wealth! This, from the same Edward Louis Severson III whose band, Pearl Jam (j*zz), sold something like a zillion records since 1991! Read these lyrics:<br /><br />Empty pockets will<br />allow a greater sense of wealth<br /><br />First off, damn Edward Louis Severson III for penning an oxymoron--how the hell exactly do empty pockets make one feel wealthier???? Is he practicing voodoo economics, fuzzy math, or something?!?! Oh, wait; I now know what his ploy is! He's, however ineptly, trying to talk in riddles so that no sane person gets him. However, his Vedder-holics (fans who will worship him despite his mediocrity) will presumptuously attribute all kinds of \\"deeper\\" meanings to what's essentially gibberish of the highest order.<br /><br />How about Edward Louis Severson III's further BS-penned drivel, Society? Here, a twisted and unhealthy thought pattern that gives a distressing look into his mind is uncovered. Read the lyrics:<br /><br />If less is more<br />how you keepin' score?<br /><br />Wow, profundity, thy name is Edward Louis Severson III!!!! Witness how \\"expertly\\" he was able to rhyme \\"more\\" with--get this--score!\\" All he did was play on an overused clich&eacute;, and there you have it: more idiotic and profundity-deprived lyrics which will, sad to say, get all the Vedder-holics into tizzies of assumption, presuming that Vedder's somehow conveying something \\"philosophical\\" or what have you. Further, do you \\"bright\\" Vedder-holics all see the flagrant thought pattern in his elementary school-style lyrics? He's obviously racked with hypocritical, liberal guilt about how much money he has because he--like Hillary and Obama--knows exactly how this makes him unable to relate to all the \\"little people\\" he's always BSing that he wants to help!<br /><br />Edward Louis Severson III is also a barbarically insufficient musician; this is incriminatingly demonstrated in the fact that despite him playing all instruments on Into the Wild, they all, however, sound like they were played by monstrously inexperienced, freshman, high-school kids, who were just messing around in their parents' garages with instruments they neither knew how to play or ever saw before!!!!<br /><br />One thing that absolutely galls me with Pearl Jam (j*zz) fans is they obstinately still insist that Edward Louis Severson III is an awesome singer and musician who's still relevant...BS! Nothing could be further from the truth, yet the sycophant, probably liberal Vedder-holics obstinately refuse to listen to this proper criticism. Geez, and they say GW Bush never listens, sheesh! Anyone with intellectual honesty knows that Edward Louis Severson III's pipes have been irreparably dilapidated since 2000's Binaural. That is to say that he hasn't been able to sing at a peak level since any of Pearl Jam's (j*zz's) albums of the nineties. If you compare anything from the nineties (Ten, Vs., Vitalogy, No Code, Yield) to how Edward Louis Severson III sings on Into the Wild, you'll notice an unpardonable difference. Whereas he used to sing like a raging lion in the nineties, now, Edward Louis Severson III sings like a deflated, asthma-suffering old man who doesn't have the lung strength to belt it out anymore. I also demand that the Vedder-holics realize that Edward Louis Severson III is probably a closet Republican living in the suburbs due to his enormous wealth; there's nothing progressive or liberal about a preppy millionaire living in Seattle and flying lear jets around the world!!!!<br /><br />I want to end this so-far, award-winning review for Into the Wild's soundtrack by rhetorically asking:<br /><br />So, Vedder, how's that Vote for Change Tour from 04 working out? Did you manage to get John \\"Flip-Flop\\" Kerry elected? How's that kick GW Bush out of office thang going???? How's that traitorous effort to reign in the Patriot Act coming? How's the Dem effort to \\"end\\" the war going?? Are the troops finally out of Iraq prematurely????<br /><br />MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

B0013D8LOU|5.0|Awsome movies, I dont usually like musicals (which are very few on film), but I loved this. Singing is great, music even better, nice and dark, with characters who fit their roles just right. Almost makes me want to see a broadway play. Tim Burton is a genius, I always love his movies.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|I have read some of the other reviews concerning this version and I must say that I agree with some of them almost exactly. The casting was good, the settings were great, the main points of the book were covered but the final scenes drug the possible great film downwards.    *POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD* Perhaps the most romantic scene in the entire book is when Captain Wentworth overhears Anne speaking with Harville about men versus women forgetting their loves. Wentworth writes her a beautiful letter while surrounded by people, then goes back into the room after leaving to make sure Anne knows it is there and hers. The scene is dramatic in the sense Frederick finally expresses his feelings while in addition there is the fear of Wentworth being discovered writing a letter to Anne. In this film version, the audience has no idea where the letter is written or what exactly provoked him to write it. It was almost as if the production crew filmed everything else and realized, \\"Oh yeah, we forgot the letter...let's paste that in somehow.\\" I also read elsewhere someone asking why Anne would be running about Bath the way she did. It seemed very out of character for Anne Elliot to be running all around looking for Wentworth.    This film was better than some of the newest BBC adaptations of Jane Austen, however as far as \\"Persuasion\\" goes, the 1995 film is the best one out there. This can easily be used as a compliment to the book and the 1995 film version but standing alone it's not all it should have been.

0440238609|1.0|If there's any doubt that Pullman's infamously anti-God, anti-Christian and anti-religious trilogy, His Dark Materials, is anything but, allow me to clue you, the reader, in on the exact genesis of the title of the trilogy alone. His Dark Materials is a somewhat veiled reference to the 17th-century, English poet John Milton's poem, Paradise Lost. In fact, this sacrilegious poem is the basis for Pullman's trilogy. As a refresher course, let me educate the reader into recalling that Paradise Lost is actually a poem in which the main protagonist is Satan himself who, from a modern perspective, is certainly presented as a sympathetic being who merely has the ambition to challenge God. This absolutely runs counter to the vast majority of Christians who view Satan as the Enemy of Man and the epitome of anti-life!!!! If that's not enough to make the case that His Dark Materials is hazardously atheist...then NOTHING will!!!!<br /><br />His Dark Materials is indisputably an absolute, unmitigated assault on religion and Christianity specifically, and what makes it all the worse is its insidious plan to primarily target children via indoctrination through its kiddie lit!!!! Adults can willfully decide for themselves whether to be God-fearing or instead choose the path of spiritual sorrow through atheism or even agnosticism, yet impressionable kiddies don't have the mental ripeness to make this decision themselves--especially if they're being indoctrinated into hating God and organized religion, as His Dark Materials does throughout.<br /><br />What makes His Dark Materials so lethal--and this trilogy is DARK indeed (as in anti-life and infernal)--is that it trespasses far beyond criticizing organized religion. It actually advocates DEICIDE of the Judeo-Christian God as described, in one of many examples, in a passage from The Amber Spyglass, which describes the encounter between protagonists Will and Lyra and the dying Authority (Pullman's catch-phrase for God)!!!! The passage reads \\"...there was nothing to stop the wind from damaging him, and to their dismay his form began to loosen and dissolve.\\" Further, \\"...he'd vanished completely...Then he was gone: a mystery dissolving in mystery.\\" There, anti-Christ Pullman fondly expresses his longing wish that God is destroyed forevermore.<br /><br />I wish that this lustful embrace of DEICIDE was the height of Pullman's atheist and liberal breaches, but, alas, that's only the tip of the iceberg. In further, mortifying example, in The Subtle Knife, there's the character of Mary Malone, a physicist who used to be a nun. She says of her experience: \\"...till I saw there wasn't any God at all and that physics was more interesting anyway. The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" Little, impressionable children--due to the reprehensible carelessness of their ignorant or amoral parents--continue to endure these anti-Christian messages throughout Pullman's trilogy!!!! Note that there isn't even a pretense of balance attached to Pullman's anti-religion bigotry--he doesn't even attack Islam, for instance.<br /><br />The whole premise of the trilogy is anti-Christian at its inception because the evil, institutional force in the books is termed the \\"Magisterium\\" which Catholics should be familiar with as the teaching body of the Catholic Church. Pullman's association of an evil, oppressive institution with the Catholic Church should be enough to start alarm bells ringing at once.<br /><br />In the Golden Compass, the \\"Dust\\" business, the plot-driver, is divulged, and it's a source of conflict between the villains (read: the Church!) and the \\"good guys\\" (read: enlightened, atheist scientists!). The Church views the Dust as the root of original sin and, therefore, kidnaps children in order to perform \\"cruel\\" experiments on them designed to sever the child's soul--in Pullman's world, appropriately called a \\"demon.\\" The severing of a child's soul turns the child into a zombie, yet Pullman accuses the Church of wanting to do this because of his prejudiced belief that religion turns people into thoughtless zombies.<br /><br />The anti-Christ themes only get more raging with the Subtle Knife (ironically, the worsening anti-Christian bigotry is anything BUT subtle!). In this novel, we discover that the aforementioned Dust is actually a code word for a bunch of rebel angels (read: Satan and fallen angels!) whose motive is vengeance. The witches in this tome believe that Lyra (a little girl), is destined to be the \\"second Eve,\\" a new mother of all through her disobedience (read: disobedience to God, or the \\"Authority\\" in Pullman's trilogy). These same witches learn that a certain \\"Lord Asriel\\"--the trilogy's liberal role model due to his embrace of science over religion--is planning a war against God, again, another metaphor concerning Satan who is eternally at war with God.<br /><br />The final installment, the Amber Spyglass, is so anti-Christ that if you're Christian, you'll be chilled with its blatancy!!!! The second main character (a little boy named Will) is being watched over by two rebel angels who are also HOMOSEXUALS--Will is moved by their man-love for each other--who encourage Will to bring his god-destroying knife to Asriel, who wants to kill the Authority (read: God).

B000LXH11C|4.0|Following his own peculiar career path, Alan Parsons became an unlikely star by recording a series of conceptual albums featuring a wide variety of singers and musicians, making rich and complicated music that still managed to cruise onto radio and beak the Top 40. Be they topically based on literature ([[ASIN:B000OFP8O4 Tales of Mystery and Imagination]], [[ASIN:B000002VC5 I Robot]]), art ([[ASIN:B000026C1Q Gaudi]]) relationships with the opposite sex ([[ASIN:B000026D42 Eve]], God and mysticism ([[ASIN:B000IOM1YG Pyramid]]) or our own foibles ([[ASIN:B000IOM1YQ Stereotomy]] and [[ASIN:B000IOM1Z0 Turn of a Friendly Card]]), he managed to create sonic tapestries that few others could match.<br /><br />This album switches a few tracks from [[ASIN:B000006X6R The Definitive Collection]], mainly adding the \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" suite. Dropping \\"Pyramania\\" shorts the \\"Pyramid\\" album, and offers a few different picks from \\"I Robot.\\"<br /><br />Parsons and his creative partner in the APP, Eric Woolfson managed a nifty trick though out their heyday, which was to create complex music and make it sound simple. There were no ELP gymnastics here, no Yes-like side long odes to alternate universes, and no musical condescension that often plagued prog-rock collectives. Just memorable hooks attached to beautifully structured ballads (\\"Time, \\"Days Are Numbers\\") pop (the Phil Spector style \\"Don't Answer Me,\\" \\"Eye In The Sky\\") and Album rockers (\\"Stereotomy,\\" \\"Dr Tarr and Professor Feather\\"). He also had a knack for immaculate instrumentals, some became almost as well known as the hit singles. \\"Sirius\\" in particular became a heavily used Sports theme.<br /><br />Listening to these songs (remastered and sounding amazing) is a reminder of just how beautiful high-fidelity can be in the age of computerized compression and MP3's. Don't get me wrong; I love my I-pod. But in the race to replace fidelity with convenience, artists with a style like the Alan Parsons Project or the equally idiosyncratic [[ASIN:B000G73U5Y Steely Dan]] find their music less likely to be heard in the manner it is created. And that's a shame. Get this CD now (and others like it, like Parson's work on [[ASIN:B00008CLOA Dark Side of the Moon]]) before the CD meets in inevitable doom.<br /><br />The remastered albums of Tales, Robot and EitS are all worth picking up.

0385302320|5.0|I bought this for my wife. This is her third time through the series. She decided that it is easier to buy them than to continue to check them out at the local library, as she intends to read the series several more times. It must be really good.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Almost Famous is a fantastic (and true!) tale of a young kid who ends up writing for Rolling Stone magazine.  Borrowing from different parts of his real life, writer/director Cameron Crowe introduces us to William, an extremely gifted teenager who ends up touring with a band named Stillwater.  William misses a half dozen deadlines, gets caught in the middle of band politics, and falls in love with the \\"band aid\\" Penny Lane.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite films of all time.  I was afraid that the director's cut would screw up a great narrative, but the scenes that were removed were cut simply for time.  They flesh out the band members more, and give you even more insight into what an outsider William is.<br />Even better, the commentary track includes the voice of Cameron Crowe and his mom.  Letting his mother join the commentary proves to be both daring and insightful, as she corrects some of the slight differences between the film and real life.<br />Other extras on the disc aren't quite as special... but the director's cut does include a disc of \\"Stillwater\\" songs, written by Cameron and his wife, Nancy Wilson.<br /><br />This disc takes one of the best films of all time and makes it better.  Well worth the purchase.<br /><br />-John
B0015KO52S|5.0|After seeing The Raconteurs live in Dallas, Texas back in the summer of 2006, one thought ran through my mind:  \\"These guys are much better live than they are on the album.\\"  Don't get me wrong; I really liked Broken Boy Soldiers.  But the band really came alive in concert - the energy levels were higher; the music was sharper; the melodies clearer; and the experience was just more fun.  If only they could translate that live experience to the studio...    With Consolers of the Lonely, the guys have done just that.  From start to finish, the album exhibits a higher energy, sharper (often ferocious) tunes, and excellent melodies.  Even an initial listen reveals that the guys had more fun recording their sophomore album than perhaps their debut.  If you thought Broken Boy Soldiers was more co-singer Brendan Benson's show (not only in vocal duties, but all around feel), be warned - this album is The Jack White Show.  Of course, singing duties are, for the most part, evenly divided between the two frontmen.  But where Brendan brought out the pop sensibilities of his counterpart on Broken Boy Soldiers, Jack brings out the RAWK from his partner.  And the results are astounding.    My heart will always lie with blues-rock of The White Stripes, but with Consolers of the Lonely, The Raconteurs prove that they can produce a fun album that rocks just as much as the Stripes and, at the same time, sings as well as any Brendan Benson solo albums.      The Raconteurs return to Dallas in two weeks.  I'll be there.  You should, too.
B0013ND30W|4.0|History repeats itself!  \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was the first animated Disney film to be released on VHS tape (*many* moons ago), so it makes perfect sense that it would be their first animated film to be released on Blu-Ray.   I can hardly wait!   I have always loved the distinctive artwork (kudos to the late-great Eyvind Earle) and the villianess that is Maleficent (voiced by the same actress as the Evil Stepmother in \\"Cinderella\\").   And knowing that it was originally made in wide screen format, it will certainly be a feast for the eyes on Blu-Ray!

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I loved this DVD!!! But, it made me really sad because the series is gone!! After it was over, I wanted to see more!!It was great to see the unusual suspects, but I have to confess I missed Colonol O'Neill, I wish they could have at least had him do a cameo appearance. It was nice to wrap up the Ori story line, we were all left hanging abit with the last televised episode.  But, they left a little mystery behind, because we still had to wonder if they were really finished!!! This is a DVD that all fans of the series must own!!
0393327655|5.0|I am a huge Sam Harris fan and I really hope everyone will give this book a chance, despite any personal thoughts you have on whether or not God is real. This book is a fascinating examination of why religion is so prevalent in our world and why it seems to be a growing force in modern day politics. Also, I found the most interesting aspect of the book is not it's concern with religious fundamentalists but rather, the high number or religious moderates that essentially allow fundamentalists to say and do whatever they want under the protection of their \\"faith\\". Sam Harris is a great writer and keeps the book moving and definitely will make you question what you think about religion and your own beliefs!
0307383415|5.0|Unlike most of the negative reviewers, I don't think you have to share Barack Obama's politics to like this book.  This book is not a typical political memoir in which the author is the nearly flawless hero.  Instead, Obama presents himself as a messed-up kid who became slightly less messed up over time.  His father and grandfather were incapable of sticking with relationships, and for nearly all of his life his father was absent.  I get the impression that his mother and grandparents were not quite strong enough to fill him with reverence.<br /><br />He mentions the infamous Rev. Wright once or twice, but does not really discuss Wright's paranoid politics; perhaps he was unaware of Wright's craziness when he first wrote this book, or perhaps Wright was simply a little less crazy.  What attracted him to Wright's church (at least according to this book) was the church's good works and his ability to bring the black lower classes and middle and upper classes together, much as Obama sought to do in his organizing work.<br /><br />Do I think more or less of Obama as a potential president after reading this book?  A little of both.  He comes across as a bit unfocused, a bit too obsessed with his blackness, but kind of thoughtful too.  I'm not sure he's tough enough, but I don't think he's a fervent radical or a fervent anything.  If he does win the White House and fail in office, he will fail as an indecisive wimp rather than as a dime-store Trotsky.

However, now after listening to it about 40 times I decided to look it up to try and find more music like it.  I listen to it just to relax and am a new fan of orchestrated music (coming from the likes of hard rock).  Also, I get emotional and have even teared up (Spectres in the Fog).  My description of the composition entailed here is it is a breath of fresh air while it moves and motivates you or relaxes the mind.  Funny since that is what the movie pretty much entails.

0743277708|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite books.  5 stars.    I had to read this book for a humanities literature course.  Having never heard of it before, I was a little skeptical when I found out that the characters were rabbits.  However, the professor promised us that we would enjoy the book once it got going.  It was one of his personal favorites.      Once I got through the first 50 pages or so, I couldn't put it down.  I was reading any chance I had to see where the adventure was going next.  The rabbits' epic journey makes for a great story that's easy to get into.  I'm sure that I will read this one again sometime in the future.

We must be desperate for a quick answer or just unintelligent enough to succumb to the dumbed-down version of the paradigm shift of science and spirituality. We all knew what this book has said already. Thoughts do have a profound effect on your psyche, ect. Wow. We must have forgotten. Okay, well, time for application, hmmmm?

006135323X|4.0|Only a professor of behavioral economics would conclude that when people respond to motives other than money they are being predictably irrational. If you want to see some clever experiments that demonstrate that people are interested in things other than money, read this book.<br /><br />I would like to observe, however, that such experiments have to be taken with a grain of salt when people know that they are experiments or reflect unexpected questions rather than serious looks at on-going behavior in areas where people have a lot of experience. For instance, the book looks at whether and at what price Duke students will sell basketball tickets they have just put a lot of effort into getting.  Clearly, there are factors other than profit that motivated the buying in the first place. Most students probably wanted to get lucky and go to the game.  Selling a ticket under these circumstances denies the opportunity to go to the game.  A ticket broker would make a rational decision about whether to hire students to try get a ticket this way, but a student who does this a few times wouldn't.  Study the ticket broker and you'll get more economic behavior. Study the student who wants to go the game and you won't. So why should we be surprised?<br /><br />I remember being a subject of a lot of these experiments as a student. If the experiment struck me as particularly stupid, I would often feel rebellious and do things to act in noneconomic ways just to prove I was a person. I didn't see that effects like those are being studied here.<br /><br />If you want to learn about human behavior, I suggest you study all of the motives . . . not just try to understand the economic motives.<br /><br />In addition, some of the experiments probably depend in part on the common meaning of certain words being different than the definition that a professor would use. I think the experiments about certainty and probability wording may be tainted by that problem.<br /><br />Professor Ariely is a clever fellow, but I think he stretches his conclusions further than they deserve. He's also interested in finding ways to make people look stupid rather than appreciating the genius that most people exhibit routinely. I couldn't help feeling that there was too much economic motive in his desire to write this book (a P.T. Barnum approach rather than trying to truly educate).etches his conclusions further than they deserve.

Where's the idiot who wants to turn down that invitation? Kahney's style lures you in and holds you, locked on his verbal click wheel; his riveting material is delivered in a subtle, satirical frame.

B00005JPXY|4.0|Some people will harshly criticize this film for its extreme use of a home-video camera.  I will admit that I was nausiated while watching this film... However, I was also emotionally involved and vulnerable to what was happening on screen.  Unlike some negative reviewers, I actually stayed to watch the whole film and was shocked by the delivery as a total package.  I am a long time horror fan... I like extreme and terrible films... This film was able to make me jump and I don't get that very often.  So, for that, I give it 4 stars.  This movie set out to do something original for once and for those that try to over analyze the film... What is realistic about a monster destroying Manhattan anyway?  Before you start to examine the probability of other aspects... try answering that question.      --In closing, I firmly believe those affected more severely by motion sickness will have a much easier time watching this one at home.  The visual effects and pounding audio mix will combine to eventually be remembered.

1416955070|3.0|Overall it had nice story line and was okay. However certain parts could have used a little more time on and there were some writing errors that were hard to overlook in that they made a statement confusing. Plus, the whole brother sister subplot was well disappointing. Not to mention it came off rather forced and didn't seem to sit with who the characters were. It was as if the writer thought it would be a great twist and rather pushed for it instead of letting the story progress naturally. It was different than others, which gives it a nice try for effort but in the end it was just too convoluted. There were just too many layers of it that was just simply dumped on the reader all at once in a rather desperate attempt to make it fit when it didn't. There weren't any hints throughout the book to give an idea that something might be off or that there was more to that subplot than met the eye. It just didn't work is all. Not that it couldn't have been pulled, but it just wasn't. It's almost as if the author made a split second decision at that part in the book in order to create a conflict that just didn't set right not simply for the taboo of it but because of the way it came off as having just been dropped in it at the last minute. It didn't flow with the rest of the book and caused mine (and probably other readers, too) to loose their focus with the story, making it easy to reject. It just wasn't made believable. It was an extra push for conflict that simply wasn't necessary since that relationship already faced certain problems to begin with. There wasn't even any wiggle room left to change it later in another book. That whole area was basically told to the reader with very little flair and no actual excitement.      The climax of the story was just so-so. Like the author couldn't find a way to give reader's a good continuance ending so this \\"gruel\\" was slopped on a plate and was tried to be force feed down a reader's throat. I'm almost reluctant to even readthe next book. Granted other reviewers claimed not to have been able to get very far in this book, I did finish it. Admittedly, it is a slightly off towards the beginning chapters but it does get better until the ending occurs then it's just sad in the roll your eyes and shake your head sense.
0452289963|1.0|Not only does he steal liberally from Buddhism, he pilfers Christian ideas too, such as those of Oswald Chambers and even the ancient Catholic mystics.  It doesn't bother me that he is repackaging old ideas, but it does bother me that he misinterprets them to prove his weaker points.  He constantly quotes Jesus out of context, which is enough to turn me off.<br /><br />Also, I think it's interesting that his strict adherents tend to criticize everyone who dislikes his message by insulting their intelligence.  Truth is simple.  You can dress it up, you can complicate and obfuscate it all you want, but underneath all that, the truth is what it is, and I promise you it doesn't take a 180 IQ to discern it.  But this sense of superiority, to me, proves that this philosophy does not fly, because if it did it would engender love and humility among converts, not a pissing contest.<br /><br />Last thought, if you are looking for meaning, try 'The Ragamuffin Gospel' by Brennan Manning, it really hit home for me.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold has truly mastered metal with their beautifully brutal \\"City of Evil.\\"    This is quite possibly the best album recorded in the past 20 years. It has everything: Mind-melting guitar solos, powerful singing, heavy riffs and curse words being screamed at high tempo. Somehow, Avenged Sevenfold brilliantly put all of these together in 8 minute long masterpieces that flow from bridge to bridge, solo to solo with relentless intensity and drive.    Guitar. Lots of electric guitar. With overdrive. Playing really fast. Then some acoustic. And a full orchestra. Then a solo with the orchestra. And another solo with the acoustic guitar. This album doesn't stop. It's genius. It's melodic. It's heavy. From the first full-out scream by the vocalist to the final blues solo played over a sad, echoing melody, \\"City of Evil\\" shows all of us what true metal, no, what true music should be like, and utterly destroys any preconditions \\"Waking the Fallen\\" may have instilled.    If there were a just and loving God, this album would have gone multi-platinum in its first week. Buy \\"City of Evil.\\" RIGHT NOW.
0765318741|5.0|Following my usual preference for reading before viewing, I looked up Richard Matheson's book after one of my Amazon friends reviewed it. Though not a big vampire fan, I was completely absorbed in this classic story.<br /><br />Robert Neville is apparently the only survivor of a plague that turned the rest of mankind into vampires. Barricaded in his house by night, he roams during the day when the creatures hide from the light. Anger, alcohol and the horrors he's seen threaten to push him into madness but he channels his energy into searching for the science behind the phenomenon. The story--a short novel--keeps its relentless pace and tension right through to the jarring conclusion.<br /><br />There's always a challenge in keeping the \\"voice\\" all the way through a story with essentially one character and not much dialog. Matheson meets that challenge. Neville goes through the fire of his solitary horror-ridden years and comes out rusty-voiced but not without hope. At the end, a tipping point, a synthesis--too late for Neville to ponder it, but it will stay with the reader for a long time.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2008

0226039331|4.0|It is the best lexicon of the Early Christian Literature (NT included) available, because its entries are characterized by excellent classification of the meanings, because it gives sound grammatical-syntactical information of the words, it gives plenty of examples with proposed renderings of specific passages, it discusses difficult cases, it refers briefly to the origin of the Early Christian Literature words and it adequately presents  their contemporary extra-Biblical usage. Something else very important is the rich and updated bibliography that is provided.<br /><br />In other words, it is a great improvement and expansion of the Grimm-Thayer lexical tradition, but, comparing to Grimm-Thayer, it gives lesser attention to the LXX usage and the Hebraic background of the NT words. Allow me to consider this an imperfection of the BDAG that forces the reader to buy also a LXX lexicon or a theological one (such as the TDNT abridged or the EDNT) in order to have a more spherical view of NT Greek, but I have to admit that nothing vital is missing. The second drawback is the price. Finally, a couple of times I have noticed mistakes in the etymology; but, of course, this is not an etymological dictionary, neither does it claim to be one.
