B0033UWSYK|4|Easy to put on, and serves the purpose unless your baby is like mine and manages to discover the corners not totally covered.  But it's less area that I need to clean off, so it's working great!  Love the little pocket for toy storage.
B003VS1V0G|5|This Pooh is the only one with which my twins go to sleep!! that's why I had to buy 2 for each, to have time to wash them!!
B004DC9TBM|5|Totally worth the higher cost. This will be our only stroller, so we were willing to splurge. I am not able to jog with my infant yet because of his age, but we're already impressed with the ease of set up and use. I've read other reports about user height vs. handle height. I'm only 5' (2.5' at the hips) and its perfect for me.
B006Z6E9I2|3|I love this product, I really do. It's easy to clean, and it makes a lot of food at once. The product description says it can go in the dishwasher but don't put the main bowl in, it will crack and cause issues. If you have a receipt, the company will send you replacement parts.
B0002PR43O|5|This is the best thing ever.  I looked at several exersaucers and did a lot of research.  My 6 month old needs a lot to keep her occupied and this one is great.  I don't know what we would do with out it and I would recommend this to anyone.  It is well worth the money and it was cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else that I looked.
B005A3OGRA|5|My baby was exclusively breast fed until 6 months and her pediatrician suggested starting her on water from a sippy cup once we tried solid foods. She never took to drinking from a bottle but she does enjoy this sippy cup. It is spill proof and the soft spout is perfect for her to &#34;gum&#34; on.
B00LRSXTTS|5|Beautiful!!
B008POOY8M|5|This was a gift for my nephew,  9 months old, everyone from mother to son love the peter rabbit set!
B001PTGPTK|3|I bought this seat for my son, who we started potty training when he was two.  Because he's a little on the bigger side (like I said he's 2, but wears a 4T) we decided it was best to potty train using the toilet and a seat.  When we got the Lightning McQueen seat home we were excited since it seemed to ease our son into the whole potty training experience; however, once we started using it we realized that although it was cute it was not functional.  The duck on the front that helps prevent \\"over-spill\\" is nowhere near high enough and is basically useless.  Also, we find that the handles get in the way of him sitting on the seat...this might be because of the way that he sits.  Again, the design is cute and the removable cushion is nice for cleaning; but the duck is not designed very well.
B008DI0H7W|1|My husband and I ordered four pieces of unfinished Little Colorado furniture, including the Arts and Crafts Table and Chair Set, from Amazon and three Amazon merchants and decided to return everything due to the poor, unacceptable quality of the first two pieces of furniture we opened. The packaging of all four boxes arrived in good condition; however, boards were splitting and splintering on both the Treasure Chest and the Kid's Bookcase The bottom of the Treasure Chest was made from manufactured board, which was also splitting; and the holes were misaligned in the Kid's Bookcase. The returns made through Amazon and Wayfair were truly hassle free; however, we had some difficulty processing the returns through aBaby and LearnRight Toys - but in the end, everything was refunded to us.
B000K53UEI|5|Love this drying rack! Very useful stay right next to my sink and easy accessible for cleaning and making bottles!
B00VKLY0FO|5|Shipped quickly, they where what I was expecting.
B006U9DCNC|5|I'm not embarrassed to say I'm pumping while writing this review.  That's how much I love these larger shields! I am able to pump more milk and more importantly, more comfortably now.  If you're on the fence debating if they're necessary, the answer is yes.
B007PDHL5M|5|These burp cloths are soft, cute and they deal with the drool with no problems.  I received my first set as a gift and loved them so much, I bought more!
B004IYNIFS|4|Ordered this stroller a month ago after a lot of research and we are very happy with it.  We broke it in with a week of walking around the Disney parks and taking 3 flights across the country.  Our 15 month old, 23lb son seems to find it comfortable.  Here are a few +/-s:<br /><br />Positives:<br /> - We never kick the back - I am 5'5, husband is 5'9 and my mom is 5'11<br /> - Cushy seating pad that comes off quickly for washing or drying out<br /> - Can definitely push it with one hand easily, I pushed it through the airport with one hand and had a rolling suitcase in the other and it was no problem<br /> - Can fold and unfold it while holding the baby and lift it with one hand<br /> - Sun shade is awesome - can pull it over to shade the baby with the sun at almost any angle<br /> - Stands independantly and hasn't fallen over yet<br /> - Really good recline<br /> - Looks good and construction is solid<br /><br />Negatives:<br /> - Doesn't fold up completely flat - the bottom wheels stick out quite a bit<br /> - The foot rest needs to be adjusted every time you use the stroller.<br /> - Basket is a little awkward to get things into because there are some hanging straps in the way<br /><br />Overall the positives definitely outweigh the negatives in my opinion and we are really happy with our purchase.  We also bought the Uppababy travel bag and it fits well in there and rolls up pretty small and fits into the basket.  Would definitely recommend this stroller.
B001TFHVVG|2|These are so small - only a few pieces of popcorn (handful?) fit into a container. Would not recommend. .
B000EMNF3I|1|Have used Bumkins bibs in the past and liked them.  My complaint is with the descripton of THIS bib.<br />It was described as a bib with ties and it is velcro.  Not happy.
B004CLYZ0O|5|QUICK SHIPPING, PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED!
B000E0P2E0|4|I am so excited about this stroller.  This is my first review and as the mother of twin 16 week old daughters I am pressed for time.  But my initial review of this stroller is excitement!  I received a couple used strollers that were not compatible with little babies.  So I went on the hunt for something better.  I have the Graco Snugride car seats and was excited to find an affordable stroller that would take the seats (I found frames for the seats for about 10 dollars less than I paid for this stroller).  I AM FREE!  It is difficult to go anywhere alone with them.  I live in a beautiful college campus neighborhood and it is spring.  Now I can walk, and shop alone.  The car seats fit perfectly.  I read the review that said the car seat sticks in the rear seat, and it does.  But you can reach underneath the car seat easily and press the hook back  manually and it will pop loose.  The cup holder is not deep enough, but I tossed my water in the basket underneath against my big ole diaper bag and I could reach right in for it.  It is super manageable for me by myself, but I am not a small woman.  It folds up very easily also.  I agree with the review I read that it probably would not fit in a car trunk, unless it's a big car!  But I have a mini van so I went for it and it is perfect.  I gave it four stars because I have pushed much nicer strollers that felt more solid, but they are hundreds of dollars instead of a hundred dollars.  And twins on our one income, we are pinching the pennies.  So for the money, I feel this stroller is spot on.  We haven't had it long, but for what I need it for, it'll be just fine!  If you read this, thanks for your time!  Hope it helps!  Cheers!
B002AMPYSO|5|got this for my wife on valentines day and she loves it!  its alot bigger than i thought it would be.  lots of pockets and zippers
B008MGZCKW|4|I like the toy box a lot. The pictures are very bright and the sides are glossy. its perfect to match the accessories in my son's mickey bedroom. It's a lot smaller than i thought. When I was trying to put it together, (the 2 middle round rods) the screw were striped out.I could not get them to go in at all. the other pieces went together easy. The instructions have no words, its just a bunch of pictures. Other than those few problems this toy box is awesome.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just wanted to do a little bit of an update. I wanted to say that the more I walk by the toy bin, the more I love it. Its colors are very vibrant, and the toys fit in very nicely! Besides for a couple of striped screws, This little bin was awesome. I think the more I see it, the more I love it!! It's the perfect size for a little kid!
B00KO984JG|5|LOVE THIS UMBRELLA  Great Product!
B00AE12NIW|1|I am very disappointed. This is a deceiving post! I thought I was ordering three leg warmers but it just came with one. And I didn't get to pick the pattern. I'm not impressed with the quality either.
B00354UNSM|5|I am mother of three. With my first two I used the modela manual breast pump and hated the tugging of it, luckily I hardly ever had to pump. It was also a pain to clean. I've used the Simplisse now for about a month and can't say a bad thing about it! My let down is pretty intense tho so the \\"no tug\\" of this works for me- yes it takes slightly longer than other pumps but worth it to me. It's very soft too! And a \\"pain to clean\\"?? Not at all! So much easier than the last manual pump I owned! I love this thing, wish I'd found it with my first baby and not my last!
B001PF9XUM|1|The medicine dropper is terrible! Once you flip to check the correct measurement the medicine starts dropping. Very bad!
B00FGRPDV8|4|Good for 1 month and under. Nice colors. Expected I'd get more wear. Worked well after hair washing. Worth the money
B001WAJVZM|4|works well, if the kids would leave it alone. they keep removing it to play with it.
B008J3UD4S|5|This definitely adds extra protection and folds up easily.
B0000CCOJM|5|My daughter is 3 1/2 months old and we finally decided to put this together and let her play in it.  We got it as a shower gift and it has been stored away until the time was right to get it out.  She was starting to get bored in her bouncer and she has never really warmed up to her swing, so we let her play in it and she LOVED it!  She didn't really need the extra support with a towel like I thought she might because she's already supporting herself.  She likes the lion, the spinning bubble, and the 1-2-3 animal with spinning parts.  I would definetly recommend this item to amuse and stimulate your child.  My husband and I see something new she's learned from it almost everyday.
B0009XBX4K|5|I ordered these to supplement my breastmilk storage capacity. A regular Medela nipple fits onto the top of the storage containers. These 2.5 ounce containers are great for storing smaller amounts of breastmilk to feed to your newborn, or if you are just breaking it down into smaller amounts for storage. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to store breastmilk.<br /><br />For those in the U.S.A., these are considered eligible medical products by the IRS that can be purchased or reimbursed from a medical flex spending account.
B000MPNMDA|5|I had been looking at all of the different shopping cart covers available and came upon this one DISNEY!!  Perfect for us it has all of the details I was looking for and works with shopping carts and most high chairs at restaurants is easy to use, safe, and fun, with the additional benifit of being disney too. I love this product. As a foster parent I am really careful before I buy anything knowing it is going to get a lot of use. So far so good. I would definately recomend this product.
B000056HMX|5|Very strong, easy to use, and effective.
B001J2DOG0|1|There are 2 already placed adhesive squares on the guard that matched up exactly where the wall plate's two scews were, making it unsturdy and wobbly since the screws were not flush with the wall plate.
B0016RVM4O|5|All the naturepedic items are great.  The pad is waterproof and it is soft and doesn't smell like anything.  I love it.
B00J3YWJBW|5|Baby roues is the carriage to buy. Beautifully crafted, outwardly appealing, smooth ride and the most OUTSTANDING customer service I have ever encountered. I had some issues and before I knew it had a replacement delivered to my door. The best.
B003U6HCGQ|5|a mi bebé lo entretiene mucho,el precio muy bueno, el envio super aficiente.  Ademas de que es facil de quitar y poner en todas las cosas del bebé, en el car seat, en el stroller y la cuna !!
B000GE1MEI|3|When I first got this, I loved it. My 1 year old son has recently discovered the toilet and this was a great way to prevent him from getting into it.<br /><br />Well, everything was great until I noticed that my son has figured out how to &#34;unlock&#34; the toilet. For most parents, this product would be a dream, but for me, currently the only thing keeping my son out of the toilet is whether or not he wants to fiddle the lid-lok to unlock it.
B00000ITJ4|4|i think i like this more than noah but he enjoyed in the beginning.  i think he became a little bored with it before i expected.  but, all in all, great toy for playing 'in and out' and exploring 'glass' bowl.  my only complaint is that my set, which was ordered online, did not have the crab which, again it is just me, i really missed because i have an affection for crabs and lobsters (don't ask!).  i would recommend it as a good toy and one that you don't have to be worried if they fall on it or in any way harm themselves while playing.  it shouldn't hurt to have fun!
B002J9HKOE|3|We purchased this mattress elsewhere last year while I was pregnant...Fast forward our baby girl is now 9 months (~21 lbs).  She's been using the mattress since about she was ~4 months (12 lbs).  Pros:  - The mattress looks comfortable.  - She sleeps well in her crib while on the mattress.  Cons:  - No literature came with the mattress, so...It's left up to the buyer to determine which side is for the infant and which side is for the toddler.  There are two different designs on either side that may assist in determining which side is infant/toddler.)  - What are the weight limits for the infant and toddler sides? This information was not received with the mattress.  - The mattress sags on both sides.     The sagging was noticed right away and as another reviewer mentioned we began placing her in different areas on the mattress (for some silly reason, I thought she was already sleeping in one spot too long).  Due to the mattress sagging our daughter has been sleeping on the toddler side since about 5 months of age.  Yes, there is still sagging on the toddler side, a little less but it's still obvious.  Again, since she sleeps well it's not an issue now, buy it's very likely we may have to buy another mattress by the time she's a toddler.
B008KCR7W4|5|After owning 5 car seats over the years, this is by far the best carrier I've owned. It is so quick ad easy to install the base. And the carrier removes from base with ease, unlike my previous carriers. And I love the fact you can adjust the recline on the seat.
B00OH4RRSS|5|I recently purchased this exersaucer after many failed attempts to entertain my 4-month old son with other items (i.e. swing, play mat, etc.) The first time we put him in this he didn't really know what to make of it, but it got the nag of it quickly. After only a few days he just loves being in the exersaucer. Each time he moves to different play station he gets excited like he is discovering for the first time. It is also nice to be able to put him in here and know that he will be safe and not rolling around on the hardwood floors.<br /><br />Cons: there is only one con for me so far. My son was able to pull off the mirror stand...twice. He is pretty strong and I guess he wanted to get a closer look at himself...LOL! Its not too big of a deal because the pieces are not sharp and it doesn't look like he could hurt himself.
B0075CIFVM|4|Loved it ! Super cute !
B00003TL7P|2|I purchased the Diaper Champ for the same reason that most people do... no need to use special garbage bags.  However, I was extremely disappointed in how difficult it is to get the top open to change the bags.  I break a fingernail every time I have to do it!!  Also, my daughter is only 3 months old and her diapers aren't even bad yet; unfortunately, after just a day of changing diapers (and making sure the diaper tags are secure), the darn thing is already difficult to flip.  I'm sure it is great about keeping the odor down, but I have to change the bag every 2 days anyway because it is clogged up.  I do not recommend it at all.
B00PU9PQ46|5|This is my 3rd carrier, and my favorite carrier so far. I have a ergo carrier, and infantno carrier. This carrier is the most comfortable carrier among all , my 8 months old boy love sitting inthis thing forward facing. Happy kid happy mommy.
B002TOKHGC|5|we got these when our baby was just around 2 months old and she liked them.  we took them on vacation, use them for changing table distraction, etc.  only thing is they can (we're told) develop mold so you have to dry them well and replace.  but worth it-- we've bought more than once and totally worth $ to have fun bath time.
B003N49ML8|1|Had this cup for less than 2 weeks - on the 3rd time it was used I noticed my son gagging on something.  He eventually coughed it up and it turned out to be half of the straw from this cup!!!  HELLO toddlers have teeth!!!  This cup is ridiculous, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see lawsuits coming up for this in the near future!
B000UXS9LY|1|This is the worst! I think my husband was able to get our baby in it once or twice, but it looked ridiculous on him. He ordered the largest size and it still only came down half way down his chest. Nowhere near his stomach where a normal sling would rest. Luckily my daughter can probably use it with her American Girl doll. Go with an Ergobaby!
B007SIZR8M|5|I bought this to go with the similac bottle. It is perfect for travel and to leave when Grandma and Grandpa are babysitting. This way they don't have to measure anything and the bottle is ready to go. I fill the bottle up with the correct amount of water, put the powder cap on and that way all they have to do is pour the powder in and mix it. It is also great to pack for church, when we go out to dinner or run to the store and might need to do one feeding while we are gone. I am able to use the 4oz bottle filled with water and put the powder cap on and pack it in my purse. I am going to buy more of these. They fit the 4oz and 8oz bottles and don't make the bottle too much bigger then it would be with the original cap (which this new one replaces). It washes up well and is easy to clean (comes apart in two pieces so you can easy clean the inside).
B005NJH4QG|2|Too strong for babies.  Our grandson was too numb and was very unhappy!
B0007OD8SU|5|I stressed about which monitor to get and finally chose this one. Its been great, no interference in our neighborhood, and the battery stays charged for a decent amount of time.
B004353F7S|5|Adorable gift bag.  I used for a baby shower for a baby boy.  Delightful.
B002DWALTI|4|My baby really enjoys the wind up toy on this mat but he ends up pulling it off. He gets upset when the music stops which happens pretty quick.
B000BNQC58|5|My son uses this every night.  It stays on for about an hour then shuts off.  The light turns orange, blue or green.  You get to pick which is nice since my son loves green.
B0016L0MMS|5|This design is smart.. fits on every toilet and also as standalone... the liners are nice, but shopping bags could do the trick as well if you are in a bind!
B00CF7EDLI|3|They are a cute style but I never got to use it. I ordered two of these, one for me and one as a gift. They never stated in the description that they only had large left, so that is what I received when I got my order and I needed smalls. One of the packages had been opened before be cause It came to me majorly taped up again.  I had to return these items because an exchange was not an option. But return was free and I got my refund prompt.
B00DNF2P34|4|perfect size !! lid closed tight so i can just drop the entire jar into hot water to warm it before serving.  and Glass, so i don't have to worry about BPA.
B000YDDF6O|5|I am a piano teacher, so I like my granddaughter to hear music. This has a lot of classical pieces, so I hope she will get to like classical music as she grows up.
B00PRMMHRK|5|Fits Volvo S60 perfectly! Great product!
B00AFBM4H6|3|Could fit 3 sippie cups in it to take to daycare and thats it. Very tiny, but it worked well until the zipper broke after about 2 months.
B009TB4ZMK|5|I had a moby wrap with my first son and it worked... Ok. I hated that it took a few minutes to put on when baby was crying to get it on nice and secure.<br />The Gemini is sooo much easier! Takes about 10 seconds to put on and have baby snugly inside once you get the hang of it. It is comfortable and doesn't hurt my back. Baby loves it! I wear him all around the house and everywhere we go. It holds baby properly: sitting on the butt and thighs and not by the crotch, excellent head support, and baby leans against your body without his chin-to-chest. I love that is adjusts appropriately for newborns without a separate insert.<br />I love the pattern also. Very pretty!
B00AM5NTIS|3|Well, I'm using them for the second time today. My daughter complained that it made a mess in her lunchbox the first time I sent one, because the lid thing came off. But I like the concept of them, they're a good size, and I like the idea of using them instead of something disposable.
B005A3OGR0|5|Helped my son move from a bottle to a toddler sippy cup!
B0043D28B4|5|This is a great starter book for infants who are 1-3 months old...they seem to like the noise it makes as you turn the pages..excellent idea
B00CA918R8|5|Cute and useful
B005G37X4M|5|Convenient and cute. It is nice to have on the carrier.  It matches the diaper bag well too.  I love it.
B004044LD4|5|We purchased this mattress to fit into a Jenny Lind crib.  It fits perfectly--no gaps at all between the mattress and the crib frame.  The mattress did not have any kind of chemical smell to it when we opened the package.  Our daughter has been sleeping on it with no problems at all!  Also, our regular crib sheets from Target fit very tightly on the mattress.
B0053MLQF8|5|So cute! It has held up sooo well.
B0081P7RJ8|5|love these cute door stops. Easy to put on or take off at Grandma's house. Can also teach colors at same time.
B002R80AOO|4|It worked great for me and my baby. I highly recommend it. It is super easy to keep the baby clean.
B00C5HT7ZU|5|Gifted and was a big hit with the kiddo!
B0033WRT9W|3|The pacifiers are fine, and would have rated this product higher, but as it says \\"colors may vary,\\" and we received very pink, clearly-intended-for-girls pacifiers.  I was hoping that since \\"colors may vary\\" and you can't choose your color, that they would be more gender neutral.  Thankfully we have a very secure 4-month old boy ;) haha
B00005JIVI|1|I used the safer bather a few times and thought it was very useful.  Then it started to smell!!! I washed it three times and could not get the smell out. Also, I noticed a rash on my daughter's back and arms around the same time of the smell.  I threw out the safer bather and used the sling from her newborn tub and shower combo (on this website). It works much better and it is easy to clean.
B001FCM24E|5|Great stroller it was perfect for my infant i paid 55 for a floor model.  It is great convenience small and easy to pull out i had no problem my daughter had from birth to 11 months but car seat got too small fit any one. i had even flo. I would get a bigger infant carrier so i could use the stroller longer if i had another child but very stury sit car seat well and good on wheels.
B000GB1ZDE|4|these things work great... glad I decided to buy them.
B0058CT68M|5|love it
B00E5LYF8S|5|I love this bag. It's cute, contains plenty of storage, and manages to keep everything compressed into place.
B00OVSBQB4|5|Haven't used it yet, but easy to install car seat and stroller is great and easy to maneuver.
B004YGL65E|5|It's hard to think of ordering something like this online, because I never do... but I took the chance.  The first crib arrived in less time than they had said, but it arrived in broken and splintered pieces...but I contacted Amazon, and they immediately shipped another one, in only a few days. It was a no hassel event!  The second one arrived in perfect condition.  The crib is more than the pictures showed...it is sturdy, elegant, and a fine piece of furniture.  I'm particular about the belongings in my home...and this crib is just beautiful in every way! It's just so nice when you can purchase something that you can afford...and have it look like you paid at least twice as much for it.  This is definately a winner that you couldn't possibly be disappointed in!  And Amazon...thanks!
B005Q09S7A|5|I have other works of Francis Hook and her soft coloring and emotional portrayal of Jesus is wonderful.<br />I have already framed and hung it in my home especially for my Grandchildren to appreciate.
B00005YVRM|1|We bought this walker for our son when he was 10 months old. It's terrible and I am surprised that Fisher-Price would market such a dangerous toy! It's too heavy in the front and tips easily. If you use it on a hard floor, it moves way too fast for a beginner walker. My son tried to walk with it and fell flat on his face! The wheel popped off a couple of times. And the space between the two legs is too narrow and my son kept getting his feet caught in the legs!         The only saving grace to this terrible toy is the fact that my son likes to press the nose to hear the music!        VERY DISAPPOINTING!        Kathy - mom to 2 yr old
B000XSCCUU|1|I currently own the Day/Night Video monitor from summer infant.  Decided to try this product due to another addition to the family, but this monitor is horrible!  It has a very bad picture and sound quality.  The split screen images are also very small.  Do not recommend this product.
B0040Z2HY8|5|Bought this for my daughter.  This will really help her when she needs to feed the baby.  Amazon made it easy to order and receive.
B004IYNIQC|5|I don't have a baby but I just read an article [...] and it shows a picture of Reese Witherspoon with her baby and this stroller.
B001CDWVO2|3|We bought this dresser/changing table because we also bought the matching crib which we love, this item is good but not great. We've been using it for 7 months now and I will say that the unit itself is sturdy and I have no concerns about putting my daughter on it to change a diaper. Where I'm starting to be concerned is with the quality of the drawers and the sliders they operate on. Sometimes you have to jiggle the drawer a bit to get it to close and I feel like if you forced it you could break it. We weren't looking for furniture my daughter would have for life and it remains to be seen if we'll use this for baby #2.
B000H1IYXW|4|Great innovation - has brought a lot of stress relief as it works and stops our kid from falling off the bead as he does move and turn a lot.
B000R7L80C|5|for the first time used it yday! they stayed on well, nice and clean for my 1yr old to pick puffs from.. removed it without any issues.
B00065H55W|4|I use this pump everyday.. It's great for moms on the go who still want this child to be well nourished.
B008UV8R8I|5|Love it ! It was Great Purchase and Great Quality, Good Deal Overall. Definitely happy with this Purchase. Met My Expectations
B00CBKZVFG|5|I had to return the competitor's version of this so it got this one instead since I could remove all the fabric to wash it. This is a very important to me when deciding on a product. I loved the other one & recommended it to everyone, but now I can say I like this one even better! It is a little more slender so it's easier to fit between the wall & bed. It allows my baby to stretch his legs out. He is 6 mo, btw, & still fits in this. It's very sturdy. The grippers on the bottom stick to the floor good. It has a vibrator & removable cushion. It folds up for easy storage & travel! Love it!
B00HERU26O|5|These are a fantastic addition to our Super Undies.  They add a significant amount of absorbency without significantly affecting the bulk (or the comfort) of the Super Undies.  We have had no leaks using the internal soaker folded in half and adding one of these.  Will definitely get a few more.
B00NFETGMQ|5|Best bassinet for a newborn.
B005CNEQK0|5|We reciently traveled half way across the country. We travel with a Britax Marathon 70 and before buying this always had to carry the carseat which was such a pain. We latched the carseat on to this cart and but a carry on duffle bag into the seat of the carseat. We could wheel it forward or backward with no problem. We also had our son in the carseat at one point and wheeled him around in it. Works great wish we would have bought it sooner. With the carseat on it didnt fit down the airplane isles butit was worth it to have it in the airports.
B000HAWCJK|4|The colors and style of this bag are beautiful.<br /><br />That said, the fabric is not practical-this silk type brocade is prone to snagging very easily.  Also, it would be nice if the straps were a tiny bit longer.<br /><br />However, the pockets, etc. are spacious, and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it from friends and strangers alike.<br /><br />Bottom line, it looks really cool but you are sacrificing practicality a little bit on the snagging issue...my recommendation is on the fence for this product.
B002USE0Q0|5|You can't beat these blankets, and the price was just right. For a summer or winter baby, if you swaddle or breastfeed in public, these are ideal. They breathe, but help baby maintain a healthy body temperature.
B005EDW15A|5|This is a great organizer for kids.  Love it.  It has a lot of room.  Fits the car seats well.  I got 2 of these organizers.
B000CNOIQ2|3|They are ok, only warms the first couple wipes on the top, other than that is good
B002UXQRES|5|Great
B00793SDIW|4|love these sippy cups...  it's a great idea...  just wish the travel lids worked better... my son likes these cups the best...
B008QUQ4MO|5|This handy organizer helped me get all the kid stuff in the back seat under control.  The size is perfect to fit between the 2 convertible car seats in the 3rd row in our minivan.  I considered the larger size but was happy I got this one because this needed to fit between 2 car seats.<br /><br />The kids in each seat on either side can now easily reach the books or other toys they'd like to look at while we're on the road.  The 2 cup holders in the front are a great extra spot to hold extra snack cups or water bottles while kids are moving around - although they can't reach them while they are strapped in their car seats.
B00CHN6WJ6|5|Remember when the nasal aspirators used to have this lonnnng snout? Always made me afraid to use it on my child. This aspirator is smaller, softer and shorter than the old style----I don't have any problems using on my grandson! It is a tiny little thing but does a really big job. Great for newborns and a very useful gift.
B000YDDF6O|3|Good little toy for baby. Bright colors and good sound. The tunes are classical which is fantastic and not annoying. My son enjoys it but only for a few minutes.
B007DFS00M|5|Good size for little hands, well made, very cute and looks just like the mouse in the movie - our 3 year old loves it.
B004GJXNHI|5|I bought the Zooper Twist stroller last year and I love it a lot! It has all the features that I need in the stroller. It lay flat and has big canopy, and lightweight for a stroller that have a lot of feature. My baby who is 23 months love to ride on this stroller too.
B004H36ZZA|5|They are very soft.
B003AJHDQW|5|I use these for a burbling cloth and a general purpose cloth around baby. They are absorbent and wash well.
B0080D5A2M|2|Don't waste your money!  This is more like a sway than a swing.  The toy bar adds more weight which makes it sway slower...good thing it's detachable.  It is nice that it has a vibrating option so it's a two in one kinda thing.  It's cute.  The music is a good feature as well.  It just doesn't swing.  It's more than likely on it's way back to the store.<br /><br />Spring for a regular size swing.  It takes up more room in your house but is a very valuable tool for a baby...and Mommy (if you want to clean your house).
B000096M59|4|I could almost copy my review of the straw cups by the same brand!  They do leak through the drinking holes, but not badly.  My daughter set one upside down and I didn't notice it for 10 minutes.  There was really only a small wet spot on the rug despite the cup being half full.  We have some fancier sippy cups with leak valves, etc, which don't leak at all but I find it annoying to wash the extra pieces (we don't have a dishwasher) so I use these more.<br />Also, the same as my straw cups, the lid does not screw on so can come loose.  I have NEVER had it completely pop off, even being tossed over the side of her high chair.  It can come lose partway, then pop off completely if it keeps being dropped.  I just make sure the lid is still on tightly and have not had a problem.
B004S2AM2C|5|I received a little set of Green Eats dishware at my baby shower and these spoons are THE BEST. I tried those soft tipped spoons from Gerber, but they don't hold any food. These spoons have the perfect depth and capacity for feeding little mouths. I thought they seemed hard and rigid, but nope, my toothless little guy is happy to chew and suck food off these spoons. I was so glad to see these on amazon, thought I'd have to go to Whole Foods or some granola baby boutique. Yay for these spoons. The green eats snack bowls are great too!
B0007ICPO4|3|The directions call for 1/4 cup and I found it was too much, as I mixed powder came up the sides and it never reached that firm of a consistency. My daughters print looks very messy but I didn't try to get it perfect cause she's 1 and hates the feel of anything sticky on her hands.
B005PK1CCU|1|The problem everyone is having is that this fan is wired backwards, and this causes the blades to spin in reverse blowing no air.  You can reverse the battery polarity the the fan works fine, but you have the use a tin foil shim in the battery compartment to get the battery to touch the metal tabs hidden behind the plastic.  When the fan spins the correct way, it works fine, but obviously another stellar product from the far east.  I would guess China.  I might switch the cables at the magnet to run the batteries in correct polarity, but i am out of solder.  Will be returning when i get the chance, but will use it for now because it is 100 here and i need something until i find a replacement.  Very poor product.
B00EDMZ114|5|There's nothing like Softbums. I hate the look of rise snaps and being between snap sizes. With these diapers I get a perfect fit even on brand new littles AND no more ugly snaps! So cute and so soft. I use these as an AI2 and can get multiple uses it off one shell, plus, no PUL against baby's skin and with the bamboo inserts they're super absorbent AND super trim. I'm in love, I want ALL the Softbums!
B003KMWATY|5|We love Dr. Browns bottles and have used them with all 4 of our kids.  I like that they are BPA free now.
B004OBZLX2|5|Great for cruises.
B00B4JKJDO|5|My son loves it!! I just washed it for the first time, and it didn't fade or anything. Still looks excellent. I use it over my sons big blanket at nighttime, and he loves that it is so soft.
B00KY3XQ3G|5|like
B00ESPJH7A|5|This is one of those products that's so simple yet effective, you wonder why there aren't more like it. In a world of clunky, over-the-top plastic baby products that take over your home, the One-n-Done is refreshingly small and- dare I say?- elegant. Maybe a plain plastic bucket isn't your idea of elegance, but if perfect functionality is, then you'll agree.<br /><br />I rarely think about the diaper disposal process because it is both annoyance and odor free. We wrap up a full bag every day or day and a half, and ::presto!:: the new bag is there. No forgetting to replace it until the next time you have your hands full of dirty diaper.<br /><br />The hanging functionality is great, and manages to both be large enough for any changing table ledge, and avoid jiggling on one that is smaller than it's full capacity.<br /><br />Plus, look at the price!!<br /><br />If your sense of aesthetic gravitates toward seamless functionality rather than designer posh and polish, this is the diaper pail for you.
B000W1M2EY|5|The little hole is the perfect size for your finger. My baby loves to suck on this pacifier, and it's been a godsend in getting him back to sleep after midnight breastfeedings when he still wants to suck but is no longer drawing any milk. We brought one home from the hospital, and I'm about to buy a bunch more. Don't pay attention to people who say they are choking hazards; if the pacifier is small enough that the entire thing fits into your child's mouth, it is too small for him. Buy a bigger size!
B00INF1O5Y|5|Super quick shipping! These towels are soft and perfect for my 17month old. They washed very well too.
B0011MQLNQ|1|It was wobbly and very unstable. Not at all what I would expect from Fisher price. Very disappointed! Expected so much more!! Do
B001QVG9YS|2|I bought these bottles for my twins, thinking they would be great for us since I plan to breastfeed them, but also have to go back to work. The babies latch onto them fine, but they take forever to eat from them! With twins I needed something fast, since I have to do everything twice. I often use bottles during the night so I can get back to bed sooner, but I have been using plain old bottles because they drink so much faster from them. My other complaint is that they do leak a lot. Breastmilk is liquid gold, and who wants to waste it!
B0010XVH08|1|We ordered the camel color and when we received it the color of the item seemed off compared to the picture and the product registration card had the wrong model listed. We contacted ErgoBaby about the product registration and they suspected the item was counterfeit.<br /><br />They had us take pictures of the stitching patterns, and it turns out that the item we ordered (Camel color) was counterfeit. ErgoBaby is a great company and is replacing our counterfeit item at no cost to us, but buyers of this item should beware the swindle.
B008J1QP56|5|My 8 month old loves this puppy!  It is so soft and well constructed!  Very cute and worth every penny
B004W2R8KM|5|I got the aacua towel as a baby shower gift for my first baby, and I loved it!! I even bought another one for my second baby as well. As a new mom you are still learning to bath your active baby, and this towel made the bath time really enjoyable and much easier. First of all, the towel protects your clothes from getting wet when you bath your baby, second, the towel is right where you need it when you pick up your slippery baby from the tub and dry him up, and third, when my son was a little older he loved to run around in it wearing it as a bath robe. The great quality and soft, plush material are a plus. Well worth the money!
B00DB5ITSG|4|Beautiful set but I got the crib sheet with the bubbles not the cute ocean themed sheet as shown.
B003UERREA|1|I soooooo wanted to love this bag. I reçeived it as a shower present. But it is a big deception. First, it s too small even for one baby, and it easily looks very bulky when it s full. Second, after only 4 months, the handle started to tear apart and the bottom corners were showing excessive wear and tear, not normal for the price you pay! I know own a kipling alanna baby bag and i am soooo happy. Seriously, I don't understand the popularity of the BFF bag.
B0035ER4WU|5|The fun colors interest my 10-month old, and are just the right size for him to learn how to hold a cup.
B000JWSO9I|4|My son really likes this toy, although he hasn't really started teething yet.  My only complaint is that it ATTRACTS dirt, lint, and hair.  We have a dog, so dog hair sometimes gets on things, but my son doesn't even have to drop this for it to get covered.  We only use it at home because I have to rinse/wash it every 5 minutes.
B0012H8XCC|4|works as needed. kind of expensive for what it is
B009MHXU0O|5|very comfortable and cozy on cold nights.  good quality product
B003UGZAZ6|5|I will say up front there is a little learning curve with a ring sling, but once you got it, it is so wonderful and comfortable.  You can try to seek out a baby wearing group in your area if you need help.  It should feel completely comfortable and weightless.  If it doesn't and chances are it won't your first try, you are probably just missing something.  Hang in there.  The rewards are great.  I find it is very important to make sure it is straight, and not folded in any way.  Also, bend your baby back and reach between his/her crotch to pull a generous piece of fabric to have between you and baby upon insertion.  This will create a great, secure seat for your little one.  I find higher up is better.  Remember, you should be able to kiss them.<br /><br />I loved wearing my baby in a forward carrier (Boba) and as she became older, I wanted her to be able to look ahead and behind so I chose the ring sling.  I still wear her.  She is 18 months and 24 lbs.  I switch sides from time to time to even out the weight distribution and to equally stimulate her body.  I can wear her for long periods of time.  The fabric is also lovely, and I haven't had a problem in the summer.  A few things that are limiting about a ring sling in my opinion (which doesn't detract from it but just sometimes makes another carrier a better choice for a particular task) is you don't have full use of both of your arms.  While you are mostly arms free, one arm is frequently around your baby which is just natural as the baby is perched on your hip.  If you need to carry something, you are going to have one hand and limited use of your second hand and you can press it against your baby for a little more support.  If you need to sign something and the baby is on the side of your body with which you write, it will be very difficult.  I have found impossible.  I don't care.  I just sign with my other hand.  No big deal.  I have also found that my baby can not comfortable sleep in this carrier.  If we are going for a long time, over nap time, and I want her to be able to sleep, we go back to the Boba where she will sleep both on the front - belly to belly and on the back.  Otherwise, ease of use it amazing.  I can insert baby in less than a minute.  My squirmy toddler will stay in my arms much longer while in a sling.  She loves being in it and gets excited and giggly when I take it out.  I can also take her out and let her run for a few minutes and pop her right back in.  Walking around with an empty sling feels like fashion statement (a sash or something).  I really don't have enough good things to say about this product, though I wanted to point out some limiting things I have found.
B00K347B6E|5|Love! Love! Love!  I got the 'Treetops' print and they are absolutely adorable.  Girly without being baby-ish.  Super cute pattern.  The weight is perfect for swaddling in warm weather.
B008BJ79XS|5|I love my ubbi diaper pail and these work great in the pail, bags have never ripped on us, they contain smell well.  Highly recommended.
B00DNBA82S|2|We had used an IP Foscam camera for a bit but decided we'd prefer a WIFI baby monitor.  We had tried the Motorola and while impressed, we weren't willing to shell out the bucks for it.  This Foscam has pretty darn good IR picture (not as good as Motorola), good sound, and the menu and buttons are IMHO easy to understand and use while half awake.  Battery life is decent; so far, goes about 4 hours with screen always on.  Screen can be turned off with one button unless triggered by a sound like, oh say, a baby crying.  We always have a white noise machine on around 5 feet away (about as loud as a shower... ~75dB) from the monitor and at the lowest setting for sound detection, it's enough to trigger the screen to come back on intermittently.<br /><br />Can't tell if it's messing with the WIFI internet signal because we have Comcast, which sucks to begin with.  So I guess if it is interfering, it's not interfering much.<br /><br />Small things I wish for to make this camera better:<br />1.  I wish the power cord for the camera were a foot or two longer. Though Foscam does sell extensions for this.<br />2.  It's a baby monitor, for goodness sakes.  Why put a bright green light on the camera?!?  Some people are trying to keep the room as dark as possible so the baby sleeps better.  Get rid of the darn light, Foscam!<br />3.  Separate thermometer.  Baby monitors are placed pretty high sometimes and since heat rises, I don't really know what the temp is like a few feet down where the baby is.  The gradient of heat in the room isn't the same all the time so can't just subtract two or three degrees.<br /><br />Overall, though, this monitor is definitely worth the price and works great.<br /><br />UPDATE: 6/21/14: So the adapter is acting up after 4 months of use.  It will not charge the hand unit without a great deal of force exerted onto the plug.  Contacted Foscam and am sending the monitor and plug in for replacement.<br /><br />7/14/14: After 3 weeks of sending back, receiving and receiving again (since not all parts were returned at once), Foscam has sent me back a monitor unit and adapter that HAS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM!  Nothing has been fixed.
B001I3PQHU|1|I was replacing a similar one that had its cliock parts wear out...was gonna surprise my wife. This was much too small
B00FE8BJ6C|5|I purchased this for my 17 month of daughter and her twin brother (he got the monkey).  I am so glad that I made this purchase...they love them and so do I (they are now leaving my bags alone).  These bags are the perfect size for their cups, snacks, small toys, and at times we use them for diapers and wipes.  There's a latch in the front so the straps won't fall off and a small pocket on the side. We do not use the strap (leash) that comes with it since we were primarily looking for a backpack that wouldn't be too big.  I recommend this to anyone looking for the perfect sized bag for their little one(s).
B00IFYDJ74|5|Love
B00ITCFE02|1|Did not like but needed quick fix, the hooks they sent to use did not work at all . I had to us double face tape. They darken room but need alternative way to hang. Would not recommend
B00005QI1H|4|I really am glad to have this swing.  We have a large two story home and I keep this swing downstairs for when I am doing chores down there.  We were contemplating buying another large swing for downstairs, but since my sister lives in Indiana and we visit quite often I thought this swing would be best because I can take it traveling.  It works wonderful.  If is so light and portable.  The music and lights and toys keep my daughter occupied for a long time.  When she is sleeping I just turn off the music and lights. They also go off by themselves.  There is a mode that turns the music and lights on when she plays with the toys.  She is only 3 months old and can just bat at them, but it works.  She likes that.  The motor on the swing is loud, but it doesn't seem to bother her.  I was blessed with a baby who can sleep through anything.  If your child is noise sensitive this is not the swing to get to calm him/her.  Use it for stimulation and play time.  I take this with me everytime I visit my sister in Indiana or just for a quick trip downtown to Grandma's house.  It is just the most handy thing.
B000056JHI|5|This gate works just as it says and it's a decent price.  I needed a 2nd gate because I'm fostering dogs and there are areas only my cats allowed to be, so I have a couple of these gates up just high enough on the wall (door frame) to allow the cats to slip under and not the dog... also because it's placed slightly higher up on the wall, the dog cannot jump over it.
B004AFUGVY|3|So the Mclaren coffee and sky blue stroller is a nice umbrella stroller worth about what I paid which was 160.  It arrived assembled which was nice and convienant. The stoller rides nice, and turns nice. The padding is perfect although you might want to purchase shoulder pads for the straps.  Also this stroller is about 12lbs which is nice and comes with a carrying strap. The stoller also reclines which is nice and It folds and unfolds easily.  Word of advice purchase a organizer to make things easy to carry this stoller has no cup holder. Overall a good purchse for the price.
B001R1SOSG|5|My daughter was born 3 weeks early with severe jaundice and we were forced to supplement her with formula... I was set on breastfeeding her and it was proving to be just impossible to get her to do it because bottles were so much easier, until I found and bought these bottles! I used them for 3 days and she decided that breastfeeding would be easier! These bottles are great!
B0077235JC|4|Great idea just wish it was taller. It doesn't fit most of the princess dresses that are a size 4
B006ZISSFA|5|We've only had this car seat for about a week so any praise we give should be considered preliminary. It seems to be a very sturdy car seat. Our delicious 7-month old granddaughter seems to find it comfortable. We fear all to soon she will outgrow it, but for now it is quite perfect.
B003GSLCOG|4|I love Thirsties covers, they are made out of excellent fabric that does not leak and the leg gussets are what set them apart from other covers. I ordered both the snap and the velcro closure covers, and I am surprised to say that I prefer the velcro. I have been using both types for 3 months and I have never been able to find a perfect fit with the snaps. I still use them, but as soon as the velcro covers are clean I find myself reaching for those first. I had hoped the snaps would be best because velcro clings to other fabrics and is more annoying to wash. I have found as long as I stick the velcro closure to the wash tab inside the diaper before laundering, I do not have a problem.
B00D309H7G|5|Just what I needed! All original parts for a great price.
B000CSBP18|5|this thing is a lot of fun!  I am enjoying it very much.  Hours of fun for the whole family.
B002YQQQJW|4|Great product!  First, I bought one of the Beaba food containers, which isn't nearly as good.  I also bought containers from Babies R Us that popped open in the freezer and never shut properly again after the first use.  These containers actually work.  I like the screw lid versus snap lid.  I also love that they are microwave safe and can be stacked in the freezer.  I bought two sets and might order more.  Just wish they qualified for free shipping.
B00AJSJE6O|4|If you carefully follow all of the directions provided, this item is not all that difficult to assemble, but it does come in many pieces so it does take some time. I was able to do it myself. My grandson seems to enjoy all the bright colors. Make sure you stock up on AAA batteries thoughts as it takes quite a few!
B00068O22S|2|Not that great as it actually entices kids to play with it ... should have not been a loose fit!!
B002J4U8M0|5|Great mirror for tummy time!
B002ATHE6M|3|My dresser arrived in a timely manner.  Upon unpacking, we found a small chunk of wood missing (dime size) from the side of the dresser.  The damage had to have been done before the item was packed because there was no damage to the packing materials.  Amazon gave me a small credit, but I am disappointed in the quality control of the manufacturer.  Overall, it's a pretty sturdy piece, but if you unpack it and find damage, you won't want to go through the hassle of repacking and shipping it back.  It is REALLY heavy!!
B003ZUXQY4|5|very nice and fits my chicco keyfit 30 perfectly
B00PJRBUEY|5|Nice pillow!! My 4 yr old granddaughter loves it
B00NX57B42|5|This thing is great and my baby loves it. I had a traditional bounce seat & baby did not like it very much.  The 3 position reclining is perfect, the mobile with nice music/lights is just right & not annoying, the adjustable shade works great. Does take a few minutes to assemble but nothing too difficult. Worth the money!!
B000I2WB6G|5|I love this bouncer!  Not only does it vibrate, but it also helps the baby practice hand-eye coordination AND cause and effect (that's right, science at 3 months). I love watching the huge smiles my babies give when they hit the animals and the waterfall lights up. They smile and talk to the animals.  Their arms and legs are constantly moving (great baby exercise). Other great features: very light and easily portable, and can be adjusted to have the baby lay more or less upright (depending upon your preference).  We also use this to help with digestion.  After the babies eat, we need to keep them upright for about 15 minutes before putting them down for their nap; this bouncer allows the baby to be upright and have the vibrating motion help ease out any latent bubbles (while we get their swaddles ready and make sure their humidifer is filled).  We went to Babies R Us to get a similar one, so that the twins have variety.  However, to our disappointment the other bouncers did not offer the same level of action-reaction toys on the bouncer.  Most of the other bouncers had just stuffed animals that hang from a bar (how boring).
B006P05SHY|5|This definitely helps when I give my lo a bath!  My knees and back aren't so achy now, and I can really enjoy bath time!
B007BLO8B8|5|I purchased this crib for my first child, it is absolutely gorgeous!! I have little patience so I put this together by myself....the instructions were well written, it took me about 4 hours - 2 hands definetely would of halfed that! Would recommend!!!
B001OC5UMQ|5|Keeps the dogs in their area.  Excellent find.  Fits the doorway perfectly.  Would definitely buy another Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate.
B00J6271X2|5|Its really nice for the price!
B00MJJJ6KA|5|This fit perfectly around my 5 month olds neck, I did see a change in the amount of drooling and fussing she has been doing, this Amber necklace thing really does work.. I was very skeptical in the beginning but I would recommend this to anyone trying solutions to stopping teething pain or drooling. It's all very cute on her she has gotten a lot of compliments. Love this little necklace :)
B00QS1UUGY|5|My 18 month old grandson loves his new cups. they work great and they really are spill proof.<br />I just ordered 2 more sets. anyone who's bought the wow cups know the lid comes in 2 piece's and<br />if you don't put them together just right they'll leak right down their little shirts and on the carpet!<br />these lids just screw in but work the same way. I highly recommend the sassy cup.
B000I62M84|5|The most important part of the whole seat is the ducks head and the slope down around the duck's feet. This provides a true barrier for preventing little boys from peeing over the seat onto the floor in front of the toilet when sitting. Other seats have the raised part in front of the seat, but becuase the legs are not any lower their penis can point straight out and sent pee over the small barrier.  This was the thrid seat that I tried for a potty training boy. This seat is easy enough for him to take on and off by himself, and secure enough when on that he can climb on by himself. He did use a step to get on at the start, but a year later he still uses it but with out the use of a step.
B0080E68TU|5|This sleep sack was a great way to tansition our 4 month old daughter out of the swaddle. She loves her sleep sack and won't sleep without it. She especially loves the minky fabric.
B00192MCF4|3|I was looking for a booster seat because the high chair just got in the way. I put my two year old in the booster seat and she is almost to big for it. The tray is so small she just knocks food off of it. She looks like a giant in this seat and she is no giant. This is more for children two and under in my opinion.
B00H3X7ZSW|1|I thought &#34;Hey, this will be perfect to block the sun for our baby!&#34;.  NO.  Just don't.  No matter how many times I have tried, the suction cups pop off.  It takes FOREVER to even get it on the window -- and when it is, be certain it will fly off and hit you or your child in the face.  Don't waste your time.
B000S35QLC|2|We registered for these monitors before the birth of our daughter.  The reviews were pretty good and honestly, we didn't want anything other than the ability to hear her should she cry.  We didn't need video, or zooming or motion detecting - she sleeps just a room away from our main living space, so it's easy to check on her when she's sleeping.<br /><br />Aside from that, Sony usually puts out a good product.<br /><br />With that, we struggled with these from the very beginning.  The \\"charged\\" battery does not last long at all - usually less than three hours.  Which means, you have to hook it up to the cord each night after the baby goes to bed.  I could deal with that issue and decided to keep giving them a try.<br /><br />Then, one day, they started going silent as opposed to the white noise I would hear from the sound machine in her room.  I tried everything and the only way I could get them to work was to continuously turn them off and then on again.  Finally, a few days later, the out of range alarm was non-stop.  And, again, we're only about 30 feet from her room.<br /><br />So, alas we have returned them and I am looking for something else.
B0094JP0YE|5|I ordered this to go to the beach and I was very pleased with it. It did help keep my 5 month old cool while we were walking around with stroller I all so used to it on the beach I just clipped it on a sun shade. The batteries last longer then I thought they would too. Did what I wanted it to.
B001I481LM|4|I have twins who were born prematurely and this is perfect for mixing the higher calorie formula they need as well as mixing a greater amount at one time since I have double the bottles to make. I only give it 4 stars because you can only mix up to 32 ounces and even at that amount it will leak out the top while you are mixing, I usually set it in the sink so it does not make a mess. Also, because of how the handle fits on it over time becomes loose and the clip that adjusts on the pumping mechanism eventually slides to the bottom which defeats it's purpose (unless I am not being gentle enough! ). Overall it's great for mixing larger quantities of formula which is why I purchased it.
B00IBIBM96|5|My niece loves this! She's just starting to learn to move in it and she loves playing with the buttons so she can bob her head to the music.
B005PK1G76|5|This is an awesome accessory. I purchased it for the Britax stroller. It fits perfectly!!
B00QHKAVBK|3|It's OK I just wish the recline all the way back
B008CFR7AQ|5|The absolute best toy for babies through toddler. I bought several to have on hand for last minute baby shower and 1st birthday gifts.
B001FB567U|1|looks good, lots of good reviews, says it comes with a crib mount, but actually got it today with a sticker tha says \\"crib mount removed\\". so basically, $200 down the drain, what the hell do i do with a monitoring system that does not monitor because i cannot place it anyway. its its not something you can through together for a mounting system, not pleased.
B001OC5UMQ|5|Liked it so much we purchased one for the top of the stairs.  Easy to install and works great.
B0015V3NPM|2|This product is very hard to assemble. Parents want something good and easy to put together. Time is precious.
B00LEALMTI|4|Was nice , was disappointed that it was not an actual blanket and no pillow cases
B000MRLYHE|3|I bought this cup because I liked that it had the soft spout and that it was BPA free. This cup doesn't work for my 7 month old, however, because it has too slow of a flow. My baby gets frustrated trying to drink from it and just gives up. I tried sucking on it and you really do have to suck HARD. This might be great for a baby going straight from breast to cup, but my baby is going from fast flow nipples to a cup and this just isn't the one for us.
B000G7YLDE|5|This was a 'from ONLY dad' gift for my infant son.  It's hilarious to see a tiny baby face with these grotesque teeth.  He loved all the extra attention it brought.  My wife eventually got used to it. :)
B000PRUAFI|5|bought 2 open boxes, they are awesome!
B00R63HI90|3|Toilet seat is cute. My daughter loves Minnie Mouse so this was perfect. It's lightweight and easy to carry around if need be. However, I have an elongated toilet and it does not stay in place. It doesn't seem to bother my daughter but I can't let her get on the potty by herself now. I'm trying to figure out what I can do to make it stay put, but so far nothing is working. I bought this to replace her &#34;training toilet&#34; but I think I might just go back to it since she can use that one on her own.
B001ISJWPC|4|When I ordered this swaddle blanket for my granddaughter, I mistakenly thought it was a swaddle blanket with the velcro tabs that swaddle. When I received it and saw the size, I wasnt so sure this is what I wanted or that my daughter would want. They were visiting here, my daughter loved it. Sometimes my granddaughter loves to be swaddled while you are holding her during a fussy period, this blanket is the perfect size, she is 4 months old and 13 lbs. My daughter loves that it has its own bag, she keeps it in her diaper bag or purse. The blanket is very soft, and washes  beautifully.I would recommend this swaddle blanket to anyone. It also comes with a cap for baby!
B000067EH7|1|We had been using the Summer Infant fold away tub for the past few months, but while convenient and small, we've found that our 3 month old is no longer comfortable in it.  So upon a few recommendations and reviews we bought the First Years Infant to Toddler tub.  Only thing though is that we give him baths on his changing table, since it's very hard on our backs to do in a bath tub and our sink is too small.  When I put water in the tub, there's a pretty bad leak that comes from the drain area underneath.  We returned it (purchased at Babies R Us) for another, thinking we had a defective one.  Second one had the same exact issue.  It's' a shame since it doesn't seem that hard to make a tub with a drain that seals better (the fold-away we have is fine in that regard).  So while the little froggy drain is cute, it doesn't work.  So we're going to have return this one again and find a tub that is comfortable and can hold water properly.
B00EOJ08BO|2|It's fine, but I'm with the other reviewers...thought I was getting 2, not just one.
B000P7WAII|5|Just got this high chair a few weeks ago and I love it.  It looks just like the ones in restaurants.  The color is a beautiful rich mahogony.  I had to put it together but the instructions were easy and it only took about 15 minutes.  My 19 month old daughter loves it.  I couldn't get her out of it for the first few days.  She can sit at the table with her older siblings.  I purchased a large plastic placemat just for her and it works just as well as any high chair tray.  I also love that she will be used to using this style so when we go to restaurants, she is comfortable.  Overall, great looking, great price, fast shipping and the shipping was free with Amazon Prime.  Very Happy!
B000067EH7|4|...and we do too. We've had this since our daughter was born and started using it around 3 weeks. The infant insert works absolutely great. We used it until she was 2 1/2 months old and around 9 1/2 pounds. Our LO is petite but very strong and at about 21 inches + she would arch her back and also push her feet  to the tub's edge when she was on the net, which was a little dangerous, so we decided to remove it and bathe her on the baby side since she cannot sit up on her own yet. She loves that side now! The water is deep enough to keep her warm and happy as she kicks her legs and arms, but not so deep as to reach over her belly. Still, someone needs to be there at all times. Needless to say the tub needs to be cleaned at least once a week. And a funny sorta funny note: If the water is warm your baby may poop while in it (she will definitely pee) so keep an eye on that too! I didn't give it 5 stars because it is kinda bulky and definitely does not fit under some (I would say many) tubs. For us that was not a problem, but I can see how others may consider this inconvenient
B001V9KPBI|5|Really unique.....Where were these when I was having babies !!!
B00076PR9G|1|AWFUL AWFUL!! High price for a CHEAPLY made product. OH and their customer service is a joke. Tried to order replacement parts that were covered under warranty and received a run around. Took 6 weeks to get the wrong part!!!!!! The rating got one star because I could not give it less.
B003TFZ184|4|I've had this mat for 4 months and so far it's doing exactly what I bought it for, keeping my two year old from sliding around in the tub. We do have hard water, so it is starting to get a little bit of buildup, but otherwise it looks great.
B006P05SHY|5|Not too big, not too small. Firm and soft at the same time. Perfect for what I needed to give my knees a break while bathing the kid :)
B001COIH3A|5|I LOVE this Monitor!!!!  This was for my 3rd child.  I still have my old analog baby monitor that we bought when my first was born. We now use it with our 2nd born, b/c the digital one we bought for him completely died & stopped working!    I thought for our 3rd I'd get a less expensive monitor. I purchased the Sony 900 MHz baby monitor. Well, when it worked, it would be clear & good, but that's ONLY when it worked! That monitor drove me CRAZY!!!! It got so much interference from anyone & anything around it.  When my kids weren't keeping me up at night, this monitor would keep me & my husband up. I was ready to destroy it-ha!    So I found this Avent Monitor. I knew the Graco digital monitor wasn't all that great,so I saw good reviews for this one.  Well, OH MY Goodness, it was AWESOME & still is!  Compared to my annoying last monitor this one gets NO interference & works like a charm!!! It was worth the extra money for sure!  I can actually carry it around & move it without it going bonkers on me! :)    The only negative is it could stand to go up in volume a little, but other than that. This is the ideal monitor!!  LOVE IT!!!
B007IPLTGO|5|I love miYim stuff and these are really cute.
B003MIPPX4|5|We are going for a nautical theme for our nursery, and I just love this diaper bag and the whole Nautica Kids William collection. Everything seems to be really good quality, and on top of that -- it's just so cute! :)
B000067K0L|5|The moment I put my daughter down she kicked and swatted at the dangling toys.  I had never seen her so entertained and active.  In fact, this mat got her to roll over!  So, in my book it's worth any amount of money.  It breaks down easy for travel and you can machine wash it.  The music it plays is soft and pleasing.  Skye likes to look in the mirror and \\"talk\\" to herself.  Actually, she \\"talks\\" to the toys too.  I rotate them to keep her attention.  Only recommendation would be to purchase the kick wind chime.  She loves kicking and grabbing it.
B00440CZPU|5|Perfect!!!
B00AFV5E1O|4|He loves it but the only tag he plays with is the actual tag.
B0045JKUU2|5|Great price!  The toys are great.  They attach to the feeding tray and are easily removed.  The chair reclines back so it is easy to slide your child in and out.  It took about 45 minutes to assemble.  Definitely recommend!
B004IY6AGW|5|great shower gift
B0038W0PJS|5|We used the Halo sacks on my daughter until she was over 4 months old.  We swaddled her in them until she was able to roll over while being swaddled (around 15 weeks old).  After she could roll, she still slept in them but we swaddled her with her arms out.  I think she liked the warm and tight feeling they gave her.  I absolutely LOVED the Disney princess Halo sack.  It was nice and warm (microfleece) and had just he amount of girliness that I was looking for.  To be honest, I'm super bummed that they only make this one in a newborn size.  I would have loved to have it in the next size up.
B001O0DIJA|5|Bought this because my 14 month old LOVED to toss cups and such overboard while shopping, and we would often lose items due to her \\"game.\\" Now we strap the juice or snack cup to her stroller or the shopping cart, and we don't worry about losing it! And, it's an even better \\"game\\" for her now because she can throw something over, and then retrieve it herself!
B004LWZZ2G|2|The tiny size of the bowls is perfect for making 1 baby food at a time for my 6 month old just starting out on solids. I wanted bowls with lids so I could use them both to store and serve food. The lids are on so tight that it's tempting to use your fingernails to try to pry the lid off, but I'm afraid I'll snap my nails right off from the force I have to use. Plus, the lids seem difficult to get on as well. I will probably go the route of another reviewer and ditch the lids for good.
B00MEU1C1K|5|Very pleased with the ease and quality of this decal! Love that it's removable for renters and the directions are spot on easy!! Very fun! Definitely will be adding more of these to my children's rooms!
B00AA6LQKM|1|There ARE better options out there ... not happy. I like the size of the pop and the handle, it works in that respect, but trying to get them out was a hassle. Even running them under hot water - tough. I used it only 2 times and it broke into a million pieces trying to get the pop out. I recommend the soft pop holders, they aren't hard to remove such tiny frozen items from.... and don't shatter. Wish I could return it. oh well.
B005UAKGAE|5|So cute in my granddaughters nursery! Really adds to the room and looks so cute with the whole set!  She has the whole set now and this is a perfect addition.
B00AA6LQKM|5|I have only used these for breast milk so far but they are perfect for my teething baby. Things do get quite messy (obviously) but just have a cloth nearby or a bib and you're good to go. Can't fault them, so glad I have them.
B0018CJ7G2|4|I guess I am happy with the product though I don't know why they cost twice more than my sis' Cosco car seat which seems to have more functions. They could have at least put a padding on the seat belt.
B00QKXTQ42|5|Easy to install & works great!
B00S5E9IA6|4|NICE FOR WHAT I NEEDED THEM FOR.  NICE PRICE.  DOES HAVE A CARDBOARD BOTTOM SO THE LARGE ONE COULD NOT REALLY HOLD ANYTHING REALLY HEAVY
B008HCXIU2|1|Did work with our car's weird headrests, which consist only of bars.  Oh well.  Off to try another brand.  :(
B000P635T2|5|So happy I found this! It turned a closet into something I can actually use and my kids cant get in!! Woohoo!!
B0038JDUYI|5|Got to have it, but with complaints. It doesn't hold a lot of food, and there are some crevices that can hold food so wash well. However, this is a sturdy spoon so that you can push baby's jaw down and shovel in the food!
B00AVT0YKG|5|Exactly as pictured. Arrived on time. Very satisfied with purchase. It will be fun to compare each month's pictures to see how my baby's size compares to the sticker size!
B000F78UAU|4|I bought this for my expectant daughter.  Is more comfortable than I anticipated. Quality appears to be good although it has not been used much to date.
B001QFYPM2|5|Excellent product, high quality. This worked wonderfully on our last vacation for my 6 year old and  year old. Very happy with the purchase!
B001OC5UMQ|1|Pressure mounts did not keep the gate very stiff & stable.  If I had pushed hard enough on it, it would fall over - probably not a problem for a baby because I'm lots stronger and a baby would never push that hard.  When walking thru the gate opening, it was very narrow - my husband hated it and he's not a big, heavy guy.  We all hated having to step over the piece of metal at the bottom, however, we did get used to doing it ,so after a while it was not a problem.  Overall, we all hated the gate.  Would never buy this again.
B003IXNUS0|5|Worked great for our wandering four year old visiting nyc. Lots of versatility in the lengths of straps available for different situations, e.g. Rush hour on a subway vs a meander through the park. Our son was happy exploring, we were happy knowing he was within a safe distance to us. He dropped the handle only a couple times early on after which we told him he would then have to hold hands, but then soon had no trouble remembering. We noticed when we came back home  and were no longer using it, our son would instinctively make sure his hands were on us or on my bag in the parking lot and in crowded situations. Great buy.
B0007YXUYC|3|In the future I won't buy bedding online. The softness or thickness isn't quite what I would have hoped. It's a nice looking set for something not gender specific but if I could do it again I would have bought something I could touch and feel first for a lot less than I paid. The vendor/shipping was fine. Just not thrilled with my product choice.
B000KNTQQ6|4|I like this car seat as it is easy to take in and out of the car.  It is a larger seat for toddlers only, not babies.  The color and fabric are pretty and easy to clean up.  We take the back off frequently and use it as a booster seat which works great.  You need to be careful and make sure this is the right seat for your vehicle.  It works fine for most cars that it has been in but I don't think it is the safest for my CRV.  The way the seat belts are doesn't give it much support.  This car seat should be used with an over the shoulder seat belt.
B0042D69XI|5|I bought this for my niece for Christmas. She had just turned 1, four days before Christmas too. When she saw what it was she smiled big. She smiled even more when her dad opened it and gave her one. I really loved how colorful they were and love the textures too. I think these are definitely worth buying but I wouldn't suggest a child too little. Although they are teethers, they are a little big especially the purse and ring parts but of course all kids are different and you never know.
B00000IZPT|5|I bought this for Christmas when my son was 4 months old, and we have gone through numerous batteries since then from EXTENSIVE use!  I selected this product because of the remote feature, and have used it often when he would was having trouble settling down - but I didn't want to enter the room and let him see me.  As he got older, he would amuse himself for long periods of time by turning it on &amp; off and watching the lights as the music played.  He will also turn it on when he wakes up in the middle of the night -- and goes back to sleep without my having to go in there and tend to the musical myself.  Now, at 15 months, he also loves to turn it on with the remote when he is playing in his room.  I take it with me whenever we are going to be away overnight and would recommend it highly to anyone!
B003MCS29O|5|Very cute, this was exactly what we were looking for, for my daughter's purple room! Cute flowers that pop out from lamp. Also sturdy!
B008HRJKEU|5|Very useful and playful for the child.
B0038JE3R6|5|i love.it. very cushionable. able to wipe off with wipes. durable. very useful. good price.
B009EDSWJA|5|We use it for changing diapers and also for bed and bumper when baby sleeps in between us.  Its not recommended use but works for us.
B005SZP22S|5|My toddler girls love this.  It is sturdy and will last a long time.
B00E3RKC36|5|Excellent
B001G5ZQ7A|5|This is a perfect baby book that truly captures all moments of your child's years of life.<br /><br />Very good quality, well thought out that leaves the guess work of Mom's wondering what moments to capture.<br /><br />I have 2 of them for both of my children!
B000Y1UDBQ|4|This halter is incredibly comfortable - I honestly can't imagine pumping without it now.     I cut off the top straps to make it a tube top.  it still fits firmly enough to hold everything and it's easier and quicker on and off.
B00CNGPT5A|5|This is a awesome product it fit so well in my back seat and its not just for kids I put all my paper work in there.... I love it.. It also helps with all the clutter I had in my car.. I highly recommend this to anyone even if you don't have children it really helps keep things Organize ..
B005YYS47I|5|This crib sheet is incredibly soft, has maintained its shape and fit after over 60 washings to date, and is a nice light color that may not match \\"exactly\\" to your bedroom theme but definitely wouldn't clash.  I bought the yellow with dots for the Wisconsin fall/winter/spring seasons and loved it so much I bought the green with dots afterwards.  The colors are light pastels with espresso-colored dots and tastefully fit in our little girl's bedroom not to mention the espresso crib they occupy.  I stayed with gender neutral as the quality is so high, I feel they will last through more than one child.  Infants do not have bedding sets and snooze in sleep sacks.  So, no worries about the sheet not matching your butterfly/dinosaur theme.  And the yellow is a pale, pastel yellow, not khaki as one reviewer stated.  Nor is the sheet too large or shrink after washed.  BOTTOM LINE: soft, high-quality, and well-fitted sheet that is fit for your little princess or prince and any future siblings.
B00MJG48DS|5|My baby loves these!!
B005NLETV2|5|This is a beautiful night light that gives off a bright glow, especially in a dark room.  The crystals are lovely, and I am going to give this as a gift to my friend for her birthday.  I hope she enjoys it as much as I do.
B0042D69XS|1|Beware! This is extremely unsafe! I hated the placement of the control panel when I had my first child. Luckily she didn't care much for the chair. My second (2mo) enjoys it. However, she was happily kicking today and then suddenly started screaming with blood gushing from her ankle. This chair is absolutely UNSAFE for babies and should be recalled. I will be calling Fisher Price first thing on Monday.
B00DJP14TE|4|For the money this is a good backpack.  It is easy to put on and fits several of my kids from ages 3 to 8 months.  Its light weight and folds up decently flat for truck or closet storage.  I put it at 4 stars because the sternum strap doesn't adjust up or down, its sown onto the main straps.  If you adjust the backpack so most of the weight is on your waist, depending on your size you might have to lengthen the main straps, this causes the sternum strap to get right up under your neck.  I'm 5'11&#34; just about average in all measurements so i never thought of myself as a &#34;tall&#34; person, but I'm taller than this was designed for.  Also the good part the kids usually fall asleep in a few minutes, but its really hard to get them out without waking them up.  The buckle releases are sort of deep inside of the &#34;sitting&#34; area so you end up feeling around them for a bit trying to get the buckles un-done and they usually wake up.  Not the best design there.  I kept mine and use it a few times a week, knowing what I know now, I might look closer at the details for my next one.
B000GK5XY2|5|I absolutely love these fresh food feeders. They can be used when baby is still too small for food but may have started teething. You can put an ice cube or a frozen cube of breast milk or formula inside of them and let a teething baby chew on it. And it's great for fruits, veggies, pretty much any food that you can fit inside of it! We continued to use one with my son after he had gotten a few teeth and it didn't tear or wear out. They can be a little messy, but then feeding a baby anything gets messy, no matter what you do. I always recommend these to friends and I'm on my second set with my second baby.
B008VFEHC8|5|I purchased this product by mistake thinking that i got the whole chair, i guess clicked on the wrong link, but let me tell you the pros of this purchase anyway: First, it was shipped on time, second, the product was unspoiled and the pad set was complete and clean, and third, and the most important for me, is that the provider was comprnhensive about my mistake and reenversed the money as soon as it got the product back. I'm glad they answered my request way sooner than i expected and that they gladly helped.
B001D7HLTW|4|Great product. My teething baby grabs and chews on the zipper area so it's great that it zips from top to bottom. Otherwise I would worry about her breaking and accidentally swallowing the zipper pull tab.
B002UP391K|5|We can easily put two of these and an infant car seat across (Prius, Ford Escort, and Nissan Pathfinder).  Once all the kids are older, there will be no problem for three of these to go across.<br /><br />Features I really like:<br />1.  Five point harness<br />2.  Color and fabric<br />3.  Sliding headrest<br />4.  Easy to install and adjust<br />5.  Converts to a regular booster<br /><br />Features I wish I didn't have to live without:<br />1.  Movable arm rests<br />2.  Cup holders
B000XPWXK2|5|Love these!! Protects clothes from drink dribble and catches food crumbs! Easy to wipe clean for next meal.
B00BBKXGRM|1|I washed the slip cover, it was very difficult to take off and I cannot manage to put it back on.  Horrible cover!
B004KT82AM|5|Perfect and safe for my daughter
B002UKXLJK|4|So far, so good.  I bought these because I found myself in numerous situations when I couldn't nurse or pump when I wanted to, and wanted a way to get some relief.  While not completely discreet, if I wear a more firmly supportive nursing bra, I don't notice them so much under clothing.  Since I'm pretty self conscious about things, I haven't been too adventurous when wearing them, although I know they're not SO obvious that a looser blouse will conceal them.  I find myself using them in the car (until I get home or to wherever I can nurse or pump), around the house, and wearing one on the opposite side if where I'm nursing to collect extra milk.  Once cooler weather starts, I will definitely be wearing them for things like grocery shopping or any time I can hide them with a coat.  I wear a lot of scales, too, so I'm hoping they will be good under that so I can use them when I have to go longer between pumping at work (I'm a teacher).  So far, I've found myself getting at least 2 extra ounces a day, which is good to add to my pumped bottles.  I wish they were a little easier to pour out and to clean, but this is manageable.  I'm sure I will buy another set once I return to work, when cleaning and sanitizing them won't be so convenient.  I definitely recommend these!
B00DNQS6PO|5|Really Nice, They should provide instructions on how to fold this into a smaller size...
B001KZH692|5|The  newly pregnant mother sent thank yous and deeply appreciated me getting her what she wanted for her newborn child.
B001W2YCH2|5|Very happy with this product. However I forgot each side has a different firmness level and my LO has been sleeping on the softer toddler size since day one.
B00P21F4T4|4|Great liitle.pillow
B009NMO5CK|5|Fits 3 across!  I had 3 of these across the back seat in a 04 Nissan Sentra.  If they fit across in that car they'll fit anywhere!  I have since moved them to a 14 Ford F150 Crew cab and use one as a
B000069EXO|5|Perfect! It's warm, cozy and gives you peace of mind knowing that your baby is safe while sleeping. Also, mine didn't not have any smell to it!!!
B00VY30IJK|5|I am such a fan of these bathrobes, I have bought everyone that Baby-Steps has put out there.  They make the perfect present, and come in such different characters, that I can choose one per the personality of the child.  They are all well made, and arrive in such an elegant gift box, (you don't even have to gift wrap it).  I have found them to be well made, and arrive on time when they were suppose too.  I highly recommend this product as well as the others that Baby-Steps have to offer.  I have not been disappointed yet.
B0029DPGDW|5|Awesome value, especially for the price. They are a little small but I expected them to be. I was a little worried about using a wet bag with a draw string, but so far it works great! They're super cute and gender neutral as well.
B00067ELGG|4|My daughter loved this mobile.  When she woke up to eat, we always had to change her diaper first.  Of course, this also meant we'd have to wash our hands before feeding her, which would annoy her since she was already hungry. However, once we turned on the mobile, she would stay calm until I was ready.  I'm not sure why the other poster's mobile didn't work.  We haven't had any problems with it at all (it's been 6 weeks).  One thing to note though is that you should turn off the music as soon as you pick baby up because it uses up batteries rather quickly.
B00UI2BQO4|5|I have a lot of younger relatives and I just realized how much I needed this item. It scares me to be in vehicles with younger people because the world has really changed. Most of my relatives like to use this when they are running there own little ones. I didn't expect it to work as well it has but it is a great product.
B002SG7IXQ|5|Not an extraordinary doll, but nicely made and organic which is nice for sucking on. My granddaugher is 3 mo. old and seems to like looking at the face and grabbing the ponytail.
B005QU55EA|5|I have three kids 5-1 and they are great.  The one year old stays out of cupboards and the five year old can get them open. Totally would recommend!
B00D9C7FRC|1|Ordered the grey elephant as seen on the picture and got a lavander elephant instead. It is not what I wanted since the elephant was for a baby boy and the lavander colour is for a girl. Very disappointed.
B002UXQRES|4|I haven't found any leakage with these storage bags yet, and although I've read through the reviews and someone stated that you can write on these with a pen, it did not work for me. I use a fine point sharpie to write the date and amount, although there is no area for you to write an &#34;amount.&#34; The time slot seems unnecessary and I would prefer to have an amount slot instead (I write the amount above the date slot). There's a milk bag organizer for this, but I just freeze as is and it's just been overtaking my freezer (not such a bad thing).
B000KW5I6E|5|The boppy is great for breastfeeding and I definitely recommend buying a &#34;naked&#34; one, the covers you can get individually are definitely cuter than the ones that come with a boppy!
B000GZNGLE|3|If you don't care about your face looking too pale it is ok. I used it several times to go for mushrooms or just for walking on the open sun and it protects from the sun, the only issue is it is white lines on my face...I am adult so I don't and it is baby product and who cares if I look like I have a mask on my face))) as long as it is protected. Also with time it becomes watery and I keep forgetting to shake it before I open...
B00HWZZOH0|3|Nice but looks cheap in person
B0001NE8OA|5|I am flabbergasted at all the bad reviews for this product. I have the old diaper genie, and just bought my sister the new one, and we both love them! They are not hard to use, the new one is even easier than mine, and do contain the smell. I don't understand the frustration folks are having, especially the \\"lady with the master's degree.\\" This product does what it claims - it contains the smell, is not hard to empty, and makes our nursery a more pleasant place.
B001IXYOD2|5|Excellent, would recommend
B00JHMLN6C|5|The multi purpose and true travel stroller, compact and light.
B006JHD5V4|5|After reading the story about a kid who was able to swallow whole and began choking on his pacifier, I was freaked and so glad I chose these pacifiers. Base is large with not fear of choking. The little notch is great for my little guy's nose (his lil flat nose peeks out just above it but I think the round one would suffice too without obstructing any air passages). Not only are they made of natural materials (better for the environment and less likely to have toxins), they are adorable on...think Maggie Simpson ;)<br /><br />You do need to heed the manufacturer's recommendation and replace every few weeks (like you would a toothbrush) cause they kinda flatten out and become tacky. It's actually good practice to replace cause no matter how often you wash and sterilize, over time materials do wear and bacteria have more crevices to hang out longer.
B00STANWS0|5|how adorable and creative, happy to give as gifts
B00VQ2SHM4|5|Its cute and it carries lunches, what more can you ask for?
B000WU3DVG|4|This is perfect for Grandma's house (which is what I bought it for), but I'm glad I don't use it day in and day out at my house. It's not adjustable so unless you use the tray the child might be too low or too high depending on your table & chairs. But with the tray it works great. I know my child is safe and comfortable for meal time on the occasions she's at her grandparents' place.
B0012LZD4Y|4|Good quality and nice size. Don't shrink when washed. Don't pill up when washed.
B003TJAGBM|3|Overall, I liked the idea of having an adapter. I thought I could test out the bags, as I have tried others. I really dislike the bags. They were small, and the spout didn't really pour very well. I also didn't like the zipper part at the top. So, what I do is use bags I like by cutting a small slit in the middle below the name, then zipper around the adapter and the bags don't tear, work well and I know exactly how much I pumped. Works perfectly and is easier if I don't want to wash bottles.
B000FFL58Q|5|This mat was a no brainer for me after getting the [[ASIN:B000I2WAY4 Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing]] and seeing how wonderful the colors and brightness of the product are.  No, it is not meant for travelling and the mat is perfectly thick enough, even on my hardwood floors.<br /><br />The only issues I had with it was the amount of time spent trying to figure out how to get the butterflies to move (they don't) and that there are no extra rings to add length (a little short for a 3 month old to view AND grab at the same time) or to attach more of your own toys.  But those are insignificant and not problems compared to how many hours she has played with it and believe it or not, her activity on the playmat has tired her out so that she finally slept through the night!  That in it and of itself makes this worth so much more than I paid for it, as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />No matter which one you end up choosing, be sure to get a playmat.  It was incredible how quickly she has developed since we bought ours a week ago.  She \\"talks\\" so much more now, coos, smiles, laughs and just makes crazy noises and loves kicking the elephant rattle and looking at herself in the mirror.  Also, I posted some customer images for a better idea.  Enjoy! :D
B005537IFW|5|I love 5 this doll and so my 21 mo old daughter. I first bought her at Marshalls and then lost her. Those were the worst 3 days in that week, until I finally found it here in Amazon. This doll is my daughter's best friend! And I like the fact that is washable :)
B00B9ZHVFC|2|Not much space to write. Cute design.
B000G0KQWQ|4|Great swaddle blanket for younger babies, I was able to use this for my son until he is about 4-5 months. After that he got stronger and can always escape the blanket.
B00IM8G06A|1|these are terrible i will be using these for cleaning rags. they feel like sand paper i couldnt imagine washing my babys face with these
B00HBKOSFU|5|👍
B001GQ2P78|5|I've had this about 1 1/2 yrs. my son was a horrible sleeper as a baby and this saved us! To this day we use it every night and even bring it if we travel. The night light is very nice and not too bright: If I need to sneak in and take a peek this is perfect and also nice for night time diaper changes. One of our must have baby stuff investments!
B00GTX269A|5|Must have!!  I would never go without this product.  We have a six month old son and used this product first in his play yard (where he slept the first two months) with one pad.  It is now used with two pads in his crib.  This product works EXACTLY as it is supposed to work and provides us comfort at night knowing baby's movement and breathing is monitored.  I think we'd have been up a million times during the first few months checking on baby if it weren't for this product.  I highly recommend this product more than anything else we bought for our newborn.  It isn't cheap by any means but honestly I'd label it as priceless.....
B004GCJMHK|5|thanks
B00MZNU4CO|4|So far so good with this product.
B00OMSZE70|3|After weeks of reviewing many umbrella type strollers, this Joovy Groove Ultralight had my attention many times over.  Sadly, there are a few gripes I have in it.  First,  would be the little screw on the bottom frame facing upwards to the basket...i can see this as potentially ripping a hole on the basket itself or a bag that i put in it.  Secondly, this stroller is very stiff to unfold and refold, the manual calls for locking the rear wheels before doing either but by doing so, they rub pretty rough against the ground surface making it pretty annoying, difficult to open or close and ends up a little more time consuming setting it up or taking it down compared to my jogger.  Lastly, the wheels also make a fairly good amount of noise, you can hear the ball bearing rolling around inside, not a good thing when trying to keep my LO asleep.
B0045I6IAY|4|Great, our baby love it.
B00F2MQ5SM|3|could be a bit larger for a male toddler and the protection pee guard could be slightly taller... (it's great for a little girl)
B00JRYSDC2|5|Sturdy, simple and reasonable price.
B00E6VHOGM|5|I bought this for a friend and she loved it.  Her first baby and it helped her a lot.
B00J3EQ68E|5|This is a great ! I love all the compartments for cell phone , snacks , keys & drinks . Very handy & will be great for walks at the park & mall .
B002PTSPGA|4|Really cute! I wish the material were a little nicer but it is still a very cute pillowcase. My daughter loves Spongebob so this was perfect for her.
B00WQ2HO7M|1|These are way too small. Not true to size. Description says 6 months. Truly more like 3 months. My baby is small for 6 months, only in the 36th percentile for weight and the shirts won't snap they are so tight. Also not as shown in photo. Photo shows 2 snaps but there is only one interior snap and one exterior snap. Not well made.
B000MC3ROW|5|Best chopper ever!  We own a hot dog business and use this to chop the onions for the condiment bar  One onion two turns of the handle and done!  The last one we had lasted 4 years hundreds of onions  This one has some improvements that should make it last even longer!!
B002H37HMM|1|If I order something, I expect to get what is pictured and not something COMPLETELY different. It is not what you see in the photo at all. What I recieved is light green and purple lunchbox with a panda and a couple of cupcakes on it! This company needs to get glasses ASAP and change the photo! This is the first time this has happened to me on Amazon. Not cool.
B005KWP9H2|5|We love Kidsme Food Feeders! I have tried the mesh feeders (different brands). My daughter did not like chewing on them. I did not like them because of the mess they made! The mesh ones are so hard to clean. My daughter is 6 months old and can hold the Kidsme feeders independently! I freeze her favorite baby foods in the silicone sacs, and they are the perfect teether! They are a breeze to clean!  I have not used the mill or the scissors yet, but I'm sure I'll love them! I will be buying more to give as shower gifts!
B002VUBVMS|5|We purchased this play yard mainly for looks (and after verifying it's also safe), and love it.  I've read reviews from other sites that state to READ THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY when trying to set it up because it's a bit tricky, and I'm glad I knew that--saved a lot of frustration!  It is tricky at first, but a couple of times and you get the hang of it.  The travel bag is a much thicker canvas than the thin nylon that most play yards come with.  Play yard itself is very sturdy, and very modern-looking.  We aren't people who like pastel-colored, cartoony, baby-ish gear, and love the look of this play yard (which is why we paid a little more for this one).  The play yard mattress/pad on the bottom is very heavy and sturdy, and also has strong velcro to hold it down.  We feel very safe having our little one in there.  Highly recommended!
B011ZV9RV0|1|Buyer Beware..They are selling CAREPROST which is exactly same as Lumigan but different brand...I love my Careprost..got mine on maximumlashescom
B000BPQHF6|5|Fits the dream on me Mini Crib Mattress perfectly
B0018Z6910|5|This is a wonderful swing... It's very nice and soothing. Baby loves it and he's comfortable enough to take a nap in it. The fact that you can have it swing different ways it's a big plus. It's very cute as well and the materials used are very soft and cuddly. I have done lots of research before purchasing this one and I don't regret the choice. The price was very nice too.
B003XMWF28|1|The bowl and plate look wonderful and I'm sure my daughter would love them, but I'm afraid to open it and give it to her because the package came with 2 forks and no spoon. I would love to open it and give it to her but I haven't in fear of having to return the product. How can we correct this situation?
B00006GTC0|4|I purchased this entire set, throw pillows and all, for my folks as a housewarming gift. It looks great with their new, very expensive, contemporary bedroom furniture. My Mom, who has very expensive taste, was quite pleased with the set and couldn't beleive it came from Target.
B00BNQEZY2|5|Fantastic car seat, fits my tall one year old very well.<br /><br />Like others have stated, this is a VERY large seat.  You will have issues in mid-sized to smaller vehicles, if someone is sitting in front of it (if in rear facing mode).  I have tried in a 2014 Malibu and a 2015 Impala, both were tight fits, when seat is pulled forward.<br /><br />The cushioning is far superior to the Graco 35 pound seat I had and my son loves it so much more.  The two cup holders are being used for sippy cups and his different snacks.<br /><br />This seat was comfortable enough for him to sleep most of the time on a 20 hour drive from Iowa to Florida...twice.
1059875748|5|This is such a cute thing! It is hanging in my childrens toy room. It is so beautiful. The first thing people mention. It was simple to put up.
B009OC8714|5|Purchased this blanket for my 4 month old granddaughter and she LOVES it!!!  This blanket is sooooo soft.  We call this &#34;the magic blanket&#34;.  Put this up to her face to cuddle in and she is out cold within 2 minutes.  She loves this thing.  It's evident that she is going to be one of those kids that attaches to blankets.  And to get this kind of reaction to a blanket for a 4 month old is unreal!!  I have already purchased another one for a backup blanket when this one either worn out from use or in the washer.  Beware, the blanket states that it needs to be hand washed, BUT if you put the blanket in a lingerie bag or pillow case and put it in the washer then the dryer, it works just fine.  Its a stroller blanket, so it's not huge, but its a good size for kid that loves a blanket and can carry around with them with ease.
B000A6MPFC|5|I make my own baby food and I got both the freezer trays and the travel dish, so that I can pack food for my little guy to take to daycare.  It worked out great.  The food fits from the freezer trays right into this dish, so every night I popped them out of the trays and into the travel dish and put them in the refrigerator.  They defrosted overnight and my little one had food for daycare the next day.  Having the spoon right there was great too.
B001TUZOBA|2|This is not a pump for moms who are going to pump multiple times a day! I bought this pump while expecting my first child. I wanted the medela but I wasn't sure if breast feeding was going to work for us or not so I decided to take the cheaper route. My son never latched on very well and by six weeks I was pumping exclusively. First I'll name the pros to this pump: it's easy to set up and figure out, it is fairly quiet, especially with a blanket over you, it's easy to take apart and clean, and it's very light. However, the cons far outweigh the pros. First, the buttons are very difficult to push while holding the shields on both breasts. I finally figured out a way to do it with my elbow. Second, it is not super efficient. I happened to have an overwhelming milk supply so it worked okay for me and my milk loss was very gradual. The pump gradually lost suctioning power over the first six months. Then, at 6 am one morning, it stopped working completely. It literally would not even turn on. We live in a small town and Walmart is the only place to buy a breast pump within two hours of us. By the time I got ready to go, I was completely engorged, my baby was starving, and we were forced to buy another lansinoh pump. I thought maybe I'd gotten a defective pump and was hoping for the best. Once again, the pump gradually lost suctioning power and by the time my son was ten and a half months old I had lost my supply completely.<br /><br />This is just my experience! I tried calling lansinoh and they were not very helpful- gave me some suggestions, none of which worked. We are expecting another child in August and I'll definitely be purchasing the medela pump in style advanced. Do your research and save yourself the heartache and guilt of not being able to provide for your baby as long as you'd wanted. By the time I bought two of these pumps it added up to the amount of would have spent on the medela anyway! Good luck mommas!
B004Y0UU5W|1|The bottle is very bulky. Much bigger than the picture seems to be. Also the nipple did not work well at all. LifeFactory is much better. Although I do like that it can store milk with a plug
B001FBDC0I|5|I loved it.  I was looking for this exact frame because I have my the same one for my first grandchild's birth picture and wanted a matching frame for my second grandchild.  Extremely happy I was able to find this.
B004IY3CBS|1|This seemed like a good idea at first.  The little stuffed animal is soft and cute, but I didn't like the way it forced the baby to keep the pacifier when the pacifier might not have been wanted.  Newborns aren't able to move it away or spit it out because of the stuffed animal holding it in place.  Then I began to wonder if she began spitting up/vomiting (she has reflux) if it would cause her to choke.  So, I think this would be good for older babies, but definitely not newborns.
B004LLDOCA|4|Easy way to decorate daughters room now and change later when she is tired of it! Used on headboard, chair and dresser mirror.
B000CP85U0|1|The recipes in this box are fine. I do make one recipe regularly. The problem is that there are so very very few recipes in all. There are a lot of sections but the cards go on and on about the basics of nutrition and some sections that seem like they should have a recipe or two in them (Dessert? I was curious what they would have for a dessert for a toddler, well, I am still wondering) but they don't, they just discuss the topic. That is fine and interesting but they are so obviously filler for a lack of recipe ideas that it is frustrating since that is what I purchased this for. Also, there are multiple recipes on each card and finding anything again can be difficult. I guess I would have preferred a book and so I will now use this experience to form future purchases.
B002QYW8LW|4|This one is really good and Kids like it a lot.
B00A65YN8E|5|This was incredibly easy to install. I like the fact that you can adjust the water pressure of the sprayer. I keep mine right in the middle. Also like that there is a hook to hang the sprayer from. If you need a diaper sprayer, go with this one!
B000U3VZ88|5|It was everything I hoped for.<br />I wanted my Grandaughter to have a cozy blanket to play with her Junglebook toys.<br />We are all highly satisfied!
B009ZCFPUE|5|Loved it love the detail on it and it was amazing if your looking for a custom baby on board sticker then this it the guy to get it from
B00A9Q2XXM|5|very soft quality
B000JWSO9I|5|I got these as a gift initially and am very anti-pacifier BUT these serve a completely different purpose and are awesome. I've had several friends buy them after seeing my little lady go to town chomping and playing with hers. It's nice to be able to put linking rings on it and attach to her or something else she's playing with so it doesn't get lost. We even freeze ours to help with teething. Would definitely buy again.
B001GQ2SA2|5|I got this for my son. He Loves to focus in on the animals above him! They bightness usally doesnt even bother him at night. But when he fights himself falling asleep it keeps him up. I wish the mobile played different songs. Such as twinkle twinkle litte star & other ones like that.I love the fact it has a \\"remote\\" so you dont have to go all the way to the crib to restart it.  I am happy that I bought this one! All in all its a good product!
B0016LVEGQ|4|This cover is just what I was looking for, attractive and soft. I would have given it 5 stars, but I have not had it very long and I have no idea how durable it is. So far, so good!
B0041RRZ1U|5|This bag was a gift for a new mom, she had a diaper bag but it was less than optimum, stuff used to fall out all the time.  THis bag is bigger but not TOO big, PLUS it zippers on top keeping everything inside.  Also, changing pad zips into the side of the bag, a better design.  Very good product.
B006JV4HFS|5|I bought this high chair in preparation for a vacation.  It is easy to fold and pack, however you need to think about what you are packing with it if you plan to check it in a bag, it does add a few pounds.  It was easily attached to many tables and my one year old seemed to enjoy sitting in it.  As others commented, it is nice to have her right at the table.
B003I7KMAA|5|I LOVE this stroller!!!! I had gone through many strollers, and my four year old is just to big to be in a double stroller anymore. I was looking for a not to small, but not too big stroller that had a umbrella thing, and also had a place underneath. I love this so much because when you fold the back down you can fit a carseat of any size in it, even though i don't have it buckled in. This is a great stroller and I would highly recommend it!
B00OJN7L3I|4|It was very useful! Traveling for the first time with an infant could of been stessful but this travel bag made things easier!
B004JA1XB2|4|Was recommended by a friend and out of desperation I tried it.  So glad I did - instant relief.  My daughter doesn't fight it, she knows it will bring relief.
B00DUKR8D4|5|Nice product, I would tell my friends to buy this.  If the needed little bows for some reason.
B00I0M8QVU|5|We have tried all the major brands of pacifier and these are the only ones my 3 month can keep in her mouth. They are easy to clean and don't get water trapped in them like some others we have tried. A bonus is that all the designs are cute for girls including the blue ones!
B0002JETPQ|3|While this gate is extra wide which fits the 77\\" area I need to cover, it is not a very strong gate and we had to install a second one on top of it to keep the kids from climbing on it and bending it. It definitely is not a good gate for stronger, climbing toddlers which frankly is the reason I need gates!
B00AB5O6FY|5|These snaps are great for crafts & super easy to install. I've already bought more! They come in literally 100's of colors too.
B00S0MVB9E|1|Would have been great if the piece that the lock latches to was shorter or we had really thick cabinets.  Could not install and use them because of that. Waste of money
B000FHS97Y|5|After cutting my baby with regular nail clippers I found these and am completely satisfied.<br />I can trim her nails well without cutting her with ease. They are very sharp so you have to be very careful, but it is well worth the wait as they ship from Japan.
B00834D7G4|5|we had to upgrade our peg perego infant carrier seat and this was highly recommended by my sister in law.  we bought one to see whether it would fit in our chevy silverado and infiniti g35 (yup, fits both!).  our daughter loves sitting in it so much more that it's super spacious and comfy compared to her infant seat.  plus the cowmooflage print is just so fun!
B004IPLFNO|2|The mattress is not firm enough, at least for my daughter. My daughter is now 4-month old. At least last month, I have found the surface where she sleeps has already been depressed. I'm worried about her spines. This expensive mattress should not like this as some other cheaper ones. I really wanted a firm one at the beginning of seeking mattress for my baby.<br /><br />The size fits the crib.
B00MBJ1S54|4|Omg! so freaking cute, I just wish I came with two car seat holders. Its perfect for our soon to be born baby girl
B0084TZOP0|5|It is so nice not to have to use up batteries when we are traveling, I am just able to plug into the car and use my pump.  Great asscssorie to have!
B000066G5N|5|I was very excited when this product came out.  I am expecting my second child and my first is only 18 months.  This Stroller is very stylish.  The large wheels make it a breeze to manuver even though it is a good foot longer than the graco duoglider.  The seats are so soft and plush, which make it very comfortable.  The best part is the steerling wheel toy.  My older child plays loves it, and I have to fight him to get him out of the seat becasue he likes playing with it so much.  The one hand fold is very easy to use and I love that both front and back seats have trays with cup holders.  The amazing thing about this product is that when it is folded it is the same height as my graco metrolite single stroller (which is pretty small), it is fatter, but it still fits in my little suburu like a breeze.  I don't have a thing to complain about with this product.
B008RS8NRO|5|Love it an my daughter loves it
B001OC5UNK|1|Really weak at 50&#34; spread
B0039UULYS|5|Got this for my grandsons first birthday. His mother reports that it &#34;is the coolest thing&#34;.<br />She says loves it.
B008CKC6UM|3|Have to remember that these are not regular boas.  They are very skinny and would not work for a costume.
B00IBO5O6W|4|It's a little on the short side but over all we like it
B00BMJPEFY|5|This monitor works great! The night vision is clear and I love all the features on this monitor. I also love that you can attach another camera to it so you can have a camera in each kids room and then switch from camera to camera.
B00FCJVBE8|5|My husband got me these when we found out are daughter could not use disposable diapers they would give her chemical burns and so far I have not had but one blow out and that was because she was sick and had really bad poop and a lot at one time which I can say it held alot of that in just a little came out of one side but you know what I have had a lot more problems with throw away diapers leaking then I have had with these cloth diapers so I would say they get a 5 star and more cause they have been a life saver to us and her butt
B002901VZC|5|Worth every  penny!
B001UJXLP6|5|I bought these along with the \\"Pops\\".  The pops are very much like the classic toy, which are hard for toddlers to manipulate.  The snaps however, are truly a first building toy for baby.  I have thirteen-month-old boy/girl twins and they both enjoy their snaps.  They are easy for them to put together and pull apart.  They are also fun to put in and take out of the little bucket they come in.  My two even enjoy carrying the lid around. They don't make a noise when you're putting them together or pulling them apart, but they do make for a colorful, molecule-looking chain.  The individual pieces have little smiley faces on them although they are subtle.  I am here to order more - we're still working on sharing!
B00OJBAAXS|5|Was just as described. Bought it fir a friends baby shower.  Cant wait to give it to her.  Would recommend.
B000JPYEPS|4|A Great Pillow for Kids.  My two girls enjoyed these for thier long summer trip.  Good quality and very soft.  The only thing I wish it had was a strap so it wouldn't slip down if they moved thier head.
B003D3O8DQ|5|I purchased this when we thought we had lost our baby's floppy bunny.  The pair and a spare arrived promptly (we found the original one in the meantime but breathe easier knowing we have ample back-ups now). The box is so cute. This makes an ideal gift and is truly practical as any parent who has lost (or thought they lost) their child's precious security blanket will know. Would absolutely recommend.
B00HRZT35Y|1|Stank!
B000O7SBHI|3|I needed room for more diapers and some spit-up cloths.  This has room for the bare basics, and if you're traveling with more than one child or one that spits up or goes through a lot of diapers, then get a proper big bag and skip this.  Also, if you're using a wrap, it is difficult to impossible to carry the baby on you in a wrap AND this bag together.<br /><br />Other than that, the quality is excellent and it has a lot of neat small pockets.
B00BXE67VS|5|I wondered if it'd be worth the money.  The answer is YES!  Keeps stink contained very well, changing the bag is a cinch, and replacement bags are readily available.  This is a must purchase item for new parents!
B00839749A|5|These work great for my toddler daughter. We tried them at night after she was leaking through onto her sheets 3-4 times a week. After using them for almost two months, we haven't had one accident. We place them toward the back of the diaper.
B001G0BK2K|1|The item itself is true to the description. The only problem is that it leaks - ALOT! I'm using these cups for daycare only because I'm tired of cleaning up spills. Will not purchase this item again.
B005MQRBFE|5|I had been eying the Diono Monterey for a few months, but had reservations because some reviews had mentioned problems with the belt guide not allowing the seat belt to retract or becoming tangled. That very well may have been the case with older models, but that is not an issue with the one we have. Evidently the problem has been rectified. The seat belt glides easily, retracts, and never tangles. I love that I can easily adjust the height and width of the Monterey. Also,installation was a snap. The latches are convenient and easily adjusted. My guy looks comfortable and I know he is safe! I have no hesitations about recommending this booster. It's wonderful!
B002ZNKTIS|2|I just got these and put them up yesterday.  Today I went out and one of the lower suction cups no longer works.  I have requested a replacement product and will return the defective one and give it one more chance.  However, I don't think I can recommend these because theu are not &#34;wide&#34; enough for my rear windows (Nissan Rogue), and the top portion (where they roll into) keeps from placing near the sides of the window allowing some gaps.  I am hoping these will somewhat work, and will update review after a couple weeks.
B004VL2VRO|5|Baby gift. Works well.
B0052IERHM|5|Great bag...has kept our carseats nice and clean for all of our air travel.  The best part is that it has rollers for the airport or shoulder straps if you need to pick it up.<br /><br />Works also for b-safe carseats with other stuff in them.<br /><br />Highly recomended if you dont want your carseats to get dirty under the plane
B0088N4CUA|5|My son has this print on his car seat and I need a smaller bag than the one that the car seat came with and this matched and fit him perfect. He's only 3 months old but this bag is defiently something that can grow with him!!! I recommend
B007PK4M34|5|Just as described and works with my old old pump. Nice that t is a 2 pack<br />Would recommend to buy
B001L2SA3A|4|My daughter loves these pacifiers. We've tried Nuks, Soothies, Gumdrops, but these are the only pacis she doesn't spit out or lose. We received a pack of them as a gift and we bought 2 more after. The glow definitely doesn't last, but I wasn't expecting it to. The design is very cute too. Overall, very happy with these.
B000XE4EP0|4|We started potty training our 10 month old twins on this potty first and it served the purpose wonderfully well for both our infants.  They were fully trained on this one by 17 months because it was so comfortable for them to sit and their legs started reaching the floor by the time they were 1 year old.
B00EOML70W|1|I have been a loyal Born Free customer, using their bottles, warmer, and sterilizer. A few days ago, however, I was warming up one of the bottles in the warmer. When I took it out of the warmer, I found that the bottle was broken inside the warmer; the bottle part was separated from the main part as if it had been laser cut. Please see the pictures I posted. I cannot believe my eyes!!!
B00IR4F2A4|1|Cute, but suction cup doesn't stay suctioned so the toy constantly tips over and is useless.
B000UUBRYI|4|Love it, along with the travel system. The level on the base confirms that you have properly installed the car seat on a leveled surface. The car seat is very easy to insert and take out of the base.
B000GB0O0Y|5|This is the greatest item to have for getting your infant to drift off to sleep. It might not work every time, but I have great success with it with our 2 month old and so have many of my friends who told me about this awesome product. My son loves the soft transitions of soft colors. When a brighter color is shown it causes him to close his eyes, and since he's tired (but refusing to sleep!) it encourages him to keep those eyes closed and finally go to sleep. It was worth the first night this arrived! An absolute MUST HAVE!
B006PB2BJQ|4|Great price. Not super padded but daughter doesn't seem to mind. She loves the design.  Mom loves that the material is wipeable for easy clean up.
B000088KGZ|1|It died on the third use. It is not designed to easily change the battery and even then you'll be lucky if it doesn't give an error read. Seriously do not waste your money. We bought the vicks thermometer at the grocery store that has been perfect and cost less.
B000OQI8NG|5|She loves the tune!
B00007DWDZ|3|This pump is good if you have patience.  First, people complain about the suction not working: the plastic piece has to be put in the hole/slot just right for it to work.  You may have to rotate/turn it some to get a good suction. Second, people complain that this pump is painful: you have to make sure your nipple is lined up just right, or yes it does hurt.  Third, I have read that the pump holds liquid in the neck - this is caused by poor suction or clogged holes.  I only use my pump 2-3 times a week.  I used it more when I first brought my son home. At 3 weeks premature he had problems w/ latching on, and let me say that is more painful then this pump could ever be.  This product is not for people exclusively pumping - it wasn't designed for that. It will wear out sooner. I think it is good for people who are on a tight budget and using it 3-4 times a week, or for problems with poor latch on/ delayed milk.
B000TYEKXK|5|These aren't your run of the mill cheap cars, but they are really fun.  I gave them to my nephew for his 1st birthday and a few adults ended up racing them :)  Worth the price.
B006ZIST04|5|Amazing!!! My daughter loves it! Never been so happy with a car seat!
B00DUGECPU|5|Bought this for a birthday Gift!  What a hit!  Everyone loved it!
B0007D91BE|3|I just received the snuggle bub wrap. I ordered the small size for my 8 month old baby and immediately tried it out in our stroller with him inside. His feet were almost touching the bottom of the wrap! He is regarding his lenght in the 85th to 90th percentile. If you have a long baby spare yourself the hassle of returning and go straight for the larger size. Here on the amazon site it says size small is for up to 2 years but on the actual packaging it says up to 18 months. I also imagined the lambswool to be softer and the outside fabric attracts a lot of fuzz (petowners beware). Since the quality is not so nice I would recommend getting this item on sale (a real sale, not the 5-cents-of-the-original-prize kind of sale). It does look nice though. Will return mine for a larger size.
B000I5UZ1Q|1|I used to love this swing I may have even reviewed it once before my children loved it! I recently had a baby and was so excited to put her in the swing... Until the swing fell down with her inside it!!
B007S6SKCO|5|This item is really awesome, take to lunch with your favorite toppings to place on salad.  Many more ideas!  This is a great product!
B00PL1KVV6|1|Worst product ever. Within 30 seconds my twins figured out how to lift it up from the outer edge.
B004FQJ4XO|5|My baby's head was getting flat bc she only slept on the left side. The pillow keeps her head straight and the measurements prove her head is getting more rounded. We probably won't need to get her a helmet because of the intervention of the pillow use.
B00ISOE2J0|4|These are nice but expensive for what you get.
B00E82V6JU|5|Soft cotton cover--AND it is the designer brand of Prince George!!!
B00PQMRZG4|2|Not as comfy as other brands.  Water proof but not absorbent..  Liquid simply runs down them and onto pants.  Will not be buying again :(
B00AE7COAI|5|Shipped fast. Just as pictured love these for breastfeeding baby
B0018979KQ|3|I bought this as a present and also got it as a shower present.  I included it in my registry because of the feature that can be installed in the crib. I haven't used it yet, but the person I gave it as a present told me that the activity bar is easy for her baby to pull out.
B00674S1Y0|5|Sometimes I think my wife spends 3 hours of every day reading random websites.  One site in particular about potty training your infant grabbed her attention.  Apparently, it's possible to start potty training at a very early age which speeds up the point where the little rascal is self-sufficient in the potty department.  It saves a ton on diapers in the long run, too, which is a nice plus.  For those of you that want to research it, it's called &#34;elimination communication&#34;.<br /><br />The first time we held our little one over the toilet at 6 weeks old and made a 'sssssssss' sound in his ear, the tinkle flowed like....well, tinkle.  And again, the second time.  And the third time.  Clearly, there was something to this, so we invested in this little seat to help with the training process.  He did very well being held up on the seat, so we bought another so that we had one in our upstairs bathroom as well.<br /><br />As a sidenote, our little one (now 1 year old) has also been learning sign language.  So while he can't say the word potty yet, he definitely signs when he has to go (or sometimes when he's already gone).  We're guessing that in another 6 or so months he'll be fully (or almost) potty trained.  These seats have been a big help.<br /><br />From a functional perspective, there's a little &#34;bump&#34; at the front of the seat that acts as a deflector for little boys using the seat...but make no mistake, if they are leaning back at all when they start to pee they'll arc right over the shield.  There are also side handles, which our little one naturally grabbed onto when we first sat him on the seat.  It helped a lot early on with him staying upright and keeping his balance.  There's also a little air freshener at the back of the seat.  I never noticed a great smell, but I guess it never really smelled bad either so it probably is just doing it's job.<br /><br />My wife comes up with many crazy ideas...but I have to hand it to her, this one has worked out pretty well.  I'd definitely purchase this (twice) again, and I'm sure we'll use them as our family grows.
B00067AUP2|2|Thought this would work for a baby with acid reflux, but unless the infant stays in one position, it is useless.
B00ECE1TQO|5|Love this diaper! So cute and great for overnights!
B00643FRUA|1|It does not keep hear long and takes long to make it warm. Edge is sharp and hard to use without cover. So it feels even less warm. Not so practical.
B00012CHFI|4|I got this for my baby-shower. My hubby and I put it on our queen-sized bed to see how it would fit and it leaves you and your partner with very little room for sleeping. Other than that, it's of good quality, light weight, and will be nice to take along with us, especially when we go places where we don't want to tote around the pack-n-play.
B00IX6A058|5|So soft, and sewn eyes, which was really important. Unfortunately, it's SO cute that the two year old keeps taking it from his baby brother. Darn, guess I'll have to get another one!
B001G64O04|1|Our horse had a loose head so I contacted customer service. While they were super helpful, I was surprised to be informed that the rocking horse is not supposed to be a toy! It's just room decor, according to the Baby Aspen customer rep. That explains why the horse doesn't rock smoothly, but this is a big waste of money in my book. There was nothing on the Amazon site that says this.
B006WVC0X6|5|This is the fourth set of Charlie Banana that we buy and we love them all. They don't leak or stain. The diapers are extremely easy to use (we are first-time parents) and I will recommend them to anyone considering cloth.
B003VABEYM|5|Great price, small footprint. I really wish we'd gone ahead and bought these for all of the kids. Then, I'd be able to easily seat three across the back row of our Suburban! The highest rear-facing weight! Disregard your child's age. Keep him/her Rear Facing as long as possible. Don't risk the injury we suffered because, &#34;he's old enough.&#34;
B00028XJNA|3|They work, but size is too small
B003MUA4Q0|5|I'm wondering if they fixed the issue others were having with setting it up-- when I received it, it was out of the box and set up within about 2 minutes.  There are very clear directions printed on the bottom of the mattress-- it was honestly harder to get it out of the shipping box it came in than it was to set up the actual playard!  It seems sturdy and looks nice.  I like the slightly modern and clean looking design.  Also, when folded, it is much lighter and smaller than most other playards-- and when set up it seems a little larger and more sturdy than other playards--seems like good design to me!
B00PHMH4MS|5|It's small and flat and so easy to store but holds A LOT! Sometimes the zipper line on similar products goes straight across but this one follows the handle line so that it holds more. Thoroughly impressed. Exactly what I was looking for. We washed it and then put it in the freezer to to neutralize the wetsuit smell and it's totally scent free now.
B00INGNYXS|5|We've had 2 mirrors before this one is way better by far!! It's crystal clear and so solid and easy to install! I would recommend this to anyone!
B000CNOIQ2|5|Love how warm it keeps my daughter's wipes during the chilly season. My newborn's comfort was a huge reason for buying this item. It's nice to change her diaper without scaring her with a freezing wipe.
B002VBXY68|5|Great build, sound and performance quality. Better than Graco and it looks pretty nice as well.
B00BMVS2JM|5|These keychains totally surpassed what I had in mind that they would look like!  They were much bigger and very happy cute!!! They are a great item!!
B002L3T9ZG|5|My five month daughter LOVES this. And for the price its a great deal would buy again.
B00GGGD6YY|5|Works great. The design is a little far from the seat for a smaller child. But over all it's a must have.
B00OQSIQS0|5|Love it
B00DLTYKZS|5|Before I bought this 3 months ago, I was really concerned by the review that claimed that this product contained Polyurethane and was toxic for your baby. I got in touch with Baby Mushroom and the owner, Liat immediately responded, reassuring me that her product was approved by 'Consumer Product Safety Commission' and offered a detailed explanation about polyurethane, including: &#34;Polyurethane foam is used everywhere in your house! It is in your furnitures, in your bed mattress, in your memory foam bath mat, and in most changing pads and car seats! It is not true that the foam is toxic, as this review states. However, foam is highly flammable and thus has to be treated with flame retardants (once again, very much like all the household items I mentioned above). Some people prefer to avoid these flame retardants, but it is very hard to completely eliminate them from your life since the LAW requires flammable products to have them&#34;. I was reassured by this, bought the mat and am thrilled with it. So soft for baby, especially learning to crawl, stand and now even walk. Great purchase and excellent customer service by a small business Mom.
B004GCJMLG|5|Best invention ever.  These work great to keep my kids out of the cabinets.  Its easy to stick the magnet up somewhere that they can't reach.  A little tricky to install but the end result is well worth it.
B000P007FI|5|Thank you for an amazing Product. Looks great and we got the no holes installation.. all great! Highly recommended!
B0049ZOEA4|5|I bought this as a Add On to other gifts I was buying on Amazon.  It was very durable and expensive looking.<br />I highly recommend this item.
B008K3YX3Y|4|7 months later... creeks a bit and cushin has worn a bit but for the price (because there lots of other baby stuff to buy) it was a good deal. I still don't understand why this company calls it a Nursing Ottoman.
B001O9KIUI|5|This is an excellent potty. My daughter is  28 months and started potty training last week. It is the perfect height, as her feet fit nicely on the floor. It is also very sturdy and the seat is wide, so it does not leave any marks on my daughter. We also have a bjorn and it left a round red ring around her bottom.  I put a 4 gallon bag around the uring holder and it makes for a very really easy clean up.  I am purchasing a second one for the car.    I have looked at many other potties and would definitely recommend this one.
B000V3IIF0|5|The frog is so adorable and my daughter absolutely love it! Actually she is the one who wants to use it every time we go outside. The product is great for an active toddler.
B00125NZSQ|5|These are AMAZING for combating the AZ sun in an SUV parked outside. We bought one to try it out and ended up buying another for our second car seat. It keeps the car seat nice and cool and definitely gets the job done.<br /><br />Only a couple small complaints. One is that it is a bit difficult to get the car seat covers on while juggling a baby/diaper bag, but it gets easier as you learn which direction works best for your car seat. One reviewer had mentioned start from the side and pulling across, but we find it easier to start at the top and stretch it down. The other small complaint is that it really doesn't fold up. We basically pull it off and just shove it down below their feet. Not ideal, but still a great product for the price.<br /><br />We use it on a Radian and another bigger carseat and have had no issues with fit. Looks like it really is universal, as our car seats are some of the bigger ones on the market.
B005EJEWYW|5|I have been using Action Wipes for a number of years and they are fantastic.  The natural, scented oils are out-of- this world.  They clean up dirty faces, hands, and bodies lickity split and leave you feeling refreshed. They are strong, big and are a must have if you exercise and play outdoors.
B00IQ1JHJ0|5|SUPER CUTE
B000046S3W|4|This is a little clunky for me, but it's simple to use at least.
B00674S1Y0|4|Great seat, but really not necessary for potty training.
B001OC5UMQ|5|The measurements are off a little. I was expecting 6 inches and got 6 1/4 which then made it too big for my opening. I had to go down to 4 inches.
B00008439C|4|We have two of these.  We bought one when our older son was a baby.  He is now 2.5 and still uses it at nap- and bedtime.  We like it so much that we chose the same model when his little brother was born.  The sound has a nice quality.  Unlike many sound machines, I don't find it grating.  It is wonderful to have a plug-in model that can stay on throughout a nap or all night long.  The sound of the &#34;wind&#34; setting has become a sleep association for both boys and works wonders.<br /><br />My frustration with the product is that it does not remember settings, so each time the sound is turned on, the desired sound needs to be chosen, and the volume needs to be adjusted.  (The volume that comes on initially each time it is turned on, we find too soft to be effective; we turn it up to the not-very-loud maximum every time.)  While pressing these extra buttons for our preferred settings each time has become habit and does not bother me personally, it is difficult to explain to babysitters and other intermittent caregivers exactly what needs to happen every time the machine is turned on.  It would be much better if the machine could store a favorite setting or the last setting used, so that it doesn't require these steps every time.
B004QZBEDW|5|I already had one of these and had to get another for my oldest son. Very light weight and I don't have to bend down to pick it up. I love the color.
B00CXVO32U|5|These arrived amazingly fast!!!!! Used for the first time last night on 1yo and 2yo grandchildren for overnight leaks. They were soaking sleepers and bedding every night. These really seem to do the trick! Great product! Incredible service!
B001GMV90G|5|I love this footmuff! I use it on both my maclaren quest and bugaboo and it fits well. It's a bit bulky on a maclaren but I live in chicago so for the winter that's ok since warmth is so important. It's great quality and the inside material is so soft. I love that it's like a sleeping bag. I returned my bugaboo one because I didn't like the stiffness of the material (I do love the stroller though). This is well worth the money! You can also use it as a sleeping bag when your baby is older so it's very versatile
B007YQUSO6|5|Where was this when my older children were growing up. So much more useful then the booboo bunny which is also very cute but just does not cover as big an area as the Cool Gel N Cap. I wanted to see what size heads this would fit and I am glad to report it fits although a bit big from my youngest grand daughter who is one all the way up to my twelve year old although she would not let me take a picture of her with it on.<br /><br />Below you can see a picture of my 7 year old with it on and there was still lots of room left. I like that this is soft, can be used with the cold packs either on the head or held in a different area of the body. I like the strap that keeps the cap on and that you can change where you want the cool packs so that it will be able to rest on the sore spot.<br /><br />If you have young children with head or ear aches this is what you need. The paks are freezer and microwave safe so you can always keep one in the freezer and one at room temperature ready to heat up in a moments notice, to help you ease your children's pain.<br /><br />Being a mom of 6 children and running a child care for years this would have been a great item to have when we stated out being parents over 24 years ago. No one wants to see their child in pain. We all want to make them better right away. This is a great way to make them feel better while having your arms free for hugs and snuggling while the Cool Gel N Cap does all of the pain relieving.<br /><br />I received this as part of a promotion to facilitate a honest and unbiased review.
B000F1OT3I|5|This product is fantastic! When my three year old was a baby, I had found this changer kit at a goodwill, brand new. Boy did it do wonders for me! Now one of my co-workers is pregnant and I'm buying it for her. It conveniently folds up and you can store a small number of wipes and diapers and maybe a small tube of diaper rash cream in it. You can put it in your diaper bag and take it out when you're in public to change your baby. That way you're not lugging the diaper bag every where. I know that's a pain.
B00B1M2TUA|5|True to size.  Good quality cotton, not too thick or too thin.  Baby is very comfortable wearing it in the late fall.
B005VM63X0|1|I bought this because it was cheaper than other strollers and it went with my Graco car seat. If you really plan on putting 2 kids in here get ready for a work out. It was the worst experience going out with this with my toddler and newborn both in it, When I came to places like raised curbs or high curbs I could barely lift the thing an inch and had to take my toddler out before moving it again. I am not rich and now I have no choice but to use this because I cant afford to spend money on another one!
B00AQ7BIGW|3|It may have been the walk but some of the stickers have peeled up. They still look great though.
B009WDZ1Y6|5|I love it and it looks awesome in my son's crib with all the bright colors. Absolutely love the entire set!
B000TFGUC8|5|Wow - when we registered for this item, I never imagined my son would enjoy it so much!  As a premie, it took him until he was about 2 months old to really enjoy this. Before that, he was a little overwhelmed.  We did not turn on the musical sea attachment at first because we were a little worried about overstimulation.  After a few enjoyable \\"sessions\\" (about 5-10 minutes at a time), we attached the musical sea attachment and placed it on the \\"movement\\" setting.  Our son has to activate the music by grabbing and pulling on one of the hanging toys or kick the sea attachment directly.  He LOVED it and it really helps with cause and effect.  Now, at 5 months old, he still really enjoys his limited \\"alone time\\" playing with this playmat.  We have slowly introduced different ones of the hanging toys and it's nice because the Einstein holders will accomodate other toys hanging from the playmat as well.  This has become of the most used items we have in the house!  Nice job Baby Einstein!
B00NBDGS72|5|High quality placement! Highly recommended!
B000JWSO9I|5|My daughter loves this!  She will bite on this all day if I let her!  I just wish it could stay cold.
B00E6QIM40|4|Not good for a constantly drooling baby.
B008BMFL08|4|I bought this lamp for $9.99 at a major drugstore chain. It was a Christmas item on sale in January a few years ago. I had to take it apart and bend the metal contacts recently. Today I knocked it off the dresser accidentally with my broom handle and it shattered. I cried. I miss my little lamp.
B0009PAN7Q|5|My wife and I are both very happy with this product.  Very convinient.  Great design. We found it on Amazon and bought it because of the reviews and are glad we did.
B00Z52R76S|5|This product is amazing! I am 9 weeks pregnant today. We received this yesterday and we were pretty certain we heard baby's heart beat but we listened again today and I am absolutely 100% positive we heard it!! It has definitely given me peace of mind. I am a nurse, so a natural worrier, and of course kind of knew what to listen for but it was even hard for me! If you can't hear it right away don't worry! Keep looking and you will find it or it may just be a little early for you to hear. Hope this review helps someone! Buy this if you've been tHinking about it.
B006P05S2Y|3|Our car seat fit well in this and we can even put in our son's blanket resting inside the seat. It's great to use as a backpack. It's getting three stars because after only one flight, it has several holes near the base. Low quality.
B008PPQ22C|4|We have a 3 month old baby girl and this little mat does a nice job of providing her a tummy time space on our hardwood floors.  The body pillow is contoured nicely and fits underneath her chest. When she's into her tummy time, she will look to side to side and not fuss. If she's really feeling adventurous, she looks at the little mirror and rattle toys on the separate strapped down pillow.<br /><br />The mat, pillows and toys are made of durable materials and I wouldn't be afraid to put this through a washing machine if needed.<br /><br />Only improvement I would make it making it a couple inches longer, our baby's toes reach further than the end of the mat. But maybe we have a long baby?
B001PYQWXY|5|Pros:<br /><br />Easy to set up<br /><br />Adjustable<br /><br />Holes are the perfect size, we have yet to get anything stuck in them. Not for lack of trying, though...<br /><br />My son is twelve months old but the size of a 2 year old, and he runs up to the gate and pushes on it, it does NOT budge.<br /><br />Very good price.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />None yet.<br /><br />Overall I am impressed with this gate. I will buy it again in the future if the need arises. And for $20, you can't beat it! :D
B008OJ7C6Y|5|Yay! I can sleep at night again.
B006Z2BZAQ|5|Fits perfect in the pack & play
B007DYM2HU|5|My 5 month old loves this teether. It's easy for him to hold and it's by far his favorite thing to chew on.
B00HURFECK|5|For the price of this compared to others, I give it 5 stars. I've been using it for over a month now and it has been great. The only (sort of) negative comment I have is that I wish you could adjust the screen brightness - it's so bright it hurts my eyes if I do end up with a midnight wake-up call.
B004GCJMLG|4|My use is for geocaching. Work great!
B000HLXONW|2|I really liked this highchair for many reasons - neutral tone, wheels that lock, lightweight, a tray that detaches and fits into the dishwasher, etc.  However, the tray does not stay securely on the highchair, especially if you have it set at the farther settings away from the baby.  The tray has fallen off numerous times, scattering the food all over the floor.  This is a safety issue and it also creates a huge mess to clean up every time.  And now that my baby is older, she can push on the tray with her feet and make it fall off as well.  I had someone offer me their old highchair and I have happily begun to use that one.  It is just not worth the hassle to use this one anymore.
B00AXSQAEY|4|Loving this product
B002A9IYCA|4|I have to say this is a sturdy crib, and it has already made one major move during which it was taken apart and reassembled (all except the changing table piece), and it is still as sturdy as it was the first time we put it together. However, I am realizing that as my daughter gets heavier (we moved when she was 2 months old and around 10 lbs; the movers dropped it off around her 3rd month birthday, and she's grown so fast!) it gets harder to hoist her up onto the table or even over the railing since I am fairly short (5'1\\"). It would be so much nicer if I didn't need a stepping stool to change her diaper in order to save my aching back or if I could just lean over to lay her into the crib once she is asleep rather than first lifting her up to get her over the railing (it's a challenge to have her slumber through the process). I'd still recommend the crib, but only to my vertically gifted friends! It just didn't occur to this first-time mom that some cribs would be taller than others.
B000COYLTU|4|I am very glad that I chose to purchase this stroller    PROS  easy assembly  very sturdy stroller  nice baskets for storage and small pockets on back of shades  simple adjustable recline  fits through standard doorways    CONS  I cannot get this stroller to lock after opening it the first time.  Only one cup holder, but you can buy a buggy buddy handlebar organizer and attach to the back of one.  The straps require two hands for sure, but are very comfortable for the kids  Shade canopy doesn't really adjust much but provides good shade      Overall I am really happy with this product. My kids love that they can both see everything. I have a 3 year old and 1 year old and number 3 on the way so I think we will get a lot of use out of it. I can't wait to try it at Disneyland and Sea World next month.
B00C2SEFEK|5|He loves this
B007ZOK9DW|5|My baby loves it and will look at himself in the mirror and play with the toys for quite a while. I leave the music option off though, as I don't want to run the risk of him being awakened by the toy.
B00568MOOG|5|This change pad is very useful. I like the color( green crazy bubbles). I like quality of material and design.
B002G66L18|5|This worked as advertised.  I was able to anchor my 40&#34; TV down on the tv stand.  it really gives me a great peace of mind.
B0043RQJQU|5|Love it
B00C4ON746|4|Guess I missed the part of the product description that mentioned it being only 5 inches... it is VERY small. I think of piggy banks in like three sizes: small, medium and large... this would definitely be the small size. However, the design is very cute. I had intended on hand-writing a name on it, as this will be a gift - but the amount of graphics on the pig don't really allow room for anything else. I think I will just add a bow on top of the pig's head for a personal touch and to coordinate with other gift items.
B008PPQ7GI|5|I got these to entertain my cat that thinks she's a soccer player. She loves them and they are just large enough to stay out from under most of the furniture.
B005RCN9ZE|4|I just received this glider on Friday night.  I purchased it in the beige for our nursery.  The glider is beautiful.  It's a little stiff right now, but I'm sure it will loosen up once we sit in it a few times.  It looks great in the nursery.  I've actually never left a review for items, but since I am a soon-to-be mommy I've realized the importance of leaving reviews on items for others.  The only frustration that I had was with the delivery.  Home direct delivered the item.  They called me a total of approximately 15 times in a week.  They would call to change the delivery day and time and then 30 minutes later someone would call me back to confirm the old time.  It was the craziest experience.  Then on the night before the scheduled delivery they changed the time again so my plans had to be changed once AGAIN.  They were to deliver the chair between 12:30-4:30.  I received a call at 11 am asking if my chair had been delivered the night before.  At that point I almost lost it with these people (keep in mind I'm a VERY patient person). They called me again at 3 to tell me that they would deliver it by 5:30.  Finally, at 8:00 on Friday night they showed up.  It was very frustrating.  I completely understand that sometimes the unexpected happens, but this was just ridiculous.  So overall, the chair is good just beware that the delivery might be difficult.
B00BZAHJ0I|5|My baby loves the bear. The bears arms are just the right size for his little hands to grab. They snuggle every night.
B00QBODQ0K|4|A little thinner than I thought they would be<br /> Have not had them very long buy they seem nice. I am happy with my purchase
B00J4DS98O|5|This set is SO adorable!  It's perfect for a baby gift, the entire set is included in the adorable bag you just add a bow!  The quality is so amazing I absolutely love it!!
B0081C9C9E|5|These washcloths are absolutely wonderful! I use them to remove makeup off my face while I shower at night and I feel like I don't even need cleanser now. The material gets everything off and is so luxuriously soft on one side and the other side is soft yet exfoliating which is perfect for sensitive face skin (and ears!). I highly recommend for women and babies!
B001DVRTEA|5|Simple and pratical
B005GCZYSK|5|My son loves this book. It's small and light weight so I can toss it in the diaper bag and feel comfortable with him playing with it in the car.
B004AHMCKA|4|My daughter loves this on her high chair. It helps distract her when I get up to grab something and keeps her occupied.  The suction cups is a little weak.  I cleaned the surface and wet the cup before applying and it has still popped off a couple of times.  The best thing about this though is that it spins very well.  It will keep spinning and spinning which is great to keep my daughters attention.  I saw one review mention that their childs finger got stuck in the spinning wheel - I have not had that problem and don't see how it could be an issue so I wouldn't let that sway you.  All in all, I like this.
B004LC77JK|5|love the sheet was everything i wanted and i would do business with again sell was fast and prompt on getting the item to me
B005NJ2EMK|5|My son absolutely loves his new comforter!  Nice and bright!  Super soft, and plenty warm for him!  Great buy for his fourth birthday!
B00AQTWBCU|4|My son played with this for a few weeks and then got sick of it.  It was good while it lasted - made him happy to be in the stroller while we ate brunch or took long walks.
B00OIGTRKG|2|Small and hard.  Hurts more than it helps.
B00G2NGXVO|5|I have two of these in two different cars.  This mirror works exactly as it should...adequate straps to adjust and stays in place.<br />Very happy with this product.
B004J4VXW2|1|Thought these cups would be great seeing the ziplock brand... WRONG!! These are by far the worst spy cups I have ever purchased! The lids don't screw on properly and leak EVERYWHERE!! Hate them will NEVER EVER BUY THESE AGAIN AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE! Im so furious with the lack of quality they are going right in the trash! Would rate less than one star if I could
B00925WLEM|4|These are my favorite bibs. Made with softest muslin and looks very pretty. Now a bit faded after a few washes and I wish it was a little thicker to absorb more. My li'l one drools a lot and I need to change it very quickly.<br />They are big so I couldn't use them on my newborn but fits a 3-month plus very well. Very nicely made with great finish.
B000NVZ8BW|5|It's a great product, sturdy and yet compact enough to carry around. My daughter loves this potty and this says it all... It's comfortable to use, and of course it doesn't compare with all the germy public toilets :)Everyone who saw it admired it, and I recommended it to all my friends with toddlers. we've had it for almost 3 months, and we usually keep it in the car. However, if you have to carry it around, no one will be the wisest because of the nice, sporty bag it comes with - only downside - bag could have some bigger pockets for whatever you may need to carry around (like spare clothes...)  Oh, and I don't know why people would pay $[...] for the colored one, when the gray is only $[...]...
B003XMWF28|5|Great Product!
B00RM2UN10|5|These are so cool! Excellent way to steam bottles and pacifiers while traveling:)
B00ARTRNY0|4|I bought these to embellish them and turn them into burp cloths for my sister (having her first baby). I prewashed to account for shrinkage, and it was fine. The second wash I combined these colored diapers with the white ones. I noticed pilling after they came out of the dryer. I do believe it wouldn't have been an issue if I hadn't washed the colors with the whites. So just a heads up on that. The burp clothes turned out great, and I would recommend these to a friend. No experience using them as cloth diapers. I prefer hand made cloth diapers.
B008BKV2OO|5|My daughter accepted the Avent Natural bottle...it was the second type of bottle we tried. I love that it is easy to put together & clean, and that it is compatable with the Avent manual breast pump. Last awesome thing: in several months, I can get spouts and handles to make them into sippy cups. Less clutter + multitasking items = happy mama!!
B0016KYMMU|5|Works for every toilet I have put it on. Especially for elongated toilets (most public toilets).<br />I've use it on top of the toilet most of the time and as a stand along while at the park, back of the car and very much anywhere.<br />Plastic shopping bags works perfectly and I sometimes add a paper towel to absorb the pee.<br /><br />Best purchase ever.
B0036BZVU4|4|I have a second car seat that we use on a regular basis, however this one makes a perfect addition! very sturdy and also very dainty and pretty design!
B006NTY1HU|5|This works great for small children. No hidden surprises or extra kits you have to buy. It is light weight so, of course, larger children can push it around/ tip it but that is the flip side of portability. We have mats and blankets that keep it held in place and that works great.
B00CXH2M2W|5|Will buy these over and over and over again! Great Price!
B000U5WE2M|2|This is a $250 bedding set to be used for a very short duration of a child's life.  It is not a crib!  Although it does cost more than most cribs.  We are big Stokke fans. But I would recommend skipping the bassinet size and going one size up.  I think even the people at Stokke would agree.  One person I spoke to there did.  (Also, there is not a conversion kit to convert the larger Stokke size crib to the smaller bassinet.  Since some people do reuse their cribs, this makes the whole thing unworkable.)
B005JCPKVI|5|This system was everything I hoped for, not big and bulky very lightweight and easy to use. I also purchased the B Ready bassinet and it works well with the stroller.
B000088KGZ|2|Not a trustworthy read.  Can never tell if he has a fever or not based on this thermometer.
B001H0GEYI|5|This is a terrific booster.  Large, 2-compartment cup holders on each side, LED reading lights on both sides and a comfortable arm rests (not hard, molded plastic).  My 5-year old loves this booster!
B002UXQRLG|5|Love this Sippy  My 9 months baby boy can easily finish his drinks with this cup because he loves it.    I was so delighted when I got the Blue one for him.  I was worried that I might get a pink one or some other color for girls.  Anyway, the cup is great!  The size is just right for small kids.  Love the design of those handles.  Very easy to grab and they are adjustable so the spout is always in the right position.  I also love the spill proof design. I don't need to worry about it when my baby puts it upside down or tosses it around.
B004EFC6MC|2|im not sure this necklace is legit.  My son has teethed with it and hasnt had much calm from it, like my other son had with his dark amber necklace... just to be safe check around.
B00RDT3UYO|1|I've had this monitor for 3 years.  It's survived well and batteries lasted well but I can't handle the beeping.  Theres 2 walls between the parent unit and little ones.  Everytime someone walks anywhere in the house it starts beeping (lost signal beeping).  The beeping is a constant volume too, it doesn't matter how high the volume is on the speaker.  The other night I was rocking my new little one and everytime I rocked back I heard BEEPBEEP from the other room.  It's not like I'm standing in the path.  We've had them set up directly across the house from each other, with only 2 doorways between them.  They still beep ALL THE TIME.  Then I'll barely turn the receiver and it quits.  Then it gets possessed again randomly.  Finally breaking down and getting a different one.  Can't wait to pull an office space on this junk!
B004HK3WOU|5|Used recently for only two bottles and some pacifiers to put in my hospital go bag. Very easy to use, takes only 7 ounces of water in the bottom and will remain sterile for 24 hrs if you don't open. I prewashed the items in hot water with palmolive baby dish soap and then rinsed and then put in the sterilizer.  I put the items in a bagging after they were dry and put them in a labor go bag.<br />I got this on sale and it was super cheap pricing but it is worth the full price, Holds a lot but stillv ery easy to use for only a couple things.
B00Q170H9A|5|These are so soft - my son loves them!
B00B2NLDDC|5|I just love my Boba wrap!  I bought it when my second daughter was just a few days old.  I could see that I was not going to have my hands free to take care of my 2 year old AND my newborn.  My baby loved being wrapped up close to me and napped very frequently in it.  The bouncing of me walking around put her right out!  I could make dinner, pick up the house, play with my other daughter, all while wearing the baby.  As she has gotten older, we continue to use it.  I put her in it for walks outside when she was a few months old.  I wore her grocery shopping so my other daughter could ride in the seat of the cart.  Now she is 11 months and I just had her in it to vacuum the whole house!  It has been one of the BEST baby purchases!
B00BLVQIMG|5|just bought this for our older child's diapers.  it really works and keeps the smells contained.  downside is having to purchase the &#34;bag&#34; system, but decently priced and manageable
B000VJJF60|5|We've been using the mattress for about 8 months, and it is working great.  My son sleeps fine on the firmest side, and the mattress has held up well to some minor &#34;incidents&#34; of the usual baby kind. I'm a small person, so the light weight is a lifesaver during sheet changes. I also had a couple of questions before buying, and the manufacturer answered all of them quickly and politely when I emailed them.  So I can recommend both the product and the customer service.
B0030UUBMO|3|Any portable crib has a tough board accross the bottom.  When the Dream on Me mattress was added I felt that while it did soften it a bit, it was still stiff.  Because it is only 3\\" there is not much room for movement.  My son doesn't even really notice the difference when I put him in his crib with or without the mattress.  I think more than anything it gives me a peace of mind that his crib isn't sooo hard, even if he doesn't notice!
B000BN63KM|5|Love this!!!!
B00AB27DQQ|5|Love elephants
B0000BX8LV|5|Love these cups!  They can be used over and over and they don't leak (only a teeny bit when my son leaves them lay on their side for a long time...ugh!)  I wanted to get my kids off traditional sippy cups due to them impairing language development, and these cups fit the bill!
B002UOC35Y|2|Best for transitioning from bottle TO sippy cup.<br /><br />The spout wears out fast once baby has teeth.<br /><br />Thankfully only four cups were purchased.
B003EGEJOK|4|I just purchased this pack N play for my grandson, he has not used it yet but I just wanted to say it is very sturdy and easy to put together. I had to look at the book because I couldn't figure out how to put the mobile together but then after I read it, it was so simple. Very easy to take down everything fits in the matress and goes in the bag. Once my grandson sleeps in it I will update my rating.
B002OFUJ2S|5|I bought this for my daughters first birthday over a year ago and she still loves it. It has swiveling wheels that have made it very easy for her to navigate around, and I like that it still works fairly well on carpet.<br /><br />And it's SO cute, I love when I can find toys that aren't cheesy that look nice in my home AND my kids love them.<br /><br />It's very durable and great quality and if you're smarter than me, you'll figure out much sooner to tuck the ears in front of the handle, not behind. The stock photo shows them pushed back and they get in the way, and it wasn't until I saw someone's Instagram that I realized I had it all wrong!<br /><br />This is a super gift for a toddler and it's one of those well-made, classic toys you can keep forever.
B000LXQVA4|5|I give this five stars because it's the only jumper that could keep my son occupied. Not only was it fairly easy for him to jump in, it has bright colors, lots of fun toys and so easy to assemble. I would highly recommend this jumper to anyone!
B000LSL5ZK|4|I like the size of the actual spoon.  It fits the perfect amount of food for my little 7 month old.  The handle feels great too.  I would like it however, to be more like the Playtex spoon handles.  I always wind up getting food on my baby's nose because it doesn't have a nice curve to the handle.  Overall great value and holds up great in the dishwasher.
B005QU55EA|5|These, IMO, are the BEST safety locks available on the market. We didn't have to attach/drill/etc anything to our cabinets, which we appreciated. Child cann't figure out how to open and they withstand the child trying! Easy for anyone to use. Will only work if you have knobs or handles on cabinets.
B002WN2ASI|5|Nice product.
B000CS9TGG|5|Someone with a teething baby came up with this idea! This is so much better than just tucking a cloth in. Now our son can drool and chew as much as he likes, and we can just pop the bib in the wash. Please note that the bibs come in sets of 2!
B004DC9TAS|5|Absolutely love it! All terrain, easy to maneuver, love the shocks and brake system. Nice storage bin underneath. My little boy loves going for walks in it. It is the only stroller my husband and I bought for our 1st child and we won't be buying another!
B00DWZJGP0|4|it rides  nice but the decals keep coming off
B00PF8ACW8|5|These came right on time. good product.
B00004DS9S|5|This tub sits on our bathroom counter easily, cleans well, and drains in a snap. The &quot;sling&quot; supported my son very well when he was a small infant, and now he sits up in the tub without the sling. It was a little difficult to assemble, but you only have to do it once. Also, when a friend visited with her baby, who is a little chubby, he did not fit well in the sling, and she had to keep her hand on him the whole time. With a smaller baby, I can use my hands to wash him while he rests in the sling.
B000O7UL1W|5|very soft and a great price.  must have purchased at least  of them.  between switching out the sheet for my boys and leaving a set for school.  it's a perfect price and super soft
B00BH0QGDM|5|Love it. Clean, neat and easy to use. Folding it is a bit tricky. It's easiest folding it in third flipping it back and forth and then inserting in the pocket.
B009IWHJVE|2|We got this as our primary chair since we dont have room for any more furniture. It worked fine for about 3 months. Once baby got fidgety, the plastic clip that holds the top of the chair to the bottom half broke. Now whenever she squirms, the top half (where the harness is attached) comes out. It is completely useless. If you just use it when you travel once every month or so, it might work for you.
B0042D69WY|5|Our little son has loved this swing since day 1 of his arrival at home. He has been taking his day naps here and can sleep up to 3-3.5hr stretches in here. He is now 3 months old and it is still his favorite sleep spot, plus the mobile and the music provide hours of entertainment to him. The mobile toys can easily be replaced with vibrant colored versions to intrigue a newborn. The cradle really hugs your baby at all angles and the inside fabric is soft and easy to wash. I highly recommend this product!!! I wish it could be utilized further than 25lbs.
B00208KJ0G|5|Great quality, It solve my problem
B00UMJMGPG|5|I was given this product free for review, and was really impressed.  It is super cushy and molds well. I like that it came with corner guards to give it a clean, finished look.  The double sided tape provided, secured it well.  It arrived quickly and I love the packaging. I would definitely recommend this product and wish I'd have found it sooner.
B00295MQLU|5|Easily adjustable for size which is perfect for a changing body after baby. I don't find the straps useful at all. This is just a bra that I'd use while pumping but not as a regular bra. The color pink is really cute
B00BWRPB7M|5|excelente
B002RON446|2|The brown color of this changing pad is very dull and the fabric is super stiff and uncomfortable even after I washed it with fabric softener.
B00O8RRJ7S|5|My girls Love it!!!
B00A7Z026A|5|This worked great for us for 4-day road trip & back. Most of the other options out there wouldn't fit my seat, much less let me keep the mirror in place so we can see what's going on with our rear-facing toddler. This let me keep the mirror in place and still find a way to fit so baby could watch.<br /><br />If I had any suggestion for improvement, it would be a little more length on the straps for flexibility, but I realize that might cause a problem with stability or require a 3rd contact point.
B005CQAX3G|5|This is the best invention yet.  Slow enough so baby can be in it all night long.  My newborn was awake at night and slept during the day.  This kept her quiet and helped her sleep meaning I got some sleep too.  I love this thing so much.  Right by the bed. I can lean over and stick in the pacifier when it falls out, sometimes often.  Rocks her to sleep easily and calms her when she wants to stay awake.  So much better than a co-sleeper or any of the other swings which don't allow easy access or rock too fast.  Love that it does not run on batteries as we would be constantly replacing them since we run it all night long.  Stylish and comfortable for baby.
B00451B0X6|4|I purchased this for my granddaughter's baptism. The handprint came out a little lighter than I wanted, but if I would've had to help with the handprint it would've turned out darker. All in all I love this gift!
B00DJBU7FU|4|I returned this item because the spoons were not the size I thought they were. I ordered them for my grandchildren, ages 5, 3, 2, and 9 months, to use when visiting. However, both items arrived on time and in great condition. Bowls were exactly what I need so I was disappointed the spoons didn't work out. Found bowls elsewhere without the spoons as part of a set!
B00AR2BN4I|5|This is a good one and fits in all call seats. I recommend this product and if I have to buy one more I will go for it.
B001Q1CHQC|5|This is so cute!  I love it and the grandchildren love it.  It is colorful and easy for the children to press the controls to make the music and sounds.  Definitely recommend this.
B003TOJA1O|5|So, I do need to begin with some caveats about this seat: 1) It is designed for children ages 3 and up to start with.  My daughter is not quite 3.  However, she EXCEEDS all of the weight and height requirements by a long shot, and after reviewing it with a car seat safety specialist and our pediatrician, we were given the thumbs up.  2) Think of it as an adapter to make a regular lap/shoulder belt fit a child properly.  IT does not lock in or anchor to the car. It makes sure that the lap belt sits on the child's thighs, that the shoulder belt fits properly across the chest and not against the neck or head.  That being said, my daughter absolutely loves it, and so far we have been very pleased.<br /><br />We have purchased Combi infant car seats before, and have been pleased with the quality, the design, the colors, and the compact package.  The Combi Coccoro was the only infant carseat we could place in my wife's VW Beetle, and still allow legroom for adults in the front (we're both 5'11\\").  Our daughter is now 40 lbs and 38\\" tall, and had outgrown her infant seat, so it was time to upgrade.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Going back to the original caveats: I would not recommend this carseat for immature children.  It may not work for you.  Because you don't have the 5-Point harness, unless your child will obediently keep the shoulder strap in place, then it may not work for you and your child.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Pretty much everything.  It is slim, lightweight, easy to get in and out, easy to buckle, it stays wonderfully cool to the touch (no sweaty pants after three hour car rides), it is very high quality and nothing on it feels \\"cheap\\" (I have felt that way about all Combi products).  Added plus - if you have economical cars (like we do), it fits so much better.  We can easily move it from one car to another, and within seconds adapt it so it fits properly for grandma and grandpa's car.<br /><br />We originally purchase the Graco Nautilus, and it's just night and day.  The Nautilus is fine, but it's bulky, expensive, and the buckles are an absolute PAIN.  Getting it in and out was impossible, so it was basically anchored in.  I can get two Combi Kobuks for less than the price of the Nautilus.  It got sent back to Target.  It does have a tether, 5-point harness, etc. - which exceeds above and beyond the requirements for kids that age.  I can understand this is a deeply divided topic, and I don't want to come up like I am willing to compromise safety.  But, my child was ultimately uncomfortable in the Nautilus, didn't want to sit in it, and the buckle sat so close back, it rammed right into her crotch and made her unhappy to the point of kicking, crying and screaming.  It has some design flaws we just could not get past.<br /><br />If you have anxieties about your carseat needing the 5-point harness, tether, etc. - and your kid needs to be anchored in, the Kobuk is probably not for you.<br /><br />Just to share how adorable my daughter is - after it arrived, she was very excited about opening the box, and after we installed it and test drove it around, she was very happy with it. The next day, she went with my wife to the store and announced that \\"I LOVE my big car seat, daddy made it from a box.\\"The Nautilus is fine, but it's bulky, expensive, and the buckles are an absolute PAIN.

B000067K0L|5|Echo what everyone said that was positive -- very fun!  Soooo many different ways our lil one uses this that it can entertain for quite awhile.  We started her on it right away and still at 7 months she's crawling through it (months 2-6 were peak).  The hanging toys are really neat and like everyone has said you can take them along for more fun elsewhere.  Folds flat under our couch when not in use easily and have had no problems cleaning up baby puke with a wipe.
B00081MJUK|5|Fits perfectly into the back window! And keeps the sun out of my daughter's face :) it also sticks very well, I havent had an issue with it!!
B000YDDF6O|5|All it does it play classical music and flash blinking lights for 30 seconds at a time, but it's been of the my kids' top 5 favorite toys for going on 3 years. It manages to be soothing, stimulating, and hypnotically fascinating all at once.
B00KU112J2|5|Satisfied with purchase.  We will see how baby likes them when she arrives.
B008HRJKEU|1|My son is one and a half and is way too big for this.  I don't know what kid this is designed for, but there's no way my son could use it.  The splash guard in the front might as well not even be there, because it's useless and doesn't even come close to guarding the right area.  There are better options out there.  Stay away from this one.
B0033UWT8A|5|I do 90% of my grocery shopping on foot, and these hooks are great on my stroller to get the groceries home.  The can hold a lot of weight and are eary to adjust with the Velcro straps.  I also hang my water bottle off of these hooks when using my jogging stroller, as it does not fit in the cup holder.
B00HCSYQVM|2|I got this pillow as a gift and didn't think twice about comparing it to the Boppy nursing pillow. I brought it to the hospital with me to help out with nursing. Little did I know, I ended up having a C-Section. This pillow was hard and pinched my mid-section when I tried to nurse and use it to prop my baby up with. My husband bought me a Boppy pillow to use instead and this pillow has been in the closet ever since. The Boppy was soft and didn't pinch me, and it gave the baby plenty enough support. I don't breastfeed without my Boppy in my lap.<br /><br />I do plan on using the Mombo later on for tummy time with my infant, but the Boppy is perfectly capable of helping with that as well.
B00AWMS99U|5|These are FANTASTIC bibs for baby-led weaning, or any munchkin really. Keeps clothes clean, the long sleeves are great, love the over-the-head function and stretchy neck. I use a more water resistant wipeable type of bib with the same type of neck from an Etsy seller during summer, but any other time of year these are the go-to for coverage. These are now a baby shower first choice gift, worth every penny.
B00JQ2VZXE|1|This product took forever to be shipped, the quality was horrible AND it's hot pink not at all the color I was expecting. So disappointed
B005C9ODQ6|4|I have four different carriers and this is my second favorite. The Infantino Tie Wrap is quite comfortable and it allows the baby to face forward or towards you and can be worn on your back, but it doesn't have the head support like the Ergo Baby and also takes a little more effort to put on and to put baby into it. My other carriers are the [[ASIN:B004VB0GRG Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Slate]], the [[ASIN:B0010PW3A4 Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining]] and the [[ASIN:B0009JOSNM BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton]]. The Moby is very comfortable and excellent for the first 2 months of birth since baby can snuggle right in there with you and you can get skin to skin contact. BUT the Moby wrap has so much fabric and takes a while to put on and take off. The Baby Bjorn is the easiest to get baby in and out, but it is the least comfortable on my shoulders. I can barely last 30 minutes with a 15 pounder. The Ergo carrier provides the most comfortable hold for the parent which enables me to carry around my little one longer than the other carriers. It's easy to put on and take off and equally easy for my little one to get in and out. I love that there's a head cover for shade and sleeping babies. You can use this carrier on your back too. the Ergo is also a favorite for dad.<br /><br />If you want a more comprehensive review on baby carriers, visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com. Look under baby gear essentials and you'll find a guide on strollers, cribs, diaper disposals, and baby carriers. It's also got information on what to expect at the hospital for delivery, the recovery process, and how to get sleep the first few months (sleep deprivation sucks).
B002GD4H6M|2|I registered for this and returned it immediately. Kind of bulky, hard to travel with and I was concerned about the hinges with little fingers as a couple of previous reviewers thankfully posted. The rotating seat seemed like a good idea initially, but isn't the point of sitting your kids at the table to have them participate in the family meal? Not only is the fast table chair better designed, it's also less expensive. Dont waste your time!
B000RIAWSA|4|This is a great product as long as you remember you are still giving them to a 3 foot con-artist/escape artist who get out of and make a mess out of anything. The cup as a whole is well designed for travel snacking and around the house snacks. The slotted top is sturdy enough that my 15 month old can get his hand in but not a fist full of snacks out. However, if you blindly throw a handful of crackers with some broken bits and small crumbs in there, any toddler quickly figures out how to use the cup as a shaker to sprinkle crumbs all over the house. These are great to use in stores to keep a fussy kid busy with a few snacks while you finish up the shopping. All in all my kid loves it, however, as I stated up front, don't think that any of these snack cups are going to provide a \\"mess free\\" experience.... just a reduced mess one.
B002GAY07Q|5|Love these! They stain easy but eh, they're just baby spoons! great depth and hold a lot of purees for my 8 month old.
B0071DOTGK|5|Best diaper bag ever. I still using as my purse and my youngest child is now 4.
B003ZR2KL2|5|I bought this doll for my little niece's baptism. The doll is well done and she says a prayer in spanish, since my niece understands a little spanish this was a perfect gift.
B004QXZD68|5|I won't re-hash everything that's been said in other reviews... here are our salient points:<br /><br />Inline, compact, yet spacious for our 3 year old and 7 month old.<br /><br />Before our youngest was able to sit upright, we solved the lying flat problem with a small wedge pillow under the carry cot (Dex pregancy pillow for 10$, also on amazon, worked GREAT: [[ASIN:B000056JC1 DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP 01]]<br /><br />Both kids love riding in both seats, and my long-legged 3 year old doesn't mind the little metal step at all.<br /><br />Very spacious and easy to reach basket.<br /><br />Turns on a dime despite its weight.<br /><br />My only complaint is when both kids are in it there's no room for recline, but it's a compromise we're willing to make for all the above positive points... they both manage to sleep in it anyway!<br /><br />We literally looked at all the other doubles out there, and this one won hands down, and after 6 months we are still very happy with it.
B004SP3NNE|5|We love all of Aden and Anais.  This is super helpful due to it's dual use.  And super cute too.  Soft and stylish.

B00AA6LQKM|4|I like these - they store well in my weird freezer. What I don't like is that the trays are a little bit fragile and I actually broke the corner off one of them, trying to get a pop out. Sometimes I have to run hot water over one of the pops to remove it, but that's not a huge complaint. To &#34;solve&#34; the problem of stuff being too far down in the handle to eat, I just don't fill the resevoir all the way up. No waste! Easy peasy. I would probably buy these again despite the breakage. My son really likes these and has an easy time with them.
B0015LPPZ8|3|This was more of a purchase for me. I thought my son would really enjoy this and he really showed no interest.
B004M14JQO|5|Works perfectly well with a twelve-year-old Graco infant seat one of my friends gave me. Fits snug, safe and secure. Extremely easy to install. It did not work with a three-year-old Baby Trend infant seat we have. The food tray is very convenient, and my daughter likes it.
B00M6N5LYE|5|My 7 month old loves it. Its been easy to clean so far (after a month of use).
B000FTD1PM|5|I gave this to my friend as a shower gift for a couple of reasons, besides being beautiful and well made, it gives her the option of moving it from room to room since it has wheels. This will give her more freedom and less worry, especially as a new mom being concerned she can have the baby where ever she goes in the house. Also when the baby gets big she can put his toys in it or blankets since it is very much a beautiful piece of furniture.
B00Z7109I0|5|I have a 2009 honda fit. The outer most vents are round and fit the round adapter perfectly. The vent itself is also very strong and i am 100% confident the vent will not break. (Though the square adapter would not fit my middle most vents and i know theyd break if i even tried.) The noggle securely attaches to the round vent so the air pressure is great for my rearfacing little one too. I did get a 6ft noggle which is long enough for my little car but if i got the 8ft one my son could have more to hold... i currently have it velcroed to the handle on the ceiling so the air falls down on him. Love this! No more sweaty baby.
B006W79L2S|1|This cup is round, and rolls away from my baby. It also has no handles, making it hard to hold onto.
B001OC5UNK|1|Flimsy
B00021D1GC|5|This gentle yet effective product works great for cleaning baby's face and bottom in between baths. I also use it when he dribbles milk into the folds of his neck to prevent irritation. Great great product. Smell is not very chemical or invasive either...smells clean.
B0034ISZDY|5|This product is great!  I was using a sports bra with holes cut out for the nipples, but that meant I had to undress (or at lest take off my shirt) ever time I went to pump. Pumping took longer and I had super frizzy hair.  This product enabled me to quickly get set up for pumping.  Make sure you order a size down-you want the bra to be snug.  However, I ordered a large (thank goodness I didn't order an XL...I am a 40DD) and it is a bit big, and it still works just fine.  It is very comfortable, and the fabric is cute.  My only beef?  Like another reviewer said, it would be nice if this had velcro on the front instead of a row of snaps, and my glass bottles are too heavy to be held up by this bra.  However, glass bottles seemed to be too heavy for other hands-free options that I used, so not sure what can be done.
B001P22Z2I|4|This crib is gorgeous. It is distressed black, not just black. When it arrived it had two parts that were damaged in shipping, but we called the manufacturer and got new parts in 3 days. Great customer service, I would buy from them again.
B000056JKR|2|This changing table went into the trash after my baby @ 8 months crawled onto the lower shelf.  The shelf gave way.  The shelf had previously bowed with weight over 10 lbs(baskets w/supplies and diapers).  So, you basically can't store anything on the shelves! <br /> Most children aren't potty trained until 2 1/2...buy a good quality changing table.  This product is not of good quality.<br />FYI-Top and frame are very stable.
B00CY1LNYU|5|work well, stay on easily.
B0081U2O3W|5|Love the bigger size,they work great for my daughter
B000YFR9TG|5|This crib skirt is rather true to color, but I would say that it is a bit more pastel in real life.  I washed this crib skirt twice before putting it on the crib, and at first I thought that I would need to iron the skirt because it was really wrinkly (due to be 100% cotton.)  However, I thought I would just see what it looked like on the crib before I ironed it.  After it was on the crib, I decided that it didn't need to be ironed.  It didn't look wrinkly at all.  The ironing part is totally up to you, though.  I just thought I'd mention that it's not necessary.  Perfect, simple crib sheet!
B007GRCJ72|5|It's a typical blanket with plush head attached.<br />But the Minnie Mouse head is really cute, and the blanket is super soft.<br />Plus the price was right.<br />Great choice if you just need a little something for a baby shower.
B007AXGR1G|5|We bought a 13 gallon garbage can with a lip to use as our diaper pail and this fits perfectly! The elastic top clings to the inner rim so that it never falls in and the elastic isn't too bulky so the lid that has a clasp in the front stays closed. We bought another one with a drawstring that has a plastic end to close the bag but the lid of the garbage can never stays closed. Really, there is no need to have the bag close because we take the load from the pail and put it right into the washing machine.<br /><br />This has also been fully waterproof. No leaks for us. Also no residual smell at all and we have been using it for 6 weeks now. Would highly recommend it, especially for the price.
B000E9T8GO|5|I bought this to keep my puppy on our first floor and they work very well. Easy to set up and I liked that it includes the extensions which I needed. Only downside is the opening is pretty small, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me. They also stay put and are easy to open/close. Would recommend these gates.
B004K6LMTS|5|This is perfect for a toddler transitioning to a &#34;grown up&#34; cup. My daughter had no problem using it right away. It is high quality material and the best part is that it is unbreakable! Green Sprouts never fails to put out excellent products.
B000IDSLOG|5|My baby likes Sophie the giraffe. It's very soft, filled with air, and it squeaks. Those were things I didn't realize when I ordered it. So I was surprised, but she likes it a lot! It's easy to hold and chew on. I love that it's safe and healthy.
B00IB7DPN8|5|Super fast set up!  Clear Picture!  Amazing quality!<br />This Motorola product has surpassed my expectations.  It is so easy to use.  It essentially took me less than 5 minutes to set it up.  I'm excited about the outdoor monitor also and have verified it works as well as the indoor, but I will ask one of the guys in the house to get it set up.  The picture is very clear and the sound is pretty good.  We are very excited about the uses for the product and the convenience.  This product has given privacy back to my elderly relative. I no longer have to enter her room to check on her when I haven't seen her for awhile.  I can just flip on the switch and verify that she is asleep.  The camera faces directly on her pillow, and it has taken a lot of anxious moments away.  She and I are both happy with the product and the convenience and privacy that it allows.
B0009PAN7Q|5|I have a little boy and this was perfect for him. It's very secure, doesn't slip around the toliet seat, which could result in a very painful pinch for a little boy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this seat, and I'm keeping it for round two, which says a lot because I always hand down his things to others.
B000X4EUJK|5|Very happy with the quality. These are soft on little baby bums, but are still strong enough to hold the solids of the issue. I've never had one break. This is the best brand that I have used, and I was very glad to find out they were made by the same people who make my clothe diapers! Bumgenius.
B001AH8JNC|3|Not water proof so if your kid practices proper hygiene it will ruin this product
B0035LQNNE|5|These are great for travel. They hold a little more than the medela bags in my opinion and they are cheaper.
B00P5USFBG|5|This amazing bottle maker is great for all formula moms. While yes nursing is the best, some of us just can’t do it for medical, baby reason and so on. Out of the few I reviewed that aren’t like this one alone, by far this one is the best. Has a formula, water, with options of sanitize, and temperature. To first use, you need to run the machine twice before using it. Once done, add the formula, and the water for starters. Any sized bottles can be used, with small bottles it has a stand for accuracy. The smart accuracy has a chip in it, and temperature gauge in the water area for warming the bottle. Holds up to 300 grams of formula lasting us 2-4 days. It also has sensors to tell you when the formula and water is low. You can pick room temp to warmer temp for the bottles. Then this has a self-cleaning option which also sanitized the whole machine as well. Also has a soft night-light on it, for the middle of the night feedings. The machine itself is about 6 pounds, and with water and formula only adds on few extra pounds, making it easy to travel with. The dial you turn to which OZ bottle you would like to use, then hit go, and does everything for you in the matter of a minute and half. This did make a few messes after we found out which bottles it liked the best. The bottles with the bigger openings worked the best, the smaller ones like Gerber and such did make messes. This is first for the system so you will find flaws like anything else, but for us it worked perfectly after we found what worked better for it.
B000IDSLOG|5|was a big hit with the teething two year old i have it to.  became his constant companion and his mother loved that it soothed him through teething.
B004QXZEKI|5|We purchased this for a trip from California to NY hoping it would fit the BOB, and protect the stroller from airline mutilation.  Success! The bag fits, is solid, protective and sturdy, and our stroller was in perfect shape when we arrived in NY. A little pricey, yes, but worth protecting a $600+ stroller.
B00HAZSE7Y|2|Poorly made. Mine was falling apart when it arrived. I have to buy a button and fix it myself. Still never used.
B00M56DLZS|4|This thing is SOLID. I knew the box was coming, but it was HEAVY! Definitely make sure you have help to move it!<br /><br />This dresser is nice. It was fairly simple to put together. I originally had a dresser from South Shore but it's mostly particle board and rather flimsy (I had some books on the top and it bowed so the top drawer was rubbing). I like the snap together pieces... they're not very flimsy, so it can be a bit of a workout to snap it all together... But really though, it was easy to put together.  I know some folks said the drawers slide awful, but I think they based that on the first few slides. After a day of use, it opens and closes fine!<br /><br />The one thing I have noticed that other people have mentioned is that the paint is not the prettiest job. There are streaks and blobs of heavy paint. Considering the cost, you would think the paint job would be nicer.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice dresser! It's solid and it looks pretty classy!
B005BW1RL8|5|This toy has been a life saver.  I use it in stores, restaurants, at red lights, wherever! It always helps amuse my kid when I need to keep him occupied.
B002C6EA92|4|Comfortable and sturdy, my one-year-old loves being carried around in his Metro. We've used it at airports (useful for when you check the stroller in but have a transit flight!) and plan to use it when travelling through Germany soon. The only drawback: it doesn't come with a sunshade and, frankly, that's annoying. I understand the need to squeeze as much as you can from parents but surely that could've bern included in the price!
B005O7N6XW|5|These are BPA free. Very vibrant  and high contrast colors that babies will love! Very easy to hold on to for babies learning to grab things. Some of the links have little nubbies on them (feels good on teething babies gums) and some are smooth. The circle that the links are on is not connected to that black and white ball on one side however. So they come off rather easy.
B00KTGNIYU|5|For me, it would be a great grandchild that this is ideal for. As noted by the only other reviewer right now, it is really secure clipped to diapers.  The simulated heart beat is just right.  So this pacifier and clip is perfect for the newborn.
B004AHMCKU|5|My 5 month old loves this toy.  The vibrating feature makes him giggle; he stares at the bright colors, and he loves the crinkling sounds when he grabs. it.
B00JWX0SL2|5|Love, love, love these! They are easy to use and work great with my Medela pump! Super easy for my husband to hook up to the bottle to feed baby. Highly recommend you try it!
B0006GDGAE|5|I've been using this for a couple months now with my 26 month old son and my 4 month old son.  My son calls it the double chariot.  It rides smoothly and is wonderful.  The 20 inch wheels make it as easy to push as my toddler in just a single stroller with 16 inch wheels.  It would be nice to have it fold up and be more portable, but it is possible to fold down if you take the wheels off, which isn't a whole lot harder than the folding q models anyway.  I highly recommend it for the high mileage runner.
B004A6I9XU|1|My son was born in January . Loved this product up until today it broke . Bottle warming side keeps beeping and doesn't heat bottle up. After reading other reviews I will not go for second ! Disappointing .
B000F1OPZU|5|I read up on some other competitors and finally decided to go with this one.  I absolutely LOVE IT, and I HIGHLY recommend it!  It does not come with a separate carrying bag because the product itself folds into its own bag.  It is a bit bulky (but still neat and cushiony for baby) if you are carrying other items, but it has a small double strap to use for carrying it.  The best workaround for me to get it to work with most all highchairs is to 1st sit the baby in your lap (or get a helper to hold it), and put the baby's feet/legs in first.  Then, you can easily sit the baby in the high chair, and the buggy bagg follows suit.  You can then fold the sides down.  I have had many people to ask me about it and who also like it.  I also enjoy the zipper pouches in the back flap for putting extra items in.  This is the best out there for what it does.
B002VUCBC2|5|I read a few reviews, some obviously mixed. I am always hesitant when I see one or two bad ones. But I was desperate to put him in something that he would enjoy and of course help strenthen his legs. Alright,...honestly...so I can clean my house without him giving me the puppy eyes to pick him up all the time. In any case, he LOVES it!!! The product was easy to assemble and so far that I see, we have had no accidents or hazards occur. Whether or not it strenthens his legs...well I am not doctor. But does it give me a little break without the guilt...absolutely. We're both happy:) Oh, he's 4 months just in case you were wondering for your little ones. (Obviously, having him in the same room supervised is best.)
B007ZZCR6S|3|The box it came is was torn and battered.  We received it a few days before the baby shower so no time to return it and had to gift the ugly box. However, the recipient was please with the product.
B001A0M3LI|5|Even after I deliver, I will continue to use this pillow! It's the most comfortable pillow on the planet and it absolutely helps me sleep/get more comfortable at night.
B000MGL2UE|5|I've tried many burp cloths as a new mom, and this is the only one I've bought more of.  They don't get all bent out of shape after washing and drying.  They're as absorbant as they are pretty, and they're big enough to only need one.  I even use one as a changing pad, in a pinch.
B004DC9TFS|5|LOVE it!!  Worth every penny!  Amazing quality, easy to push, durable, great on sidewalk or tough terrain.  No comparison btw BOB and other brands we have had in past.
B003LQMZS0|5|Bought the giraffe and the zebra for my great-granddaughter and granddaughter.  They both love them and play with them all the time on their tummy-time mats.  A lot of different things to stimulate them.
B007X63CYK|4|Well made love all the colors fits great
B002IVTPIW|2|Unlike all other inflatable beds I've owned this one has two valves, one for the mattress portion and one for the outer shell.  There is a design flaw in the mattress valve.  It is not equipped with the flap to prevent air from escaping hen the pump is removed even though the shell valve has that feature.  Because of that I would not recommend this product.
B003N9M6YI|5|My son loves these teething keys!
B001COIH3A|3|I purchased this to use as a second monitor but ended up returning it for the much more reasonably priced Sony model because I felt that it was too quiet.
B00B4GVWWE|4|I ordered this one to use when my other wet bag is being laundered. I love the quality and the print is very pretty. Holds in smells and washes well. My only dislike is the zipper. You need two hands to open and close, and even then it can be difficult. You have to set down the dirty diaper to open it up. Makes it a pain when you're in a rush.
B003X15L5C|5|I spent months researching car seats to the point where I felt sick thinking about it.  I don't buy a rattle without researching it!  Our twin boys are not even two, but we had to get a front-facing car seat, because they are giants who longer fit in our rear-facing seats.  We wanted to buy a car seat that would last them until they didn't need a seat anymore, and because they are so big, we needed something roomy.  We were originally looking at the Graco Nautilus, but there were too many bad reviews about the distance between the back of the seat and the crotch strap.  It is true.  There is a big difference - by a few inches!  This seat keeps my boys locked in tight, but they are very comfortable in it.  My taller boy used to cry when we headed out to the car, now he says, &#34;Oooooh&#34; when he gets in.  We got the Cowmooflage model, because I read that it was softer than the other ones, and that is true.  We went to the store and felt the other models/colors.  They all had a mesh covering that was not soft or comfortable.  I can't imagine wanting to put my body against it, and when we go to the beach or pool, having to put their bare backs against it...yucka!  The Cowmooflage material is super soft, and super cute.  My friend teased me that the cow print is for girls, but I don't see how black and white cow print screams girl.  And we really don't care anyway.  It's adorable!  And now that we have them, my friend regrets getting a blue one and wished she had gotten the cow print too!  Totally worth a little more money.  When I found this one, I knew this was the one for us, but I kept going back to the fact that is was a little bit more.  Then logic clicked in...I think the safety of my little guys is worth an extra 40 or 50 or 100 dollars (or a million dollars!).  I'm always so busy trying to get the best deal that I forgot for a minute that we are talking about the safety and comfort of my children.  Buy some used toys and clothes and spend the extra money on this car seat!  You won't regret it!  My only &#34;complaint&#34; would be that I wish the cup holders were a little wider so they could fit their Tommee Tippee sippy cups, but that's being pretty picky.  Oh, one more thing, my husband installed the seats, not me, but he did not have any trouble at all.  It took him about a half an hour or so to install both seats.  I read a lot of reviews about how hard it is to install, but I think that just depends on the person.  We are not rocket scientists, but we are both pretty good at putting things together.  If that's not your strength, then I'd ask someone for help, but it's not as hard as some people would lead you to believe.this car seat!  You won't regret it!

B000324Y7U|5|This bouncer honestly saved my life when my newborn came into the world.  At times, as new parents, we could not figure out how to soothe our baby.  (Now we are pros with a baby who is happy and sleeps through the night for 12 hours since he was 4 months old!)  Anyway, we finally found out that occassionally he just wanted to be left alone.  When we put him in his Aquarium Bouncer, he was immediately soothed by the vibrations, soft music, and the sound of bubbling water.  He even fell asleep in it several times.  I would bring this chair into my bathroom and set it next to the tub while I soaked in a bubble bath.  What a luxury!  At 7 months, we still use this on occasion when he is fussy in the evening and not yet ready for bedtime.  He is a big baby and will outgrow it soon, which is sad.  I wish he could stay little forever!  But this bouncy chair was worth the small investment.  It still looks brand new and I will be saving it for my next baby...
B00JUGJXQW|5|bello!
B005WAT8RY|2|The top shelf was 7/16 of an inch too long. They sent a replacement part and it was the same length. It is a manufacture mistake. I did report this to the company. I had to take it to a carpenter/cabinet maker to help me finish putting it together. I am satisfied with the end product but it was very frustrating thinking you made a mistake in following the directions. Also, the drawer pulls were put on wrong,
B005CVX716|5|I received this chair ,,put it together in less than 20 minutes,,sat in the chair and omg it is one of the most comfortable gliders that I have ever purchased,,My grandson and I love gliding in it, he falls asleep quickly and I almost fall asleep in it also. As far as the squeaking this chair glides quietly,,and as far as the snaps I had no problem with that,,this chair deserves 5 stars,,and the price it great
B005EWF4BY|5|I bought this crib for our trip and had it sent to my mom's house ahead of our arrival.  She had it set up when we got there and setup was a breeze.  My son was about 4 months old at the time and was use to sleeping in a crib, just an FYI.  He slept like a dream in this little thing.  He loved it!<br /><br />It's SO LIGHT!  So easy to setup and folds up so nicely into it's little carrying case.  It's a bit pricier than other pack n plays or travel cribs, but so worth the price.  Excellent quality, and very comfy for my little one.  I would recommend it to anyone!
B00UGV8BEU|5|adorable!
B000N0SNHY|4|I like these bottle brushes but I wish that the nipple end had bristles. It's just a plastic ridged nub at the end.
B000XT30G4|5|This gate fit our hall (ADA compliant) that is quit wide.  The three extra sections that can be added or taken out as need, fit together very securely!  My husband's job relocates him often so we needed a gate that could we easily move (without wall damage), change size, yet still fit securely.  We needed a gate so we could keep our dogs out off of the carpet.  This gate easily with stands our excited 50 pound six month old puppy jumping (she still growing & like a bull in a china shop) up on it.  Even with that kind of abuse it has never once budged, damaged the walls, & doesn't even have any scratches or dinges!!!<br />  The only con I could even think of (which is so minor) is the tool they send to help secure the gate was awkward to use.  It still does the job though.
B00G4DHQ2M|5|Shaidee is an outstanding new product every parent of wee ones should have. A terrific way to protect your beauties from the sun without dousing them with suncreen. Works in all weather (sun, wind, rain), is especially terrific while vacationing or at the cottage, and is perfectly light-weight. Also a terrific shower gift!!
B007WELVYG|5|Pretty, well made and gender neutral -- so perfect for new parents with a boy or a girl. The horse theme was a plus for me.
B004B762AK|3|We were given an old Summer Infant monitor from a friend who didn't need theirs anymore.  The unit was about four years old and started having a lot of problems.  I didn't really mind that it became faulty after four years and I had liked the unit so I bought the new one.  Overall there were many things I like about the unit; most of what reviewers state in terms of ease of use (easy sleep buttons, easy zoom button, good picture quality) is true.<br /><br />My issue with this unit is the audio.  Our daughter sleeps with a sound machine going and even with the volume on the lowest setting, it was still incredibly noisy - which was very annoying when we were trying to sleep.  We even turned her sound machine completely off and STILL noticed a lot of white noise coming from the unit.  The audio is just excessively loud.  We have a 2,000 sq ft home and I never even had to turn the volume up from the lowest setting.<br /><br />I ended up returning the unit because of this.
B00337QSSA|5|just how i expected to be and my son's nursery looks fantastic i definitely would buy another bedding set from genny. shipping was on time.
B00BBMJBJC|4|I am pleased with the super soft minky aqua cover I just received!  Product is great & fits my two sided changing pad perfectly.  It appears to be homemade however.  I was a little surprised at how it was packaged or \\"not packaged\\" as it was.  No professional wrapping or tags, just placed in a priority mail envelope with a sticker on the outside.  Odd, but non-the-less the product is nice.
B007VBXKG2|5|Thanks to Amazon...nicely packaged...everything is perfect...have not used it yet...waiting for the baby...:) but one of my relatives used the product and recommended it...so it should work perfectly too!
B004HKIC4A|5|Love Pepperpot baby books. I have them for all three of my children. Space for family histories, photos, personal notes from parents, and birthdays up until the age of 5.
B0042D69YM|5|When I first started researching high chairs, I wasn't completely sure I knew what I needed, since I was buying one before we began feeding our baby solids...but I did know some things I didn't like from seeing high chairs while babysitting or visiting friends' houses.  So far, we've loved the high chair for these reasons:<br /><br />-The tray is super easy to get on and off, you don't have to jiggle it around to get it in just the right place for it to latch.  I have arthritis in my hands and easy buttons/connections are important to me!<br />-The seat is indeed easy to clean for all the reasons Fisher-Price mentions--no seams or crevices for food to get stuck into, the fabric wipes easily and is easy to take on/off and throw in the washer.<br />-The straps wipe clean in two seconds, avoiding the disgusting collection of food and grime that happens with many other types of straps<br />-The recline feature is easy and fast to adjust (like the tray, has a very easy button) and reclines well for young infants.  We actually bought the highchair originally because our son hated when we would eat together and always fussed until we put him on our laps.  He was much happier in the chair where he could see us and was able to be reclined enough since he was not yet sitting up.
B00BXE67VS|2|We used this product for a year or so with our first child. After a couple of weeks use, I was ready to stop using it, but the cost of the product and the expensive refills made us persevere with it. I guess we were trying to kid ourselves that we hadn't wasted our money. It's pretty hard to get around the final analysis of this product: a glorified trash can with very expensive refill bags. You could just about manage to justify the expense, if it kept baby's room odorless. But it doesn't. Inevitably, every time you place a diaper in the Genie, the odor-trapping doors open, and out comes an ungodly stench to the power of a maximum of 100 newborn diapers. The Genie made its way to the attic, where it still languishes unloved, even with the arrival of our second child. Our simple solution to poopy diapers? Bag 'em and take 'em straight outside. It's really not as hard as you might imagine.<br /><br />If you live on the top floor of a 100 story building, I would recommend buying a trashcan with a secure lid rather than this product. You'll get the same advanced odor blocking technology, and bags that cost a tiny fraction of the price of Genie refills.
B00ATLOSU8|1|The motorized car stopped working after 3 uses.  Complete waste of money.  The box it comes in is very large so its too big a hassle to return. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!
B001L2SA6M|5|So good!
B00BOHJRYI|1|Do not buy this decal. I am so disappointed that I cut up all of the pieces ready to begin, placed the pieces where I wanted them on the wall with painter's tape and then wasted my time and money. Every part of the decal began peeling the same day I put them up. I have experience putting up decals and did every step prior, including making sure the wall was completely clean. The decal stickers are of very poor quality.
B000YBILWY|3|I got the true fit for my 2nd child from when he was 4 months+ because we weren't sure anything would fit rear facing in our Buick Century. He has never really liked it. He gets overheated because of the velour material. His backside buries deep into the seat. I find that I have to keep readjusting the back padding to keep straps in place and stop hard lumps and bumps from digging into his skin. I overcame the deep seating problem by putting in our own extra padding. I also had to put in extra padding for his head. He is now comfortable enough that I won't bother getting him a different seat, but I am much more satisfied with my Britax Boulevard that we got for our 1st child. I think a 2nd Boulevard would have fit fine rear facing.
B00009EF0F|5|On Sunday June 27,2004 We were in a major rollover accident with a drunk driver. Thankfully all of us were in our seatbelts. My son was in this car seat and it was the only thing that saved him. I love this seat to death. I am definently replacing it with the same seat.      Leslie
B007SR3B9K|5|Absolutely love this thing
B00GU07FLQ|5|This product is amazing! I am soooo paranoid about SIDs and this keeps me confident that my daughter is safe while she sleeps in her room..especially because she is a belly sleeper. Highly recommend this product to anyone!!! Only thing I would change is that its not really portable... I need something that can go with us when we are out of town. But otherwise, I LOVE IT!
B001IJ4N00|5|Love this Boon product! Holds a lot. Love the design of the ladybug! There nothing I don't like about it.
B003EUEOPK|5|Very niceï¼
B004CLBX2M|5|Sometimes trigger for latch gets stuck, bang a couple times and voila.
B0006HBS1M|5|This is a great manual pump. I have an electric pump from lansinoh but purchased this medela for work. This medela pump is great, easy to clean and convenient.
B003U2SDQS|5|It fits right in my stainless steel trash can with a lid. works great. love the zipper on the bottom
B00F2MQ294|5|This is one of the best baby items I've bought so far! I do not know what I would do without it.  It is sturdy and so easy to clean and very portable.
B00I6GQUCC|1|Horrible, was ready to build it took it to my gf's house when we found out it was missing all the bolts, thanks a lot
B000FFL58Q|3|I have twins, and bought two playmats - this one and the Tiny Love.  I have to say the Tiny Love wins hands-down, though this one does have some nice features.  I would give it 5 stars if it only had more toys on it to hold baby's attention, but it is very sparsely populated in the toy department.    Pros:     has nice music and a couple of flashing lights    has a detachable monkey which the babies LOVE - they try to eat him every chance they get    babies also like the elephant rattle and spinning wheel toy    babies like looking at the playmat animals during tummy time - very cute design!      Cons:     There definitely aren't enough toys on this!  If they don't want to include more toys, at least include enough toy holders so you can add your own.    The toys that are included aren't all that interesting, with the exception of the three I mentioned.      The mirror on the giraffe points in the wrong direction - not toward the center of the mat as in the ad, but parallel with the edge, a position in which the baby would never be.  I have to hold the mirror for baby to see herself during tummy time.  No way to get it to point in the right direction.    To my horror, I turned around to see baby holding the mirror that had fallen out of the red frame and was about to chomp down - it's a thin, very sharp disc.  Baby would easily have cut herself.  It's constantly falling out - I've had to restick that $@#! thing a dozen times and watch the babies like a hawk.  I've tried to glue it in, but need stronger glue I suppose.    The butterflies at the top should spin - seems like they are supposed to spin, since they are on a mobile that rotates - but they do nothing, and are too high up for babies to reach.  Are we supposed to spin it for the babies?  It's in an awkward position for this.  Maybe mine is broken.    Overall I'd say this is cute, but kind of worthless overall and expensive.  There are much better playmats out there.  I have the rainforest bouncy seat which the girls absolutely love, which is why I bought this playmat, but now wish I hadn't.
B000069EXQ|5|Nice quality and very warm. Easy to zip.
B000M51PE8|5|This mirror is well worth the money, we had a cheaper mirror that the image was distorted and was hard to place, this mirror is clear and was easy to install and our daughter loved it.
B00C78G2BE|5|My baby with silent reflux sleeps in here. It's bigger than the rock and plays and costs half as much.
B00E8KJYNC|5|I loved it but my daughter said that the daily maintenance was too much for a new mom.
B004L2JJBE|4|These worked as advertised and have been doing a decent job and keeping imprints off our seats.  I didn't really expect more than what they are.  They seem to be one size fits all.
B00EU76CCY|5|This went up very easily and has stayed put.  Have gotten many compliments.
B00I2X6RP4|4|I ended up getting this play pen when the one I had originally purchased came defective. This one was on clearance and had some awesome features so I picked it up. It was very easy to put together only took me about 30 minutes at 8  months pregnant. The changing table was a good idea however, it just doesn't really work well . It kind of sits up and seems very out of place and not for a growing or even large baby. The bassinet seems ok and I like the ease of the design as well as the window panels that allow you to see baby. The hood is kind of large and does not have the ability to be pushed back which would be helpful for when you are not right with baby. All in all for the price and the ease of putting it together I would purchase again. But would suggest those minor improvements to really get the most out of the product.
B00RYU9FZA|5|Love, love, love this bag! I have 2 (soon to be 3!) kids, 4 & 2 at present and this bag is awesome for our outings. Generally if we're just running to the grocery store I just bring a purse with an extra pull-up, but anything over an hour or so requires more supplies. At first, I wasn't sure that the bag would be big enough, since the large pocket only has 2 inner pockets on one side. But once I started organizing I realized it has a lot of space! I love that I have my own place that is large enough to hold my wallet, keys, tissues, sunglasses, chap stick, notepad, phone, etc. It's really nice to not have to dig around the whole bag. I ended up putting a change of clothes, snacks, small toys, first aid stuff in the large pocket & its side pockets. The other &#34;medium&#34; pocket holds diapers and wipes. Then you still have the side pockets (which are insulated for bottles). Currently I use one for a water bottle, and the other for trash. If my next baby takes a bottle you can easily fit 2 in each pocket, which seems like more than I'd need. I've gotten compliments on how cute the bag is. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a cross-body strap. The handles are actually a nice length (not too tight on the shoulder), but I like the cross-body for trips to the zoo, etc. I ended up attaching my padded lap top strap to the stroller hooks and it works like a charm when needed, and I just pop it off and keep it in the bottom of the large pocket when I don't need it. So far I just love this bag!
B00GU4APL4|5|I love this saying! It was easy to install and I have it in a place where I see it every day and it gives me the strength to keep moving forward!
B0011URFRE|5|Hands down the best car seat I have ever had. It was easy to put together, easy to install in my car, and my son LOVES it! He's 2.5 years old. He likes the cubby holes in the arm rests, and likes the cup holder. The positioning of the belt clip does not seem to be a problem. There is so much padding on this seat and he tells me all the time \\"Mommy I like my car seat!\\" Def would reccommend to everyone.
B000X5J1H0|5|Had these when I was a kid, naturally Grandma got these for my son as well.  He's used them for a couple years now.  The lids are a bit chewed on, but still our go- to cups.  Can't go wrong only wish they were cheaper, but well worth the cost.
B0000CCOJM|4|I purchased this ExerSaucer about three weeks ago for my 5 month old daughter. She absolutely loves it! She loves batting and pulling on the toys especially the koala bear which she loves to chew on. The only problem I have with the ExerSaucer is that she has pulled the koala toy out from the hole it is supposed to be locked into many times. By doing this she has hit herself in the face several times and poked herself in the eye with the end piece which has sharp edges.
B007UYBOK4|5|Easy to install in my suv!!  My two year old granddaughter is very comfortable in the seat. Love the cup holder. Exceeds my expectations!!
B002BIBSWI|5|Love the color, how it's made... Everything! Just like the picture!
B002J4U8N4|5|My daughter loves to play with the cube. Its is her favourite! The books are also nice, easy to hold and easy to clean.
B0033RIE28|5|This product is fantastic.  Space saving because it is a swing and vibrating chair in one, it does both really well, and the seat is nice and deep so it can accommodate a newborn and an older baby.  It is easy to move around and easy to use.  There are several speed settings for the swing.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that it appears to take two separate sets of batteries.  The moble is also nothin special.
B006AW3A0E|1|It leaned to one side, and it being a device for a newborn baby, this is a bad thing. It is cheap and rocked poorly. It looked great in the room and was beautiful for photos. So basically, it was useless.
B000RFC3BM|5|I love these bowls. They're the perfect size for my son's meals and the lids fit VERY tight, to the point that they can be difficult to put on the first few times. They've also held up well to the abuse of the microwave and dishwasher. I wish they made these in a slightly larger version as a step up for older kids. I haven't used them for this purpose but I think they would be great for traveling because the lids fit so tightly.
B003AO6ZQ6|2|i LOVED this tub until it started losing air every other day, then every day, now it's while we're using it!  the sealers are not tight and keep popping open.  this seemed like the perfect tub, but now i view it as a waste of money and space in my bathroom.  :(
B000RH8Q3Y|4|This stroller bag is excellent for the money.  I will say it is a little thin, therefore the 4 star, but I really cant complain about it.  Easy to adjust the strap and makes carrying a stroller through the airport a breeze.
B006JHD5V4|3|The pacifier itself is very soft and natural, but it's too big. it touched my 7 months old baby's nostrils and bothers her. sometimes even covers her nostrils which really concerns me a lot.<br />Also, the candle is too big as well. She gets very intertwined by it and forgets to sleep.
B004OZ23B6|5|My wife and I tried a few different cups to transition from a soft nipple and this is the cup that did the trick. Doesn't leak and easy for my daughter to suck liquid from. Very nicely designed lid that makes it easy for her to get out of the bottle/soft nipple phase. Highly recommend!!!!
B002QVX9GI|5|very nice and good
B00KGYOAII|3|I like it. I can't imagine NOT having it, but I wish the length o the console was better utilized. The cup holders and the small zipper compartment in the middle is the same size as the single BOB handlebar console - with 2 kids now, I have twice the stuff to carry, so I just wish it had a little more room. Overall, I'm happy with it though.
B000HIP38Y|3|This turtle bath thermometer works well once it turns on and before you remove it from the bath. Unfortunately, it can take up to a minute before the digital read out turns on after you place the turtle in the water (not a big deal, but a bit annoying). The really annoying thing about this thermometer is that it beeps continuously, sometimes for hours, after it is removed from the bath water. It is beeping because the temperature is below the acceptible range, but for some reason the theormometer doesn't turn off once it is taken out of the tub. We usually have to bury it in towels to supress the beeping noise. Last night I woke up in bed 6 hours after we had bathed our little one and the turtle was still beeping in the bathroom! Just a little bit annoying...<br />I'm now searching amazon for a replacement.
B0042RU2SW|5|The mat itself is larger than most activity gyms so my squirmy baby has plenty of room to wiggle around. My 12 yr old has also joined him in the gym, and while they were cozy, they still had room to play.<br /><br />The toys are adorable and have different textures and sounds. They are easy to detach and move around or take to the stroller, but not so easy enough that baby can remove them.<br /><br />The quality is excellent. Very sturdy.<br /><br />My 6 month old loves this activity gym! He can't crawl or walk yet but when being held he wiggles to try to get to the floor to play in his gym. I know he would rate it a 5 too.
B0040QWE3G|3|Suction does not work well ring hard to put back on. Plates a are cute.
B00A49XDR4|5|Good price and easy to use
B007CTPWXW|5|I was always fishing around in the large, zipped back pouch on the stroller for whatever I needed.  The organizer has a place for my taser, keys, both of our drinks, my cell phone, and my gloves.  The organizer arrived promptly, was packed well and was well worth the money.
B006SFUEFC|5|As a past user of many similar products when my child was young I have recently used these gate devices more due to now having two poodles in our home.  Some are all plastic and they tend to be much heavier.  Many such gates do not adjust easily which tends to make their use a bit of a hassle.  The Munchkin Precision Fit 24\\" Gate hits a welcome \\"sweet-spot\\" as it is lightweight and easy to adjust, plus it comes on and off with little effort when needed.  When it is properly set it is secure and the unit gives the impression it won't be breaking any time soon.  I think this is the one gate I enjoy using the most and I recommend it.
B000JFEV1K|5|I use mine to attach reusable bags to my stroller when I head to the store or pick up packages. Sometimes, the bags hit the wheels of my stroller, but I just keep it in the middle of the stroller and that works.
B0000D9RQ2|4|I got this travel swing for a shower gift along with a full-size swing. I didn't know if I would need both, but I put both together anyway. I actually started using the travel swing a couple days after I got home from the hospital. The full-size swing just seemed too big for my 7lb. newborn. The travel swing is so much closer to the ground- it made me feel more secure. I have been very pleased with this swing. I love the easy mobility and actually move it throughout my house. (I love that I can blow dry my hair with my baby rocking in the swing right next to me!) The lack of head support wasn't really a problem. For the first few weeks I used a head support from Boppy called Noggin Nest- it worked just fine. Sure the music may be a bit annoying after awhile, but what isn't? You can easily switch the music off and keep the swing going. As my 5 week old gets older, if he needs more to interest him than the mirror and toys that are provided, I can easily link new toys to the links on the sides of the swing for him to look at or play with. There aren't many things that will hold your newborn's interest for the first month. But this swing definitely held my son's interest and soothed him from the very start.
B003DZ13H8|5|My daughter LOVES this!!  It is so soft and cuddly!  :)  She got it for a gift when she was born but I have since bought it for others for a baby gift.  It's great!  :)
B003ZFPRHS|4|At first I purchased aquatopia turtle that is another best seller here on amazon, but didn't like that it takes too long for the thermometer to warm up and get the right temp. This one is better, much faster I tested these two side by side. The only thing I miss is Celsius
B00171WXII|5|Great product! I know it sounds gross, but I swear this product does the job. I recommend this to all mothers. You might want to buy a extra pack of filters, since you will need to change those out reguarly.
B007OV08XM|5|we love the fun monsters on them. love that they are boy prints but cute and fun and of course this is their fav binkie so it helps :) i will be ordering more soon
B004MDL5V4|4|the product was just what i wanted and was ;ooking for. i love it other then it was smashed in the box and now the hood thing was bent hoping it straightens out
B0002JETOC|5|This gate works well for keeping my cats out of the bedroom.  It's very easy to use with just one hand - you just need to find the right size for your door, and then the pressure holds it in place.  I'm fairly certain that even a heavier animal wouldn't be able to knock this down.
B00ECHYTBI|5|Works pretty well. Setup is quite simple. We had an issue with the monitor just a bit more than 3 months after we bought this. The issue was that the monitor wouldn't charge. Called the support number and we figured out through some basic diagnostics that the problem was not the battery, but the monitor itself. They offered to replace the monitor. I was asked to send the monitor via &quot;the most economical method&quot; back to them and send them a photo of the return package/mailing receipt. As soon as I did, they shipped the replacement monitor and I got it the next day.<br /><br />I was out about $5 for shipping the return, which was not substantial, but would have been nice if they'd offered a pre-paid mailing label for it.
B001RJMSL2|1|I had a crummy experience with this order. I received the wrong brand when the order came and I had to return the item. This was no small thing since I had given it to my son for his new baby, he lives 15miles away. To return the item, I had to bring it back to my house or they wouldnt pick it up for me. I reordered the item and once again I got the wrong crib. I had the second one delivered to my sons house and it was picked up there for return. We ended up getting it from another vendor, amazon couldnt get this purchase correct. To add insult to injury, they gave me a credit of $80 when I got the first item, and when they credited me for the purchase they subtracted the $80 from the credit; so I got nothing for the inconvenience.  I paid a friend with a van $25 to deliver the crib to my son for me, and then I had to pay again to get it back to my house. Amazon has ignored my complaint and I feel ripped off. They should have left me with the credit at least.
B0031Y146G|5|They work well, I really like them.
B001P32Y3C|5|I purchased this recently for my nephew's birthday because he is in love with flashlights, and he absolutely loves it.  He just turned 2, and my brother said that night when little man went to bed, he had to have his turtle and he was mesmerized and kept saying \\"Look!\\" until he finally fell asleep.  Not only that, but his mom loves how it is supposed to show actual constellations.  I am now considering purchasing one for my daughter when she gets a little bigger.
B004HVB4D0|5|These are adorable and I get compliments EVERY time I take my daughter out in them! Thank you very much!
B001KZH69C|3|This mattress pad is not by American Baby Company.  It is made by TL Care. As many other reviewers have stated the color is a cream/neutral color, not the white shown in the photo.
B001MS83OE|5|I ordered 2 of these and they are great to put on a dresser or changing table. My son kept hitting his head on the edge of his changing table so that is the reason I ordered the 4 sided pad and it protects his head from the board.
B00T5GX8K4|5|Good product, great price! I purchased 2 in the color blue. The pillow was a bit smaller than I expected, but good enough to hold my son's head up. I like that the cover is machine washeable and pillow is easy to attach to the seat belt.
B00278WA4W|5|These are the only sippy cups that have never leaked!!  Love them!
B0013DZIAA|4|The silky feel on one side and soft, fuzzy feel on the other makes a cuddly contrast.  Very nice for touching while falling asleep.
B004JU0H7I|5|This is perfect, just what every toddler needs when he/she falls asleep after all their playing.  Our toddler noticed the difference immediately and he looks so comfortable.
B000U5FOQA|5|Searched everywhere for a gate to keep my two dogs contained in one area of my home. Wanted something that didn't look like every other gate I'd seen, and would actually look nice. This is it!! Everyone that's seen it comments on how nice it looks. I love that it swings in either direction. It's very easy to lock and unlock. It's a great product for the price.
B001H0GGNM|5|This seat has really good padding as compared to other backless boosters. We use ours in a school carpool and it is very easy for my child to move it to different cars. She can also buckle the seatbelt herself with no problem. My daughter loves the hot pink color. Looks like clean up on this seat will be a snap.
B009ILY8I2|5|My baby boy loved this cup! It was a great transition to cups for him. Took some time to get used to it, but he loved it in the end. Recommended product!!
B000I2Q0F4|5|I recently got this toy for my son because of all the great reviews on amazon. I will say this is a great distraction toy that he really enjoys. Awesome toy
B00IX3QS34|5|I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation.<br /><br />This is a great basic case that both looks nice and fits well.
B000N0SNHY|5|All as expected
B0088EA6MC|5|Love the sheets and they fit perfectly on her crib mattress.
B0043XEIMG|5|SUPER SOFT!! I have washed it several times and it still looks like new!<br />I have ordered more for baby shower gifts.
B00V7VK3I0|4|came with everything in the description.
B00HU7DM8I|4|The spoons stain quite easily, just keep that in mind.
B00ISS2QEO|5|After searching for the best carseat to replace our seats after our accident we purchased these.  My kids love them and I'm completely satisfied.  I would recommend these to anyone!
B001JJCMJ8|5|We ordered this plush for our 8 month old, who seems to really like owls and alligators. (Who doesn't?) When he arrived we were thrilled with the quality. He is very full and fluffy, not cheaply filled at all. It is a great toy for my son to cuddle up with and rest on. Oh, and as others have said, he is a large sized plush who you can set on the couch or a chair and have a nice kid's room filing item to look at. Since he arrived, Stig (as he goes by) has become my son's favorite plush. My son gets very excited when he sees him and crawls for him every time. They appear to have a ball together and are inseparable. I would recommend this toy without any doubt in doing so.
B006GYLL8Y|1|I originally got this cup for my 12 month old because she can hold it herself while she sips.  It certainly has not held up to my expectations.  When she drinks the lid gets tilted down, letting the liquid flow into the lid.  The downside is that a little leftover liquid is usually trapped within the lid.  So if the cup is tipped it will spill.  You also need to make sure you take apart the cup.  I usually dishwash the cup and it has held up well.  Mold was growing in the lid on one of my cups.  It was disgusting and thank god I caught it before I gave it to my baby.
B000I2MRLK|5|Our daughter has been enamored with Jacques since she was 2 months old.  At almost 6 months she still reaches for him and enjoy his pretty colors and crinkly feathers.  This is the only toy that can hold her attention for long periods of time.  She does not like any of the other Lamaze toys (including the turtle whose mirror is too hard for an infant).
B000AV7O4O|3|Okay, I would have given 5 stars IF THERE WAS A WAY TO MOUNT W/O THOSE WORTHLESS TAPE STRIPS.  Sorry, its frustrating.  Unless you have a bare WALL in the bath (not tile) I wouldnt recommend.  We tried the command strips and it didnt hold on the tile-too heavy with toys (plus this is heavy w/o toys).<br /><br />We are still trying to figure something out, so if anyone figures out what to do to mount it through tile, let me know!<br /><br />If you do have a wall you can mount it to, this thing is great!  LOVE it
B00AWAWMHC|3|Don't like the fact that the sound box is not attached and moves all over the place.  Sound is not the same
B003D3NVP2|3|Super soft but too short for the pillow.
B00AO084BI|1|I bought this because it says swing + bouncer. this is not a bouncer. it only swings and vibrates. the motor ticks everytime it sways back and forth as well.
B00NGZ0Y7A|5|Another great purchase of a silicone product.  Very bright and colorful!
B006WM8A9I|5|Easy to port, easy to adjust, she loves riding in it.  The only thing I don't like is that the wheels close against the canopy, and it stained black very quickly.
B000MOL2EW|5|got for my Granddaughter who just graduated from Veterinary college University of Georgia Veterinary school. I am sure she will love it
B000YDDF6O|5|I discovered this four years ago, and have purchased at least 5 more since then.  As each new baby came along Great Grandma started them out with this toy.  I hear it fast becomes one of their favorites.
B001I1CFKI|5|We liked the flatwear eventhough they are a bit big for our 17 months baby. He had issues controlling them at the beginning but now he is able to put food in his mouth. We 100% recommend them, easy to wash,  we just wish to have a case to carry them around.
B008CDR7LW|4|My granddaughter loves this Octopus bath toy.
B00MC8GQ3I|3|It's smaller than I pictured but great for my 2 year old grandson.
B005KLNFWO|5|My little girl loved it! It's so soft and she loved the toys that make different sounds. I loved the seeing the joy of her playing and having a good time so it was worth it. This was a great buy!!!!!
B004J4VWZK|3|The size of the cover didn't fit our stroller - was too big. However, we were able to make it work.  Overall, it does the job. I don't like how it latches to the top cover - just sort of hooks over the top, with no ability to latch it to anything. As such (and this might be where the too big comes into play) it kept falling off from the top part.
B0052QYLUM|1|Okay, so I have ordered this unit twice now. The first time we purchased, we had issues with the monitor turning off frequently, and losing it's signal. I thought perhaps I had just received a defective unit, so I had returned and asked for a replacement. We received the second unit the other night, and quickly realized it wasn't just that unit.<br /><br />We woke up this morning to a screaming baby, while we turned and looked at the baby monitor only to find a frozen picture of her sleeping soundly. Again, I really wanted to give this unit a chance. It was affordable, durable, and had all of the right features...unfortunately, it's garbage. Avoid!
B002FQKB4M|5|I use mine over the Jeep Liberty Urban Terrain stroller, it fits great.it is so satisfying to see 20 Mosquitos on the net  and unable to get to my baby! I love that I don't need to cover her in chemical bug spray for our evening stroll.
B002147J48|3|Pros: 1. Doesn't leak. 2. Cute design. 3. Easy to put on and take off. 4. Cheaper price than other diaper covers. 5. Machine washable. 6. Holds up well (hasn't fallen apart and no tears). 7. Quick hang dry. 8. Fits to baby's shape well. 9. Not bulky. Cons: 1. Seems flimsy and too thin when you first receive it. 2. Too easy for baby to pull off, shouldn't be a problem for babies than don't take their diapers off yet. It's never come off by itself. 3. Thin material makes strapping the Velcro tight for thin babies difficult because when you strap them tight the straps peel back exposing Velcro. 4. Can't put in dryer, but dries quickly hanging. Good cover overall, I will purchase again.    Revision: I've changed my mind. My 13 month old is pulling this off entirely too easy, the Velcro is just too flimsy. This is not good for running around the house with just a diaper on but it's ok when the clothes are on. I will NOT be purchasing more of these, I'm opting for snaps now!
B002V92XAS|5|been using it for over a year & love it. Just wish the air freshener worked better.
B004CSNG6G|4|We've been using this for a few weeks now, and I'm pretty happy with it. We have a lot of other brands of diapers, and I like different thing about each one. The gussets in the fleece didn't contain the runny BF poop as I thought they would, but they didn't leak. The design is adorable and they seem to be wearing well.
B00CI4PKKG|5|The product itself is absolutely amazing! It is capable of doing so many things, and my little one just loves it. The projection portion is really the icing on the cake. It is what gives this product an edge, along with the fact that it can be a starry lamp once the product is no longer needed as a mobile in the crib. However, the way it is meant to attach to the crib is HORRIBLE! Both my husband and I were very nervous about the way it attached to the crib with the plastic screw and just over the top of the edge of the crib. We were appalled at how wimpy it was when attaching. You would think a popular and common product would have a much better way to attach to the crib. We played with it a few times before trying it with out little one, and thank God that we did! It was not very stable and kept falling with very little pressure applied. I was ready to send the product back very disappointed when my husband got a brilliant idea! He screwed a hole in the crib that was big enough for the scre portion of the mobile to fit thru. And then, with the piece that acts as a nut on a screw, screwed it on nice and tight. And now, there is no way that the mobile will fall. It took all of our nerves away and we can finally enjoy the product itself.
B001PBFWMO|2|Nothing really useful, do not use
B000X5J1H0|5|Loves these cups. Got new ones for my grandson. My kids had ones just like it. Lids are very tight so he can't get them off like he can some other sippy cups. Liquids will come out if turned side ways or upside down so we have to watch that. Otherwise a super cup!
B00FP1BOLS|5|I love this Days of Hunny Memory book. I was very pleased with it.
B005WH3RBU|5|Love this car seat!! Installs easily, cleans easily, can get child in and out easily... Not to mention it looks beautiful and my daughter is really comfortable in it. I'm glad I paid the extra money for this one.
B00Y9J7BNW|1|DO NOT ORDER THESE PLASTIC FALSELY advertised shoes!  I ordered a pair of yellow baby moccasins from  the following:     Baby Soft Leather Tassel Infant Boy Girl Sole Shoes Toddler Moccasin 11cm-15cm (12cm, yellow)    Sold by:  myztshop     $8.99  they were awful, flea market plastic, when they  swore they were  'soft leather'.  here's another deceitful part...when I went to do the review, (that they were plastic), the  'leave a review button' took me to a link that said ' gainbon' was the seller from whom they had come. Its like this new fraudulent seller  somehow , putting out a totally different product had ' become' 'Gainbon'.  I had gotten decent baby moccasins in the past a couple times from Gainbon, but apparently they are hooked to this other  fraudulent Co somehow, its pot luck people, good old China, yo never know what they are dong, what they will do or what you will get f  no matter how clear the facts  'mseem' to be.
B00B7M7BKW|5|Do what it does, will buy again for my next coming
B0024S7JI2|5|I love how this smells! I wish I could have my whole house smells like this and it lasts forever!
B000GF3M22|5|Worked exactly as advertised. Down side kept us dry when sitting on wet grass. Top side was fine - nothing special - but since what I wanted was a dry backside no matter where I sat this fit the bill! Loved the carrying case - just wish outer pockets were bigger.
B007XL89MA|5|Like with any baby product, different ones work for different babies.  These bottles work fantastically for our second daughter.  For the first couple of months, we used the same bottles that worked really well for our first (Avent).  But, for #2, this are significantly better at reducing gas.  She still burps like a grown person, and the air seems to release easier with burping rather than getting retained.  Happy baby and mom!
B00003TL7P|5|I BOUGHT 3 DIFFERENT ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE. THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN BAG ITS USER FRIENDLY AND IT KEEPS THE SMELL OUT.
B00168AS98|2|Not the best quality. The shelf itself seemed sturdy after I put it together, but the pegs are cheap and immediately broke. It was returned.
B005UV0UDG|4|Only one issue. Item looks red in picture. It's an orange.
B000056OUH|5|We purchased this because we live in Italy and the water is frequently nonpotable.  This has been a great investment.  I have sterilized pacifiers and hard plastic toys as well as the avent bottles.  I have even used it to sterile parts of a playtex bottle that I use occasionally.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants to sterize their bottles.  We have a medium to small microwave and it fits fine.  The box will tell you how many minutes you need to sterilize depending on different wattages.  Very easy to use.
B003K0AJ6M|5|I bought this not to keep moisture in, but to keep it out! I use it on our boat. It is splash proof and a great bag to toss my phone and camera in.
B00AV53ZCY|3|Bought these hoping they would last longer than the other sippy spouts (have a 1.5 year old chewer). While they do stand up to the chewing the water comes out soooooo slowly that she gets frustrated and wasn't drinking as much water. We are back to the old spouts even though they leak all over if she tips the bottle.
B001OC5UMQ|5|We have had the gate now for about three weeks and we love it.  We have placed it at the top of the stairs to the basement as a pet barrier.  We are often carrying things to and from the basement and it is easy to open and close even while carrying things.  We don't need to lock the latch since we are not using it for children and this makes it even easier to open and close.  The tension child barriers required two hands to remove and replace and was very difficult to step over if you had your hands full - a real pain.  I would highly recommend especially as a pet barrier.  We have no small children, but I would suspect it would serve equally as well.
B00GU2WAIW|5|Worked well. Not as large as I was expecting from their description.
B00F2MQ9R4|3|nice toy but it should have been musical, this would have made it more loveable! And there sholud be more characters
B00020V5A2|5|I bought this monitor over two years ago, and still love it! Especially now that my son is out of the crib. I make sure he is not being mischievous at night without him knowing. I also enjoy plugging this into the television and recording the times when he is being mishievous, or just plain cute.
B00005UC6D|2|There are a few things in this kit I use all of the time...The nail clipper I love, the hair brush my 9 month old loves (I don't know why, but he finds it fascinating). But overall, this is cheaply made, and overpriced to boot. It's all made in china, I'm pretty sure it's not bpa free (I will never let my baby use the included teether or toothbrush), and some of it just doesn't work (for us, that would be the nasal aspirator-the free one we got from the hospital was far superior- and the thermometer, which broke after three uses, never read correctly). Seriously, go to target and look at other kits, or take my advice and buy each item separately..you'll be much happier.
B0052G4LUM|2|Product is not big.  Ad is very misleading. Shipping was horrible. When I received it, it was wrinkled.  The backing tape was peeling and it looked like it had been sitting in the sun for a week.  It made it hard for the letters to stick to the wall.
B001FY13F6|5|this stroller is great! i love it!!!  it is just as good as the more expensive brands.  actually it's better because you have the benefits of reclining, there is a drink holder, it's lightweight, and the canopy can completly cover a sleeping baby.  the only negative thing i can say is that it took about a week or so until i could easily fold the stroller.  so don't use it right out the box and travel to the airport and have difficultly folding it like i did! all in all it was a great buy and i am happy i didn't spend the extra $200 for the Maclaren stroller.
B008TML9AQ|5|With a new grandson I wanted my own comfy cradle for him when he visits; in terms of its visual appeal it is quite attractive, somewhat on the minimal side and it suits the cradle's intended mobility and convenience. It is easy to assembly, with a detachable veil like canopy, and a removable mattress pad that can be wiped clean and re-covered with the organic cotton sheeting (see note below) for baby. It is a gentle movement, nothing jarring or even possible to jar. The baby's movements alone can cause some gentle movement, once it weighs enough. My grandson is just a week old so he looks lost in it, but that also tells me he will get probably 3 or 4 months if not more out of it.<br /><br />Initially I feared that the legs on the cradle would be insufficient support, not at all, and when set on a carpet it balances nicely, not tippy or awkward. On bare wood floors there are rubbery feet tips to keep it steady. The overall shape of oval cradle is pleasing, one can tuck a baby into a swaddled bundle and place in the center, no bars or impediments to cause baby any difficulties; it really is well thought out and made. With so many receptacles for babies (car seats, strollers, baby-totes, cribs, bouncy chairs, etc)the last thing baby needs is an uncomfortable cradle, this one is open but secure, gentle and conceived for baby's comfort. Can't ask for more than that.<br /><br />The pad itself does come out for cleaning and the mesh sides allow for air circulation, it is more durable than one would expect for a product with an eye on space saving. Babybjorn also makes an organic pad sheet with an elastic band to keep it in place that is easy to launder and apparently made without the chemicals etc that lead to allergen issues. The canopy is also gauzy and yet allows light to enter, if muted, which does well with a baby's eyes still learning to adjust to all the new very bright lights everywhere! It has a protective and cozy enclosure to it without preventing the parent from seeing baby, a very nice idea that is works beautifully.m seeing baby, a very nice idea that is works beautifully.
B004N3C30U|5|Very Nice for baby Stuff it does what is should and it makes cleaning a bit easier i like it
B000YDDF6O|5|baby boy loved it
B00IISOVSI|5|Will purchase these again. They held up great and I love the quality of the fabric and the fun, bright colors too.
B0085CBA90|5|these work great and I recommend them to every pumping mom to at least try out and see how they work!
B00FN6J2LO|5|My son loves it so much
B006YC6WY6|5|These are great place-mats for an infant-toddler. I bought these almost 2 years ago and they work great! We still use them and my daughter is now, 3. Despite numerous spills, tomato sauce accidents, etc; these look like new with no discoloration. Any crumbs on this; and you merely roll it up and unwind it over the sink or garbage. We've brought this mat overseas, on day-trips, etc.... We have one of these for the house and the other for trips out to restaurants, etc... Now that our daughter is now 3, we rarely bring one out to restaurants now. However, when we had a messy 1 year old with us in tow, wait staff were always quite grateful.
B00GPK8ODY|5|for my grandson
B00AWLZDH2|5|Wife really loves this.  She's able to get them organized from oldest to newest and fits perfectly in our freezer. She's only able to fit 10-12 in each rack so just letting you know in case you thought it could hold more.
B00005BTNA|5|very nice
B000TGTEK2|4|i bought it when he was a month old, first he loved looking at the black and white figure, then he reached for the legs which make a noise, then he caught the ring or the flowers, now he enjoys grabing it, and nibbling all the different parts and textures of it and hear the squeek when you press the belly.  the only problem - you can only surface-wash it... i whish i could put it in the washing machine...  but still - its my boy's favorite toy!!!
B0078LZHK2|5|very nice and the price is right.
B002HRFO3M|3|Good idea with this if your baby sits in the middle of the back seat.
B00AJSIW6C|5|Easy to move from car to car and just the right size.
B000S35QLC|5|I bought the Sony Baby Call (now priced at $69.95) when my son was born two and half years ago.  We love it.  We recently moved and the monitor still works great.  His room is downstairs and we are up.  I love that the batteries are rechargeable and the voice activation option.  My son has a white noise machine in his room and we never pick it up on the voice activation.  It only clicks on when he calls for us.    My daughter just moved into her crib and we needed a monitor for her.  I bought a cheap monitor from a local store to see if I would like it, but I can't stand another night of talk radio through the monitor. Plus, it eats 3AAA batteries every other day.     This yellow monitor is just the replacement for the blue baby call I bought for my son.  The detailed description on the Sony website is exactly the same, with a color change (yellow) to the monitor (and a lower price).  This is great for me, so I can tell the two apart.  I have not had any interference between the two monitors.  Also, my daughter sleeps later than my son, so her receiver comes downstairs in the mornings, but we can change the channels on it in the afternoon for my son's base and pick up his room.  Great when he's napping and we don't want to run upstairs again.     I've definitely been sleeping better since I got this monitor and have recommended it to all my friends having babies.  It's a wish list must.
B00JQ2VZXE|5|Took a month to arrive but the price is pretty cheap and looks good in person very cute true to its color
B00JWX0SL2|5|Love my kiinde products!
B00F1CPAAW|5|Our son really likes this toy. He's seven months old and currently teething, so he enjoys chewing on the ends (ears, feet, and hands) and tag. He hasn't quite figured out how to make the squeeze noise yet, but he recently discovered the rattle noise and enjoys that too.
B005OI8OCE|2|My 4.5 month old baby is finding it difficult to get a good grip of this with her mouth. My opinion is it would have been better if the diameter was smaller so that it can get into a baby's mouth without frustrating him/her.
B0075Z7ZF6|5|Great item! Shipped as expected. 5 STARS
B00PRAS3WA|5|Easy to install and keeps door shut tighr
B000058CC7|5|We love this gate, it is so easy to install.  I just got rid of our superyard gate.  That was not very good to use because you have to climb in and out of the gate.  If you have an active child like mine, you will have to go in and out a lot.  Several times i trip over it and it's not fun when you bang your legs into the gate.  It is plastic but still it hurts!  Since we just change to this hands free gate, we are so relieved.  It's worth every penny!
B000HKGDAE|2|I've been more than happy with Dr. Brown's bottles, dishwasher containers, and formula mixing pitchers... but this drying rack is a disappointment. It is sturdy enough to hold the plastic bottles well, but it is nearly impossible to reach items on the bottom rack. It really isn't worth the counter space it consumes. I would recommend buying a single-tiered or rotating rack.
B005UV0UEA|4|Easy to use, limited parts.  Would like to have a thicker pad for comfort when sleeping and sheets to fit.
B000N0SNHY|5|This is a great bottle brush. I really think that the nipple brush and the stand are great features. A+
B00N897M5Q|2|After 2 weeks of trying I have only been able to get one of the suction cups to stick, so it's basically been useless. We aren't using it because of what a pain it is to get the toys in and out while it's hanging from the wall with only one suction cup.
B000CC5EKM|3|This swaddle blanket WAS  a lifesaver or so I thought. The concept is a GREAT concept but this particular material was the worst. My baby is a 'wriggler' and always manages to wriggle her little arms out of the blanket up to her face,which is worrisome at best because once the material is that stretched then the problem becomes two-fold either her hands wake her up or the material follows her hands to her face and now we have a suffocation hazard, or sometimes her hands will find the opening in the bottom of the blanket where the 'flaps' overlap. I found the cotton knit material to be more counterproductive than helpful and HIGHLY suggest the cotton flannel. I have the microfleece, but have yet to use it. I've had minimal problems with the cotton fleece, the material isn't the stretchiest. The only real problem I have with the overall design of the blanket is the velcro. I think this blanket, especially the cotton knit, would benefit from a larger area to fasten the velcro at, therefor making it a possibility for a tighter swaddle. Also, the tabs start to 'bend out' after just once wash, making it a scratching hazard if you don't watch yourself.
B00B4DD0MC|1|Product was as described however packaging was not sufficient to protect case. Case was shattered leaving shards of plastic all over the pacifiers. They were not punctured so I am still able to use them however one of the features I like most about MAM products is that the case doubles as a sanitizer. Luckily I have other MAM cases and was able to use one of them to sanitize and store the new pacifiers.
B0013K1NXE|4|I wanted to get something I could use at that park for my son. This blanket is perfect for carrying around. It's small enough folded up and fairly large when open.<br /><br />Putting it back together is a cinch with the folding guides. Haven't washed it yet so we'll see how that goes.
B00AWLZDHM|4|I think this set is pretty great. Most nursing moms will need pads at some time and I've found that NUK pads are good quality for a great price! If your a pumping mom or even a mom who plans to Exclusively breastfeed from the tap its nice to have storage bags on hand for emergencies just in case you want to pump for when baby will be away from you. I personally do not use special wipes when I feed but I can see the benefit of having them if you need a way to quick clean on the go. Overall I would recommend this kit to new moms and use it as an experienced mom of 3.<br />I also love that with each purchase you are giving back to breast cancer research.
B004I5BTZ8|1|We, as many of the parents who reviewed this stroller, bought it because we trusted the Peg Perego name, it was stylish and seemingly functional, and folded up beautifully. I am disappointed to say that we have experienced the same design flaw in the collapsing forward wheels. They are a HAZARD!!!! Do NOT buy this stroller. Seriously!
B003U6HCGQ|3|Good Travel Mobile. Small, plays music fairly loud. Good for car seats or other travel usage. My biggest issue was with the 'clamp' portion of this product. Since it's a travel item, you would expect that the clamp is going to be pretty simple since its not tailored to any specific product. Although I've never had an issue, I always worried that the mobile would fall over because the clamp just felt so flimsy. If you're using it in a pack and play style crib or even in a car seat, it's a little unsettling to worry that it's going to fall over and hit your baby in the face. Again, it never happened to me, but the setup would make me tighten and retighten the clamp constantly when I was using it.
B003JT4HOE|5|These really helped our 10 month old son get the concept of using a spoon.  The straight spoons were too complicated and he didn't have much success with them.  Using these curved spoons rewarded his efforts and after a couple of months, he was able to use a normal spoon more easily.  We still often give him these (at 15 months old), however, because we think he does a better job getting the food into his mouth with them than with a straight spoon.  Great for yogurt or cereal or mashed food because the holes sort of grip the food.  Wish I'd gotten them even sooner!  The spoons have shown no wear and handle the dishwashe well.  The only marks on them are from his teeth where he has chewed them a little - par for the course!
B00IJJRVR4|1|I was using the hospital grade rental and switched to this when I had to return the rental. This one is so loud and it makes a loud air suctioning noise from the face plate. It also drastically reduced my milk production, I was getting 2-3 oz from each side with the rental but after using this for a month, my production went down to 1oz with both sides combined and I've had to switch to formula! I feel like the air suctioning has something to do with it. I referred to the manual and am doing everything right. I'm sad because I planned to pump for a year but baby is only 2 months old and almost nothing is coming out.
B008KK9ELS|5|Wonderful bag! Quality fabric.... only problem... magnet clasp in front pocket broke? How does that happen... I don't know.
B003Y3BH1G|5|such a great simple idea.<br />my 8 month old doesn't even need a toy at the other end.  At restaurants he simply sucks on the end of the string throughout the whole meal.  ha ha.  So leave some always in your diaper bag, even if you forget to bring a toy to attach to it, they can still entertain themselves!<br />I have one on each side of highchair.  One side has a toy, the other side is just the string.  And this keeps him occupied while I cook etc...
B004FN0ZAS|5|My first grand daughter is using the Graco Stylus 30 Quintin Travel System with the Snugride.  The parents love it.  Mom and Dad tell me how easy it is to use, set up, and transfer their precious cargo into the car seat secured system.  Wish they had equipment like this in my days.
B008B917C2|5|Was looking for something to carry my sons food in when I take him to his Nanas house. Saw these and said why not. The price was just right they arrived here on time and I loved them!
B00FZGLJ4K|5|I bought this for a baby shower gift.  The person I purchased it for had registered for it on amazon.  I was pleasantly surprised how cute it was when she opened it...it is small but she commented &#34;I love this&#34; when she saw it.  I believe it holds 2 full size baby bottles.
B00012CHFI|5|This sleeper is a must have for all new parents.  Babies sleep comfy and enclosed and helps them sleep better.  My daughter has done alot better sleeping in this secure sleeper than her small bassinet.  She feels close to us and now sleeps through the night @ 2 1/2 months.
B001V9KPBI|3|These bottles are the best thing invented! They were perfect for a long car ride, and for when our baby is in his stroller! 3 stars instead of 5 because I am back to buy more and price on the bottles has increased significantly in just two weeks!
B003ZHJ7P4|5|Our Lion's fan friends loved this gift for the new baby boy!
B00JS5JW8E|4|The color is just like it shows. The fit is just as it describes and my children love them and they are comfortable. But they feel like plastic? Are they for real was what I wondered... I will bring them to my friend who is a jeweler to see...
B0085CBA90|1|These didn't work at all for me.  I tried multiple sizes.  It was just a huge waste of money.  It wasn't any easier than without the darn flanges, and I certainly didn't get any more milk.  I pump 2-3 times a day and it was just not helpful.  It would have been more of a pain to clean the parts off.  Maybe these work for some people, but not for me.
B00D4LFDYA|5|very good deal and works great
B00IZOR49S|2|This works well, but it's a bit expensive for a single-use item. If you accidentally overtighten, you can't really adjust it either, have to cut it and throw away.
B0032G9E0G|3|Very cute, but wish the blades were a bit more pliable, instead of super hard plastic.
B004HJSQ2O|5|Cute pages, much more than expected. This went over well, wish there was just one more page for shower details and guests though!
B002NV0VM6|5|I seriously don't know how I ever pumped without this things. Two words...GAME CHANGER. Best item ever.
B006PB2H40|5|I was skeptical about this gate but I am very happy to report I love it and if the toddler trips into it she doesn't get hurt because its mesh that catches her.
B0044R7I1O|5|We had the evenflo 200 which was great but I hated 3 things:<br /><br />1. Even though the tray was removable, I always had to wash both because it didn't overlap (all kinds of food got stuck around the edges/underneath the top tray all the time). The Keekaroo tray overlaps (no more issues hooray!)<br /><br />2. There were still many places food could get stuck in the seat area and around and down all the legs and knobs. It was a huge cushion to untangle from all the lap and chest harness straps etc just to wash. If I can't keep something clean very quickly, it's only a short matter of time before it drives me insane. I'd recommend atleast getting the 300 style instead of the 200.<br /><br />3. I don't like having to adjust trays. I don't know why they can't make a little bar, or a swing tray so that you don't have to take it completely off just to remove your baby/child every time. In this chair I can actually slide my now 9 month old in and out without doing anything to the tray. Just buckle him in, unbuckle to take out. So nice.<br /><br />In short, we are doing 'baby led' eating and it can be messy, so we have the bibitec bib and the keekaroo high chair- two pricey investments that have been worth it simply because they are simple and easy to clean, making meal time a lot less of a chore. We almost got the ikea antilop but this has more worthwhile functions (and obviously beauty). When we first put our little one in this we thought something was wrong because it positions them so high! But in fact he has a lot more freedom of movement with his arms and seems tremendously more comfortable than he did in other more traditional high chairs). I actually got tired of cleaning the seat cushion every meal and washing all the time so I put that away and stuck on some cute little animal bath anti-slip stickers to the wood (from amazon) - this keeps him from sliding around, he still seems just as comfortable and I can scrub them and the seat in one easy wipe.<br /><br />Things I wish were different:<br /><br />The bar between the legs should be smooth. I hate how food gets in it (it's like a little bowl waiting for food). Still easy to clean but I have no idea why it's designed like this. If you hover your mouse you can see that it's a hollow plastic bar.<br /><br />The bar just above the foot rest makes cleaning that area very annoying because my sponge cannot fit under that bar and I always get stuff stuck just under that while wiping and you need a thin towel on hand to push it back out.<br /><br />Wish the tray did release with a one handed push button on the front like many highchairs. It has a bit of an absurd and non ergonomic way it attaches, needing both hands. Lucky for me I haven't had to mess with it because my little one slips in and out carefully without needing to move the tray. This point could have really made me hate this high chair if I hadn't worked around it, because it is not very easy to get this tray on and off.<br /><br />There is no adjustment for height - it will be a certain height for baby, toddler, adult ..<br />There is no adjustment for reclining. This limits it to 6+ month babies. Not an issue for us but could be for some. I don't see the need for the little booster seat at all - if you are waiting until they are 6 months like mine he sat just fine in this without it.<br /><br />You cannot remove the straps to clean them, you need to spot clean them on the high chair.<br /><br />You obviously can't fold this up and take it to a restaurant or hide it in a closet. But then, it's too beautiful to hide. And hiding and taking things out 3x a day takes time. I hate wasting time. Eventually you will just let it sit out. And you can always get those table attaching chairs if you're on the go a lot, or pads to put over restaurant high chairs if you're worried about germs and safety.<br /><br />Things I like:<br /><br />Highly recommended for baby led feeding/weaning due to ease of cleaning. I agree after using it.<br /><br />The obvious beauty - it looks great in our kitchen. Really beautiful. I always liked the oxo brand but this is just as nice if not better.<br /><br />No silly cup holders or complicated trays or toy things that just get in the way. Get that twirly suction toy here on amazon and a suction bowl for soupy foods and you're good to go! A flat tray really is a beautiful thing.<br /><br />Sturdy, still easy to move around (if you are confused whether you need wheels on your highchair the answer is noooo .. they are almost completely pointless. Wheels would only be handy if there were 4 and they pivoted but no highchair is made that way (and probably for safety reasons). This highchair slides and moves easier than my evenflo with wheels).<br /><br />Haven't had issues with our 9 month old trying to get out yet, the straps have worked great. Time will tell, perhaps we'll have to double them up around him like another reviewer mentioned as he gets older and gains more 'Houdini' skills.<br /><br />It isn't always the brightest idea to get something that boasts being many things, but I can see myself using this as a booster chair and regular little desk chair for him as he gets older. It matches our table and we're short on chairs so this is a functional benefit.<br /><br />In summary, there still isn't a high chair out there that has everything figured out in one chair unfortunately. But this seems to be the only one on the market with the combination of features we were looking for. I've learned: Clean ease and comfort for baby are the #1 things you need in a high chair. 'Easy clean' is not easy unless there is no fabric. Comfort is subjective to baby - you don't want them hating meal time. Stick with simplicity.
B00JXR2ULS|4|Mimi gave it a 5 because she loved its softness and design idea.  Mom gave it a 3 out of 5 because her wiggle worm can wiggle out of it pretty easily when she changes him.  For other applications she really likes it.
B00D3TPGB8|2|The catch/cup portion is great.  I thought I would love the top, but when you wash the bib, the top part takes a while to dry.  If we use it for breakfast, it's not dry by lunchtime (same with lunch to dinner).  So... consider buying two.<br /><br />I have also used the bibs that were all the harder plastic, including around the neck.  The dry very quickly and it is more difficult for the baby to undo the clasp.  My daughter only has to tug slightly and the velcro falls right off.  I can't recommend this bib unless you plan to replace it often.
B00NO3E5LA|4|We purchased this 7 piece set as a gift for a baby shower.  The colors are perfect for a boy or a girl! The bag has plenty of pockets and is made of material that should easily wipe clean. The smaller bags are perfect for pacifiers, milk storage, and bottles. There are two things that are not so great about this set. First...the divider that sits inside of the bag to supposedly make it easier to organize whatever you put in there is just very thin material...not sturdy enough to hold anything upright.  And second...the changing pad is the same thin material. Neither one of them will last very long.  Otherwise...this is a very cute bag for the price!
B003JJX2IG|5|Absolutely great product. I LOVE these!!!!
B0045I6IA4|4|A binky is a binky!
B004FLL7HK|3|good stroller  but the handles are really short and Im only 5;4' and I have to ben to push it. Otherwise its ok..
B0000A1O7P|1|I returned this hook-on chair.  I was unable to attach it to my kitchen table or breakfast counter.  The concept is good but it does work.  Very disappointing!
B00MTJX07A|3|Overall I liked this stroller, but I expected it to be a little nicer.  For example the mechanism to change the reclining back was a little hard to operate while the baby was in it.  It also does NOT have a foot rest for the baby, which I think will make it uncomfortable as the baby gets older.
B0009V0SVG|4|I like this tub I bought my daughter after she outgrew her infant tub. I was looking for a tub ring, but found this at a local store.  The first time I put my daughter in it I knew it was more then worth the 10 dollars I paid for it.  She had plenty of room to grow into and really enjoyed being able to splash herself and me as well.
B00JQYT6L0|5|I feel very safe using this item.  Our grandbaby came for the holidays and this worked well in the foldable crib we have.
B0001WAO9E|5|My son had one when he was born, and now, almost 9 years later, a friend of mine was having a child and I went and searched a lot of stores and found it here. Love these bears. In my experience, the sounds these bears put out drastically help the child sleep comfortably every night. And as they grow, it becomes a comfort item if you keep the bear with them. I loved this bear and so too does my friend. Both of our children have slept all night every night since birth. Now, I know this is just speculative, that it is due just solely to the bear, but it almost seems like it. Like I said, we love this 'womb bear'.<br /><br />I have looked at other 'womb sound' plush toys, but found them too stiff or weird looking, like I wouldn't want to take the item out of the house if I owned it, which defeats the purpose of comforting the child with the sounds if you only use it once in awhile. This bear is soft and no choking hazards. Even the stitching over the nose is soft. The blanket is removable so if there are any accidents, it can be easily washed and taken care of. The sound box fits into its slot, and easily removable for change of batteries, or complete removal due to child's age.<br /><br />I did and will recommend this product to anyone with a child on the way. Best day to start the acclamation into the world is by this bear on day one hour one.
B00MHUCOVO|5|My son loves to get his diaper changed on this. We call it his &#34;pillow top mattress&#34;
B00KIDTGP4|5|Great decals.  Very easy to use.  They are easy to move too if you want to change the placement.
B005QUQC2O|4|Good traditional manual winding product with pleasing music for infants. Last's 2-3 Min's  per wind. We have used it for 6 weeks so far. Other automated music ones have poor speakers compared to Iphone/Ipads.
B000BKXCCM|5|I love the Pre-Natal and Newborn Baby Education System.  It is a true blessing to have a system in place that I know will enhance my baby's development even before he is born.  The music and Bible versus are also relaxing for me and my two-year-old.  We have really enjoyed the CDs.  I use to work in the field of adoption and wish that I would have had this resource at my disposal during that time period.
B0006HBS1M|4|if you have no more choice, that's fine
B0014J0W8G|5|These are great.  They are easy enough for adults not to battle through the security and for toddlers not to open the cabinets.
B000U5FOT2|1|Wanted to use the Superyard 3 in 1 to block of a stair banister and stair way to the basement.  Door width is way too narrow for regular travel through the gate especially carrying laundry etc. up and down through the gate.  I don't think Amazon clearly posted the gate width but it is narrow.  We almost had to turn sideways just to fit through and we are 5'8&#34; @150 lbs.
B011Y9FEWY|1|This is so unsafe and totally illegal in the U.S.
B00DSOPFD2|5|We have the builders grade tub and shower, this hooks nicely on the side.  Holds much more than expected and everything dries quickly.  No mold issues, would recommend.
B00004D3EU|5|This is the best tub I ever bought. I am using it with my 3 month old and a 18 month old. I like the locking seat guard and suction cups on the bottom of the tub. Definitely worth every penny. Safe for baby and toddler.
B001PVAXZK|5|I love these bottles, they're the only ones my baby will take. She's never had a problem switching from breast to bottle either.
B00GSP5D94|5|My daughter sleeps well in these.  She is 4 months at 14 lbs.  They are slightly big, so she has room to grow...and she will in no time.
B00EUV2BSE|5|My great granddaughter loves this jumper, & maybe more importantly so does her mother (our granddaughter).  She really likes the variety of things to do.
B00QIWVPJE|5|I love these!  I am not your typical mom purchasing these, I am actually getting them for my six year olds!  Both of my girls have sensory issues, one more than the other.  One also has difficulties with anxiety.  These issues cause them to chew.  A lot.  Clothes are ruined, arms are bruised or even scarred and more!<br /><br />I am part of a mom group with lots of moms of infants.  They tout the use of Baltic Amber for teething pain and other discomfort.  I began researching the use of baltic amber in older kids and wanted to give it a try.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  My opinions aren't swayed in any way.<br /><br />I gave these to my girls, one got the necklace, which I shortened a bit (easy to do at the clasp!) and she loves it.  It looks like she's wearing &#34;Grown up&#34; jewelry and her friends all like it, yet it provides her with relief from the need to chew.  Her clothes and arms thank you!  (as does Mom!)<br /><br />The other, I took the baltic amber necklace, which is probably the appropriate size for a young toddler (please measure!) and I wrapped it around her wrist twice.  She loved that it matched the baltic amber necklace on a baby I was babysitting for.  She felt the colors were really pretty and it was comfortable for her to wear.  It may be coincidence, it is hard to judge these things, but for the few days she's been wearing it I am noticing much less wetness around the necks of her shirts (from chewing/sucking on it) and she hasn't complained once of a stomach ache- which usually happens a few times a day.  (we believe the stomach aches are anxiety induced- medical reasons are ruled out).<br /><br />Overall both are such a great addition for my girls- much more natural ways to help them function, without drawing attention to their needs!
B006UKL5YE|5|gft
B009TCEEUW|5|Super cute design, and hasn't shrunk so it still fits.
B00WVUX06S|5|This is the perfect size for toddler toothbrushes and I love that it doubles as a rinse cup. Such a cute and fun design and easily cleaned in the dishwasher.
B0073JD2VU|5|However, the directions were a bit confusing.  Therefore I have two holes in my lazy susan cabinet from pre drilling!<br /><br />I assume that like most households, the one I grew up in did not put cabinet locks of any kind on.  Since we plan to be a resource family for the state we will, I also assume, be required to.  I hope so!
B00073HJG8|5|Holds all my stuffed animals of every size. Very lightweight, yet strong netting. I naively used command strips to hold it up and the strips were strong enough, so as long as you nail the hooks in the wall, you'll be fine.
B00EUV2BSE|3|First, I did not buy this off of Amazon. I bought it at a local store. After much consideration, I finally was won over by this one! I read and read reviews. I am really glad that I got this one. My 4 month daughter LOVES it! It is perfect for her on the lowest level. I love the high back! She is really entertained by all the toys! She loves the piano and the spin toy! One major con for me and pretty much the only one! Was putting it together! Only the entertainment part! I was doing this by myself with a 3 year old running around trying to help me and jumping all on the boxes. When it came to securing the parts down, I personally could not do it myself! I do not have a whole lot of hand strength. I tried to secure them properly as best as I could! The seat snapped down on top of them helps from them getting out! The only one that could really come loose is the piano. The sun toy and the spin toy have a snap thing (sorry not sure of proper term) that snaps down securely! All of them need that and that only! Instead of the turn lock dial. Will never take this thing apart ever! Also, the directions could have been a little bit more clear on some parts, but still pretty easy to understand.
B0028H3ACS|5|I'm not sure who loves this Wubby the best...me or my baby daughter.  The weight of the kitty cat helps keep the pacifier from falling out, which allows me some interruption-free sleep at night.    Now that she is a little older (almost 4 months), she likes to play with it, and strokes her hands over it while she is sucking the pacifier.  When it does fall out of her mouth, she tries to put it back in, although at this point she usually ends up sucking on a leg or tail instead.  :)  This little guy might seem a tad expensive for what it is, but I would buy another one in a heartbeat if this one got lost.    The kitty cat is very well sewn.  My baby tugs and pulls at the legs, and the stitching is holding up perfectly.  I'm not sure exactly how the Soothie pacifier is attached, but it is still attached after about 3 months of use.  I've also tossed it in the washing machine a couple of times (in a mesh bag) and drip dried it.
B004K6LMXY|5|Aside from the brush shedding a few brissels the first couple uses, this is a great brush and comb. Very cute.
B00B9ZHLRU|3|It's hard to get all the food out of here.  It's not that easy to fill either.  But, it's well made and will last a long time.  I prefer the clear pouches instead though.  This isn't as user friendly as I was hoping it would be.
B007FRAJAC|1|My son had an accident in his carseat once with this in and it was completely soaked as well as the carseat itself! Better for gathering dropped snacks!
B007UK1CF0|5|i work at a hospital where we use these and I was so excited to get one since we are currently expecting. I have yet to use it as I'm not due for a couple months, but it came in the time frame it said it would and we are getting ready to set it up in advance for the baby!
B003VZO0UM|3|We didn't think that this car seat was the best for our newborn son for the following reasons:  1.  The straps didn't tighten together well (one was always looser than the other)  2.  There is stitching where the newborn's head goes that is scratchy and uncomfortable (although it looks cute because it is an elephant patch).  We ended up placing a washcloth there to protect our son's head.  3.  The handle is slightly difficult to adjust and makes creaking noises (so it's harder to transfer a sleeping infant from car to house).  4.  The canopy doesn't rotate all the way forward so if you're using it in a stroller system, you need a back-up method to block the sunlight.    The pros are:  1.  We didn't have problems installing it.  2.  The 5 point harness system clicked together easily.  3.  It was a cinch to click into the base or stroller.
B005WHQKHS|5|We love the cup holders!  We haven't had it long, only a couple of weeks, but so far so good.
B0045I6IA4|5|These are a little blessing while having a newborn!  Our daughter takes these very well.  They don't sit against their little faces, so moisture doesn't get trapped.  Sad these are only for 0-3 months since our daughter turns 3 months tomorrow.  Hopefully the next step up Avent pacifiers work just as well.
B00MS9VTFQ|1|Our highchair just arrived and the seat was torn? The fabric seems extremely thin and cheapy.
B001CWR3Q4|5|I absolutely love these sheets and so does my daughter! They are so soft and warm. The pink is very pretty and the sheets fit great. I don't have any issues with the elastic expanding too much. I always put them in the dryer on low heat using the delicate setting. I also have 4 sets of them, so I swap them out fairly often. These are a great buy!
B00LDWU3AQ|5|Worked as they should.
B005WWIJEK|5|This is the perfect size bag for two swimsuits. I got this for using to and from the local swimming pool. I will be able to use it when we go on vacation and want to swim that last day after the bags are all packed.
B00HH0G3VQ|4|This swing is everything I expected. It folds up which saves a decent amount of space. I choose this swing because of the 25 lb weight limit. My chunky baby is about 21 and it swings just fine with her in it. It's soft and comfy. I would recommend it.
B000056JIE|5|Comfortable, thin, and absorbent.
B0035IQ2RE|5|good
B009TO9VJY|4|The colors are a bit more primary than pastel but its really not a problem. I do wish there was a bit more consistant color selection. For instance, I received 2 pink and 11 blue in the package.
B00GCYTNYM|4|Wish it came a little smaller, but it is great just the same. Very cheap and got it at the right time that I expected
B00EI1ML6S|5|was here before date  ...i love it..
B000BK8OVG|5|Love this!
B000QGCKPG|3|It was a joke gift for my son when they had their first baby.  I think he saved it to regift.
B007A2ZSZ8|5|This is great! Keeps our fridge closed and is easy for an adult to use.
B000RFG066|1|I thought they had a soft spout. The spout is not soft at all!!!! And of course you notice after opening the package so now I can not return. It also took about 2 weeks to get these!
B00DYOQKP8|5|Great bottles!  My son is older, I'd say these are meant for 9-12 months +  Reasonable price too.
B00A3P0ZBG|5|This is a great stroller. I am so happy after researching different light-weight stroller that I went with the Inglesina. The larger umbrella sold me. The stroller is so light and easy to maneuver with one hand. It does take me 2 hands to fold up which isn't a problem for me. The only downside is the basket. I suggest getting a cardboard for it or something. I also wish it had a cup holder. But that was an easy fix. It is so nice that it doesn't take up lots of space folded up like my Travel stroller. My 11 month old loves riding in it too.
B006ZISTTA|4|Nice high chair, but wheels do not turn easily.
B002LARFR8|5|Soft and easy to wash. I use it to wipe my baby's face and during baths all the time. Good buy.
B00005CARW|5|This is the best invention!, so easy to use, they are disposable, clean and perfect to pack. I wish the boxes came with more inserts.
B0006HBS1M|4|Does the job. Well made. Smooth pumping action. The flanges are replaceable if you need a bigger size. I hate the little membrane, though. It's only a matter of time before I lose it. (Which I'd why I avoided Medela for my electric pump.) But this is good for a backup or quickie pumping session.
B00440D022|1|The three ducks that I got look different - they each have a cartoonish-looking purple snorkeling mask on instead of being the classic yellow duck featured in the picture for this product.  I'm very disappointed.
B00698WLWM|5|My son is a big fan of Spider-Man and this is best gift for boys at this age.<br /> Having all these items packed in one basket saved time and effort of searching of all items and packing them.<br />I simply got it ready nicely arranged and wrapped!
B0035LLG2W|5|Total life saver.  Easy to use.  Heats bottle quickly and evenly.
B000066665|5|We went on a cruise for our holiday and so I took this along for our baby to bath in. He loved it and it was perfect as it was small and fitted easily into the luggage. He felt secure in the bath and could relax and play with his toys. He loved it so much we are now using it at home. It has been one of the best baby things we have purchased.
B00LIUKQXW|2|its great for a 2 year old. However, it doesn't hold much water and the elephant doesn't squirt well
B000J6CDY6|5|I purchased this for my newborn son and it helped me out on those cranky nights when he just couldn't get to sleep. When I first read about the product I was a little confused on how the song of a whale could help my child sleep, but it grabs his attention even if he's crying and calms him down. I love the fact that it plays for 45 minutes and the various noises. We love this product so much that I purchased one for my friend who is about to have a baby. In addition to the sounds, my son just loves to play with the sheep.
B000V88HJM|1|I bought this nail clipper to trim nails for my 2 months old. This clipper broker after 3 months of use. Do not recommend and definitely will not be repurchasing. Waste of money!!
B002U378JQ|4|Covers our car seat perfectly, and my son loves the Elmo pattern.
B002PEZCU2|3|I really love the design on these and the colors are beautiful.  But I have tons of canvases in my house, and none of them look like these ... the canvas is loose on the stretcher frames - it definitely wasn't stretched properly onto the frame.  Once these are on the wall, most people probably won't notice it but I know it will drive me nuts.  These aren't super-expensive, so I guess you get what you pay for.  But I expected the canvases to be stretched correctly.
B00FSKX266|3|Hoping it to be better my newborn cries after being placed in the carrier. But it was a great idea but didn't work for me....
B005I19LOC|2|the distance it gives is not reliable at all.  i moved maybe 2/3 what they said it is capable of and it kept having to find the signal it doesn't working more than it does.  Also it is not very good at picking up signal outside of the house, not to mention it freezes for a while before it tells you its not working so you look in on what appears to be a sleeping baby and next glance they are hysterical.  the battery never lasted.  i can pull it off with a full charge and after 5 minutes it will give the low battery warning.<br /><br />The buttons to move the monitor from the hand held device broke within a month of use, I'd day I'd used the buttons maybe twice.<br /><br />The video is fine, the audio it picks up really well but i bought it for the distance so i could go outside and work in yard or mess with dogs while baby sleeps and it is useless for that.  for what it is capable of i think i should have saved my money and turned down the volume.<br /><br />all in all very disappointed but what are you going to do.
B000056OUO|1|It's useless. The one I bought came broken into pieces and Amazon refunded me the full amount. Thanks to Amazon.<br />This so inferior and cannot hold much. Nowadays I believe no one is using tiny soap bottles or cream bottles as it's cheaper to buy the big ones. This cannot hold any of those.
B00ALOT55Q|4|It's containing my toddler so far. My only complaint is the gate door. It's hard to align. We don't bother with it.
B000ZYM8SS|3|Although this rattle got some great reviews, my son did not seem to be very interested in it.  The shape does make it easy to grab, so he does pick it up occasionally but it just doesn't seem to catch his eye or hold his interest.  I think it would have been better if both sides were clear where the bead are instead of mirrored on one side.  This is a really inexpensive rattle, so I didn't mind trying it out.  Maybe as he gets older he'll be more interested in it.
B000A88JZA|5|Thank goodness these can be ordered! I put the original ones in the dishwasher, top rack. During the cycle, they fell off and melted on the coil in the bottom of the dishwasher! Needless to say, I was desperate to get a replacement and was so glad I didn't have to order all the pieces and accessories.
B000HBMVO0|5|My sister asked for this to go with her baby stroller.  She loves it.
B004B7NXRK|4|This is great to have to free up your hands to get some stuff done while pumping. The smaller Flanges fit right in but the openings must be stretched a bit to fit the larger flanges. I haven't had any problems and the material does give enough to get them through. Overall a great purchase. I would encourage moms to be to pick one up. I was a 38DD and the Large fits pretty good.
B0034JHDHM|5|Works great!
B007E7XEKK|4|This is a very sleek and stylish baby bed! I love the outlined details of each piece!<br />The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star is because there is a large gash in the front inside corner of the front panel. It IS on the inside so until we convert it to a bigger bed, no one will notice it.
B0018Z8CN8|5|I bought this as a secondary tub for when my son is visiting with my mom, and like it better than the fancy tub he has here at home. I like the angle, it's lightweight, and easy to maneuver.
B00B5CBIBW|1|i hate this thing it has adds so much of air in the bottle that my son doesnt even want to drink the milk anymore from this. money wasted for sure
B001ODAY5I|5|Thank you.
B002WB2D78|4|The kids like them.  My 4 year old, new to a booster seat has trouble buckling the seatbelt when the pillow is installed, so we leave it off, with the promise that we will put in on whenever we take a longer trip.  My 6 year old has no problem so we leave it on all of the time. It does seem to look bigger in the picture than it really is.
B00VAUJXQ6|5|Few inches measured the box?
B000056OWC|2|This item is really only useful for newborns through 2-3 months.  My little one (8lbs-3ozs at birth) had out grown this tub by the time she was 21/2 months.  She would dangle her little leg over the edge, or get her toes wedged into the blue arm rest.  The suctions cups didn't always work. It holds very little water. It was a struggle to use.<br />I brought the Sure Comfort Tub a few days ago, and it has change bath time for my little one.  Bath time is more enjoyable for her and far easier on me now. I love the snuggly net, and although she's too big for the net I still use the padded head rest. I love the safty feature that warns you if the water is too hot.  I love the fact that I can still use this tub as my daughter grows into her toddler years.  If I had it to do all over again this tub would have been my first and only choice.
B005EJWQIQ|5|As advertized
B000LPZTQY|5|Really, Really good product. my wife wakes up to feed our son and pumps right after. This pump is quiet enough that i don't know about her middle of the night pumping until  she mentions it the following day.
B00RF62XF2|4|I was looking at other brands of this dirty diaper holder -- and ended up going with this one because of cost and shipping. It was here right on time (if not earlier than expected) and is EXACTLY what I needed. Couldn't be happier.
B000056J5C|5|I love this product because it makes packed lunches so organized & easy.  I labeled each part with my label maker to help find any lost pieces.  I also like that the food items are not mashed, and my child did not finish it still looks good enough to eat when I pick him up.
B00IAIXT2U|5|This baby book is adorable. Totally worth the price. It has a lot of information to fill out and room for pictures.
B009IXH54Y|2|Wouldn't buy again. Not soft at all.
B0015TM0M6|5|Thing thing WORKS!     We've have had it since my son our an infant and he never really liked us poking around his nose, but it got the job done.   Now he is a toddler it is the best thing ever. He understands what it does. I stand him in front of the mirror and he lets me get rid of his stuff nose without a fuss.    Plus, it is easy to clean. The clear suction tube comes off, as does the the plastic part with 2 arms inside that sucks the snot out (it connects to the top bulb part) and then of course the clear container that catches all of that ickyness. So I haven't a clue why people say you can't clean it... it is super easy.  We also like that we can see exactly what come out of his nose. I run it under water every time so the snot doesn't dry to it.    I also like that it doesn't go \\"up\\" his nose. The fat bulb part creates the perfect suction, then just the small top is inserted into the nose. Sometimes with the blue bulb's he'd move and it would get shoved up his nose which he didn't appropriate.    I have only had the blue bulb and a worthless bulb that came with the red cross kit, so I don't have any experience with other \\"tools\\", but I like this so much I didn't see the need to get anything else.
B00333M14Y|5|Best carseat I have and we have a Graco and Evenflo for my husband's car, not that those are bad, I just like the comfort and durability of the Britax.  I feel very safe with my daughter in it and plan on buying another for my 5 month old soon
B00AHVR94W|5|Great design, easily fitted and nicely secured to isofix brackets
B004EWG4ZA|5|I bought this mattress to go with a crib I purchased on Amazon.  It arrived on time and did not have any strong odors or undesirable smell.  It fits great in the crib and seems to be of great quality.
B00G1PBVMO|4|I own a size 4 and put my 3.5 week old into our sling today.  At first I didn't think she was going to fit. She is a little over 10 lbs. It was snug but once I got her in there she passed right out. I am very petite- 5'2&#34;, 130 (105 pre-preg) and 34 b cup--- I can only see this sling working once my baby is old enough to sit in the sling on my hip. She fits now and probably will for a few more lbs. I do have a very long baby too, so that could factor in. I will also say that once she was in, it felt very secure. There wasn't a ton of extra fabric and I liked that. I could squat down and not feel like I had to hold onto her.
B00KDKKD1I|5|Chris takes extreme pride in customer satisfaction! Incredible service, wonderful experience, great product. The pillow is perfect. Chris sent us a less-fill pillow free of charge after the first one was too fluffy for my son, and he followed up and cared if we were happy with the pillow. I cannot say enough good things about this company. The pillow is perfect now. I think most toddlers around age 2-3 would prefer the less-fill pillow the company offers. Hopefully this will help others looking at these reviews.
B001OC5UMQ|4|It actually comes with &#34;caps&#34; that you screw into the wall to hold the tension rod. this wasn't what I wanted and just put it up without the caps. Took some time to get it secure to where my dog couldn't gradually dislodge it. It does have a gap on the wall side, at least using it without the extension on an opening about 33&#34; wide and my cocker spaniel did get his head caught in it for a minute, but he hasn't done that since. So, I'd think it wouldn't work at all for small dogs and maybe some medium dogs. I believe if you don't have to extend the screws/tension rod part of it out too far to fit your space that gap is significantly reduced and would eliminate some of the problem.
B000056HK2|5|Love the changing pad, works wonderfully........  For the people that don't know the measurements.........  Since the covers that are suggested to be sold with it are 16\\" X 32\\" wouldn't ya think that the size of the pad would be about the same?  They are, just so you know....
B006ZVV0P2|5|Work great at protecting your seatback from little kicking feet, good price, what more could you want from a seat back protector?
B00HAZSL5O|5|I got this as a gift for my daughter and son-in-law. They love it! They're planning on going with a blue/brown moose them for their little one due in August! It was a huge hit!
B0013FGWD0|2|It doesn't stay put but when it did, the baby would not get stuck in between the rails. But this was rare.If I had a choice, I would not buy it.
B00005BSM0|3|I was really excited to get this tub.  I love the cushion insert because my daughter can lay with her head out of the water and I have 2 hands free.  However, the plug is extremely difficult to get in, and having to remove the cushion every time to ring it out and dry is inconvenient.  Also, my daughter is 4 months and 18lbs, and I can't imagine her still being in this tub at 2 years.  But for now, we'll stick with it.
B001GQ4CL0|3|As reviewed by K. Canfield, I would agree this is really a solid product with one major shortcoming.  The gate to this pen is of extremely poor design. It is a \\"lift & latch\\" design(see Canfield's description), but due to the all wood construction, imperfections allow the gate to become easily dislodged while installed and while opening.  Our 9 month old son makes quick work of this if something is not placed in front of it.  At first I thought our floor was not level but confirmed in fact it was. Next we thought, perhaps it was because we weren't using all of the panels, but this too proved to not matter.      Our only option now is to replace the gate with the solid section we are currently not using or modify the hinge and latch by drilling and installing metal pins and a spring latch.    It would be nice to see Aosom provide a fix or provide feedback to this issue.  Otherwise this is a nice product, far better than the plastic equivalents.
B00A5UAU7S|1|My straps installed 5-6 years ago are falling apart in my hands- please check your straps!!!
B00004TFLB|5|Many years of use. Our daughter loves it and she's teaching our son to love it. Great sound quality and very fair price!
B00AHVR7ZI|5|Love the latch! With a 1 year old sister, my son had to climb into our Edge and get into his seat by himself. The latch holds the seat in place while he climbs in. It also keeps the seat in tact when he's not in the car which protects all of us if it would become a projectile in an accident!<br /><br />My son can still fall asleep using the headrests but can see around them just fine. Would definitely buy again in a heartbeat!<br /><br />We tried the Evenflo $89 one created specifically for toys r us (with lights) and it was awful!!!  Took it back in 24 hours. The arm rests were weird placement and his elbows were in the cup holder!  Don't buy that one!!<br /><br />The graco booster has a perfectly placed cup holder (not in the way) and a little cubbie for secret toys. Great buy!!
B0026P4O5E|4|I absoutly love this crib teether! I had such a hard time finding something that would work for my crib. I didnt want the hard plastic cover- cuz they dont fit all cribs (I have a convertiable crib- fits and still have plenty extra material, so I am sure it would fit other cribs with wide rails), I was afraid the gummi cover would peel my finish off if it came loose, and I did not the one with velcro cuz I saw many reviews where their child found out how to take that off (which my son being 11 months and loves to figure that stuff out, would have for sure). I was so excited to find this style when I came across- I was worried cuz no one had reviewed it and thats why I am today for you- BUY IT AND LOVE IT!! Its perfect, machine washable, shoft, water- proof barrier so won't hurt your crib, and best of all your child wont be able to take it off(unless you have some sort of genius who knows how to untie, I double knotted just to be safe :) If he starts to try to go for the short rail I will be buying the smaller one to- PERFECT SOLUTION FOR TEETHING BABIES!!! Don't waste your money on anything else! My only wish was that it came in cotton, not just fleece- otherwise would be perfect score![[ASIN:B0020C0Z88 Trend Lab Front Rail Guard Collection]]
B0097D4ZMU|5|My wife and I have been using our phones for the baby's soother, and that gets to be a hassle. This thing gets plenty loud, and offers different noises and is pretty durable (we have dropped it from a few feet in air a couple of times).
B001BWT5IE|5|No smell (and I have a good nose...).  Great price.  Works better than Diaper Genie.
B00LYCR718|5|These washcloths were purchased for adult use.  I was originally looking for a 100% cotton washcloth to replace some worn ones I have.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to order a pack of the Brooklyn Bamboo Baby Washcloths.  When I received the shipment, unfortunately I had a rough place on my finger that snagged and pulled the threads on one of the washcloths.  I went ahead and placed all of the washcloths in the washer and dryer so that my husband and I could use them that night.  When I took them out of the dryer, the snagged place was not even noticeable.  The washcloths were very soft.  I was able to soap up the washcloth for my shower without having to continue re-soaping the washcloth as I had previously had to do with the old washcloths.  This turned out to be a side benefit for saving soap. My husband and I are both very satisfied with the purchase.
B00C9O6YLE|3|I registered for this, thinking the organizer above the changing pad would give us more access to wipes/diapers in a small space on a small changing table.  It's a neat concept, the changing pad is nice enough, but I didn't like how much room it took up when you positioned it above the changing pad.  It might work for a newborn, but I can't imagine having a 6-9 month old and not knocking into it ALL the time.  I'm returning it, and getting some sort of shelf for above or caddy to hang from the side of the changing table.
B002ZB8298|5|This baby monitor does all that it claims it does. It ensures that your baby is breathing and moving and the sound quality is very clear, with the baby sounds sufficiently amplified. Well worth the money.
B000MVQBG4|4|Holds lots of toys and allows them to drain.  Also gives some play surface during the bath.  Easy to move around to get out of the way when daughter wants to swim
B000SNGR0Q|5|This is an excellent product!  I've always dreaded having kids parties at home.  I usually send the kids outside to drink but with this juice box/pouch holder I don't have to worry.  But don't wait to have a party to use this product.  It is for everyday use.  You can tell this was created by a mom!
B007RVSP0M|5|I purchased these to protect the handlebar on my Britax stroller because I had read a lot of feedback that the foam damages easily due to the way the stroller collapses. I bought 2 sets to cover the entire bar and so far it's working very well for us. No complaints and I love that I can also wash as needed!
B005VKG32S|5|They are adorable.
B00IVNDXD4|5|Cute bath toy for kids.
B000MEB3GE|5|My daughter really liked this product.  When she was sleep deprived, it helped her remember what time,etc.
B002UD65ZE|4|Maybe this is because I didn't give it much thought but it certainly does repel liquid but the liquid runs off it onto something that will absorb it.
B000MRGMSA|5|My baby is happy.She is comfortable with her new nipples.I recommend this product pretty much，Price is also good . a
B00MYRL4L6|3|Nothing special, very thin sheet set. Not much too comforter either. I was expecting better materials for $59.
B007A2ZOP2|5|I don't have kids, but I do have several ugly, scratched up outlets in my apartment from the previous tenant.  I was looking for crisp white, stylish plugs to compliment my pure white face plates instead of going to the expense of hiring an electrician to replace the sockets.  These plug covers were exactly what I was looking for!
B001JQMGBU|5|My daughter was 4 months old when I ordered this.  She was starting to get bored with the mats and bouncy seat. This toy keeps her so entertained!  She loves that she can turn herself to the different toys.  She isn't quite heavy enough to use the jump pad part of it, it won't go down under her body weight, but she really doesn't care.  She jumps anyway.  The only issue I had when putting it together was that one of the little feet that keeps it from wobbling (which is optional, they fold up to allow the toy to wobble) would not fit in it's little slot.  No big deal, my daughter enjoys the wobble!
B00L9NR672|5|I ordered this diffuser simply on the basis of so many great reviews, and WOW!  I was NOT disappointed.  I absolutely love the colors displayed and how quiet the unit is.  If you are looking for a diffuser, look no further.  Simple to use, easy to clean and an automatic shut off after 4 hours.  It's worth the money!  Love love love it!!
B00I88JNZY|5|I purchased these for my son's crib at daycare. The sheets are soft and have held up after several washes.
B0010SZZJC|5|My baby is 6 month old and is not able to sit all by herself very well but she is bored of lying or being hold all the time. I should buy the baby seat earlier so that both she and I could be free for a while earlier. Furthermore, she is able to sit quite well without support after using the seat for a couple of weeks. I love the seat, so does the baby.
B002OL1UB6|5|I got these inserts in the beginning of 2011. I don't know about the post below that said they are thin and different from the ones that come with the diaper...the ones I got are actually the same thing that came with the diaper...thick and great quality... my baby is a heavy wetter, so at night time she needs two inserts to last her 8 hours of sleep... I find them great! Super absorbent! :D so unless they changed since the beginning of the year, you can buy with confidence :) ... also any problems you can always talk with fuzzibunz, their customer service is great! :D
B00HG694X0|5|Absolutely love this!  I got this because I wanted our baby to stay cool in the summer months, but didn't want to put him to sleep in just a onesie or a long-sleeve, footed sleeper.  This is a great wearable blanket that allows air to move freely around his body, but keep him warm enough as well.  I like that it has shorter sleeves and has a great double zipper that you can either zip down from the top (to put it on) or zip up from the bottom (for quick middle-of-the-night diaper changes).  It has a cute pattern with a variety of sports balls and the large size fits my 10 mo old (24lbs) with room to grow.  I would definitely recommend this item and plan to purchase another!
B006YNM3W0|3|These were great but only fit my baby for 2 weeks and she was small 6lbs 8 ounces at birth
B002MY3HBQ|5|Love this! It's perfect portions, easy to clean and can be put in freezer. Once frozen food can be popped out easily
B0049M9OY8|4|Overall: I've had this product since the day my daughter was born. In the beginning, we used it for any laying down &#34;play&#34; time or when she was napping right next to us (on the couch, for example). She very quickly became strong enough to move her head side-to-side in it (but she has always had a strong neck), so now that she's 8 weeks, she does sleep with it at night. She sleeps very comfortably and peacefully with her head turned slightly to one side or the other.<br /><br />Design: I do wish two things of the pillow. 1. That it would be thinner all the way around so as not to lift her head as much (just enough to prevent the flat spot) and 2. That they offered a satin/silky type material so it wouldn't rub off her very dark hair.
B00000J0FX|2|While the rattle structure is as pictured, the one I received is only black and white and not full of different colors as pictured - a bit disappointing and not as fun for a baby.
B00GRY0ZYE|5|Our 2012  Ford Edge has very wide seats, and these kick mats cover the entire width of the seat, are sufficiently long, and the straps had plenty of length and adjustability to fit around the front of the seats.  The lower strap fits down in the seat crease and does not provide any noticeable bump or uncomfortableness when sitting in the seat.
B000069EXQ|5|I don't know why some people don't like the micro-fleece version. It is a nice sleep sack for the winter time. Maybe a little bit too warm if you set the room temp too high.
B004IZWQYQ|5|All the kids, aged one and a half, three, and five years, were thrilled.  A big hit.  The fact that it came with 3 balls was more important than I ever considered. :)
B001L1RBYK|5|I looked for a gate for a hallway spanning 50\\". As you will see in your research there are not a lot of choices, and each of those available had design drawbacks. I needed to keep a new puppy from full access to the house (at least until house-broken). I wanted a temporary solution that could hold-in a puppy, allow a cat to get over, and had a gate. I did not want to drill or put any permanent attachments into the walls.     This gate does the trick! Solidly built. Attractive white finish. Small puppy can't get though. Teenagers can't forget to close the gate as it is self-closing/locking. With a simple push of a button and a light lift the gate easily opens in either direction. The adjustment dials that secure the gate to the walls (2 on top, 2 on bottom) adjust to different lengths, especially handy design for walls with protruding baseboards. There are two additional gate sections that are included to increase the size of the span; I used the larger one and stored the smaller. Gate is secure and effective. The fit has to be tight to have the door secure to its jam (this is a design feature explained in the instructions).     My only small gripe, and one that is more with teenagers who sometimes step over the gate (and in the process bump it out of alignment) rather than going through the door, is that the gate has needed adjustment to properly align the door with the jam so that the locking mechanism self-secures. I have had the gate 3 weeks and adjusted it once so far (loosening the dials, adjusting the frame, and re-tightening the dials). Avoid the stepping-over issue and I think that the gate would be fine after the initial install. We (3 adults, 3 teenagers and a pre-teen) go through the gate dozens of times a day and it has worked fine. Took the cat a week or so to learn that he could jump onto and over it. We will save this gate after the puppy grows for grandkids (no rush). I looked at every other temporary gate and this is hands-down the best. I highly recommend this product.
B000JIHP88|5|I love this product. Very durable. I have come in many time to my baby hanging on this and it doesn't snap off as previous one have. It is multi directional and plays good music. What else can you ask for!
B00BLSXLU6|4|Our 6 1/2 month old weighs about 22 lbs, and is a little over 2 feet tall. Not fat by any means - she is about the size of a 12 month old. We ordered in size 12 months, and the height is great - but its very very slim cute. It would have been nice if the description mentioned that... very sweet pattern, and she is comfortable in it. I washed in cold, and dried on normal heat (we use 'medium' heat) and they did not shrink.
B0006FHFYS|5|We bought this when our son was 5 days old. He loved it more than his crib, he preferred to sleep in his swing until he was about 2 months. This swing was a life saver for us (first time parents and working from home) because our son did not mind spending hours and hours in the swing.  <br /> <br />Our son used it until he was 6 months and believe me I would have loved it if he could use it more because he was very attached to it but he is a big baby and weighed over 20 pounds at 6 months.... So we had to take him out of the swing for his safety.  <br /> <br />I very much recommend this swing, and hope your child will stay calm in it and let you do some work!
B006Y7P2MY|5|GREAT
B00HE66UO8|5|A very beautiful piece of baby furniture.  The crib is very well made, easy to assemble and is a gorgeous color.  Grey is a classy color that can be compatible with every color under the sun.  It's a refreshing change that takes first place against the traditional black, white and wood stain colors.  Make a statement with this crib!  So glad my daughter and her husband wanted something that was different!
B00BM3VTPY|5|Great soft, crinkle book. My daughter loves it!
B000MHX9P4|3|Good idea but peels off after a few months and leaves nasty sticky edge.
B003MZCSJG|4|Our favorite bibs are the baby bjorn bibs but they don't travel well; these are great - they still have a great still have a great trough but fold up great for diaper bag!  The only problem we've found is that the neck hole is a bit large.
B0036F7QU8|5|This is the only pacifier my baby will take.  If other people had problems with it - we have not experienced any.
B000058DQJ|5|I used every feeding. I don't have to wash my pad each feeding. I save my milk to my baby later too. Love it!
B002UD65R2|5|This fit my Chicco playard perfectly!  The colors are super cute with the \\"adventure\\" playard.  Super soft, washed well, and a great deal (compared to the prices at Babies R Us)!  It's alos a lot thicker than the other sheets I bought for my playard - almost a quilt-like thickness.
B00AO080QC|3|I purchased this for my best friend's wedding shower. I had intended it to be sort of a 'guestbook' for the people to write well wishes to her. I expected it to be completely finished and black all over like in the picture. Unfortunately the one I received basically didn't look finished. The edges were not painted. It almost looked like they painted a piece of wood black, then cut the G out of it and never bothered to finish painting the exposed wood edges. I wound up painting it because it really did look odd. Basically my disappointment with this purchase is that it doesn't look like the picture. The size and shape of the G was as described.
B006I20IYM|2|Cute lunch &#34;purse&#34; - good quality, nice colors, good fabric, and most importantly lead-free. BUT there is no closure on the top of the bag. One strap just pulls through the other as it's displayed in the picture. This wouldn't work for us since the lunch bag would be carried in a school backpack and tossed around - we were afraid food containers would fall out so we returned it for another Dabbawalla bag that has a zipper closure.
B00L7JL6ZG|5|Was exactly what I expected
B000WU9CYI|1|I bought this because of the good price. However, I had to return it (save the packaging until you try it out). It was completely unuseable. The static was so loud that it would have kept me up at night. I tried the two different settings and they both had way too much static.
B0042D69UQ|5|EXCELENTE
B003Y53YR4|3|If I had it to do over again I would not get this system.<br /><br />1 - The car seat buckle is kinda dumb. You have to hold it together before putting it in the buckle. If the kid is wiggling it is kinda hard to do.<br />2 - The front tire on the stroller gets loose and wobbles. It is a design flaw and Baby Trend knows it. To fix the wobble you have to tighten a nut and they put a sticker on there to remind you to not over tighten it.<br />3 - It has tires not wheels. I know it has to do with where I live but I have had to patch each tire at least once.<br /><br />My daughter does fit in it well. I can lay her back easily if she falls asleep and I can put a lot underneath the seat. I am a tall person and the handle is at a good height. The tray isn't too high for her to reach snacks off of either. My favorite feature is the parent tray with cup holders and covered compartment for phone/keys.
B0050GD2EU|5|I just recently used this bag and it did a great job.  The bag was sturdy and kept my daughter's stroller protected and clean.  The only suggestion I would have for Britax on improving the bag is to give the strap padding to make it more comfortable on the shoulder when carrying, or to even put backpack straps on it like the car seat bag.  Other than that, I loved the bag!
B00005BSM0|5|Our son is very comfortable in this tub, and it is very easy to use.
B005ET1D4O|3|These are cute and stick well to the onesie but honestly the colors are a lot more muted and there is a lot more squashy-orange color in them than what appears online.
B00012FGA6|5|These nets are very durable and helped in creating more space in my granddaughter's room as she continues to accumulate more pets. She loves her pet nets.
B009FU3Q5C|5|Very nice thermos ... perfect for soups for school lunch ... the kids said the soup is still actually too hot to eat right away when they open it up at lunch time ... I guess that's a testament to how well it keeps food hot!
B001CW7CVK|4|I read another review before I purchased the sea turtle version which said that if you try to turn on one set of stars or the other, you'll only end up with both at the same time. Turns out that was very true and quite a disappointment for my husband and I. However, the sea turtle was for our daughter and as it turns out, she did not care at all about it or even seem to notice. She still sleeps with it every night almost a year later! I only wish we had purchased the original brown twilight constellation night light instead. We'll definitely get her that one next time.
B00359XAGY|2|Out of the package of 12, only 1 duckie was truly yellow. The other duckies had a greenish/brown tint to them. Not at all attractive for the baby shower display I was hoping to create. I found these same little duckies at Michael's for the same price, so I'll just go buy them there. At least I can inspect the package to make sure I have 12 yellow duckies.
B0040BO77M|5|The quality of this production is beyond what I expected. I ordered several butterfly decals. This one is absolutely high quality and very beautiful! You can decorate many corns with it in your home. And it lights up your room immediately. I definitely will recommend it to many of my friends!
B00LLSUB8G|2|i really do not like this product. i as very excited then i got it as a gift with my second.  i found it frustrating to use as i could not see if my baby latched on correctly without uncovering the hole thing. kind of pointless. i gave it 2 stars for the pretty pattern and softness.
B00C2KW3FG|1|My newborn daughter loved this little chair. We used it instead of a bassinet the first couple of months. The incline and way it contoured to her made her feel very secure. Unfortunately she started developing a flat spot on one side of her head and we had to stop using it.
B00D3T3LYM|5|[[VIDEOID:3b87e502f11330cab7d0a60b0a1defed]]I think this had to be one of the more fun things I have bought recently.  I bought this to give as a gift to a friend for her baby shower.  I wanted to give it her ready to use so I had to be creative in getting some of her sonogram pictures without her knowing it.  I had a really good time trying out different sonogram pictures to see what they looked like.  The frame is 4x6 size and is like most plastic frames.  It's open at the top and sides and closed at the bottom.  You just pull it apart and put your sonogram picture in or you can pull out the mat and put in there and put both back in.<br /><br /> I tried it with different stages of pregnancy (early, middle, etc..).  I also tried it with some sonogram pictures that were closeups and some that were farther away.  I wanted to see if they all looked okay in it or if some looked \\"odd\\" but every one of them looked very cute.  I also tried it with some 3D pictures and again, very cute.<br /><br />I tried the magnet on the refrigerator and it stayed put.  It has a large magnet on the back and is so lightweight that I can't imagine it moving around much.<br /><br />As I played around with this frame, I got to thinking about what would you do with it when you really no longer wanted a sonogram picture on your refrigerator.  Here is what I did, I took the mat insert out of the frame and I laid it out as a scrap booking page and it turned out super cute.  If this were my frame, this is what I would do with it when I no longer wanted to have it out.<br /><br />I enjoyed playing around with this frame and can't wait to see what my friend thinks.  I included a video with all of my pictures so you could see how cute this frame really is.  This frame makes a great baby shower gift.  I am definitely happy with it.  I am so happy I was given this frame to evaluate and give my honest opinion.
B00005BTC5|5|Item arrived exactly as described. Been using daily for some time now and washing in the dishwasher - no breakdown in the rubber. highly recommend.
B00E3OYY1K|4|Great to put on a wet or morning dew ground. Made of plastic so would not use in the heat.
B001E8YG66|2|I am an avid Dr Sears fan, I bought the arm's reach original before my baby was born.  Little did I know that I never find use for it as a co-sleeper.  My baby refused to sleep on this for 3 months, think it is way too big for a new born and the mattress \\"pad\\" that comes with it must be really uncomfortable to sleep on.  We ended up sleeping side ways on our bed and had baby in bed with us.  While the arms reach laid empty for by our bed for 3 months.  Not safe and believe only baby slept.<br />Right before I went back to work I finally bought the Mamadoo playard topper and got him to sleep in it.  So he did use this for almost a year but mostly in the playard position.  In the end, I still have to buy him a crib.  So why pay so much money for this??<br />If I can do it all over again, I'd get something like the Fisher Price Rock N Play sleeper for new born stage, a good crib when baby is bigger and a pack n play for a portable sleeper.
B00EO37JBM|5|I bought these as summer blankets for daycare kids.  They are very soft, not overly babyish, and the kids were happy to get them.
B002GZ68UI|1|This blanket was very soft and continued to be soft after washing.  Unfortunately, after the first wash the blanket started pilling and looks and feels bad.  I have stopped using this blanket because i am afraid the baby will inhale the small fabric pills.  Not sure if this blanket is worth de-pilling since it will probably just pill again after washing. Very unhappy with this blanket  and would not purchase again.  I am very happy with similar style of blanket made by cocalo baby.
B001H9NXEI|3|The design sold me. It's so cute...but this is only a temp toy box. Lets see my husband and I bought the pink and brown girl version a year and half ago, roughly. The sides of the toy box don't have enough support to keep the box in a rectangle shape. It's bulging pretty bad. While it was fun as it lasted. I believe it is time to upgrade to a wooden or plastic toy box. I believe I bought this box for $30-$40..then I look at the prices of a cherry wooden toy box at a price of $55. If I had paid the extra $15-$25 I could have a toy box that would last many years maybe even a life time.
B00ETI64YK|5|I WISH this bag was available when I was pumping! I resorted to a stylish diaper bag because I didn't want to chance any spilled milk or cooler pack condensation from ruining my designer hand bags. It was around the same price as this bag and this is WAY cuter and more functional. So, I jumped at this chance to gift this to a very stylish working mama friend before the birth of the her second child. It is really the perfect gift for a baby shower or &#34;sprinkle&#34; or birthday/Christmas/Mother's day gift for a new or second time mom. Especially for a 2nd time mom who WISHES she had this the first time around, and because she probably doesn't need or want more toys/onesies/burp cloths. When my friend received it, she said she loved it, thought it was so stylish and such high-quality, she planned to start using immediately for a work/diaper bag, even before her 2nd baby as born and she started pumping again! The pockets hold everything you need to pump, or snacks etc post-pumping. Plenty of room inside for your personal items and the iPad/kindle pocket is such a nice touch for additional peace of mind that your stuff is not co-mingled and no chance of it getting wet, etc. Thanks Sarah for finally creating something we have all wanted, I will certainly be gifting this again to my mom friends!
B007CTPWXW|5|We actually bought this britax organizer for our baby jogger city mini gt stroller as it has better storage than baby jogger offered. It fits the city mini gt perfectly and we have been very happy with it
B000IDSLOG|5|I was blown away at the number of reviews Sophie has, and decided to give her a try. Yes, she's pricey for what's essentially a baby chew toy. Yes, she's made of rubber & squeaks, and could easily be mistaken for a dog toy. Yes, she lives up to the hype!  I got Sophie when my daughter was about 3 months old. I took her out of the package, washed her according to the directions, and handed her off to baby. Who, no joke, IMMEDIATELY grabbed on and shoved Sophie in her mouth! I think it was love at first sight. Now at over 6 months old Sophie is still baby's favorite toy. I don't know if it's her smell, her paint job, or if it's just magic, but if baby could talk I'm pretty sure she would tell me that Sophie is her best friend!!  I was so impressed I got one for a friend's baby, who had the same excited reaction and her own new best friend!  Many reviewers say that Sophie poses a choking hazard. I suppose baby might gag on the legs if they went too far in the mouth, but fortunately that's not happened to us. Many things a baby comes in contact with could be hazardous if the child is left unattended. I don't think this toy is any more hazardous than any other toy in baby's toy box.  Overall, Sophie is great for teething and has many fun spots to chew on. Easy to clean & small enough to throw in the diaper bag. I HIGHLY recommend this toy, it's totally worth the money!
B00SQXF1YI|3|I knew they ran small, but they are very small. .2-3t fits more like 12 month. My daughter is small and these are to little.  I made them into bloomers for under some of her dresses.  Really sad they were so small even after buying bigger size.
B004AHMCLY|5|These three balls, each about the size of baby's head, are exactly what we wanted. They are soft enough that you can toss and roll them without worrying about bonks. The bumpy plastic ball works well in the bath. The soft plush ball has crinkle areas that make a pleasant sound. The hard ball-in-ball rattle is pretty engaging for the kiddo as well. Would recommend without reservations.
B00AF73N1Q|5|Beautiful bright color, the minky is super soft, and it covers the seat perfectly! Love it!
B000CBNSJ2|5|This is the second light like this I ordered, the first being the same one but in black for my bedroom. This one was for my daughter's bedroom. We hung both swag style which was very easy to accomplish, but you will need your own hooks. Also although this chandelier is a bit small, it is beautiful and puts off more light than you would expect for the size. The only complaint I have is that when it arrived it was missing one of the large crystals and I can't for the life of me find who to contact to get a replacement crystal. I suppose I could have returned the whole thing, but I really needed the light and couldn't wait the time it would take to exchange the whole thing.
B00CWN8IK2|2|I liked this product at first because it started up right away and would let out a nice cool mist and humidify my room very well. After a few months of use, it began leaking through the night and would leave large puddles of water around the base. After another month, it began tweaking out and would pump out mist on super high, no matter what level I set the dial to, and would also make a loud buzzing sound. Now, it is dead altogether and I can't get it to work at all when I plug it in.<br /><br />It was great while it lasted, but it was more of a headache to clean and keep the area around it dry than was worth it ultimately. Unfortunately, it died just after the return window closed, so I guess I'm stuck with it now.
B00CWN3HQM|5|Loved this product!! Was great for our son (who had reflux)!! He slept in this until he was 6 months old. Great purchase!
B004BJ0TEI|5|Great products
B0042D69WO|4|This swing works.  It has AC power, which is really the only reason we bought it.  Batteries don't make sense in a swing like this.  It was a little overpriced, but we couldn't find anything cheaper that had A/C and good reviews.
B00AGJFNCA|5|This works as advertised. I get a good view of the child seat right behind the driver's seat and almost a full view of the seat behind the passenger seat. Installation was a breeze.<br />It does take a day or so to get used to, especially if you are used to using the stock rear view mirror and the side mirrors, before merging turning etc. The picture may seem a bit blurry at first, but it really is not. Once the eyes get adjusted to it (it took me a day or two), you stop noticing the difference in field of view between the Pikibu and the side mirrors.
B001NPD74W|3|[[ASIN:B001NPD72Y Britax Frontier Booster Car Seat Rushmore]]  This carseat is very comfortable for my 3 1/2 yr old.  We've always used britax and I do prefer the old model that they've discontinued now to this one.  This model is VERY wide and goes over the seat in a couple of places.  I drive a volvo xc90 and for us this carseat makes using the middle seat with a booster impossible.  The other thing to know about this seat is that it is very difficult to get really tight.  You can use the latch and the seat feels okay - but not nearly as tight as the other britax carseats we've used.  Overall still a good purchase, but there may be better and less expensive options out there - wouldn't buy it twice.
B00GNOG8OY|5|Love the tommee tippee bottles (that is, baby loves them).  Easy to clean because the opening is so wide.  I REALLY like that the nipple has a valve in it, which helps baby drink comfortably.
B00BFEUM3A|5|So much easier to clean than the mesh feeders!
B00L9NR672|5|This is the perfect diffuser! Great for my kids room! Diffuses for a long time and ever disperses the aroma.
B00TVF00DM|5|Super cute and like that I could customize color.
B002UXQM16|5|These bottles have been lifesavers for both of my sons.  Easy to clean, maintain and sterilize we've had very good luck with Mam products.
B0002VAF3Y|5|I had to replace my last rail because my son had picked the netting apart and left a big hole. This one was easy to assemble and works well without the strap. Would buy again.
B005670P0W|3|fell off immediately; needed additional adhesive to stick to the refrigerator door
B0007A2JFC|5|Awesome shopping cart/highchair cover!  User friendly - only need one hand to set in the cart or highchair all while you hold your baby. (And my little bundle is heavy and wiggly!)  Worth paying extra for instead of the floppy bag or the other less expensive ones.  Has turned shopping trips and going out to eat into enjoyable experiences.  Especially for a germ-phobic parent.  Covers completely, has great storage, good padding with a pillow and a nice toile print that can be for a boy or a girl.  Don't know how I lived without it.  Highly recommend!
B001LENCUE|5|Great bottles, just have to remember to put them together correctly or you'll have a leaky mess.  My son still spits up though, I don't think it's because of the bottles.
B005FTKUNI|5|I love how soft these sheets are!  They fit my Graco Pack & Play just fine, though they are a little big.  I just tuck the little extra under the mattress, and it works.  I was using the Graco sheets for the Pack & Play when we traveled, but once we got rid of the cosleeper and moved to the Pack & Play for full time sleeping, I wanted something softer for my baby.  These sheets do the trick, and they match the colors on our model fairly well.
B00005QI1G|5|This bouncer is amazing!!  I don't know what we would do without it.  Our daughter has loved this bouncer since she was 5 weeks old.  It gives us HOURS of free time everyday.  She loves the activity bar and when she is tired of it you simply remove it.  She will also take naps in the chair and loves the soothing vibration.  We bring it with us where ever we go.  That way we can actually eat dinner with a group of friends and she enjoys it too.  It is light weight and easy to bring into any room you are in.  It is also very easy to wash and dries quickly.  I highly recommend this bouncer!
B00009P7I5|1|We received this monitor as a gift.  Our son is only 4 months old and the night light in the first one stopped working.  Safety First did replace it at no charge to us but the second unit is all static.
B00C17WFJY|3|It does not stay put
B00J5WVD1E|5|Came in early and is so soft and beautiful! Worth every penny!
B0097JZ0IC|4|We still cant decide if they actually close before the force makes them snap shut, meaning they could still touch the floor, but I guess for more briefly than if it didnt snap shut. We still like them as gifts because they are intriguing.
B000YDDF6O|4|it has been my baby's favorite since he was one month old and now he is six month old and  he still likes it especially when he sits in the car seat. however he can not enjoy it if there is no one to help him to press the music bottom. it will be much better if there is auto mode.
B0038K1EOA|5|I love this and so does my newborn daughter! I live in Chicago and the winters can be harsh and seeing that my daughter was born in November I knew she would definitely need to be kept warm when we traveled from home. I don't like bulky snowsuits and the Jolly Jumper is the perfect alternative. It protects the baby from all of the harsh elements while giving you easy access to the baby. This is the perfect way to keep your baby warm without all the fuss of putting on a bunch of layered clothing.
B002GP775S|1|This cart is so cute it is a shame that it is so poorly made!  The wheels fall.  The rubber parts of the wheels also constantly fall off.  I returned it.
B00IK1TYTE|5|It's hard to buy a book online that you can't peak inside of but I really love the look of this book and all the pages. I love the woodland theme on all the pages, where the pictures go, but when you add the pictures it would cover up the little animals! still, love it.
B0033B9CZ2|5|just what i needed for a used medela pump in stlye breast pump.  The tubes fit perfectly and I bought new accessories elsewhere and its like having a new pump!
B0043D28CI|4|I am hoping my granddaughter will like it and I won't know until Christmas but I'm sure she'll love it.
B00VVSYJJI|4|Nature's Bond double breast pump is a decent pump for the price. It is definitely not hospital grade but does the job. It has two settings. The first helps with let down and the second does the stronger suction. It didn't feel as strong of a suction as other pumps that I've tried and I also couldn't pump as much milk, which is the reason for 4 stars. But again good pump for the price.
B006P3BCDA|5|I love that I can move it from one bathroom to another, put it on and take it off the faucet.
B005DD57UM|4|I love this stroller. It was amazing when my son was still in his infant car seat, and how much extra space for storage it has. In addition it allows a babe to lay flat when in the stroller, which worked wonders for us when we were at the fair etc. before my son was able to really sit up on his own, we laid him down and he just drifted off to sleep and was as comfortable as he could be! The Beware warning I want to give, is that I have searched for a snap on tray for this stroller, since my son is now a year old, but can't find one. Additionally this stroller is wider than a typical stroller so it's a tight fit through doorways. Just be aware of that before you buy it, otherwise I have no complaints!
B0013FCQIA|5|I have been using the Dekor products for years -with first son (now 5 1/2) and now with second son (23 mths). Best diaper pail/bags around
B008G4LKJ2|3|Material way thinner than I expected
B002MXSAD2|5|My baby isn't born yet so I haven't used this for baby food yet, but I HAVE used it for freezing homemade chicken stock. I just filled the 2 ounce cups, popped it into the freezer and then stuck the frozen segments into a ziplock and then repeated. It makes the perfect-sized little portions and is extremely easy to use. I love how flexible the silicone is and am looking forward to finding other uses for this. I would highly recommend this to anyone, not just those wanting to use it for baby food.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, it is not airtight so it could get freezer burn. But I have never had this issue and you can avoid it as well by simply transferring the portions to a freezer bag once it's frozen. If you are looking for a container to hold what you make in the freezer indefinitely, this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I like this so much, in fact, I would have purchased a second or even third one for convenience if it weren't for the price. Once my baby is old enough, I have a feeling I will be investing in another though.
B00LB0AT18|5|High quality & soft. Worth the money!
B003FGWA8G|5|I never used a monitor with my two kids, but I finally gave in and bought this one based on the good reviews.  It is a life saver. It is plugged in on the third floor of our house and I often go down to the basement or even outside and have never had a problem to clearly hear the swing swinging or my son starting to move around or &#34;complain.&#34;  I like the low battery alert, the &#34;mute&#34; function and the design in general.  It is well worth the money.
B000RH5DTY|5|They work
B00DQED5YA|5|I  have two very active, squirmy 19 month old twin boys.  I was tired of working up a sweat at every diaper change, so out of desperation I ordered the PooPoose.  I was initially afraid this changing pad wouldn't be very effective at keeping the boys still enough for messy diaper changes, but was pleasantly surprised with the very first diaper change.  My bigger/stronger twin has tried to pull open the Velcro many times, but hasn't been able to even open it a tiny bit.  After a minute of squirming, the boys seem to actually chill out once they realize they aren't going anywhere or twisting off the changing pad.  After about a week of having the PooPoose, I decided it was definitely worth the money to order a second one for the changing area I have set up on the first floor of my house.  I have recommended this product to MANY people. Well worth the money.
B000MAER3Y|4|I bought this thinking I'd get more use out if it being that it goes up to 30lbs however my baby is needing a stage 2 car seat because of the height limit. It's easy to wash if needed, the patterns are neutral, it fits nicely in the snap n go but the fabric is pretty hot and not very breathable.
B001CDFPY0|5|A must have for the changing pad. Will save you from having to change the changing pad cover so often.
B0010PW3A4|5|This is by far the best gift I received at my baby shower. I had to wait to use it till my baby was weighing enough (12 lbs) and could fit in the ergo without any issue. Then my life became so much easy! Anytime I was going out, all I had to do was carry my ergo with me. Whenever the baby got fussy, needed to be nursed, or was just sleepy, it didn't matter if we were at the beach, in a restaurant or out with friends, I would carry the baby in the ergo and within minutes she was happy and often went to sleep without a fuss.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone with a baby...I did not even need to purchase a stroller till my baby was 9 months old! The ergo is all I needed and was less cumbersome in crowded places. Great product!
B0036CUEM8|4|This is a great product. I bought the lion and the monkey for my 1 month old twin girls and it was the first paci they actually would keep for longer. They can hold it in place and even train taking it to their mouths. It stays in place in bed when they're swaddled or in the car seat so it helps them fall asleep. And they look adorable with them!
B006CQU95W|5|Awesome product!
B00208RTX6|3|I ordered this product to protect my daughter as she was chewing and actually taking chunks out of her crib.  While this product does what I need it to and prevents my 10 month old from eating her crib it could use a few improvements.  There are three ties to secure it to the crib there should definitely be at least 2 more.  The outer material is a very soft fleece, which is great, but the inside is a slippery almost plastic sounding material.  Combine the wrap not being as secure as it could be on the crib rail and a slippery inner material and you get a product that does not stay in place very well.  It does not come off and I don't think my daughter could get it off as you would have to actually untie the ties, but when she pulls herself up on the crib rail to stand the wrap slips and moves around causing her to fall down.  I feel bad for her as she has a very difficult time holding on to the rail while standing now.  All in all the product does the job I need it to, so in that regard I am pleased with it, and would rather have my baby not able to stand as easily opposed to eating wood and paint off her crib.  I do wish there was more effort by the manufacturer to produce a product that stays put on the crib as it would only have taken a few more ties or less slippery material used underneath.
B00BH0QLVO|1|TERRIBLE quality. This thing is the biggest POS ever. Do not waste your money. Flimsy, horrid sheet, and faulty design.
B00BPIKJF2|3|Looks great, but I don't see any sizing information posted for this product.  This should be included in the specifications
B004GIGSLW|5|the necklace is great. i love it. hope my sister in law does to. its a gift for her and her twins...
B00EFQXOTO|5|I love this high chair. It is sturdy but light weight, easy to clean, and holds our little guy just right. Removal tray cover is great too!
B00S3HGG9Q|5|UPDATE: 1 star to 5 stars!  The company contacted me after seeing my review and sent me a replacement on the day I replied.  I have been using the new one without any problems.  Great customer service! ----------------------------------------- I loved it as it is very light and small in your diaper bag. However, the snap came off and it won't strap together after using mine only a week.  Material is well but poorly made.
B001WAJVZM|5|It took some maneuvering but it fits very well over the tub spout. I wouldn't want to take it off very often. It's very cute. I believe it will provide great protection if someone should slip and fall - hopefully I will never find out!
B000J1OOJI|4|It is well made and baby likes it - she will play even if she's seen it before - first time we gave her she grabbed it at once!
B000056IYV|1|I bought these sheets in pink, washed it on gentle in dreft, put the dryer on air, no heat, and it shrunk. I have the extenders but the sheet shrunk to much for it to be safe in the crib. I never got to even use it, and cannot return it because it was washed ( ridiculous since the package even states wash before use). Oh well. I went to Target and bought a knit sheet for less that has never shrunk, and its been washed every week. I advise you buying their brand.
B000JVXUPM|5|very good for my baby!it's easy and helpful.but can not clean easily.last i think it was a little expensive but helpful.
B008OJ7C6Y|4|the piece of mind that you get from this product is worth the price you pay for it. my daughter stopped breathing in her sleep one night when she was 2.5 months old. we took her to the ER and they kept her for testing but basically said it could have been reflux or just an ALTE and sent us on our way. while we were still in the hospital i ordered this and it was waiting for us when we got home two days later from our stay. the only annoying thing about it is that i had a few false alarms but i would rather have false alarms and no that it is working than not hear anything at all. you have to make sure it is firmly placed against their abdomen so when she was littler i had to fold the front of her diaper to get a tighter fit. the beeping is pretty quiet but my daughter slept in our room with us so i don't know how hard it would be to hear over an audio baby monitor. she wore it until she was about 9 months then the battery died. i tried to replace them ( i went to a battery store and had them put in a replacement battery) it but it never turned back on again...by that time we werent using it as much so I decided it was okay to finally stop using it but had I not been ready to give it up I could see its randomly stopping working to be a big problem.
B000HCQX5W|5|I bought this for a beach trip in October and I couldn't be happier.  It kept my daughter warm and in the water or on the beach for longer periods than she would have been able to tolerate without the long sleeves and full shirt covering.  Very happy.
B000HLVDY4|5|This stroller has been great.  It takes a bit of work to put it together, but not an extraordinary amount.  And although our daughter hated it at first, a few graham crackers while sitting in the stroller cured her \\"fear of the new.\\"  If I must come up with a complaint, it would be that the stroller is bulky when folded up, but I can't imagine how they could make one less bulky that has the same features.  If we need the space, we use an umbrella stroller.  But if we want comfort for both parents and child, we use this stroller.  We'd highly recommend it.
B000RZGYCG|5|I had been using a combination of Soothies and Avent wide mouthed bottles and switched to Born Free because of the BPA scare.  They work great and my 10 month old loves them.  I feel I am providing my baby with a safer product.
