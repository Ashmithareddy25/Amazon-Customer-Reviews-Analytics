B00005BJ2O|5.0|I don't buy many soundtracks to films anymore, (last one was for The Thomas Crown Affair) but I loved the music so much in Moulin Rouge that I ended up purchasing this one. I particularly was impressed with the voice of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. They were good! Love the ballad &quot;Come What May.&quot; An enjoyable cd overall.
0517122707|5.0|The world of Ignatius Reily is very erratic but it is easy to identify with him. You are going to hate him at too many places in the story, yet there is something genuine about him. He does the most awful kind of things, but you never know whether he is doing that intentionally, full mindedly, absent mindedly or it just a part of his highly intellectual mideval, semi-selfish almost unemployed negligent  personality.<br />Apart  from Ignatius Reily, there are more characters in the novel that  are very genuine. I believe that genuinity of the  personages  gives a lot of vitality to the story.<br />It is amazing to see that this book was written almost 30 years ago, but it is still very modern and the situation of Ignatius is absolutely not unusual to see at the beginning of the 21st century.<br />If you like to read a book in order to think read A Confederacy Of Dunces. If you do like to read a book NOT to think you can also read this because readability and having fun with the story are warranted.
0783246641|5.0|With its extra five minutes, the film gets a completely different meaning. From a simple vision of the yuppy who is psychotic and kills to get his kicks in the financial world and goes through with it because he is a yuppy, it becomes the description of his psychosis and we do not know at the end if he has really killed or only imagined the killings. We are a lot more led into thinking that it is all a bad dream, a nightmare, a psychotic hallucination. It thus becomes the third panel of a tryptic. The American Dream first, which has to do with the dream of people arriving in the US and succeeding in making fortunes, or at least enough money to become the middle or upper middle class : the opera of American success and capitalism in its positive understanding. The American Nightmare then, which shows how those who do not succeed in making that first trip into wealth, fame and power, are led into killing, crime, at times sordid crime. These are the losers and they can only survive in this wolfish society as wolves and criminals. Capitalism leads to crime, either petty crime for the poor losers or organized crime for the more ambitious. The American psychosis is the third element, with crime developing in the mind of a successful subject in order to fuel his success. It is the story of the Golden Boys, of the Yuppies who have to be so ruthless with others in order to dominate and have the upper hand in the financial field that they develop, inside themselves, a completely murderous psychology. The only missing element is the urban paranoia that Stephen King explores in, his books, i.e. the fear of standard average Americans that their neighbors be enemies of the system, hence of them, and try to take over the system and make them slaves to their outlandish, extraterrestrial, revolutionary, dictatorial, funtamentalistic, dogmatic or sectarian objectives aiming at seizing power and then retaining it.<br />This American Psycho is absolutely essential to understand modern America. It is very well connected with the period (the 80s) and President Ronald Reagan, with his speech on the Irangate were he explains that this crime of money, warfare, power and politics is a good thing after all because it reassesses and reasserts the power of America within and without the US. Crime leads to power, and power requires crime, even if it does not justify it, and even if it does not have to be justified, except with the positive result of making America stronger in the world.<br />A great film for advanced viewers who are able to go beyond the surface of things.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUAmerica.

0553812173|4.0|Laseen, Empress of Malazan, has just crushed Pale, one of the last two Free Cities yet to fall under Malazan domination.   However, the fight for Pale was unutterably ugly even for the seasoned fighters in the Malazan army.  But Empress Laseen isn't quite finished yet.  She is determined to grind Darujhistan, the last of the Free Cities, under her heel.  However, many forces both inside and outside the Malazan empire are conspiring to see that doesn't happen.  Tattersail, a powerful mage in the employ of the Empress has just witnessed the death of many of her companions during the siege of Pale. As they make the move toward Darujhistan, Tattersail wonders if the death of so many powerful mages was indeed the work of the enemy or rather of someone closer to home.  Whiskeyjack, the seasoned veteran of the elite Bridgeburners squad also has doubts about why so many of his people were left to die in the siege.  Ganoes Paran, a newly promoted captain knows he is simply a pawn, but whose?  And finally the gods themselves have decided to take a hand in things.  How will their presence affect matters?<br />I can't even begin to do justice to the plot of this story in one simple paragraph.  But I really hate to give too much a way because it is too fun to discover all the different people in this book.  I discovered Erickson while casting around for someone to read after reading the latest installment of George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series.  This was recommended to me.  Little did I know that I couldn't get it in the US.  Thank heavens for amazon.co.uk!  Got it in a week... <br />I can not sing the praises of this book more.  I only gave it 4 stars because I did have a hard time getting into in the beginning.  It does begin a bit slow and there is so much information that I had a hard time absorbing it all.  But about the middle it starts to roll along and then it really picks up steam until it ends with a bang!  Great momentum and a true page turner.  And for those of you who like a big meaty book, this is it.  <br />However, the slow beginning is really worth it.  The one thing I love about this book is the main thing I love about the GRRM books, the panoply of characters.  Some are good, some are bad but many, many, more are somewhere in between.  And although there is a huge cast, Erikson somehow manages to create a wonderful depth to them all.  They each have a definite personality including quirks, foibles and vulnerabilities.  Even the unsympathetic characters are given real moments of humanity. <br />I can not recommend this enough,  If you like large, sprawling books with a lot of characters who are all plotting and counterplotting, this is it for you.  I especially recommend it for those who enjoy the Robert Jordan or GRRM series because it is along that vein that this book is written.  However, I do stress that this book is not a cookie cutter of those two.  It is as different form The Wheel of Time and The Song of Ice and Fire as they are from each other. It has its own flavor and Erikson has created a very different idea of magic in his book.  I am eagerly awaiting the second book in the series to arrive (it should be on my doorstep any day now).
B00004WEJZ|2.0|It took me a while, not being a rabid Bond fan, to realize that this was a re-make of Thunderball. Ok, Sean Connery starred in the excellent film, Thunderball. So, some director pulls him out of mothballs to make another &quot;bond&quot; film. Ok, WHY REMAKE A FILM SEAN ALREADY STARRED IN? It makes no sense at all. They didn't even change the plot or the character's names. When hollywood rips off shakespeare plots like &quot;hamlet&quot; at least they change names and add/remove stuff. If Sean was to make one last bond film, why couldn't they pick a film he never made, like a Roger Moore bond flick, or a new plot entirely? This movie is senseless and stupid. The only redeeming points are seeing Kimmie basinger in her hot outfits, and seeing her underwater in scuba gear. Also, there is a scene where she is to be sold off as a white slave, that's interesting to contemplate, as the arab creepy guys count out their coins to purchase her! Forget this movie, and go get Thunderball.
B00005214X|5.0|What happens if a very very good songwriter is in the same band the 2 best songwriters ever are? Well, you dont need to use your imagination because that is exactly what happened to George Harrison while he was with The Beatles. Both Lennon and McCartney were such a great songwriters and had such huge egos that limited poor George to a maximum 2 songs per album. Harrison never said a word, he just kept on writing stuff. So after the Fab 4 broke up he had LOTS of great songs writen and not yet recorded. His work exploded into this magnificent 2 cd (3 vinyls then) set. He was free at last to express himself as a solo artist, giving fans and critics something they never see coming from him: a great record. This is a must have for any beatles or Harrison fan out there, specially now with the remastered version.
B000005YZM|5.0|I know I will face opposition from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; fans on this point, but I have argued for a long time that the 2 most important pop lps of the 60's are the Beach Boys' &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; and its most obvious cousin, the Zombies' &quot;Odessey and Oracle.&quot;<br />There are many reasons for my stance on this, but the most important reason is the album itself. Unlike &quot;Pepper,&quot; which even Lennon put down in his later years as being uneven, &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; is a beautifully constructed lp of majestic beauty that is years ahead of its time. It's somewhat unfair to call it a &quot;psychedelic&quot; lp for the same reasons that Love's &quot;Forever Changes&quot; isn't quite psychedelic. Both lps transcend categorization. For every &quot;Hung Up On a Dream&quot; (arguably Rod Argent's finest 3 minutes- I call it Rod's &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;- listen to the 2 tracks back to back..both 3 minutes...amazing similarities) there is a glorious &quot;Beechwood Park&quot; or &quot;I Want Her She Wants Me.&quot;<br />Chris White (his songs the true beneficiary of the late 60's technological progession and more overtly influenced by psychedelia than Argent) and Rod Argent proved time and again on this lp that they were master songwriters and musicians of great majesty, with White's progression as a songwriter startling. As was true for the band throughout their brief tenure, they were willing to take great chances on their tracks. Their obvious understanding and tasteful, proper use of the mellotron, is the pre-cursor of the 70's Progressive sounds; the use of backwards tape loops makes White's harrowing &quot;Butcher's Tale&quot; all the spookier. And those harmonies! Colin, Rod, and Chris created among the finest 3 part harmonies ever made. Accentuated, as always, by the pure competency of Colin Blunstone's empassioned vocals, Paul Atkinson's (very underused, alas) guitar, and Hugh Grundy's always rock-steady drumming, White and Argent could flourish, and did. <br />Alas, the Zombies sank like a stone amidst all of the psychedelia around them, leaving &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; a brilliant swansong. One can only venture to guess the brilliance that could have emerged from the 5 members had they stayed together, but it was not to be. The Zombies lived all too short of a life, while vastly inferior bands lived on by adapting their styles to the flavors of the day. The Zombies stayed true to their music, and &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; clearly shows this. This is a main reason why I rate &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; as high as I do.<br />This release offers both stereo and mono versions of the album. Listen to both versions. The mono versions offer brilliant insight to the band's strengths as musicians and vocalists, while the stereo offers the brilliant production as well as the effects that make this lp as special as it is. An absolute must have gem of the highest order.

B00003CWL5|1.0|I saw this movie for three reasons. 1, it's a &quot;Comedy/drama,&quot; and being an aspiring actor, I wanted to learn something. 2, it looked interesting, 3, my friend badly wanted to see it, so we went to the theatre. From beginning to end I wanted to leave, but kept thinking &quot;well, I'm sure some good will come out of this movie&quot; (none did). Yes-the acting and directing was supurb and phenominal, but the content was filthy! This screams American trash, garbage, and filth all rolled into one! Before I go on I'd like to say happy for those who liked this film and they are entitled to their opinions. And if you have seen this, or going to see this because your favorite actor, director or producer was apart of it, hey, the more power to you. Located in the rich suberbs, Kevin spacey stars as Lester, the husband and father of a disfunctional family, whom from the beginning is masturbating in the shower because his wife is to controoling to be with him. Annette Benning's character is a shallow, phony, snob who ends up cheating on her husband with somebody she works with. Their teenage rebellious daughter sleeps with the neighbor boy who was following them around with a video-camera from the beginning, and she hangs around a filthy-mouthed friend whom the dad tries to sleep with. Then again it was my fault: I didn't know much about the movie, and it was rated &quot;R&quot; so I should have known better. If you want to see it, borrow it from somebody you know, check it out at the library, or rent it. But don't buy it. If you see it and don't like it, remeber-I warned you.
B00005KFUM|4.0|The best way that I can describe them is 65% Radiohead, 30% Queen, and 5% Metallica!<br />A crazy mix indeed, and very enjoyable at that!
B000002JS6|3.0|How can anyone say this is the best album ever?  It's not heavy, it's not melodic, and all the songs sound the same!  Okay, it is energetic, and many of the songs on here, such as &quot;Hells Bells&quot; and &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; are heralded as classics, but this is nowhere near the best album ever.  This album came out in the same year as Iron Maiden's debut and Ozzy's &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;, and those two albums blow this one right out of the water.  And, must I remind everyone of a little album called &quot;British Steel&quot;, by a little band called Judas Priest?  That album also came out in this year, and it too is far superior to &quot;Back in Black&quot;.  AC/DC is not a bad band, not at all, but they are far too repetitive and not nearly talented enough to deserve the godlike status they are given.
0807261785|2.0|I bought the first eight books because I [thought I] was getting a good deal.<br />The first two volumes I've read cause me not to harbor in my breast very much in the way of salutary feelings for this universe that the pen name Snicket has erected.  I get a flavor, a whiff of a watered down mix, say of The Addams Family, plus the style of narration found in the late Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide To the Galaxy series.  But it is not a well blended mix.<br />If you're going to play at the satirical, you had better be slicker and stronger than what went before your work -- both elements of which are missing in this unfortunate series.<br />One thing is clear though: the author has not found his voice -- the characters are too wooden and the anachronistic blend of Victorian with Modern is not that artfully done.<br />In terms of the humor department, I find little humor in these books.  The humor there is is not sufficiently dry and ironic to really provide top notch entertainment, which is something I feel strongly these too high priced books lack.  The plots are not that ingenious.  Hell, there is just not enough sly wit in any of the first two books for me to say I really like the humor!  There is only one humorous line in any of the books, which is the author's monologue with his imaginary audience concerning his disclaimer that the book(s) are pleasant.  It is nice to know this, once.<br />Unfortunately, this too is spoiled rotten becasue we soon find the author nattering on about this fact repeatedly throughout the book -- apparently he is so enamoured (enameled is more like it!) with this particularly humorous bent that he feels it is vital to inject it (and us as well) with said disclaimer in at least three parts of each book!  Hey, I think kids will  &quot;get it&quot;  the first time they read it, no repeats, please!  We first notice the humorous disclaimer on the back cover, but then we also suddenly find it in the first chapter, then later on in the umpteenth chapter....  Ridiculous! <br />Overall I rate  &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;  a mediocre tale, filled with dull, ungraceful humor, and an absurd plot.
6305165912|5.0|After I first saw this movie in the theater, I didn't know what to think about it. All I knew was that I wanted to see it again.<br />After many more viewings, I'm still not sure what to think about it. But I still want to watch it again.<br />The more I watch it, the more I like the acting. And the story line. And the vivid imagery. And even the bowling (this must be THE ultimate bowling movie).<br />The DVD version is a big advantage; much of the appeal of the movie is visual, and the wide-screen format is necessary to preserve it. There is also a nice, long interview with the Cohen brothers that gives some interesting background on the film (including explaining some of how they got the great bowling shots).
B00000IAU3|5.0|This a beautiful debut cd from Dido Armstrong, who has appeared on tracks of her brother's trip-hop band, Faithless. I recieved No Angel last Christmas and love it a lot. The album opens with Here With Me, which still gives me chills whenever i hear it. (this song also happens to be the main theme for the show Roswell) Hunter is the latest single that is one of those empowering-girl-i-don't-need-a-man songs. my lover's gone is one of the most beautiful heart breaking songs i have ever heard and i'm surprised it hasn't been used on a movie soundtrack yet. i love the song thank you, even though it is overplayed. isabel is a very sarah maclaclanish song that i like. so all in all, this is avery girl cd that makes you want to say, i'm happy with who i am. peace ;)
B00000G3AZ|3.0|This is a small story, in that nothing really &quot;happens&quot; in it. It's a character study, set in a small circle of upper-class denizens of a village in Elizabethan England. The most dramatic moment is when Paltrow's character lets an insult slip out of her mouth - an act most unbecoming a lady.<br />From a technical point of view, this movie is nicely crafted. The acting is top-notch, and the story is tight. The look and feel of the period shows an attention to detail that is fun to watch.<br />The only problem is that it was unable to make me care much about any of the characters, or what happened to them. Even when the characters were watching their lives crumbling, I still felt like a member of the audience, watching the actors moving around on the screen. Nothing that happened was able to draw me into the movie.
B000002GQE|4.0|This album is supposed to show the day in the life of an average working Joe. There are songs like &quot;Lunch Break&quot;. The London Festival Symphony orchestra coordinates rather well with the Moody Blues. This is one of the earliest attempts to put out music that would latter be termed &quot;Progressive&quot;/ &quot;Art-Rock&quot; or Sympho Rock. From the point of view of reviewing this from a Progressive standpoint, the work is so-so and seems contrived by our prospective.<br />Famous songs are of course, &quot;Tuesday Afternooon&quot; and &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;. The second half of Tuesday Afternoon is quite Progressive, but unfortunately it is always deleted from radio stations.<br />5 Stars from a historical prespective 3 stars for a modern Progressive prespective
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I can't wait to get my own copy of this movie.<br />The first thing I'm going to do is to go back and try to watch the parts that I missed because I was laughing too hard the first time. I couldn't even breathe for much of this movie.<br />The second thing will be to go through again and get a better look at the many subtle - almost throw-away - jokes in both the dialog and the animation.<br />I will say that this movie is not appropriate for all kids. It gets a little gross, containing some bathroom humor and some gore (at least, talk of gore). Parents of sensitive kids may want to preview it.

080017948X|4.0|The premise of this movie is pretty basic. An arrogant TV reporter is trapped, reliving one day over and over. He's the only one who knows it; everyone else starts each day as if it's the first time.<br />What makes it so fun is the way that this idea is developed. The movie is clever in exploiting the possibilities of the scenario. It's funny, and also warm in that we enjoy watching the development of the character through his experiences.<br />The DVD version is well-done, but doesn't add much in the way of bonus material.
0060931671|5.0|Conspiracy buffs, look no further than &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; -- a book that indulges in paranoia so much, you almost expect to see your own name mentioned somewhere in the text.  There is an incredible amount of narrative inventiveness on every page, employing a wild concoction of dry humor, non sequiturs, bizarre characters with puns for names, and an endless barrage of references to a wide variety of pop culture, science, and technology.  This is the first novel I've read that has introduced the concept of entropy as a narrative device.  <br />The protagonist is a woman named Oedipa Maas who, when the novel begins, learns that her former boyfriend, the wealthy Pierce Inverarity, has died and designated her to be the executor of his enormous estate.  Inverarity's assets include vast stretches of property, a significant stamp collection, and many shares in an aerospace corporation called Yoyodyne.  As Oedipa goes through her late boyfriend's will, aided by a lawyer named Metzger who works for Inverarity's law firm, she learns about a series of secret societies and strange groups of people involved in a sort of renegade postal system called Tristero.  She starts seeing ubiquitous cryptic diagrams of a simple horn, a symbol with a seemingly infinite number of meanings.  Every clue she uncovers about Tristero and the horn leads haphazardly to another, like a brainstorm, or a free association of ideas.  <br />This is a novel that demands analysis but defies explanation.  My initial interpretation was that it's an anarchistic satire of the military-industrial-government complex, but it's deeper than that.  Like Vladimir Nabokov's &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; it establishes a very complicated relationship between the author and the reader, where Pynchon seems to be tricking the reader in the same way that Oedipa is unsure if she is witnessing a worldwide conspiracy or if she is merely the victim of an elaborate prank.  By presenting Oedipa's investigation to be either circular, aimless, or inconsequential, the novel seems to satirize the efforts of people who try to find order in the universe.  Pynchon uses the concept of entropy to illustrate that the more effort (physical and mental) we put into controlling the universe, the more random it becomes.
B00003CXA2|5.0|In this movie, the life of a slow-witted Forrest Gump intersects most of the important events of the previous 40 years, even to the point of influencing the course of history.<br />But this is not what the movie is about. It's mainly a story about how having a solid character and a pure heart can carry someone farther than having intelligence. In fact, Forrest gains a certain advantage from his lack of intellect, in that he's more free to react from his heart.<br />Another notable aspect of the movie is the use of visual effects that seem to show Forrest interacting with famous historical figures. Pretty realistic.
B00000JGEI|3.0|While it is true that T2 boasts some excellent special effects and elaborate action scenes, it's just not as well-made as the original. For one, it's frequently way too dramatic and serious.  It's practically humorless, while T1 was chock-full of dark humor.  Why Cameron didn't add the same wit into this sequel baffles me.  The drama and talk between the good characters is prententious and overlong. Secondly, the pacing is not as good.  T2 is too long, and by the time we get to the great climax, we no longer care what happens to the characters.  We just want more action.  While T2 is long and has ups and downs, T1 is thrilling throughout. Third, the characters are extremely unlikable.  Sarah is portrayed as a tough woman who has no problem holding a child at gunpoint and beating up anyone who gets in her way.  John, for the first half hour or so, is just plain annoying. Finally, the film is just bland and uninspired.  There are plenty of shoot-outs and explosions, but it's very tiresome and hardly exciting.  T1, however, was full of suspense.   So, while definitely not a bad film (it's entertaining at least), it does prove that bigger doesn't mean better.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This movie is said to be loosely based on Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;. I guess &quot;loosely&quot; is a key word here; you won't find much Homeric imagery in this movie.<br />But one thing that does seem to be adapted from Homer is the style of the story, which is not so much a single plot as a succession of adventures loosely strung together. Here the Cohen brothers did a good job of constructing a series of adventures that are worth the telling, and are up to their usual standards of presentation.<br />I found the prominent use of bluegrass music throughout the movie a little hit-and-miss. It helped set the tone of the movie, but was somewhat distracting.

B00003CXRP|4.0|It's hard to say enough for Tom Hank's acting. Not to mention the extreme physical changes he put himself through for the part.<br />The storyline was also strong through the early and middle parts of the movie. Some truly great moments of drama and human insight.<br />But the ending gave me the impression that they didn't really know how to wrap up the movie. It's a bad sign when the main character has to finish the movie with a monolog that sums up what he's learned; a better movie would have made you understand without having to spell it out in words.
B000059XYL|5.0|Hey I don't know how is your night life over there but what I saw in this movie is something I would be very willing to experience.

And you out there are all invited when we open up our bar.

B00005KARK|5.0|I hope that people are not put off by the age of this film.<br />True, it doesn't have the jaw-dropping animation of recent films. And it doesn't have the excitement and peril of many other Disney films (Rescuers, etc.)<br />But it is a touching story that's well-told. And the animation makes up for its lack of technology through sheer artistry. Throw in the great songs, and you get a movie that just doesn't grow old.

With convoluted interlocking plotlines, sketchy charecterization, obscure math jokes, patronizing footnotes, and the most inexplicable sex scene I have ever run across, this doorstop of a novel was not the pleasure I had hoped for.  A groundbreaking work in the field of literature intended exclusively for hard-core coders.

B00003CY5K|4.0|I almost didn't go see this movie.  It looked like it might be another &quot;Clueless&quot; or &quot;Heathers&quot; etc.  You know the &quot;Barbie genre&quot;.  But the in-theater previews I had seen made me believe there was more to this movie than that.  It turned out I was really glad I did see it.  It was funny and very sharp. Yes, at times it was almost too cutesy and/or dumb, but the key word here is almost.  The director never seemed to let things get too out of hand.  One of the reasons why I enjoyed this movie so much is I genuinely liked the character, Elle,played by Reese Witherspoon. She was funny and caring and shockingly smart!  And her dog!  I haven't enjoyed the appearance of a dog throughout a movie that much, since seeing &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;.  The courtroom scenes were terrific and, at times, hilarious.  I especially enjoyed it when a person stood up in the back row of the courtroom and snapped out a succinct opinion of the pool boy witness who was currently testifying! Those of you who've seen the movie will, I'm sure, remember the scene.  Even now, several days after I've seen the movie, I still laugh out loud when I recall that outburst.  In fact, I find myself smiling whenever I think of the movie.  Now thats a &quot;good thing&quot;.

B00003CXA2|5.0|In my opinion, the best movie of all time. Well, my lifetime at least. I laughed, I cried. I sometimes wonder how Forrest is doing now. I remember coming out of the theater thinking, &quot;Wow!&quot; This is a must buy. I have the VHS, now I will have the DVD
6305280711|5.0|Usually I am not too entertained by movies like this, as they all have the same plot.  But this one does it with style.  Not only is there heart pounding action through the entire movie, but there are many funny scenes added throughout.  Although parts of the movie are quite cheesy, that's to be expected from a movie of this genre.  Hats off to the actors; Bruce Willis does a good job and Samuel L. Jackson is incredible.
B000002LHX|5.0|Ok, so you can't compare this to something along the lines of Prince masterpieces such as &quot;Sign 'O The Times&quot; or &quot;1999&quot;, but we have a winner here nevertheless. Too often a soundtrack will simply be a random collection of hit songs from established artists with only so many of the lyrics connecting to the character's emotions or feelings throughout the film (ex: The last 2 Batman films' tracks), but Prince, in his own quirky way, manages to steer away from that trap and then some, with such stand-outs as &quot;Electric Chair&quot; (&quot;sung&quot; by the Joker) and &quot;Scandalous&quot; (&quot;sung&quot; by Batman, at the Batcave scene when he opens his cape to Vicki?). Almost all of the songs here flow seamlessly throughout different parts where the characters could be thinking that. Plus, you can't go wrong with &quot;Partyman&quot; and the convulted-but-nasty and unusally funny 200 Balloons remix into &quot;Batdance&quot;. Strongly recommended along with the oh-so-awesome Danny Elfman's score.
0440180295|5.0|What a remarkable look at such a terrible thing.  The story of Dresden, Germany isn't often heard of.  I hadn't heard of it until I read this book.  Then again, neither is the true face of war.  What it does to people--to children, not men.  This book is great because it doesn't glorify it like so many modern movies and books do.  It shows the lasting implications it can have.  It doesn't pretend the people involved were &quot;men and not babies,&quot; nor are the characters Frank Sinatra or John Wayne.  It tells it like it is, and it's a hard slap in the face.
0060277246|5.0|I cannot even comment on the masterful works of C.S. Lewis...suffice it to say I'm hunting down the best bound editions of his Narnia series. I find this Special Edition (ISBN: 0060277246) to be of excellent quality. Great binding, nice paper, beautiful illustrations, and an very nice silk bookmark. Now if I could only find the rest of the series bound/printed/produced as well as this one!
B000002J1Y|5.0|Can you see the footprint on the jacket? Roger Dean's cat walked on the jacket. So, Roger had to made it darker. If Bruford played more than 2 songs(even though it is 20min.), I would give 6 stars. This album is really special to me. The tracks like Six wives, mood for a day and roundabout were the first impact of Prog. rock on me.  I saw their concert recently (7.31.2001). They did very good job but still I miss Bill's drumming. Sorry, Alan but... but after all, this is one of the best live recording in any aspects. Easily 5 stars.

B00003OSSM|2.0|I thought something, some kind of big secret, a &quot;shock&quot; would be discovered, of course more than the affair, or &quot;the affair&quot; is just for cover something...until &quot;the end&quot;, so I felt lost and empty after seeing this movie. One is a cop, another is a congressman, their wife and husband died together in this horrible way, and they are always so serious...and this film is so serious and cold...it is a thrill style, isn't it? I understand &quot;the affair&quot; is a serious object to the two alive people, but by this way??? It is not a bad movie, but I couldn't feel satisfied after the director did his job like this. He's given us some wrong implication. I think we should add something into this movie, let the alive people find out some truth we normal people really call &quot;truth&quot;, then the movie will be perfect. 2.5 stars actually.
0316776963|1.0|I was disappointed and embarassed. I had given this book as a Christmas present last year to a member of my family because I read so many glowing reviews about it being funny and that the author is a modern-day Mark Twain. But I hadn't yet read it. Yesterday I saw it in the airport bookstore and bought my own copy, anticipating a fun read for the next seven hours. It wasn't fun and it isn't funny. It's like eating chewing gum off the sidewalk -- something novel, but not something you want to have inside your body.  I'm embarassed that I gave it as a gift and I am writing an apology letter; they must think I regard them as boorish, gross, and unfunnily sarcastic people. Don't waste your time.
6302989787|5.0|This movie was Clint Eastwood at his very best. Eastwood plays the role of a Secret Service agent who is in charge of protecting the President. He had previously been on the detail of protecting Kennedy in Dallas. John Malkovich is absolutely evil and sinister in his role as the assasin. He and Eastwood struggle throught the entire film. Eastwood's girlfriend also adds to the movie. This movie is tense from the beginning to the end.There are plenty of action sequences that keep the movie very<br />lively and entertaining. The ending effectively wraps up the movie. Buy and watch this video. You will not be dissapointed.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I cannot really add much to what has already been written about this CD.  It suffices to say that Radiohead remains the most brilliant, experimental, and unique band on the face of the earth.  All Radiohead fans will want this disc in their collection.  <br />Don't be dismayed by those who say Radiohead are getting &quot;more obscure&quot; with each album.  Buy the CD, plug in your headphones (the best way to listen to any Radiohead CD), and let the music take you away.
6300213803|5.0|I've seen 8 of the 9 Star Trek movies (never happened to catch #5 for some reason), and for my money, &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot;, the second in the series, still rules supreme. Here, the Enterprise is a training vessel for new cadets with Mr. Spock as their captain/teacher. Captain now Admiral Kirk is merely along for the ride when news reaches them that a new threat is underway, and the fledging crew is the only Starfleet ship in the vicinity. Plenty of drama as the innocents and the Old Pros take on danger.<br />&quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; succeeded where &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; had failed to capture the hearts of Trek fans, and ensured the dynasty of films to follow.          <br />There's a few things I like about this film: 1. Ricardo Montalban as Khan. RM reprises his TV series episode role as Khan, an evil genius, the leader of superhuman, superstrength musclemen. He used to be smug, but since our last encounter, he has become embittered and extremely hell-bent on vengeance against Kirk personally. Of course, he's willing to destroy humanity if that stands in his way too.<br />2. The subplot about getting older. This theme got touched on again in &quot;ST: Insurrection&quot;, but it is far better treated here. That's because there is no remedy for it, except ultimate resignation to the fact, as we see here. So, Kirk in &quot;WofK&quot; must come to terms with mortality in a very special way. By the way, the movie outdoes the show here, because there is no such thing as &quot;dead but brought back to life&quot; which always removed dramatic tension in the series. Here, reality is reality. &quot;WofK&quot; would not be out of place as a tool in bereavement groups, because we see that like in the epic of Gilgamesh, even heroes cannot control life and death. When I saw as a college student this the day it premiered in NYC , I actually cried at the end! Wouldn't do that for many movies, and none of the ST movies to follow.<br />&quot;Star Trek: TheWrath of Khan&quot; deserves all five stars.
B000050HTO|3.0|Q: Is it possible to capture essential Bob Dylan on ONLY two discs?<br />A: No.<br /><br />Any Bob Dylan compilation absent \\"Desolation Row\\" is seriously flawed.
B000002UAC|3.0|Meet the Beatles is the album that has the super hits I Want to Hold Your Hand and This Boy, the tunes that define the early Beatles!  Not to mention that there are no Chuck Berry samples on Meet the Beatles, only pure fab four.  Now, I have the original Meet The Beatles on vinyl, and that is easily a four and a half album!  Now, I realize that Meet The Beatles was distributed by Capitol, not The Apple, so thus it has never been released on CD.  However, if you want a true snapshot of the Beatles at this point in time, and see why they initially became the world renowned super band that they were, keep an eye open for the classic &quot;Meet The Beatles.&quot;
B00005JKES|5.0|I watch this t.v. show yearly, and always find something new hidden away.  Even if the show began to loose it's edge in the second season (let's face it, it did) to be able to see the whole thing in it's entirety on the clarity of DVD, with sharp sound, picture which would blow away what's on the market now...cheap, EP tapes. And the potential for extras is huge, commentary tracks by the stars of the show, directors of the show, and of course, Creators Lynch and Frost. This needs to happen.  And I will rush out and get in line, the moment it becomes available.
630438551X|4.0|The widespread criticism of this film is a bit puzzling to me, as any film that makes the timelessness of Shakespeare not only palpable, but beloved by the MTV generation as a cult video hit should be appreciated and, hell, lauded for such a feat. <br />And this play, above all others, to my mind, *needs* to be kept alive for teens to enjoy, as it's a breathtaking story of the purest love driven to tragedy by foolishness and impatience. It's the perfect catharsis for the broken-hearted, and the perfect date movie.<br />Shakespeare was first and foremost, an entertainer for the masses, not an obtuse artist whose work was only meant to be appreciated by a select few. (I know there are plenty who'll argue that point vehemently with me --- bring it on.)<br />DiCaprio gives us a great slacker in Romeo, who shows (to borrow from another play) &quot;only the suits and trappings of woe&quot; when we first see him writing love poetry to an unrequited love at the beginning of the film, and he flares to life wonderfully after meeting Juliet. Danes does a great job playing Juliet as a young woman, who is mature but so deeply in love that she ignores her better judgment, rather than going the easier &quot;ditzy girl&quot; route with the character. Nearly every actor in the film does a top-notch job at contemporizing their characters. <br />As for the film itself, much has been made of the colourful art direction and the music-video editing, but it is really only truly radical on the surface. When compared to another recent contemporisation of Shakespeare, Michael Almerayda's Hamlet, Luhrmann's take on Romeo and Juliet truly is quite conservative in preserving the play's meanings beneath the flashy surface. <br />My only qualms with the film? At times, the soundtrack truly hurts the film, adding nearly nothing and actually hurting the mood. Poppy songs like The Cardigans' &quot;Lovefool&quot; are shoe-horned in just for a moment or two, for the sake of saying they were in the movie. On the other hand, Des'ree's gorgeous song &quot;Kissing You&quot; is perfect for the title lovers' first meeting, and Radiohead's two additions, &quot;Talk Show Host&quot; and &quot;Exit Music (for a Film)&quot; work wonders for the mood. <br />The opening scene of violence, obviously paying homage to Hong Kong action cinema is done with far too much over-the-top campiness. The opening scene should to be so memorable  that the intense violence echoes throughout the rest of the play, adding proof that the lovers' families are truly the most bitter of enemies. As it is, not only is the scene quite easily forgotten, but the tone is completely out-of-sync with the rest of the film. Luhrmann shows us that he can quite capably handle scenes of memorable violence later in the film during Mercutio's death scene, though. <br />The constant bombardment of Christian imagery grows a bit weary and obvious at times (even showing up in the film's &quot;R+J&quot; title) but Luhrmann's message that the purity of love is sacred and even holy is well-intentioned and rings true.<br />Thanks to great performances and energetic direction, though, these flaws don't come close to spoiling a fresh and exhilariting update on one of the greatest works of drama in history, one which will be beloved of me and my peers for years to come. <br />And the chicks dig it.
B00005J6UP|5.0|There is a brand new video commentary, which is a first of it's kind.  It is making it's debut on this DVD where the cast's commentary was filmed (in anamorphic widescreen no less) and the movie can play as a thumbnail while watching the actors and director watch the movie...fantastic!<br />Also, thanks to a Goonie Fan campaign, both parts of Cyndi Lauper's music video (also directed by Richard Donner) HAVE been found and BOTH will be included on this release.  Goonie fans can now REJOICE!
B00000612Q|5.0|It's not his last great album (that was Smiler).  It's his greatest. Rod can be the best rock singer of them all with his ability to be the &quot;guy in the song&quot; (like Sinatra did with pop).  That changed with his sex symbol identity in the 70's (sorry, Rod).  Give a listen to these songs.  He was at the top of his form singing from his soul and not his image.  &quot;Mama, you've been on my mind&quot; is the pinacle of his sensitivity (his greatest gift) and with the more fun songs like &quot;Twistin' the night away&quot; he made the song a party (his other gift).  This collection of performances showed the best that Rod could be and that's pretty darn good.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is the movie I watch when I'm having a bad day.  It starts off rather melancholy and sad, but ends happily.  The rediscovered love between Anne and Captain Wentworth never fails to cheer me up.
B00004R7TP|5.0|If you thought the LP or the original CD sounds good, This totally remastered version is incredible, Plus the addition of 6 bonus tracks makes it cool for the collector. Under the ivy is one of Kates best songs ever..only available before on This Womans Work(box set) No doubt this is Kates finest hour and she shines bright on every track....Rock on Kate!!!!!
B000001U3K|4.0|This is the closet Lou Reed got to the mainstream. With the help of David Bowie, Lou Reed made &quot;Transformer,&quot; a seventies pop classic. It isn't as great as &quot;Berlin&quot; and &quot;Rock 'N' Roll Animal&quot; but it doesn't even come close to one of Lou Reed's many crimes against humanity(&quot;New York,&quot; &quot;The Bells,&quot; etc.) &quot;Transformer&quot; is simply good pop with the Velvet Underground underground New York scene lyrics. Lots of people will remember such hits as &quot;Perfect Day, &quot;Walk On The Wild Side,&quot; and &quot;Satellite Of Love&quot; which indeed are the best offerings on this album. The rest are good but not as well perfected. &quot;Transformer&quot; is great but not Lou Reed's best, it's just his most popular for obvious reasons. Check out &quot;Berlin&quot; if you want to see the REAL Lou Reed.
B00004Z459|5.0|Ok Linkin Park is not only a kick ... band but all of hem are hot. They know how to rock out all the time. All of the songs on Hybrid Theory are good. Crawling, paperclip, and many more. It has good beats and great lyrics to go with it. It's good jamin music or just chillin music. I gave this CD 5 star because i was a backstreet boys fan and know I am a linkin Park girl all the way! Plz you have got to get this CD it is off the hook!
B00005K3OT|1.0|A cheery, pretty, liberated, headstrong atheist comes to enlighten a town of stodgy, joyless, hypocritical, mean-spirited, loveless &quot;Catholics.&quot; (I use quotes to denote the stereotyped Hollywood cartoon-type depictions of what liberals imagine religious types to be.) She opens a chocolate shop, which tempts the hapless villagers during Lent. Although the film is about tolerance, she seems completely oblivious or uncaring as to her causing the townspeople to stumble in their religious observances, openly inviting them to sample her wares during the holy season. Although she is rebuked for this, it is done through the unlikeable religious villain, so she's actually given a free pass on this. Figures of spousal, parental, and spiritual authority are ridiculed. Traditional marriage is likewise shown to be defunct. In the cookie-cutter mould of films like these, &quot;religious&quot; types resort to hatred, violence, etc. in God's name. There is a little balance, however. At the end, the young priest gives a message on tolerance. This might be good (tolerance = loving the person while rejecting their error) or bad (new tolerance = accepting and applauding error), depending how it is interpreted. Also, the &quot;bad guy&quot; is finally humanized, and the townspeople suddenly realize that Christ calls them to love! Wow, what a revelation. They have been living in ignorance of their own religion for decades. Thank God for liberal atheists. Although there are pretensions to deeper waters (&quot;The Sly North Wind&quot; - perhaps it's better used or explained in the book, but it's utterly an useless device here), it's predictable, without much depth; like watching a long, alternate-world episode of &quot;The West Wing.&quot; Thus it will be lauded and loved by all but the most thoughtful liberals (the ones who didn't scream for &quot;Fight Club&quot; to be burned). Don't say you weren't warned.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|All the promise of &quot;Tidal&quot; is well and truly delivered on with Fiona Apple's second album. The thing that really strikes me about this album is how convincing the 'sound-world' is - it suits her vocal and songwriting style perfectly, and is a credit to both Apple and producer Jon Brion. And the quality of the songwriting is pretty high - the lyrics of &quot;Limp&quot;, &quot;Love Ridden&quot;, &quot;Paper Bag&quot; and &quot;A Mistake&quot; are some of the best you'll find anywhere. The only complaint (and it's a very minor one) is that the musical structure of a few songs seems a little unbalanced: &quot;On The Bound&quot; takes too long to finish, and a couple of others reach the bridge or repeat choruses before I'm ready for them! So it's not perfect, but it's pretty close. More than anything else it makes me excited to hear what she'll come up with next.
B00005MAM2|5.0|that movie it's amazing, the sound and the film are incredible, it's the second time that i saw this movie, and the quality is very high.  In the second disc you have a full image gallery, and some clips, i have one word, for this dvd. cool.
B000050XEI|1.0|I admit to not being a huge Enya fan, but some of her albums, particularly &quot;Watermark&quot; and &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, are quite enjoyable. This one is, with only one or two exceptions, incredibly bland. Add to that the fact that it's short on playing time, and I can only conclude that it's not worth getting unless you're determined to have a complete Enya collection. Or you want some extremely inoffensive background music.

078881172X|3.0|my brother liked this film about these kids that tell stories about peter pan and then he finally comes and takes them to his world where he wants them to stay, and if they dont they can never come back. The land is for kids only and they wil never grow up there. There are mermaids, and pirates, etc and new charecters and kids and exciteing for the whole family.~
B000002H33|5.0|This CD is my favorite CD, ever. It's absolutely amazing. Buy it. Trust me, you'll love it.<br />1. Battery: Beautiful acoustic intro, it sounds so greatly crafted. Then, it gets loud...and then, fast. The lyrics are great, very intense. 2. Master of Puppets: My favorite song. Has good parts for everyone. The lyrics are amazingly creative and perfect...exciting song. 3. The Thing That Should Not Be: TTTSNB is a great song because it starts out knida quiet and creepy...then goes all out and it's awesome. The lyrics/vocals and perfect. Based on H.P. Lovecraft (poet)'s work.  4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium): Softer at first, then goes straight into &quot;SAN-I-TARIUM...leave me be!&quot; and on...great song...a nice work of art. 5. Disposable Heroes: I like the vocals best in this. But the downpicking's so great it's scary. Anyways, it's catchy...the lyrics are great for putting in signatures, profiles, etc. 6. Leper Messiah: One of my favorite songs. Often underrated...great guitar work, it's catchy...and the lyrics are great. The vocals are amazing...I just love them on this song. Great job by James, and too bad this song isn't talked about more often. 7. Orion: AWESOME INSTRUMENTAL. Stunning for an instru. 8. Damage Inc.: Fast and aggressive. Awesome.<br />BUY THIS CD, it's worth it!

6300214044|5.0|I first heard about the Elephant Man in the sixth grade, when one day, after getting home from school, my mother pointed out to me a book written about him.  I found it, at first, quite bizarre,  and when I saw the photos of Joseph Merrick himself, the disturbing visions stayed in my mind, quite vividly.   Getting home, though I had thought of the book to be, back then, as one I might not be interseted in reading, I found myself reading a description of its contents inside the front cover.  This, I discovered, was highly intriguing to me.   Reading chapter by chapter each day, I reached the third when I finally decided to finish reading the book...so I completed the rest in one day.  It was so engrossing that I could not put it down and walk away from it.  And the story stayed fresh in my mind long after that day.   I recently had the priveledge of seeing the movie made for it, (just last night (8-9)) and neither could I walk away from the so vividly portrayed story of Joseph ('John') Merrick.  Since I had read a book about him, I was able to predict what would happen along the way, such as when he built the fantastic model of the cathedral, and then when he so tragically died.  I still do not understand why I did not burst out in tears at certain parts of the movie, but all the way through it, I had a lump in my  throat, and my eyes were constantly wet.     I grew to love this man more and more as I watched the movie.  John Hurt so wonderfully depicted 'John' Merrick that it was somewhat difficult to tell the difference between the actual person and the emotionally gripping actor.     This movie is one of the best that I have ever seen, and is probably one of the greatest films ever created.  And now that I have seen the movie, Joseph Merrick's story will forever stay in my mind.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I LOVED this movie! Not only was it a huge, fun, campy extravaganza the entire way through, with excellent music to boot, there were things in it that I normally love in theatre or musical productions which most movies seem to lack. For example, the oddity of the cinematogrophy--the dreaminess of some parts, the obvious lip-synching, and other things you may pick up on--are because the entire thing is through the memory of the narrator. Sometimes in a movie you see only what the main character sees; in this one, the bias and fuzziness of memory are added. In a stage when most of what we get from Hollywood seems to ride on action/violence and sexuality and little else (not that this one doesn't have some of both, especially the latter), Moulin Rouge stands out.
6300214044|5.0|I first heard about the Elephant Man in the sixth grade, when, coming home from school one day, my mother introduced to me one of the many books written amout him.  Telling me a bit about him, she then turned to the photos in the center of the book, and those disturbing, then, images have vividly lived in my mind ever since.<br />  Thinking of the book as one I might not be interested in reading, I found myself turning to the inside of the front cover, engaged in learning about this strange human being and his even stranger condition.  (Which was thought to be neurofibromatosis, (NF) but was actually a similar, but different, condition known as Proteus Syndrome.)  I finally got to the point were I wanted to read the whole story, so I finished the book, (from the third chapter,) in a day.  <br />  I found the story so intriguing and engrossing that I could not put it down and walk away.  My mother had also told me about the movie made for him, and that famous and powerful line: 'I am not an animal!'  These words shall never be forgotton.<br />  Two days ago, (August 9) I finally got to see the movie, which we rented from the library.  This moving film was equally engrossing and astounding, and never did I move away from the T.V. as I watched it.  <br />  Joseph ('John') Merrick's story was so intricately captured in this film in which, because I had read that book, I was able to predict what a few of the upcoming events were, such as when Merrick constructed the cardboard cathedral, and when he watched the play which he so wonderfully enjoyed.  A few of the events in the film, however, were alien to me.  These had not been in the book I read, as it included some fictional happenings and was more inaccurate than some of the other books written about Merrick.<br />  John Hurt portrays 'John' Merrick so greatly that the two people, the actual Merrick and the movie Merrick, were near to exactly the same.  The way Hurt's character was treated is so much more disturbing than his appearance that it might count as the only thing disturbing about the film.  Compared to this, Merrick was not ugly at all.<br />  I still do not understand why I did not burst out into tears at certain parts of the movie, but I so thouroughly enjoyed it that, I suppose, there was no reason to do so.  This inspirational film is one that no one will, or should, ever forget.  And it is, in my opinion, one of the greatest ever created.
0790729628|4.0|It is very unfortunate that they deleted the film noire dialogue. It was very important to the story and was important to give a philosophic view to the story. The unicorn scene seemed unimportant to me, apparently it hinted that Decker was a replicant, but i do not get how. And I am lucky I still have the original so i can watch it, because in my opinion it is far better, and the simple implementation of the unicorn scene did little for me, since i do not understand how it proves his true identity as a replicant. This is still a great movie. But i also suggest you get the original and watch it first.
0671024256|4.0|More than just a great read,  &quot;On Writing&quot; is a conversation from one writer to a budding writer highlighting the glory and the realism of what it takes to get your work recogized and published.  Stephen King is a wonderful mentor--pushing you to persevere and to take the discipline seriously.  He gives examples and &quot;life lessons&quot; to motivate, inspire, and move you.  No blood, guts, or ghouls in this book--but it IS filled with the &quot;spirit&quot; of the author and his passion for the written word.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie was a hoot and is probably the second best movie I have seen this year (the best was undoughtedly A.I. Artificial Intelligence). It would be interesting to see if it gets a nomination for best picture, but the best movies almost always come out Sept.-Feb. just before the oscars. Being a digital movie I imagine the transfer will be clear and basically perfect. It should look very good. If you don't know what I mean check out one of the Toy Story movies on DVD.
0380796090|5.0|I read Marion Keyes's &quot;Lucy Sullivan is getting married&quot; first. It was wonderful, so I couldn't wait to read &quot;Watermelon&quot; which is actually her first novel. I &quot;Loved It!!&quot; Keyes's main characters are hysterical! They think and sometimes say what we'd love to at times. You will really enjoy this book. The main character Claire, really find her strengths in this story. At the end you almost feel like applauding her! ....A &quot;Must Read!&quot; You'll love it....
0553106635|5.0|Like some other fantasy epic's (Jordon/Goodkind ??), I expected this series to start fast and become predictable by book three.  This is not the case.  This book is full of surprises.  I especially enjoy how he manipulates your point of view by introducing one of the bad guys as a narrater in this book.  After hating this character in books 1&amp;2, I found myself cheering for him in book 3.  This book was a wild ride and I never expected things to end as they did.  I am anxiously awaiting book 4.

B0000549B0|5.0|If you are someone who likes Jimmy Stewart- you'll love this film.  In my opinion, this is his best performance. I love the part where Stewart's character says, &quot;My mother told me that in this world you have to be really smart or very pleasant. I used to be smart, now I prefer pleasant.&quot; When Jimmy Stewart died he left a big void, luckily much of his work is on video and DVD for future generations to enjoy and learn from. I sure admired him and thought he was both really smart and very pleasant.  Get this movie and share it with everyone you know- it's a gift.
B00005MM83|5.0|After recently purchasing and watching this film i immediately rewound the video and pushed the play button of my video remote again. You can't look away from the screen at all. Although some people may find it hard to keep up with the film as the sceenes of the film are played in reverse, but once you have pieced this together the film fits together into an exiting and unforgettable thriller. The film contains so much information the endless twists and turns and ever unravelling storyline is too much information to take in all at once, so you need to watch the whole thing again. Amazing....Unique....Not another film like it.....Definetely worth seeing.
B00004X01U|2.0|The songs that are heard on the radio are great, but the rest are really in poor taste. They are short and not well written. It was like she went through a rhyming dictionary just to make her songs rhyme. Buy the singles, but don't waste your money on this one, it definitely doesn't come close to her past albums.
0887306128|5.0|First of all, if you're looking for a highly detailed review of the content of this book, nope, wrong place! I review books with the enjoymnet factor being of number 1 importance. What I learn after my enjoymnet comes next. There's another review of this title that you can read for high level stimulation. So, let's get going...<br />I liked this book a lot, how's that for intellectual. It reads well, I was entertained and I learned a lot more then I expected, which is good for I planned on learning a lot about becoming an effective executive. But history lessons, hey, this is a bonus.<br />Mr. Drucker uses, as have other leadership teachers, many important history lessons of this century to illustrate his effective executive points. He includes life adventures of Gen. Marshall, Presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy, even Bach, Mozart, Verdi and Haydn to illustrate points.  One of my favorite comments is from Chapter 5 (First Things First), &quot;Executives can hardly assume that they are 'executive Mozarts'&quot;. No more hints, you'll understand when you read the book. The chapter addressing &quot;The Elements of Decision Making&quot; is the best of the book, although the others are not far behind.<br />If you are in the market for a book on executive leadership, you better put this close to the top of your short reading list. If you are searching for an insightful look at some 20th Century history, then this is a good stop for the political scientist.  Whatever your reason, buy and read this book, and see how it helps you become a more decisive and better leader, oops, &quot;Executive&quot;.
B000001EGE|5.0|This was the first without Buckmaster's orchestra. and I must say it improved greatly. I think this is the way Elton was meant to be. I just bought this CD a couple days ago and I love it. While his next album, &quot;Don't Shoot Me..&quot; was just way too popish, this goes away from the 'pop' rules and still managed to scrounge up a couple of hits, &quot;Rocket Man' and &quot;Honky Cat&quot;. But the other songs is what i bought it for. &quot;Hercules&quot; is the BEST track on here. and I love the folk-rock songs on here like &quot;Slave&quot; and &quot;Monalisa's &amp; Madhatters&quot;. And as an encore, a reprize of &quot;Slave&quot; being played in the style of &quot;Hercules&quot; (minus the rhino whisle). was the iceing on the cake. To me this album is golden!
1570425671|4.0|This book was a really fantastic collection of 6 short stories regarding the holiday season.  I had heard so much about David Sedaris and what a talented satirical writer he was, and I was much impressed by his ability to parody the American publics love/hate relationship during the holiday season.  His life as an elf in the Macys's shopping store in New York had me laughing out loud.  And the upbeat Christmas letter that includes the introduction of a Vietamese stepchild was hilarious.<br />I finished the book in two days of light reading and realized the author is truly dark and twisted but extremely talented.  \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is next on my list.  I guarantee you'll like this book, but just to add to the fervor of the writing, I suggest you read it a week before Christmas during your most hellish and frantic points of your life; it'll add to the hilarity of your situation.
B00005A1VG|5.0|This is the oldest video I've ever seen, except the version I saw didn't looked like it was black and white.  When I saw the movie I was amazed at the sword fighting, it looked as if they didn't even care about they're moves.  This is indeed as old as the dinosaurs, I indeed think this filled with action and adventure.

B00004U2HK|5.0|This one of the oldest shows I've ever seen, and the most musical. When I first saw the movie, when I was about three of four, I of course, fell asleep. When I next saw the movie, when I was still four, I actually stood awake and watched the movie.  When the show was finally finished, I could hardly even get face off the TV, even though it was done. Then everyday I put on the video, and enjoyed it on until I was six, and I still like it now.

B00003W8NM|2.0|First let me say that the opening few minutes of this movie blew me away - the opening credit sequence alone is almost reason enough to rent this movie.  And David Fincher definitely creates some of the most striking visual images you'll see on film. (But, as he proved in Alien 3, visual style alone doesn't make a good movie).  I especially liked when Norton was walking through the Ikea catalog that was his apartment.  Norton, Bonham-Carter, and especially Pitt give powerful perfomances.<br />However, I found that this film amounted to less than the sum of its parts.  Get past all the violence, and the anti-consumer philosophy, and this movie is basically a satirical comedy about a depressed guy who's losing it.  And it's not very funny or entertaining.  None of the &quot;philosophical&quot; stuff in this movie is anything new, nor is it especially profound.  The idea of a programmed, white-collar drone who walks half-asleep through life has been addressed hundreds of times before, all the way back to &quot;Metropolis&quot; (or hell, even &quot;Joe vs. the Volcano&quot;).<br />     The messages are clear and not really very thought-provoking:  consumerism, advertising, and big business bad.  The comforts of modern society prevent us from feeling truly alive.  We become owned by the things we own.  Man has been turned into a self-help parody of himself by all the so-called &quot;men's movements&quot; that only aim to make man a more feminine version of himself.  Is any of this stuff really that deep or thought-provoking?  Have any of us not thought about this stuff until &quot;The Fight Club&quot;?<br />     The bottom line is that this movie is trying to be more than it is - had it focused on being simply a dark comedy, maybe it would have worked.  Instead, it tries so hard to be hip and subversive that it simply doesn't end up being very entertaining. Maybe this movie will appeal to angry young people who are fed up with &quot;the system&quot;.  But for most others, it will be a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

B00000IRED|5.0|&quot;The Truman Show&quot; should take the award for the most original film of the 1990's.  Copycats usually come in twos or threes after a good original work such as this.  It's obvious why others could be jealous, because they didn't think of it first.  But this movie is not just about Truman, it's about everyone's life individually.<br />If you really want to get the most out of this movie, eat it with ice cream, as eating something pleasant with a movie reinforces your memory of it.  If you watch carefully the subtle interactions between all of the characters, and what Truman did in his spare time, you'll begin to see that he &quot;was in on it&quot; sooner than first realized.  What was Truman doing in the yard when Merryl came home with the Chef's pal (when he was digging in the garden)?  Did Truman really believe that Sirius 9 was only a fallen stage light?  These are the subtle clues that allowed him to prepare for his break (from &quot;reality&quot;) while the producers in the Lunar Room complacency at their pizzas.  &quot;All unusal activity has to be reported,&quot; said Christof, and that single blunder allow the storyline to unfold as if each one of us was under the scrutiny of an entire television staff, complete with the God-like voice booming from the clouds that announces...I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it.  Only a fool would not respect Carey's talent here, more than just a comedian trying to establish a character actor niche.  &quot;The Truman Show&quot; is something that allows each of us to grow and realize more is happening in our lives than can be seen.  Watch it again today!
B00005IC2H|5.0|Stanley Kubrick has passed on to another world, been given the resources to create more films, discovers a deeper understanding of the redeeming virtues of the human condition and the beauty that can be life itself. He makes a movie about it. Sigur Ros provide the soundtrack.
B000021XS0|5.0|MASTERPIECE !  Thats the only word I can use to describe this album. Im an old time ELP fan. Just recently I began to search for bands who have what ELP had: variety, individual skills by the artists, change of pace in the tracks and a story to tell. Apart from Dream Theater, Spocks Beard and Glass Hammer come a long way (will stay an ELP die-hard all the way). <br />But this album has all !! Its one fluent story of the outmost quality !! I have all the Dream Theater CDs now, but this one is absolutely the best and it deserves each and every star.<br />If you like a CD to be listened to as one thrilling story being told, buy this CD. Its worth each and every penny !
B00003CXRM|5.0|&quot;O Brudda&quot; is like, sheer freekin GENIUS. MEN: watch George Clooney comb his hair and LEARN. &quot;Dapper Dan Pomade&quot; has to be the greatest invented product in a movie since &quot;Red Apple Cigarettes&quot; from &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Bad hair day? All you need is Dapper Dan and a hairnet. Boo-yaahhh!<br />The gopher-on-a-stick was pretty funny, as well. John Turturro's stint as a toad was also GENIUS ...I liked Clooney repeating the mantra &quot;We're in a tight spot!&quot; when a posse finds our heroes holed up in a barn. The movie looks great. Sounds great. Is great. Clooney's the pater familias, and the Devil has a red, bifurcated tail. You will LAUGH when Don't-Call-Him-Babyface Nelson kills cows, and you will LAUGH harder when the cows get their revenge!  The KKK-Dance Scene is just weird enough to merit a musical of its own:  perhaps the Coens should take it to the Great White Way in NYC and use it as an opener to Mel Brooks'  &quot;The Producers&quot;!  Zoom zoom zoom!<br />P.S.  I keep using the word  &quot;GENIUS&quot;  as a service to my fellow Amazon customers, who seem to think the word is spelled  &quot;genious&quot;.
6303965415|4.0|I really liked this film and couldn't help watching it over and over again. Hinds' depiction of Captain Wentworth had so much eviction and passion - he was extraordinary and Amanda Root - however not my favourite for the part, enacted it remarkably well. The chemistry between the two were amazing. This was aided greatly by Roger Michell's camera angles and lighting effects - he generously captured all the correct emotions that Austen expressed in her novel with such subtlety &amp; perfection. I also particularly enjoyed the character portrayals of Lady Russell, Mrs Croft, Captain Harville and Elizabeth...Mary was a bit over the top but still satisfactory. However, as `Persuasion' is one of favourite Austen novels, I was immensely disappointed by the fact that vital dialogues were inadmissably overlooked, especially in the final scenes - you just cannot change the ending. Apart from this, this version is excellent &amp; is far superior to the older BBC version which lacked the romance &amp; passion that makes the novel such piece of mastery.
1878424319|5.0|Looking at some of the reviews for this book it is easy to see that there is quite a bit of disagreement here.  Some say that the book is too simple, some say the book is too complex, and some say that it was a complete waste of paper.  Well, I agree with all of these claims.  First off, the book was very simple and that was the genius of it.  The simpler the book the larger the audience.  I don't think that Toltec wisdom could have been explained to the everyday man any better.  Secondly, the book was too complex and aside from the actual four agreements, I am not sure that everyone could follow his examples and concepts without some prior reading.  Finally, I can agree that this book was a waste of paper.  There is nothing new in this book, except for maybe the stories.  The four agreements could be regarded as the cliff notes to Carlos Castaneda's &quot;Journey to Ixtlan.&quot;  But keep in mind, Ruiz isn't exclusively talking about Toltec wisdom in his books, he pretty much is just explaining his philosophy and practice.  <br />Why five stars then?  I found the book to be entertaining and a light refresher course on the points in &quot;Journey to Ixtlan.&quot;  Aside from that it was also a quick pleasure read that is easy to practice as soon as you put the book down.  I can't recommend a better spiritual book to the general public.
B000056VIY|5.0|I was a wee bit worried when I began to purchase Jennifer Lopez's latest release.Her previous CD was kind of a disapointment.When I got home I opened the CD and put it in the CD player and man was I impressed.J.Lo's music has improved so much since her first CD.Most of the songs are absolutly wonderful.Jennifer's voice has most definatly improved as well as her lyrics.Definatly an improvment!I recamend this to any pop music fan.
B00004XOWN|5.0|I was sceptical when the young kid from across the street brought this cd over and said it was \\"great\\". After playing it, I was a bit shocked by the language but a few of the tracks really grabbed my attention like Rollin, The one and Getcha groove on. It became a listening addiction and I avoided giving the disc back for a few weeks. The day I gave it back was the day I went out and bought it! Now I cant bring myself to taking it out of the car stereo system. It's been 3 months of non stop \\"Limpin with the Biskit\\". AWESOME MUSIC. Must now go and find their previous work. PLAY IT ON FULL AND BLOW OUT YOUR SPEAKERS !

B000002UB6|5.0|I've been listening to &quot;LET IT BE&quot; a lot, lately. It's always been one of the Beatles albums that I listened to and liked most, despite the fact that it caught a lot of flack from critics. The criticism is not unfounded. Some of the material here is over-produced, the playing is rough and unpolished, some of the songs sound almost unfinished, and studio chatter has been left in between tracks. In my opinion, however, these elements aren't always things to be taken negatively. This album was based on live recordings. While other Beatles albums were always flawless studio productions, this album is the closest they ever came to a live album. Rough edges have been part of some great recordings, and I think that applies to &quot;LET IT BE&quot;. The comments between cuts and the rough production give it informality and charm. Further, I hear an intensity and raw emotion that come across more intensely than in most other Beatle recordings. In &quot;Two Of Us&quot;, John and Paul sing of their long friendship and partnership as they anticipate going their separate ways. I can't listen to this song without thinking sadly of what we all lost when the band split up. Together, they had something very special. The regret and poignancy come across unmistakably. &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; finds John alternately venting his spleen at Paul and anyone else that comes to mind, looking forward to &quot;roll alone-ing&quot;, then wailing &quot;All I want is you&quot;, but &quot;everything has got to be just like you want it to&quot;, reflecting the conflicts that were tearing the band apart. Both are excellent, touching songs.<br />There are other great songs here, as well. George contributes &quot;I Me Mine&quot; and &quot;For You Blue&quot;. Both are catchy and, though the idea behind &quot;I Me Mine&quot; isn't exactly original, it's certainly an apt comment (even now, after all these years). &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot; were classic Beatles hits. &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; are also catchy, but just appear as fragments, here. John's ballad &quot;Across The Universe&quot; is naive but pretty, while Paul's &quot;Long And Winding Road&quot; is the prime example of Phil Spector's over-production. &quot;One After 909&quot; is a bouncy composition from John and Paul's early days. Then there's &quot;I've Got A Felling&quot;, a great rock song and my favorite cut from this album. John and Paul belt this out with an abandon reminiscent of days gone by. This alone is worth having the album, regardless of how you feel about the rest.<br />In my estimation, &quot;LET IT BE&quot; has been too often criticised for what it isn't, rather than appreciated for what it is. This is a great collection of songs, recorded in a raw and informal, but warm and intense, style uncharacteristic of other Beatles albums. Although it was recorded before &quot;ABBEY ROAD&quot;, it has more of the feel of a farewell effort than &quot;ABBEY ROAD&quot; and, I think, says more about what John, Paul, George and Ringo were going through as the Beatles came apart. If I could give it six stars, I would. As things stand, it gets five stars and my highest recommendation. Listen to it with your feelings, as well as your ears.

0812550757|5.0|I was blown away by &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and simply had to find out more of what happened to Ender.  &quot;Speaker for the dead&quot; was certainly no let down (how could it be with a hugo and nebula award?).  Ender himself is not the same person he was in the first book and I missed his childhood persona.  There was less action in this book and less sense of danger but that was to be expected.  Card traded these things for philosophical questions that leave you thinking long after the book has been read.          I wish the relationship between Ender and Novinha had been explored further but it doesn't take away from the book.  Another excellent story by Card.
6302969352|5.0|P>Although countless reviews have been written praising this film and although the film is not a recent one, I cannot but add another word of praise for it. Firstly, it has a very honourable theme, about the honour of being a samurai and their duty to protect the weak and uphold justice. <br />The story is very original and interesting (unlike the Magnificent Seven, remember?). A poor peasant village has been blundered by a group of bandits and these bandits promised to come back everytime harvest time. One of the villagers proposed to hire a samurai (which is obviously inadequate but they are poor, so they cannot afford more) to defend the village but his proposition was opposed by another group of people, fearing that if they fail, a worse tragedy will decend on them. Finally, with the advise of an elder in the village, they set of to find a samurai. And the story begins on how these poor people strive and suffer to find their samurai, occasionally spiced with some humour. <br />Besides the excellent screenplay and acting, the greatest strength in this film is the philosophy behind it. It speaks of courage (e.g. the courage of the peasants to defend their own liberty or the lonesome but skillful samurai who braved the enemy and went into their territory to steal a rifle), of honour (e.g. between the samurais where they respected each other immensely based on a strict samurai code), of the art of war (e.g. on how to lure the enemies in and kill them one by one because, as Sun Tzu said, if the enemy is strong, avoid head on collision), of simple life and love (yes, of course there is a love story, not a major one but enough), etc. etc. And you must watch how this film ends, with so much wisdom oozing out, you suddenly feel you are living among the wisest people

B000003TAR|5.0|'In Utero' is quite possibly the best album of the nineties.  The entire cd (save a few of the interior tracks) is filled with beautiful, pained, and inspired emotion in song-format.  You can listen to the whole thing and feel energized, depressed, enlightened, and a whole slew of other emotions all at once.  I guess this is just an album that you can &quot;feel&quot;.  Highlights of 'In Utero' are &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, &quot;Rape Me&quot;, &quot;Dumb&quot;, &quot;Pennyroal Tea&quot;, and &quot;All Apologies&quot;; however I never skip a track when I play this.  <br />'In Utero' is completely different from 'Nevermind'.  It's less angry and much darker.  Cobain exposed so much more of his mind on this album than on any other.  I think the lyrical content alone is more powerful than a heavy guitar-riff.  Instrumentally, 'In Utero' proves that simplicity is power.  Everything sounds great, period.<br />This is a soulful artistic masterpiece, you won't be dissapointed by anything on it.
0790729393|2.0|Lets examine this movie. It starts out expressing how a few kids are pulling boyish pranks and being kids. Oh kay, lets go on, they go on to pull one prank that ends up hurting someone badly. Then they are ordered to endure a jail sentence in a home for boys. They suffer sexual abuse by kevin bacon and a few other guards. Unfortunately the plot advancement is VERY poor. It jumps around like wildfire and is not the least bit steady. This movie screams, look at me! I am incredible! unfortunately, thats how it feels, it feels like this movie was made just for shock value. After the very poor scenes at the home for boys, we are taken to the next disc. The boys are now involved in gangs and are grown up. The adult actors are mediocre at best, the roles are hollow and dont show very much emotion at all. The adults go on to kill kevin bacon in revenge when they notice him at a bar. Then the boys go on to fix the court so that the two adults will get off. Then the movie goes on to say something like &quot;This and that happened&quot;, its easy to give a happy ending with about 3 sentences isnt it? Unfortunately this movie was not disturbing as some might put it, it promotes homophobia and has poor plot advancement, Robert Deniro is great but the rest of the cast is no less than &quot;okay&quot;. If you like this movie I recommend bless the child... Hrmph
B000002LQR|5.0|BSSM is a great album to introduce people to the pepper's music. they have alot of elements in this album from the rock and funk sound of &quot;suck my kiss&quot;, the ballad sound of &quot;I could have lied&quot; , the rap of &quot;give it away&quot;, the enchanting sound of &quot;breaking the girl&quot; the dark sound of the song &quot;bssm&quot; the catchy lyrics to &quot;if you had to ask&quot; to the greatness to &quot;under the bridge&quot;. if you turn off &quot;sir psycho sexy&quot; because of its wierd sound (or if it sounds too much like a porn star bragging) just fast foreward to after the lyrics and let the guitar sounds put you in a trance-like state, just don't let the sudden 1 minute and 12 seconds of &quot;they're red hot&quot; startle you too much.
B00005LB9O|4.0|I am big fan of Travis (seen them in concert a number of times; check my reviews on most of their releases). On purpose I have waited 2 months to submit my review of \\"The Invisible Band\\" (TIB)<br />At first impression, I really was disappointed with TIB, but I know why: it wasn't the same joy of exploring the unexpected, as was the case with \\"The Man Who\\". I mean, how can you follow up such a brilliant album and not be let down? So I was... and hence the delay in reviewing TIB. If I had rated TIB the day it came out, it would have been 3 stars. With the passage of time, I am rating it 4 stars.<br />The opening track \\"Sing\\" (also the first single) is one of the better tracks of the album, an ode to the joy of singing (see my review of the single). \\"Side\\" is also very good and not surprisingly the 2nd single of the album, with rich string- guitars and a smart lyrics courtesy of Fran. \\"Dear Diary\\" is out of place, quite frankly... a downer song so soon on the album (track 2)? \\"Flowers in the Wondow\\" is a long-time concert fave, although I remember it quite heavier live than on the studio version here. The album moves along quite nicely, too nicely? \\"The Humpty Dumpty Love Song\\" is really good, with its drawn-out outro.<br />In the end, the album overall just doesn't have the same impact that \\"The Man Who\\" had on me. All in all, nice to hear the new Travis album, but it's not the masterpiece that \\"The Man Who\\" was. Let's call this one a \\"victim of impossible-to-meet expectactions\\".
B000002UV1|4.0|mother's milk to me sounds better as instruments than as vocals. parts like &quot;knock me down&quot; and &quot;taste the pain&quot; have their vocal highs, but songs like &quot;punk rock classic&quot; with put us on mtv, all we really need..... sounds a bit wierd. instrumentally, mother's milk is a great album with sounds like &quot;pretty little ditty&quot; makes any musician happy to play instruments. &quot;sexy mexican maid&quot; is a porno fantasy song like its predecessor &quot;sir psycho sexy&quot; on bssm except there isn't a good instrumental part you can fast foreward to. overall, mother's milk is a great instrument album that has been dedicated to hillel slovak, a great guitar player. this album goes great with bssm, just get used to the different sound of anthony kiedis's voice if you listen to it after bssm.
6304025831|5.0|&quot;Casino&quot; suffered critically on release coming so soon after &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. I was lucky to've seen the film for the first time only recently, and I was baffled by the criticisms I'd taken as standard. It's a masterly piece of work. The timing of release was unfortunate; techniques of voice-over, flashback, colour and camerawork were all familiar Scorcese storytelling tools by then, but the overall effect is much smoother and richer than in the first film to suit the 'grander' scenario, very different from the street hustling frenzy evoked in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. DeNiro's role offers him a lot more than Jimmy Conway did and he takes it. Pesci's wisecracking psycopath is allowed significant moments of humanity and sympathy (especially at the end) absent from Tommy in &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (though Scorcese had hoped we would find them). Sharon Stone is superb as De Niro's essentially tragic wife, doomed to hustle herself into the grave. <br />So unlike in so many ways, one useful comparison can be made with the &quot;Godfather&quot; films in that &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;Casino&quot; are basically two parts of a bigger story, Scorcese's ongoing history of aspects of 'our thing'. Unlike Copolla's films which were never intended to be 'true' tales of the mob, Scorcese's are based on solid fact, though it is a tribute to the makers of &quot;Casino&quot; that such a good story was woven from far less complete and open sources than &quot;Goodfellas&quot; drew upon (Henry Hill's priceless account being pretty much put on screen verbatim). <br />The two films are usefully seen as two parts of a symphony, both fantastic and enjoyable individually, better understood as part of a larger whole.
630575067X|5.0|This space fighting, saving Nabbo from the evil darkside of the force film is the best star wars yet. Dont get me wrong the other three where fantastic considering episode four was made in 1977 ten years before i was born. Lucas is one of the greatest directors of all time, to come up with the story of living and fighting in space is a fantastic thing to be able to do let alone making it into the best space film ever made along with the other two follow ups after that. And now to have come up again with another fantastic idea of going back to the days when the evil Darth Vader was a sweet little innocent slave boy Anakin Skywalker hoping to one day become a Jedi knight. There are apparently going to be two more follow ups to the story, where Anakin gets involved with the darkside of the force and ends up being Darth Vader. Episode one - The Phantom Menace is a great start to the classic Star Wars films, with Obi Wan Kanobi still training to become a Jedi master by his master Qui Gon Jinn (played by Liam Neeson). Again trying to save a planet (Naboo) from the evil darkside of the force and picking up little undiscovered Darth Vader who then is Anakin Skywalker wanting to become a Jedi.
B00005ASHM|5.0|First, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is not over-hyped.  But it is anomalous to those who still see the Beach Boys as a garage surfing band or a barbershop quartet. True, their name locks them into an image (Are you listening, Kid Rock?), but take the album on it's merits.  Shut off the lights, lay down, and open your soul.<br />Secondly, This album is a quantum leap beyond anything else done at the time.  The Beatles were gyrating into a red-hot LDS frenzy, and the Satanic Majesties, the Rolling Stones . . . they still haven't grown up.  This albums has a calmer feel.  Compare the angry reds and glitz of &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot; or &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; with the calming greens and golds of &quot;Pet Sounds.&quot;  The Beach Boys were making a farewell album to the sensible 1960's, before the fire storm came.<br />Thirdly, since this is a different album, listen to it with an open mind.  Try to pick out the musical parts and nuances of the pieces.  IMAGINE BRIAN WILSON LIVING TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND WRITING CLASSICAL MUSIC.  What would it be like?  Would we place him between Mozart and Handel? Yes, yes, yes!<br />Additionally, listen to the words.  Mike love would be a good wrapper, but he isn't a poet.  Asher is.  He lives a word, a &quot;logos&quot;--rational speech--to Wilson's music.  This is a spiritual disc: &quot;God Only Knows.&quot;<br />Fourthly, Stereo! Stereo! Stereo!
6302973724|5.0|This is truly a must for Depeche Mode Fan's! Captured on 35mm and showcasing a concert from thier Devotional Tour is priceless. Since they didn't tour for Ultra,this is really the only thing from that pre-era (Dave Gahan-The Rock Star!)What people might not like is David Gahan's constant \\"Oh Yeah!!'s\\" and \\"Sing It!\\"but that's why I like Depeche Mode live like this!This concert beats any re-mixxx's...This is Awesome all the way....The encore \\"Personal Jesus\\" and \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" blow the audience away as will you in your living room!
6304813759|5.0|I'd put off watching this for a long time because I thought, &quot;These guys are going to take it all off?  Erm... I'm not sure I want to see them with it all off!&quot;  But finally, after two years, I worked up the nerve to rent it, and was I surprised.  I found myself sitting in my living room HOWLING with laughter!  These Chippendales wannabes are far from perfect, and they know it.  I think that's what makes it all so outrageously funny.  Having seen the movie once, I only wish the strip scenes had been longer!<br />The dialog wasn't very hard to follow, despite the thick accents.  I was kept laughing throughout.  I'll be watching this one again!
B00005CDUE|5.0|This is a wonderful album, and has been released to celebrate Roxy Musics current world tour;the first time they've been togethr for 13 years. This is a Roxy Music tour and album, NOT a Bryan Ferry tour and album, and as a consequence, it is only right and proper than Ferry's  solo stuff should not be included. I am British and have been a fan since my teens, particularly of Ferry. I was SO impressed that at the concert in San Fransisco they did not do any of his solo stuff; and, he either left the stage, or quietly moved to the back so that the other members of the band took the spotlight. He is, and AlWAYS has been the consummate gentleman.  This album is full of all the songs that made us love them. I am only sorry that Brian Eno got his feather boa in a knot and left them when he did. The songs after him were equally as good, if not better in some cases, but he could have brought a little something extra. This is yet another compilation album, but it is significant because of it's timing. Congratulations to Virgin for releasing this album in celebration of this fabulous reunion!
B00000IBRX|1.0|Yes, that revolting color of pink Pepto Bismol coordinates nicely with this nauseating movie.  I can't believe I watched the whole thing!  I kept waiting for it to get better.  To live up to the rave reviews on the box.  Instead, it kept getting more and more ridiculous.  The story is hackneyed and dumb, the special effects looks like a horrible starving artist painting.  Robin Williams looks embarrassed to be in this movie, as well he should. Don't waste your time.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I only own both Depeche Mode's singles compilations nevertheless I was quite eager to hear the new album by this legendary synth-pop band. Despite some of the mediocre reviews by hardcore fans, I personally found \\"Exciter\\" to be quite good despite my fears that it wouldn't. I was a bit hesitant whether to get it or not but I am glad that I threw caution to the wind and bought it.<br />\\"Exciter\\" is more subdued than some of their older songs like \\"People Are People\\" and \\"Personal Jesus\\". Not that there is anything wrong with that by all means. Dave Gahan sounds so good on this entire cd. I must say that \\"The Dead of Night\\" has some of the corniest lyrics I have ever heard but I loved the synth beats so much I forgave the band for that. \\"Dream On\\", \\"I Feel Loved\\" and \\"Goodnight Lovers\\" are simply superb and are my particular favorite tracks on the cd. The overall mood of this cd I thought had a gothic atmosphere to it with the subdued sounds I heard, dark and morbid. A stunning melodic return for this endearing band.
B00005KHL0|5.0|This version of the classic chiller contains the 12 minutes that were shot for television.  These 12 minutes broaden certain things up.  If you love all the other Halloween movies, then this is one for the collection.
B000002J27|5.0|Genesis certainly didn't suffer as a group just because Peter Gabriel left, as this album shows. Each track is almost an epic in itself, with some wonderful instrumental breaks which have  almost classical overtones. The lyrics have an almost mystical, magical and whimsical feel, in typical Genesis style. I know their later albums got a bit of a bum-rap for being more &quot;poppish&quot;, but this album is true to their prog-rock past. It is certainly a must-have for all of their fans.
0061002593|5.0|I am biased.  I love this book, and have loved it since I first discovered it.  Yes, it is a late Heyer, with all that entails (older hero and heroine, less swashbuckling with Heyer in fact poking fun at a young fire-eater, sometimes slow).  But on the other hand, it has all of Heyer's best features:  humor, wit and irony; an exquisite sense of time and place; wonderfully lyrically descriptions of the North; very realistic descriptions both of the lifestyle of a middle-aged rake and of the uncomfortable road journeys of the day (and the discomfort such journeys could inflict).  And can I say - I love the literary references, the brother who is a bookworm (and who insists on reading even after he is in bed recovering from an accident), the wryly realistic attitude of the heroine towards all men and particularly her brothers,  the realistic attitude that she also holds towards her lover.  It is less poignant than A CIVIL CONTRACT (which is also a strongly realistic Heyer) but which some detest for the less-than-attractive heroine and for what they see as Heyer's snobbery.  <br />This is not a tale of high adventure, and yes, Heyer has written that type, particularly in her earlier years.  It is a tale of a beautiful young woman who has nevertheless resigned herself to spinsterhood and to life as the hostess for her younger brother who is unlikely to marry.  Into the neighborhood however comes a rake, who is a slightly unlikely figure in that he is not handsome nor appealing at first sight.  But he is attracted to Venetia and she to him, perhaps united by their shared sense of the ridiculous. [Warning: Do not read this book on public transportation or in public libraries, if you do not want to draw attention to yourself].<br />The story shifts from the North of England to London, and back to the North again.  Unlike most of Heyer's heroines, Venetia wants no part of high society or London life;  her great desire is to return to her own area and to life with her dear, wicked rake.<br />As I said, you need to be able to expect a book that is sometimes slow, sometimes full (perhaps over-full) of literary references.  And definitely to possess a sense of the ridiculous of the type shared by Damerel and Venetia.  Don't expect any grand adventures, but the story of a couple who definitely know their minds - and especially a strong, independent but not feisty heroine.<br />This is one Heyer that has remained at the top of my list (along with FREDERICA) for nearly 20 years.  It has followed me from bedroom to bathroom and into the bathroom.  I even have a favorite edition, the one with the pink cover.  Despite my bias, I believe that this book is worth a read for anyone fond of Regency romances or who appreciates a good read.
B00000HYXB|4.0|I've always loved Tolkien's works. From The Hobbit to the Simarillion, he is my favorite author. And Blind Guardian was my favorite power metal band. Combine and you have one of the greatest concept albums ever. &quot;Into The Storm&quot; has that powerful fast beat, &quot;Nightfall&quot; has that dark, medieval feel, &quot;Curse of Feanor&quot; has a shred-mets-death-metal kind of feel, and &quot;Mirror Miror&quot; is just plain majestic. There are a few bad songs though. I wasn't pleased with &quot;Time Stands Still&quot; with the horrible keyboard intro, and &quot;Blood Tears&quot; are ok, just not monumental. I think they overdid with the choir. However, this is a great album if you love Tolkien, Blind Guardian, power metal, or all together. Enjoy!
B000001IPL|5.0|I,ve owned smash for about a year now and I still listen to it every day. I bought this cd because of Self esteem,Come out and play and Gotta get away which I had heard on a hard rock radio station. If your looking to buy Americana because you liked pretty fly and why don't you get a job? and think that there're a great band because of them,STOP! If you really want to know why the Offspring is a great band then by this Cd. Plus the cover art is cool
0790731509|5.0|They just don't make movies like this anymore.  Maybe because of a lack of great actors like Paul Newman, or maybe because it might not appeal to the main-stream audience.  This movie is hard to describe because so little happens in it, and yet, things are constantly going on.  It seemed a little sluggish to me, but, it kept me entertained at the same time.  Maybe it was made like that to demonstrate how life would actually be in jail.  Every actor in this movie does an excellent job, this is one of the few movies that I can't criticize any of the acting.  In my opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once in their lives if not just to become well-cultured.  And, if you don't listen to me, well, we have &quot;a failure to communicate.&quot;
B000002NJS|5.0|&quot;Ray Of Light&quot; has received most of its attention at the electronica angle and it is one of the best albums using electronica ever made. But it is a unique musical work of art. It is not just for fans of pop or Madonna, but for listeners interested in fresh, alluring music. Lyrically and melodically &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; is most likely Madonna's masterpiece and presents some of her greatest vocal work right next to her wonderful performance in &quot;Evita&quot; (film and soundtrack). Here the songs can be deep, but also exhilarating. And they are all intricate in construction. &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; is a wonderful display of sounds. &quot;Frozen&quot; is the gem in my opinion, it is alluring, classical, filled with depth and emotion and an Eastern feel. The songs as a whole seem like selections from someone's dreams. &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; is seductive while &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; is a roller-coster of a song, and an uplifting work, as is also &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love.&quot; Here is Madonna doing more deep, inspired work. Aside from the controversy that has surrounded her, she is a true artist and a groundbreaking one too considering she has basically set-up many of the styles and techniques melodically and on stage that a lot of today's female artists like Britney Spears have tried to duplicate, and if not duplicate, it is obvious they take notes and inspiration from Madonna's work. She is to a lot of today's female pop vocal artists what Jim Morrison is to many rock vocalists. But here she shows that she is incredibly capable of presenting fresh, new and great work. &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; can be wonderous music indeed. This album shines.
0767808460|3.0|Francoise Sagan's works have never quite been realized on film [&quot;That Certain Smile&quot;, &quot;GoodBye Again&quot;].<br />This version starring Jean Seberg, pairing David Niven and Deborah Kerr [great team] as the hapless loves sabotaged by the daughter's love, with the various other inhabitants of the summer villa has quite a unique black and white prelude/conclusion and title sequence.  Juliette Greco [icon!] sings demurely!<br />Slightly soap-operaish, it holds attention, and is rather pretty - that French Postcard look.<br />You'll need a kleenex or two for this one though......
B000053V7Q|5.0|Finally Hollywood has decided to wake up and pay attention to giving Elvis the long overdue credit and positive exposure he has deserved for so long. There will never be another entertainer quite like the calibre of Elvis, giving his fans and the world some of the best and unforgettable music and dynamic performances that will be long remembered.<br />This special edition DVD is a remarkable achievement and portrays Elvis at his absolute peak, knockin em' dead with his enthusiasm and high powered energetic show. I have the original 1970 release on VHS and I am going to either give it away or toss it in the can because this version with it's additional unseen footage is simply fantastic!!<br />The picture quality on this DVD edition was fabulous, never before has anyone had the chance to see Elvis so clearly and so colourful! Not to mention the brilliant Dolby 5.1 sound, Elvis has never sounded better. It's almost as if he is performing in your living room it's that good!!  The only minor criticism I have is that the additional feature entitled \\"patch it up\\" was very brief and could have been more detailed with extra information showing the 35mm to DVD transfer process etc etc. As others have noted some tracks from the original are missing. This is disappointing but hey you can't have everything! Hopefully a second re-vamped version will include these songs but we will see.<br />In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the producers, editors and researchers and everyone else associated with the making of this film on an outstanding effort, the result speaks for itself. Most of all I think we would all like to thank Elvis for giving us the wonderful memories that we have been left with. The world will never be the same without him, but thanks to modern technology we can continue to enjoy his music they way it was intended to be.<br />Thankyouverymuch!
B00004Z459|3.0|It's ok. But the only problem is there's no solos. This would be excellent if it had solos. But, alas, there is none. I have this bad feeling that this will be their only album. Oh well. they aren't spectacular. They have this cliche sound that makes me give it 3 stars. They sound too much like the other bands that are around now. I rather have true metal, like Iced Earth and Blind Guardian, in my stereo, but this is ok.
0375703861|5.0|As I was reading White Teeth, I was asked by a friend 'What's it about?'. I was totally unable to answer this question. Perhaps this is because of the diverse eclectisism that it holds: love, war, race, religion, drugs, London as a city. Yet to say that White Teeth was about any of these subjects would be a misgiving. Surely the only answer to the original question is life.<br />Zadie Smith has created a masterpiece of a book. Three families (four in a way) over three generations weave together to become one remarkable discussion. White Teeth not only tells their story masterfully, but commentates, offering philosophical yet accesible thoughts on the nature of life and the world.<br />One would expect its task to be rather difficult: it leaps around from year to year: begining in the late 70s, finishing in the very late 90s and passing, amongst others, 1857 on the way. Yet its method of flashing-back without seeming cliched in its way of doing so makes it very understandable, and, unlike how many lesser authors' books, you always know which year you are in, if only for what characters are there and what state they are in.<br />The characters are perhaps the greatest aspect of the book. They are comic but they show an obvious seriousness in the unspoken (and sometimes masterfully spoken) philosophical thoughts they imply. Probably the greatest of these are those on race and culture. As for the characters themselves, they are comic and very well realised. <br />And all this from a debut novel! Truly amazing.
078062565X|5.0|KING KONG! Just taste that name. It s t i l l  is a household name. I`m gonna be brief: 2 think that it is made 5 years after Hollywood was transformed 2 sound is amazing. The camera moves, the sound is good(as are the soundeffects), the music, the story and most of the actors are all good. The production values? Stunning. Compare it with CLASH OF THE TITANS from 1981 if u don`t believe me. Fay Wray i s a good screamer but not that much as an actress.  After numerous videotapes I now own it on DVD. Of course it is great but it DOESN`t include the \\"making of\\". Hmmm. Last friday I watched JURASSIC PARK III and went straight home and saw KONG. Well. Hello? In 1933 they at least had something called WRITERS and story developers. A job that may be overlooked by Hollywood these days. KING KONG? A forever treat though his first appearances is difficult to frighten of these days.<br /><br />On January 16 2006, I bought the color version of this film and I have to admit it. IT`S EVEN BETTER in color.
B00003Q438|5.0|James Cameron infuses his action/sci-fi films with real humanity more successfully and consistently than any other filmmaker.  This film tells the story of an isolated group on the ocean floor who must both investigate the sinking of an American nuclear submarine and deal with the mysterious aliens that they encounter.  Ed Harris plays the supervisor on Deepcore, an undersea oil drilling rig.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the rig's designer as well as Harris' ex-wife.  Antagonism leads to rekindled passion during the extraordinary adventure that they endure.  There is one great action set piece after another, some exciting technology (such as breathable fluid) and an effective emotional core to the story.  The culminating sequence, wherein Harris sinks to the bottom of the abyss with only Mastrantonio's voice to accompany him, is more moving than the endings of many supposedly more serious dramas.
0064471837|5.0|I loved this book. It was pretty strange at first, but everything is explained and you get the hang of \\"Garth's world\\". The Old Kingdom (his world) is full of vivid details and imagination. I loved his characters because they developed so well. His characters weren't perfect, they had flaws that they learned from and grew out of. Sabriel didn't always win either. That adds the excitement to the book. Her friend Touchstone grew out of his problem and Mogget, was far from perfect. (Which I applaud because that's what makes a character interesting... I write, so I should know) Mogget was so UNperfect, that he was half evil! Garth Nix deserves a standing ovation for this book! Hip hip huzzah!
B000059T5O|5.0|For those who love hard hitting blues, you will really be missing out if you do not try this album.  John Hammond is at his best. It is gut wrenching blues at its best.
0783240503|5.0|After seeing Andrew Lloyd Webber's classic musical &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; on its third national tour, I knew I had to see more of his musicals, so I rented this, popped it into the player, and - WOW!  From the very beginning, it simply overwhelms the viewer with fun.  The lavish, colorful sets give off pleasant vibes, and you won't be able to stop singing along to the catcy, electric tunes.  There are also the tender moments, such as &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; and &quot;Close Every Door,&quot; which give the musical exellent virety and will bring tears to your eyes.  Best of all, a laugh is never far off, especially for Elvis fans, who will be pleased to see that the King makes a cameo appearance as the king, Pharoh.  Rent this for an exceptionally good time, and be ready for wildness.  Much better than DreamWorks' recent direct-to-video animated version, &quot;Joseph: King of Dreams,&quot; which was obviously released (just a year later) to compete with this.
B00003CXP1|3.0|This extremely deep (and odd) movie will make you cringe and you will definately have a different view on addicts. You follow the life of the main character and those who are involved with him. It is a briliant movie although it is painful to watch. The plot and the characters are so well done that I recommend everyone see this movie at least once.
B000002IWQ|4.0|Counterparts is without doubts, baptized the &quot;partner of Test For Echo &quot;.  I elucidate this viewpoint: While Test For Echo is an album composed of strongless musics, Counterparts is quite more strong, speaking psychologically.  I'm not saying that Test For Echo is better than Counterparts, or vice-versa.  Only I say that exists a &quot;relationship type&quot;  between two albums and is possible to explore  this aspect(Observe: &quot;...To reach the other half...&quot; in Half the World!).  For example, we consider the songs  Resist and Stick It Out as opposite among itself (See this sequence in Different Stages A Live album! Coincidence? No.) Actually, it's true but,   both songs belong at Rushian's 4-phase. Freud analyses... fragility versus force...
1577311523|5.0|This book was recommended over a period by various people from house people to inmates. I have a list of souls I started 2 years ago to discuss and share Conversations with God. Now I just send out what I feel at the time may be appropriate from what I receive and occasionally my own thoughts. It is no longer centered on discussions of CWG.<br />CWG and many other works are more invitations to consider while this book not only does that but invites the reader to apply in very simple ways methods that may result in change in consciousness.<br />This book is aptly titled but will put off many. If one can take their mind out of it and be as objective as they know how it can provide some simple concepts to look at and perhaps apply.<br />I know it has helped me remember my Now. There is no-thing else.<br />As I am also involved with a metaphysical outreach for inmates where I can and I will recommend this book to them. As you can all imagine being an inmate invites many different methods of coping. Inmate or not this book may help many.<br /><br />Be Blessed
B000021Y77|5.0|Run Lola Run is absolutly one of the best movies i have seen. The art concepts and character is amazing. Just the way the video is created using narative, live action, simple animation, series photography, and various video techniques (including: profesional video quality, a home video camera, and various render effects). The actors are also some of the best actors i have seen, and it depicts german city culture/underground very well. This film is an emotional rollercoaster that no one should miss, foreign film fan or otherwise.
0767817486|5.0|Excellent movie. I remember it quite well from when I first saw it in the late 70's.  Purchased the 20 anniversary edition recently and enjoyed seeing it again.
B000059WOD|5.0|this is by far the best c-d i have ever bought. it has got my through some hard times, and i love Joe..just to tell you. Every time i listen to hybrid theory, i fall in love with it all over again. I even wonder how i lived with out it before. I think even if you don't like this sort of music you should give them a chance because they are so talented and i promise you will love yourself for buying this c-d!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If your a fan of Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor or just like the movie this is a must.
B00004U2NX|4.0|When I purchased this film, I had my doubts.  I'm no fan of remakes, particularly after viewing  both the remake of and the 30th anniversary edition for NOTLD (1968). However, I was delighted with Hertzog's of Nosferatu.  He does remain true to the 1922 original while he also brings plot points a bit closer to Stoker's novel.  The film is simultaneously romantic and existential, and truely haunting.  The characterizations are fantastic, Nosferatu (who's meloncholy count struggles with the same qualms as the Bard's melocholy prince). The cinematography captures gothic noir imagery that I have never seen equaled.  And though it is a remake, I believe that this film is a classic in its own right.  As some have already mentioned, the pacing is slow.  The editing is more stylistically similar to that of Kubrick than to MTV.  This is not to say that it comes across as too long or boring, though some viewers may be fidgety at first.  It is very enjoyable.  Finally, I don't know if there is indeed an English dubbed version of the German rendition, but Hertzog filmed the movie once in German and once in English with the same cast.  From what reviewers have said here, I'd stay away from the dubbed edition.  But I highly endorse the edition that was filmed in English.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Nothing deprives this movie of being one of the best in the past decade. The storyline gives the film the image of a fantasy. Billions of young teenagers dream about the day they tag along with their favorite band while they are on tour. But, your parents have other plans. Eventually, you get to miss school and go against your families will. You change from being a quiet bookworm in school to someone that can be called socially existent. This masterpiece also offers witty comedy that you will enjoy every now and then, giving the movie a lighthearted and believable touch. In addition, seeing the bands life beyond closed doors in this proved to be a lot more entertaining than VH1 specials. The ending is memorable and unexpected, to say the least.<br />Most of the acting performances were above average. Patrick Fugit brought about a great personality to his role. He was a peaceful, very smart music fan who endured an experience that made him change from being a starstruck kid to a professional journalist. The band, Stillwater, looked a lot like the bands of its time era, though I wasn't yet born. Frances McDormand brought back the famous overprotective and helpless mother that has been familiar to all teenagers at some point in their life. The only drawback to this movie was the performance of Kate Hudson's character, Penny Lane. I think that this sort of plot does need a female lead like her, but she needs to do something. Her character accomplishes nothing, as far as I am concerned. But, it doesn't hurt the movie enough to kill it. It still is a very engrossing and convincing documentary that really stands out when compared to other movies related to this subject matter. Whether you are a rap fan, a punk rock fan or whatever, this movie will get your attention.

B00005B4GU|5.0|If Kid A was a jolt to you after the transcendent OK Computer, this one will bring you back.  It continues in the experimental vein, but returns to a more song-driven format.  Less energetic than OK Computer, more hypnotic, an album that works seamlessly from first cut to last.  May even give you a new appreciation of Kid A.
B00000IPAX|4.0|When I first heard Blink 182, it was with What's My Age Again? I never really liked them back then. Green Day was my favourite. But, when they put out the hit song All The Small Things, I knew that the album was going to be good. Now, I have tones of Blink 182 cd's and this one is one of the best. It's an awesome cd. Whatever you do, don't walk away from this cd, it's one of their best. Blink 182 is now my favourite band. After this cd, I bought Dude Ranch than Buddha and the list keeps going. But this and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket are my favourites. This album went platinum, so my advice to you, buy it! You'll be sorry if you don't! It's a great pick and it's worth it!
B000002B7O|4.0|The second of two releases Osborne made with Randy Rhoads, Madman showcases some of the finest guitar playing ever recorded. Hyperbole withstatnding, Rhoads playing here is elegant and effusive on &quot;Tonight&quot;, powerful on &quot;Over the Mountain&quot;, and messmeizing on &quot;S.A.T.O.&quot;.  <br />  While some may argue there have been better guitar players, few would argue that Rhoads playing here and on &quot;The Blizzard of Ozz&quot; release were not only essential but seminal in the history of modern-rock guitar playing.
0345350499|5.0|This tail may be a bit harsh on Christianity but it hits the mark on the way Christianity treats any pagan relegion.  This tail also explains alot of the mis-conceptions related to alot of pagan religions.  If you are an open-minded person and would like to know some back-ground information on the Celtic or Wiccan religion, this is a great sorce.  If you believe the tail is true then it is a historical documentary.  If you dont believe then this is just a great story to expierence.
074322454X|5.0|As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I was fascinated by Stephen Ambrose's BAND OF BROTHERS.  An uncle I obviously never knew died on Utah Beach.  My brother was named after him, as is my eldest son.  I first read this book hoping to gain some understanding of what that long-dead relative experienced.  I got much, much more.  Ambrose tells the tale of this band of brothers who landed on Utah Beach and played a part in many crucial events of World War II.  While he tells of these great occurrences, he also recounts some deeply personal incidents.  It is a marvelously researched work.  Read it as soon as you can.
0790734850|4.0|The movie has trouble finding a tone and style at first, gradually develops some of the former, and at the end loses any of either it might have had.  Still, it's very much worth watching for the remarkably rich character development, especially of the various cops.  This in itself puts it outside the noir genre.  I can't understand why Miss Basinger won an oscar (she didn't do much), but then I can't understand why lots of people win oscars.  The Guy Pearce character was terrific, and to me much more complex than others have perceived him.  I think I won't be giving away plot details if I just say that I found it quite implausible that a couple of the characters fell for &quot;Veronica,&quot; given their personalities as developed up to that point.  But then who can understand men? (Being one myself, I'd never try).  I also found the period settings pretty sketchy, and the DeVito character something out of a comic book.  Certainly his &quot;Sidster&quot; was a howler of an anachronism, as was someone's use of &quot;priorities.&quot;  (And the maroon coupe was NOT maroon--or was that supposed to be a subtle statement about police perceptivity?)  But certainly watch the film for the great acting, for characterization that reaches depths you're not likely to see in Hollywood films of ANY era.  Oh, and it builds suspense wonderfully--great plot!
B00003CXAA|5.0|Godfather parts 1 and 2 are probably the greatest films ever made.  I can't wait to get this on DVD collection.
B000002BBY|3.0|Personally, I hate Oasis.  Not their music, but I hate their image.  Here's a band that has great potential, but they're sacraficing lyrical and sonical vision for trying to keep in tradition of the late 60s rock, which I know very little about (I was born in the late 80s, so I really have no interest in the 60s rock).  The sound quality of this CD isn't up par!  It's sounds far too mono and not stereo.  I know that they are trying to bring back some revival, and that's where this album has flaws, and that's why I cannot give this album a higher rating than 3 1/2 stars.  All right, dropping pretensions, this album has let's say 10 songs, and of those, I like or love 7.  Tracks 6 and 7 really aren't songs.  The only three I really don't like are 'Roll With It', 'Cast No Shadow', and 'She's Electric.'  Noel Gallagher's (I chose his voice over Liam's) lead vocal on 'Don't Look Back in Anger' is really the highlight of the ablum in terms of emotion; though their lyrics seem to be stuck in the 60s ditch as well, Noel's voice gives it some passion.  Other songs I would recommend are 'Hello,' a big, fast-paced anthem rocker that is a perfect beginning to the album, and 'Some Might Say' with a good guitar line and nice vocals.  'Wonderwall' is definitely a radio song; it's kind of a wash-over on the album.  However, the saving grace (and the reason I gave this 3 and a half instead of just 3) on the album is the final track, the sweeping 'Champagne Supernova', a seven minute wash of beautiful guitar licks, a nice accordian here and there, and hopeful vocals.  Overall, I would recommend this album over any other Oasis albums.  To put a sticker on this as a whole I would say it's a stadium-reaching accessible roller coaster ride with buzzing guitars and impassioned vocals.  I'm not totally giving up on them yet- maybe I'll buy another album of theirs if they drop the ungrateful Liam and make Noel (with his much kinder, beautiful voice) the lead singer/guitarist.
0060392886|2.0|In 1982, a priest whose moniker has long since escaped my memory published a treatise on human sexuality.  I don't remember much about this delightful tome, except for the fact that it had a cherry-red cover and its opening chapter presented this provocative question, &quot;Is Sex Dead?&quot;  Outlining a cogent theory for the demise of meaningful and transcendent sexuality in an era of over-familiarity, promiscuity and rampant irresponsibility, the courtly cleric nevertheless managed to disgrace himself by condemning birth control, pain relief during childbirth, sexual equality, etc. ad nauseam.  Father Rusty P. Nuss, as I shall call him, squandered his moral capital with my then-23-year-old self with his subtly disguised misogyny and overweening arrogance.  Thus, I nearly forgot about this crimson-covered claptrap.<br />Until I read &quot;The Dirt.&quot;<br />If you think you know how decadent and depraved rock superstars can be, think again.  If you're a groupie and harbor any delusions that you're a muse for your hard-rocking demigod, climb off that pudendal block and join the real world.  If you think you know the real meaning of the term &quot;booty call,&quot; click those ruby-red slippers and remind yourself that you're not in Kansas any more.  <br />What's not to loathe about &quot;The Dirt?&quot;  As it turns out, very few and far between indeed.  Self-indulgence to the point of psychosis!  Telephones used for gynecological tools!  Vomitus as a pheromonal inducement!  Managers, producers, girlfriends, ex-wives and colleagues driven half-mad by the juvenilia of the gents in Motley Crue!  Yes, yes, it's all here - and less.<br />The authors of this depressing book don't mince words - so I won't beat around the, uh, bush either.  &quot;The Dirt&quot; is appalling.  It's disillusioning.  It's perplexing.  But most of all, it's icky.  Of the four band members, Mick Mars and Vince Neil emerge as the most sympathetic.  In fact, Mars asks one of the book's most insightful questions:  &quot;What's wrong with women?&quot;  Believe me, you'll ask yourself the same thing after reading this excremental excursion.<br />However, there are passages in the book that are deeply meaningful.  They involve a beautiful blonde cherub who tragically died of cancer in 1995.  Neil's poignant and heartfelt tribute to his daughter, Skylar, pierces the soul and evokes profound empathy.  As for Mars, his fight with terminal illness and chronic pain hasn't afforded him the luxury to sink to the depths of Sixx and Lee (two immature, impulsive, selfish brats who don't need any more pampering - they need Pamprin).<br />This reviewer remains profoundly perplexed by a lead singer who can concurrently outline a surfeit of sleazy sexual escapades while offering a lovely epistle to his adorable daughter.  &quot;Skylar really showed me what love was,&quot; the singer declared on VH1's &quot;Behind the Music.&quot;  <br />But I'm also annoyed with this band for leading my thoughts back to Father Nuss.  I don't like the idea of placing my trust in the tepid theories of someone who wouldn't know a clitoris from a clavicle, but &quot;The Dirt&quot; is warping my thinking.  At length, I had to take action.  I tore out and reserved all the pages related to Skylar Neil and walked outside in the evening dusk.  Soon I saw a quaint, horse-drawn carriage bearing a newly-engaged couple. How nice, I thought.  How romantic.  This gave me ideas.  I waited for the animal (the horse, not the humans) to pass, and then I placed the book atop a pile of something around which even flies don't congregate. <br />Call me an extremist, but if you'd read more than a few pages of this priapic freak-fest, you'd do the same.
B00004Z459|5.0|Although I think this CD sounds awesome, I believe that the industrial hard-core sound mimics that of a band called STABBING WESTWARD.  Some may have heard of them...  I personally love this sound and am not dissing Linkin Park.  I just think it's funny that no one seems to be mentioning Stabbing Westward's sound in their reviews.  It's an edgy, dark, spine-tingling sound that just makes me want to do something freaky (but not dangerous).  I like the way more &quot;rock&quot; music is incorporating the &quot;rap&quot; sound also instead of just screaming.  Eventually, I think this sound may become more mainstream.
B00005MAM2|3.0|A metal keep case and other special enhancements can't really disguise the fact that this isn't much of a movie.  It doesn't come close to \\"Ghost in the Shell,\\" or other animated classics.  Still for 1988 cell animation, I'm sure it was innovative.  I rented it for [price] and then opted against purchase. I'm sure a lot of folks will now go after the metal case version.  Pioneer seemed to be trying more to manufacture a collectible than to produce an excellent transfer.
B00001OH7J|4.0|As a budding teenaged music fanatic in the mid-seventies, I often heard the name Rory Gallagher whispered reverently among musicians, critics and fans far-hipper than I.<br /><br />Deciding to find out what all the fuss was about, I found a copy of 'Sinner...and Saint' in a cut-out bin somewhere in Chicago and took it home. Disappointed by its flat production and so-so songs, I filed it away and promptly forgot about it and Rory Gallagher.<br /><br />Four or five years later, while a college student in central Illinois, I happened across 'Photo Finish'. Feeling adventurous, I forked over four or five bucks and took it back to my dorm room.<br /><br />Man. What a revelation! The songs and Rory's playing leapt-off of the vinyl. Rarely had I heard a record lead-off with anything like \\"Shin Kicker\\" and \\"Brute Force and Ignorance\\". I was floored.<br /><br />To make a long story short, I became a Rory Gallagher convert that afternoon. And 'Photo Finish'? I pretty much wore it out.<br /><br />Which is why I was so thrilled to see Buddah's re-issues. The sound is wonderful, allowing Rory's stripped-down, unadorned music to really take wing and fill a room in all its glory.<br /><br />And track-to-track, this is undoubtably his best album. He never sounded so assured. Rarely does 'Photo Finish' falter. Steaming blues, Stax-inspired ballads, full-bore rockers--it's all here. And all good. And all drenched in Rory's sinewy and unflinchingly-honest guitar playing.<br /><br />As shy and unassuming as Rory was in life, 'Photo Finish' remains equally-vivid and attention-grabbing in his passing.<br /><br />Rest in peace, Rory. You were a wonder.
0380973650|5.0|How ironic when the Great American Novel is written by an Englishman!  The absolutely elfin Neil Gaiman earns himself a lasting place in American literature with this novel.  There are echoes of Hawthorne, Melville, lots of Lovercraft, and more than a smidgen of Kerouac here.  While wonderfully providing quirky and fascinating personalities for all his mythic cast, the characterization of the Egyptian cat goddess Bast (a Gaiman essential from his Sandman days) and of Whiskey Jack, from Native American folklore are quite unforgettable.  But most amazing of all, is the precise and flawless capture of the quintessence of the American character.  Mr. Gaiman's scalpel-like intuition and perception of who we are as Americans is awesomely brutal and unflinching.  Few writers born on this side of the Atlantic understand and portray it a quarter as well.  This would be an excellent choice for academic study, but that detracts nothing from the fast-paced, page-turning excitement and sheer joie de vivre.  Life-affirming literature and a rollicking good time --- can't ask more of a novel!
6304539258|4.0|&quot;Star Wars&quot; represents the fourth chapter in Lucas' stellar space opera, subtitled &quot;A New Hope&quot;.  The movie as a whole is very entertaining.  When you put into perspective that the technology they used, while state-of-the-art at the time, was limited, the storytelling was done to a key.  &quot;A New Hope&quot; introduces us to the movie industry's most popular characters, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Han Solo, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Darth Vader, in an epic battle against oppression.  The film stretches across intricate worlds, bringing us to Tatooine and Yavin as the Rebel Alliance figures how to dismantle the Empire's most sinister weapon, the Death Star, an object of destruction.  To this day, while the visuals show their age, the idea behind this epic fantasy is completely original and ahead of its time.  It mimics our society through space-age technology and a flashy sci-fi setting, while presenting before us all-too-familiar morals and situations that come right from the pages of an illustrated storybook.  &quot;Star Wars&quot; is still a legend in our time, special edition or not.<br />I greatly appreciated Lucas' attempt to theatrically revive the three films.  Just being able to witness them on the big screen for the first time would've been enough, but the revised special effects added to the excitement, as fresh details made for a more diverse, more modern type of film, while still retaining everything that made it great in the first place.  The main reason I flocked to see it was so I could witness the enhanced footage of Han's confrontation with Jabba, as this prospect had been talked about for some time among fans before ILM decided to put it back in.  I agree, it didn't do much to enhance character development, as the overall conversation takes place with Greedo just moments before inside the Cantina; nevertheless, it only adds to the fun.  And while at the time I didn't think Star Wars needed a Special Edition, the updated Death Star battle was a welcome surprise.<br />The only thing the new effects may hinder is the fact that, a lot of people want to look back at the special effects of old.  I personally find it difficult to revert to the original version having seen the Special Edition, as it's much more polished.  At the same time, the updates don't detract from an already great film, and if anything, it makes the transition that much more easier when you experience the prequels.<br />By no means is &quot;Star Wars&quot; perfect, but it started the legacy over twenty years ago.  And like I said, new footage or not, nothing keeps a good story down.
B0000024TT|5.0|An astonishingly accomplished debut album, Songs is considered by many to this day to be Leonard Cohen's finest album. With more than a decade's worth of poetry and novel writing under his belt, not to mention having written Suzanne, already a hit by two different people before Cohen himself put it out, it's really no surprise that Leonard made as fine an album as he did here. The album opens beautifully with the aformentioned Suzanne, a song which surely needs no introduction, and it continues on with fine songs throughout. Some of them, such as Master Song and The Stranger Song, astound with their poetry; and some in other ways, such as Teachers with it's breathless delivery and interesting musical backing, and So Long, Marianne with it's beautiful arrangement of acoustic guitar, female backing vocals, and pounding drums. This is an astonishing, touching, heart-breaking, and yet redemptory album. I've seen this album come out on top in polls such as &quot;Best Lyrics On An Album&quot; and things like that, and, I don't hesistate to say, it deserves it. A masterpiece, a must-own.
B0000399WI|5.0|I look at anyone who didn't like this movie as if they just escaped from a warped mental institution.  The storytelling and quality acting make for a winning combination.  The experience is moving, and when you watch it from beginning to end, you'll have something to think about for a while.  Its upbeat message will pull you in all directions, and then eventually bring warmth to your soul.<br />Andy Dufresne is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  Within two months of his sentence, he meets friends, such as Red, who make up the little prison family that Andy grows accustom to.  Through his experiences, you'll see first-hand the hardships and emotional twists Andy must endure, as he finds himself coming to terms with his former life, and his current situation.<br />The movie approaches the theme of institutionalization with a pinch of dread, as you come to realize how easy it is to succumb to the protective walls prison can bare, if given enough time.  True, the movie is long, but hardly ever drags.  You're always kept thinking, and if anything you'll be entertained, until the rousing climax.  And no movie's ending has ever captivated me as much as this one's has.<br />How anyone could judge this film so harshly baffles me.  It's not special effects driven, and it's no horror flick.  But as some critics mindlessly claim, it grows beyond hollow, predictable routes.  At its heart is a deeply moving, heart-warming experience about friendship and hope.
6304416415|5.0|HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS is one of the better Disney, live-action films out there. It's original and unique - followed by two [HONEY, I BLEW UP THE KID and HONEY, WE SHRUNK OURSELVES] just as good sequels. This film is about a wacky scientist named Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) who knows all about science and nothing about family or the &quot;real world&quot;. When Wayne creates a shrinking machine, in hopes that it will shrink matter, it actually ends up shrinking his kids, Amy and Nicky (Amy O'Neill and Robert Oliveri), and his next door neighbor's kids, Russell and Ron Thompson (Thomas Wilson Brown and Jared Rushton). They escape from the trash bag and end up entering what appears to be a jungle but is actually the Szalinskis' own backyard! Now, just a few inches tall, the kids must find a way to get to the house and get their parents' attention so they can deshrink them and turn them back to their normal sizes.<br />This is a very funny comedy, and there are some excellent visual effects, too. Everything from the shrunk kids to riding on a flying bee - there is some truly amazing special effects. The plot is solid and so is the acting. This is one Disney comedy I recommend for every family!
630575067X|5.0|I'm simply amazed at how much criticism these movies get, especially with &quot;The Phantom Menace.&quot;  And I'm very pleased, because what exemplifies art more than the critics?  It goes to show that Lucas truly shows his creative roots with these movies, as people draw different interpretations and beliefs from all of them; and no movie in history has ever done this as much as the Star Wars films have.  To me, it's not about who likes or dislikes them, it's the feel that you get when you've seen the whole story unravel.  To some, Star Wars is a film that reflects our society through the use of beautiful, galactic-wide set pieces, and the people who know Star Wars for that usually come off enjoying it, regardless of the hype and what the die-hard fans think of it.  And then there are those who look at the series as a comic book, those who seem to think this one was a little more childish than the classic trilogy, completely forgetting why many people marveled to it in the first place.  &quot;Phantom&quot; got its fair share of criticism, as did Episodes IV, V, and VI, and so does every other movie in history.  People act like &quot;Phantom&quot; was just a bad movie, because it maybe didn't gross as much as was expected, and didn't completely meet others' expectations.  But this belief only comes from the sixteen years of hype that have been following it.  Trust me, there are worse movies in the world, and &quot;Phantom&quot; didn't suffer as badly as people thought.  In my opinion, &quot;Phantom&quot; is one of the greatest examples of storytelling on-screen, and matches any of the classic films, including &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot;  It's no more or no less than what the past three films were, and that trend will continue with however many chapters Lucas decides to tell.<br />That's enough of my political views on the movie.  My job is to review, not debate.  &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is historically the first chapter in George Lucas' epic space opera.  In this movie, we're introduced to the height of the Old Republic, the golden age of the galaxy, the wisdom of the Jedi Knights--and in the background, we have Anakin Skywalker, the boy destined to bring balance to the mystical energy field known as the Force.  With &quot;Phantom&quot;, the start of Anakin's journey becomes an important plot element that will decide his fate, something the wisdomic Jedi Knights, namely Yoda and Mace Windu, seem to understand.  In this huge galactic turmoil that plagues the planet Naboo, we also see the corruption that will mar and eventually bring the downfall of the Old Republic, as Senator Palpatine begins to manipulate anyone who gets in his way to his rise to power.  All of these elements are perfect ground for the forthcoming Episodes II and III, and serve as a basis for &quot;A New Hope&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.<br />In terms of plot, &quot;Phantom&quot; mirrors Episode IV, as it serves as an introduction of what's to come.  Its main purpose is to set up the dark events that will mire the rest of the trilogy, and it does a great job on that level.  There's a lot of movie magic surrounding the mystery of this film, but its colorful atmosphere and wildly amusing characters is what makes for an entertaining film.  Lucas draws from classic film fare, like &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, to continue telling his masterful stories.  Every trace of his imagination and creativity is evident in this film, and how anyone could dream of a more classy, fantastical movie bewilders me.<br />If there's a downside to the film, I thought more attention could be paid to the live-action characters.  George's visual emphasis dominated the very lively world of &quot;Phantom&quot;, as it always has with the original films.  I just think his direction should linger more toward his physical actors, as they're essentially just as important to the story as all the visual details.<br />&quot;Phantom&quot; makes for a very crucial part of an entertaining and deeply involved space story.  As far as its theatrical release goes, it met all my expectations and thensome.  You really couldn't have asked for a better film for what it represents at this stage of the arching story, and for those who continue to bash it, you don't seem to look at Star Wars the same way I do, and you obviously don't fully understand the complex story George has been trying to tell for decades.  I think it was an awesome flick.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna is a superstar that took the world by storm. I think this album, LIKE A PRAYER, was when people started taking Madonna seriously as an artist.

There are also some other great songs on this CD, too like &quot;Love Song&quot;, &quot;Dear Jessie&quot;, and &quot;Pray For The Spanish Eyes&quot;. &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; was the song that everybody talked about at the time this album was released - many people complained about it's religious relation, especially the music video. Madonna is one of my role models - I love her music and this is one of her best albums after THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION and MUSIC. If you are a huge Madonna fan, you must get LIKE A PRAYER. &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; is my absolute favorite Madonna song. This is a must have!
B000001GX8|5.0|I first heard of this music from the film, The Shawshank Redemption. I immediately set out to find out what it was and where I could get my hands on it.  After a lengthy search, I finally found it. To me, the Sull'Aria offered by Gundular Janowitz and Edith Mathis has to be THE most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard. Not only would I not hesitate to recommend it, but I would suggest getting a second copy for when the first wears out!

B00004XMS0|3.0|How can one judge a set like this .  First there is Tim burtons masterpiece Batman.  A movie that word can not do justice to.  It is every bit effective today as when released in 1989 (can it be that long ago?).  His follow-up Batman Return though different is a much under appreciated masterpiece. DeVito and Walken had real chemistry and seemed to have a great time.  Keaton again pulled off the ultimate Batman performance.  All in all a great follow up.  I give both Batman and Batman Returns 5 stars each.  Unfortuneately for the next two movies we fall into the Joel Schumacher years.  Apparently determine to bring Batman back into the the 1960's camp mold, we see the change coming in Batman Forever, but a good performce by O'Donnell as Robin and Jim Carey's stint as Riddler saved that movie.  Forget Kilmer as Batman, he just did not have it. Things then fell apart with Batman and Robin.  Despite a decent show by Arnold this movie was a mess and never gave Clooney a chance to see what he could do in the role.  Batman was a joke again and this movie was an insult and disaster to all Batman fans.  Batman Forever gets 3 stars while Batman and Robin barely scrapes 1 star.  My advice, skip this set and simply buy the first two Batman movies by Tim Burton.
0688152023|5.0|I took ballet lessons a long time ago and was never very good at it, but it was something I always loved. I still remembered some steps and one day decided to try a few out. It felt so good to put my muscles through those motions. It got me thinking and I came across this book. It teaches you ways to move and stretch to give your body a beautiful, healthy shape. Some can be difficult at first, but it does work. It contains step-by-step pictures that make it easy to follow, as well as written directions. In addition to that, it encourages you to stick to the exercises and offers advice on how to really focus on what your body feels to give you a maximum effect. Overall, this is a wonderful, helpful, and even relaxing way to tone your body. For anyone who wants to get in shape, this book in definitely the one to have.
0783241542|4.0|This truly is a good movie, not quite as funny as I expected, but it had some pretty hilarious moments. It is even romantic at times, and really showcases life in High School. This isn't neccesarily a good thing, but its fun jut to sit back and laugh and not really care about anyrthing else. Jason Biggs does a great job as Jim, the poor guy who always seems to find himself in bad, um, situations, which include premature ejaculations broadcasted over the internet, to a number of hilarious encounters with his dad, played by Eugene Levy. All the characters do a great job in this film, but my favorites were Jim, Jims Dad, Finch, and Nadia (not much of a character, but well...). Just enjoy this movie for what it is, a gross-out laugh-fest!
6302799066|5.0|...Kubrik masterminded Dr. Strangelove, loosely basing the movie upon the book \\"Red Alert\\" (the book is a completely serious Cold War nuclear war scenario, but Strangelove is a complete and total farce).  \\"Strangelove\\" came out a year or two after the Cuban October missile crisis, a year after US President John Kennedy was assassinated as well as 2 other contemporaneous films, the brilliant and paranoid \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" and the serious treatment of the same book, \\"Fail Safe.\\"<br />Kubrik originally set out to do a serious treatment of the book. But Kubrik found as he tried to develop the screenplay that he kept running into scenes that he ended up writing as satire. Recognizing the challenge, Kubrik enlisted the talents of one of the best comedic screenwriters in Hollywood, Terry Southern, to do the screenplay.<br />Casting the film was part genius and part hit-and-miss happy accident. ... Somehow Slim Pickens'  name came up and Pickens accepted the role of the B-52 bomber pilot. Even more ironic yet, Slim Pickens was more conservative than Dan Blocker, but Pickens never caught on during the film's production that  Dr. Strangelove was a comedy, much less a satire and a farce unsympathetic to the official propaganda of the cold war.<br />In of itself, it was a comic master stroke telling Pickens play the role seriously. Pickens was apparently no great wit, so Kubrik was able to keep Pickens completely unaware that Pickens was actually playing in a comedy, not a serious war movie (one can only assume that the humor of the situation was not lost on the other cast members, including James Earl Jones who played Capt. Kong's bombardier.. \\"Don't tell Slim this is all a big joke, we have to let him think this is a real war movie.\\" ).<br />Other than Peter Sellers' roles, George C. Scott (later in \\"Patton\\") and Sterling Hayden delivered memorable performances. Both were obviously instructed to play  their roles \\"over the top.\\" Kubrik instructed Scott to overact therole of the cigar-smoking, gut-slapping, martini-drinking & womanizing General Buck Turgidson (get it? Turgid-son?). In the scene in the war room where Turgidson exuberantly proclaims the spectacle of a B-52  bomber evading radar by hedge-hopping, Kubrik instructed George C. Scott to deliberately overact the part. Kubrik had Scott re-take the scene several times, asking Scott to make it even more over-the-top than before. On the last take of that scene, Scott practically performed it as a burlesque parody, which was of course, the final take that Kubrik actually used.<br />Sterling Hayden delivered a brilliant performance as the psychotic Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper, the Air Force general who unilaterally orders the nuclear strike  against the USSR. The confusion of Cold War paranoia, paranoid psychosis and false sexual power in Hayden's scenes is the blackest of black satire. Totally over the top, ludicrous and frightenlingly possible (what if one of your top military brass really went insane and over-rode all the safe-guards against nuclear war?). The insane babblings of General Ripper set the film's direction and act as its centerpiece, delivering both Kubrik's satire of anti-communist propaganda and the air of  impossible odds for the rest of the film's characters to overcome that they might somehow avert doomsday.<br />Peter Seller's performances as the President, the British officer and Dr. Strangelove (a left-over Nazi scientist) are memorable, Sellers delivers the title role as the deranged wheelchair-bound Nazi scientist who suffers from involuntary palsied \\"Seig Hiels!\\" in his right arm. Again sex is the real underlying motive to yet another character and the opportunities for a sexually prodigious post-apocalyptic eugenic world brings the deranged Strangelove to a frenzied outburst of libidinal energy: \\"Mein Fuhrer! I can vwalk!\\" But as much as I enjoy Sellers' roles, they seem overshadowed by the rest of the film's characters. P>It comes probably of no surprise that the U.S. Air Force refused to assist Kubrik in shooting the movie. Having to choice, Kubrik had to resort to mocking up the B-52 flying scenes and bomber interior cabin scenes as best he could (the bomber interior was apparently such a good replica of the real thing that the FBI launched an investigation into who gave Kubrik such a detailed layout of a B-52's flight deck). Appropriately, the exterior B-52 flying scenes hold a comic flaw if you look closely enough: In one scene, as the damaged bomber hedge-hops across the Siberian taiga (northern boreal forest), you can see that the underlying shadow of the plane is actually that of a four-engine propellor aircraft and doesn't match the profile of the overlaid B-52 model.<br />Suffice it to say, when the movie came out, it was not universally received or even widely understood. It was drummed by political commentators and movie reviewers who found it to be tasteless and sophomoric. The studio was very concerned about the potential a negative backlash from its release (consider that in the same year, the Manchurian Candidate was withdrawn from theaters after Kennedy was assassinated). An internal memo described Dr. Strangelove as \\"a huge, sick malefic joke\\" and questioned the wisdom of even releasing the movie at all. After all, the movie starts off with B-52's and tanker planes copulating during mid-flight refuelings, displays Air Force \\"Peace is Our Profession\\" billboards in the midst of a fire fight between the US Army and Air Force security, depicts two Air Force generals as complete sex-obsessed baffoons, one a psychotic and the other a braying ass, delivers a deranged Nazi scientist and finally a cowboy pilot bucking the biggest phallic bronco of his career (never mind blowing up the world).<br />I can think of few other films whose film makers so defied convention and created a story that really turned conventional wisdom on its head. Dr. Strangelove keeps coming at you as one outrageous scene after another, interspersed with segments of complete straight-faced dead-pan, piling them all on until the fateful end. When Pickins died in 1983, CBS news anchor Dan Rather delivered the obituary replete with the out take of Pickins riding the bomb (Perhaps DeForest Kelley topped that and made good on his threat to have \\"He's dead, Jim\\" engraved on his tombstone....).<br />There are some things you just can't live down: Being the face that gets a great closing falling scene that leads to the end of all life on Earth happens to be one of those things. Poor Slim, he's probably suffering in a purgatory of a Liberal Methodist  heaven.<br />In closing, I have to agree with that long-forgotten studio executive who wrote in the memo: Dr. Strangelove *IS* a huge, sick malefic joke. But it is one of the finest huge, sick malefic jokes ever created, and stands as a film masterpiece. Those who extoll the virtues of this fil
B00004Z459|3.0|This isn't really the type of music I'd usually listen to.But there was something mysteriously haunting about a few of the tracks on this compilation,such as the heavily powerful Papercut and Crawling.These guys truly sound like a band on the edge,each member sounding as if they're trying to restrain themselves from killing someone.Contary to other comments which suggest they're a cheap rip-off of them,Linkin Park are far superior to the off putting and ,truth be told,deeply irritating Limp Bizkit (what they trying to prove spelling it wrong anyway?)Even to people who would usually never approach this kind of thing with a bargepole,I would recommend it,it's perfect to listen to one a rainy Friday afternoon at the end of the week.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is back to de-virginize the world. I was one of the people lucky enough to get Lateralus the day before it came out. Even though that's not really a big deal, I was in near hysterics when I got my hands on it. Is it their best album yet? -Yes, by far. Some complain of the album's more wandering style, and that Tool's new sound doesn't quite &quot;fit&quot;. Their change in sound has to do with Lateralus having a WAY BETTER production than Aenima. The new album has crisp, clear, sharp sound that will penetrate you straight to your pineal gland. As usual, the songs are very personal, insightful and memorable. I wouldn't say that any songs are better than others, but this album should be listened to as a whole. Tool is even performing live differently (I saw them for the second time in concert last night in Berkeley). Maynard is no longer dressing up like a woman(!) He was in leather from head to toe, until he shed down to his underwear halfway through. And what's this?? Maynard's playing guitar now? (He picked up a guitar for certain songs, like Schism.) If you haven't seen them in concert yet, you're crazy. One can only admire Maynard's preaching of Sacred Geometry, spirituality, and metaphysics. (I didn't review any of the songs because you just have to &quot;hear it for yourself&quot;.) Don't hesitate to buy this album. As usual, your third eye will be squeegeed clean.
6305311463|5.0|I scoff at all the &quot;serious&quot; reviewers who describe this movie as a lackluster, cheesy &quot;blockbuster&quot;.  This movie has everything you could want from an action movie and makes you feel damn patriotic!
B00003CY5H|3.0|Although not for everyone, The Score will be a refreshing change of pace in a summer of mummies and talking apes.  With a collection of three of the greatest actors in the last fifty years, De Niro, Brando, Norton, the film seems it could be about quantum physics and be interesting.  Frank Oz, usually sticking to family comedies, provides an inside look at the great heist in a very non Hollywood genre film. With Montreal providing a great Euro-style backdrop, the film provides the audience with a script that is very unpredictable and provoking.  While lagging at times, the movie provides the smarter audience with a refreshing look minus the stable shootout ending.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is one of those &quot;once in a lifetime films&quot; for me.  I adored the book and now I own and dearly love the movie.  Amanda Root is perfect as Miss Ann Elliot.  In fact, I can't think of another actress that could play her.  Her longing for Captain Wentworth is almost palpable.  She appears to bloom when she gets to Bath and by the end of the film she radiates.  <br />Anyone with a real love of Jane Austen will adore this film.  It follows the book very well (why do so many screen writers &quot;adapt&quot; Austen's novels anyway?)  I highly recommend this film!
0451169514|3.0|This book like most of Kings works are written solely witht he intent of entertaining, just As Mcdonalds was created with the sole intent of getting you full quickly (but not always good for you).  When you step away from a king book, you have to ask yourself A. Was reading these 1094 pages actually a good use of my time B. Was there an actual lesson from the story? C. Could I have read something else that didn't advocate violence horror and death D. Could I have read something else that had a lesson, or helped me in the constant improving of the self E. Could a teenager with good writing skills write this monster of a dictionary F. Is King really that good compared to the likes of Cervantes Hardy Dickens Tolstoy Nabokov?  This isn't literature, this is mega mass 4000 for your brain.  Its high in calories, but lacking the necessary nutritional value to help the growth of the mind....So do I recommend this book Hell no.  Read something of substinance, read something that makes your mind grow, read something that benefits you, instead of the nightmares that come out of Kings head.  Thank You And a toast to the utter destruction of the Idiot Box.
B000000H5K|5.0|This album bascially describes sepultura...THE BEST!!! Roots by sepultura is the must have album for any metal fan. Sepultura have truly outdone themselves in this album, from the ultimate moshing song - Roots bloody roots all the way to the tribal jam - ratamahatta, this album has it all; the trademark max cavalera (who is god by the way) scream right through to harmonious brazilian tribal music. I defnately reccomend anyone this album if they are in the mood of doing some serious moshing in their bedroom!<br />Till next time this is the soulflying master signing off saying; Eat. Sleep. Drink. ROCK!!!
B00000BKDY|5.0|Released in the fall of 1986, Maiden's pivotal, yet underrated, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; helped diversify the bands sonic arsenal by adding a more melodic approach to their attack.  All of the usual 80's era maiden elements are in full effect; &quot;Caught Somewhere in Time&quot; &amp; &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; rock the rafters, &quot;Alexander The Great&quot; serves as the obligatory 8+min epic while &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Sea of Madness&quot; &amp; &quot;Wasted Years&quot; deliver the arena anthems. Dickinson's voice soars, Harris' bass rumbles, &amp; Smith &amp; Murray deliver some of their most impressive guitar work to date. <br />Unlike previous albums, SIT, advances the bands sound by adding a textural and etheral atmoshpere.  Although this latter point would ruffle the feathers of some diehard &quot;Number of The Beast fans&quot;, SIT, nevertheless captures maiden at their artistic and commercial peak. And of course, the 80's Sci-fi Blade Runner/Star Wars/Terminator album packaging serves as one of the genre's most memorable album covers.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|thats the first thing that comes to mind when i listen to this album. i love this album. i just cant get enough of it. it is right up there with classics such as powerslave, and number of the beast. every song on this gets 10 out of 10, it is just amazing. dont judge it by the first few listens, i didnt like it at first. however, it will grow on you, and you will love it. enough said, buy this if you just like music in general.
B00005B36H|5.0|I heard Aenima and it took a few listens to connect. Like most progressive or complex music for that matter the first listen cannot fully give credence to the overall musical worth. Lateralus is no exception.....with each listen the music takes you deeper and deeper.....Tool has the ability to invite you in with their subtle melodic interludes and just when the moment is at its most beautiful peak it transforms into a progressive onslaught of speed and rhythm that allows you to reap the final <br />reward which is akin to winning the game or a final conquest........the concert in Portland was epic even though  King Crimson only played an hour and most Tool fans were clueless to their greatness.....KC paved the way for Tool....and many others.........
B000059T00|5.0|FOr me, this album is the culmination of the British psychedelic sound of the '60s.  If I have a list of 100 favs, this had got to be in the top 10.  Listen and learn and enjoy.
6305265488|5.0|I loved this movie and I have seen it many times. It is a wonderful new version of the Cinderella story because it is not the typical damsel in distress story. The main character, Daniel, takes care of herself and sticks up for herself, she is head strong and spirited and a role model for women of today. It is an excellent illustration that women are not as dependent on men anymore and we can save ourselves, we dont need any men or princes to rescue us. It still has an element of fantasy and fairy tale and lots of romance, it is intelligent and funny. Overall it is an excellent movie, which I plan to watch many more times. Besides, the prince is gorgeous!!!!
B000056K04|4.0|Oh no--the world has ended!  Dave Matthews has (gasp) picked up an electric guitar to do some new songs!  The horror!  When a mainly electric band decides to &quot;unplug&quot; it is a sensitive musical masterpiece, but when a band that has been accoustic decides to go a little electric, they have &quot;sold out&quot;.  I mean, PLEASE!  Enough already!  I too was hooked on DMB from the &quot;Under The Table And Dreaming&quot; album, and I liked &quot;Crush&quot; equally as much.  &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; wasn't quite as great but still was good, in my opinion.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is not like all other rock (or certainly pop!) albums out there today.  Sure the songs are shorter and somewhat electric, but I don't see them as gaining more radio airplay than the songs off of &quot;UTTAD&quot; and &quot;Crush&quot;.  It is just a different direction for this fine band.  From the opening track &quot;I Did It&quot; to the mystical latest single &quot;The Space Between&quot; to the infectuous &quot;Mother Father&quot; to the more traditional DMB sound on the title track, this is a very enjoyable album.  No way will this get lost in the pop music wasteland of today.  To compare this to Britney, as one supposed DMB fan did, is ludicrous.  This is definitely worth the buy, and I have no doubt this band still has plenty more great stuff to offer.  They should certainly have a much longer career than many of the &quot;grunge&quot; bands who were born and died in the '90's.  DMB fans old and new should embrace this album.
B000009QPE|5.0|Well, they are refering to the importance and depth of this album compared to all of the other music that has been made, released, and copywrighted before and after.  Reign in Blood is to other albums as the Bible is to other books.  <br />If you don't own this album, turn off your computer and go get it NOW.
B000002H97|5.0|You hear all the debates about whether this is Metallica's best album or &quot;the beginning of the end&quot; because of the more mainstream sound that began their &quot;sellout&quot;.  I have to shake my head at this.  While I have enjoyed earlier Metallica efforts (particularly the HEAVY &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot;), this one is simply a great ROCK album.  That is the big picture here to me.  When I am in the mood to play back to back hard rock albums for the ages, I'll choose such albums as Van Halen's debut, AC/DC's &quot;Back In Black&quot;, Def Leppard's &quot;Pyromania&quot;, Guns and Roses' &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot;, and this one.  Who cares that it became popular or why so many people grew to love it?  It is simply a fantastic album.  &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; may be a &quot;simpler&quot; song than on previous albums, but it flat out rocks!  &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; was a totally new thing for Metallica--a first step into melodic vocals--but it too is a fantastic song.  All the tracks that made radio are in fact notable, as are such tracks as &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot; and &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot;--both great rockers.  For fans of true thrash music--I'll agree that this band at this point may no longer be your thing.  For all others who are fans of fantastic hard rock, this is where it's at.
6305537798|5.0|This is a wonderful, funny movie.  The cast is fantasic as well as the story line.  The dialog was also great because it is soooo funny.  You'll be laughing hard at this one.  Some parts were a little unbelieveable (like the school.  It looked like a college) but hey, that's movie business.  I am a big fan of both Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger and I thought they were fantastic in this movie.  Overall, its romanitc but way more funny.
0425107469|5.0|..this is in my opinion koontz' best book.<br />very realistic and entertaining.
B000002H97|5.0|If you buy one album, and only one album, this is the album to buy, cause this CD is the coolest, sickest songs you'll ever hear, including Enter Sandman, Sad but True, and the Unforgiven.
B00004CWO8|5.0|I was amazed when I saw this preformance in NYC and I'm so glad it has been preserved on DVD.  I'm equally impressed that the way in which it was filmed really makes you feel like you're still in the audience watching it and not just watching a music video.  Close ups and camera movements are used but I never felt like I was missing something happening off camera.  Also, audience applause, coughs and laughter can be heard throughout.  That's right, you read that correctly, laughter in a ballet.  There are many instances where comedy has been inserted into the piece and I couldn't be more delighted.  It's handeled effrotlessly by the cast and story and adds to the human connection I feel for the production.  It never feels forced.  And comedy is not the last ime you might be caught off guard durring this ballet.  There are political overtones, fantastic sets, an outrageous bar scene, and of course, the male swans.<br />By changing the swans to males, Mathew Bourne has infused this tale with overtones never imagined.  The swans here are very athletic and much more bird-like in their movements.  It's a daring move and one that adds many new overtones and a raw energy to the story.  It's the single most daring element in a production that's all about taking risks and trying new things.<br />The DVD comes with a small bookett that includes, credits, a synopsis, an interview with and biography of Mathew Bourne.  I can't imagine someone who likes dance not being completely swept away by this incredible production.  Watch it once and you'll want to see it over and over again even though it's magic will stay with you forever.
B00002EPJH|5.0|I have been a Jarrett fan for a number of years particularly of the Cologne concert album and more recently &quot;Whisper Not&quot;.  Rarely have I been so moved by a musical experience.  I am aware that Jarrett has been unwell and that he plays with less gusto these days, however the introspective maturity and tenderness which are so evident in this recording have produced a truly beautiful listening experience.  Every time I listen to it it brings a lump to my throat.  On every listening the impact is as great.  A great one for the middle of the night when you can't sleep! A must for any music lover - let it in!
0767846362|5.0|these movies rocked, i loved the second one the most. the second one is funnier, and the first one has more action. but that still doesnt make the first one better
B000021Y77|4.0|only people who actually think throughout the course of the day need to buy this movie. it's fantastic, but it won't do much for drones and zombies who live most of their lives without ever developing any insight on anything. It's interesting and entertaining at the same time, and it leaves you to consider how time plays such a big role in our lives and our encounters w/ people. If you don't buy it you should rent it b/c it will get you to thinking.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya has consistently been producing high-quality albums with tracks that are soothing, relaxing, and dreamy by turns, and others that fill you with a sense of adventure and lift your spirits far above the clouds. This album is no different, and is perfect for a warm spring afternoon spent lounging in the backyard with a good book or an hour of quiet meditation.
6303921248|5.0|I loved this movie, and I would have to disagree with all the reviewers who thought Mrs. Bennet was overdone.  Her 'over-the-top' character is important to the story, since it makes Darcy's initial objections to Jane marrying Bingley and himself being in love with Elizabeth more forgivable.  It says so in the book (which I've ready many times).  I mean, 'connections' were VERY important back then, and would you want in-laws like that?  I also found her character very amusing, and she is one of my favorite secondary characters.  One of the very few complaints I could think of for this movie is that they left out the scene where Elizabeth tells her mother she is engaged to Darcy, and Mrs. Bennet is struck speechless for a few moments, then goes into raptures about how rich Lizzy will be, and says &quot;...such a charming man!  So handsome!  So tall! ...pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before, I hope he will overlook it....tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it tomorrow.&quot;  I would have loved to see that.  I always think, now aren't you glad you couldn't make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins?  Other than that omission I loved every second of this movie.
B00005M989|2.0|I'm hoping that Prince was not involved with this and that he is rolling over in his artistic grave.  This collection widdles down the much superior Prince / The Hits / The B Sides from 1993 that Warner Brothers released when Prince was leaving the label in the early 90's.  Gone are a few hits (Delirious, Pop Life, I Could Never Take, Batdance - thanks for leaving off Batdance), the R&amp;B hits from his first few albums (Controversy, Dirty Mind, ...), the B-side classics (Erotic City, 17 Days, ...), his versions of songs that became huge hits when covered by others (Nothing Compares 2U, I Feel for you, Do Me Baby, ...).  <br />I can imagine someone defending the omissions by saying that WB wanted to get the very best on one CD.  If so, how did &quot;Get Off&quot; and &quot;Money Don't Matter Tonight&quot; make it on the CD?  It would have been much better to include some of the songs listed above that demonstrate the creative, influential core of the artist.<br />This collection is lost in the 1980's.  By leaving off the first New Power Generation CD (&quot;7&quot;, &quot;Sexy MF&quot;, ...), this collection does not even go as far as the 1993 collection.  And nothing since 1993 has been included (&quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot;, &quot;Letitgo&quot;, would have been good additions).<br />I'm already hearing the collection in music stores and on car radios.  It's great to hear Prince again, even if a former label is selling out the artist - again - and could have made a much better collection EASILY.
B00005K2UF|4.0|New York Voices' latest offering, Sing Sing Sing, does not disappoint!  Fans of the group love their seamless blend and skill in the art of vocalese. This recording offers the latter with verve, with the added bonus of the group's covers of great old standards like the title cut, along with Stardust, Smack Dab in the Middle, I'll Be Seeing You, and others equally as recognizable.  As a longtime fan, the only thing I can ever find wrong with this great group is the solos, which sometimes painfully reveal that voices which are powerful and gorgeous in a blend don't neccessarily have the quality or style I want to hear in a soloist.  But even that weakness provides a foil for what the group does best -- wonderful harmonies, great musicality, and a tight vocal fit that provides lots of exciting sound.  If you are a lover of the vocal arts, this one's for you!

B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia was the winner of seven academy awards in1962, including Best Picture.  That should say enough, but of course, it does not!  This is a movie on the same scale as Ben Hur, Spartacus, and Elizabeth Taylor's version of Cleopatra.  This DVD is director David Lean's uncut version, which is over three hours long.  As always the director's cut is the best!  This movie took two years and three months to complete.  Great movies like this just are not made anymore.  Made in the days before special effects and settings were just mere computer illusions.  Everything is &quot;real&quot;, or as perhaps T.E. Lawrence would say, &quot;Clean.&quot;<br />This DVD version has some outstanding extra features.  Four original featurettes: &quot;Wind, Sand and Star: The Making of a Classic,&quot; &quot;Maan, Jordan: The Camels Are Cast,&quot; &quot;In Search of Lawrence&quot; and &quot;Romance of Arabia.&quot;  There is an exclusive documentary entitled &quot;The Making of Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, which is outstanding.  Also, a conversation with Steven Spielberg, original newsreel footage of the New York premiere, advertising campaigns, and talent files.  As an added bonus there is even a reproduction of the 1962 souvenir booklet.<br />This is an outstanding film that will go down in history as one of the all time best!
B00005BL2A|2.0|Ever since the &quot;Violator&quot; release, I have been dissappointed in each new Depeche Mode CD.  All of their music seems to be a rehash of their more successful tunes.  The rhythms and melodies on Exciter I've heard before on other Depeche Mode CDs.  Violator was Depeche Modes acme, they seem to be out of fresh Ideas. Its a shame but it happens.

014028009X|2.0|This book was pretty good, but I can't say it really lived up to all of the media commotion. The story of a British 30-something woman, who believes that life would be perfect (or at least bearable) if she could stop smoking, limit her alcohol consumption level drastically, find a boyfriend who was not an emotional 'nit'-witt, and lose seven pounds. Each entry starts with a list of Bridget's progress or failure to accomplish on these levels. The book is rather funny as it takes us through her emotional roller-coaster of bad boyfriends, stiff boyfriends, young boyfriends, and every other combination of male hormones imaginable, while contemplating the benefits of remaining a spinster and becoming a 'Smug Married' and even the possibility that she may be pregnant. We hear about her mother's hilarious exploits as the adulterous girlfriend of a Portuguese smuggler. We also get a glimpse of Bridget's private dislike of a body that is bulkier than she might prefer.<br />The benefits to this book are that it is quite normal. We meet a woman who has a job, has friends, and has a dating life. She gets drunk, has sexual relationships, and has insecurities about her appearance--all of these things happening within a moderate degree and not blooming into dangerous, consuming obsessions. She gets embarrassed has superficial crises and then moves on. It is a light and humorous read--although tedious in parts--about the life of a woman who is determined to have it all, but will not cause great tragedy to get it. On the other hand, there is a negative aspect to this book which is rather disconcerting. Is this all that a person in her thirties can amount to? There is a part of Bridget which really does just seem like an overgrown teenager, still obsessed with boys, shopping, and weight. Is this the way a typical adult should be acting? Part of you will say no, part of you will say yes. But overall this is a good read, which is simply meant to be taken lightly.
B000002MX7|5.0|Stellar would be a good adjective for Chaka's voice, except that she also has a beautiful earthy quality that can't be denied. She can wail her socks off like a banshee, or she can sound like a gentle mother singing softly to a baby. And that's when I like her best. If you have the good fortune to come across this cd, you ought to buy it. I promise you won't be dissapointed. It (and Chaka) are great. My favorite song is her version of Billie Holiday's End of A Love Affair. She sings low, then tears the roof off. Get this please. Trust me. It's painful to think of a collection missing this.
0385335482|2.0|I'm a shopaholic and I really liked Bridget Jones' Diary, but this book was a bad clone of the aforementioned book.  The main character was not very interesting and the writing itself was not very good (it was several steps below that of Bridget Jones' Diary).  The best thing I can say is that it's a fast read and, if you're an anglophile, you might be somewhat amused by it.
B000002MP2|5.0|Simply put: With the possible exception of Led Zeppelin's &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; and The Beatles' &quot;White Album&quot; Dookie is the best album of all time!
B000002J1S|4.0|I tell you before Genesis became a Top 40 hit maker machine, they were one creative Progressive Rock Band.  That Tony Banks could create some incredible sounds from his keyboards.  Steve Hackett does the same on guitar(even if in a limited role).  The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway is the last recording that features Peter Gabriel.  Some of Gabriel's vocals are soothing and healing yet others are a bit harsh and grating.  None the less the words and imagery really shine through.  The title track is a thing of beauty but how about the mesemerizing The Carpet Crawlers.  Hairless Heart is an eerie but creative instrumental piece which flows quite creativly into Counting Out Time which features some outstanding vocal harmonies and jarring guitar riffs not too much an oddball keyboard(?) solo.  It features some energetic guitar embellishments and an iterest fade out of Its Only Rock N Roll.  Its hard to beleieve that these guys in all their progressive flavorings sneak in a tribute to the Stones.  Anyway, this recording is quite unusual but mostly in a good way.  Some filler pieces here and there but certainly an excellent recording overall.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day was one of the best Alternative-Punk bands of the 1990's, and they keep it up here with 2000's &quot;Warning&quot;. It's not as good as their classic &quot;Dookie&quot;, but with their classic three-chord guitar riffs, and their complexs lyrics, Green Day is always a fantasic band
0780020685|5.0|Akira Kurosawa has made an indelible mark on film history, how many foreign language directors have made any significant impact on Anglo Saxon film culture ? Few black and white films of any description have the dedicated fan base of Seven Samurai & Yojimbo, fewer still have inspired copies of any value...Should Seven Samurai be dubbed ? With DVD technology I think it probably should, Those of us who read subtitles easily can get insufferably smug and pretentious at times. And I think that broadening the audience base on classics is an excellent idea. With DVD you should have the option. But how can you dub Mifune with any degree of conviction and avoid the perennial lip sync problem ? As to Seven Samurai I think it`s the best of Kurosawas films, I like Ran & Kagamusha and love Yojimbo , but don`t think they are the equal of this epic. For those of you who haven`t seen it, it is the original template for the magnificent seven, only set in feudal Japan not Mexico. It is an interesting exercise to watch one after the other to see how many of the dramatic touches and scenes were lifted from the original almost unaltered. excellent as the Magnificent Seven is, in my opinion it goes beyond the point of being a homage to the original and becomes plagiaristic . Watch both and choose your favorite, you can`t go wrong with either.
6303148352|4.0|Among the criticisms brought to Jurassic Park over the years, the most prominent one seems to be the complete lack of any artistic value and the complete reliance of the movie on special effects. Having viewed the movie a great number of times, I feel compelled to argue against this point of view. True, the dinosaurs do steal the show, but the value of the other elements is almost as evident and praiseworthy. First of all, Michael Crichton and David Koepp's script does magic in limiting the book (which is significantly longer) to an hour and a half of footage that maintains a convincing story line. Secondly, the suspense of the developing plot opens the way for a series of fast-paced action scenes that live up to the movie's thriller nature. Thirdly, extraordinary camerawork, overall construction of the set and creation of a truly breathtaking atmosphere contribute to a re-creating of the past in the present with astounding results. And finally, great performances by Sam Neill (who is perfect as a conventional scientist whose views are shaken), Richard Attenborough (in a triumphant return to the big screen as a genetics tycoon whose dreams end up shattered by disater), and especially an unforgettable Jeff Goldblum (as a sarcastical, good-natured, and foreseeing mathematician who seems to be a prophet for the park's fate). The groundbreaking technological achievments resulted in an almost revolutionary interest in the film.It is this immense success that makes Jurassic Park one of the great movies of the 1990s and one to be viewed by generations to come.
6305903182|4.0|In the third slasher installment to the SCREAM trilogy, a new murderous killer in a ghost mask is on the loose, stalking the cast and crew of the new &quot;STAB 3&quot; film.  Now DEWEY (David Arquette) and GALE (Courtney Cox Arquette) return to get the story behind these killings, and to protect SYDNEY (Neve Campbell).  Yet, killing this one might be harder than they think, considering he is supposed to be &quot;superhuman&quot; and more gruesome.  Leaving behind pictures of Maurie Prescott, SID knows that it's time to end it with the third and final Stab of the Woodsborough Murders.<br />MY REVIEW:<br />&quot;This shockingly fun thriller really knows how to end the trilogy, but it's nothing more than I expected.  The end is satisfying, some of the twists were fun, but some of the acting was just too outdone.  The one problem I had with the end, is that the killer always comes back for one more scare.  THAT IS TOO EXPECTED!  They do that in all horror movies!  Especially the SCREAM movies, they really point it out!  Wouldn't WES CRAVEN figure out that we've gotten passed that????  Who knows.  Yet I was satisfied with NEVE CAMPBELL, DAVID ARQUETTE, and COUTNEY COX ARQUETTE's performances.  <br />The film was overall, chilling- but not scary.  There were some laughs, but a lot of the humor was just dumb.  The ending was a fine way to really END it.  The trilogy idea was great and original.  The main performances were pretty good.  Yet the film was rather expected and typical- until the end- it was still a fun film to see and try to guess who the killer is.  SCREAM III is just a fun, super-charged thrill-fest!&quot;- MJV &amp; the Movies.
B000002JSP|4.0|True, this is not the typical Zeppelin album.  But then again, what is?  Led Zeppelin is a very diverse musical group, with influences from all sorts of genres.  So this is an ideal representation of Zeppelin, albiet the influences of the synthesized era of music that is apparent on too many of the songs. In the evening: As usual, Zeppelin opens up the CD with a hard rocking tune, in the tradition of Good Times Bad Times, Whole Lotta Love, Immigrant Song, Black Dog, Custard Pie, In The Light, etc.  A nice song. South Bound Saurez: Good Piano work, nice catchy guitar rift, and always divine drum work of Bonham.   Fool in the Rain: In my opinion, the best track.  Features a barrage of exotic percussion instruments in the middle section. Hot Dog: Uh, an, interesting song.  Reminds me of the goofy westernesque Ringo Starr songs(What Goes On, Octopus' Garden, etc.) Caroselwhatever:Interesting song, ten and a half minutes of blaring synth work.  Good if you can tolerate 80's music.<br />All My Love:  Nice orchestral work, pretty song I'm Gonna Crawl: A depressing song, a fitting end to the tragic end of this magnificent band's career.  Hearing the desperation and depression in Plants wailin voice, you can almost think he knows of the dire events in the near future.<br />All in all, differnt, very different.
B00003CXP1|2.0|Much like Darren Aronofsky's first film, Pi, Requiem deals with humanities extreme obsessions and addictions and the inevitably dire consequences on the soul suffered through self inflicted damage. Unlike that quite good first feature, Requiem is quite a dissapointment. Often choosing style over content, Aronofsky has put forth an MTV worthy pastiche of quick clips and throbbing 21st century music to depict a nightmarish world of drug abuse with time honored plot cliches firmly intact. Starring such notables as \\"that guy from In Living Color, and that guy from My So Called Life,\\" Requiem is perhaps the most freakishly exaggerated account of drug abuse since the infamous public service film \\"Reefer Madness.\\" At one point a senior citizen imagines her refrigerator trying to eat her and later recieves electric shock treatment to cure her obvious insanity, all because of an addiction to doctor prescribed diet pills. Last I knew, diet pills were not hallucinogenics. Aronofsky's like that weird guy who keeps telling you the story of his friend who took too much acid and is in a hospital thinking he's a glass of orange juice and can't move or else he'll spill, even though you know it's not true. Perhaps the only difference is that Aronofsky takes two hours to tell the story. Just once I would like to see a film about drug addiction where the characters are worth caring about,where there's no blaring techno music or artsy clips of floating .... Darren Aronofsky may still go on to make some outstanding features, but stay away from this one.
6304398395|4.0|There are absolutely no other actors who could protrait Charlie Chaplin as brilliantly as Robert Downey Jr. did in this film, with the look, the physicality and the acting capacity. Period! The actor should have won the Oscar for this. I only wished, after watching it, the film could cover more on Chaplin's film making side.
0385501560|5.0|No, it's not a novel for everyone. Perhaps it should be. To those who say the author's voice, style and subjects are repetitive, perhaps it is because the author has a voice, a style and subjects that deserve revisiting. If I may suggest that most great authors seem to exhibit this trait. This is hardly a commercial, middle of the road novel, anymore than were the author's other works. I won't compare one against the other, each has and deserves a life of its own. I have yet to be dissappointed by any page in any of his novels. If you want a safe comfortable read, look elsewhere. If you are willing to risk experiencing perhaps one of our generations most valid, creative and adventurous voices, buckle your seatbelt and open the cover.
0790731452|5.0|I am in the vast minority of people who love this movie. Let me preface this review by saying that I am not a fan of cheesey 50s sci-fi. I love great films like Seven Samurai,  Citizen Kane and all things Hitchcock. But this movie is right there with some of the great movies on my list of favorites.<br />To sum it up, this is the movie that every 12 year old boy wished to see their entire childhood. This movie sums up how I spent the time holed up in my room playing with my toys. The bad guys invaded, and they blew everybody away. Why? Because it was fun! It was the same story when I played in the yard. My G.I. Joe's invaded the local ant hill and ran over every ant they could find. I also spent a lot of time building models... so I could blow them up with fire crackers!<br />A lot of people just don't get it. &quot;Why did a bird make them attack?&quot; It was just a fun target to shoot at! This movie is about goofy looking aliens that want nothing more than to blow everything away in the most entertaining ways possible. It's absolutely ridiculous! It's great! The adults try to solve everything with reason and peace. Naturally it's the kids who end up the heros in the end.<br />&quot;Don't run. We are your friends.&quot;

B000001GQQ|3.0|This is a noteworthy reading of Prokofiev's concerto.  It's stunning, virtuosic playing, across a range of beautiful colors from pianist and orchestra.  But I find it overly aggressive, and rather heavy-handed.  You won't be sorry you bought this disc, but if you're looking for the best Prokofiev 3rd I prefer Gary Graffman's leaner, better-balanced reading with Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra.
0446605409|5.0|My first DeMille novel, probably wont be my last.  Telling a story from the first person or occasionally modified where the character refers to himself has its limitations, but DeMille seems to do it right.  He was able to keep my attention so that I finished this 574 page book in about two days. This is a murder mystery with a strongly human side (I found myself quite saddened by the loss of a character I liked) and a humorous side (often just too much but I have known people like this, full of sarcasm and bad puns, people who love to tease people that annoy them, very New York).  Detective John Corey is sort of Columbo with more muscle.  Though he he's recovering from a gunfight that almost ended his life, he seems to have more than enough testosterone to do deeds of daring do, along with his courageous female associate.  The assortment of nasty people and bad guys is also well drawn.  Social commentary is strong in this book: DeMille's characters, especially Corey, are able to verbalize what a lot of people feel about bureaucrats, scientists, power trippers, social climbers, and various other characteristics that indicate that many people are missing the point of living a normal human life.  If you like a good escape for a while with a few choice barbs thrown in, this book is for you.  Some of the action is fairly graphic
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I took my son to see it and was amazed that a kids movie could be so fun. Mike Myers is wonderful as Shrek and Eddie Murphy Is hilarious as the Donkey.Cameron Diaz is also wonderful as the princess.A Wonderful story and the animation is outstanding. I would recommend this movie for anyone at any age.
0316776963|1.0|The public was duped into thinking that this would be a book that someone would like to read.  NOT SO!  Yes, it was on the best-seller list, so we bought it.  Bad idea.  Two people in our household attempted to understand this tripe without success.  The book is now resting where it belongs--in the recycle pile headed to the county dump.  The number 1 rating is much too high.
B000003S0K|4.0|Brian Eno's first solo album stars many from the progressive rock movement and the result is a wonderfull slap in the face to art rock as it was known in the early 70's. Whereas art rock generally had deep (or so they thought) lyrics, Eno opted for stream of conciousness gibberish that had a wonderfull sick humor to it. His playing was pedestrian, but he had and has an uncanny ability to texture sounds and treat instruments like nobody before or since. Robert Fripp (King Crimson) rips out one of his greatest solos on &quot;Baby's On Fire&quot;, and &quot;Dead Finks Don't Talk&quot; is hysterical. Any younger alternative fans out there take note. This is alternative years before the term was coined and beaten into the ground by countless bands that all sounded alike. It sounds as menacing, important and downright freakish in 2001 as it did way back in 73. Things got even better on his next release, &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy&quot; and after that he began to move gradually toward ambient music and made his name a legend producing albums for many &quot;New Wave&quot; acts from Devo, Urtravox and Talking Heads to name just three. He also co-wrote with David Bowie on three of Bowie's best late 70's albums. In the 80's he produced some of U2's best work and today he continues to produce as well as compose.
B000002KDZ|5.0|MALO was a sound that kept the latin sound alive.  Carlos was going through the early stages of his &quot;guru&quot; influence.  Raul Rekow, Jorge, Luis Gasca, Arcelio, created a sound, a mood, an identity which everyone could relate.  MALO  maintained my interest (and pride) with their subseqent albums.  Again, with the groups like AZTECA, TIERRA, SAPO; airplay and exposure hurt their potential.  If you had the opportunity to see MALO live, you know what I'm talking about.  MALO is another example of what Latino pride sound like.
B00005JHAB|3.0|This is the type of romantic comedy Hollywood loves - where the guy's sleeping with someone else when he meets Miss Right, and it's soooo cute and romantic to watch him dump his main squeeze for a new one, in the name of love!  Against a backdrop of beautiful scenery, and interspersed with lavish wedding shots - how can you go wrong?<br />The movie opens quite appropriately with a Barbie and Ken doll getting married,  and never strays from that level of emotional sophistication. So if you're looking for a shallow love story with shallow characters who make and break very shallow relationships on a whim, this is the place to be! <br />Definitely not the type of movie you hit &quot;pause&quot; for when you go to get a drink of water, but still sort of fun in a &quot;Barbie and Ken&quot; kind of way.
B000000132|5.0|...You will find it here! Beautiful orchestration! Great blend of clasical styles &amp; rock 'n roll with a smooth, homey, folk music feel. All this and it is tied together with the voice of an angel!<br />The underlying tone of the album follows a rare and wonderful anti-communist sentiment.  Starting with &quot;Running Hard&quot; and concluding with &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, it follows a most dramatic programatic music style that will speak to you while it knocks your socks off at the same time.  <br />I will not spoil it for you by trying to describe the actual songs, since it is best to build your own interpretation.<br />Grab a good, strong cup-a-joe, your favorite snack and pretend that you are at some club because you are going to be blown away from the first note like it is the first time you went to a concert!<br />I will &quot;Think of You&quot; enjoying it also, every time I play it!!<br />:-)
B000006O7C|5.0|This album was released to give an idea of what jeff wanted to express in his next album, but never got to pin down and clean up.  The goal was to put down exactly what he had recorded at the time he left the physical world, ascending to the position he may not have wanted.  He clearly didn't like people focusing on the past so much that they didn't look to what new things we could do, what new places we could find.  He also didn't subscribe to the obsession over musicians as idols(&quot;this entire show is dedicated to cuervo tequila and people magazine, both of which lead to...delusion&quot;-live in chicago).  But his thoughts put down here, which sometimes gently woo our sentimental hearts, and other times stab through our cold apathy, left him in a position to be some sort of legend; the memory of jeff was subject to poking and prodding by those who have a fascination with the death of someone known by many.  But he lives on in many people's minds as an inspiration to move forward, taking new roads, to embrace spontaneity and all emotions we feel.  Studio recorded demos comprise the first disk.  The second: mostly 4-track home recordings while alone in Memphis.  The final song on the second disk is a celebration of the time (short or long) that we have among the people who we can choose to love, an idea that jeff expressed consistently through his recorded life.
B000003TAB|4.0|Unlike all the other Nirvana albums, I can't sit through this one. The songs are alright, but on the other Nirvana albums, EVERY-SONG is a #1 hit. They had huge expectation, and I guess they got too nervous. Good album never the less, but unless you're a die-hard Nirvana fan, you're not going to like this album. Go for In Utero.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I have always enjoyed Stevie Nicks as a solo artist rather than as a member of Fleetwood Mac. Maybe because the few songs that I do like from Fleetwood Mac were the Stevie Nicks songs. Although a fan of her music, I just  never got around to buying any of her albums until &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;. What got me to start checking out Stevie's music is the sample Destiny's Child used in their latest single &quot;Bootylicious&quot;. The &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot; sample reminded me that I need to start listening to her music.<br />&quot;Every Day&quot; is a pop/rock nugget that showcases Stevie's raspy, smokey vocals at her finest. I adore this song and the perfect single to kick off Stevie's new album. I did not need to read the credits for &quot;Sorcerer&quot; to know that Sheryl Crow was involved with this track. &quot;Sorcerer&quot; has Sheryl's distinct country/rock/pop sound written all the sound, blended wisely with Stevie's vocals. One of my very favorite tracks on the cd. Every song on this cd is wonderful. Mixer Chris Lord-Alge does an brilliant job on bringing out Stevie's voice on this endearing album. Sheryl Crow's contributions to the album adds a touch of country, rock and pop to Stevie's music which wasn't heard in the past. I hope fans don't have to wait another 8 years for another solo album from Stevie Nicks.
B000031XCR|5.0|I love news song, and others. That's the way it is is the best song on this album for me, and BUY IT NOW!! :)
B00005BF9Z|5.0|I'm not really familiar with Manu Chao's music except for the track he contributed to Madonna's awful movie &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; called &quot;Bongo Bong&quot;. And to be perfectly honest I found that track painfully annoying to listen because of the repetitiveness of the lyrics. After seeing CNN's Worldbeat do a segment on this unfamiliar artist (for me) and one of his videos on MTV2, I thought he was worth checking out. Much to my surprise I found myself loving this album immediately on the first listen.<br />Track #11 &quot;Mr.Bobby&quot; has the same melodies to &quot;Bongo Bong&quot; and perhaps is the english version (I assume) but I liked this track a lot. It sounded really good. &quot;Denia&quot; is another particular favorite track off &quot;Proxima Estacion: Esperanza&quot;. It is a bit on the folksy side which I enjoyed. I really appreciated that there was a few english tracks to break the monotony of listening to an entire cd of sung in spanish (I believe but could be wrong). &quot;Proxima Estacion:Esperanza&quot; is a funky little cd that totally caught me off guard.
B00004Z459|5.0|mad cd. not too soft and not too hardcore. these guys really know what their doing. there isn't a single bad song on the whole cd. in fact, it's so good, i even bothered to write a review for all the guys who still haven't got it yet.
0060931736|3.0|Think of yourself as a 10 year old in the environment of a stagnated, uniformed, processed school for girls in the 1930's. The teaching is conservative and safe, so as not offend the sensibilities of the children or the parents. Into this steps Miss Jean Brodie, a teacher just entering into her 40's who discusses her love life, her vacations, her disagreements with the administration and the other teachers at her school. There isn't a lot of actual work you do in her class. This teacher is more interested in teaching you about obscure knowledge or about subjects that have nothing to do with the course. In fact, she seems to want to discuss whatever happens to be her interest at the moment. There's not a lot of actual work in the class but she does take you to art galleries, operas, botanical gardens and the like. You would think she was a cool teacher, right? Then you have entered into the world of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. <br />It's easy to picture Miss Brodie as similar to Plato and the other philsophers of Athens as they attracted young aristocrats into their circles and put radical ideas into their minds. The girls in her classes are much too young to hold their own intellectually against her so they become more like worshipping disciples to Brodie's take on life. Brodie would be in as much trouble in the present day as she would in the 1930's. For good or bad, education in the public sector is founded on conformity. Anyone rocking the boat at an educational institution is generally looked on with suspicion or even resentment. The fact that the other teachers could not form relationships with their students like Brodie did added to their conspiracy against her. <br />The Prime of Miss Brodie traces the relationship of one group of girls from the beginning of their contact, and through transitions to the future, the ultimate end of their relations.  You get the sense that Brodie believes herself a heroine to be emulated, a person who is superior to everyoneelse, a demi-god of education. The fact that facism is mentioned more than once is a clue to the book. It hints that she thinks of her girls as flunkies or lesser shadows of herself that only serve to reinforce the fantasy of her life. The fact that she refers to her 40's as her prime shows that she is afraid she is already past it. <br />I liked this book but I would call it &quot;slight&quot;. By that I mean there's not a lot going on in it. I just didn't want to call it shallow. I didn't feel challenged by it really. It didn't push any envelopes of thought or form. Ironically, the feel of the novel has all the tinges of a conservative mind that fits the novel into a nice little frame. This book would have no problem being taught at a conservative, stifled, and repressed school. I guess that means I'm rebelling against Dame Muriel Spark.
6303407161|5.0|full of moral's and emotion's dialectic. But I always feel the director like to made(create and control) emotion. His movies are artificial...anyway I knew Relph Fiennis from renting this video two years ago and since then I've been his fan.

0452282152|5.0|This book takes you back in time seamlessly, without the reader needing a moment's pause to understand the differences in setting or social status.  It's as if it is the world we have lived in our entire lives; the simplicity of it gleams from the writing to the characterization of Griet herself.  Before you know it, you are as taken with her as everyone else. Her simplicity reveals more than had she screamed.  This is a wonderful read, unfortunately, I could not put it down and was done in an hour.  It reminded me of the recent best seller &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha.&quot;
B000002BBY|5.0|'What's the Story Morning Glory' is not only Oasis' finest album to date, but probably always will be. Noel Gallagher and co. will be hard pushed to ever release an album of this quality again.<br />Released during the height of BritPop fever in 1995, 'WTSMG' reminds the world how talent, musicianship and the need to play an instrument were once needed to achieve fame in the music world (compared to today where all you need is a manager, skimpy costumes and the ability to mime (a bit) ).<br />Contrary to popular belief, Oasis are not mere Beatles copy-cats, but they create their own unique style drawn from a variety of classic rock influences, including T.Rex, David Bowie, The Who, but mainly the Beatles.<br />The album contains essentially ten tracks (with two instrumental fillers), the most well known being 'Roll With It', 'Wonderwall', 'Don't Look Back In Anger' and 'Some Might Say'. But the album doesn't stop at these tracks. There's the brilliant 'Hello' which kicks off the album, the title track, and of course the ending song 'Champagne Supernova' (which I think is Oasis' finest ever). 'Hey Now' is without doubt the most underrated song from the album, and 'She's Electric' would have been more at home on Oasis' first album, but is still a fine track.<br />A great introduction to one of the 90's greatest groups, and one that should stand the test of time.
0064407667|1.0|I have to hand it to Lemony, he got off to a good start.  But afterwards, he just starts to drone on and on, and simply put, it gets boring after a while.  I myself fell victim to buying the first five books and reading them, but jeez! does Lemony Fresh or whatever his name is start to drone on.  &quot;Gahgo&quot; said Sunny, (the baby) which probably ment something like, PLEASE STOP WRITING THESE BOOKS, PEACHY SHMICKETT OR WHATEVER YOUR DUMB PEN NAME IS!!!!
B000025XX0|5.0|Released shortly before Freddie's death in 1991, Greatest Hits 2 is a fitting tribute to one of (if not THE) greatest bands of all time.<br />The album covers queen's highlights from the early 80's to the early 90's.  During this period, Queen's fame rocketed to even further heights around the world but, sadly, declined in America.  To any American people wanting to know if Queen still had 'it' after the 70's, the answer is YES, and even more so.  Greatest Hits 2 is arguably better than the first.  Whilst none of the tracks here may not match the likes of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' or 'We Are The Champions', we are left with a much more consistent compilation.<br />The album kicks off with 'A Kind Of Magic', a soaring pop hit.  The other more mainstream hits include 'Radio Ga Ga' and 'I Want To Break Free,. 'Who Wants To Live Forever' and 'The Show Must Go On' are two of the most moving ballads Queen ever produced.<br />What sets this compilation apart from the first though, are the harder, rockier songs.  Queen's stadium rock songs seemed to rock harder than ever before.  This may explain why this album isn't as universally appreciated as the first. 'I Want It All', 'Breakthrough', 'Hammer To Fall' and 'One Vision' still get my adrenaline rushing every time I hear them. 'The Miracle' and 'Innuendo' proves that Queen still had that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' style in them.<br />This is an album no Queen fan should be without, if you are not familiar with these hits, please take the risk and get this album - you won't be dissapointed.
B0000027RL|5.0|This record was the responsable that  I became a Pearl Jam Fan but with the years I realize that this isnt their best record just the most comercial one, because is the only one where you see videos and live performances almost everywhere, and the time when it was release had a lot to do, just imagine vitalogy or yield in that time with all the videos that Ten had.  What make this record special is Eddies GREAT voice.   I dont say this is a bad record I`m just saying that other records dont have the credits they should have.  But if you Like music you will enjoy this record, and if you don`t you will too.
031286504X|5.0|I AM LEGEND is a terrifyingly bleak tale set in a world that has gone horribly wrong.  Robert Neville is the lone survivor of a plague that has killed everyone in the world and then reanimated them as vampires.  By day, he searches for answers and tries to reduce the ranks of the undead.  By night, he is besieged by the ghoulish hordes, led by his former neighbor and friend Ben Cortman.  His sanity threatening to give way, time is running out for Robert Neville.  Matheson succeeds in breathing vivid life into his horrific tale.  These ghouls populate a world that we know all too well, not some far-away nether world. There is no safe distance from this story.  We see our world, our everyday, mundane world, twisted into a nightmarish landscape of relentless fear and ever-present death.  Read this novel.  It is a classic that will continue to endure.
6305132984|5.0|West Side Story is an old but all time movie which got 10 well deserved Oscars. The music, by Leonard Bernstein, is great. It is sometimes vibrating and vital, others romantic, but always powerful. The musical themes have different dozes of jazz, popular and ballads ingredients and the classical music background of Bernstein is also  present (just listen to the overture and you will see). The choreography is quite distinctive, full of energy and it's daring and agresive. West Side Story is more a modern opera rather than a film with some songs and dances. I know that there are some people that did not like the film (hard to believe) but most did. This is perhaps not a movie for just any audience, it is mainly for music lovers who also like modern/jazz dance (if you like classical music, operas and musicals and enjoy jazz and/or if you find pleasure in listening to Grofe, Aaron Copland and Gershwin, then I am sure you will like this film, but if you only enjoy hearing Ricky Martin, Roxette, ABBA, and so on, forget it, you are maybe better off trying something else). I have seen the movie several times (I never get tired) or just listened to the music which I also have in CD (even more, I have every version of the music which I know of that has been released). As this film is mainly a musical, if I were you, I would make my choice (to buy or not to buy) based on your musical taste (and nobody can judge that better than yourself).
079073804X|5.0|The Exorcist is one of the classic horror films of all time, obviously, so I needn't comment on the film itself. This review is directed to the DVD. If you're looking for The Exorcist on DVD, the one to get is the 25th Anniversary Special Edition, NOT the newer &quot;Version You've Never Seen&quot;. The Director's Cut is nothing special at all. The new scenes are completely unnecessary (the only one of interest is the brief spider-walk scene) and only detract from the power and quality of the original film. <br />The 25th Anniversary Edition is also a better DVD than The Version You've Never Seen. It has the same extra footage (but in a supplements section, not in the actual movie), two audio commentaries, one by director William Friedkin and one by writer-producer William Peter Blatty, and the 74-minute BBC documentary, &quot;Fear of God: The Making of The Exorcist&quot;. <br />I really hope that Warner does not discontinue the 25th Anniversary Edition DVD and keep only The Version You've Never Seen in print. Try to track down the 25th Anniversary release if you can. The original 1973 film is the one to own.
B000000993|4.0|this record is nowhere short of great. the all time great is the second song. a trip on the emotions.
B000005DQR|5.0|This is a very good CD. It was well worth the money. Anybody who has every been to college, knows of this one weird kid in their dorm who doesn't go to class, stays up all night and watches TV and room kinda smells funny. DJ Shadow was/is one of those kids. You can tell by some of his samples, that he has listened to way to much TV. This is a very good acid jazz CD. Some of the cuts on this CD are very addictive. I am going to buy Preemptive Strike next.
B000001Y5J|5.0|i will never forget this release.This is 100% hate intensity. the lyrics and music energy just beats and beats you. &quot;5&quot;stars Plus+
0804102988|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read.Rutherford covers the history of the Sarum/Salisbury area of England from the Ice Age to the Present Day through the eyes of five families. He moves from generation to generation with effortless skill , capturing the mood and colour of each period brilliantly. As fortunes change and new challenges are dealt with ,we share the lives of many remarkable men and women .All of this is woven into a rich tapestry which is a must for anyone who likes historical novels
B000003TAW|5.0|whoever rated this release any lower than '5'stars must be out their mind. this was one of the best releases of 1994. &quot;surf Wax&quot; and &quot;the Garage&quot; are my favorites. their other releases do not compare to this.

6303984088|2.0|I tottally hate this movie. There were these singing cats that sang :&quot;Everybody! Everybody! Everybody wants to be a cat! Everybody! everybody! Everybody wants to be a cat!&quot; Its about cats and pleased me when i was 5.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|This is a nice Christmas album. You can really see the beautiful voice she has (she's better than any Jessica, Britney, or Mandy out there). She has that 5 vocal range that Mariah has (or that's what I think... she can hit those really high notes like Mariah can). <br />I liked all of the songs she sang. She sang them all well and I really enjoyed listening to them. I wished she could sing with more feeling though. <br />Have A Merry Little Christmas is one of the most beautiful songs on this album. Her voice is full of feeling and it is such a pretty song!<br />Lots of the songs on this album is tinged with a gospel sound. Sometimes at a end of a song you can hear a choir and it turned into gospel and soul. I love this! It gives the songs their own unique flavor. <br />This album is really good. Get it!
B00001QGIQ|5.0|This movie was a better Disney film and old. Its about this wooden puppet that comes alive and wants to become a real boy. (its not scary and not supposed to be), and he keeps lying. His nose grows, and if he ever wants to be a real boy, he better stop lying, and to tell the truth (just like any other disney film) he becomes a real boy with villians etc, trying to stop him.
0440178002|5.0|If you ever want to irritate your Japanese History professor (assuming you ever have one), mention &quot;Shogun&quot; (and pronounce it &quot;show gun&quot; while your at it).  What bothers many of them is not just the glaring historical innacuracies, and there are plenty of them, but the westerners who mange to get through all 1152 pages and assume they're now experts in Japense history.  Let's face it, the Japan in Clavell's Shogun is a fictional world, only slightly more real than Tolkien's Middle Earth.  Don't mistake a work of fiction for a book on history because you'll be sorely mistaken.  Another reviewer has pointed out a few of the martial arts related inaccuracies, so I'll spare you the hundreds of historical and liguistic ones.  <br />To defend Clavell only slightly, Japan's history is an ever changing landscape that can make a newly published history book obsolete in a few years.  You wouldn't think so, but there are some history books on the shelves that paint just as innacurate a picture of Japan as &quot;Shogun&quot; does, and many of them are written by Japanese authors.  That's the nature of the beast.<br />All that being said, &quot;Shogun&quot; is one of my all time favorite books and probably had a little to do with me coming to Japan where I now live.  It's so entertaining that it's easy to forgive all the historical blunders. Easy enough for me to give it a five star review.  <br />Shogun is an adventure story, a tale of forbidden love, and a political thriller all rolled into one.  It may seem impossibly long if you're not used to reading big books, but believe me, it will be over before you know it.  While Clavell's samurai may be flawed historically, they're no less fascinating, and many of the comparisons between the Japanese and Western characters are at least based in truth.  <br />The main character, Blackthorn is tossed into a mysterious and dangerous world where deception is a survival technique and violence is liberally dispensed.  While the charcter begins the story as a stranger in a strange land, he eventually adapts, and ultimately prospers with only his wits to guide him. <br />Blackthorn may be the main character, and the one Western audiences most identify with, but he is not the most interesting.  Toranaga, based on Ieyasu Tokugawa, founder of Japan's last shogunate, is a man of almost superhuman intelligence and charisma, capable of escaping the most well crafted trap and turning the most unexpected events into an overwhelming advantage.  Toranaga is more like a creature of myth than a part of history.  <br />So if you like epic yarn's full of intrigue, adventure, sex, assassination, war, samurai, ninja, sailors, geisha and swords and aren't too concerned about a history lesson, &quot;Shogun&quot; is for you.  If you want to learn Japanese history take a class with an open mind.  Oh, don't mention Crichton's &quot;Rising Sun&quot; either, that one isn't nearly as forgiveable as &quot;Shogun.&quot;
B00003CX7L|5.0|The first Toy Story was really good, and i thought the second wouldnt be as great. But i saw it and it was great, maybe even BETTER than the 1st one. It started out when Woody gets sold to a guy that collects him and the guy wants to sell Woody to a museum. Woody meets all new friends of his kind and wants to leave with them. Buzz gets a crew and heads out to Al's Toy Barn to resue Woody before he is gone forever.......
B00000IMTF|5.0|I know there are already 42 reviews of this album and most say the same thing but i just felt I HAD to add my piece. Blackmore was magnificent with Purple but the recording techniques that must have occurred in the mid 70's allowed Rainbow Rising to be among the greatest hard rock albums EVER. Dio is an absolute freak..who knows how old he was or is now but the man has an astonishing voice that seems to be able to cut through anything. The musicianship never borders on the boring like some technical wankers seem to do, it ALWAYS is relevant, powerful and emotion filled. This is the best album by one of the best bands ever.
B000002NHN|3.0|I find that I agree with the middle-of-the-road reviewer who felt that Ms. McKennitt was in a bit of a rut.  I agree, this album sounds very much like Mask and Mirror, which in my opinion was among the poorest of her offerings.  I truly enjoy the classical references (Mozart in &quot;Dante&quot;) and the care for historical research that Ms. McKennitt displays, but I wish she would couple that with slower, less beat-driven songs, and that she would employ the clarity and simplicity and depth that she showed on her earlier albums.  (I am a fan of her richer lower voice, and I would love to hear more of it. Her upper register is lovely, but she does not have the control over its shading and nuances that she has in her lower voice.)  I also find myself exhausted by the  relentless drive of both Mask and Mirror and Book of Shadows.  Artists should, of course, evolve where they want to go, and if Ms. McKennitt's muse is pushing her ever further toward rock-style beats, more power to her.  I also have no patience with people who want every offering an artist makes to be just like the one before (to quote Madeleine L'Engle, &quot;You've done it in pink, dear, now do it in blue.&quot;)  However, this album seems to me to be doing in blue what Mask and Mirror did in pink, and I found myself wishing for another richly, deceptively simple album like Elemental rather than one that is more superficial and showy. I hope Ms. McKennitt's creativity continues unabated, and I look forward to whatever she does next--but I also plan to listen carefully to the next album before buying it automatically.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I really like the movie, and the music.  This CD is truly unique because it has broadway-sounding songs on it mixed with  all sorts of other songs of the rock/pop genre.  It's a good mix of music.  I highly reccomend this CD to anyone who gets tired of listening to the same thing over and over.  This CD is hard to get tired of listening to.  Also, you can't really appreciate it unless you've seen the movie.  Seeing the movie makes this soundtrack a lot better.  It's not one of my alltime favorite CDs or anything, but it's good so I'll give it 4 stars.
B00003CY5K|5.0|I went with my Mom to see this and was surprised at how funny it was. When I saw the previews, I thought it looked funny; but didn't plan on seeing it. I'm glad I did, because it was very funny. Reese Witherspoon was hilarious. She is a great actress. This is a role totally different than what she usually plays. The supporting cast were also funny, especially Jennifer Coolidge and the UPS guy. If you're in the mood for a laugh, go see &quot;Legally Blonde.&quot;
B000002UAU|1.0|So ....<br />Here's my , track by track , pass / fail analysis .<br />1. Title Track -  Upbeat kick-off . Fairly good . [pass]<br />2. With A Little Help From My Friends -  Ringo's song . The usual poor singing . Usually covered much better ( Joe Cocker etc .. ) . This version nothing special . [fail]<br />3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds -  Imaginative lyric over a repetitive verse/chorus pop tune . The song fails to sustain through the later choruses . John later claimed it had nothing at all to do with LSD etc .......  either way .... yawn . [fail]<br />4. Getting Better - By Beatles standards , a pretty ordinary/dull song . [fail]<br />5. Fixing A Hole - Another nothing-special track . [fail]<br />6. She's Leaving Home -  A sentimental ballad wraps a simple rejection/separation concept . Fine , but doesn't bear repeat listening . [fail]<br />7. ...Mr. Kite -  Silly lyrics ride a 'funfair' soundtrack . Again , really just the one idea  . Dull in repetition .[fail]<br />8. Within You Without You - Crap , compared to George's later efforts ( especially 'Dark Horse' )[fail]<br />9. When I'm 64 - Crap .[fail]<br />10. Lovely Rita... - Clever . Would have made a great single . [pass] <br />11. Good Morning... - Nice driving tight rock sound . [pass] <br />12. The Reprise - Great sound on this track . [pass] <br />13. A Day In The Life - More 'human condition' stuff from the can-be-rather-boring Mr. Lennon . Leads to a pompous resurrection of some orchestral experimentation from the 1920s . Embarrassing .[fail]<br />So , my totals are , 4 passes and 9 fails . Hence , only one star I'm afraid .
B000000IIB|5.0|I must say I was blown away by this collection.It is a Continuous mix frombeginning to end.Disc 1 in my opinionis better because the remixes are simply awesome! Even one song seems to flow nicely to the next.These remixes sound far superior to the original onesbecause they sound fresher and full oflife.Disc 2 is very good but not as good as the first.The remixes are notas fun and catchy .Actually some arevery repetitive.You will want to use the skip button on some tracks.Otherwise it is an essential buyand listen for all Moby and Techno fans.
B000005JA8|5.0|Essential listening for music (electric guitar) workers : check out ' Veteran's Day Poppy ' . The album *is* playful , charming . Plenty of wild ecology stuff in the lyrics . A great collection of songs .
0767824571|5.0|Hilariously funny and unpredictable!  You have to see it!
B000059H99|5.0|Rocky is,plain and simple,a great movie.The story(which everyone knows by now)is wonderful,about a two-bit prize fighter from Philadelphia,who gets a shot at the heavyweight title,and ends up going the distance with the champ. Sylvester Stallone is magnificent in the role of Rocky,and all the supporting players(Talia Shire as Rocky's very shy girlfriend Adrian,Burt Young as her brother Paulie,Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed,and of course Burgess Meredith as Rocky's manager Mickey just to name a few)are equally as good.John G.Avildsen's direction is right on as is Sly Stallones writing. The musical score by Bill Conti is fantastic as well.<br />The 25th aniversary DVD is very good,and priced reasonably.There are some nice special features including trailers(from all five movies)and TV spots.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I saw this movie for the fourth time last night, it gets better everytime you see it!  The acting is magnificent despite all the newcomers.  The storyline is magnificent and appeals to a wide variety of people, even those who aren't big fans of the comicbook (but how could you not be? :P)
B0000508U6|5.0|After releasing Parachutes almost a year ago, Coldplay have gone from little known poms to one of the best bands going around  the world scene. The first time I heard the album was after my brother had purchased it a year ago. As soon as I heard the first song \\"Don't Panic\\" I knew this was going to be great album, and then when \\"Shiver\\" came on I thought to myself I have never heard of these guys but christ they rock, and that was before I heard the \\"Yellow\\".  <br />Now I know I have heard people saying things like \\"there a Dave Matthews band rip off\\" and try to compare them to bands like Radiohead. But when it comes down to it Coldplay are Coldplay and there music is good and theres, if anything there sound is remotly similar to Powderfinger. Whos cares who it might sound like, all the above band are great.<br />A few nights ago on Aug 10th I saw these guys at Festival Hall and was that a show. They started with \\"Shiver\\" in front of a full house. Later on when Chris started singing \\"Trouble\\" he changed some of the words (My Lonelyness) in the song so that it sounded like \\"My Happiness\\" by Hometown band Powderfinger which sent the crowd into a rage. Then Chris stopped and stated that Powderfinger were in the crowd before starting \\"Trouble\\" again. Powderfinger Toured with Coldplay in Europe so chris wasn't scard in giving them a bit ... in a joking way. They played most of the Yellow album and some off the Blue Room EP and 1 or 2 covers. On leaving the hall I saw the boys from Powderfinger who had watched the concert not far from where I had. Awsome concert from a Great Band!!!<br />Recommend buying the Album and seeing them Live. Also recommend Gomez, Powderfinger, George (Aussie Band), Radiohead and Stereophonics all similar music.
0671027344|5.0|This book is one that people, especially teens, can actually relate to. Charlie is a character that I felt that I truely got to know through reading this book. Usually these &quot;coming of age&quot; stories can be &quot;jaded&quot; or even somewhat &quot;cheesy&quot;, but The Perks of Being a Wallflower is very down to earth. The way that Stephen Chbosky writes is unusual in the sense that he seems to become very personal with the characters and allows the reader to do the same. This book was truely a joy to read...all 4 times!
B00000J7JO|3.0|On its own, I guess this album sounds pretty good, and its got the kind of stuff that does well on MTV, but Californication is a disappointment to long-time RHCP fans.  For example, when a person listens to Bloodsugarsexmagik, there are insane funk-rock songs that really make him want to get up and dance, stuff that makes the blood truly red hot.  One Hot Minute was a bit softer, but still had some life in it. Yet this album is like listening to \\"Under the Bridge\\" in 10 different ways.  These guys have a talent at writing ballads, yet what makes the Peppers so special is their funk rock, something that hasn't really been matched by any other band.  ...
B00000J7JO|5.0|First of all, this album contains no explicit lyrics.  One little word in Around The World should not be making this an album with explicit lyrics.  Get On Top also, but its so hard to hear anyway. OK, I got that off my back.  I think this is one of the most beautifully constructed albums ever.  Every song flows into the next one perfectly.  At first I only listened to the first 6 songs, but then I kept going to the almost better back end of the album.  Anthony Kiedis's lyrics sometimes get drowned out on track 14 and I don't really get the reason for the song, but anyway, It starts with Around The World, a throwback a little to the early days of RHCP.  The chorus's are mindnumbing with the funky rap lyrics with Flea's fantastic bass playing.  Parallel Universe is a little new age kind of sound which makes you want to dance.  Scar Tissue is a great kind of ballad but I think its more of just a pure rock song.  Otherside is one of THE greatest songs ever written.  Kiedis's melodic lyrics added by John Frusciante's just unbelievable guitar playing make you want to hear this song over and over again.  Frusciante knows how to get you into the music, when you hear him play, you know its him.  Get On Top is good, with the strong beat sometimes drowning out Kiedis.  It still shows the abilities of the band.  Californication is a very good song, but I don't know if it is worth all the hype that it got.  Obviously, as in Limpbizkit's &quot;Nookie&quot;(not to compare the bands), the lyrics helped it more then it should have.  It gets a little repetitive but has a great guitar solo full of soul from John Frusciante.  Easily is a really great song with a fantastic chorus. Now stop anything you have heard from RHCP for the time of 2 minutes and 45 seconds.  Porcelain is a completely new sound, slow with Kiedis not going hardcore into everything.  Its a great ballad, and the length, though short, is perfect.  I Like Dirt is ok, with a great melodic guitar accent.  Emit Remmus may be one of the only songs I don't like, I like the chorus but it goes on a little to long.  Its not a &quot;bad&quot; song, it just didn't grab me like the others.  This Velvet Glove is great.  Just Great.  A great backing with the acoustic guitar and great lyrics from the chorus: &quot;my will is well&quot; make it a really fun song to listen too.  Tracks 12-14 aren't my favorites and I can't really say anything interesting to you about them.  You'll just have to listen to them for yourself.  Road Trippin'  is kind of haunting with the orchestra and Frusciante's brilliant work with the acoustic guitar.  Great, great song.  I gave you my opinions of these songs, you really have to dive into them with an open mind.  Some of these songs are very new and different from older times of the RHCP.  Really fantastic album though, and it lives up to the hype.
B00004U8JU|1.0|The movie is great.  What more can be said?<br />Well, I'll tell you.  I bought this DVD to replace my aging VHS tape.  The tape actually sounds BETTER!  When Universal had the initial master made, the level of the bass track wasn't right.  When T-Rex walks, you're supposed to FEEL it.  The VHS tape (in THX) and the Digital Dolby DVD both have the bass level set properly.<br />What did they do?  They made a new master (after six months).  They did NOT recall the bad DVDs from distributors.  The new DVDs are available (they sound great), but VERY hard to locate.  They also didn't change the UPC on the case, so there's no way to tell which DVD you're buying, until you open it up.  Finally, they didn't tell anyone that a mistake had been made, so that it could be corrected.  In short, they didn't so ANYTHING that might cost them one cent.<br />How do you tell the difference (other than sound)?  The bad DVD has a code of 'D2R1' on the inner rim of the disk.  The good DVD has a code of 'D2R2' in the same place.
0451167716|5.0|The first time I watched the Godfather I was 5 years old.  Now I am 16 and I just read the book for the first time.  The book is so great.  If you are a Godfather movie fan, then you have to read the book because it will make you appreciate the movie even more, because you will know the full history of every character, and it explains so so much more than the movie.  I know you might think I'm only 16 and that I don't know anything yet, but trust me, this book is the best ever.

B00005MAM2|5.0|This movie is the definitve of anime. It is an incredible movie and it is the best of anime. It is an incredible tale, and it can be compared to some of the greatest sci-fi movies out there. It has alot of thing lacked in a movie, character development and a plot. Its imagery is stunning, if not bloody. The characters are great from the out casted Tetsuo to the cocky Kaneda and the Militaristic Colonel. The story touches on a variety subjects from teenage isolation to corrupt government. I reccomend for any one into sci-fi and any fellow otaku who has not seen it get it. To boot the special features on the two disk dvd are awesome. If you donot have a dvd just get the vhs, It is great and the new dub blows away the old one. Recomended highly
0808514121|5.0|Classic characters and plot.  More of how the more things change the more they stay the same.
0385486804|5.0|I would have never picked up this book just by looking at the cover.   Two people recommended it to me while I was in Alaska last week, and because of their advice, I read it.   It was fantastic!    I could relate to Chris, because of my own searchings and even &quot;escaped&quot; to Alaska in 1985 when I was first married.   I, too, have recommended this book to everyone I know.   Be prepared to have this book haunt you into a better person.
0790736918|5.0|This is a superb classic,for all ages alike! Has everything you want in a western: Guns,Cowboys,Indians,Action,John Wayne! Everybody should see this movie,it was alot of fun!
6303965415|3.0|The glorious interiors, period dress that didn't look like costumes, and the haughty denizens of this thankfully vanished world are delightful.  Very entertaining, but...<br />We had difficulty understanding the dialog against the chattering of birds, background music, clopping of horses, and whatever else was happening in the background.  I'm thinking that the DVD with English sub-titles is the way to go if you haven't memorized the book.<br />The plot development seemed to periodically jump over whole chapters.  I suspect that the original TV version production was chopped to fit into the 104-minute tape version.
B000001GPX|5.0|Personally among my favorite Beethoven works, the symphonies no. 5 and 7 is truly music of power and majesty. Carlos Kleiber, son of the other great conductor, Erich Kleiber, is known as an eccentric. Never having taken a permanent post with any orchestra, he leaves his mark with his few, but legendary recordings.    His interpretation of the Fifth is among the best out there. The tempi he uses are close or right on the mark as Beethoven marked and follows the score to the letter in all other aspects. The first movement is powerful, the second very tender and lyrical, the third majestic, and the fourth triumphant. The balance is superb (despite the excessive reverb of the hall), with the important melodic and harmonic lines always at the forefront.    The Seventh symphony is considered one of his most majestic works, especially the rousing finale. But probably what classical musicians remember most about the Seventh is the haunting second movement. At first glance, it looks and seems to feel like a slow, tragic movement, like a funeral march. However, Beethoven's mark of a quicker tempo (Allegretto, roughly meaning \\"almost quick\\") gives the music an entirely different feel. Kleiber is one of the few conductors who observe the quicker tempo mark and does so beautifully and intimately. Again, Kleiber observes the score with greater detail then many of his colleagues, which comes across with a brilliant interpretation. The first movement seems to have a particularly more fun feel to it, which is continued in the jaunty scherzo third movement. The fourth movement is triumphant from beginning to the rousing finale.    As far as Beethoven interpretations go, this is one of the truest to the score for two of his greatest and most popular works. This should be in every classical music lovers collection, novice and professional, alike.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Rarely have I been dazzled by a movie, especially one with Catherine Zeta Jones in it. However I was truly surprised by this film. Granted that the film is a remake of a 1980 TV miniseries, but so what. For those who have not seen Traffik, the original miniseries, I believe that you will truly enjoy this one. The acting is excellent and the filming is superb.
0671027573|1.0|I started to read this book and was very disapointed. I have read other books by this author, but this book is terrible. The language used is foul and offensive. The heroine is an  obnoxious person, and the plot leaves much to be desired I would not recomend this book to anyone. Don't waste your time.
0201485672|5.0|This is one of the best Java programming book I've ever read, and I plan to reread it ! This book definitevely improves the way you code by providing example of do's and don'ts, together with their justifications. Refactoring, used in conjunction with JUnit (a Java testing framelet), is what could best happen to us OO developers after Design Patterns ! I would recommend the book to any experienced or beginner OO programmer. And, good news, it's fun to read !
B00003CXSP|5.0|I was and still am a big fan of &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot; and when i heard &quot;Hannibal&quot; was going to be made i was excited!! I just bought the &quot;Hannibal&quot; (DVD) and let me tell you it is a treat for the eyes, or for some maybe the stomach no?<br /> The biggest reason for me liking this film so much is the fact i like Ridley Scott and the stunning Julianne Moore, (who fills Fosters shoes very well) This DVD is one of if not the best one i have seen. The presentaion is supberb and not to mention the huge bonus amount of special features. Ridley directs with passion and the cinematography really shows on DVD. From the tense opening scene to the beautiful shots in Venice look outstanding on the region 4 format. <br />As far as the special features go also five *****. The second disk gives you a generous amount of over four hours of entertainment! From angle change functions to deleted scenes it's endless how much fun this second disk provides. It took me three 2 hour sessions to get through everything. What i liked the best was how they show the veiwer how they managed to pull off the graphic but effective special effects, to wild boars.<br />So in closing of my review if you loved this film as much as i did, and you have access to a DVD player get it, love it and enjoy it. This is one film i feel is very special to have in my DVD collection, for it's great substance and presantation, not to mention the film itself. <br />So if you have 35$ to spare don't hesitate in the slightest to buy this film. It is'nt every day a great one like this comes along.<br />                         Five stars!
6305363668|5.0|&quot;Blade Runner&quot; is a hauntingly beautiful sci-fi film. I first saw the film on the Sci-Fi Channel about a month ago, and was so compelled by it, I bought the video. Harrison Ford is terrific as Rick Deckard, an ex-blade runner assigned to kill four rogue replicants. Replicants are artificial humans that were created by the Tyrell Corporation. When a bloody mutiny happened in the Off-world colonies, replicants were declared illegal on Earth, under penalty of death. Special police units, called blade runners, were assigned to kill any tresspassing replicant. This was not called execution, it was called retirement. Rutger Haur's performence as Roy Batty (the leader of the rogue replicants) sent shivers down my spine (&quot;4! 5!, How To Stay Alive!). All in all, SEE THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW!!!
0671024256|5.0|I LOVED this book!  I've been an avid reader since I was a kid, and I've always toyed with the idea of being a novelist.  The thought, however, seemed a bit too far-fetched and extremely overwhelming. I've never known a novelist, therefore I thought the trade wasn't for &quot;normal working people.&quot;<br />I read this book, and his love for writing really touched me.  It made me realize that my dream is one that's worth pursuing, and that's exactly what I've done.  After reading this book I started a manuscript and more or less adhered to his recommendation to write six days a week (to remain intimate with the story &amp; the characters).  Almost six months later I have over 300 pages and will start my peer review process in three weeks!<br />This book really &quot;did&quot; open up a whole new world for me.  I'd recommend it to anyone who's considered writing a novel.  It will make you laugh, will motivate you, and most importantly, you'll love it.

0792107683|5.0|Shane is, in my opinion, the greatest Western ever made.  Alan Ladd was never better than as Shane, a gunfighter trying to escape from his past as a farm hand working for a beleaguered Van Hefflin, a homesteader who is trying to hold out against the cattlemen who want his land.<br />Ryker, the leading cattleman, hires Wilson, the gunfighter, who goads the homesteaders into a fight and then guns them down mercilessly.  Jack Palance never was more effective or more menacing than as Wilson.  Even the dogs knew to avoid him when he passed by.  Two great scenes involve first, Elisha Cook, Jr., as a homesteader who is goaded into a showdown with Wilson, and then the final great showndown where Wilson must face Shane. We have been expecting this to happen and we are not disappointed by the confrontation between good and evil where Shane must reluctantly put on his six-shooter and return to being who and what he really is.  From this action there is no turning back.  It is a defining moment for Shane and a perfect climax for the film.<br />Everything about this movie is excellent.  Each character is perfectly cast, the direction is lean and economical, the actors right on their mark, the story perfectly told, the scenery grand, and the message clear and undeniable.  Fight for what you believe in and goodness will win out in the end. This is an America worth preserving.  These values are worth saving.  This story is worth being told again and again to each new generation of viewers who want to learn what it means to have strength of character and the determination to never, never give up.
B00005B1W5|4.0|THIS IS AN EXCELLENT DVD RELEASE, BUT THEY MISSED SOME THECNICAL STATE OF THE ART, BECAUSE THIS DVD SKIPS S LITLE WHEN PASSIN FRON ONE OF THE FISRT CONCERT CHAPTERS TO THE NEXT ONE...I TESTED ON TWO DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS AND ITS THE SAME..<br />MUSIC IS CUTTED BEFORE IT FINISHES AND STARTS WITH A SOUND SKIP IN THE NEXT CHAPTER....<br />YOU DECIDE!

6304698623|5.0|'A Little Princess' tells the story of a young girl who must go to boarding school, after her father must do battle in World War 1.<br />At first Sara finds it hard to fit in. But with a vivid imagination at story time, and some kind girls, she soon settles in.<br />Written by the same author as 'The Secret Garden'. The reader and viewer know they are in for a special treat. Another one of my fovirites!<br />I love the line that is the title of my review.<br />Recommended for everyone!
B00004X01U|5.0|I bought Madonna's latest release the week it was released back in September of last year.I was expecting an excelent CD from the queen of pop music.What I got was one of the best CD's of 2000.I am still in love with this CD,even after playing it over and over again.This CD is a pop gem that everyone should own.Madonna has really done it again.She has made another wonderful CD and has made her fans very happy.<br />1.Music-The first single off the CD.Great dance tune and one of Madonna's best.<br />2.Impressive Instant-An excelent dance track.It's even better when it's sung live.<br />3.Runaway Lover-Another very danceable track.Great lyrics<br />4.I Deserve It-A slower tune that Madonna sings very,very well.Another great one to hear live.<br />5.Amazing-One of my favorites of the CD.The beats remind me of her song &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;.<br />6.Nobody's Perfect-Another slower song.Brilliant lyrics.<br />7.Don't Tell Me-My favorite song off the whole CD.Great lyrics,great vocals,great video,and AWESOME WHEN SUNG LIVE!!<br />8.What It Feels Like For A Girl-A very cool track from Madonna.

6305537313|5.0|'Breakfast At Tiffany's' is a wonderful movie. The first time I saw it I loved it all! Audrey Hepburn looks so young and adorable in this. But then she looks beautiful in all of her movies. This is my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie!<br />I'm not a big fan of Audrey, but I loved this movie! Delightful!
B00005AR3G|5.0|&quot;Emporer's New Groove&quot; is just terrific! I love this movie! This the type of movie I can show to kids I'm babysitting and enjoy watching myself! The kids I'm babysitting always asks me if they can watch &quot;Emporer's New Groove&quot;. Yzma and Kronk are my favorite characters in the story. And the end where everyone is trying to get the potion is what I think is the best part of the whole movie. The DVD special features are neat, too. There are games you can play, two music videos, and more. Don't miss this one!
6304698690|5.0|'The Secret Garden' tells the delightful story of a young girl called Mary, who becomes an orphan, and is forced to live with her aunt in a huge mansion.<br />At first Mary is a spoilt brat, but after finding a locked and neglected garden, things begin to change. Secrets about her childhood are revealed. She befriends a boy, and discovers a cousin who is an invalid. And teaches a father to love his son again.<br />With the magic and love that grows in 'The Secret Garden', any disability can be overcome.<br />I have read the book and I loved it! I love the movie too! It is beautiful and kind. By far one of my classic favorite movies I have seen. The ending, while very happy, always manages to bring tears to my eyes! It is so beautiful. I also really love the song 'Winter Light' by Linda Ronstadt. Kate Maberly is also delightful! I love the lines 'Colin: 'Are you making this magic?'  Mary:'No you are!'<br />Lovely!<br />I would reccommend this movie for all ages!
052594527X|2.0|What a great concept--taking a breathtakingly beautiful painting and giving it life!  I couldn't wait to read about this lovely girl with the pearl earring.  What a disappointment, what a bore!<br />Much has been written about the author's portayal of a 17th century Dutch household.  True, there's historical information that's interesting, but it was like reading non-fiction, not a novel with well-developed characters and an intriquing story.  The prose was tedious, the style undistinguished. <br />Nothing about the book really drew me in, except the cover--I found myself looking back often, gazing upon that beautiful face and wondering what really was behind the pearl earring.  Maybe there's a book in it.
0780631684|2.0|I thought the story behind 'Final Destination' was great. It has some clever twists and turns. But the whole death issue was a bit too much for me. I don't want to think about that now! I can't watch this movie very often. Too depressing!
B00003CY5K|4.0|This movie was great!  Funny, cute, touching, and it had a great message!  A way above average summer movie!<br />Reese Witherspoon was fantastic as the Elle, the popular sorority president who gets dumped by her boyfriend, Warren because he's going to Harvard Law and she's too 'blonde' for him.  So Elle gets into Harvard in an attempt to win him back! I was really glad that Reese finally got to star in a movie of her own, she really deserved it, she's a great actress!<br />I actually liked this movie a little better than 'Clueless', it had a more entertaining plot and Reese Witherspoon!  A great summer movie.

B000056K04|5.0|Yea, it is different, and it's obvious there's a new producer with this one. But I don't care. It has voice and it has soul and dammit it has electric guitar. The songs still make you want to get up and dance around with your arms waving and your eyes closed and your feet doing something unexplainable.  Buy it. It's good.
B000001G6W|5.0|Of all the great recordings available of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, this one definitely tops my list. This recording, made in 1977, was Herbert von Karajan's third recording of this symphony, and this time he REALLY got it right. Karajan, unlike many others, takes this symphony at a pace which clocks in at just under 67 minutes, compared to the more commonly seen recordings which are generally over 70 minutes. This fast pace has the advantage of making this version much more emotionally intense than the competition. The Berlin Philharmonic play with exact precision and heated fire. Luckily for the listener, Karajan does not make the orchestra play in the overly glossy and smooth manner for which he was to become famous. In fact, he emphasized the brass section in this recording rather than trying to create an equal balance between all sections; this results in an incredibly intense and powerful, blaring brass section, with all of it's member's playing their hearts out. One listen and anybody will notice how this effect greatly enhances the the emotional depth and character of this particular recording when compared to others. The singers in the finale also do a marvelous job(Karajan was famous for picking great singers and getting the best out of them), and though as in ususal Karjan style, the chorus is used more in the background than the foreground, this recording of the ninth emphasizes the chorus more than any other of Karajan's recordings of this symphony. For a recording from the 1970s, the sound is very good. At a mid-price, this recording cannot be passed up. Since first listening, this recording became my favorite of this symphonic masterpiece. Karjan gave us something truly special here.
B000002KBD|5.0|Blue Money was played extensively on the local FM station I listed to as a 14-year old.  I also remember Domino on the airwaves.  I enjoyed both songs.  I was very interested in music, and I particularly enjoyed good lyrics, even then as a teenager. I didn't have a lot of extra money to spend on albums, and I didn't buy this one.  I heard the complete album later when in college,probably 1974/5.  I remember regretting that I didn't buy this album as a 14-year old.  Unfortunately, I missed out and, because of that error, I didn't truly discover Van until college and become a lifelong fan.  I'll Be Your Lover, Too is one of my favorite songs by Van.  The simplicity and mataphor of the song are what makes it so memorable.  Plus, for lack of a better word, the tranquility of the album is superb.  Van can create a mood and atmosphere so easily, and he has done this throughout his long career.  No one can match his output, not even Dylan; his lyrics stand up as poetry by themselves, plus, he's a better musician than Dylan.  Van, thank you for your wonderful music and, almost, a lifetime of musical enjoyment.  Words cannot convey what your works mean to me!
B000002BVN|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. Granted part of me put 4 stars because of &quot;Is It Scary&quot; but overall the album is nice to have. It starts of with &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot;, as what was released to go along with the cd. BOTDF, to me, is about AIDS. Woman using men to get sex and &quot;blood is on the knife&quot; tells me, she's got something and she's giving it away.<br />Next is &quot;Morphine&quot;-strange and different. Very hard song. Hard as in the music that is used.<br />Than comes &quot;Superfly Sister&quot;. Is it just me or is this part 1 of BOTDF saga? Same concept, different gender. Susie is used in this song as well. Susie is hesitant to give herself up to the guy she loves. However, the way I take it is that her guy is messing around with others &quot;Got his Jimmy on the run&quot; (unless those are not the right lyrics). Susie eventually gives it up to him and perhaps by doing so, is used, played and recieved something such as AIDS. And therefore she goes out and plays around because she got hurt and there you have BOTDF. Or perhaps I'm just putting way to much thought in this. :-)<br />&quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Is It Scary&quot;-I'm curious to know which song was produced first, as Mr. Jackson does have the same set of lyrics in both of them. Both are good and entertaining, and like the majority of other Michael Jackson's songs, tells a story. &quot;Ghosts&quot; is about a haunted place...which goes well with his short film &quot;Ghosts&quot;.<br />&quot;Is It Scary&quot; on the other hand is about himself (or anyone else for that matter) and how different he is to others, how he is played as a moreorless side show act (also goes along with his short film Ghosts).<br />As far as the remixes themselves go. I enjoy them, again I'm not one for remixes but they're fun. My favorite remix is the Refugee Camp Mix of &quot;2 Bad&quot; along with &quot;Scream Louder&quot;.<br />I think if you're a fan of Michael Jackson's and/or a remix lover, you'll enjoy this album and I recommend it!
B00003CXDZ|1.0|This looks like one of those movies that people either love or hate.  I won't say I hated it, but I sure didn't love it.  It's too busy, frantic and noisy.  The story is pretty thin and predictable.  The characters are mostly caricatures.  Some of the musical numbers were quite entertaining but overall, I felt that this was aimed at the viewer with a short attention span and a high tolerance for visual pyrotechnics.
6305095566|5.0|hey, all. this is my fav. movie in the world its scary,kind of funny and cool. I saw this movie about 7 times now and i still think its great. the star of the movie is Bruce Campbell known as &quot;Ash&quot; in the story. I have ment Bruce Campbell in a book store a few days ago. the movie starts out when these people go to a cabin deep in the woods. the find a book, skull dagger, and a tape player in the cabins basment. they listin to the tape player and it relesise a evil,dark spirit or i should say a deadit. I would tell the hole movie but i dont want to give every thing away to people that never saw evil dead. you should allso watch evil dead 2 and army of darkness (evil dead 3) also you should try to play the evil dead video game. (buy it for computer and dream cast i dont recomind for playstation.) i have won this game and the ending isent that good. so i say buy this movie!!!!
0743420373|4.0|This is a great book!  The reason I have the title &quot;Compeltely Missed the Point&quot; is in response to the reviewer from this August.  Investing a small portion of your job income every month will build up enough passive income so that you won't need to work for a living the rest of your life.<br />By the way, I know some millionaires who special entities so that they have less of it taxed, in order to pass more on to their kids.
B000002MZ6|5.0|So just what is this CD all about, well its quite simple really, what you do is put the CD in the player, adjust your headphones, sit back, relax, and be prepared to hear the most interesting continuous piece of music ever written, based on a wonderful book. This is truely an album preferred by those that appreciate the finer things life has to offer. While i find that Mikes work is not too well known by many, it is greatly appreciated by those who have heard it, especially this album. The mixture of musical diversity all blended to form one complete song is as good as it gets, and while this has been done before by others, none even comes close to this work. 'The Songs of Distant Earth' has been around my various cd players a lot, and it even stayed in the car one for a while too, although i must admit its not what i would call driving music. This is a worthwhile buy and a valuable piece to add to any serious music collection, the only problem that i have here with this CD is that the enhanced portion is only mac compatible.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India.arie is far beyond the ordinary. Her soulfulness and honesty makes for an amazing album in which she shares her fears, doubts and beliefs. I think pretty much and girl today can relate well to the song Video, and as well as amzing lyrics her songs are catchy too. Video isn't the only awesome song on the album, all of them are! If you like music a little off the main road, you'll love india.arie's Acoustic Soul.
B000003RCY|4.0|Though the lyrics may be in German and a bit sick, I for one find the music very up-beat, cheerfull and invigorating.  Aside from being great at gothic parties it is great music for in the mornings to get psyched-up, ready to tear any non-believers limb from limb :) (blood-dripping fangs not included)
0441003257|5.0|Pratchett of Discworld fame and Sandman Gaiman team up to bring us Armageddon, and the Endtimes have never been so much fun before.<BR> The Antichrist has been misplaced by a Satanic Nun, and the forces of Good and Evil only find out four days before the Armageddon. All Hell breaks loose to find the Antichrist who grew up in a small English middle class family, and behold: the Antichrist isn't that evil at all.<BR> Angels, Demons, God, Satan and even the Four Horsemen (or Bikers) of the Apocalypse show up, and somehow they are a lot different from what our fundamentalist Christian friends imagined.<BR> Gaiman's wickedness adds a dark touch to the looniness of typical Pratchett humor, and every paragraph offers at least one laugh. The numerous footnotes are hilarious, too.<BR> So will Armageddon happen like Pratchett and Gaiman predict it? Who knows, but their vision offers a lot more heart, soul, fun and humor than the uptightness of the evangelical Left Behind novels, and that should be reason enough to purchase 'Good Omens'. More reason is of course the wackiness that will make you wet your undergarments.
0671027573|5.0|I loved this book!  It was a perfect summer read and I just zipped through it.  I was in stitches throughout most of the book yet there is a thriller aspect included.  If you want to escape your worries and housecleaning for awhile then I definitely recommend this book.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I can't begin to express....and all I try to do with music seems to pale...  EVERYONE should listen to this cd, EVERYONE! One cannot listen to the ethereal beauty of this, and not be affected.It's warmth seeps into you,and eventually lifts you up and outward.   BUY IT!
B00000I8NC|5.0|I'll keep this review short. This EP catches Godspeed between their apocalyptic f#a#(infinity) and the heavenly Lift Your Skinny Fists. If you think you'd like that combo, this EP is for you. BBF3 is a decent tune. Very interesting musical shades wrapped around that guy who complains a lot. In all seriousness, there is only one true reason that prevails above all others to buy this. It's Moya. Not just Moya, but when the drums kick in. That second is the most beautifully orchestrated sound Godspeed has yet to come up with. Of course, you have to listen to the whole song. But really, the most amazing part of the EP is when the drums kick in in Moya. If that doesn't floor you, you have no taste in music.
B0000508U6|4.0|I just love the way you can keep playing this album on repeat while attending to other stuff (a paper for example), you get into a sort of timewarp (trance?) and can just keep going and going and going, just like the energizer bunny :)  On the more serious side, I think it's nice relaxing alternative happy melancholical poppy music, yeah, yeah, that's what I think it is.
B000000QFY|4.0|'Moving Waves' was the first LP I ever bought, back in early 1973.  Having bought it purely on the strength of the excitement of 'Hocus Pocus', I was disappointed that the rest of the album was nothing like it.  Focus seemed less a hard-rock thrash-metal band and more the purveyors of a middle-aged, dinner-and-dance style of music.  Hardly the stuff that a 14-year-old schoolboy craved.  Within a couple of years I had sold it, presumably in order to enhance my Steely Dan collection.<br />I have since re-purchased the album on CD, more out of a sense of completeness than for any other motive.  'Focus III' is undoubtedly the band's best album, with 'Hamburger Concerto' placed a close second and 'Moving Waves' third.<br />In retrospect, 'Moving Waves' was a wonderful preparation for the 'Focus III' masterpiece.  Two members of the band -- Van Der Linden and Havermans -- were new, and one should not be surprised that they are feeling their way into the utterly unique sound of Focus.  That said, prog groups of the period clearly listened to each other's work.  There is a striking similarity between the melody of the title song and Emerson, Lake and Palmer's 'Trilogy' -- but which came first?<br />'Eruption' is one of those concept pieces which occupied the entire side of an LP.  Its merits became clearer with familiarity, but it isn't outstanding, and to my ear, it owes much to ELP's 'Tarkus', which definitely did come first.  For their 'Live at the Rainbow' LP, the band reduced the 23-minute piece to a mere 8:29 without much loss of substance.<br />Focus are now an under-rated and much overlooked band.  Availability of this and their other CDs is sporadic.  Snap them up while you can!
B00005K3OT|4.0|Today I watched the film Chocolat, what a  wonderful experience .Finally a  movie where the characters tell the story.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This is a Cd that needs to be in everyone's cd carousel. When I first heard her I said that she was alright. But I bought the cd for someone else and became hooked. Her positive lyrics deliver a powerful message and her beat and tones will relax and calm you in any situation guaranteed.I became more of a fan through a live performance but this beautiful, natural, young lady is surely on a promising road. My most played track are the Intro, Promises, Brown Skin,STRENGTH COURAGE,&amp; WISDOM, Ready for love,Interlude, Always in my head, I See God in You, Beatiful, Outro, and Wonderful. This is a true representation of the positive and spiritual in the world and you won't stop playing the album.
0780622650|3.0|I was the same as most of you thinking before I watch this I will be greatly dissappointed. I really was suprised by how much I liked it and comparing it to the original it is 3 times better. I laugh at people that say the original star trek and star wars, etc was cheesy and lame should watch the original of lost in space. New version-3stars TV version-1 star
6305079811|5.0|Growing up, I thought this was the greatest movie next to Star Wars. As a kid I never realized how cheesy it was, but who cares. I love this movie as much as I did 17 years ago.While the the special effects may seem primitive, they have a unique and entertaining quality about them, I especially like the clouds. This movie provides many entertaining and memorable scenes that fans of cult classic movies will love.Did I mention the super hot Aura or the rocking Queen soundtrack. Hawkmen Diiiieee!
B00003CX5P|2.0|I could not believe how weak this movie turned out to be after the enormous amount of hype surrounding its release.  So many different areas should have been focused on instead of the ones that were.  I am now totally unexcited for episode 2 to come out.  I am much, MUCH more excited to see the Matrix 2, to tell the truth.  And why has it taken so long to release a DVD of this movie?  Where are the DVDs for the other episodes?  WHERE, Mr. Lucas?!?!?!
B0000542DG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. After seeing this movie I learned that it is possible to cheat death. They had an amazing cast. Devan Sawa, and Sean Williams Scott are just two of the many amazing people in this movie. Go rent this movie and see it, it's worth it!!!
B00005LMBK|5.0|this CD is the bomb. first i hated monkeys but this changed my mind. i first heard of it from my friend, and i thought he ment guerillas. like the brazillian guerilla.my favorite track is Clint Eastwood. It makes some sense plus the beat is sick. all you hip hoppers out there this is the CD
B00005MAM2|2.0|I have to agree with all the other reviewers out there that said the english dub is horribly ridiculous. I've seen the old version and it is absolutely incredible! Which is why I reserved my copy of the special edition as soon as I could. But as soon as i started to watch it, it became obvious the second rate job done on the dub. Honestly, I hate it and probably will never watch it again. However, returning it isn't an option because it would cost more to return it then the cost of the movie. So it will probably just sit and collect dust.  On the upside though, the extras are fantastic, and the video clean up is also excellent. This would have gotten 0 stars if it weren't for the upside.   All in all if you've seen the original, don't bother with this version.
B000001Y42|5.0|This CD in my opinion is Limp Bizkit's Best CD to date.  Heavy and melodic.  The CD starts out with a Bang with the track pollution, my faviorate Bizkit song ever.  Even if your not a big fan of Limp Bizkit, but in rap rock in general you will love this CD.
0425129586|5.0|This is Ama, a High school student. I read this book by force. One hting's for sure. I absolutely HATE reading. But once i started reading the chapters on the book i became more interested in it and what could happen next! NOthing i planned happenned. I would highly recommend this book. i read this book in two days!! It was a great book! It is adventure, and a twister the whole way around. From the murder  cases, to the order of the Rhyme reflecting the way each indian died. It was great! Read the book. It's a 5 star!
B00003A9QI|5.0|I don't know what to say. This soundtrack is simply beautiful, touching and extraordinarily expressive. I'm sure Rachel Portman is one of the best hollywood composer's. If you like soft music, you'll like it. This music is now soft now vehement, playng by piano and orchestra. This soundtrack had an oscar nomination, had ONLY an oscar nomination, because It must win an oscar!<br />P.S. Excuse for my english:I'm Italian
B00005M989|1.0|simple. Prince gets no money from this album. If U respect the artist behind these tracks, don't buy the album. Better 2 go rip the tracks from some Napster clone than line the pockets of Warner executives. If U're a fan, U'll own the tracks already. If not, then go check out the NPG Music Club, and catch up with the here and now.
0316776963|4.0|It's been awhile since a book made me laugh out loud, and I try to read funny books often.  This book definitely accomplished that and much more. I enjoyed how the book was written in episodes as opposed to a continuous storyline.  Unlike many other books like that, it was easy to follow and fun to read.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for laughter with a heart.  I have just picked up &quot;Naked&quot; by Sedaris and am looking forward to another fufilling experience.
0446605409|5.0|John Corey is the quintessential, New York City detective.  I have known a few and DeMille captures their style perfectly.  I enjoy his interactions with people and his attitude.  As a fisherman, I am familiar with the area (Plum Island) therefore I can attest to the exacting detail of the NorthFork region of Long Island in which this novel is set. Because I enjoyed this book so much I am now reading DeMille's &quot;The Lions Game&quot; in which Detective Corey is also the main character, and have ordered &quot;Up Country&quot; DeMille's latest.
B0000011N5|5.0|&quot;Widow with Shawl&quot; and &quot;The Tinker and the Crab&quot; are my favorites.  No!! the entire album is my favorite, especially the 2nd record.  I think Donovan hit a new level with that 2nd record.  What is confusing, is that I never hear these songs on the radio, in pre-schools, grade schools, or moms singing some of the songs to there children at bed time.  I think I know why! it's because burried treasure is hard to find.  If you are a long term beach walker (like myself), this album will have a revealing effect.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen! Combine action, with romance, some comedy, and true fantisy and you have a movie that the whole family can enjoy. This movie/story is what I like to call the 1988-1998 Harry Potter! This movie is full of excitment, fun, and laughter and I have loved it since the first time i saw it when i was 5. I still enjoy it today and having it on DVD just makes it even better! This is certainly in my top ten movie choice and if you haven't seen it yet you are missing out!!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I just read a review which said this recording sounded &quot;like it was recorded in a bathroom&quot;.  Well, my copy certainly does not and all my freinds agree that the remastering on this is supberb. Some of these songs are like the first time you've heard them in this glorious remastering.  This person either got a defective copy or something is wrong with his playback system.  A number of my freinds have gone out and purchased this recording after hearing it on my system (admittedly an upscale affair) and been delighted with it.  Apparently fans in the 34 countries where it has achieved number 1 status agree with them, too.
B00005MAM2|4.0|Good movie. We've watched it together with my 8.5-year old son twice already. This is, perhaps, the first Anime thing which is suitable for kids and still enjoyable for their geeky parents. We especially liked the scene where Tetsuo smeared two guards and the nurse all over the walls and ceiling. Exploding scrotum sack of Tetsuo in the finale was also very impressive. My wife went to watch CastAway in 15 minutest, of course.<br />Image and sound quality is very good. Mix of japanese folk music and techno is really enjoyable. Explosions, gunfire and revving motors get you to the very entrails. Cannot complain about the dubbing because I've never seen first american edition.<br />Pity I haven't seen akira when I was 15 myself...
B000050IMH|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and I loved it. And since I want to see the second one I rented this one to see it again. and it is still as good as I remember it to be, and I still rememberd half the movie. I say this is a must see movie.
0451160916|5.0|I'm not easy to scare, and this book didn't really scare me. It's the scariest book I've ever read and I really liked it. A horror book doesn't have to scare me out of my wits for me to thoroughly enjoy it. If you like Stephen King and/or supernatural horror, get this book.
B000006YYW|5.0|If you love Robin, as do I, comments such as these are inconsequential.  You will own this CD simply because it's Robin.   In my unbiased opinion, every single track is a masterpiece of a creative genius.  They should have ALL been hits, i.e. an absolute must-have for any  Robin fan.
B00003CXE7|2.0|A movie with stunning visuals and great action scenes. Does that really warrant all of the wet pants everyone seemed to have after watching this movie? By such a standard, 'Men In Black' could at least have scored a Best Supporting Actor. &quot;Epic&quot; it is not. The tendentious movie reviewers of this country are all about as laughable as Columbia Pictures' &quot;David Manning.&quot;<br />Apart from the great effects and visuals, and well-planned arena scenes, the laughable factor is greatly increased by how seriously the movie takes itself to be. The most boring, two-dimensional dialogue keeps happening over and over. Whiny-pants Russell Crowe's monotonally incessant, &quot;I don't want to be a slave anymore,&quot; spiel is constantly shoved down our throats in lieu of any content; it is certainly no &quot;CINQUE MAKE FREE!&quot; Crowe's glottal delivery is strangely reminiscent of the manic-depressive Marvin the Paranoid Android from the 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.' <br />The interaction between Crowe and the princess is so hammy one's fast-forward finger just begins to itch out of embarrassment. The loopy emperor-guy is so evil, and so pale you're thrilled when his purple-clad guard comes stomping in so that there is something interesting to watch. The incest line is supposed to be creepy, but all it does is help convince everyone that THIS CREEPY MO' IS GOING DOWN BLOODY-STYLE. If you want to see an exquisitely acted bad-guy, watch John Huston in 'Chinatown;' your skin will crawl.<br />As is this review, the movie went on for far too long for the completely tragic, touching, and poignant (blandly inevitable) ending it produced. I'll let you in on a secret: Rome still bit the dust. The Germanic tribes that got housed in the first scenes ... they won in the end.
0688107826|5.0|Forget all those new prime time crime shows, this collection is much more entertaining. The fun of this book is really in trying to solve the mystery before Holmes comes up and tells the whole thing, which he always does at the end. This book will make you think and may teach you to perceive more of what you see.

1572522089|5.0|I watched the VHS version (in widescreen), and was impressed by the quality. I appreciate the comments about the DVD version, because it would have been one of my first purchases in building a DVD library.<br />As for the film itself. Although the 'Lear' story presents no suprises, I was in constant amazement through the course of this film. Although it was definitely Lear, the infusion of feudal Japanese values was powerful. The sets, the use of costumes, the battle scenes, the cinematography are all absolutely amazing. The music is also a step up from that employed in 'Yojimbo' and 'The Seven Samurai.' The orchestral dirge in the background during the attack on Hidetora's tower amplifies that imagery.<br />This is simply the finest staging of samurai battle I have ever seen in a movie. The castle's were superb. Mieko Harada as vampire-like Lady Kaede was an absolutely brilliant and chilling performance. Her cunning manipulations and stylistic, Kabuki movement is intense; especially in the scene where she overpowers Jiro.
0679423001|5.0|Charler Ryder, a rather sarcastic non-beleiver, reminisces about his experiences at Brideshead Mansion and its owners the Flyte's.<br />Ryder first meets the family through his friendship with Sebastian a rather foppish character whose life is spiralling wildly out of control. A homosexual liason between Charles and Sebastian is presumed and Charles eventually recognizes that Sebastian is beyond help and he begins his own career. Charles marries and for all intent and purpose Sebastian's character fades away.<br />While travelling back to England from America, Charles encounters Julia, Sebastian's sister. Julia and Charles begin a love affair that is doomed by Charles' failure to accept Julia's reembrace of the Catholic church.<br />The decline of the aristocratic family is seen in the lifes and deaths of the family members and the Brideshead mansion itself.
B00005JY1B|1.0|What an astonishingly terrible movie! Not only do they have Keanu [the \\"uhhhhhhhhhhh\\"] Reeves wandering around, furrowed brow and all, but they actually let him sing. I guess it was supposed to be touching, but when you have spent an entire movie cringing (after shelling out money for tickets), all you can think about is getting away as quickly as possible, in whatever manner necessary.<br />This ...movie is a remake for saps and unlucky people like me who get hoodwinked into watching this mess. Its deeply heartfelt performances and obligatory cliches are stuffed down your throat at every chance you think you'll be able to catch your breath. A committee must have researched every cheezy hook to shove in this evil monster of a film. We have playing with dogs on a beach, kite flying, stereotyped transvestite who is so darn witty, sad kid who needs a role model, debilitating illness, rain pouring down while proclaiming love in the middle of the street. The craziness of it all.<br />On top of all this you have the absolutely abysmal Keanu Reeves. ...

6305807043|5.0|This madcap journey through definitions of self celebrates, in the best possible way, everything the postmodernists have been babbling about. Layers of images lace into nests to rival the most greedy crow's, stealing unabashedly from the best in new digital effects (Malkovich malkovich malkovich?) and the worst in sci-fi gimmickiness (head swaps are not a new idea), not to mention an uproarious two-minute sequence from the perspective of a depressed chimpanzee. But from those nests hatch all kinds of unsettling questions.<br />Manipulation is a key to this film, as both Craig Schwartz, an emotionally needy puppeteer forced to get a day job as a file clerk, and his wife Lottie (Diaz) compete for the affections of Craig's saucy, self-centered new coworker Maxine (Keener), sometimes while inhabiting the body of John Malkovich.  Who's manipulating whom?  Craig's boss, Dr. Lester (caricature acting by Orson Bean), while evidently the mastermind behind the  entire philosophy-shattering portal phenomenon, is totally wrapped around the non-consonant-sensitive ear of his secretary. And Maxine, arguably the most grasping but in the end the most altered human in the film, conceives (pun not intended) what could be considered a crime against selfhood: the sale of another's experiences and identity ($200 bucks a fifteen-minute pop).  Who is whom, and who is pulling whose strings?  When Craig uses Malkovich's body to puppet puppets, which is the greater realization of Craig's art, his use of JM or his mastery of expression through wood-segment bodies?  (JM soi-meme plays a peculiar version of himself during those scenes when he isn't playing Cusack-playing-Craig.)  What reason, what morality, what intimacy can exist when people can commit theft of volition and adultery by proxy? Which selves really self-actualize (besides the chimp)?<br />Curiouser and curiouser, how different is Malkovich's own art from Craig's puppeteering or Maxine's power grappling?  All the characters are shown in their own worst lights, revealed as manipulative and selfish, capable of extraordinary cruelties despite their individual starts from almost cartoonish ordinariness.<br />Deliciously impossible, complex, and darkly witty a la Gilliam and Lynch, this film is studded with stellar performances by principals Cusack, Diaz, Keener, and Malkovich and is directed by the unexpectedly keen Spike Jonze.  Jonze, to his credit, has engineered a visual world and character moments that underline the story rather than gilding it, as Hollywood generally prefers.  Almost X-Filesish atmospheres surround the depressed Craig while earth tones broadcast volumes about Lottie's real desires.  Subdued, like Malkovich's loden towels - but all the better to contrast the vivid reds and whites that signal power in this film.  The speed and dynamics, too, vary from the terribly honest dragging of a dinner night to two brainwrenching chase scenes through Malkovich's own levels of consciousness.<br />Like much made in the postmodern image, this film plays with dualities (compare dinner with Maxine and dinner with Dr. Lester; compare the women's starting and finishing motivations; compare Craig's dark surroundings and Emily's swin through the shifting lights), and then undermines dichotomies (man/woman; heterosexual/homosexual; self/other; will/action).  It flirts with left-of-center humor and demands viewer attention.  Like haute-cuisine, this kind of film is an acquired taste, and can be watched again and again for many &quot;flavors&quot; of imagery, style and idea.  For those who liked Gilliam's .Brazil., the novels of Flann O'Brien or Jeanette Winterson, or Derrida's .The Post Card., this is definitely a winner.  For those who thought .Fargo. was too art-school to be viewable, those who dislike dark humor or films with grotestque overtones, those who are going to see Cameron Diaz (unrecognizably frizzy), or those who find non-heterosexual intimate relationships unpalatable, this film may not be to taste.<br />So.  Two people who love each other end up together; some despair can be found in two other characters' fates, and some hope can be found in one character's resistance to another's will.  Is it a comedy?  That depends on whose head you've been in when the credits spit you out into your real world.  Have you, as the viewer, been manipulated into thinking this is a good film?  Absolutely.  And can manipulation, deception, and ugliness sometimes reveal beauty and hope anyway, and be funny while they do it?  That, I am told, is art.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I just had to throw in me two cents, seeing as Radiohead is my favorite band. I cannot decide between this, Kid A, and OK Computer which is my favorite Radiohead album, as they are all so good. Like Kid A, much of the record has some kind of electronic element, ranging from the light synth touches in &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; to the tripped out, angry beats of &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot;. Few people can rival the range of emotion in Thom Yorke's voice. Johnny Greenwood is a musical savant, and brings many wonderful elements to the band's sound. Ed O'Brien complements Thom's voice wonderfully when he sings backup, and has respectable guitart abilities as well. Colin can tear stuff up with his bass (the funky bass riff in &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;; the charging bass line of &quot;Dollars &amp; Cents&quot;) and Phil Selway is a virtuoso drummer. This C.D. is slightly more accessible, for its larger number of guitar-based numbers (&quot;You and Whose Army?&quot;, &quot;Wrong&quot;, &quot;Knives Out&quot;) , and because after Kid A we had a better idea of what to expect. Some people have blasted it, but &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is my favorite track of the album. It is a prime example of how well Radiohead is at tossing out conventions and still being able to make an excellent piece of music. Definitely worth buying.
0060392886|5.0|Awesome story of 4 guys hell bent on self destruction. The Dirt really took us die hard fans behind the scenes to explain some of the mishaps that took place.<br />So much is made about how athletes are so young to come across so much money - the same happens in music. You have 4 young guys with lots of money and watch out. All young bands should read this! I may have my kids read the dirt when they are in their late teens because The Dirt takes the glamour off drugs.<br />Well written, and a book that was hard to put down!
0425152251|5.0|This book will make you laugh. This book will make you think. Sophie's World is a philosophy text wrapped in a fictional story. The further you get into the book, the farther down the rabbithole you've travelled. Once you've read it and discovered the surprise ending, you'll have to read it again in a new light.
B000002IU9|4.0|Manowar is one of those bands that has no clue, but they put it well, &quot;Wimps and Posers, leave the hall...&quot;. While I think that half of their intensely loyal fandom comes from the way they hype themselves up in their music, I have to admit they are some very talented individuals. Joey DiMaio is one of the best bass players out there on pure technical skill, though his artistry doesn't quite compare to Geddy Lee or Les Claypool, and Eric Adams has got an unbelievable set of pipes, even if he doesn't quite use them with the skill of a Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate. The songs on this album are fast and hard, though I wouldn't particularly call them &quot;heavy&quot; in the classic sense. They may have a Guiness record for loudest band ever, but their music won't really melt your face like Slayer, Pantera, Fear Factory, etc. That is, of course, unless you're playing them through a 40 ft. Marshall stack, but who really does that anyway except the band themselves? &quot;Achilles&quot; is a long song and it has some great parts but tends to be stale in others. However, I have to say that I really like the rest of the album in a homey sort of way. This music just has a quality to it that makes you feel good, believe it or not. You listen and you think of the days back in high school sitting in a buddy's room listening to albums, or watching Headbanger's Ball on MTV. The band has talent, but not perfect talent. They have attitude, but it's not attitude that makes you think of them as superstars. They are accessible and human, and that definitely comes through in their music, which is probably its most appealing quality. &quot;The Demon's Whip&quot; and &quot;The Power of Thy Sword&quot; are probably my favorites. Overall this is a good album, but despite it's definite appeal it never quite reached in and tugged the heart strings or got me amped like Kings of Metal did. Go buy it, and you'll probably love it or possibly be underwhelmed by it, but either way you shouldn't be disappointed. If you are a fan of Manowar none of this matters. You'll love it regardless because it has that ineffable Manowar spirit that only true fans of the band can understand.
B000002V07|5.0|This is one of those CD's that you can play forever and enjoy it every time. I'm sure I've played this hundreds of times to fall asleep to or just to wind down. It's like someone decided to put lyrics to a rain and thunder CD and it works because it's the same mood. Dreamy, acoustic, soothing. Tracks 1,4,5, and 9 are sweet. Their first and third albums are just as good. I also recommend Hope Sandovals solo album \\"Bavarian fruit bread\\". Very nice.
B000002BYD|5.0|It took me three years to actually take the time, buy, and listen to &quot;Yeild&quot;. And I must say, I wish I had bought long ago. &quot;Yeild&quot; just so happens to be one of my favorite albums. It stands proudly and strong on a pedestool next to Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer&quot; (For my likes anyway). 1,2,3,4! Guitar then drums then all together you get &quot;Brain of J&quot;, an excellent opening to &quot;Yeild&quot;. It's fast, furiously likeable, and all around great rock song. Fade out and you get my favorite track on the album, &quot;FAITHFUL&quot;. The guitar is great and used very well. Among the fabulous songs there are the noteable, &quot;Given to Fly&quot;, &quot;Do the Evolution&quot;, &quot;In Hiding&quot;, and of course &quot;Whishlist&quot;. &quot;Yeild&quot; really came as a surprise to me for the fact that I mean I knew who these guys were and everything, Yeah &quot;Jeremy&quot; and &quot;Evenflow&quot; but after &quot;Ten&quot; I just lost touch with the guys. I didn't hate them but it was a distant relationship that comes together in this wonderful album. I thank you Pearl Jam for giving me another reason to listen to my headphones.
B000002U9Y|2.0|Now I know this was a transitional album from Syd to Dave. But I must say this is the weakest Floyd album I've heard (Neck to neck with THE FINAL CUT). I kinda like &quot;Corp. Clegg&quot; and the title track still sounds great, but the whole thing just doesn't gel. &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; is the weirdest commercial track I've heard by an English-speaking artist.
0783240236|5.0|I may be reading too much into this movie, but it seems to me that there is a really great subtext throughout, which continuously informs the suspense and horror of the film in general.  Even if I'm totally out to lunch, it's a fun concept to keep in mind while watching.<br />It all seems to revolve around the central notion of a Jealous, Irrational and Mysterious Feminine, or Possessive Maternal Principle.  Before laughing, consider these elements: <br />a) Several times throughout the movie, maternal figures quite literally freak out, including the mother in the cafe (&quot;I think you're evil...evil!&quot;) and Jessica Tandy's mother-character, who flips out in the family home between bird attacks.  Though not a mother, Tippi flips out as well, after the upstairs bird barrage.  And then of course there is the biggest mother-character of all, Mother Nature, who flips out in the form of the actual bird attacks.  <br />b) Notice the preponderance of the color GREEN in the movie, a color which we usually associate with jealousy (see Tippi, wearing a green dress, with green eye shadow, speaking into a green telephone...) <br />c) There is a jealousy factor involved in almost all of the adult female relationships here.  The school teacher is jealous towards Tippi.  The mother is jealous of both the school teacher and of Tippi.  All are possessive of the male character.  And notice that precisely when Tippi decides that she will attend the birthday party, consciously disregarding the mother's jealousy, a bird slams into their front door...that's the &quot;Mother&quot; lashing out!  And then Tippi, while at the birthday party, refers to her own strained relationship with HER mother, a character that otherwise plays no part in the movie at all!  <br />d) All the adult female characters have questionable motives and questionable pasts.  What exactly was the schoolteacher's relationship with Rob Taylor's character?  What was her real motive for staying in Bodega Bay even after their breakup?  What exactly went on in Hedrin's character's past, which is never fully revealed, but which we are led to believe is rather wild?  And why is the mother (Jessica Tandy's character) so hostile?  All of these things are only partially explained; they are left, for the most part, mysterious.  Likewise, Mother Nature's mysterious attack in the form of the birds is never explained.  Her motives are only implied.<br />There are some fun, deeper currents running beneath the surface of this terrific thriller, which become more and more obvious with repeated viewings.  To me, that is the hallmark of a truly brilliant movie (and we KNOW that Hitchcock loved to insert double-meanings everywhere he could, in all of his pictures).  Whether Hitchcock truly had ALL of these ideas in mind or not is debatable.  But I'm sure he would have loved this sort of analysis, and would have been flattered.
B000002C1V|3.0|I honestly had never even heard of this album until I read &quot;Saucerful of Secrets&quot; by Nicholas Shaffner. I must say that it is definitely NOT my favorite Floyd album. I mean, Waters is a poet, but the band's strength to me lies in Waters' collaboration with Gilmour. You'll fine none of that on the Final Cut. With the exception of &quot;Gunner's Dream&quot;, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; and &quot;Fletcher Memorial Home&quot;, there's not much musical interest on this album. In the end an album better suited for Roger Waters fans than Pink Floyd fans (But for all the complaining I do, I sure do listen to this album a lot. Hmm...)
B00005BJ2O|3.0|I saw the movie last night and I just fell in love with it. I laughed and cried and clapped and stomped my feet to the delirious mix of music that I heard in this movie. I don't recall ever stomping my feet to ANY movie before. I rushed out of the moviehouse after the movie right to a nearby music shop and grabbed a copy of the soundtrack. I put the CD into my player as soon as I got home, expecting to hear the music I heard in the movie. After all, that's what soundtracks are for, right? Well, I was disappointed. Some of the songs that I truly enjoyed in the movie were not here. <br />Where was the medley that included &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;? Where was &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; sung by Zidler and the Duke? Where was the medley of songs sung by Nicole, Ewan, and John Leguizamo while courting the duke for funding?<br />Those were some of the best moments in the film for me and yet the music that accompanied them are not in the soundtrack. In place of them we get a bunch of songs, while very good in themselves, had little to do with the movie unlike those songs that were not here.<br />Baz, I don't know if you're reading this, I gotta say you're a freaking genius for bringing this movie to life. It's one of the best things I've seen on the screen in my entire life. But I certainly hope you'll release a 2nd sountrack for this movie with the songs not included in this one.
B000002UA0|5.0|Ah, back to the days before the flying pigs, brick walls, laser lights and giant screens. The first Pink Floyd album--recorded just down the corridor from the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper--is a delightful psychedelic trip that's surprisingly toungue-and-cheek. Syd Barrett's Floyd was always more progressive than the many of the San Francisco bands of the time. With such strange ditties as &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, &quot;Pow R Toc H&quot; and &quot;Bike&quot; this album gets better every time you here it. That's what good albums are supposed to do.
B00005M989|5.0|Well, I recently bought \\"The Very Best Of Prince Album\\", and I think it's excellent. Seeing how this is my first Prince album (shameful I know), I think this is good way to start off my collection. It has all my favorites, a least the ones I've heard. I was going to buy the Hits box set, but in my opinion it was way too expensive. Not even Sade's or Micheal Jackson's box sets are $. I'll pick it up when it goes on sale, then I'll work my way down to his albums.

0425180638|2.0|I have just completed the last book of the Kay Scarpetta series and must say that while the quality of the writing waned with each new installment, I was an addicted reader.  I felt almost compulsive about finishing the series even though I felt I should be spending my time with books having fully developed content and accurate detail. Toward the end of the series, these books appeared to be written only to fulfill a requirement for her publishing company.  They were poorly written and poorly put together. It is almost as though she had forgotten to reread what she had written herself before she went on to her next book.  One of the more annoying inconsistencies in the series was the fact that while Lucy seemed to age quickly with each book, Kay stayed somewhere in her mid-forties throughout the series.  It was stated in the first book, &quot;Postmortem&quot;, I believe, that Kay was 40 years old and Lucy was 10.  I found it interesting throughout the series how these ages never seemed quite congruent again.  Lucy jumped quited a bit in age in just the first few books.  She jumped from being a 10 year old to a late teen in just a couple years.  By the last book, &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;, Lucy was 28 and Kay still in her mid-forties when she should've been 58 years old according to the timeline set up in &quot;Postmortem&quot;.  Another error I was annoyed with is the statement in the last book that Anna had never been Kay's therapist.  She had indeed been Kay's therapist in an earlier book but out of professional courtesy never charged Kay for the sessions.  Errors such as these were not detrimental to the story but were aggravating just the same.  Made me feel as though Cornwell didn't invest much time or effort in her novels.  If she didn't, why should I?  Well, I decided to just accept them for what they were....quilty pleasures.  Fluff.  A break from more involved, challenging reading.
B00005B7CK|5.0|My family hyped this movie so much (my dad has seen it four times!) that I was afraid it would drown under my expectations, but that was not the case at all. I am usually cautious about giving anything five stars, but in this case, I wish I could give six or seven. This is a fabulous movie: original (despite the fact that it's a retelling of The Odyssey), thoroughly entertaining, hysterical, and so different from the typical movie fare. The dialogue is excellent and the actors are fantastic. I was dubious about George Clooney's ability to play such a role, but he is perfect. I can't say enough to convey how great I think this film is. What I really want to know is why it didn't win more Academy Awards? It's a travesty.
B00005A1PR|5.0|It's very hard to raise a child now a days.  At six, despite all of my good intentions, my daughter still thinks that she should look and be something she isn't.  Imagine my delight when I first heard Video.  This song tells people to accept and embrace who they are, love themselves!<br />In an era where every other song speaks of fake this and plastic that it is refreshing to hear a song that tells you to love yourself.<br />Then I heard Brown Skin, and I was hooked.  This song is an expression of love for brown skin brothers.  It also reminded me of the times I used to chase my husband down the street when he would leave to go home, wanting just a few more minutes to gaze at him.<br />India.Arie has an awesome album that should be included in every music lover's collection.
B000056IKS|5.0|The whole point of NEU! is apparently missed by some: the reason they became as potentially influential as the Velvets or the Stooges was similar to the after-the-fact effect of Lou and Iggy's oeuvre: they provided a new blueprint for the tired old dinosaur of &quot;rock&quot; music, allowing (once again) for the possibility that the rules *could* and *should* be broken. Their significance is as much philosophical as it is sonic: a song could very well dissolve into sound effects and atmospherics, or could turn the vocal into just another rhythm element rather than making it the central focus of a composition, etc. This, in 1972, was UNHEARD OF, unimaginable, and it opened doors that have remained permanently ajar. It's this type of reaffirmation of the need to occasional rewrite the &quot;process&quot; that makes NEU! as important today as ever, and makes this disc worth every single one of its five stars. Utterly groundbreaking stuff, as significant as WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT, FUNHOUSE, the first Modern Lovers album, or early Wire. Get these discs NOW.
B00003CXQY|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie!  I'd say that it's by far the best Disney animated movie ever!  The characters are completely awesome, the plot is wonderful, the voices are perfect, the songs are good, and the story line in general is the best thing you'll see in an animated movie!  This is exactly my kind of movie.<br />It's perfect for the kids.  This is a clean movie, there's nothing in here that you'd have to skip when you've got the kids over.  It is also very funny.<br />You'll also love all the extras in this Ultimate 2 Disc Edition.  You get to see footage of the voices, interviews with the director and producers (very cool) and all kinds of extra goodies.  Even some deleted scenes.  Overall, this movie ROCKS!!
B000002KAG|4.0|To Deadheads (which I'm NOT) this album is only important as their first but they don't listen to it much. However, fans of 60s punk/garage rock should get a kick out of this CD. In their very early days the Dead could actually ROCK OUT! Especially on &quot;cream puff war&quot; (which Garcia wrote!). The only other Dead album to appeal to non-fans is &quot;Terrapin Station&quot; (1977) but their first LP is a great relic documenting what garage rock gave way to &quot;summer o' luv&quot; psych. Fans of the &quot;Nuggets&quot; and &quot;Pebles&quot; comps should give this CD a try.
B000002UAX|5.0|What separates this band from the rest is the variety of styles that they presented.  This album exemplifies this more than any other; It spans two discs, 30 songs and countless styles.  It's an album of contrasts. From acoustic folk songs to heavy-metal.  From pop to the blues.  From political songs to experimental songs.  From rock and roll to a lullaby, this record has it all.  You would never think that the same band, let alone the same man (Paul) would be singing both &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;...  well, maybe at different periods of his career it would seem possible, but not on the same album!  It also contains, though relatively unknown, what I consider, along with  &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; (Abbey Road) to be the greatest song in rock history: &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun.&quot;  That song is amazing!  The first time I listened to it, I didn't like it, and used to skip it.  However, after reading that Paul and George had been quoted as saying it was their favorite song on the album I gave it a listen.  It too is a song of great variety, with 5 different parts.  They blend so well together.  The finger-picked intro is similar to &quot;Julia&quot;  (a beautiful song about John's mother).  Next it escalates to the guitar solo, one of this coolest sounding things and greatest transitions ever.  The harmonies in the &quot;mother superior&quot; part, with Paul singing an octave above John, are great.  Finally the song concludes with the chorus, &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun... when I hold You...&quot; with John giving one of the greatest rock and roll vocals ever recorded.  The album is worth it just for that song alone, not to mention gems like, &quot;Mother Nature's Son,&quot; &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;, &quot;Sexy Sady&quot;, &quot;Rocky Raccoon,&quot; &quot;I Will&quot; and many others.  &quot;Dear Prudence is one of John's best songs ever and likewise of &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (with Eric Clapton's solo) for George.  Further, this album includes some of the most amazing and varied vocals ever.   You get to hear Lennon, with one of the best pure rock vocals ever sing the blues (Yer Blues).  Finally another underrated song is &quot;Why Don't We Do it in the Road.&quot;  Although short, it was one of John's favorite songs.  It's easy to see why once you hear the amazing vocals by Paul.  If you listen to the anthology version of this song you'll hear the variations Paul is capable of, in the same recording, illustrating his amazing vocal talent.  But you can hear the same thing by listening to &quot;Why Don't We Do it in the Road&quot; and \\"I Will\\" (the following song.)   Once again there are Paul's great vocals on \\"Helter Skelter\\" which contrast with \\"Mother Nature's Son.\\"  Most of the songs were written while the Beatles were in India in the mountains with only acoustic guitars.  This acoustic nature is reflected in many songs through themes of nature, finger picking and folk songs.  The song &quot;... Bungalo Bill&quot; is a political song about poachers killing Elephants in India.  &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; reflects Paul's delight of enjoying the serene natural conditions in India (rather than London) in the mountains: &quot;Find me in my field of grass&quot; &quot;Sit beside a mountain stream.&quot;  This is an amazing album, and everybody should buy it, it is the best album of all time.
6305307261|5.0|In the past there have been endless versions of Bram Stoker's story but i have to say that while this is not the most accurate adaptation (the inferior COUNT DRACULA is the most accurate one) this is the best and the scariest. The story starts with Johnathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) having to head for the Carpathian mountains in order to sell Count Dracula a piece of land property in his town. When he gets to the castle in the mountains he meets Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski) and after a few creepy moments in the movie he sells Dracula the property and while that happens he sees a photo of Harker's fiancee Lucy (Isabelle Adjani and by the way they switched Mina's name to Lucy and vice versa in case you are confused) and he soon sets off for Harker's town. I will not reveal more for those who have not seen it because it will take away much of the mystery in the movie. Let's start with the acting. The entire cast here is great, i can't praise them enough. Klaus Kinski gives one of his best performances as Dracula and he adds dimensions to the character that other actors could not provide. He is sympathetic and repulsive at the same time. Can't remember Lugosi or Lee making me feel that way. The beautiful Isabelle Adjani is hypnotic as Lucy, you cannot take your eyes off her. She makes Lucy a vulnerable yet strong person. So far the only other actress who has come close to Adjani's performance is Winona Ryder in Coppola's version. Bruno Ganz is very good as well and for the first part of the story he stands in for Adjani as the character that we put all our worries on. Herzog's direction is very creepy, atmospheric, and he takes his time telling the story which might irritate some who are used to the loud and fast Stallone and Willis movies. He pays great homage to F.W. Muranu's original version of NOSFERATU and to the German expressionism of the silent era. This movie has very little dialogue. Almost the entire story is told with visuals. But this proves to be more affectingthan if there had been more dialogue. For a fun and entertaining version of DRACULA watch Lugosi's version. For a thoughtful, creepy, and well acted version of the story watch NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE.
6305537798|1.0|Seven things I hated about 10 Things I Hate About You:<br />1. The movie's gimmick is that Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is barred by her hermetic father Walter (Larry Miller in yet another thankless role) from going on a date until Bianca's sister Katarina (Julia Stiles) decides to ever date a man. That seems pretty unlikely, given that Katarina is a male-hating, insult-spouting bundle of neurosis. Somebody involved in the movie thinks this is an original character, but I saw About Last Night... (1986), in which Elizabeth Perkins played the same sort of self- and man-hating hag. We're meant to feel sorry for this kind of character because she's been so hurt that she lashes out at the world in spite. Personally, I feel that this sort of character gets what she deserves.<br />2. The movie thinks it's clever just by doing hip updates of William Shakespeare's comedy The Taming of the Shrew. What a pity that this movie is readily available on video, and episodes of the 1980's TV series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; are not. &quot;Moonlighting&quot; did a killer take on Shrew that had more laughs in the opening credits than are in this entire movie.<br />3. Updating Shakespeare to modern-day high school is a nice concept, but the movie's script never develops the concept any further. Instead, it does a lot of dumb sitcom-like jokes to curry favor with the teenaged viewers most likely to rent this movie. In fact, I'd be amazed to see any high school in America that is run like the one in the movie. The teachers regularly curse out the students and get no reprisals for it. Sure!!<br />4. Allison Janney (later to do far better in TV's &quot;The West Wing&quot;) here plays a horny guidance counselor who spends most of her job-time writing a dirty novel on her laptop.<br />5. The Walter character is a beaut. Two daughters, and he barely lets either of them experience the real world. When one of the girls actually is allowed to go out, Walter insists she wear a &quot;pregnancy suit&quot; to remind herself of the dangers of sex. And that leads to...<br />6. There isn't an event that isn't motivated by anything other than the urge to get a cheap, sitcom-type laugh. The guy (Heath Ledger) who eventually woos and wins Katarina can't just sing a song to Katarina--he persuades the high school band to back him up. Never mind that most high school bands need weeks of practice just to do a simple half-time-show number. And when Katarina wants to divert a teacher's attention in order to get her guy out of trouble, she flashes her breasts at the teacher in front of an entire class. Don't tell me that either Katarina's action or the teacher's reaction wouldn't send the local school board into apoplexy.<br />7. Two women, Karen McCullough Lutz and Kirsten Smith, are credited as the screenwriters for this tripe, proving that females in Hollywood can sell out as easily as males do.<br />One thing I do like about this movie is the climactic scene where Bianca and her boyfriend are challenged by the local macho student, and it looks like the typical &quot;two guys fighting for the girl's honor&quot; scene. Instead, Bianca takes matters into her own hands and decks Mr. Macho. In a movie with a supposedly feminist slant, this is the only scene that smacks of modern-day reality.<br />10 Things I Hate About You is rated PG-13 for adult situations and language.; to remind herself of the dangers of sex.

B0000296SI|5.0|I think the CD &quot;Enema of the State&quot; is awsome. My favorite song is &quot;All the small things&quot; yet, I've listened to it so much it got *kinda* old but Dumpweed And Whats my age again are good too.  I still love the CD and its worth it. -Mark.
B000000JO3|5.0|If you do not own this cd, your cd collection is incomplete.  It is an absolute punk/hardcore classic.  Minor threat is the first, and the greatest of the hardcore bands.  Every song on here is a classic... from the raw energy and anger of \\"Filler\\" to the regretful retrospect of \\"Salad Days\\" and every blitzspeed, two minute hardcore anthem inbetween.  Even if you don't subscribe to the straight edge philosihpy, it's hard not to enjoy the sheer power of songs like \\"Straight Edge\\" and \\"Out of Step\\".  So put down that (...), see if you can round up a few bucks, and BUY THIS (...)CD!
B000001EGE|4.0|Elton John's &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; LP, released in 1972, contains some of lyrical partner Bernie Taupin's most interpersonal and melancholic lyrics to date. As I understand, Elton John was going through some pretty rocky times at the release of this recording. As a result, Taupin's kaleidoscopic lyrics really show. Elton John basically struggled through depression throughout much of his career, which led to experimentation with various drugs later on, including cocaine (which almost killed him in 1990). Elton even had thoughts of suicide early in his career, which is a theme presented in one of the selections here, titled &quot;I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself&quot;. The gay nineties styled music wonderfully offsets the depressed lyrics in this track, as is the case in contrast throughout most of &quot;Honky Chateau&quot;'s selections. Elton was also experiencing some relationship problems during this era. Songs such as &quot;Susie (Dramas)&quot; and &quot;Amy&quot; make light of these relationship dilemmas, but once again, the uplifting musical arrangements featured in these two tracks adds a silver lining to these dark, lyrical clouds. &quot;Mellow&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters&quot; teeter on the brink a bit, although the latter number sort of probes the dog eat dog world in which we live. Quite possibly, Elton transcribed Bernie's lyrics into prayer, as is the case in the semi-optimistic &quot;Salvation&quot;, to help EJ cope with his difficult struggles in dealing with his rise to fame, relationships, insecurities, etc. &quot;Hercules&quot; (Elton's &quot;newly adopted&quot; legal middle name by this time) displays EJ's newfound confidence being restored in the Relationships, Inc. department, as noted in the lyrics, as well as in the uptempo musical cohesiveness provided courtesy of Davey Johnstone's guitar licks and Nigel Olsson's powerful drumming technique, which is the album's saving grace in response to the somewhat down in the mouth lyrics, which have a wonderful appeal all their own. &quot;HC&quot;'s lone bonus track &quot;Slave (Alternate Version)&quot; is too uptempo, although it has a nice Jerry Lee Lewis quality to it, courtesy of EJ's quick piano ramblings. The slower version of this track, also featured here, works better on record, and fits in more comfortably with the rest of the album. &quot;Honky Chateau&quot;'s star tracks, &quot;Rocket Man&quot; and &quot;Honky Cat&quot; are out of the ordinary, good time standards, particularly the latter track. The Mardi Gras atmosphere of &quot;Honky Cat&quot; is superseded by the sci-fi theme prevalent in &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, which gives this track an unparalleled coolness. What makes &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; special as well, is that it is the first in a series of Elton John albums that were recorded at the famed Strawberry Studios, located in France. EJ's next album, &quot;Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player&quot; was also recorded at this same studio, and is the album that pushed Elton into international superstar status. The cold, pessimistic atmosphere of &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; is aesthetically pleasing, and is among EJ's and Taupin's most decoratively cherished works, which are the all-time best in the world of pop music. Folks, it's that simple, you need this CD in your Elton John and/or pop music library today!which have a wonderful appeal all their own. &quot;HC&quot;'s lone bonus track &quot;Slave (Alternate Version)&quot; is too uptempo, although it has a nice Jerry Lee Lewis quality to it, courtesy of EJ's quick piano ramblings.

B00003CXRM|5.0|I saw this movie three times in the theater, and then my kids bought me the DVD and I watched it two more times with them at home.  I also bought the CD, the first country or folk recording I have ever bought in my life, so that I could listen to the music in my car.  <br />Every Coen brothers movie is a marvel, but this one is just a gem.  It's hard to say what is so special about it.  The music -- American folk that has nothing in common with the electric &quot;country&quot; on the radio today -- is certainly unusual, and beautiful, and powerful.  The acting is wonderful.  The Coen brothers seem to get wonderful facial expressions out of everybody (the recording studio, Turturro boiling into anger), and I never realized George Clooney was such a wonderful actor.  The story has the zigzagging, zany quality that we have come to expect from the Coen brothers, laid over the Odyssey, and a sly humor that gets funnier every time you see the movie (&quot;we thought you was a toad!&quot;).  And believe me, you will see this movie more than once.
6305662355|5.0|Bruce Lee in his last and most explosive film before his untimely death is probably the best and most entertaining action movie ever made. Bruce Lee is an under cover agent sent to bust up Hans [shi kien] island. Fighting in a tournament along side Roper [John saxon] and Williams [Jim kelly] Bruce lee must prove that Han is running a drug business. Bruce Lee and John Saxon must get through Han's henchmen [Bob Wall] and [Bolo Yeung]before getting a peice of the master. Explosive action with probably the some of the greatests fight scenes ever filmed. Action/comedy star Jackie Chan plays a stunt double for Bruce and also get's his neck violently cracked in the movie.Sammo Hung get's in a dramatic fight with Bruce at the beginning. Predictable but Awesome!!! starring Bruce Lee, John Saxon, Jim kelly, Shi Kien, Bob wall, Bolo Yeung, Sammo Hung, and Jackie Chan Rated R for Martial arts violence,brief nudity, and some vulgarity
6305511055|5.0|This classic suspense film was released in a chilling time. Viet Nam was a national, benchmark issue; Columnist Jack Anderson believed his life to be in danger from the government and the CIA was said by some to be involved in illegal plots and intrigues. Redford handles his role superbly; Faye Dunaway as well, and Max Von Sydow is most classy as a skilled, hired assasin. It is difficult to bring to mind a film since made that captures the plot and flow of this one. The suspense is gripping - a tribute to the Redford talent. This is the sort of classic one can view periodically and enjoy all over again. History since adds great irony to the film's premise.

0670880728|3.0|Yet more recognition (richly deserved) is accorded to Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by this contemporary British knock-off.  Besides using P&P's plot, \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" is almost a first novel by a woman (actually a second novel) and it also follows Austen's semi-epistolary style by using the form of a diary (vs. e-mail in \\"You've Got Mail\\").<br /><br />The principal change is that the woman in Elizabeth's dramatic role (now named Bridget) has incorporated the behavior (should I say the character?) of Elizabeth's younger sister, Lydia. Bridget-Elizabeth is still the heroine, so it is the mother -- Lydia's grown-up image in P&P -- who takes Lydia's accustomed place in the story's dramatic crisis.<br /><br />Elizabeth's new look could be either a brilliant commentary on -- or an unconscious portrayal of -- our times, I'm not sure which.  Does the novelist mean to imply that, as goes the language, so goes the character?<br /><br />Even though the loss of stature in our heroine is somewhat saddening, Bridget-Elizabeth-Lydia still earns the reader's compassion, as she should according to Jane Austen (per Elizabeth's commentary in P&P on her father's treatment of her mother).  And \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" is very funny.<br /><br />NB: While the novel's reference is to P&P -- a very classy classic, the Bridget Jones film resorts to generic clich's from melodramas and even action movies.  I guess to be commercially viable a movie must essentially be violins and fistfights, with the title it's released under serving to attract ticket buyers but not to influence the content.  Thus, the film fits the novel in Bridget Jones's case about as well as in the \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" fiasco (i.e., not very well).
0307203204|5.0|When I was little, my mom read this to me every night and evenutually I memorized it, so we read the book together. I would reccommend this book to any parent who wants to find an easy-to-read book for their child. Plus- you never get sick of it!! :)

B000003TA4|5.0|This album happened to coincide with a great revelation in my own personal life. I'm just glad it was this album that came out at that time that I had in my possession instead of, say, the soundtrack to Ghostbusters 2. Know what I mean?
B00005ASOC|3.0|Like Scent of a Woman, with Al Pacino, or the ubiquitously mentioned Good Will Hunting, this movie raps on the teacher/father/student/brother motif, and has the goods to get away with it. But only barely. It doesn't impress this viewer as saying anything particularly deep about writing, or in that case about life -- other than to say that one should make good use of her skills. That's saying quite a bit, for sure, but when compared to Good Will Hunting, or Michael Chabon's The Wonder Boys -- films and novels that march across the same ground -- it seems achingly shallow, like it didn't have the guts to take on the murkiness of all sorts of different deeper issues, like race relations. <br />That's not to say that it isn't a better than average film -- it is, and highly enjoyable as well. But if the movie's theme is that humans should push ourselves and our talents to an incredible climax, we should expect more out of Finding Forrester.
B00004YW6I|4.0|The songs on this album are all memorable and meaningful. And my my my, what a voice.
B000000OQF|5.0|In the late 80's when poodle metal bands were all trying to sound like each other, some street rats from LA, released they're first album : Apetite for destruction, none knew at the time, but this album would have a huge impact on the unsuspecting world.  <br />When Welcome to the jungle was played on the radio, we all went out and bought a copy of Appetite ASAP and each and every person who had a mind did the same.  The songs just simply rocked, Axl's vocal range is incredible, while Slash's guitar seems to have a voice of it's own during the Sweet Child'O Mine solo.  What seperates these guys from Warrant and the likes, is not only the huge gap in talent but also the sheer intensity of each song : They all rock!!!! <br />If you love rock music in general, or are a guitar fanatic this album is for you, most metal fans and rock fans alike already own this along millions of other all over the world, so what are you waiting for, buy buy buy.<br />If are curious about any of G'NR's later material download some songs first, Use you Illusions I and II are great, but this one is unbeatable.
0393314804|5.0|Figured I'd write that title so people would know what this book is about because I certainly didn't with a title like Trainspotting!  Firstly, I read a couple of customer comments and noticed a lot of customers complaining about the Scottish 'lingo'.  Personally, I didn't have a problem with the accent being British with Scottish grandparents but even so, my book had a translation list in the back so I'm wondering why people didn't use this as a guide?  Anyway, Irvine Welsh has written a riveting book about heroin addicts and their everyday life. Wow! Talk about a hard-hitting book!  The characters were quite vivid in my mind throughout the book as the narrator, Renton, tells his account of life in a junky existence.  The energy pouring out of each page is riveting!  I was actually bouncing off the walls along with the addicts at some points.  The parts I really found interesting and amazing were the accounts of how they 'scored', how they paid for their drugs and all of the different drugs they would use for a high!  The toilet chapter was vivid too.  This book is intense and is not what I'd recommend for a lot of people I know, but if you like reality books and can manage the Scottish dialect then I'd recommend this book.  Beware; it's graphic in some spots.
B000031XCR|5.0|there is no word that can describe celine dion other than &quot;diva&quot;. every song on this cd has been a hit at one time or another and it's about time celine recognizes what she has done in her career. her best original work is either &quot;to love you more&quot; or &quot;if you asked me to&quot;, and the best new song would be &quot;if walls could talk&quot;....&quot;i want you to need me&quot; is just too slow for me.

B00004YRQA|5.0|The Official 8MB Memory card is the best card of choice for the PS2. Although early Japanese productions of the card had some defects, reliability is far better now. Although other companies have official MagicGate technology memory cards, they are still not as good as the original Sony model. The MagicGate technology is the same as the Memory Sticks sony makes, so that explains the high price.<br />**Frankly, there's a reason you can't save PSOne games on this card: the file format is different. It's like the difference between a CD-Rom and a DVD-Rom. The file structure is too different for PSOne games to save onto. It just doesn't work

0767836286|4.0|i was a fan of Ehren Kruger after i heard he was writing Scream 3. when i heard that i started looking into his earlier work and found Arlington Road. the immediate thing i heard was that the ending was awesome and something not seen in most mainstram movies. Arlington Road is one hell of a movie. it is wonderfully acted and directed and the movie moves along at a quick crisp pace. like i said above the ending is awesome and has to be seen to be appreciated.
B00003CXE6|1.0|Actually, I would like to give this movie a negative star rating. Ridley Scott basically raped the Roman Empire and put a modern socio-political spin on a time when there weren't even free elections. Seeing Maximus throw down his sword and shout, &quot;Are you not entertained?&quot; at spectators of a gladiator fight had me screaming, &quot;Die next time!&quot; Of course, Maximus had to be the adult, white male, accepting of all other colors, creeds, and genders (and he loves those innocent little kids). Good stuff, for today to be sure, but that's what makes this movie fiction and not historical fiction. It's odd that this happy, feel good concept is juxtaposed to a dark, gloomy back drop and morose faces on characters. Scott was clearly trying really hard to say something, maybe even something important, which makes this bad movie all the more embarassing.

0788760440|5.0|I couldn't disagree more with the other reviewer, who says that it was difficult to listen to this because the reader's voice sounds so old.  On the contrary, Ms Phimister does a spectacular job.  I don't think the age of the reader matters (not that she sounded THAT much older than Griet would) as much as the emotions and inflections carried by her voice.  She is a great story-teller, and I was quickly engrossed.  In fact, I did not imagine that anyone would have a problem with her voice until I happened upon that negative review.   If you keep an open mind and have a bit of imagination, you will enjoy this performance as wholeheartedly as I did.
B000002NIW|5.0|The Deftones are the one band that takes a rather dull and now very unoriginal genre of music and makes into something that breathes life into your ears.  The very essance of intensity with songs like Rickets and Lotion.  Which are heavier than anything Limp Bizkit or Drowning Pool ever can be.  But as soon as Chino screams his head off, he croons like an angel.  Especially on Mascara.  Which comes off as my favorite on the album.  It's dark, almost disturbingly dark.  It creates an atmosphere that you will get lost in.  It's a great experience to have.<br />ATF starts off with the single My Own Summer.  A great song on it's own, but the way it flows into Lhabia is breathtaking.  Lhabia has heavy guitar riffs (Steph is the best riff guitarist in the world) and mumbling by Chino, but a very well sung chorus.  The title track is another heavy song.  Good riffs great drumming.  Rickets is short but a definate moshing song. <br />Be Quiet and Drive is my second favorite song off this album, a long mellow song with an epic feel to it.  Lotion sounds like it could've been on Adrenaline with it's heavy vibe and angry lyrics.  Dia The Flue is another mellow peice, my least favortie on the album but still very good.  Headup is basically where Max Cavalera started Soulfly.  But it's a great song too.  More rap-metalish than the rest of the album.  MX is a good song, the girls vocals add a creepiness factor to the song.<br />The hidden song Daemon is awesome but fastforwarding to it is tiresome since its like a 30 minute wait before it.

Sabriel is a good book and I recommend it to everyone.
0783228317|5.0|This movie excels in all areas of film making.  excellent acting on depp and del toro's part, awesome cinematography, an interesting story line, and the stupidity that just makes you laugh.  Its also great to watch multiple times, and you can notice little details you didn't see the last time you watched it, and they tend to make you chuckle.  VERY good movie, I reccomend it to anyone who gets a kick out of drug humor...  or is just obsessed with johnny depp ;D
B000002UJQ|5.0|Great. I didn't used to appreciate this album, it's now played frequently quen I feel like playing Radiohead. It's a neat album with varied song structures. My only problem with it is the length and possibly a weak ending, but out of 5 albums, only two have really impressive endings. The Bends and Amnesiac.<BR>Buy this album, duh!
B00005B36H|5.0|Im sick of early 90's bands coming out with albums that we all buy out of sympathy but never really listen to. Lucky for tool, this is not one of those albums. They somehow managed to put out something that was still as moving as their previous and forever cool albums.
0880796863|4.0|This Set gets one more * than the Rider Deck, because this one comes with a book.  A. E. Waite is well-respected in the study of The Mysteries!<br />This is a truly Wonderful Deck for the Beginner. The Pictures are full of colorful Symbolism (I have taken Tarot classes based-upon studying the Symbolism of these &quot;simple&quot;-looking cards). The images are perfectly acceptable for teaching Children the use of/or stories of The Tarot. In fact, they almost seem to be created with a child-like Happy view of the world, set in fairy-tale history. The Advanced Tarot Reader will not be so impressed with this deck, yet each person must begin somewhere on the Royal Path. Personally, I believe this is a great first stepping-stone on the path of enlightenment. Even thoroughly Indoctrinated Christians will not find too much to worry about in these beautiful cards. This is a great way to start your Mystical Journey!
B00004SCX6|4.0|Okay! This album is not as good as baby, but i still think shes doin alright. To all the people who are saying oh i hate this album and i only got it for fun, grow up! Its obivious that you liked it and her! The best songs are Oops I did it again and Don't go knockin on my door. Shes not very good at the ballads though and i think she should stick to what she knows best! I personally have nothing against the girl and i think you should give this album a try. Who knows, you might even enjoy it...!
0913866156|5.0|I have worked with this deck for many years, and I must say that it gives very accurate results. I do not think it is a great Beginner's Deck (try Rider-Waite for that, or purchase one of the books mentioned below)--however, the woman who created this deck infused a wealth of information into the Artwork.<br />The Major Arcana are quite Beautiful and the Esoteric Symbolism worked into the Deck, throughout, is a Wealth of Knowledge. The placement of two Major Arcana cards are different than most standard decks, but comparable with a set of Egyptian Tarot Cards, from another Mystery school (and, as I have been informed by a reader of my reviews, many decks previous to this era, had the same attributions).<br />As with all things in life, it is best to investigate many different branches of this field of study, but I know that Most of the Tarot Readers I have met use The Thoth Deck more than any other deck in their collection. The Wonderful Artwork and Fascinating Symbolism give the Reader a vast-array of information to draw-from. My Wife is a locally renowned Tarot Reader and she swears by this deck, for accuracy....and, ALL of her friends swear by her Accuracy.<br />The Thoth Deck has some Great Companion Books, such as: \\"The Tarot Handbook : Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols,\\" by Angeles Arrien --and, of course, \\"The Book of Thoth\\" by Aleister Crowley, Frieda Harris (Illustrator).<br />I suggest buying the hand-sized Deck, because Large Decks are usually very cumbersome and it is hard to get a good psychokenetic feel for the cards. It is always best to have a deck that can be easily manipulated in the hands, for better accuracy in readings.<br />Thousands of people believe this is the best deck on the market, and I am one of them.<br />I also highly recommend Lon Duquette's Ceremonial Tarot Deck, to be used in conjunction with The Thoth Deck.
014028009X|1.0|I like the way it was written (as a diary). I couldn't stop laughing. I can't wait to see the movie and read the sequel.
0679746048|4.0|I didn't really think that this book would be a good read. I figured that it would be like many other books about borderline personality disorder--factual, plain, and very uninteresting. However, once I started reading, I seriously couldn't put it down! I loved the way Kaysen described everything, it gives you a glance at the way some people live and think, and at the way they feel. It was definitely worth the read. I recommend this to anyone and everyone.
0345441184|5.0|To the reader who finds MZB's view of Christianity unfair... YOU ARE RIDICULOUS!!  I am a catholic and VERY much enjoyed the lively and spirited women in &quot;The Mists of Avalon,&quot; especially those of the Lake.  This book is to be read and enjoyed for the PERCEPTION it is depicted with.  The blunt and interlaced style of women dealing with both sorcery and faith is remarkable, and how the writer delicately combined history and fantasy is notable too in this book.  A fantastical read, in both senses of the word!!  I would recommend it to anyone!!  ENJOY! :)
6300214826|5.0|This movie is encapsulated in the narrated line, &quot;If that's how Kilgore fought the war, I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz.&quot; Willard hates lies. Kurtz hates lies. However, this is the wrong war to be in if one hates the stench of lies. This theme runs through the movie, but whether this is what Coppola and Milius were trying to get across is left to conjecture.<br />If you liked the narration, written by Michael Herr, read his book &quot;Dispatches.&quot; It reads much the same as Willard sounds in the movie.
0060987464|5.0|Even if you hate reading, even if you hate the man himself, you will love this book.<br />Mr. Manson is extremely intelligent and his book backs that statement.  Incredible detail about the growing up and comming of age of the &quot;All Amercian Anti-Christ.&quot;<br />Read this book and learn how the worm got his wings, be entertained, be disgusted, love the man.
B00000ILBK|1.0|Why don't they allow zero stars? Negative stars?<br /><br />Ok, here's the plot : A few centuries ago , a band of interstellar hippies finds an uninhabited planet. They settle there, and over time, it becomes apparent that the planet possesses healing properties, which make the Baku essentially immortal and ever youthful. Others, inside and outside Starfleet, learn of this, and these people decide to remove the Baku unwittingly to an environment identical to that of &quot;their&quot; planet (the Baku are not native to this planet, remember?) but without the special properties. The planet the Baku are currently on would then be used as a giant hospital for the sick and suffering of the galaxy.<br /><br />So there's the quandary : Should the Baku planet remain a private park for the 500-1000 or so interstellar hippies...or should it be used to cure the wounds and illnesses of uncounted sufferers throughout the universe, who cannot be helped by conventional means?<br /><br />Naturally, Picard decides that the Baku should have the planet &lt;i&gt;alllllll &lt;/i&gt; to themselves, and tough luck to the rest of the galaxy. (So much for,&quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one&quot;) He decides to beam down to the surface to help the Baku ward off the intruders (the more recent intruders, I should say, as the Baku are NOT indigenous to the healing planet.) And equally naturally, when the rest of the crew learns of his plans, they paste dour, determined looks on their faces and beam down too. <br /><br />I really, really hate this film, and I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who suggests this film as a feature for MST3K.<br /><br />Discussing all the plot holes would be pointless, and I think those reading the negative reviews will garner that it's the smug selfrighteousness of the script and the characters which make this film so unbearable. So all just mention what I found the most annoying moment : When Picard's Baku squeeze, asked if she wouldn'tlike to see a bit more of the universe, says,&quot;Where would hyperdrive take us except away from here?&quot; in the most smug , 'nah nah,  I got mine' voice imaginable.<br /><br />I really, really, really hate this film.<br />
0446677450|4.0|I fell in love with the book when I realized that the authors shared my philosophy of overcoming 'stalled' thinking. There is an excellent chapter on stalls related to fears of losing money, behaving differently than others, and so forth that most people have about money. The stallbusting advice is sound. In fact, this is probably the best chapter in the book. Also check out &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life&quot; by Taro Gold.
B00000J7S8|5.0|I wasn't what you would have called an avid jazz fan.  In fact, except for Diana Krall's &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes,&quot; I'd never even listened to jazz music.  But, I just happened to sample a few songs of &quot;Eyes,&quot; and I fell in love with jazz right then and there.  Or, at least, Diana Krall's jazz.  I have to say, being completely honest, that I love every song on the CD.  It's a stunning combination, with her astounding voice and the very accomplished musicians featured on this album.  The best thing about &quot;Eyes&quot; to me was that it was the first CD I've ever listened to that did not give me the urge to press the skip button.  Trust me, if you buy this album, you will not be disappointed.  After all, it didn't receive a Grammy nomination for nothing...
0451524985|1.0|Male readers may find this book interesting (or at least titillating). I doubt it has many female fans.  The female protagonist is completely a male fantasy.  The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part  (Lawrence likes to call this &quot;gentleness&quot;); and that this type of sexual relationship is all a woman should really need of a man.
B000002IRL|4.0|1991 was the year that Metallica went wimpy, but fortunately there were still bands like this doing old-school thrash with plenty of energy and chops. The first five tracks are quite raging and certainly influenced by the genre's former leaders. The sixth, the title track, is a grinding march which is a good change of pace. Then it's back to the speed again until the final song, 'Soulitude', which is a pretty successful attempt at a ballad-style piece. While it's not revolutionary or anything, Overkill's most-praised album is a very pleasing bit of classic-sound metal.
B00000AFDW|5.0|kiss go into a diffrent musical direction and write heavier stuff , songs like psycho circus and dreamin' sound heavier even comparing to creatures of the night songs. in this album ace and peter remind the world of the days that music was not about dumb dancing blonde girls and untalented  boy bands , when music was RoCk N' RoLL so , do a favor to yourself and BUY IT NOW !!

B00000J7SS|5.0|If you are considering purchasing this album and are not familiar with this period of Davis' career, be prepared for a unique listening experience. Note from the other reviews that b-BREW isn't universally loved...but its supporters now considerably outnumber the detractors. Nonetheless, newcomers are taking a chance, just as Davis and his sidemen did when they went into the studio to record b-BREW in 1969. If you do purchase this, allow 3-5 listens for it to sink in...few people really get it on their first exposure.  Whatever you think it will sound like beforehand...it likely wont sound anything like that!<br />There are a number of misconceptions about this album. For one, Miles was not selling out his musical talent (he was expanding his audience via performing at pop venues and modifying his albums cover art; he did everything to make more money EXCEPT sacrificing the integrity of his music). Second, he wasn't tripping on substances (this era was actually the most drug-free, mentally strong, and physically healthy Davis was in his lifetime). Thirdly, Miles didn't retreat from spotlighting his sidemen and himself (there are plenty of distinctive solo improvisations that float above and within the loose ensemble playing). Fourth, this is not a rock or pop or a jazz/rock album (despite the electronic instrumentation, the music maintains a controlled abstraction that is more in line with that era's modern jazz than with most pop groups. Davis' means to this open end included many influences...rock &amp; funk among them).  Fifth, b-BREW was not widely rejected by music buyers (I believe it is Davis 2nd all-time best-selling album behind KIND OF BLUE). <br />Davis was actually in one of the most inspired and productive phases of his entire career, going into the studio often to work on musical concepts that in this case was not that abrupt a shift from his recording projects of the last several years. The bottom line, if Davis wanted to contrive a hit, he'd have been better off going into the studio with Blood Sweat &amp; Tears or Chicago...and had Quincy Jones produce.  Contrary to what some have asserted, this album didn't lead jazz down a blind alley, it just built a new turnpike in and around existing paths.  Its okay not to like it...but if its okay to love it and consider it one of the centurys foremost aesthetic milestones, count me in! I can't imagine wanting any intrinsically-rewarding result from a music project that isn't delivered on this album.

B00003CXRM|5.0|This is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in a long time.  The music is fantastic and the story is enjoyable.  With a minimal amount of language and no nudity or sex, it makes this movie a choice for families to enjoy together.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is one of those rare movies you know that was not made at the right time to be a big hit at the box office. Society tells us we are not suppose to behave let alone enjoy the behavior of Brad Pitt or Edward Norton. The two start a underground fight club which turns into a bizare terrorist group aiming to blow up major credit card and credit reporting agencies. By meeting their mission everyone in sociey would then start all over at zero and we would all be equal - AGAIN! Who wouldn't suport and cheer for that? However, as the plot unfolds you are quick to notice Pitt is only a fantasy person of Norton's thought process. Bizare -yes. Different -thank goodness yes. Recommendation - you have to see this movie. If you ever wanted to be taken on a roller coaster ride of fantasy mixed in with maybe some hidden wishes this is your movie.
B000059QY3|4.0|I must admit that Angela is Violetta. Not only is she very beautiful and delicate in the role, her voice is perfect for the part. She sings every note perfectly. Alfredo and Germont were both pretty horrible. Alfredo was decent until the third act in which he drags down angela's incredible death scene.  Germont looks totally bored the whole time and actually seems quite rude when he is paying attention. What a horrible choice! This DVD is totally worth it even so if only for Angela's amazing violetta. You've got to see her.
0385335482|5.0|Shopaholic is a funny page turner, you will be shocked with some of the antics that goes on in this book.  Rebecca is a compulsive-obessive shopper, she loves to spend money.  As you read this you will say to yourself, \\" I can't believe she said or do this\\". She is in debt up to her ears but she find any and every excuse to keep on buying.  She has a full-time job but she goes and gets a part-time job to help pay her bills. (Not) She justs buys more.  In the end you will be cheering Rebecca on, as she tries to put her life back on track.
6301599233|5.0|This movie has everything! It has drama, excitement, humor, romance, chase scenes; everything a good western movie should have. The plot (based on real life) is this: Butch Cassidy and his Hole in the Wall gang rob trains all over the West. But, when a train full of bounty hunters comes to call, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid find themselves pursued over mountains, meadows, and streams. They meet up with a schoolteacher, Sundance's girlfriend, and head to Bolivia, where they fumble through Spanish while robbing banks, avoiding the law, and getting into a lot of trouble. This all leads up to a climax that leaves you rooting for the nicest outlaws ever to cross the Western fields. This is a good movie for anyone, but especially for history lovers, western fans, and people who love getting caught up in a movie and hoping the characters will make it through.

B000001EMW|5.0|I bought this just a few weeks ago. And it's pretty damn good. My favorite part is the break in Master of Puppets.

078062999X|5.0|Hamlet staged in four acts, set in 18th century Blenheim Palace, and nudity.  What a concept.  This is Kenneth Branagh's vision for the Dane and its is a suptuous one.  Casting himself in the lead is acceptable and he is outstanding although over the top in some scenes like Hamlet's &quot;What is a Man?&quot; speech  at the end of act II.  When Branagh's Hamlet is lied to by Ophelia as her hidden father and the king watch, we can see his subtle face reaction change from love to rage with realization she's betrayed him.   Branagh's performance is sullen and mad with just the right mixture of credible rage.  He is blonde, sleek, and the right age unlike previous productions with older men in the role.<br />Beautiful Kate Winslet as Ophelia gives a heartbreaking performance as the woman driven mad by the mad men who surround her.  Unique to Branagh's film are fast glimpses of the sexual relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia which bring further maturity to their story.  We see Ophelia as the pawn in a doomed chess game that Winslet sets up so when she finally cracks under the deviousness, we feel her pathos. It is a mature and stellar performance.<br />Branagh uses wonderful character actors, American and British to round out his superb cast that includes Sir Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie as Gertrude, the late Jack Lemon in a small role of a guard, Billy Crystal as the humorous gravedigger, Brian Blessed as the elder Hamlet, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams, and so on.  It is a marvelous cast set in the stunning setting of Blenheim Palace.  The wide screen camera work soak up the fabulous furniture and architecture sets that serves as a modern stage for this production. <br />This is the definitive Hamlet for the millenium. Franco Zefferelli's version with Mel Gibson is strong, but Branagh is top dog when it comes to translating the Danish saga.  When I saw the film at its theatrical release, even the teens in the audience settled down to drink up the film and stayed todiscuss its meaning during the intermission.  Not many films can accomplish that task.  This is a magnificent film achievement.  Every film collection needs a copy.
B00000IKSC|5.0|I love this video because when you watch it it like your really there!! If you haven't been to a Backstreet Boys concert I'd suggest you buy it! But you know whats even better!! Actually being at a Backstreet Boys concet!! I went to one in March it was great and I will be going to one again on Oct 20!! well I really think you should buy it. It's really good!! Theres a part where they all sing solo songs it amazing! Nick's was the BEST:)! What is also cool is that if you want to go to a Backstreet Boys cocnert you can just pop the tape in the VCR and you'll feel like your at a Backstreet Boys concert and you know whats the BEST it's that you get front row!!
0380713802|4.0|I picked this book up kind of randomly.  &quot;A Walk in The Woods&quot; always seemed kind of hippy-dippy to me - and while I am quite the liberal chick, I am not so enviro-hippy.  When my dad, a conservative guy, told me he loved it, I thought, &quot;huh&quot;.  Then I picked up Bill Bryson.<br />The gimmick in &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; is a return to Europe. As a young man in the '70s, American Bryson spent 4 months backpacking with an unforgettable loudmouthed &quot;friend&quot; named Katz.  Now, 20 years later, he returns, following virtually the same route.  The result: kind of makes you want to pick up and meander through Europe the way Bryson does. <br />Along the way (through Paris, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria), he sprinkles his essays with historical notations (usually funny, sometimes somber, as with his tribute the amazing people of the Netherlands, the humanitarians of WWII who put life, and the safety of their Jewish population above all else), sometimes hysterically funny observations (about the people, cultures and TV channels in each country) and reflections - comparing Europe now to Europe in 1970. An interesting thing to note is that this book was written in 1990, before much of the conflict in Yugoslavia began on a grand scale.  When I arrived at the chapter entitled &quot;Sarajevo&quot;, I worried for Bryson's safety and wondered about his choice of a war zone for vacation.  Then I checked the copywrite date.  Because of the time it was written - so contemporary, yet milleniums away for the people of Yugoslavia - this book offers a unique perspective on Yugoslavia BEFORE the war ... a world that sadly, doesn't exist, is nicely perserved with Bryson's trademark spot on observation, wit and reflection.<br />Though this book is compulsively readable, there are some flaws. Bryson can be negative at times, complaining that &quot;Europe has changed&quot;, bemoaning globalization and the &quot;Disney-fying&quot; of the Continent.  However, he does not reflect too much on how HE has changed and how his perceptions - that is, his level of comfort, his experiences etc... - have colored how he sees Europe.  This kind of reflection would have been interesting ... we expect everything to stay the same, when nothing can because we never do.<br />Overall, this is a great book to read - especially before (or perhaps even more so, after) a trip to Europe.  Even better, bring it with you to the banks of the Danube and sip a coke or coffee at a Cafe.  You'll be happy to have a friend with you.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Probably Tim Burton's best masterpiece ever since Edward Scissorhands! Great storyline and plot makes this a one hell-of-a-movie. And as for Johnny Depp, he's the show stealer. I would say that this movie has the best of jokes, action and violence thrown into one, given that this movie is rated R. On the other hand, this is a VERY good movie that horror fans should not let go of. Not forgetting Danny Elfman, his score is always, without a doubt, sweeping with emotions. Horror fans, you DON'T wanna miss this! It's a double-whammy blockbuster!
B000002KLG|5.0|I like this one much more than anything else he did. It's a unique meld of smooth jazz with funk and swing...or something like that. The tempo ebbs and flows from fast to slower and back. I never heard another of his albums that is very similar. An early digital recording, but still sounds great and has a big big sound. I use this as a test disc at work sometimes (incredible bass tonality on &quot;Midnight Love Affair&quot;), besides listening at home. Buy it!
B00005LMBK|5.0|I dont own this but Ive listened to it and I think its worth spending money on.  I really like Blur, but I dont know too much about hip-hop, though I like it as well.  Damon has always had a dark-pop theme to his songs (blur songs) now its dark-pop with hip-hop and techno/dance. cool!  SOunds like they had fun making it :)  and the animated band members are pretty neat too. My favorite song is the &quot;clint eastwood&quot; song, the radio hit but the rest are good too!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I do not understand why the Coen brothers' films do not do well in America, in Britain they have a huge following. This film is as funny and well shot as their other films. Come on America wake up to your biggest talent.
B00004TJWE|5.0|A great album from the psychedelic era of the late 60's. Powerful guitar work is mixed with drainy, flowery vocals to produce these gems. Definitely the best album by the Pretty Things. With songs like &quot;Burning Balloon&quot;, &quot;She Says Good Morning&quot; and the title track this album deserves to be rated with Pink Floyd's &quot;Pipers at the Gates of Dawn&quot;.
B00004Z459|5.0|I picked up this cd a few weeks ago, for the single, and didn't think much of the album at first. Then after a few listens, I was hooked. Whoever gives up after 1 or 2 listenings, is not giving this talented band a fair chance.
630157401X|5.0|This is a wonderful action movie to watch. Harrison Ford-sama is Indiana Jones for the third time, in this action-packed epic, and Indy is joined by his father and firends Marcos Brody and Sallah, and the four of them are off to find the Holy Grail, before that nasty Hilter and nazi thugs get their hands on it first! The cast was greatly assmebled, the action sequances were blowouts, and the screenplay was what made this movie the best of the Indiana Jones series-but I must advise you to watch &quot;Raiders of the lost Ark&quot; first, so that you can get a brief intro to Marcos and Sallah. Don't miss one of Harrison Ford's best movies!!! Highly recommened!
0800127862|4.0|In the 1993 adventure film, LAST ACTION HERO, Arnold Schwarzeneggger reteams with director JOHN McTIERNAN (Predator) as Jack Slater, the action hero of the 90's.  Big time movie fan, young Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) receives a magic ticket from his old pal Nick- the projectionist of the films.  After getting a chance to see the new JACK SLATER movie before it opens, Danny is enjoying the action packed-soon to be-blockbuster when the ticket starts glowing.  A stick of dynamite blasts through the screen and BOOM!  Danny is in the movie as Jack's comedic sidekick.  Then, when Danny becomes Slater's new partner, he must track down Tony Vavawldi and his henchman Mr. Benedict.  The adventure is on!<br />MY REVIEW:<br />&quot;This is obviously an underated SCHWARZENEGGER adventure flick!  It was sweet!  The action, the explosions, the humor, the one liners- all good.  Of course this isn't ARNOLD's best movie, but it does pretty well!  It may unbelievable, but what ARNOLD movie isn't?  Think- TERMINATOR 1 &amp; 2, PREDATOR, THE RUNNING MAN, END OF DAYS, THE SIXTH DAY, JUNIOR, TOTAL RECALL, TWINS- all unbelievable ARNOLD films- but still entertaining!<br />ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER and AUSTIN O'BRIEN make the best team!

B00004STPT|2.0|While this disc may be good sound wise, it is not the kind of music most people will want to sit do and listen to.  One or two good moments on the disc and the rest of it I wouldn't give a dime for.  As one reviewer wrote, most of it is swill, I agree with that.
B000000993|5.0|They Have a Soul! GODDAMN YOU! Let the rabbits where glasses.  alright, first things first, as big of fans of Tool as you all claim to be, why can't you see the beautiful humour of Disgustipated, granted, i will admit, it does run a li'l long, with the &quot;second&quot; hidden track, but c'mon, man... why are you ragging on Disgustipated, but not The Gaping Lotus Experience from Opiate, or Die Eier von Satan from Ænema? those, too, are hilarious songs... the boys from T00L have a very distorted since of humour, and it's wonderful.  But anyways, back to the point... Undertow.. great album, one weak track, and it would happen to be Bottom, and i love T00Ls, music, but.. it is an intricate part of the album, and i'm not going to knock it, it's just a li'l on the weak side.   this album is a must-own for any fan of prog-rock, or of dark, thought provoking music in and of itself.  'nuff said, adios.  oh yeah, ps. check out Lateralus, it's another beautiful album, just make sure to have your patience and intellect turned on.<br />-Rev. kandiman
0312979479|4.0|Fantastic story.  This is the one that started it all for me -- my love of Agatha Christie.  Since then I've read nearly all her books.  The complaints about Christie's characters being two dimensional and surprise evidence near the end of the story don't seem that obvious here.<br />10 Little Indians
B0000024RZ|5.0|This album represents the most powerful use of music I've ever heard. The songs on this album still move me to tears, even after years of listening. Dylan is inspiring, and his lyrics are gripping. This album represents the very best in folk; Dylan tells stories that are simple, honest, and profound.
B00003CXMG|5.0|You are in safe hands while watching this movie. Director Cameron Crowe has created a masterpiece of a movie with his delicate direction - he never misses a moment while telling this semi-autobiographical tale of his days spent writing for \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine.<br />It is a tremendous injustice that this film was not nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award because it should have won the statue for Best Picture of the Year. In my opinion, it is the best film of this past year, and I do not understand how you can see this movie and not think this. Director Crowe should have also been nominated along with the score and several of the supporting performances.<br />If you have not seen this movie, I suggest you see it. I do not think that ANYONE could not connect with the characters, the script, the story, and the emotions. These people are so real and caring that the story can only be seen through a warm perspective - you will smile throughout the entire two hours.<br />Kate Hudson's performance of the \\"band aid\\" Penny Lane is a near flawless performance. She inhabitats this character's thoughts and actions -- her laugh will make you laugh, her smile will make you smile. She should have the won the statue for Best Supporting Actress (although Marcia Gay Harden was a good selection too). And the others like Frances Mc Dormand and Patrick Fugit also allow this movie to never miss a beat. The other members of the supporting cast are also good, and everyone is worthy of some recognition.<br />The soundtrack also perfectly matches the feelings.<br />I cannot say enough about this movie; I honestly think that there will be a place in everyone's heart for this story - it is so warm and inviting and real. When you are finished viewing this film, you will have wanted to know these characters - they will keep you smiling for days.<br />If you are any type of movie fan, you need to love this movie and DVD version of the film. The extra features allow fans to really understand the making of the film; the extra scenes allow viewers to understand more about the characters too. What you once thought about the characters still remains true, but with this version, Crowe digs deeper with each scene. (The version with Crowe and his  mother talking over the film is fun to watch and listen - their commentary is very amusing.)<br />If you are any type of human with a true heart, you need to love this movie. My recommendation is for everyone because no one should miss this treat; go rent this movie.<br />Actually, go buy this movie because you will want to watch it over and over and over again.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this cd!  They are not typical rock-rap, but rather, they are much more melodic than limp bizkit, and they don't talk about the same kind of stuff.  Their music has meaning and has more staying power than limp and papa roach.  They are more like korn, but still have better melodies.
0140544518|5.0|Reporters especially may appreciate the wolf's hysterical complaints about the press. Real sources and subjects often complain. And sometimes unscrupulous reporters do shoot for a hot angle, slanting news sharply away from the facts.<br /><br />Those two bits of information made me laugh out loud every time I read this new-age classic. The author obviously has some inside skinny.<br /><br />Your kids may miss the ironies, as did mine. But they'll like it a lot if you read the wolf's part with a Brooklyn accent. Go for it. You only live once.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappen
B000000XB9|5.0|This CD is well worth your money!  Many favorites, better still because you just can't go wrong with John Fogerty's voice!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Not only a great movie... but a great soundtrack, too!  We rented this movie one night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We went out and bought it the next day.  This one is a keeper!
B00005B36H|2.0|This is the first album of it's type I have ever purchased.  It's an amazing album.  I'm 47 years old and never thought I'd like something like this.  The album is most enjoyable as a whole.  It looses something listening to individual tracks.<br />Something about this album touches the dark side of my soul and it feels good.  It's a perfect mixture of anger, testosterone, melody and power; and it's put together well.  The melodies are carefully constructed and there is just enough harmony to add a gentleness to the composition.  Just like The Verve and Urban Hymes, I will enjoy listening to earlier stuff.
B00005ATZT|4.0|This is a great Action/Adventure movie based on a real life story. This DVD special edition does a great job with the interviews and the special features like the way they made the train wreak and great commentary. Harrsion Ford and Tommy Lee Jones give great performances in this mystery/suspense/thriller. There is also another plus because not only is this a true story it is also a take off from the t.v. series from the &quot;60's&quot; The only problem I can think of with this movie is the ending could use some work because you would like to know what happened to Richard Kimble and all the other lead characters.
B00005ATQD|5.0|It's an interesting story about a young couple's curious thoughts and dreams of extramarital sex, and the dark and complicated feelings of naivety and guilt that follow.<br /><br />The usual Kubrick sharp photography, lots of bright yellows and whites, and strange acting characters (hilarious the way they repeat the dialogue throughout, in a slow non-believing manner, as if to question everything being said). The suspense mounts when the young Doctor (blindly) walks in on an erotic satanic ritual. Curiosity almost kills the cat? ... To say the least. Sometimes crashing a party can be deadly. This is an excellent movie. Both Cruise and Kidman are fantastic under Kubrick's control. He was, no doubt, a genius.<br /><br />I've got only one thing to say to those who didn't like it: I'm sorry, because you just didn't get it.
B00005B4GU|2.0|Aside from Tracks #1, #4, and # 5, which are excellent, this album is unbelievably weak. Since when did 3 songs make a great Radiohead album? I cant understand how everyone is saying this is a good record; its a HUGE disappointment. Other than those 3 songs, this album is so bad I cant believe Radiohead decided to put it out. Whatever happened to SONGS? You know, stuff you put on that you feel...feel...feel. I just cant FEEL garbled vocals without odd fuzzy sounds in the background. To me that is not a song. Eccentricity does not make a good song. I say this as a huge Radiohead fan, and even I cant tolerate the other songs on the CD. If you want to check out the genius of Radiohead, pick up &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot;. If you are looking for a band that has a similar sound to Radiohead (pre-Kid A), check out &quot;Distorted Lullabies&quot; by Ours. The Ours record is phenominal -- true moody guitar rock genius -- my pick for album of the year. I guarantee you wont be disappointed with that record. I only hope Radiohead ditches this sound in their next release and returns to making SONGS.
B00003CWOL|4.0|This movie is hilarious! It took me a few viewings to actually appreciate he movie but I laugh everytime I watch the movie. Jay (Jason Mewes) steals the show and of course Chris Rock is hilarious. The version that I own is not the deluxe super duper packed one but I still think this is a great movie.<br />This is the story of the search for the scion, Bethany (Linda Fiortino) to stop two angels (matt Damon and Ben Affleck) from returning to heaven.  To really aprreciate the movie watch and enjoy.
0790749815|5.0|That's the question the exasperated Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) puts to an Interpol bigwig at the UN before the next shocking turn in Alfred Hitchcock's thrilling &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. A classic case of mistaken identity takes place when Mr. Van Dam's (James Mason's)henchmen pick up Thornhill by mistake, thinking him to be a superspy on their tail. Wonderful dialogue as Thornhill and Van Dam face off in a well-appointed LI mansion, before Thornhill is consigned to a near fatal attempt on his life by chief goon Leonard (an extremely young and thin Martin Landau).<br />There's no way I could possibly record all the twists and turn of this plot--and you wouldn't want me to either--but along the way, Thornhill does meet up with a surprisingly sexy Eva Marie Saint playing Eve Kendall, and he faces danger both in a cornfield and on Mount Rushmore before everything gets sorted out.<br />Cary Grant turns in one of his better late performances, and scampers around pretty well for a man in his 50s--a testament to his acrobat youth, no doubt. James Mason is always a delight to listen to, and Eva Marie Saint turns the voltage on high while being oh so subtle. And if you, like me, have a bit of an absurd sense of humor, do check out that furry chair in Van Dam's Mount Rushmore home--every time it's in a shot, I just burst out laughing!<br />Go &quot;North by Northwest&quot; for your next Hitchcock outing--you won't be disappointed!
B000059TEP|4.0|What's not to love about &quot;Ghost&quot;?  In my opinion one of the greatest love stories of all time.  Patrick Swayze's Sam is killed one night and he is &quot;trapped&quot; between worlds as he tries to figure out who and why.  Whoppie Golgberg steals the show as Otta Mae, the role that she rightly won her Oscar for.  The effects are kind of dated but who cares?<br />A good one to own.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I loved this movie.    Need I say anymore?<br />by  Cocoa Channel, the Chocolate Maven, from ChocolateManiacs.com
0060934913|5.0|Yes Bourdain is a bit crude at times, yes there are editing flaws through out the book, yes some things the man speaks of don't necessarily happen all the time in every restaurant in the world, but one thing that struck me about the book was that the man pulled no punches. I agree that the people who line up to bash this book obviously aren't in Bourdain's target audience. In TV interviews and magazine articles he comes off sounding as if he is doing the huge expose on the nasty, dirty underpinnings of the restaurant industry, but upon reading his book it is clear that this was a book written by a chef for chefs and cooks. My own &quot;apprenticeship&quot; was in a place similar to the seafood shack Mr. Bourdain describes in the opening chapters. Many of the behaviors and habits were true to my experience as well. After last night's service where our thermometer near the broiler pinned at 120 degrees,  I'd like to buy the man a beer for not sugar coating a single thing about this crazy yet lovable business.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This is my absolute favorite show.  If your into womans views about men, sex, relationships, &amp; friendships then this is the show for you.  They are real woman with problems most women can relate to.  Through it all they remember what's most important, which is friends.  They all have qualities that I can (and I'm sure most women) can definately side with.  Whether it's too much sex or not enough, getting pregnant or not being able, (however that comes later), or buying too many shoes, or simply things like when is he going to call, or I shouldn't have had that affair or just your basic relationship problems, they explore it all.  So I give it 5 stars &amp; if I could give more I would.
B00004XOWM|2.0|At a first glance, this album doesn't seem so bad. The first couple of spins are listenable at best, and although none of the tracks seem too terrible, the listener will definitely find there is something missing from the old days of Limp Bizkit. The reasoning that the songs are so \\"enjoyable\\" at first is due to the fact that the former kings of rock-rap as far as the new wave goes have abandoned their hardcore \\"3 Dollar Bill Y'all$\\" sound for savvy, poppish, TRL sounding songs which seem to do nothing more than be chasing a big buck. Once anything on here is examined in any remote detail it's obvious that this album is nothing but a sell-out attempt and should be flushed for the mostpart.<br />Fred Durst's aggressive screaming and somewhat-talented rapping skill about the real problems of everyday life has been replaced by a high-pitched whining about how everyone hates him and about how bad he'll knock out anyone who talks bad about him. The repeated echoes of \\"Limp Bizkit in the house!\\" (take \\"Intro\\" for example) do nothing but try to boost the lead singer's ego and fill up the space that should be used with real, high-quality vocals as used before. While some of the songs still discuss these same subjects that Durst used to be able to help others relate to, the meaning of all his new songs are drowned in hypocrisy at this point. \\"Full Nelson\\" complains of people talking about Fred behind his back, while the ridiculously explicit and unneccessary song \\"Hot Dog\\" is nothing but an attack on Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails behind HIS back. In \\"Take A Look Around\\", Fred asks why the world is so hateful, but then goes back to his own hateful lyrics on how hard he'll hit people/\\"mess them up\\". All this thrown in with ridiculous, childish, and embarassing lyrics such as \\"a skateboard, a spray can for the tagging\\" (Livin' It Up) \\"gonna fly like an eagle to my destiny\\" - (Livin' It Up) and all of \\"Getcha Groove On\\" or \\"Hot Dog\\".<br />All the wasted energy there is only the vocals. The rest of the band has lost either talent or ambition in more ways than one. Wes Borland's once funky style of guitar playing has been replaced with simple, synthesized chords that repeat themselves countless times across the entire album. DJ Lethal has been brought forward on this album, instead of staying in the background with simple scratching on his turntables. Instead he tweeks his mixers and sound effects, making a good number of the songs a weak attempt at rock sounding like it is set to a cheese-techno or hip-hop beat (take \\"Getcha Groove On\\", \\"Livin' it Up\\", and \\"Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle)\\" as the best examples.) All these things are used to chop up as many remixes and singles as possible, dragging in every little bit of cash the band can get. \\"Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)\\" was the first single, and a clue to how ridiculous this album would be, followed by \\"My Generation\\" which isn't as bad, but stereotypical still. The ever annoying scratches and guitar riffs that made up \\"My Way\\" was the final blow to the radio world of rock.<br />The only instrumental talent really left remains with the bassist, Sam Rivers, who would serve himself well to just get out of the band and leave the other hopeless members hanging there.<br />However, in all the nonsense, hopefully there is still some hope left. \\"Boiler\\" and \\"Take A Look Around\\" still show the old Bizkit as they should've been, although \\"Take A Look Around\\" doesn't count due to the fact it was recorded long before this album was fathomed. \\"Hold On\\" is the only other decent track, the reason it is any good being Scott Weiland's presence on the song.<br />If you're looking for Bizkit as they were/should have been, look at their first two records and skip this. ...
B00005JG6Q|5.0|With the hundreds if not thousands of animated works I have had the privilege of viewing over the years, Akira still stands out to me as one of the most unique viewing experiences I have ever had.<br />As I have had the opportunity to own this film in three other incarnations, (Two VHS editions, and one laserdisc editionÉ) this one is radically better than any before it. The difference in quality for picture and sound is immediately apparent on most any modest setup.<br />The NEW English language track that has been dubbed for the film is a MORE ACCURATE translation than the previously recorded dub. Strangely enough, some fans miss the OLD English dub track that was used on PREVIOUS releases despite the fact that it made an already dense plot more difficult to follow. The point seems almost moot, as most people would be best served by the movieÕs original language track, Japanese, which can be found in this DVD.<br />Though much citicism has been levied against the film for it having too condensed a plot from itÕs comic book counterpart, the film is (primarily) all about visual Ôoooohs and ahhhsÕ. (Watch the directorÕs interview, which can be found on the special edition, if you donÕt believe meÉ) In this respect, few could find complaint in being satisfied.<br />The movie is a tense, packed, visual wow.  It will rightly confuse most, ultimately entertain all.
0930289331|4.0|As someone who read most (almost all) of Millers works, the first thing I have to admit about this book (which collects Batman #404-407) is that this is not the best thing he ever wrote, for &quot;the un-trained eye&quot; (His &quot;Daredevil&quot; run and &quot;Dark Knight Returns were better for that purpose for example). Meaning, the things that happen in this book are great for people who've been Batman fans for a longer period of time (and I mean really good. It sheds a new light on what drives the characters), but for people who aren't that 'loyal' to Batman and who are looking for a story that's a great single story, this is not the best example. <br />About the story: It's been 12 years since Bruce Wayne's parents were killed and he left Gotham. Now the time has come for him to return to the mansion were he used to live when he was young. Soon sightings will be reported of a man in a batsuit hunting the night, beating up smalltime criminals. On the same airplane is James Gordon, a man who has accepted a job as a lieutenant on the Gotham police force. He soon learns how corrupt the force is in Gotham and what it takes to make it there. Gordon has to show what kind of man he really is. The current commissioner doesn't care about right or wrong, just if there's any profit in it for him. It's up to Gordon and Batman, without knowing they have the same goal, to 'clean up' the city.<br />Several good things need to be mentioned in my opinion: It's really great to see Batman making errors and screwing up things as that's how it should be with a newbie, to anything. Here he is not portrayed as the Batman who comes to save the day in a heartbeat, but rather as a man who is struggling to become what he is today, by falling and getting up. He's learning from his mistakes. With that it's nice to see that Miller thought of giving him his silver age suit, not the modern one he wears now. That really comes to the good of the 'feel' of the story.  What's also very good is that it's not your typical superhero book, but that the main focus is on James Gordon, who is not only the man Batman comes to report to but also a vital point in his crime-fighting carreer. Without Gordon Batman would have never succeeded for all this time, and that gets some much deserved attention here.  Over the course of the book we see the two men, Gordon and Batman, grow towards each other and starting to understand and accept that they both need each other.     A little minor point I have to make is the art by Mazzucchelli. Don't get me wrong because it's not bad. It tells the story sufficiently, is clear and expresses the mood how it should. Only when compared to his previous work on Daredevil it comes off a little bleak. Next to that my only 'complaint' (for lack of a better word) is that, like I said, it's mainly great for people who've known the character Batman for a longer period of time and now want to see how it all came to what it is today. For people who aren't that up-to-date it's a good story, but not really exceptional (better get &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; or &quot;The Long Halloween&quot; in that case). All-in-all not a bad choice to get.
B000002TLX|3.0|We all know the story: Richard Marx struggled in the early '80's as jingle songwriter, then hit the big time in 1987, scored an incredible number of top 40's hits - including 3 # 1 hits - and then he started to lose his magical appeal to the wider crowd, though his work always presented the fine arrangements and productions that distinguished it from day one. This collection holds all of those great pop rock tunes, from the rock-driven SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER and SATISFIED to the # 1 ballads HOLD ON TO THE NIGHTS and RIGHT HERE WAITING, there is also a nice extra for the fans - a tune that was specifically intended for the pediatric AIDS foundation album project - as well as all of the well known hits that rode the radiowaves back in the late '80s/early '90's (God knows why CHAINS AROUND MY HEART was not included, being Marx's last top 40 hit that did really well, while a couple of tracks from his latest, less-known and less-sold albums made it...); these days Marx has become more of a songwriter again - writing tunes for the likes of Barbra Streisand, N*sync and even Laura Pausini... - but the graspy-voiced performer is still much well and alive... this is a long-due collection you do not want to miss.
6305909326|1.0|I saw this film at the theater, which was a while back, and I distinctly remember falling asleep briefly, waking up, and being distressed to realize it still wasn't over.  Had I been on my own, I would have gone home.<br />The pace is s-l-o-w, and there's precious little suspense to keep up your interest.  You know all along that all the pieces of the dread book will eventually turn up, so all you can really hope for is a big finale ending.  But then you wait, and wait, and WAIT... <br />It's probably not fair to say the ending was a disappointment because, by that point, life as we know it would have had to be annihilated in a cataclysmic technicolor explosion to make it worth all THAT waiting.  I can't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you generally enjoy long, drawn out, brooding films.
0393307050|4.0|If you're a complete landlubber and you wanted to know what a jib or a mizzenmast is - this is the book for you. O'Brien shamelessly lays the naval details on thick in this fictional acount of the English Navy during the Napoleonic War years. At times the jargon and the language are trying, but the payoff is grand. I'm a big fan of historical fiction and rarely do we get the details of life as richly as in this novel. The action and the charachters make it well worth the effort. Also great are the charachters themselves. His Captain Jack is hardly the suave, handsome stereotype of Hollywood, but rather refreshingly - a tall, heavy man, light on social graces who is second to none in his lust for battle and knowledge of seamanship. Maturin is likewise bookish and wise, yet still courageous in his way - though at times his medical practices remain a product of his era. I can't wait to read the next book in this series &quot;Post Captain&quot;.
B00003CXR0|5.0|Excellent!!!! I really enjoyed this movie, and without eating one drop of Chocolate I gained ten pounds.I can't wait to purchase it to add to my collection.
0792844890|5.0|Only buy this movie if you just want to laugh and not have to think at all. John Candy heads up a hillarious cast that pokes fun at everything and everybody.
B000003N89|4.0|Diana Krall seems to combine an extraordinary love and respect for jazz and the jazz tradition with equally extraordinary gifts as to voice and piano.  She seems to enjoy playing with her own talents, while at the same time seeing them in the context of a larger jazz tradition.  Her performance in this way avoids any kind of narcissism or &quot;diva&quot;-ism and become a kind of communal tribute, both in the community of the other musicians who play with her, and in the community of the jazz musicians, men and women, who have gone before her.  An excellent collection of pieces!  I look forward to more.
B00005N5S5|5.0|put a bullet through your head.<br />I own the British (PAL) release of this Special Edition, which contains the same material and cool stuff as the U.S. version, with the solem difference, that it was released in the early spring of this year - so I already have this cool dvd for some time, hehe! I think everone who is deliberating about buying the SPECIAL EDITION of the TERMINATOR will know what it is about. That's why I won't talk about the movie, but about the extras. The menu design (at least that of the British version) is very cool. You get the typical Terminator theme - that thumping, metallic pound which is perfectly protraying the apocalypse which is about to arise - while entering Cyberdine Systems, and suddenly your TV is filled with the endoskeleton of the Terminator, constantly moving, showing its high-tech construction from every angle. From there on you can access two kinds of extra material: still material, like pictures gallerys, scripts and stuff like that (there really is a lot, I own it since March and have only watched the documentaries) AND filmed material: trailers, teasers, international trailers, 3 (at least that is what I think , don't shoot me if there are four) very interesting docs which are generally a mixture of cast'n'crew interviews/behind-the-scenes/who did the director think of that great story - just cool stuff. Then there are the deleted scenes. Damn, they are well-done! I don't have a clue, why the studio cut these scenes, offered in this un-cut, never-before-seen, director's special edition release - they are extrordinary, honest! They give you deep insight in the whole story, you know, doom, devastation, apocalypse, the machines take over control ...<br />This dvd spec edition is great! The movie is great, has ever been, but finally gets the treatment it deserves! If you think, you have seen this movie too often already, THINK AGAIN. I was thinking much the same way, but just could not get around that almost childish cupido to desperately long for something. I surrendered and know what?! I am glad I bought it. The extra features, the whole new quality the DVD gives this picture is worth watching the film again for about ten times in a row!<br />Pre-order it today, so you'll have it as soon as possible.<br />Remember, he's back, but he might not stay long!
B00005M4JS|4.0|The set, costume and location for this movie leave you yearning for a trip to Europe!  The details are a delight to the senses and the characters are warm and believable.  I found the conflict of the plot to end in a &quot;moral of the story&quot; kind of way as Vianne (Binoche) arrives in a pious town as a single mother with a mystical past, looking to set up shop.  Seen as the enemy with her chocolate delights guaranteed to &quot;awaken the passion&quot;, she ultimately teaches the people of the town the true meaning of Christianity.
B00003CXRP|1.0|god, I hate this movie. it is so bad, boring, and uninteresting. just wanted to let you know!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Beyond what you think you might know about the movie (if you haven't seen it) is what you catch the 2nd time you see it.  This is a very good movie that goes beyong the concept brought on by &quot;The Sixth Sense.  With the central concept of &quot;What was you last thought.
B00004WG2F|3.0|Although I like the film, I think this is not a Special Editions. 3 deleted scenes and 2 uninteresting featurettes, heaven, what do these people think that produce these so-called Special Editions? But as I said at the beginning, the movie is very good, although it might be sort of corny at some parts. I especially liked the ending, which is pretty bloody and pretty good filmed as well. <br />The story generally is about three brothers who all fall in love with the same woman. One bro dies, the second goes crazy, the 3rd fails to make her happy and in the end there is a whole deal of revenge business Brad Pitt has to get rid of! Cool. I bought the soundtrack too - it's very good, I like to listen too it from time to time while reading. See for yourself!
0060934719|5.0|Neil Gaiman has captured the flavor of old time storytelling.  He has woven a story which is both impossible to put down, and especially simple to become absorbed in.  The fantastic characters in the novel became dear to me within paragraphs of their introduction, and the saddest aspect of the story was that it had to draw to a close.  If only I could have stayed within the world of Stardust.  I have demanded that many of my friends read Stardust, and all have thanked me for doing so.
B00003CXN4|3.0|the movie is not bad, but it is not particularly interesting either. drug trafficking / war on drugs - the story is so old, it makes your eyes drop while watching the movie. but instead of one boring story, you get a package, featuring different characters with different boring stories (actually, these &quot;different&quot; stories are generally all the same).  why this movie got an oscar makes me only shrug my shoulders. who knows? by the way, who wants this dvd? I coincidentally have one I want to get rid off - only 10 cents, I think you can't charge more for this movie, even if you buy it on dvd. :-) keep smiling!
B000001E7V|4.0|'Overcome' is a really good track. Listen to it and if you like it then buy this album. It is worth it. Dark beats with smooth vocals.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Michael Fletcher already did a great job in reviewing the DVD's special features, the Easter Egg and the other hidden and unhidden features of this cool dvd release. There is no need for me to do the same, so please check out Flechter's review for details on the dvd's extra features and give him a helpful vote for his great review! <br />A lot of people claim, that The Terminator is better than Judgement Day, but I like both of them - there are things that make me favor the 1st and parts because of which I adore the 2nd. <br />The story: Arnold Schwarzenegger finally managed to become to good guy, although he's still a killer-machine. The cyborg has been re-programmed and sent back through time by John Connor, leader of the great rebellion, to protect his teenaged ego from the '90s. The young John Connor's got his own Terminator now: Holy [*]! But of course there is a bad one too, trying to kill Connor, while still young and vulnerable and not the strong John C. of the future. <br />The special effects of this movie are fantastic, there are a lot of explosions, shootings, and Terminator-actions you just can not can enough from! <br />Deleted Scenes: <br />1. John and his mother operate the Terminator in order to turn the switch on which is responsible for the cpu's learing process - so Arnie can get more human-like. They open the T's head and enter the port, where the all-controlling chip is. For John's mother this is a turning point, a possibility to destroy the Terminator (although he is the good one!). Find out for yourself what exactly happens in this scene!<br />2. John teaches the T how to smile. A very funny scene, providing a hilarious expression on Arnold Schwarzenegger's face!<br />3. Alternate Ending: Interesting, but I like the original one better. Check out for yourself!<br />4. There are some more, but the ones listed above are the ones I can remember. Sorry for my bad memory, but these are the best scenes!<br />Other cool stuff:<br />If you stay longenough on the menu from where you can access the trailers and other stuff but don't enter one of the sub-memories, the Terminator's face suddenly appears and tells you to get out. Some other optical &quot;snacks&quot; happen at complete random! Check it out!<br />The trailer for the special edition is superb: Imagine lashing flames, the Terminator-theme (dum-dum-dum-dum-du-du-dum ... like that), then a rough, hard voice, while you see a bleeding T, exploding s*** and stuff like that: &quot;Remember the action, Remem the danger, Remem the emotion ... if you thought, you'd seen it all, LOOK AGAIN ...&quot; You then see quick cuts from the deleted footage -&gt; my favorite trailer!<br />A featurette about the T-3D show you can experience in the Universal Studios. You do get some parts of the show, making you think about a short trip down to Florida ...<br />AND A LOT LOT LOT LOT LOT LOT LOT MORE!<br />The whole menu might be a little bit confusing at the beginning because there is so many of stuff to explore, but you'll get used to it. T2 is the mother of all special editions! Buy the movie along with its prequel!
630471193X|5.0|I saw this in the theater, and it was one of the most fantastic movies. I agree with the reviewer that John Travolta should've gotten an Oscar, but he wasn't even nominated. But that's how it goes with the Oscars...anyway, he is outstanding, and also some great performances by Robert Duvall and Kyra Sedgewick. If you want to see a movie about love, vision, spiritual growth--a movie without violence, this is one to see. It also says something about our society in general, how when people change, or are different, they incite fear. Rather than try to understand, we choose to reject.
B00000ICN5|5.0|In 1983 a power trio named Stevie Ray Vaughan blew us all away with the blues debut Texas Flood. Blues-rock was never any better. Not when the Rolling Stones had their glory years or even when Led Zeppelin released their amazing debut.(Before they turned metal.) This is the essential blues-rock album, and the key to enjoying it is the guitar. Stevie rips through each song with a long solo or addictive riff while howling into the mic to prove he got the blues. The best song would be Texas Flood, a song that would be an amazing opus on stage. The entire album is his most consistent with not a single bad song and blistering instrumentals. (including the soulful Lenny that will leave your heart heavy.) This is blues rock done better than ever. If this doesn't prove to you that Stevie Ray Vaughan is, next to Jimi Hendrix, the greatest guitarist ever nothing will. If you have a thirst for blues rock buy this right NOW!
B00001NFCY|5.0|I got human clay before I got My Own Prison and thought this is some of the best stuff on earth.  I was surprised to hear that My Own Prison's sound and musicality really is more enjoyable.  I think Creed is doing what all bands do after their first album is a hit.  Fall into the pop syndrome.  They are no longer writing from only their emotions.  Their catering to the pop world.  Not to say this is a bad CD, as you see from my rating, I really loved it.  Here's a preview of the songs with ratings from 1-10.<br />Are You Ready?--Its good, with a nice &quot;intro&quot; and finishing with Scott Stapp's quiet cool down before he screams out the last few notes.  rating--7 1/2<br />What If?--Great song, good intro fading in to a set up to the hard rock portion with Scott Stapp singing passionately about the people who have held him down in the past.  Great middle with stapp setting up the climax, repeated &quot;What If's&quot;     rating--10<br />Beautiful--One of the best songs on the CD.  Stapp begins to sing right away which turns into the climax with a hard rock chord from Tremonti and the chorus of &quot;Beautiful is empty, Beautiful is free, Beautiful loves no one, Beautiful stripped me.  Then a change of key to a short little guitar solo and the rest of the song continues.  On the singing parts before the chorus, great drum playing by Scott Philips.  Rating--10<br />Say I-- This is a good song, but it didn't grab me like the others.  Its powerful, but it didn't have the same effect.  Still good, just not one of my favorites.  Rating--6 1/2<br />Wrong Way--Everything great, great bass, great singing, lyrics, guitar.  This song is really fun to listen to, because Scott Stapp really has one of the best voices that I've heard.   Rating--10<br />Faceless Man--Hands down the best song on the CD.  Great lyrics, with a great change of key in the middle to set up the finish.  To attest to its greatness:), the song is 6 minutes long and I never stopped getting into it.  Rating--11(sorry, I had to cheat for this one)<br />Never Die--Really good, a bit incessant guitar part at the beginning.  Some of my favorite lyrics though.  Its about your youth and the way it will never die.  Great middle and end.  That seems to be the strong thing about Creed, the great middle and ends.  Rating--9 1/2<br />With Arms Wide Open--What can I say?  Rating--9 1/2<br />Higher--Ditto.  Rating--10<br />Wash Away Those Years--Really good, again fantastic ending, they never fail to keep you in the music.  A little repetitive at times.  Rating--8 1/2<br />Inside Us All-Really good, they finally let Mark Tremonti jam at the end of the song, and that was great.  That was the one thing that annoyed me about this CD.  No real guitar solos.  Rating--10<br />So, a great CD, you should buy it, but get My Own Prison too. CD Rating--10
B00003CXDG|1.0|This is a ridicously boring movie that pays more attention to action and stunts (and trying to make them dramatic by playing them in slow motion) than to a strong plot. While the first was an exciting spy movie this is meant to be an action thriller that is boring and predictable. Whoever wrote up this movie must have been high at the time, and Tom Cast and the cast deliver a poor performance. Short and simple, MI2 is a huge disappointment. Don't waste your money. Buy the first one if youd don't have it. While this is a one star flop Mission Impossible 1 is a magnificent, well written, well acted classic.
0380788624|4.0|I really enjoyed Cryptonomicon, and give it 4 stars.<br />But I was surprised that the author's research missed something that makes the plot appear a bit uniformed.<br />For the first 600 pages or so I kept expecting Zuse's famous 1941 general purpose digital computer to enter the plot - until the book suggested that in 1945 the hero was the only one who knew how to build such a machine. Then I realized Stephenson was not even aware of Zuse.<br />So for what it's worth, here comes the info: In 1941 it was Konrad Zuse who built the first fully functional, automatic, programmable, general purpose, digital computer. All previous machines (by Pascal, Leibniz, Babbage, Atanasoff, Turing, and Zuse himself) were mere calculators limited to very specific types of operations.<br />Details: Between 1935 and 1938 Zuse completed the Z1, a fully mechanical programmable digital computer (reconstruction in Museum fuer Verkehr und Technik, Berlin). In 1940 he completed the Z2, world's first fully functioning electro-mechanical computer (most of the Z2 functions already worked in 1939). In 1941 he developed Z3, the first machine with program control based on binary digits. This was the first real, fully functional, automatic, programmable, general purpose, digital computer, and therefore his most important breakthrough. The machine was later destroyed in an air raid (reconstruction in Deutsches Museum, Munich).  1945/46 he developed Plankalkuel (plan calculus), presumably the first programming language, a predecessor of the modern algorithmic programming languages, including concepts of logic programming.  In 1949 he founded ZUSE KG at Neukirchen. ZUSE KG at some point had 1000 employees and was bought by Siemens AG in 1956. 1966 - 1995 he finally received uncountable awards and world-wide appreciation as &quot;inventor of the computer&quot; but devoted most of his time to painting. Google will give you 20,000 hits or so on Konrad Zuse.<br />Maybe Stephenson or someone else will find the above useful for his next alternative history novel.
B0000041XX|5.0|Carreras, Pavarotti and Domingo possess amazingly strong voices. Just listen to the magnificent Nessun Dorma on this cd and hear for yourself. After the tv broadcast of the concert, I decided to purchase the cd. These tenors have an extraordinary talent that they are willing to share with the world.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Well, if you have read the book, do not, I repeat, do not go see this movie.  Yes, the actors did a lovely job.  Of course they would.  Anthony Hopkins is in this.  But, the script strays from the original text, which is beautifully written.  And on top of all that, the writer or writers, for I have forgotten who was the final writer, took out key scenes.  Not once does the audience find out why Hannibal eats people; they had him, Hannibal, HIT Clarice.  Never, in a million years, would Hannibal Lector hurt in any way the one thing in the world he truly cared for.  Then, for those with weak stomachs, BABIES, do not see it, for someone gets eaten.  What a surprise in a movie about Hannibal Lector.  Anyway, see the movie so it gets sales, but do not expect to like it much if you have read the book.  Otherwise, enjoy it.
B00005K3OT|3.0|Of all the free spirit liberal rebel vs. hidebound conservative straw dog movies that Hollywood has churned out in the past decade, this is without doubt the most shameless. Director Lasse Hallstrom has fallen a long way from his &quot;My Life as a Dog&quot; triumph and has now been typecast as the guy to call when you need a heart-string tugging period piece. <br />Here the setting and period is an uptight French village in 1959. Vianne Rochon (Juliette Binoche) comes to town to melt their frozen hearts with gourmet chocolates it would have taken a small army to make. She meets a predictable array of allies and enemies before a predictable crisis is raised and resolved.<br />So what's worth sampling here? I liked the chemistry between Binoche and Johnny Depp, who played a gypsy troubadour. I also liked that the villian Reynaud (Alfred Molina) was more than a one-dimensional lout. <br />All in all, the film is sort of like a cartoon for grown-ups.<br />The film I think was hurt more than helped by the oscar nominiation for best picture. It never stood a chance of winning, yet took heat from everyone whose favorite didn't get the nod.
B000002PCS|5.0|This CD is what CD players were made for!  I just love to sit and close my eyes with a cup of chamomile tea and listen to this.  What a relaxing moment!  You can relive the whole wonderful movie in this music.  A definite must have for lovers of great, classical music, or of the movie, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;!
0316777722|5.0|I had listened to a PBS radio interview of David and became interested when the interviewer had David read a couple of excerpts from &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;.  It sounded very funny.  I too know that our everyday lives are the best fodder for humor, but wit, oh wit has to be earned.  So while waiting for my plane to depart recently, I saw the book and decided to give it a read. I nearly missed my plane.  David's humor had me laughing and smiling, to the annoyance of my fellow travelers.  Never before had an author so easily drawn me into his world and entertained me so completely. I hadn't even known of David prior to the interview and reading this book.  Now, I must read all his works and can only hope life continues to FORCE him to write and share his view of this really silly world.
080013558X|1.0|I did seen the 1999 movie of this film and loved it. But this one was really up the wall for me. In fact this is pretty bad. And well, I think, Miss Hannigan and others might have there tops blown off. And this one is like over 2 hours. Which is way to long for Annie. While the 1999 movie was about 90 minutes long. Which I think is the better time for Annie. In fact, Annie and all the girls are orphans. Don't they have a adult, like a aunt or uncle or grandparents to live with if thier parents are dead. In fact about everything is wrong with this movie. I give this one star and you reccomed you to watch the 1999 movie in lieu of this long movie.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is Metallica before they felt the need to become eclectic and more approachable for the mainstream listener- not that I fault anyone for cashing in- I'd love to be rich, too!  &quot;Ride&quot; is a pure metal masterpiece, from the classical guitar intro to the last note.  By the way, doesn't Lars have better things to do than post Artist responses on this site?  It's OK for us to not have a life, not him.
B00004WGBE|4.0|I was totally engrossed from the beginning to the end! The screenplay and direction were perfect. Fitzgerald and Stephens had such chemistry and were the best suited for the parts. However, I believe Graves stole the show as the despicable drunk, Mr Huntingdon. His acting was amazing - he had such eviction and screen presence. Purefoy delivered the part of Mr Lawrence very well for his minimal role which I feel should have been lengthened. The camera angles and music score perfectly established the tone that Bronte expressed in her novel. You must watch this film if you are a Bronte fan.
B000002H33|5.0|If you are a fan of the current music that Metallica is putting out, and can't understand why a good deal of the older metal heads say &quot;they suck now!&quot;, give Master of Puppets a listen. This is intelligent heavy metal at its best.  Guaranteed Dead-Head repellant here!  And if you like this, run right back out and buy Ride the Lightning.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is the best album i have. Every single track is A Beautifal musical composition. I cannot say anything negative about it.  I COULD LISTEN TO IT ALL DAY.
B000005ZGZ|4.0|Fugazi, along with NoMeansNo, are pretty much the only innovative &quot;punk&quot; bands left in the music world today.  Whereas once punk was eclectic &amp; vibrant, it has now become a cartoon, loaded with Bad Religion and Green Day sound-alikes.  Amazingly, Fugazi have completely transformed their sound and still been able to remain interesting.  Gone are the dub-style bass lines, the amped-up funk drumming and the choppy power riffs.  This would be the death knell for most groups, but Fugazi get away with it.  Instead, I now hear a band that injects artiness and experimentation into their rock-out jams, as well as exploring their more ambient, spacious sound.  &quot;Break&quot; is a classic Fugazi album opener, displaying a tightness that only comes with years of playing together.  &quot;Foreman's Dog&quot; starts off with some classic rock riff, but quickly delves into a mid-pace display of tricky guitar lines. It also features the best example of their contrasting dual vocal stylings.  Guy Piccioto has a sinister, minor-key delivery and a lyrical obsession with body parts, while Ian MacKaye delivers anthemic choruses and themes in his sing-songy yelp. Their songs are deceptively simple.  The band aren't the greatest musicians, but have the inventiveness to take their limited abilities and combine all these simple elements into unique compositions filled with time changes and unusual chord progressions. The instrumental &quot;Arpeggiator&quot; sounds like it should be the theme to the Charge of the Light Brigade, it has a familiar feeling to it, like you've heard it before in a classical music piece.  &quot;Recap Modotti&quot; is a laid-back, moody number that could easily be used in a movie somewhere, featuring bassist Joe Lally on lead vox.  The band is light years ahead of any of their contemporaries.  Even their fans have to catch up to the band's constant, gradual style transitions.  &quot;Guilford Fall&quot; utilizes feedback and droning one-note chords,but somehow remains catchy as hell. Granted, songs like &quot;Floating Boy&quot; &amp; &quot;Pink Frosty&quot; go nowhere, but as long as Fugazi keep one-upping themselves, even the lacklustre tunes become bearable.  I'm totally not into their personal politics, but they are to be admired for doing whatever they feel like, fans and foes be damned. It's as if they knew that they'd eventually lose a large chunk of their fan base whether they sold out or not, and decided to at least amuse themselves. They've gone from rhythm-driven crowd-pleasers to more guitar and vocal based aural soundscapes.  The rhythm section is more subdued but still very involved, ocassionally breaking into their well-worn, but still fun, formula (see &quot;Five Corporations&quot;). &quot;End Hits&quot; &amp; &quot;Red Medicine&quot; are worlds apart from their debut ep's &amp; &quot;Repeater&quot;, and the end results of this evolution have been staggering.  It's almost like one great band has split into 2 amazing bands. Fugazi are an awesome group that have been criminally ignored, due to their refusal to affiliate with corporate-driven labels and radio/video stations.  Instead of taking the money and running, they've stuck to their guns and become an important piece of musical history.  Give them a chance. It'll take a few listens, but when they grow on you, they are a pleasant surprise in the copycat music world.
0807261785|5.0|This book is hilarious and keeps you reading.  The fact that the Baudelaire children have nothing good in their lives makes you glad you're not them!  Count Olaf is such an evil, cruel guy who only wants money and power. He tries to trick the Baudelaire orphans into giving him their fortune....I would recommend this book to kids who like funny and intereting books.
B000002LPD|4.0|This one's not bad and it's not great.  In my opinion, &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; (no, I will not use the acronym)is too heavy, too burdened.  Where's the slap-happy fun of the previous cds?  Maybe the boys were getting sick of each other even at this point.  Something sure as hell was wrong.  Anyway, this cd is not a toss-out like the arrogantly titled &quot;Van Halen III&quot;.  Poundcake, This Dream is Over (a Freudian slip?), Right Now and Top of the World are all great songs.  And that's the great thing about cds: you can skip over all that draggy mess and go right to the good stuff.
630521610X|3.0|I had heard a lot about this movie and I am a huge horror fan but never had a chance to see it until now on DVD. Please do not see Scary Movie before seeing this or it will spoil most of the movie since Scary Movie is a parody of this. I thought the movie was very well done and ranks right up there with Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. I actually bought the Scream Collection but have not seen the other two yet. I was appalled to find that this movie was not an anamorphic transfer yet Scream 2 and Scream 3 were. That is my reason for deducting two stars. What were they thinking? Anamorphic for the other two but not the original. Unacceptable! For those not savy with DVD lingo Anamorphic tranfers allow 16:9 HDTVs to play in full mode (no stretching) with minimal (2:35) or no (1:85) horizontal bars. Mr. Craven I am very disappointed you let this happen to one of your classic horror flicks!
0920668364|4.0|People who have criticized the book calling it \\"creepy\\" need to lighten up! This is a children's story book, not a parenting manual.If you take the story for what it means in the metaphorical sense, it's very touching to any mother. The mother cradles her baby all through his life into adulthood, but the cradling is more SYMBOLIC than the author suggesting you haul out your ladder and creep into your grown son's room!! It is saying that no matter what, no matter how you grow I will love you. I think it's a great message. Take it for what it is! You could read it to your child and simply explain that it's a storybook, not to mean that the actions should or would be carried out by mom. As far as Dad, why does there have to be a dad? Why can't we just focus on a mother's love for her child? I loved this book, and it made me cry as I'm 9 months pregnant with a son of my own. I plan to read him this book to illustrate my love for him, but also let him know it's just a story. People really need to lighten up!
0671582364|5.0|ON WRITING is a literary sandwich.  The two slices of bread. one at the beginning and one at the end form an autobiography.  I loved to hear Mr. King tell about how he grew up and how he worked as a school teacher.  I loved to hear about how he loved his wife and how she loved him.  I knew she would love im no matter whether he was able to walk again after his horrible wreck, and I knew he would love being loved by her.  My husband and I listened to this part of the tapes, and we had to shed a few tears because we love each other that way.      Then there's the meat of the sandwich.  In a short time with no wasted words, he shared his pearls  about becoming a great writer.  Some day I too will be a great writer in my own style. One of the people I will thank will be Stephen King.
B000003BEV|1.0|I consider myself a loyal Stones fan - I've been buying their records since I was a young teenager in the '70's.  However, unless you're an obsessive who must own every Rolling Stones album, I would advise against this one.  Most of the tracks are unlistenable, pseudo-pschaedelic nonsense that you will never listen to after the first play.  One song stands out - &quot;she's a rainbow,&quot; but if you're buying this just for that one track, buy Hot Rocks II instead and get a decent hits album for your money.
B000001FN3|5.0|I listen to this new version of Tales of Mystery and Imagination and I should say it was pleasant! But... I notice that the new guitar, synths and the Orsons' narration, maskared some sounds from the original working;  for sure you can heard this new version and enjoy it a lot.  A few years ago, when I started listen to the APP albuns, the vynil colection, I worked with some pick-ups and some eletronic RIAA pre-amplifiers that lead me to get the best performance about noise and quality sound, so I heard all the instruments and I can sure say that someones are maskared in this 87' version.  I'll have to reestart my work with old pick-ups to get back this album entirely, but I'd like that Alan Parsons work with the original mastering to turn into a CD, the original CD.  I agree that the sleve is not the right for this work, but the sound should be the same. Maybe some fans won't agree with me but the ones who listened to the original work may thing like this.  Oh yes, talking about the original version, I have the LP and believe me it's hard to get in these days and very pleasant to listen !
B000007T1M|5.0|I am happy to see the re-birth of heavy rock and metal in the late 90's and today, but as always with a movement like this many unexciting and similar band are born into a money making market. System of a Down however never seizes to surprise. With their Armenian heritage and L.A. base, they combine unique musical styles that will rock you over and over. I have not stopped listening to this CD ever since I bought it. The music goes from sometimes melodic to very hard and aggressive, but never out of control, backed up by very unique vocals and great guitar riffs. To top it all off, during the &quot;Sanitarium&quot; tour performance in L.A. they put pretty much all the other opening bands to shame. A well deserved 5 stars.
0679746048|3.0|I watched the movie before reading the book. I must say that I was going to give the book 2 stars for the beginning of the book and than towards the end I was going to up it to 4 stars-so I thought I would go in-between and give it a 3.<br />It is an easy, fast read. The first part of the book, moreorless, tells what she went through. I understand some people's reviews when they say &quot;huh?&quot; because the way Ms. Kaysen writes is very sporadic, one short chapter it's about this and the next short chapter it's about something completely different. Does that have something to do with her 'disorder'? Or just the way she chooses to write? I don't know.<br />Speaking of the disorder-while watching the movie, as well as reading the books...everyone has 2 voices. So I connected with a lot of what she was saying HOWEVER most people listen and agrees with the &quot;real&quot; voice that lives in the real world. And most people do not bang their wrists, etc. Perhaps she really believes the one that tells her the thing in the corner of the room is a tiger and not a golden bookcase or what have you. You'll understand what she thinks and why, more towards the end of the book, when she really explains why she is the way she is or was and why she was in the hospital for a year and a half.<br />One thing that really irked me about the book. Well, I don't know if I should consider this a book irking, more like the movie. The whole deal with Daisy. Daisy, in the movie, hung herself while Susanna and Lisa were passing by on their way to their destination after hop scotching the hospital. In the book, Daisy is not with Lisa or Susanna when she kills herself.<br />Now I know movies are exaggerated and made more hyped to get people to watch but in my opinion, the whole Daisy thing was a big thing to blow out of proportion-in terms of Lisa and Susanna witnessing such things, when they really didn't.<br />Overall I give it a 3. There are other books out there that really digs deep interms of mental disorders and people's lives. But if you're one to read memoirs, all types of them...I'll recommend the book. The way it's written, however, is not for everyone. So if anything, check it out at the library or borrow it from someone you know that has it on hand, if you're not for certain.
B000002UZ4|5.0|Over the last 10 years, the Pet Shop Boys' American audience seems to have dwindled to a cult gay following.  That's too bad, because, as Discography shows, Pet Shop Boys are one of the finest pop groups around and deserve far more success in the USA.  Discography is a near-flawless retrospective covering their hits from 1985-1991.  And the liner notes include the release date, UK chart position, and comments for each single.  Listening to this disc was a trip through memory lane, from my days in high school right through my college years.  I have always been a fan of PSB since day one and own almost their entire catalogue.  If you're looking to build a collection of great pop music CDs, Discography should be one of your first purchases.  It's highly recommended, and it's required listening.
0679601686|3.0|I was surprised to read that a previous reviewer expected to find P&amp;P &quot;too boring and feminist&quot;. I wish it was either more boring or more feminist. It was so witty and well-written that I couldn't put it down. But I felt uncomfortable with the underlying assumption that a woman's ultimate fulfillment is to marry a rich and gorgeous man. Of course it has very strong female characters, and was a very progressive novel for its time. The fact that it is still so popular makes me wonder how far we have come. I preferred Eliot's Middlemarch - a similar type of novel with a more balanced view of female ambition, morality and emotion.
B00005ATQI|5.0|If you are reading this review to see if it will pursuade you to buy the shining then i know you are going to buy it anyway. i first saw the shining when i was about 13 at this age it scared me senseless but still i found the film throughly enjoyable. then i saw it again later on, quite honestly i was shocked. Although i had seen this film before at 13, i didnt appreciate it. This film is without doubt the best film made. just one word of warning.......get the 1980s version as this is the best all other versions are very poor and do not do the film any justice.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Ravishing is the word that best describes every aspect of Moulin Rouge, from the daring execution of the production to the perfect emotional pitch of the melody of familiar ballads to striking performances, most notably by Nicole Kidman who simply looks ravishing. I didn't want to see this film- the concept seemed hokey, the premise contrived and opportunistic, and the hype of this 'revival' of the musical too commercial.  And the first couple minutes of the movie didn't change this impression- the splashy colors, the loud, vibrant music, the tumble of characters onto the screen, all seemed too overwhelming to be effective.  Yet, its this energetic approach to filmmaking and storytelling- interspersed with the gentleness of the narration- that makes this film brilliant.  What's most amazing is that the songs strung together produce a deeply emotional affect that one is totally unprepared for.  This is literally the kind of film that makes you laugh and cry at the same time.  McGregor excels in this unlikely role- considering the roles that made him a big name- but it's Nicole Kidman who adds the searing heat that makes this a love story more than a splashy period musical. While the success of this movie may lead some to predict a revival in the music, albeit in a very different way from the traditional standard, this is a tricky formula to copy.  Moulin Rouge is a rarity in Hollywood movies, a daring original.  To have avoided this being a disaster, the filmmakers had to align performance, music, and cinematography perfectly. They did.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Alright, here's the deal. If you have any remote intrest in metal, do yourself a favor and order this album. It is straight Hard Metal music. The lyrics are great and the riffs kick a$$. In my opinion, EYELESS is the best track. If you like rock, metal, heavy metal, or Hardcore music , buy this record. Trust me , you will love it. I plan on writing a review for slipknot's upcoming release IOWA so be ready. As always, caution when head-bangin near sharp or pointy objects....LATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000009RC2|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time in any genre. Those who complain that it is too fast or has too many guitar solos miss the point--that's what the music aimed to do, and did so as brilliantly as could be. With regard to those who have said that McLaughlin dominated his bandmates, as soon as he did not, the results were much worse (The Lost Trident Sessions and their subsequent solo careers). This is an intense blast of brilliance, the type of mindblowing inspiration captured on tape that doesn't seem to happen much any more.
B000002ULO|5.0|When I first heard this cd I could not believe it was Paul McCartney 1999. I thought I was listening to McCartney 1969!! The songs on this album are so great and true McCartney/Lennon feel, that I just can't stop listening to it! I have had this cd in my car now for 3 weeks playing everywhere I go and has not left my cd player yet! McCartney really put his soul into this album and many of the songs take you back to what could have been feelings. Almost feels like John Lennon helped him with this album it's so good.  Maybe John did spiritually.  Pauls voice sounds strong and his lyrics are even stronger! Makes me wish that the fab four were still around it's so good. His son plays guitar on track 10 and I am amazed at how closely he resembles his fathers playing!  If you were to purchase any of Pauls solo albums from the last 10 years.  You must and I repeat must purchase this one!  It is a masterpiece!<br />Thank you Paul.  Give us another great album soon!
B00003CXFG|4.0|Okay, just kidding.  But this is a suspenseful movie.  I jumped a few times.<br />A spaceship crash-lands on a planet that used to be colonized.  This ship is transporting a violent criminal.  There is something on the planet that preys on humans.<br />The characters are intriguing.  The atmosphere is charged.  The cinematography is excellent, including the use of colored lenses to create an alien feel to this world.  I can't tell you any more without giving stuff away!  Watch this movie...but watch it with someone close enough to clutch in fear!
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World can be a very rewarding book if enough time and thought is put into it. I found that it was a good introduction to philosophy, and was comprehensible without being patronising. It could almost be used as a philosophy textbook, but it is by no means boring. The book is divided up so that new philosophies are more digestible. The storyline is a clever way of occasionally putting newly learnt philosophies into practice. The only reason Sophie's World did not get five stars was that it sometimes became a little heavy- going. But for those who like a challenge, definately worth your while.
0451191153|5.0|the longest book i have ever read and probably the most profound. i have often wondered if it was a sin to be truly original, to be able to follow my own vision and not give a damn about the masses. our society preaches individuality, but in reality, we don't want people to be &quot; too different &quot; then we chastise them for being freaky. we're not supposed to love our job; it's just something to pay the rent. is the need of one more than the need of many?<br />    ayn rand thinks so. and i'd like to thank her for writing this book. when i started reading it, i didn't read it for it's philosophical merits; i read it because it was  a well known book. but i have to agree with some of the ideas she puts forth here. i think a man is honest, if he lives his life on his own terms. if he does work that is true in his mind and heart, and not simply for the masses. i think you help your fellow man most, by helping yourself first. then you can put yourself in a position.<br />    i could be all day talking about the characters. i will just say that they are dynamic. you won't get bored getting to know them.dominique francon is the most intriguing character in the book.more so than howard roarke. ellsworth toohey is the ultimate heavy....<br />   don't be afraid of the book's length...it goes by quickly... after reading this i feel courageous enough to take on longer stuff...
B000003TAR|5.0|I have all of Nirvana's CDs and, in my oppinion, this is the best.  It has a good mix of song stiles, rangeing from fast songs where Kurt is just screaming his lungs out (tourettes) to slower more impactful songs like Heart Shaped Box or Pennyroyal Tea.  Rape Me, a song of poetic justice, displays there tallent for writing strong lyrics and &quot;catchy&quot; beats.  My favorite song, Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle, will have more of an impact if you know the story of Frances Farmer or better yet, have read her autobiography.  If this is your first Nirvana album, go with Nevermind.  But if not, buy In Utero NOW!

B000051VWW|2.0|I guess I should've known better than to think after 8 years, Sade would not change her sound, but....I found Lover's Rock quite disappointing.  I've gotten used to the tunes after hearing the CD several times, and it is now tolerable.  But comparing it to the unforgettable jazzy and seductive songs like in \\"Promise\\", this one fails to deliver.  I found some of the guitar here to be somewhat \\"choppy\\" and \\"squeaky\\", and it was almost as if I'm hearing folk music instead of smooth jazz.  Although, I'm giving it more than 1 star because her voice is still undeniably excellent and above the rest.  Yet, some artists need to realize that change isn't always good, and trying to \\"update\\" your sound doesn't always mean success.  Sade, it's your old sound that made you an icon in the first place, and is also the reason why fans still yearn for you after all these years...so bring it back!
B000003TAW|2.0|After listening to 2001 one a few times, I now listen to it five times a week, can't live without it. So I buy the blue album, yeah I remember these hits, I remember how much they suck, no wonder they broke up and took six years off, This is alternative rock at it's worst, of course you might like it if you wanna relive the music of the early nineties, Many of the old fans don't like the new Weezer, I know understand, Weezer is no longer alternative just a great straight at ya rock n roll band.
0783227019|2.0|Pacino, as usual, does good work.  His stint as a Puerto Rican is great,though he doesn't have a way with accents.  The opening scene is inspired...good stuff.  Great personality development.  Excellent plot and devices...typical racketeering gangsta flick stuff.  The only thing I really disliked about the movie...but was a big part was the romantic element.  I thought Penelope Ann Miller was a bore.  They could have written out her character and the film would have been all the better for it.  Sean Penn's acting was really good considering I was feeling pure disgust for him during the entire movie.  Of course, I think his makeup and hair had a lot to do with this.  Save your money on this one.  Buy Godfathers or Dog Day Afternoon, or Glengarry Glen Ross or Scarface instead.
B00004RYZT|5.0|After seeing Rammstein live on the Mutter tour, I had to get this DVD.  The 5.1 digital surround sound on this disc just blew me away.  The band is a must see live, I've been to tons of concerts and Rammstein ranks up their up with Pink Floyd and Rush as far as a live performance goes.  Their theatrics and pyros are second to none and their music drives it home.  Rammstein puts on the type of shows where you can actually say, &quot;I've never seen that done before&quot;. Hopefully they will bring out a DVD from the current Mutter Tour.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Excellent work and talent by Stevie Nicks. She is my sister of the moon and spiritual sister of music. I love her always have always will. Debbie Bott
B00004VW0V|4.0|Ok, the Foreigner sessions were a little different from Tillerman and Firecat.  It seems a lot of work went into the making of these songs.  The song writing style is basically the same, but the use of different instruments makes it unusual.  Not the solo guitars and piano mixes we were used to.  Nevertheless, it is a fine album.
6300216543|5.0|The story of Frank Serpico, an honest Nyc cop, is one of the most compelling police movies ever made.  Al Pacino gives the character a lot of class and cool.  Serpico is an easy-going guy with very clear morals about what's right and what's wrong.  As he moves from precinct to precinct in dire hope of finding an honest place to work, all he finds are more and more corrupt cops...and it seems to be driving him insane both morally, and insane because the cops aren't comfortable with cops who don't take money.  The film does a great job of displaying how the corruption is corrosive and unjust to the people of our country...but esp. interesting is that this wonderfully directed Sidney Lumet film is really very much like a suspense adventure chase...but at a much slower speed in which you can watch as things crumble and go to pot.  Pacino plays the role in an understated manner...perhaps due to his knowledge of the real Frank Serpico, or maybe a creative choice.  Either way, it's not his usual boisterous way...no crooked looks, no playful grins, etc.  You'll forget Pacino is in this character.  That Academy is worthless for not handing out an Oscar for this or Scarface or for Godfather I or II...or Dog Day Afternoon or Glengarry Glen Ross.
0440213525|4.0|I'd actually give it 4.5 stars. The Client is, overall, an excellent book.  Although it does drag in places and some of the &quot;lawyer jargon&quot; can get annoying, the characterization and plot are quite extrodinary. It is  a very suspenseful and unpredictble novel which kept me up till 4 am reading.  What makes the book so good is the complex charcters. Mark Sway--an eleven year old, trailor-trash, kid is brilliant and foolish all at the same time which keeps the book moving well because every time he gets himself out of a situation, he always manages to get himself into another.  He talks like hes 45 and will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  He also questions alot about society and the legal system  in such a childlike matter that it really makes you stop and think about your position on the topic and what you would tell an 11 year old kid.  Reggie Love is definitely the most complex character. After a painful divorce, attempted suicide, and commitment into various mental facilities, she begins a new life as a smart-talking, witty, clever, and absolutely crazy lawyer who you just have to love. They call it her &quot;second life&quot; and she lives it to it's fullest.  Only a 4 year lawyer and shes able to outsmart the FBI. She cares so much, too much, about her &quot;little clients&quot; and although she denies it, is willing to risk her life for some of them. Shes a very strong character, but still very vulnerable, which makes for a great story.   Foltrigg (sp?), is the opposing, big-headed, stuck up, U.S. prosecuting attorney who is absolutely determined to win the case no matter the extremes. Completely engrossed in his job, he really helps display the infamous view of the lying, cheating, snake-like lawyers which we all hate so dearly, yet, Grisham also makes it seem like he is just trying to do his job.    The plot, which is outlined in every other review, therefore pointless for me to elaborate :), is eigther full-blown action, or boring, drag along lawyer stuff and mob talk. Basically, at some parts you can't put the book down and then at others you are just waiting in agony for something exciting to happen, but its well worth the wait. Overall--I'd only read it if you have a lot of time becasue you might not be able to put it down. Then rent the movie. Then join a antismoking organization---read the book and youll know why :)
B0000026WD|5.0|I recently went through some old stuff from my childhood, and amongst other things I found a Michael Jackson poster,and some tapes(Dangerous, Thriller, off the Wall) and I rememmbered how big a fan I was! I put Dangerous in the tape player and suddenly I was back in 1991-92.. <br />Disregard what others say, this is such a great album, not only the music, but the way it makes you feel. All the song are great, but Black and White, Heal the World, In the Closet, and Rememmber the Time are really excellent!<br />No matter how hard certain people try to diss Michael, it's impossible not to respect this madly talented artist! <br />The Michael haters, are the young teeny boppers, who are to young to rememmber the time when Michael rocked the world!!<br />Two words 'buy it'!!
B00004Z459|4.0|This is a good cd. I guess you could say a great debut. The strong points in it are the insightful lyrics and how all of us teenagers can probably relate to them. Weakpoints are to much rap (some ppl might find that a strong point, but for myself being the rap hater that i am, its a weakness on the cd). Plus if they want to consider themselves are hard core band, they need to get heavier and have more guitar riffs and heavier bass lines. All in all this is a pretty good cd.
B00002MHRW|4.0|This cd is a combination of the U.K. release (mono) and the U.S. (stereo) release of Mr. Fantasy. Very psychedelic in the likes of Sgt. Pepper etc. but also has some jazz funk moments as in track 10 'Giving to you&quot;.If you like Steve Winwood you will get a huge kick out of this album as it was cut prior to his joining up to form the Spencer Davis Group. A worthwhile purchase.
B00005B36H|5.0|An important axiom of wisdom is the ability to recognise beauty even when it is not pretty. This is necessary when listening to Tool, since no pop-sensibilities are to be found on 'Lateralus'. <br />But just as much as there is a market for short,catchy songs, so is there one for massive, self-indulgent ones. The novelty of either format wears off eventually, and what remains is a forgettable nothing or a gleaming gem, and for the first time I feel that a Tool song has become the former - but only mildly so.<br />Lateralus suffers from repitition - 5 minutes of a complex riff and meausre doesn't equal to a complex song - but personally I feel this was intended. It may be labelled under 'Math-rock' but this was never going to be a prog-rock album. It's meant to be hypnotic in the stoner-rock (thus Kyuss influenced) sense of the word. Tool, by their own omission, are not in-fallible musicians, not technically in the vein as those in Dream Theater, Flowerkings or Spock's Beard - but this only means the music will be driven by emotion first, and makes for a right-lobed feast.<br />As Opiate was mis-labled as metal, so is Lateralus looked upon as something of a saviour - and this is a pity. It's just music, close your eyes, relax and take it in. When looked upon in this light, it succeeds over and over, and Tool will do it again and again in their devoid-of-rhetoric way...
0451527712|2.0|         I ask if Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is really all its cracked up to be. For generations, this book has been rated as one of the greatest horror stories of all time. I can understand at the time this was written it horrified many people, but did it really stand the test of time?<br />          My main problem with the book was the lack of information. So many things were left out, especially the details on how The Creature was actually created. The general writing style that Mary Shelley used when writing this book is very weak, and isnt supported enough by actual fact to make it beleivable. It seems that on many occasions, she avoids getting into details about things she knows nothing about, and just assumes the reader will accept this. I needed more than just excuses to keep me wanting to read on.<br />          This isnt my only complaint, we reach other voids as well. When The Creature is drifting around for months on end, he suspicously, and coincidentally, finds cloaths, food, and fire out of nowhere. These coincidences not only distract, but confuse the reader at times. It sometimes provokes the idea that maybe Mary Shelley herself doesnt know what to do, which ultimatelly supports my argument on her weak writing style.<br />          I was gravely dissapointed in this book after I finished it, and was left wanting much, much more out of it. It could have been much better. It could have been a satire on human life, or given a much deeper question on what is it to be human, or to be God, or what it means to be given life, or a soul. These were the questions I was asking throughout my read, and these are the questions that were never answered sufficiently enough.<br />          I read this book to get a taste of the classics, and what a good horror story might be like...if you want to read a horror classic, read The Exorcist, or Bram Stoker's Dracula...I always liked Lagosi more than Karloff anyways.
B00005JG6Q|4.0|I don't understand some of the Akira purists who hate this DVD release.  It is *spectacular*.  I've never seen it before so this &quot;polluted&quot; DVD release is my first.  I was practically pushed into seeing it (I'm not really an anime fan except for Gundam Wing).  Anyhow, man was I impressed.  This thing was done before computers were used to make the process easier.  With that in mind you can tell it's a labor of love.  Like with most anime I've seen the plot can get confusing sometimes.  Stick with it -- watch it again.  It's really quite cerebral and fun, but not for kids.  And don't listen to these nay-sayers.  Enjoy it for what it IS, not what it WAS.
B000002J1O|5.0|This was the first Genesis album that I owned, and I have to admit that on first hearing, I thought I'd never get into it. But wow! After hearing it a couple or 3 times, it just blew me away. And still, after probably hundreds of listenings, there always seems to be new things to discover in it. The songs have a real mystical, fantasy feel to them...sometimes the lyrics make no sense, but it doesn't matter. It all adds to the magic. And the music...sheer brilliance. Get this album...it's a must-have for any music lover.
B00005B364|5.0|One of the classic releases of progressive rock.  Hocus Pocus, a spoof, became a hit.  A nice variety of short songs and the expanded composition.  Jan's fingers fly at speeds beyond belief.  A must for collector's of the era.
B000002J2D|4.0|I am a fan of Genesis, period. Whether it be their earlier stuff with Gabriel or their later albums with Collins as frontman. While I do really like this album, I don't think it's one of their best, although I do think it deserves 4 stars at least. The songs are not as &quot;prog rock&quot; as previous albums, although a couple of songs still have the &quot;epic&quot; touch. &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; was a big hit for Genesis, and was the sign of the way that the band was leaning. Which was and is, ok. All bands need to evolve, nothing stays the same forever, and of course, shouldn't. But all in all, this is a very good album, and a must for true fans of Genesis. The booklet includes all lyrics.
B00000IMTF|5.0|From the amazing album cover to the excellnt music to the brilliant production, this is the 1st power metal album. Ronnie James Dio's brilliant as always, and Ritchie Blackmore's solos really wail. Jimmy Bain's bass is really reconizable, and Cozy Powell...man. WOW! No one gives this credit. Is that double-bass I hear? Excellent drummer. And Tony Carey's solos are incredible. No a song by song review:<br />1.Tarot Woman-Execellent intro done by Tony. Echo and weird braah sounds coming from the keyboards. Then the band kicks in to a power metal classic. Perfect and hypnotizing. 5/5<br />2.Run With The Wolf-Good bluesy song. Great singing by Dio. 5/5<br />3.Starstruck-One of my favorites, even though it sounds too much like Deep Purple. Weird lyrics. 4/5<br />4.Do You Close Your Eyes-Just filler. Skip it. No solo. 2/5<br />5.Stargazer-NOW THE ALBUM REALLY GTS GOING! Perfect orchestra, solos, singing, and drum intro. Espiecially the 2 minute ending. It can make you cry. It's that good. 10/10<br />6.Light In The Black-Not enough distortion in the begining, but the singing and fast pace make it great. Check out the 3 minute blazing solos. Cool. 5/5<br />This is a great album. End of story. There should be a reunion. Highly reccomended.
B00004Z459|5.0|im not really in to the whole hip/hop rock thing, but this cd is totally different from anythin ive heard. the melodies and lyrics mix together like shaq and kobe. its one of the best cd's in my collection
6301543408|3.0|Fortunately, for the original crew of the starship Enterprise, there was one more adventure left in the form of the superb &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.&quot; Had the fifth in the series been the final bow for Kirk and company, it would have been an embarrassing end for all concerned.<br />The film, which has a few memorable exchanges and explorations of character (particularly a look at the past of Spock and McCoy, respectively) is weighted down by some truly sad scenes: Kirk making a foolish attempt at rock climbing; Uhura doing a &quot;striptease&quot; in the attempt to divert the minions of Sybok; the cheesy special effects (Where was ILM on this one?); the entire crew looking rather &quot;bloated&quot; in newly-designed &quot;jumpsuits\\"; Kirk, McCoy, and Spock escaping incarceration via rocket shoes; a Klingon crew that is as skilled as the guys on the old &quot;McHale's Navy&quot; television show; and the appearance of &quot;God&quot; that might make one consider atheism.<br />As a Trekker, I really wanted to like the film.  Subsequent viewings have not improved my opinion.<br />I think I may have been too kind in giving the film three stars.
6303012140|4.0|To one of the previous reviewers:  No you're not alone in thinking Sandra Bullock looks cute in her cop uniform.  Forget Stallone, Sandra's tight pants do it for me.  Enjoy!
6305388458|5.0|This is an achievement unequalled in filmdom. It's biting satire that hits its target dead-on, shedding real light on the irrational behavior of people. Here, Monty Python has transcended comedy and become an agent of change in the world.<br />Which is, of course, not to slight the comedy of the film. Quite aside from the satire, this film has more side-splitting humor than any other film I can think of. An astounding piece of work.
0140177396|5.0|Although an excellent book, it is very short. JS is excellent at creating characters and if you do like this then the Grapes of Wrath is an obvious next read.
B00003CWN3|3.0|I will join in giving this movie kudos on its production values. Right off hand, I can't think of any other independent movie that has matched this one in the areas of acting and direction.<br />But I found it very hard to be moved by the film for the single reason that the characterizations were too extreme. The &quot;white trash&quot; boys were too evil, and far too much effort was spent trying to get the audience riled up against their narrow-mindedness. And Brandon Teena was way too angelic and innocent; this was completely at odds with his criminal past and his facility at lying.<br />So by the time the dramatic climax came, I felt like I was watching propoganda. This sort of overboard rendition of the story does a disservice to the real lessons of the ordeal that Brandon endured.<br />[I might have rounded this rating up to four stars, but I ended up rounding it down because of the Featurette on the DVD version - it was downright offensive. In it, the filmmakers get on-screen and gush about how this was a story about &quot;individualism&quot; and &quot;living your own life no matter what other people think.&quot; <br />In their desire to elevate Brandon to hero status, the filmmakers equate &quot;being out-of-control&quot; with &quot;being free&quot;, a bad message to be sending. With respect to Brandon, this story has a lot more to do with how his confusion over his sexual identity led to confusion in the rest of life, and how this confusion led to bad decisions and self-destruction.]
B000002N2N|5.0|This is the Ramones album to have if you missed seeing them in concert or want to remember what it like to seem them.<br />For complete effect, drink alot, play this album and have a couple of friends jump on and slam into you.
B00005AR3G|4.0|The basic story line of this movie is pedestrian, both predictable and uninspired.<br />But that's not to say it's not a fun movie. They did an admirable job of creating a fun cast of characters, and giving them lots of witty dialog and laugh-out-loud situations. Weeks later, I still find myself laughing at some of the humor.<br />This is a movie to watch when you're in the mood for something light, but with a lot of style.
B00004XQ83|5.0|It is a pleasure to find a soundtrack that is a collection of music actually used in the film.  I was initially inspired to see the movie because a family friend is one of the actors (who's also on the cd) but, after a while I was so into the music that I spent the rest of the evening looking for the nearest place to purchase the disc. I love it! I especially enjoy the song &quot;A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;. The name 'Dan Tyminski', as well as the incredible lip-sync performances given by Clooney and the boys are now, forever embedded in my memory. <br />In my unbiased opinion, this is one disc that should be a part of every music lover's collection.
0679879269|5.0|This trilogy is a superb achievment by Philip Pullman, though The Amber Spyglass is, unfortunately, the weakest of the three.  The dark menace of the first two is still there, in parts brilliantly so, and the narrative swings from this to straight battle action to a pastoral world of very strange creatures.  Some minor plot-lines seem to fade away, others make little sense, and the &quot;meanwhile back at the ranch&quot; approach could at times get very annoying!  Though given how complex the story has become I do wonder how else it could have been done - you very definitely need your brain in gear for this trilogy.<br />But I have to concede for me this is all relative - I envy anyone who is about to start reading these books.  After rationing myself to a chapter a day, more or less, I found last night some eighty or ninety pages to go, I just couldn't put the book down.  The dawning realisation of how it's going to end is as much a hammer-blow to the reader as it is to Will and Lyra - it is the most haunting, intensely sad and beautifully written conclusion to a story I think I've ever read.<br />I cannot deny that the ending is almost inevitable, in the context of the universes and what's happened, and indeed it's brutally realistic, whether we like it or not.  But I also cannot help thinking that so much has been left hanging - re-read  those final pages and the many subtle references to those things left unresolved.<br />A not dissimilar ending concludes Stephen Lawhead's The Endless Knot, the third book of his Song of Albion trilogy.  Again, intensely sad, and another story that lingers in your mind long after reading it.  But despite this, the entire story is resolved and you are at least content that it's finished for good.  Not so with The Amber Spyglass, which for me in terms of it's narrative is it's biggest flaw.<br />Philip Pullman, hopefully not unwittingly, has allowed so much potential to continue the story.  I don't believe a fourth book would 'ruin' the first trilogy, or demean it in any way - further, I actually believe a second trilogy could and would be far better than the first, given how the story has 'ended'.  I greatly anticipate The Book of Dust, but I really hope that Philip Pullman is at least toying with the idea of continuing the story of Will and Lyra.<br />So much for the wish list.  As I said earlier, I can only say that I truly envy anyone about to or just starting to read the trilogy - it is superb, and will stay in my mind for a long time.
0060278234|5.0|Lirael is of course the sequel to my all-time favorite fantasy novel, Sabriel. I was shocked to receive Lirael as a birthday gift, since I had no idea that Nix had written a sequel. I somehow never got around to reading it until about 3 months later, and I just finished it about 10 minutes ago.<br />First of all, Lirael definitely lives up to the high standards set by Sabriel. It is a fantasy that sucks you in, and lets you believe that you are really there, being stalked by Dead Hands and watched by Gore Crows. Nix tends to write dark books, but they are so vivid and horribly creepy that you can't wait to read more. It's most entertaining to read Lirael at night when you can let your imagination run free in the darkness.<br />Some of the past reviewers said that they disliked the ending because of its abruptness, and failure to tie up all the loose ends. I admit that it frustrates me, and I will sit impatiently waiting for Abhorsen to be published, but what fun would life be if we never had anything to look forward to? I congratulate Garth Nix on his success with ruffling his fans' feathers.<br />If you have read Sabriel, you will know how well Nix develops his characters. I especially liked Sameth and his very human-like personality. So many fantasy novels have fearless heroes and assertive heroines. But very few have a young man who is simply trying to please his parents, rescue his best friend, and keep himself alive while resenting the future that has been put before him. Lirael also struggles with what is expected of her. She is a Daughter of the Clayr without the sight, and it hurts her because all she has ever wanted was to fit in. However, she learns that she fits somewhere, just not where she had initially intended.<br />I enjoyed this book because of the superb character development and Sameth's and Lirael's feelings that I could identify with. I was glad that Mogget had returned--with an unfortunately meaner personality--and I loved the Disreputable Dog. The Dead things were described so vividly, and the action moved along at a great pace. I never got bored during Lirael, and I will be waiting anxiously for Abhorsen.og. The Dead things were described so vividly, and the action moved along at a great pace.

B00000IMTF|5.0|As I sit to write a few words about an album that means so much to me I start to shudder a little in anticipation and excitement. &quot;Rising&quot; is quite simply the greatest hard rock record ever! The combination of Powell, Bain, Carey, Dio and Blackmore however short lived produced absolute magic in 1976. Ronnie James Dio never sang or wrote better lyrics and next to &quot;In Rock&quot; this is Ritchie's undisputed masterpiece. &quot;Stargazer&quot;,the mystical successor to &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, blows Zeppelin and Purple away in its power and ambition. &quot;Light in the Black&quot; helped invent speed metal with its lightning quick dueling leads of Tony Carey (keyboards) and Blackmore. Carey also shines on the intro to &quot;Tarot Woman&quot; as does Cozy Powell on &quot;Stargazer&quot; and &quot;Light&quot;. I personally love &quot;Do You Close Your Eyes&quot; as a welcome mood swing contrasting with the evil magic on much of the album. Witches, wizards, slaves and masters all parade through the black night created by Blackmore and co. I believe this was the album Ritchie always wanted to make after &quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot; but it took him six years to find the right conspirators. Rainbow followed up this monster with &quot;On Stage&quot; then &quot;Long Live Rock n'Roll&quot; (an album which is almost as breathtaking) which proved to be Dio's curtain call with the band. Rainbow could have been the greatest metal band ever but it was never the same after &quot;Rising&quot; and &quot;LLRNR&quot; as Blackmore chose to pursue commercial success over artistic genius. &quot;Rising&quot; is THE gothic metal classic, nothing else comes close.
0064407667|5.0|This book is a black comedy for children. Along the lines of Creepy Susan. Amusing and funny I can hardley wait for the new books to come out. I have read them all in order and I adore them. They are a great time filler while waiting for the next Potter book. This book series is a bit dim,but with light edge. I recommend it to middle readers only though unless being read by a parent. Some small children may feel scared when the book's childrens parents die. Dont worry I gave nothing away. good luck and good reading
0385335482|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud from the first page. Every woman who loves to shop should read this book. And if you don't love to shop you should read it anyway as it is halarious! Most of the book reminded me of a British version of a Saturday Night Live skit. Full applause goes to Sophie Kinsella, bravo!
B000001ESN|5.0|Simply put: This is one of Rush's best albums. Buy it. Also, buy Moving Pictures.
0805062971|4.0|I saw the movie when it first came out, and it was the first time that I was able to put a finger on the frustration of living. Since then, I've seen the movie no less than 50 times, and have the DVD copy. After reading the book in about 4 hours straight, I couldn't decide which I preferred. But I finally decided the book was better. As is true in most novel-transferred scripts, the book's events are condensed and combined in order to fit the length. But the movie loses something in the translation. The characters are more beliveable in the book, and there's no feel-good ending in the book like there is in the movie. And without going into too much detail, it's regrettable that the movie didn't stick to the truly harsher elements of Project Mayhem. It was shocking to see how far they would go in the book, something that's not made clear in the movie.  And I like the book version of Marla much better too. Her actions follow the personality of someone who's insanely suicidal.<br />All in all, even if you didn't like the movie, I recommend the book. Especially if you're want to experience the movie's meaning without the visual violence that's shown in the movie.
B0000508U6|1.0|Wow, this is really dull music!  I thought Radiohead was dull, but this makes Radiohead sound like Iron Maiden!  I can't imagine how anyone can even listen to this, it sounds like Dave Matthews on Codine.  I strongly caution anyone who operates heavy machinery to not listen to this album, it could be dangerous.  Don't listen to it while driving either.  {a few lines of &quot;Yellow&quot; pop to mind; dozes off and hits keyboard face first}rekhtdhykrehjdkflhdfh...huh?  Okay, I'm awake now.  Do  not buy this album, it is beyond mind-numbing.  The only practical use for it is for insomniacs who need help sleeping, and don't want to take pills.  This should get you sleeping soundly.
6300214826|4.0|As wonderful as it is to have a chance to see a restored print of one of the most beautifully photographed films ever made in a theater (not to mention the wonderful sound design, possibly the best in the history of sound in the cinema), it's too bad that it isn't a release of the original cut, which is superior. The original cut was great because, outside of the perfection of its cinematography and sound (Vittorio Storaro and Walter Murch are geniuses), it worked so well as an allegorical journey straight into the center of the insanity of war. &quot;Redux&quot; really harms the affectiveness of this. I didn't feel that any of the new scenes helped the film and a few really hurt it.  Overall, &quot;Redux&quot; is slower, more pretentious, and less focused. Still, additions aside, the movie is still filled with amazing moments and it's hard to complain about the chance to see it all in a theater. But if you're gonna buy a DVD, stick with the original.
B0000028M7|5.0|Being from Seattle, I could not be more proud to say that grunge was our local music scene.  It took the country by storm, and not by selling out and trying to sound mainstream, like the music of today.  They actually earned mainstream success, and changed the face of radio.  Yes, the spirit of grunge was heavy in the air here, back in the early 90's.  You could just feel it, even if you were just walking down the street to the gas station to get a soda.  In many ways, grunge is still alive, if not in music, but in our hearts.  Okay, I really gotta start talking about the album now!<br />This album is jam-packed with goodies.  AIC was one of the pioneer grunge bands, and next to Candlebox, they were the best.  You've got a lot of heavy, sludgy riffs that just crush in slow motion, eerie melodies, bone-chilling lyrics, and complex solos.  What more could you want?  I think \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Down in a Hole\\" will always be two of my favorite songs, and the creepy \\"Would?\\" is not far behind.  No one can create dark, brooding, eerie music like AIC.  This entire album is brilliant, and was once my favorite.  If you think music like Staind and Godsmack is good, you have to buy this album.  AIC is the original Staind, the original Godsmack, the original Dust for Life, the original Days of the New.  Bear in mind I like all those bands, but let's face it, they're just rippin on the masters.  If you like grunge, you really need this.  It's one of the best you'll ever buy.  Also, check out a lesser known Seattle band called Second Coming.
B000000OTU|4.0|Who would have thought that come the late 80s, one of the strongest album-rock bands of the 70s would be a singles group?  &quot;Big Ones&quot; is necessary in weeding out the good from the abundant filler, and contains the group's best work from the latter-half of their career.  And aside from &quot;Don't Wanna Miss A Thing&quot;, they haven't done anything very sucessful or interesting ever since.
B000002KBH|5.0|I first heard American Beauty sometime in early 1998 when I was trying to figure out what the Dead were all about.  I'd heard the two late 80s pop success albums and thought they were good, but didn't feel they were the crux of what they were about.  My roommate at the time had a copy and I put it on, not knowing what to expect.   It was definitely one of those &quot;what did I just hear?&quot; moments, unlike anything I'd heard before.<br />This is definitely an album that reveals more with each listen.  The songs are among the best that Lesh, Garcia, Weir, McKernan and Hunter ever created, and from a time when the band was at one of their musical peaks.  The songs are also tinged with loss as over half the band lost their parents in this time frame of 1970.  In a way, this album was part two to Workingman's Dead's part one.   Play both back to back and see what I mean.  Instead of embarking on exploratory voyages of psychedelia, the band set up in the recording studio and started to rehearse and create significant songs.  These two albums are what is meant when the Dead are referenced as being a true slice of Americana.  They cover blues, country and bluegrass, as well some beautiful music that really has no category.  And of course a little rock and roll tossed in for good measure where needed.  :)<br />Box Of Rain is an amazing song with Lesh doing some of his best singing on record.  A perfect elegy to a dying father.  Friend Of The Devil is a good bluegrass tune best fitting Garcia's young voice, before it weathered from years of abuse and cigarette smoking.  Sugar Magnolia was the first major tune Bob Weir had contributed up to that point that would lead to his being a major creative force.   Garcia's pedal steel guitar playing is also a major highlight.   Up next is Operator, a laid back country blues and Pigpen's only major contribution to the album.  He sings admirably well, with Garcia fingerpicking a good part behind him, and then plays some sweet bluesharp at the end to tie it all up.  Ripple is a moment of magic, with the added touch of having the children sing on the end.  It is a Zen masterpiece and a sweet little song.  David Grisman's mandolin also makes for a sweet touch with his fills on the &quot;ripple in still water&quot; parts.  The tone switches back to elegaic as the song segues into Brokedown Palace.  Very good singing by all here.  This song served as a prototype for others of a similar pondering later on down the line; i.e. Black Muddy River, So Many Roads, Days Between, etc.   Til The Morning Comes bounces along with more fine Garcia pedal steel playing.  Again the fine harmony singing of Lesh, Garcia and Weir makes it notable.  The sound these three created together is perfected however on the next track.  Attics Of My Life is one of the best songs the band ever came up with, and certainly features the best singing they ever did.  It almost sounds worthy of a cathedral.  A gem packed in an album with many.   To close off, there is the shuffling blues of Truckin'.  A travelogue song somewhat recalling The Beatles' The Ballad of John and Yoko, it bounces along and closes off the album.  Five years in at that point, and what a long strange trip it had been, but what a longer one waited ahead.  If you are a neophyte looking for a place to start, this is as good of a place as any.   <br />pk
B00000DCHI|5.0|A very nice summary of Billy Joel's classic period, perhaps the only CD a casual fan needs.  His actual albums were good but uneven, and just about all the highlights are here - even great non-radio tunes like &quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaraunt&quot;.  Great care seems to have been taken to include both the smash hit singles (&quot;Piano Man&quot;, &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot;) and the essential tunes you may not have heard on the radio.  In fact, there are only a couple of hits left off (on the second CD -the &quot;Innocent Man&quot; LP should have gotten a tad more attention given the number of singles it produced).  But all the stuff you'd expect is here, as well as some pleasent surprises.   The most consistant album in Joel's catalogue, this CD comes highly recommended.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Even including Madrigal, which I personally think is a lousy song, this is probably my favorite album by Rush for the following reason: It seems to be the most restrained, with the most attention paid to songs, rather than instrumentation. Everyone who's familiar with Rush knows that these guys can play their instruments exceptionally well, and as a rule, their songs seem to show off their instrumental ability, but this album, the fiery playing is turned down a notch, and the songs seems to stand out the better for it. Many people cite &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; as the most well known Rush song, and it's probably one of their simplest and most straight-forward. &quot;Xanadu&quot; is a great semi-epic, but it's also fairly straight-forward. Even Geddy Lee's helium-man vocals are turned down at tad (maybe the helium tank was running low...) It also doesn't have a whole lot of synthesizer stuff, just a touch here and there. Not to knock the synthesizer, but sometimes it can make their songs sound a little dated.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Instead of a tight sophisticated film, like Silence of The Lambs, Hannibal resorts to lots of talk, little action and what action their is is laughably bad.  People in the Theatre I went to were openingly laughing at the supposed SCARY parts.  A sad sad follow up to one of the best films ever made.
0671024256|4.0|I suppose there are many books afloat these days that are essentially writers trying to tell other writers how to actually be writers.  No one's quite sure what constitues A Writer, but a great many would likely agree that Stephen King is certainly one of them.  His book chronicles the road he traveled in venturing toward publication and, ultimately, fame.  It provides a healthy balance of instruction and inspiration.  I am certainly not the most avid fan of King's work, but this one, in reading it, spoke to me and would likely speak to anyone else attempting to figure out how to successfully construct fiction.  It's perhaps the most user-friendly of items in this incessantly expanding genre.
6303823351|5.0|I absolutely thought this movie was the best Beatle movie I've seen. I laughed, I cried, and it's got a great soundtrack too!! My sister and I are die hard Beatlemaniacs and she watches it almost everyday. It's one you never get tired of! The plot's based around Ringo so that makes it even more interesting! Buy it and enjoy!
B000001EMW|4.0|The only reason I would have to take away a star from this GREAT cd is that I've heard their two more recent releases, Inquisition Symphony and Cult where they have a more evolved and heavier sound plus original songs. But except for that this is a wonderful cd. I play cello and like Metallica as well, but when I heard about Plays Metallica By Four Cellos I was a bit confused at first and didn't think such a combination was possible until I listened to some of the songs. All I can say is that I was amazed!! WOW never have I heard anything so great!My favorites on this cd are Welcome Home (Sanitarium) and The Unforgiven because both of these fit the cello soooo perfectly!But I also have to recommend their other two cd's as well which I think are even better than this one, which is their first release. But it is still totally a great cd and I would recommend it to anyone who just plain enjoys music!
0345404475|1.0|This is one of the very rare cases where first there is a book that becomes a movie; and then this movie is so much better than the book. Normaly it´s the reverse (however this rule generally does not apply to books written to appear as additional merchandise with the new blockbuster).<br />The movie (that thankfully did stray very far from this book) is &quot;Blade Runner&quot; - one of my all-time favorites. Maybe even the best scifi-movie ever. But the book .... . OK, I don´t really like Dick. But still, this book is a low even for him. So take my advise: dump it, but get the movie ASAP!
0385501560|2.0|Fight Club is one of my favorite books; thus, I was quite disappointed after reading Choke.  The book is entitled Choke because the main character, Victor, has set up a scam in which he pretends to choke in restaurants.  By doing so he gives some would-be heros the opportunity to save his life.  Now, here's the part that is completely inane and unbelievable: the people who supposedly save Victor's life become permanently indebted to HIM!! They send HIM money! Come on, Chuck. Shouldn't it be the other way around? <br />Ok, I realize we're not supposed to take everything in this book literally, but that's just one example of many within Choke that are either just plain silly or pointless (See also: rubber balls and impacted bowels).<br />Fight Club is a cool book with a clear message and a decent plot.  Choke is neither cool nor does it set forth any kind of message and it is almost completely devoid of plot.  I can't help but think that Mr. Palahniuk's aim in writing Choke was simply to shock the reader with graphic depictions of sex that border on the pornographic. (I guess I should have been forewarned after reading on the book jacket that portions of Choke have appeared in Playboy -- not exactly a literary magazine).<br />I've read Fight Club several times; my copy is filled with underlined and highlighted passages.  My copy of Choke, I'm sorry to say, is headed for the trash. It was just too much for me to choke down.
0684800713|5.0|I first read this book about a year ago for a high school english assignment. Usually, I find reading very tiresome, boring, and uninteresting. This book changed my outlook on reading. It is a fast read, and does not leave the reader bored after the first 50 pages. It also gave me an opportunity to learn about this interesting generation of young people. A must read for everyone.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I saw this movie after I saw the first movie from Guy Ritchie, Lock Stock and Two Barrels. I initially thought the same type of visual affects would not work but little did I know that it can be re-used to better the action. The story line was a little faster and more involved then the previous. <BR> The acting for this movie was always on queue. The combination of old and new actors was a great mix. Del Toro, Pitt and Statham were perfect selections for the roles.<BR> The special edition DVD has interesting commentary with deleted scenes that should be watched just to see how the director had a difficult time to select the proper scenes.<BR> The interactive menus also add value to the DVD experience. The scene I recommend is the before last scene in the boxing ring.<BR> I gave the DVD 5 stars because I enjoy watching it every time I place it in the player.<BR> Enjoy the Show!
0790732254|5.0|Of all the stage play adaptations that have been made this one is one of my top favorites. After many years it still holds up and has proven to be a stage and film classic. The story as many know concerns an old, alchoholic, and strange (to say the least) couple, Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) and George (Richard Burton) who invite a young couple over for a late night visit over drinks only to have the whole night become a nightmare, all orchestrated by Martha and George. The night changes all their lives forever. The adaptation of the play could not be better. It shows you how under certain circumstances the devil inside you can be unleashed. Martha and George take out their repressed feelings on their guests which in turn affects thier guests emotionally and along the way painful discoveries are made which are about themselves and who they are and about each other's personal lives. The dialogue is sardonic, witty at times, and by the standards of the time in which this movie came out it is daring and obscene at times. The characters are people  who you might very well know in real life and they are very well drawn out. This movie is mainly character exposition and study. And the direction expands the play but keeps the intimate feeling of the stage play and it is  directed with a kind of gritty realism in some parts. The black and white cinematography is great and it just enhances the mood and feeling of the movie. Had it been filmed in color i am not sure it would have had the complete impact it has. The acting is near flawless in this movie. Elizabeth Taylor deservedly won the oscar for her best performance. She exudes raw energy, vulnerability, rage and she is sardonic. She was laughed at when she said she would play the part. She had the last laugh. She dared to go dowdy and old for the part (in real life she was younger and slimer, here she is old and not eaxctly in great shape). Richard Burton shows repressed anger and sadness as George and he goes from showing it subtly to just screaming and acting it out( at one point he breaks a botttle of beer and nearly strangles someone to death). Sandy Dennis who won a best supporting actress oscar starts off as a mousy little woman to a woman who can barely control her emotions. George Segal's character is the only one who manages to maintain some sanity in this movie though he does go off the deep end at times too. He is righteous and a devil-may-care at once. This movie is an experience which will linger in your mind for a long time after and it requieres repeat viewings. This is a truely unique tour de force film experience. And it gives you an idea of how La Liz and her hubby Richard might have been behind closed doors since they too were on the bottle for a while.
B000002BE9|5.0|When I first bought &quot;Tidal&quot;, I was shocked to discover that the frail looking creature on the cover had such a deep and sensuous voice.  Her voice is reflective of the passion she has for expressing her emotions (in the most eloquent way.)  One becomes tantilized with her striking, original melodies, and only grows fonder of her songs upon learning- and discovering the meaning behind- the lyrics.  So many musicians sing of emotions with which they think we can all identify, without really having anything personal at stake.  Fiona bears her soul through her music, and it is obvious that she has carefully considered how to express herself most clearly and poetically.  No longer can I sleep without hearing my favorite songs from her CD- especially Slow Like Honey.  The diverse range of feelings about which she sings reveals her multi-facetedness and makes it easy to identify with her.  This CD is a worthy investment... and would be for ten times as much money!
B00003XB8K|5.0|This CD is awesome!  If you like good music for thinking and contemplation, this is it!  Enigma has done it before, and they set the standards even higher with this CD!      &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; is the best track on the CD, and all the others are close behind.  It is best to listen to this one at night, while you are alone, because this is the only time you will really feel the music - it has many hidden messages.    Whether you listen to this one for pure enjoyment (like I do), or for meditation (many people do), it's a great CD that everyone should give a try.
B00004RFDW|5.0|Can you imagine a scientist standing up against the tobacco industry? Can you imagine this scientist recorded a segment on 60 minutes and that 60 minutes refused to air the program because of political pressure? This really happened. Russell Crowe is fascinating in this study of a man caught between morality and saving him self and his family from psychological torture. Al Pacino plays the producer who ultimately gets the scientists testimony heard after going to the New York Times with the story. This is a story that every one can relate to. It is gripping. Crowe should have won an academy award for his performance.
B00003Q43A|4.0|Independence Day. Full of special effects, aliens, airplanes, UFOs, and big big explosions. All kinds of fun stuff! When earth is targeted by a clan of power-hungry aliens, the President and a group of unexpected people must help save the world. <br />  This has got to be one of the funnest movies out there. It's got everything needed in a movie. Action (That's what the movie is all about), drama (A couple of subplots that were dealt with very nicely and not left open), comedy (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Randy Quaid - what do you expect from these great actors?), horror (I count the &quot;jump&quot; moments given by the aliens as horror), and of course, science fiction (Er...the aliens). The extensive cast is full of A list actors and actresses, as well as some unknowns, and all pull through with great performances. And I must say, when Bill Pullman gives his own &quot;Independence Day&quot; speech, I was ready to fight the aliens with them. I also enjoyed how each group of characters were given their own subplots, and those subplots were closed and didn't leave the viewers wondering how what would have happened. The special effects in ID4 were amazing. It was pretty fun to see Washington DC, Paris, and other big cities get blown to pieces. The aerial fights were also pretty awesome.<br />  The DVD lives up to its &quot;5 Star Collection&quot; title. We get the original theatrical release on one disc, and the uncut version on another. The chapter list even tells us when things are added and extended. Although there's only a 9 minute difference, it was still interesting to see it. The alternate ending is also very interesting. The &quot;fake-amentaries&quot; and news reports are fun to watch. There's plenty of stuff here to keep you busy for at least a couple of hours. There's even 2 easter eggs. I'll let you find them. <br /> Independence Day is a fun action romp, and is fun every time you watch it. I'm glad it was given a worthy DVD.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This was the greatest movie I've ever seen.  I've seen other Ewan and  Nicole movie before but I think this movie had to be one of their greatest yet.  They both sang really well. ANd the acting I found to be excellent.  Not many actor and directors can pull off the singing and acting thing well but this movie pulls it off nicely.  I can't wait til It comes on DVD!  If anyone knows when its due out. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET- GOOO!!!  It's wonderful
6305903182|5.0|Scream gave us the motives and the major storyline, Scream 2 lengthened the storyline, and Scream 3 settled the motives and the storyline. That's how the trilogy went, and it was a fun ride. <br /> And in the third and final Scream, we see that Sidney is in hiding in the California hills and is ultimately paranoid. But who can blame her? She's only had 4 psychos kill almost 15 of her friends or people close to her. Meanwhile, Stab 3 is currently in production, with a now successful Cotton making a cameo in the movie and Dewey being a technical advisor on the movie. Suddenly, bodies began to turn up, and the killer leaves pictures of a young Sidney's mother with every victim. Now Sidney, Dewey, and Gale (who thinks she's hot on the case) and the remaining cast and crew of Stab 3 must try to survive, and Sidney must try to discover who the killer is, and why the pictures of her mother are turning up.<br />  With another all star cast, and great writing, Scream 3 ended the Scream trilogy in a way that combined all three Screams with a very surprising plot twist. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courtney Cox-Arquette give their characters their usual moods and tones, and do it well. I personally love Courtney's character, Gale Weathers. New additions in Scream 3 are Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey, Lance Henricksen, Jenny McCarthy, and many more talented actors. Parker Posey was certainly there for comedic relief. She was hilarious. There are also some surprise cameos. Ehren Kruger took over as writer, and did very well. As Scream movies do, they poke fun at the horror genre. Specifically a scene with Jenny McCarthy's character in which she complains about being having to die naked in Stab 3. And as with Scream and Scream 2, the horror-meister Wes Craven was in the director's chair. Wes' directing style is perfect for horror movies, and is very respectable to the genre. <br />  I love the Scream Trilogy, but I would NOT want another Scream. It ended the way it was supposed to, and if there is another, it would totally ruin the whole thing.<br /> As for the DVD, I thank Dimension Home Video for it. The video and audio transfers are great. We are TREATED with an assortment of deleted scenes or alternate takes, including an alternate ending. Although there really isn't much difference, it was still fun to watch. The commentary given by Wes and some of the crew is very interesting and they never quit talking, which is a good thing in this commentary's case because they always have something interesting to say. Other features include the Creed video &quot;What If&quot;, theatrical trailer, outtakes from all Screams (Very funny), and a lot of TV Spots. No dissapointment is in this disc, nor the movie.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Bloody but good. Not much of a Story.
0790729687|5.0|Interview with the Vampire is a pure example of what good horror should be. Actually, I would classify it as a Dramatic Horror because that's simply what it is. Interview tells the story of a 200 year old vampire (Brad Pitt) who isn't happy with being what he is. A vampire. In the present day, we see him telling his life story to a man (Christian Slater). As he tells it, we see the story play out. How he, Louie, became the vampire he is, and how it almost destroyed him. Lestat (Tom Cruise) is the vampire who made Louie. Their relationship is shown as a love / hate type thing where it seems as if Lestat only puts up with Louie because he has too. Not being a respectable vampire, Louie only wants to drink the blood of animals and not harm a human being, but the first person he does harm, puts a burden on not only him but Lestat also. It was a little girl (Kirsten Dunst), and Lestat decides to change her into one of them, and make her their &quot;daughter.&quot; That, and what occurs after that, is a very interesting and never dulls. It keeps your attention, and the characters take your emotions.<br />  The actors who portrayed the characters in the film were astounding. I believe this is Tom Cruise's best part to date. He brought life to an undead character, and a character who would not die. Brad Pitt's eyes brought soul to the character of Louie, there was real depth there. But the most superb is the acting of Kirsten Dunst. Only at the tender age of 11, her acting spoke volumes as the role of Claudia. In the movie, her soul aged but her faced never changed, and Kirsten worked very well with that. <br />  The mood is set just right in every scene. The tone of the movie is dark, and mostly all of the colors are dark. Sometimes a dull bright green will contrast with the colors, but it only makes the tone better.<br />  Interview with the Vampire is a beautiful, if twisted, story of love and faith that can even be given by the darkest of souls.
B00005B7CK|4.0|I've seen Fargo by the Coen brothers about 10 times, and this is not as good.  But it is worth seeing for the acting (George Clooney is greasy and good) and the wonderful down-home America music.  A member of a Missouri Bluegrass Band told me this movie is a great showcase for bluegrass.  And it is. But the film lags when the music fades down, although it rises to a super high at a critical moment, a big gathering, where the music of the fugitives even gets the Governor a dancing. Go see it and turn up the volume.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Cruel Intentions shied away from the usual setting of a stereotypical high school setting, and put us in the middle of Upper Class New York. We are introduced to Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Sebastian (Ryan Phillipe) who are spoiled and manipulative people who couldn't care less about anyone. Kathryn bets Sebastian that he can't seduce virgin Annette (Reese Witherspoon) into losing her virginity, and as a side task, she also wants him to ruin Cecile's (Selma Blair) life because she stole Kathryn's boyfriend. Oh the woe. Sebastian takes up both of these offers, and works at both of them. But unexpectedly, falls in love with Annette, and now must fight an emotional war.<br />  Cruel Intentions could be seen as a distasteful movie, but it really isn't. It's full of talented people, and the direction is quiet brilliant. Sarah Michelle Gellar steps out of her usual goody goody roles and steps into the shoes of Kathryn Merteiul, a crack snorting, sex addicted manipulator who gets joy out of ruining people's lives. And she does it well. Her given facial expressions really gave depth to the character. Sarah is a wonderful actress (Yes, she's my favorite). Ryan Phillipe did well as the snooty Sebastian Valmont, and completed the change his character went through with great ease. Reese Witherspoon was perfect for her role as Annette Hargrove. Her face cried &quot;Innocence,&quot; and Selma Blair was hilarious as Cecile. The remaining cast - Sean Patrick Thomas, Christine Baranski, Eric Mabius, Joshua Jackson - all did well in their roles. Roger Krumble's direction is great. The sets were beautiful, and I also found myself paying attention to some of the camera work, which was awesome.<br />  The Special Edition DVD has some notable features on it. The two featurettes (One on the movie and another focusing on the set designs) were interesting and are filled with cast and crew interviews. The commentary with director Roger Krumble was interesting, although it dulled sometimes. The highlight of the disc are the 6 deleted scenes. Each scene is introduced by Roger Krumble. He explains the scenes and gives the reason why there were taken out of the movie. Also included are two music videos and the theatrical trailer.<br />  Cruel Intentions is a nicely sculpted drama with a great cast. Definitely worth the watch.
0805062971|4.0|In a world where every movie based off a book is far inferior to it's namesake, Fight Club breaks the mold. Whether it's because the movie is so awesome, or the book is so-so, I really couldn't tell you. But spend your money on the DVD Edition of Fight Club and just get the book from the libraray. Or shoplift it. You'll be glad you did.
0790733900|5.0|Cool Hand Luke fits into an elite group of movies (along with The Outlaw Josey Wales, Shawshank Redemption, and Jaws) that have the ability to draw you in no matter how many times you've seen them. I can be channel surfing and no matter what time it is or what else is on, if I see Luke or the above mentioned others I become paralyzed and unable to change channels until the ending credits roll.<br />Cool Hand Luke is a story about a hard headed good ol' boy that just can't seem to deal very well with authority. To make it worse, he's stuck on a chain gang with a host of interesting characters (on both sides of the bars). George Kennedy gives an excellent performance as Dragline, the chain-gang leader and Strother Martin belts out his famous &quot;What we've got here is a failure to communicate&quot; line. See how many other then unknown actors make up the inmate population, it's quite a recognizable list.<br />Luke becomes popular with his co-inmates and with the audience because he's just a small, not so tough &quot;man's man&quot; with an iron will who simply wants to be left alone and refuses to conform to authority. He's the horse that can't be broke.<br />Cool Hand Luke is a funny, suspensful, dramatic, emotional ride that has timeless appeal. Thumbs WAY up!
B000002GYI|4.0|I remember the first time hearing Computer World as a mind blowing experience. Of course most people today know Kraftwerk by hearing them in other people's music. This album proves that it is possible for Electronic Music to sound great. From start to finish it takes you through the journeys of technology. &quot;Computer World&quot;,&quot;Numbers&quot;,&quot;Pocket Calculator&quot; and &quot;Computer Love&quot; are all great. It's hard to pick a favorite Kraftwerk song because all of them are unique in their own way. &quot;Trans Europe Express&quot; is also a good album. Made popular again in the 80's by Afrika Bambaataa in his song Planet Rock.
B000002OX7|5.0|Happy 30th to the boys  a true accomplishement
B000059T00|4.0|I was one of the lucky ones to get the original issue of this CD without the two bonus tracks. The reason that this is Four Stars is because you can't get this now without the two bonus tracks. The two bonus tracks threw this off when it was reissued. Everything about this is great. What a lineup too Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Rick Grech and Ginger Baker. One of Winwood's best songs is included here &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot;. Also the Eric Clapton penned &quot;Presence Of The Lord&quot; is very good. Not everyday do you get four talented musicians like this together. Unfortunately, there probably won't be a Blind Faith Part Two because of the passing of Rick Grech. That is why many people consider this a Landmark recording. A one time thing gone right. By the way, they just reissued this as a double CD with more extra tracks. Do yourself a favor, pass it up. It's not as good as the original. Damn those bonus tracks.
B000002V0Q|5.0|Dave Mustaine once admitted he wanted Countdown To Extinction to be Megadeth's &quot;Metallica-Killer.&quot; And quite frankly, I think he succeeded. Countdown to Extinction is an excellent Megadeth album and stands as my second favorite by the band. Only Youthanasia is better IMO (though not by much). <br />Some people felt Youthanasia was Megadeth's &quot;sell out album.&quot; Well, what they don't seem to realize is that Megadeth's slight change in sound really began with this album. Its songs are a bit slower than in earlier Megadeth releases, and they have a slightly more mainstream sound to them. And yet, some waited until the later Youth came out to say the band sold out. I guess Youthanasia suffered from what I like to call the &quot;Eb syndrom.&quot; It seems that whenever a band tunes their guitars down to that key (also Ab in some songs), people claim their music got &quot;a complete make-over&quot; and the band sold out. As funny as it may seem, this has happened to a lot of bands: Metallica with their Load album, Ozzy Osbourne with The Ultimate Sin, and Megadeth with Youthanasia. Of course, Youthanasia still sounded like a Megadeth album regardless. Just a more atmospheric and melodic Megadeth album, which is what makes it the band's best IMO. <br />Countdown To Extinction's strongest point is its immense personality. The songs here are very catchy and (as with Youthanasia), are really something you can play in your mind during daily life. This, again, is mostly due to the fact that they're a bit slower than in earlier Megadethers, making them quite a bit easier to remember.<br />The album also has something many other metal albums don't have: A sense of humor. Mustaine constantly makes humorous references to real life situations and even expresses a lot of his thoughts in a humorous fashion. This is most evident in the song Sweating Bullets, where the verses are spoken in a manner that is likely to make even the most grumpy metal head crack a smile. <br />Other great songs include Skin O' My Teeth (which has a very catchy chorus and a good solo), Symphony of Destruction (with its neat riff and also catchy chorus), Architecture of Aggression (just an all around great song), Captive Honor (the funny court scene in this song is bound to make you laugh), and the title track (which seems to borrow its riff from a small portion of the Metallica song Ride The Lightning). Ashes in your Mouth is also a plus. <br />So overall, Countdown To Extinction is a great Megadeth album. If you're at the record store and confused as to whether you should buy Metallica's Black Album or this album, I strongly suggest you choose this one. Once you give it a listen you will see why.
B000003S0I|5.0|This is like nothing you've ever heard before. This was one of the best lineups King Crimson has had. I have never heard any band that can play like these guys. A friend in college turned me on to this album as well as the follow-up Starless and Bible Black. When I first heard this I was driving in my car and had to pull over. I couldn't believe it. Each and every person I have played this for have been blown away. With the opening track alone you can't wait to see what happens next. &quot;Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Part I&quot; starts it off and then into a great John Wetton ballad &quot;Book Of Saturday&quot;. This whole &quot;musical experience&quot; keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish while it plays with the brain a little. The riffs of &quot;Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Part II&quot; hit you like a truck. Thank God For King Crimson. The lineup on this includes Robert Fripp, John Wetton, David Cross, and Bill Bruford. excellent listening.
B000003NA4|5.0|This album is one of my all time favorites.  Diana Krall expresses emotion and spectacular singing quality. A must have fo all traditional jazz fans.
B000003S09|5.0|A debut phenomenon. What a way to start out a career in music. Robert Fripp's band takes you on a fantastic musical journey. This is also Greg Lake's first recordings before he gained fame with Emerson Lake and Palmer. Starts off with the heavy &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; and ends with the  Meloncholy sounds of &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot;. The inbetween tracks are also fantastic. It's amazing that two key members from this album went on to form huge groups later on. Greg Lake (Emerson Lake and Palmer) and Ian McDonald (Foreigner). This is a must have in any collection. I enjoy listening to this.
B00005KHL0|5.0|i recently recieved my copy of this video, and I love it. It is a must-have for any Halloween fan. We only get the movie on television 2 times a year, so it is not that often I get to see the television add-ins. So once again, I love this film, especially in its newly rendered screening (higher quality). I own the old version and it is really nothing compared ot this one. Its great!
0553528521|5.0|Chefs may know everything about the contents of this book, but few would have dared write it down so frankly.  As Bourdain reminds us, good food, good eating is all about blood and organs, cruelty and decay.  Not since Orwells Down and Out in London and Paris has there been such a frank look at the artists of the kitchen.  This is the book for the chef, who has tied his drunk dishy to the sink in the hope hell make it through service, or bailed out their second chef so they could come to work. Add to that forgiving all sorts of antisocial behaviour because the hours are inhumane and it takes more stamina than most normal people have naturally to be good at.  It is the book for the chef who has forgiven and forgiven his most loved and most talented staff for every misdemeanour from coming to work stoned to going missing for a couple of days and much worse. It is the book for the good domestic cook who believes in near death experiences and wants to open their own restaurant.  It is the book for every chef who has worked sixteen hour days plus for most of their lives, had good employers, bad employers, gone broke, made fortunes, worked with good people, bad people and marvelled at sheer driven genius that can put magic on a plate.  It is about mystical synergy of the culinary magician who makes the perfect bread, can trick and cajole the perfect soufflé from the humble egg; it is about the chef who will work for days for the great dinner for hundreds without ever questioning why.  It is for the chef with the dream of the most fabulous restaurant with the most fabulous food and the dream that tumbles with their money or someone elses into the ashes of their ambitions.  Bourdain knows the adrenalin that gets you through an eighteen hour day and leaves you sleepless thinking of what next, or still arguing about food in some scruffy bar when the sun comes up, just an eye blink before you have to start work again.  Bourdain has written about a lifestyle that few outside the family would understand, will understand.<br />Bourdain writes about the super tough women that survive in testosterone hell, who find their way to the top and stay there without thinking for one second they cannot cut the pace.  Kitchen Confidential borders between Hunter S. Thompsons Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the more modern Jello Salad by James Billincoe.  It is a riveting, shocking read that will leave families reliving some of their best and worst moments, and the public wondering if they should ever enter a restaurant again.  No one is left untouched, but for those diners who still insist on well done we refer you to page 69.
0440214041|4.0|Pelican Brief isn't one of Grisham's strongest novels but it's certainly a page-turner, it moves with amazing speed, and it's a heck of a lot better than some of his later stuff, like The Street Lawyer or A Painted House. Many of  Grisham's novels rely upon courtroom drama - on one lawyer versus another, with some clever legal or psychological trick thrown in for good measure. Pelican Brief relies almost totally on action. Two Supreme Court justices die on the same day. Darby Shaw, a law student comes up with an ingenious theory - they were shot and strangled by an international terrorist so that the conservative president would appoint new, conservative justices who will help out a case involving an industrialist who's no friend of the tree-huggers. Darby's boyfriend, Thomas, gets dissected by a car bomb meant for Darby. She uses her 'get out of hospital free' card and hooks up with a Washington Post reporter, Gray Grantham. But bad guy terrorist is after her and everyone starts dying...<br />Pelican Brief's a fun story - not to be taken too seriously - and will provide an entertaining few hours while the dinner's cooking. But don't expect too much else.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I normally don't like to giveaway any plot points when wrting a review. I feel it spoils the movie for future watchers. And Traffic will not be an exception. However, I must say that I am a hardcore movie buff, and Traffic is for sure on my Top 5 ever!! The acting (of special notice is Del Toro) is flawless. The characters truly make you believe they're stories. It is uncanny. The movie also sports 3 color schemes to let you know, what &quot;part&quot; of the story your in. The directing by Soderbourg is indeed masterpiece work. Traffic has a &quot;documentary&quot; feel, so it adds to the realism of the drug problem in real life. One would think that it's a live recording of actuall happenings. Overall, the direction makes it stand out from any other movie Hollywood has &quot;greenlit&quot; in a while. And again...Del Toro's performance is astonishing. One of the best, most real characters I've seen in a very, very long time.<br />Neo101
6301247485|5.0|Didn't read the book, had a test the next day.  Thank god I bought the movie.
6305078564|4.0|The movie itself is absolutely wonderful. It is one of the rare items that I will dedicate 5+ hours worth of time watching from beginning to end. I could even sit down and watch it twice. However, the DVD quality is not so grand. The miniseries is put together poorly, leaving obvious pauses etc and it doesn't flow easily. Well worth it anyway and won't stop me from dedicating a rainy day to it several more times. Truly well done by all actors and directed beautifully.
B00000IPAX|3.0|Ok, after &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; and &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, there was no doubt that blink-182 was gonna be a no-sellout punk band that would rock forever...after &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, I wasn't sure. There's too much pop appeal, not enough gritty punk rock. Punk fans got sick of seeing &quot;What's My Age Again?&quot; and &quot;All The Small Things&quot; on TRL with crap like The Backstreet Boys and N'SYNC...not good company for any punk band. This CD is full of catchy, pop-punk, and that's just what's wrong with it. This is music that's ment to sell. Blink's old music was just crappy juvenile punk rock, the good stuff. Not that there's none of that on &quot;Enema...&quot;, tracks like &quot;Anthem&quot;, &quot;Dysentary Gary&quot; and &quot;Mutt&quot; rock on a CD full of songs that are for the radio. &quot;Adam's Song&quot;, ironically enough, was on the radio, but is still a good song, straight from the heart and just a good piece of music in general, one of blink's better songs...I've said a lot so far, but this is a hard CD for me to describe. Blink-182 is one of my favorite bands, and there really isn't a BAD song on this CD (except for &quot;The Party Song&quot;...trash) A lot of them just sound really REALLY poppy and they get old, i got sick of hearing them. If i could say one thing to blink, it'd be &quot;Don't worry about the fans you share with Backstreet Boys and N'SYNC, worry about the fans you share with Bouncing Souls and NOFX&quot;...by no means a terrible CD, but not a great, or even very good one. A step in the wrong direction for a great punk band.
0783117388|4.0|I'd have to say that the portrayals of the women are pretty pathetic.  I really don't know any high class, high paid women like Sam who hop in and out of the sack and are happy about it.  If she were 22 then I'd understand but come on it's just downright sickening.  She obviously has issues.  They all have issues.  They live in the center of the universe and all of them have trouble finding a man.  These women are going to wind up single and alone forever.  Yes, even Charlotte who's married and divorced she'll be alone also.  There are no perfect men out there.  <br />If you're waiting for perfection you'll have a long wait.  I'm deeply disturbed by the way that sex is treated so casually especially by the Samantha character.  Her behavior is downright Conditesque!!  It's borderline psychotic!!  Men if you meet a woman who's happy to hop from bed, to bed, to bed run like the wind.  Does the film &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; ring any bells?<br />The only real women in the world who act like these women are women with severe emotional issues.  They all need to be in counseling.  But hey they're living the American dream.  Go to college, get a high paying job you should be happy after that right?  This show only goes to show people that there's more to life than that.  If you have no soul or moral compass you have no life.
B00005MAM2|1.0|How is it possible to make two translations of the same darn script nearly unrecognizable?  I don't know, but the people at Pioneer have managed to do that.  Don't buy this DVD if you're hoping to get the same Akira that you've watched since 1988.  It's not the same move AT ALL!!!  The images are the same, the sound is WAY BETTER, but the voices, dialog and sentences are completely different with entirely new phrases, whole paragraphs missing, entire explanations dumbed down to Idiot American levels and, all in all, ruined.<br />Yes, I'm outraged.<br />Maybe, if enough people grumble about the massacre of a great classic Pioneer will re-re-release this DVD with the original dialogue, no matter if it's up to par with Dolby Digital standards or not.<br />They've drained the blood from this great story.  Buy this DVD and you buy a husk.  A shell.  A lump of skin with no guts.  Welcome to junk.
0452282152|5.0|I loved this book!  The painting on the cover of the book caught my attention and I could not stop reading. Griet was wonderful!  The story read like a painting.   Just as Vermeer's work looks like photographs of daily life. When I finished this book I felt like i had lived in that time and place also.  And under different circumstances, Griet could hve been a great painter also!
0060392886|5.0|I was never a big Crue fan and I have never bought any of their albums but I did think their \\"Behind the Music\\" on VH1 was one of the most interesting.  Well, the book is a thousand times better.  I couldn't put it down.  These guys tell all and don't care about naming names.  More people from mainstream Hollywood turn up in this book than I could've ever imagined.  And according to Motley Crue, they are all blood-sucking, sex-craved, money grubbing psycho's!  And I have a feeling they are telling the TRUTH!  This book made feel naive! Enjoy.
0425180638|3.0|As a Virginia native, I am quite excited when Patricia Cornwell comes out with a new novel. THE LAST PRECINCT was no exception. However, I found the book hard to get into and drawn out. The plot takes forever to unfold, and lots of the information is unecessary. The book was ok, and if you like Cornwell's works or are a die hard fan read THE LAST PRECINCT.<br />    Following the events of Cornwell's BLACK NOTICE, we find Dr. Kay Scarpetta in rare form. She has just had an encounter with &quot;The Werewolf&quot; also known as the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Chandonne. This leaves her shocked, vulnerable, scared, and a suspect for murder. She will be required to look deep within herself to find the answers to several questions and to clear her good name. During this journey, she will find answers to things she did not want to know. We gather that she will never be the same again after all the things that happens to her. <br />   THE LAST PRECINCT was an ok book. Cornwell mainly wrote it to tie up loose ends from all her other books. This can be quite helpful if you are interested. Ultimately, Cornwell could have done better. However,THE LAST PRECINCT has a little to offer. Buy it today.
6302752337|3.0|I am 25 years old right now, and the first time I saw this movie, I had no clue what they were trying to get across. Now I am fascinated by it, and its controvery is far more apparent to me. My best recomendation to anyone who is going to see this for the first time and did not live in the 60s is to learn more about the time period first. That way, when you see Henry Fonda stuffing money into his gas tank so he can buy drugs on his road trip, you will realize that the mainstream reaction was &quot;Oh my lord, how can someone do such a thing, like actually plan out that they know that they will want drugs in the near future.&quot; And there is even more to that shot besides what I have tried to articulate. So there is no sure fire way to explain this movie to anyone too young to remember when it first came out. However, if one makes the effort (and not an extreme one is needed) the times and feelings of the 60s can become intelligible. I can honestly say that now being able to watch this movie and understand it is a most rewarding experience for me, so all I can say is I hope it can be for others like myself.
0790734850|4.0|I always enjoy watching this movie. Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey and particularly Guy Pearce do a remarkable job portraying various angles on the LA Police Department. As a \\"period piece\\" it doesn't give you quite the nostalgic feel as does, say \\"Chinatown.\\" The story could be told just as well if set in today as in the '50's. It's a story of what it takes to get \\"justice\\" for a night-club shooting that shows there's more to it than what we're first shown. The seemingly separate stories of these three cops slowly come together as they investigate their own individual crimes. And the climatic scene is one of the best of its type that I've seen in quite a while. It's still exciting to watch even after you know the outcome. It is one of the best movies of the late-nineties.
B000059HCI|5.0|A lot of movies try to explore youth and drugs. While most make some kind of bookish statement about how parents should pay attention to their kids, peers should be more accepting of each other, etc., this outstanding film shows the real hopes and aspirations of a lot of people who live a drug life. Indeed, there is an escape element that we typically associate with drugs, but we also see youth's fantasies for love, success, pleasure, and relief from the restrictions placed by conventional recipes for life. Moreoever, and this is where 'Req.' demolishes previous drug movies, the old mother also obtains a drug addiction of her own, reliving some of her younger dreams. Invariably, this woman has failed to satisfy her young yearnings despite living up to conventional models. Every viewer should leave this movie with doubts and questions, not answers.<br />Indeed, this is a depressing movie, extremely painful. However, it illuminates questions in life via drama (not philosophical asides). Therein lies its ultimate strength: as if this were nearly a snap shot of life shaping moments we all experience but often fail to see how our choices will affect our outcome. Hopefully, this movie can help us feel the dangers we risk today, rather than simply processing them through automatic cheese grater-like cliches.
0140288503|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  Mark Bowden is very insightful with his delivery.  You really get the feeling of being there.  If you haven't read this book...read it!!!!!
B00004U30D|5.0|Words can hardly do justice to this instant classic. A perrineal portrayal of everyday people, living everyday lives, doin very everyday types of things that we probably don't like to notice ourselves doing. The fact that Kevin Spacey can fall over walking down a crowded row of bleachers at a basketball game and look like a loser says one thing: how obsessed we are with image. Then we think, &quot;Doesn't beauty rest in image,&quot; and this movie tries to say, &quot;Not the way we think it does.&quot; The wife in this movie makes this painfully clear in the beginning with her matching apron and ratchet: a nice little thing, but hardly beautiful. As the strange adolescent guy next door illustrates, beauty is essentially something inside of ourselves. He illustrates this clearly when he is watching one of his videos, and besides just liking what he sees, he speaks in a stream of consciousness and reflection. Clearly, there is more than meets the eye in real art.<br />This symbolism described is repeated throughout the movie, and little of it is terribly new: a handsome, charming, and succesful man; rebellion by doing something unattractive; or simply deviating from routine. However, it avoids monatony by having each moment delivers something comic and develops both plot and character. It is nearly impossible to feel a lull or that you are not gaining personally from its meanings.
0380973650|4.0|Shadow, on being released from prison for serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, finds himself at the mercy of forces beyond his control.  His wife and best friend are killed in a car accident the night prior, and Shadow is suddenly loose in the world without hope and without purpose.<br />On a plane flight home to his wife's funeral, he meets an odd man, Wednesday, who knows all about him.  He convinces Shadow to join him and his exotic colleagues as his retainer to assist him in the increasingly palpable doom that approaches.  Shadow reluctantly participates in the various errands and tasks given to him, but he soon realizes that he is involved way over his head and it is too late to back out of the coming apocalypse that he is helping bring about.<br />Neil Gaiman shows his usual stuff here:  an unquestionable command of mythology and religion coupled with strong, believable (if somewhat superlative) characters, authentic dialogue and setting.  He appeals to the mythopoetic in us.  Still, I feel this would have been somewhat better captured as a graphic novel.  Gaiman is visually evocative as a writer, and his writing is up to the task of his own images.<br />For Gaiman fans, this book is mandatory.  You know the quality and style to expect from Gaiman, and he doesn't disappoint.  For those not yet fully immersed in his style, it will remind you of Stephen King, but not so long-winded and a little more cerebral.  It even can be seen as a modest foray into the mainstream.  Worth the price of admission.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya should have a place among the stars of New Age. &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is absolutely FABULOUS, and the CD is COMPLETELY explosive.  The lyrics are once again poetic, the voice warm, and the music reflective.  I REALLY love (and enjoy) the songs of &quot;A Day Without Rain (of course)&quot;, &quot;The Wild Child&quot; (in this case, it makes my soul want to go primative), &quot;Only Time&quot;, &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; (which I think it's EXTREMELY tempestuous, in some way it stirs a musical storm in my soul), &quot;Fallen Embers&quot;, &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, and &quot;Lazy Day&quot;.  I can't wait for Enya to create another CD just like this one (and others before this), and only time, has added one more fan who REALLY appreciates her talent.
0375704027|3.0|Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami is one of a long list of books on disillusioned youths looking for some purpose in their rather directionless lives. I wish I can say this book is a Japanese equivalent to A Catcher in the Rye. The author tries, tries very hard. But in the end I was disappointed.<br />The story is set in the late 1960s Tokyo. It tells the story of a lonesome, &quot;can't quite fit in&quot; young male college student and his relationship with friends and lovers, most of whom are equally disillusioned with life. His female companions are especially depressed, achingly so. ... and that's it! I wish I can say the story yields something particularly insightly or moves in a forward direction. Maybe it does for some. I found it to be a constant recycling of depressing conversation and, embarassingly, discussions of sexual relations to extruciating detail.<br />Having said all this, I am still a fan of Murakami. His The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a masterpiece. I only wish Norwegian Wood was as daring and original.<br />Bottom line: a heartfelt but ultimately tame and derivative look at the sadness and loneliness of youth.
B000002N3N|4.0|This CD is absolutley FANTASTIC!!! How can this woman do this over and over again?!?!?!?  This CD is relaxing, and I think the songs found this CD are like the day's intervals of a person's daily activities.  The song \\"The Memory of Trees\\" is like the arousal of a person from sleep, and greeting the morning sun or the welcoming of a spring rain.  The song sings of itself: a tree's memory of its youth.  Not ... only [do I]REALLY enjoy THIS song,  but I also enjoy the songs of \\"Pax Deorum\\", \\"Althair Ar Neamh\\", \\"China Roses\\", \\"Hope Has a Place\\", \\"Tea House Moon\\", and \\"On My Way Home\\".  This CD is absolutely relaxing, serene, and caliming to the tempestuous spirit.  I fall asleep with having visions as I am listening to this CD.
B000001Y5J|3.0|We all know the story - after the landmark (well, &quot;not bad&quot;, anyway) Pretty Hate Machine, Reznor became mired in legal wranglings with his record label. The result - Broken, a 33-minute-long scream of rage. Yes, he hasn't gotten any happier. Broken is filled with abrasive, grinding guitars (as opposed to the primarily synthy/technoey Pretty Hate Machine) and lots and lots of screaming. Every song is extremely vicious (and possessed of several beautifully written lines), and even the short instrumental bits (tracks 1 and 4), though quiet, are rife with abrasive sounds and background noise. The thing is, despite all of his &quot;textured industrial noise,&quot; Reznor is ultimately a pop musician at heart - Pretty Hate Machine was filled with excellent hooks, and Broken has its share of them too. The word &quot;pop&quot; here is meant as a compliment, because whenever Reznor's freakishly distorted guitars are arranged in a hook (the riff in &quot;Wish&quot; is simply great, easily the musical highlight of the album), it sounds excellent. When they're arranged in one big mess of staticky noise (with screaming in the background), it doesn't.<br />The other thing is, Trent's primary method of emoting in this album is &quot;inhuman screaming.&quot; While there's certainly eloquence in that (sometimes it's distorted so much that it sounds absolutely from the pits of hell), it grates on the nerves eventually. I know that the album is _supposed_ to be a big scream of rage, but still the best parts of Broken aren't the parts with the hellish distorted screams. There are more moving, more subtle ways to emote rage and frustration than just screaming so loudly that is sounds like you're hacking up your lungs, and the two instrumental pieces show it. &quot;Help Me I Am In Hell,&quot; for instance, is relatively quiet but brimming with menace (I kept expecting the typical predictable sonic blast any second, but it didn't come), which easily makes it one of Reznor's mostsubtle (kind of like &quot;A Warm Place&quot; on the later Downward Spiral). <br />All in all, the best songs here are &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Gave Up.&quot; Both have more discernable melodies, good hooks, the best lyrics and great choruses (my favorite is the &quot;It took you to make me realize&quot; chorus from &quot;Gave Up&quot;). &quot;Last&quot; has a groovy guitar riff, but the screaming gets upped a notch from &quot;movingly hurt&quot; (like in the aforementioned two songs) to &quot;unlistenable.&quot; The same goes for &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; - while the song may be an accomplishment of _some_ kind (hey, the video for it is basically the world's first snuff music video), it's still mostly unlistenable - towards the end, it gets to be just a very distorted scream of &quot;slavery&quot; repeated over and over). And the two hidden, unlisted tracks, while not terrible, really don't add to the overall theme of the album (that's why they're unlisted and separated by over ninety empty tracks) and have no reason to be on here - &quot;Suck&quot; is better than &quot;Physical&quot; but neither is exceptionally great.<br />Despite all that, it certainly has its moments, and since it's relatively inexpensive it's probably worth buying for the two instrumentals and the two truly awesome songs. The rest of it may be admirable (if you really, really like well-produced &quot;complicated textures,&quot; even if they're unlistenable, that is), but not very likeable.
B0000508U6|4.0|I would have given this CD a 4 1/2, but there's no 4 1/2, and it's not quite a 5, so there you go.  I think this is a great CD.  It's really exciting to see a new band put out something this good.  You are probably familiar with the song Yellow, and you should be forewarned that the rest of the CD is much more mellow and low-key, because if you bought it thinking the other songs would also have alot of electric guitar, you may be dissapointed.  You will find some in Shiver, which is my favorite on the CD, but not in most of the others.  This is a passionately sung album, and the musicianship is outstanding.  My other favorites are Don't Panic and Trouble(nice piano).  None of the tracks stand out as annoying.  Like a great album should, it all flows. I think you'll be happy with it. I'm not a big CD collector, but I broke down and bought this one and I love it.
8185300453|5.0|Words do no justice to the &quot;teachings&quot; found herein. I would recommend no other book prior to this. If one wishes to end suffering and awaken to ones true nature, this is all you shall require. With all, as all.
B00000BKDY|5.0|This album shows a big jump from Powerslave.  They incorporate a lot of synthesizers but it still rocks hard.  The &quot;Wasted Years&quot; solo is a standout, as are the guitar harmonies on &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot;.  Unfortunately I think the band started their downhill slide after this album.
014028009X|4.0|Like so many others, I've read Bridget Jones.  Both before and afterwords, I read other books about twenty-something single neurotic women.  Since I actually don't smoke incessantly and am completely non-weight obsessed, many of Bridget's qualities were more annoying than anything.  But you just gotta love Bridget no matter what.  In the movie, this is played out full-force, making Bridget more loveable than she is in the book.  As heroines go, Bridget is adorable, light, and eternally optimistic.  If you're looking for something a little darker, more realistic vision of loneliness, check out In the Drink instead by Kate Christenson.<br />But if you're going to read the book and see the movie, the rule of book first does apply here.  The movie really just picks up on Bridget's sunnier, more laughable qualities.
B000002KN8|4.0|Although I've listened to Depeche Mode since I was in junior high (Speak &amp; Spell came out when I was in 3rd grade!), I wouldn't have called myself a fan until I bought Exciter a couple of months ago.  I had also bought SOFAD and Ultra, and received some of the other albums as gifts, but it took the newest release to really initiate me into Mode Fandom.  Now I've given their past efforts another listen and really appreciate them a lot more.<br />Speak and Spell sounds like someone got trigger happy with that cheap electronic keyboard you got for your 13th birthday, the one that came with all the preprogrammed samples and cruddy drum loops.  You know the one I mean.  It's cheesy, it's simplistic, sometimes it makes you laugh out loud.  So why did I give it four stars?  Several reasons:  <br />First, the earnestness of these then-young musicians just comes through so clearly in each of these songs.  I can probably count on one hand the number of times I've listened to some new band's CD and thought, &quot;Wow, these people really sound like their hearts are in it, and they're just happy to be making music.&quot;  Usually I hear a new band's CD and think, &quot;Wow, their producer really knows how to cash in on a trend!&quot;  That's not the case with Speak &amp; Spell and it's very refreshing.  Also, it's a little piece of history, not just to nostalgic Mode fans but to anyone with an interest in tracing the development of popular music over the past 20 years.  DM's albums provide an interesting look at the past two decades of music and they're one of the few bands who've stayed relevant enough and steadily prolific enough to be able to do that.  Finally, it's oddly inspirational to hear this earnest albeit cheesy and simplistic album and then listen to something as sophisticated and mature as Exciter.  It gives me hope that one day I'll be a grown-up, too. ;-)
014028009X|5.0|I first saw the movie, which I loved, and thought that the book - as usual - would be even better.  And it is! It's great.  I don't even think the movie is too big a spoiler at all.  Bridget is precisely the sort of girl that ANY woman should be able to relate to.  She comes off as the worst version of herself at percisely the wrong moments, even though she means to be increadible as she really is -- a feeling OH-so-familiar to just about everyone i know :)<br />I did begin to get concerned about the more or less blatent rip off from Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice that is just all over the book  (c'm on!  Mr. Darcy?!), but it REALLY didn't bother me one bit.  The book is magical. Read it! You won't be sorry! :)
0684803356|5.0|This book, which I've just finished, is incredible.  To the reviews already posted I can add very little, they say the things I would say, only more eloquently.  The one thing I would like to share with readers is a point about the dialogue.  The dialogue seems to be written very strangely.  Lots of thees and thous.  I think it is because it is written as Spanish is spoken, and it is good to keep this in mind as one reads, or it can become tiresome.
B000000I3O|5.0|I love the Misfits (the Danzig era Misfits anyway), and this is definitely their best CD, although Collection II is right up there. Of the 20 tracks, there's maybe 3 I don't love. All the rest are total classics, like the always controversial Bullet, Where Eagles Dare, Teenagers From Mars, I Turned Into a Martian and Night of the Living Dead. The Misfits have a sound that's all their own and as a fellow horror movie nut, I appreciate their dark themes. If your favorite punk tunes are Blink's &quot;Girl at the Rock Show&quot; or whatever junk Green Day is putting out recently, do yourself a favor and experience the band that has influenced almost every punk act since the 70's.
0790725657|5.0|This story is such a fantastic one. It has many good messages. It reminds us to find the extrodinary in every day. It shows us how to continue the selflessness of generosity. That sometimes it isn't what you get that makes you happy but, what you do with it. The movie shows how magical the world is, when you look through another person's  perspective. This movie will hold a special place in your heart.
B000003BEV|1.0|I bought my first Stones album in 1977, at the age of 13, and I've been a loyal fan every since.  I tend to avoid Greatest Hits collections in favor of original albums as conceived by the artists.<br />In this case, I strongly advocate an exception to the rule.  Unless you are an obsessive with a need to own every Rolling Stones release, I urge that you stay away from this one.  It consists mostly of unlistenable pseudo-psychaedelic nonsense that you will never want to listen to again . . . if you make it through a first listening.<br />One song stands out, &quot;she's a rainbow&quot; - a great track.  But if you need to own this song, buy Hot Rocks II.  In this case, I'd prefer to have a mediocre Greatest Hits album in my collection than to have Satanic Majesties stinking the place up.
6305558167|5.0|Excelent movie, a must see for all who love the myth and legend arround King Arthur and The Round Table. One would expect to see more chainmail, but with all the knights in full armour suits it brings the glamour of the Knight in Shiny Armour, in its outer and inner struggles to keep an ideal made true. The passions that drive the knights are made clearly visible in this excelent story much different from what we would read in Thomas Mallory, but nevertheless to have the knights show their soft points gives a new dimension to the invicible knights.
B000002UAX|5.0|Ever since I started seriously listening to The Beatles, about 25 years ago, I have struggled with the question of which is their best album.  Sgt. Peppers is a jewel.  Every facet of it shines. It is a flawless gem.<br />But the eponymous The Beatles is something else.  It is a journey.  It is a collection of artistic renderings that transports you to another place, another state of mind.  From the classical harpsichord of Piggies to the 20's parlor rags Martha My Dear and Honey Pie, from the country/folk of I Will and Mother Nature's Son to the blues guitar in Yer Blues, from the surf-rock Back In The USSR to the hard-rock riffs in Helter Skelter and Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except For Me and My Monkey.  You will hear centuries of music in this album. You will experience a range of emotions: playfulness, anger, love, loss, joy, anxiety, peace. You will come out of this feeling like you've been somewhere, lived through something.<br />Most of all, you will feel like you have shared something with The Beatles. This is an intimate and individual album.  You will hear some of The Beatles most personal and beautiful ballads, like John Lennon's Julia, Paul McCartney's Blackbird and George Harrison's Long, Long, Long.  This is the album where The Beatles let us in for a little while, where they sang their hearts and spoke their minds.  It is a journey, but it is also a sojourn.  It is The Beatles finest work and it is impossible to truly appreciate the depths of their talents without knowing this album.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've purchased of late. I love Blur, as well as hip hop, so This hits me right where it counts.  Albarn's lyrics mixed in with Del the funk funk and mad  beats bring this album in tight. Ok, enough of my meanderings, just go buy it. WORD!
B00004Z459|5.0|I don't really remember how many different bands I've tried or how many CD's I've purchased this year from Korn, Bizkit, Staind, Disturbed, and so on, but this is by far the best CD I have purchased this year.<br />I initially purchased the CD for the song CRAWLING but I will say that Papercut and One Step Closer feed your hunger for that &quot;minor key&quot; melodrama and send you home with Chester Bennington's threatening screams.  The group then hits &quot;With You&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot; which add great riffs from Mike Shinoda.  These songs invoke some sort of visceral response because the musics grabs you and the lyrics are deep.<br />My favorite song is &quot;In the End&quot; because I like the persistently haunting piano repeating itself in the background and the the message of the song adds to the repetition.  Really listen to this one.<br />If you only buy one CD this year, make it this one.  There are easily 9 songs on this album that you will want to listen to over and over again.<br />RECOMMENDATION - DO NOT MISS!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00004X01U|4.0|Every song on this CD you can dance to.OK, I'll concede that it's not as good as 1998's Ray Of Light, but it's still worth the money.  It's like being in a club for 45 minutes. Basically, if you liked the singles off the disc, you'll like it.<br />Running time - 44:37<br />1.Music (3:44)5/5 stars Very good dance song. You've probably heard it.<br />2. Impressive Instant (3:37) 4/5 stars A very unique song blending the Parisian electro-pop sound with vocoders nicely. Makes want to get up and dance.<br />3. Runaway Lover (4:46) 3.5/5 stars Good song, with club beats<br />4. I Deserve It (4:23) 6/5 stars Why wasn't this a single.  This is a nice slow song with a nice drum beat and acoustics in the background.<br />5. Amazing (3:43) 6/5 stars This kinda sounds like Beautiful Stranger.  I hear this is the 4th single in Europe.  Now hat really pisses me off cuz I live in the US.<br />6. Nobody's Perfect (4:58) 3.5/5 stars This song addresses her critics, and has a nice vocoder effect. It sounds very soulful and makes you want to cry sometimes.<br />7. Don't Tell Me (4:40) 5/5 stars Again, you've heard this song, so I'll shut up. Go Cowgirl Madonna!<br />8. What It Feels Like For A Girl (4:43) 6/5 stars One of the disc's masterpieces.  It is a little slower than the video version ( which was banned cuz of its 'violent nature').  It has a nice message.  Like &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, it demands respect for women.<br />9. Paradise (No For Me) (6:33) 4/5 stars. This song is mainly spoken, but also has some breathy vocals.  It is known for its electronics.Mirwais Ahmadzai's production talent is shown here.<br />10. Gone (3:25) 4.5/5 stars This song is a nice way to end an album. It kinda reminds me of &quot;I Deserve It&quot;.<br />This CD is, indeed, very good, and I recommend it to any Madonna fans, or any person that likes to dance.  However, if ur just starting out as a Madonna fan, buy &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; or &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;.
B00005B7CK|2.0|I was majorly disappointed in this movie.  I had rented it because lots of folks touted the bluegrass aspect, which I did enjoy and therefore gave it 2 stars.  But, after George Clooney (Dan Tyminski) sang at the radio station the movie just went down hill.  When the scene with the cows getting run over arrived I almost decided to turn it off, but my teenaged nephew asked to watch a bit more.  However, things just got more disappointing after that and we ended up turning it off before it finished.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  Why suffer through the movie when you can just listen to the CD?
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I saw SHREK in spanish and laughed my head off - so funny, great jokes.  In spanish the movie's jokes used a lot of plays on words and double meanings which couldnt be the same in English.  I am now dying to see the movie in my native English as the jokes must be different in English.  I reckon if the DVD allows change of language and you happen to be bilingual then you will be getting two movies for the price of one! I will be getting it on DVD or video as soon as it comes out.
B000003BEV|4.0|This is definitely an underrated album. The first time I heard it, I didn't like it, but that was because I didn't understand it. At first glance it may appear to be a pretentious cash-in on contemporary trends, but THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES is actually somewhat of a parody of psychedelic silliness. &quot;In Another Land,&quot; the key to understanding the album, functions both as the quintessential psychedelic tune and as a poke at the dreamy absurdity of most of the genre. Also interesting is the fact that the Stones ventured farther East for their exotic sounds. Much of the experience seems to be lifted out of some tropical jungle inhabited by pagan savages. Check it out.
B000002P5R|4.0|It's a shame Jimi never lived to finish what he had in mind for this album. I do prefer some of the Voodoo Soup mixes of these songs, but overall, this CD offers you a better idea of what Jimi was doing from '69 to '70 than VS. My one problem with the CD, though, is the tracklisting. First Rays drags a bit at the end: all of the \\"radio-friendly,\\" shorter songs are placed in the first half of the CD, with the last several tracks being extended jams. It's like when the CD plays through the first few songs, you can't believe how good everything sounds. But then towards the end (in particular \\"Hey Baby\\" - great, but really not much more than a jam session - and \\"Astro Man\\") the songs get a little more ragged, and don't really match up with the previous tracks. Maybe if the songs had been laid out a little differently, the album would flow better...say, saving \\"Angel\\" for the last track on the CD. I also wish that \\"Pali Gap\\" was included, maybe right after \\"Dolly Dagger.\\" And as for \\"My Friend,\\" I really don't think it should be on here - \\"Drifter's Escape,\\" \\"Message to Love,\\" and \\"Pali Gap\\" are all better indications of where Jimi's music was in '70. The album sounds more like Axis than it does Electric Ladyland - the focus is on composational skill, not \\"sound paintings,\\" such as \\"1983.\\" Keep in mind, though, that this is not a finished album; only a few of the tracks were given the okay by Jimi during his lifetime. This isn't the \\"4th Jimi Hendrix album;\\" it's what the Hendrix estate believes the 4th Jimi Hendrix album might have sounded like. The fact of the matter is that no one - not the Hendrix estate, not Eddie Kramer, and not Alan Douglas - has any idea what songs would have been on Jimi's First Rays, or what they might have sounded like once he was through with them....

B000009QPG|4.0|Seasons in the Abyss follows more or less in the footsteps of the previous South of Heaven, by blending ultra-fast speed metal with some more moderate material. This time, the songwriting holds up better. All of it is good, with a variety of heavy sounds coming between 'War Ensemble' (the blistering opener) and the closing title track, which is doom-laden and atmospheric. Despite having all this in favor of it, Seasons can't quite top their 1986 classic Reign in Blood. Perhaps it's just that Slayer were better at playing fast than anything else, and the slower material just can't be as convincing. Be that as it may, this is considered by many to be the last great Slayer album and is a fine addition to anybody's metal library.
B000059XY5|4.0|Deep Satire, haunting personal ethos, desperate souls...The Dark Knight returns, or arrives for the first time rather?... Michael Keaton, of whom the silent majority believe to be the most convincing and well acted Batman/Bruce Wayne, delivers a stoic performance that seems to become more gratifying a second or third stroll through Gotham City. Although he battles 2 arch enemies in this film, there is really a third, Max Schreck. Played to steely perfection by Christopher Walken, as quoted referring to Selena Kyle, &quot;Bottom line. If she tries to blackmail me, I'll drop her out of a higher window.&quot; The Catwoman represents female repression and complete anger towards weak female characterization in film or real life. Both the Catwoman and Batman seem anchored to fear in a struggle to reconcile there desire to allow both sides of their personalities to exist in harmony. And thus a connection is made on both fronts...However, where Bruce Wayne is held at bay by Alfred the loyal butler and friend, Ms. Kyle has no one and her sanity slowly drifts out to sea. The Penguin, discarded at birth for being born &quot;a little different,&quot; is used in effect to create sympathy within Bruce Wayne, whom has lived through parental tragedy as well. Both Penguin and Catwoman have very similar dark emotions as Batman. Which in the end is fabulous, because Batman makes no direct attempt to kill either character. He knows himself, and thusly knows that their own misgivings will create their own deaths...Although Catwoman has a few to spare I'm sure...Some people didn't like Batman Returns because it spawned sequels that needed more than one enemy...It must be said that in Batman Returns, Bruce Wayne's greatest fear was learning to deal with himself, making the ultimate sacrifice for his own humanity. A triumph in character development, satire of human relationships, and of freeing desperate souls.  ..Not to mention the last good Batman movie, and one of Burton's best and mostpersonal works:: ranks up their with his &quot;Ed Wood(1994)&quot; &amp; Edward SciccorHands(1990)&quot;<br />Rating: 4 out of 5<br />Grade: B+ 90%
B000002H97|3.0|All right, I will attempt to review this album without any respect to whether they &quot;sold out&quot;. This is a good, not quite spectacular record which, on the basis of a few stunning singles, became extremely popular. The strong tracks on here - like 'Sad But True', 'Unforgiven' and of course 'Enter Sandman' - are very effective attempts at slowing and simplifying the basic thrash template. It was on the basis of those, plus the melodic ballad 'Nothing Else Matters', that the Black Album captured the hearts and minds of young metal listeners everywhere. The rest of the disc is so-so. Much of it, particularly 'Don't Tread on Me' and 'My Friend of Misery', sounds like the sort of generic hard rock filler that became prevalent on their later releases. Taken as a whole, TBA can't top the epic majesty of their earlier works. It's still a decent piece of work though.
B00005B7CK|3.0|Just like the Cohen Brother's last effort, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; suffers from the fact that it's wonderfully done with a vast amount of flair, but suffer's from an otherwise &quot;uneven&quot; story-structure, and rather pointless non-potent social commentary. Very well crafted and very well directed, it's an enjoyable experience, if not  a hilarious one at that. The perfomances are great, with John Goodman and Geroge Clooney coming out on top, not for all tastes, &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; is pure Cohen Brothers, and some of it's subject matter might upset a marginal pair audience. The films photgraphy is beautifully done as well, with it's symbolic browns and greens crused into one frame. It may not be in the Same League as their &quot;Blood Simple(1986) or &quot;Fargo(1994)&quot;...but serves as a good companion piece to their second string &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, both films that center around a pair of misfits who find themselves in the most non-ambiguous of situations.<br />Rating: 31/2 out of 5<br />Grade: B 86%
B000000OSE|3.0|i think that slash must listen to some kiss work before he picks up a guitar again , this band is not for rock lovers all of ya should search for psycho circus , thats the good stuff (kiss rocks)

B00005LMBK|5.0|I have to agree with &quot;mikah tequila&quot; (another reviewer) -- if it weren't for mtv (which I have now watched all of once) and the fact that the cartoon video caught my eye, I never would have heard of the gorillaz, and I am very glad that I have.  This album kicks  and has something for everyone.  It combines rock, rap, hip-hop, reggae and everything in between.  Buy it now, and happy listening (and, as is the case, happy website viewing).  :)

0553106635|5.0|I enjoy this book very much.  It was one of the very first fantasy series I read.  It has so much depth and keeps you within its grasp all the way to the end.  I'll have a hard time waiting for the next book.
B00004XQ83|5.0|...this is wonderful collection of old-time songs, masterfully produced by T-Bone Burnett and performed with full-throated splendor by a bunch of people I never heard of. The truth is, I was never a huge fan of folk or country or bluegrass music -- until I saw this movie and fell in love with the songs I heard.<br />The music was integral to the film and not only is the CD delicious listening for its own sake, but it calls to mind great scenes from the movie. The accompanying booklet discusses the style of music used, the artists involved, and the film's connection to the mythic Odyssey and southern culture.<br />I had already ordered this CD when I read the review warning people about the sonic distortion, but that reviewer was mistaken .... there is no distortion on this CD, either on direct listening or on conversion to mp3 files.  The songs sound fine.<br />A real treat -- and NO distortion!

B00003CXRM|5.0|I would rank this film as one of the Coen Brothers' best.  The premise (of relating Homer's Odyssey as the 1937 story of an escaped convict's journey to prevent his ex-wife from remarrying) is interesting, the dialogue is clever throughout, the cast is wonderful, and the music adds immeasurably to the entertainment.<br />Of special note, the Coens have been exceedingly generous in the extras offered to those who see the DVD.  A behind-the-scenes presentation features interviews and observations from the brothers as well as major actors and technical people; a music video of the breakaway single &quot;A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;; a documentary about the unique digital colorization techniques used for the film; and (my favorite) three scenes which can be run as a simulcast of the film with storyboard panels.  The cinematography and sets are beautiful.<br />This is what a DVD package *should* be!  If you like the Coen Brothers' previous work you should love this.  If you are interested in film as a creative endeavor, you will probably enjoy the film and the informative and fun extras.  If you like comedy and good music, it would be worth your while to take a chance on this very enjoyable film.
B00005K3LU|5.0|With it Willis became an international star, McTiernan the foremost action director of the age, and it has been infinitely copied. But the movie itself if very original and perhaps the best action film ever made. Why? Unlike most action films, this movie spends lots of time developing its characters and the plot. It creates people we care about. The acting is outstanding. I cannot think of one bad performance in the entire movie. The scene-stealer is Rickman, who gained his stardom from this film (and has been typecast forever as a villain). It does all this while being the most heart-pounding film of the century, and the directing is incredible, by the way. There is substance here, not just style. If you watch it enough times, you will realize the true genius of this production. McClane and Gruber become not only metaphoric of good and evil, but also of the struggle of the human spirit.
B000059HAI|4.0|Before the Ben Affleck flick, I was telling my friends that &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; would give them a better view of whatever happened in the day which &quot;will live in infamy&quot;.  In fact, I made them see the film and the reaction was extremely mixed.  Some of them prefered the romantic approach that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was presenting, especially girls.  But, what the hell...?<br />&quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, as far as I know, is the only film that presents the points of view of both the American and the Japanese, and that gives the film the accurate scent of what happened on December 7th, 1941.  The cast is truly remarkable.  The effects are quite good, with no computer graphics.  And let's not forget the music by Jerry Goldsmith, which is the best thing here in the movie.<br />I'm not particularly pleased with the extras, however.  The historians who talk about the attack give a very interesting inside scoop on the facts surrounding Pearl Harbor, but I would have loved to see some interviews with the surviving cast and crew members of this movie, as well as an isolated track of Goldsmith's music.  But you can't get all what you want.  Right?
B000059H99|5.0|This Oscar-winning look at the rags-to-riches motif still holds up today. This story is parallel to Stallone's: The first film was the start of a long and profitable career, the Rocky movies got cornier and cornier (II was OK, III had Mr. T. Enough said. IV had that big Russian guy, a corny ending, and was all-around sappy. V was embarassing. Let's hope VI never gets out of the gate), just like Stallone's movies, and although both series did well at the box office, both were fading artistically and critically. But anyway, this movie is teriffic. Stallone is Rocky Balboa, Carl Weathers is his nemesis, Apollo Creed, and they must face off, because only one can be the champion. Rocky never gives up, even when the odds are a million to one, and the energy from this picture is truly incredible. As some have said, its impossible not to like, and with good reason. Worth buying, but ignore the contrived sequels.
6305910103|4.0|...Graphics works were superb (and still hold up well today), although some of the star glows in the nebula were fake-looking.  My only real problem with this DVD release is the lack of the extra footage...All in all, this is an excellent movie to start on if you are just getting into the series.
B00005K3LW|3.0|This movie had the best line I have ever heard in a trailer. Just imagine that gravelly, cold voice saying, &quot;On a good day, he's a great cop. On a bad day, he's the best there ever was.&quot; Yes! I saw the movie just for that line.<br />The Die Hard people did the right thing by bringing back John McTiernan for the third installment. However, this movie never clicks like the first film did. It never becomes as heart-pounding, isn't as strong as far as plot is concerned, it just doesn't have that intangible magic. That doesn't mean it is not enjoyable. Willis is at his wisecracking best, Jackson is good, Irons is a wonderful villain (but can't hope to compare to Hans Gruber). There are some good sequences here. Take a look, but it doesn't stand the scrutiny like the first one.
6305546789|4.0|On Halloween night,1963, Michael Myers had brutuly and  savagely murdered his older sister, Judith, and now, 15 years later, Myers has escaped, and Dr. Samuel Loomis, Myers' doctor, must  capture him before he goes on a killing rampage. Myers returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, where he meets Laurie Strode, a young teenager. Myers gets obsessed with Laurie, and unknowable to her, Myers has only one thing on his mind...Pure Evil. Great suspense with well-fitted music, good screenplay, and great acting. Though I think Laurie could've been a bit more smarter then how she is =0 (Leaving that knife in the floor was the stupidest thing you could've done, no offense.)...other than that, she's a great heroine. This movie is probably one of the best and most famous horror movies ever made. It has the popularity and publicity a horror movie like this so highly deserves. And since Halloween is almost around the corner, it's a good thing to plan to watch this movie with popcorn, soda, and candy this Halloween night with your friends and family-I guarantee it'll be a blast!
6300146014|5.0|Besides the performance of Richard Burton, this film contains Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, and Vanessa Redgrave. The opulent sets, intellectual script, and the music make this an excellent if overlooked &quot;classic.&quot;
B000031WD9|4.0|I saw the movie in theaters and liked it and decided to get the DVD (Unrated version). As much as I can remember, it's the same exact movie from the rated version, nothing more than a marketing scheme, however its still a good movie and if you do decide to get it, get the Ultimate Version, it has 2 DVDs instead of one and apparently more of the bed room scene although it is just another marketing scheme but at least this time they actually put some effort into it.
B00003Q438|3.0|This is a great film, however, being the owner of a widescreen television, it's a shame the DVD sharpness is lost.  <br />I brought the DVD assuming it would be &quot;formated for widescreen tv&quot; (it does says exactly that on the bottom of the DVD box.  Yet it is not really anamorphic.  For those of you who don't know what anamorphic means, you will once you invest some money on a widescreen television.  Trust me...it's worth waiting for an anamorphic DVD version. Any movie I buy must say anamorphic(or made for 16x9 televisions).   If you don't have a 16x9 tv yet, but plan to buy one in the next few years, I recommend you start building your DVD collection with only anamorphic enhanced DVD's.<br />I'm so upset that I can't maximize my Abyss DVD.  I'm even more upset they still haven't come out with the anamorphic version.  The Abyss movie is so good I refuse to watch it at a lesser quality.
B00005LMBK|4.0|A friend handed me his copy and told me to listen to &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; with the explanation that this group is really different, but that he thought I'd like it.  HE WAS SO RIGHT!  The music is very funky with cool rhythms that you'll find yourself getting lost in.  The CD's not short, but you'll think it is because the music is just that seamless.<br />If you've read other reviews of mine, then you know I'm a fan of Groove Armada, and Gorillaz strikes me as being in about the same category.  Of my favorites on this CD:  Clint Eastwood (of course), Sound Check, and Slow Country.  This CD would be great when you just don't know what you feel like listening to because while the songs flow together so well and sail from one to the other like it was all one big track, they do have separate personalities.<br />Very cool music indeed, give this one a try.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Britney can dance, but shes not much at picking out someone to mix her CD's. This new CD is over mixed and all the songs have the EXACT same beat, even the slow songs. The only good songs on the CD have already been released and are all over MTV. She can dance, got to give her that. But next time Britney, have someone else mix the album.
0790731452|5.0|Don't read too much into this film.  It just is what it is.  But; take a look at that cast list! This movie is fun, and don't think that it should be more then that.  Makes a great movie night when shown with ID4.  A key movie for any burton fan.
0399146253|2.0|I really enjoy reading a series of books from the same author--in fact I don't even mind the same 'type' of writing or story lines that murder mystery series novels most likely contain.  BUT I do mind buying a book and feeling like I am reading the previous book in the series.  The Last Precinct's story line is such a continuation of the previous book's werewolf theme and &quot;Is Benton really dead??&quot; storyline that I was bored and unchallenged while reading the majority of the book.  The final chapters pick up a bit--and that is only b/c FINALLY some new material/characters come into the storyline.<br />Patricia Cornwell can write much more interesting material--this must have been a very hard sell because as my title suggests--same story/book-different title!
B000002UB3|5.0|This album is the climax to the Beatle's whole musical career together. Nonsensical and wonderful.
0060934913|4.0|\\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is a lively, entertaining book written by a man who for well over twenty years has loved his life as a chef.  It's a fast-paced, demanding, all-consuming job of long hours spent preparing and cooking food in hot, crowded restaurant kitchens.  It involves dealing with food purveyors and \\"pirate crews\\" of food preparers, \\"waitrons\\", and other types of restaurant staff.<br /><br />Anthony Bourdain, who is a rangy 6'4\\"', clearly loves to eat; he  all aspects of the chef's work, from selecting food to cooking and presenting it. His enthusiasm may re-kindle kitchen inspiration in women like me, who have been responsible for putting family meals on the table for decades.<br /><br /> He reveals some behind-the-scenes secrets, like why it's not advisable to order seafood on a Monday, and of what those \\"brunches\\" may really consist---aging leftovers, concealed in viniagrette or pasta salad or other mixed dishes.<br /><br />He writes insouciantly of the frequent chaos in the kitchen, of drinking and drugging, of foul-mouthed and undependable co-workers, of rats who feast on avocados left out to ripen.  His light-hearted touch may cause you to smile, but here's a caveat:  This is not a book to read directly before you leave for a festive restaurant meal.
B000001EQT|4.0|Took me a bit to appreciate this one, after falling in love with FUTURISTIC DRAGON and ELECTRIC WARRIOR. But I eventually did, and still dig it.
0451203933|4.0|Mark Bowden does an excellent job in portraying the Battle of THe Black Sea to its fullest extent.  The graphically descriptive images of the battle and the emotions that plagued those involved were realistically displayed.  It is definitely a book destined for great reviews.  The only minor drawback is the constant fluctuations between different characters' point of views and the chronology of the events.  THough noted that such technique could be aiming for the true confusion that these Rangers and Delta Operators were plagued with, but it would be much easier on the readers if it was clearer.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I don't think so. Don't be deterred by the long running time, it grabs you and doesn't let go, and the last word to use in describing this film is &quot;boring&quot;.<br />Death comes to call, in the form of smoldering Brad Pitt, on the wise and affluent media mogul Bill Parrish, played by an always-brilliant Anthony Hopkins. If the movie were entirely about their relationship, which goes from hatred and denial to warm humor and father/son almost constantly, it would be enough. For a little extra, however, we're given the charming and stunning Claire Forlani as the compassionate doctor who falls in the love with Death, under the guise of Joe Black (Pitt). The catch: he's in love with her as well, and she's the daughter of Bill, the man who's destined to leave with Death when he tires of live as a man. Cooperate politics, romance, sex, and witty thoughts on life and death complete this fabulous flim, rounding it out into perfection.<br />Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Bill, conveying every emotion you'd except with absolute genious, and even a suprising touch of warmth and compassion when it comes to his new friend, Death. He steals the show without actually stealing it, leaving plenty of room for Forlani and Pitt to have a complex and intriguing relationship. There are no good guys and bad guys - if there were, you would leave the theater hating Brad Pitt for what he represtents. You simply don't. A movie that's so easy to fall in love with, without being &quot;too perfect&quot; or sickeningly sweet. In fact, it's rather the opposite, revealing our flaws and imperfections along with all the passion and beauty.
B000002MUW|2.0|I don't know what I was expecting when I took this CD off the shelf. But this CD was definetly not it. What this record lacks is a really good fast song. The ballads go on and on, most of them love songs that get repitive and old. Here is where you will long for the girl power attitude of her earlier albums like Like a Prayer and True Blue. Only three songs on this album I would even think of calling them *dance songs*, Don't Stop, Survival, and Human Nature. However, these three were awesome and I found my feet tapping to the beat. But they can't compare to earlier songs like Borderline and Till Death Do Us Part.  On the flip side however, the songs were well written and if your a fan of endless love ballads, I would reccomend this CD.
B00000K31Q|4.0|Although a step-up from the usual mediocre teen flick genre, '10 Things' doesn't *quite* escape that label altogether. The script is very witty, even to the point of being really good, but the developement of its characters is sadly lacking. Heath Ledger's character, Patrick Verona (the male lead), goes too easily from &quot;tough and scary&quot; to &quot;sweet and sensitive&quot;, without anything to make us believe it. Since the dialogue shows no evidence of his being in love with Kat (Julia Stiles) until he comes out and says it, it's rather hard to believe. Juliat Stiles character has a similiar problem, going from &quot;grumpy loner&quot; to &quot;happy teen&quot; in hardly a blink. Of course, one hardly notices due to these young actors supurb preformances.<br />The co-stars steal the show, however. The bumbling new kid who falls for the sweet and popular, if a little shallow, Bianca (Kat's sister) is so likable I wish the story focused on him and all his troubles, and his quirky new friend has some great lines. Allison Janey is wonderful and often provides great comic relief among some flat jokes.<br />A great movie, worth watching more then once. But not an exellent movie that will go down in history as a classic.
0767802519|3.0|This film has become a huge cult classic since its release in 1994 but I am sorry to say (for those who love it) that I am not a part of that cult. Although the film is at moments very thrilling and very interesting it does have fatal flaws and elements to its story that bring the whole thing down. Is it a good action film? Yes. Is it worth seeing? Yes. Does it deserve the four and five star reviews? No.<br />The main flaw is the age of Natalie Portman and her character. I assume that most got past this but I myself could not wrap myself could wrap my mind around a twelve-year-old doing these things. This thought was always in the back of my head as I viewed this film and it was a flaw that brought the movie down. Portman was excellent but she should have been a few years older. Her age doesn't ruin the movie it merely lowers its impact and credibility.<br />Jean Reno's performance is the highlight of the film and the film is worth seeing for him alone. He really makes this cold, hard killer he plays human and the scenes between Portman and him are great if only for the nervousness in the air between the two created by Reno. Every time he spits his milk is a classic moment. Gary Oldman's performance as the crooked cop is at times good but most of the time it borders dangerously close to overacting and this is crippling to his character. It is hard to get a reading off of him.<br />Luc Besson's directing is very good with many exciting action scenes (although some veer a little too close to cheesy) and neat little bits of camera work such as the very beginning stuff and the final battle. He has an obvious sense of story and I believe the film is exactly as he wanted it. I have not seen \\"La Femme Nikita\\" or the international version of this film but I hope to soon.<br />So all in all the film is good but with a few major flaws that are always in the back of your mind and bring down the films impact. It is not worth four or five star but I would give it a good three and a half stars for sure. Definitely give it a try and see for yourself<br />Thanxs...nd a half stars for sure. Definitely give it a try and see for yourself<br />Thanxs...
B00003CX5P|2.0|[....]Like many others that have written reviews, I am totally disappointed with Episode I.  The problems in a nutshell: (1) too many plot lines, especially throw-away plots that barely tie into the chief plot (i.e. the phantom menace--the Trade Federation overshadowing the plotting Palpatine); (2) Horrible dialogue (like others have stated, the actors were given some of the most inane lines in recent blockbuster history--e.g. \\"Now that's pod racing,\\" exclaims young Annie as he *accidentally* destroys thousands of \\"enemy\\" alien beings and robots on the Trade Federation ship); (3) Even more horrible directing. Let's face facts now: George Lucas comes up with imaginative characters, settings, plot lines, etc.  He is a story teller.  He is not, however, a screenwriter or director--or more appropriately, he fails at such attempts.  Most viewers agree that Star Wars [...] is a basic yet solid movie, with decent acting and spectacular effects.  The mystical force drew us audience members in and kept us waiting for Empire and Jedi.  A better moview with a stronger plot, Empire Strikes Back has superb directing and screenwriting (NOTE: Lucas did NOT write the screenplay NOR did he direct).  Compare scenes such as the lightsaber dual with any other.  The intensity and emotion poured out in those few minutes is unrivaled--even by the excellent and artistic choreography of the Darth Maul/Qui Gon Jinn/Obi Wan battle.  Some of us still get shivers watching Darth Vader reveal his identity to Luke, shortly after he lobs off his son's hand.  ANOTHER NOTE: Ewan McGregor's onscreen acting took place only when Darth Maul kills Qui Gon--and that is not the actor's fault, but the writer/director's!<br />The director of Empire captured pure emotion in shots of faces without any dialogue.  Just view the \\"carbonite freezing\\" scene, with individual shots of Leia, Han, Vader, Boba Fett, Chewbacca, etc.  The pure emotion that the director attempted in the shots really worked!  Furthermore, the director was not afraid to get the actors/characters dirty.  Luke is a sweaty, torn, and bleading frazzle at the end of Empire; compare with the well groomed while battling scenes of Return of the Jedi and Phantom.  <br />Empire Strikes Back is revered as the best Star Wars movie overall because of the following: only TWO major plots (One major, one minor) dominate the movie.  Luke remains the focus, the force is discussed [...], the maturation of Luke is observed throughout.<br />The Phantom Menace is an example of a good intentions and good plot line gone awry.  Palpatine is barely in the movie, and Maul makes a memorable appearance for a fight, but their few lines (three sentences for Maul?) and appearances are so overshadowed by TOTALLY UNNECESSARY SCENES including the \\"spectacular\\" (sarcasm) Pod Race.  Here's an idea for a movie: have the title match up with the chief plot.<br />Here are some more unbelievably bad points of the Phantom Menace: 1. actor and character lines for Anakin Skywalker.  Couldn't be more boring (though cute) and canned.  With all of that aside, the boy is a cute kid.  I had to laugh when Yoda says, \\"there is much fear in you.\\"  Both the audience AND Anakin are thinking the same thing.  \\"What [...]are you talking about, Yoda?!  The only emotion I have is for a fast sports car . . . er, pod racer.\\"  NOTE: Anakin left his mom in a matter of minutes from being released and he sure didn't show fear.  [...] he was fearLESS!  (In this case, that meant he didn't care or think about what he was getting into, but that's another issue.) 2. Waisted talent: Liam, Ewan, and Natalie are sure wasted on this show.  Sadly, they obviously followed the director's tips.  BEST ACTING IN SHOW: Natalie Portman--she's the only one that snuck in a bit of emotion to her lines.<br />3. Bizarre surprises: (a) virgin birth of Anakin, (b) force is actually not an energy field but microscopic organisms, (c) Obi Wan was not actually trained by Yoda, but Qui Gon, (d) Jedis are a bunch of ignorant and dismissive elitists, (e) everybody in Star Wars is related somehow--even C3PO was--this is absurd--made by Anakin.  No, he couldn't have been a translator for any number of characters; indeed, Luke's very father, in childhood, built a the gold-plated British twit that came to meet Luke, on the same planet (Tatooine) where he was born/created--even though C3PO has no idea where the hell he is in Star Wars (episode one).  Need I say more?
B00005AWMF|5.0|Even though she is not my favorite artist, SAde can do no wrong. When it comes to this &quot;Best of&quot; collection, it truly is the best of the greatest hits that I have in my collection, and I have quite a few.<br />Sade proves that not only she stood the test of time but that she's smooth and talented.<br />If you don't own anything of Sade, this is a must have. Perfect for those romantic nights or when you just want to lay back and relax.
B000003S5H|5.0|Although this album has been out for a while, there is no reason why you shouldn't own it and pretend that you are on the cutting edge of music.  Air's silky synthesizer tunes and complex compositions require you to relax and submit to their music.  This one of the most complete albums ever: the transitions are well-orchestrated and the songs are varied enough to prevent boredom .  La Femme D'Argent, Talisman, and Ce Matin La are amongst the all time great instumentals, and All I Need and You Make It Easy take their places amongst the tenderest vocal songs.  The only criticism I can think of is the placement of Sexy Boy as the second song, where it doesn't really seem to fit and interrupts the mood set by La Femme D'Argent.  If you are looking to expand your musical horizons, choose this CD.
B00000ILDE|5.0|In 1979 they created a movie that stunned people and changed the way we looked at space.  It was a different type of Science Fiction  it had alot of elements of horror.  Seven years later in 1986, director James Cameron (Terminator, Terminator 2, The Abyss) created its sequal which not only was as good as the first but better.  Different from the original this one has Sigourney Weaver playin the part or Ripley again, but she has come out of a 57 year hyper sleep and finds out they have colonized the planet in which she picked up the origianl alien.  Son afterwards they loose contact with the colonies and have to send in Ripley and a marine team to search for the eopl and destroy what they find.  Which turns out to much more then one alien.  Great movie with superb casting.
B000055ZB8|5.0|The new edition of the restored NOSFERATU is even more improved than the former version. The new transfer is far more crisper, sharper, allows us to explore the visual sensibilities of Murnau's beautifully worked out compositions, the subtle nuances lights and shadows. The intertitles' design is more elaborated and enhance the film's gothic, haunting, yet inteligent and authentic feeling; taking form of a historical record of &quot;the great death of Wisborg in 1843&quot;. The Timothy Howard organ score seemed to me perfect for the film, but the new modern score by the Silent Orchestra is also very interesting in exloring another dimention of Murnau's vison of &quot;a symphony of horror&quot;. While the organ score enhance the classic horror aspect of fear, the new score freely explores the psychological dimentions of the story, of sex, desire, and frustratrions. Both tracks are on this DVD. The new special features includes series of comparions of the film's scenes and photos of the locations as they look today, guided by Lokke Haas, who also provides an insightful audio commentary (which was already on the former edition). With the new transfer, ofcourse one would see that most of this &quot;German Expressionist&quot; classic was actually, mostly shot on location... Well, now we can compare it with how the actual places look like. No need to say, NOSFERATU is the first film adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel DRACULA, and today still remains the best, and probably even the most modern cinematic vision to this apocalyptic tale. Frankly, the dashing gentleman-vampyre as portrayed by Bela Lugosi et all is not scary at all to contemporary eyes, while Max Schreck's incredible performance as the blood-sucking count, weak at the first sight, victim of his own desire, touches something underneath our mind, the subcontious nerve of fear within us. It may be the dark-side portrayal of our sexy human desire...
0767805712|5.0|I often call this movie an allegory when talking about it with my friends. Critics often point out that this movie is obviously unrealistic, but I don't think the producers were trying to create a realistic future. Much Science-Fiction is written as a warning against society in preventing it from making errors that could later on destroy the human race. This movie, although showing the horror of genetically created humans, is not meant to warn us against genetic engineering, rather, the moral of this movie is how an individual can overcome the longest odds possible and still succeed.<br />Ethan Hawke plays a naturally conceived (i.e. not genetically engineered) young man that has dreams of going into space. In the futuristic setting of this movie, spacemen travel at least as far as to the moons of Jupiter, but only if they can pass mental, physical and intellectual tests that only genetically engineered men can pass. However Ethan Hawke is not discouraged and risks everything he has to get into the space travel program.<br />This movie is free from the morose cynicism of most movies today. If you'd like to see a movie where you can walk out with a smile on your face, this is it.
0671027344|3.0|This is a great book to read if you've ever been in the unfortunate position of beginning high school (or college, or a new job) where you had no friends and were a little freaked out about it.  In Charlie, Stephen Chbosky has created a kind of modern Everyman in that I everyone can relate to at least one of the experiences in the book.  The only problem I have is the ending--it's almost like Stephen Chbosky outlined all the plot points before he started writing, got tired of writing after 100 or so pages, and crammed the rest of the story into a final &quot;chapter&quot; (or, in the case of this book, letter).<br />This is, for the most part, an extremely well written book--one of the truest adolescent voices I've seen in literature.  It is engaging and difficult to put down.  I just wish Chbosky hadn't waited until so near the end to drop so many bombshells.
B000002C2E|5.0|This album, along with some older albums is what got me into listening to Dylan. It is an essential complement to the albums of the 60s and 70s for which Dylan is so famous. When this album came out in the fall of 1997, it was a refreshing change for critics and fans. Dylan's albums since he became a born-again Christian in the late 70s were not well received in the mainstream and many thought he lost touch with his 60s roots. He toured with the Grateful Dead, Tom Petty in the 80s and started to regain his following, but the albums didn't sell that well. To make a long story short, an album of this caliber has been long awaited by fans and critics.<br />Time Out of Mind was extraordinary deep and at times even dark. Many of the songs deal with torn relationships. Dylan sounds like an impartial observer watching the events around him on songs like &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; and especially &quot;Highlands&quot;. It gives a new insight into his reclusive lifestyle.<br />I gave this album five stars because I believe it is essential to any music library. Its the type of album that you can pick up in a few years and will still be meaningful.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I HAVE TO SAY I LOVE THIS MOVIE. ITS SO BROUGHT TO LIFE WITH THE BEAUTIFUL SCENERY, TERRIFYING MOMENTS, SUPERB ACTING ONLY TOM HANKS COULD BRING, AND A LOVE STORY THATS REALLY SAD BUT TOUCHES THE HEART.

B000056K04|4.0|I have been an avid Dave fan since I was only 8 years old, and I disagree with most of the avid Dave fans. (or at least those who claim to be.) Though I don't find this CD to be even close to their finest work, I think the change has brought out a new side of the band.  Dave on electric wasn't bad, and the addition of Ballard ended out making a pretty good CD.  I'm not saying I loved this CD, and I'm DEFINITELY not saying that ditching Lillywhite was a good idea.  I simply respect the band's decision, though I don't agree with it, and listen to the CD for what it is: MUSIC.  I liked the soothing sounds of Space Between and the Phantom-of-the-Opera-ish What You Are.  This CD is not their best, and in fact, might be their worst, but that is not because it's a bad CD.  It's because all of their other CDs are so good.  When Crash, Under the Table and Dreaming, and Live at Luther College are your standards, how can you expect every CD to match up?
0783225903|2.0|having a love affair with it.  The acting is good, the images (for 1980's standards) are fun to watch and the story is worth being told.  What's pitiful is the writing, direction and editing.  These three things, especially the writing, make the movie very difficult to watch.  Character development and motivation is kept to a minimum, and instead we are typically rushed into another fantasy sequence or great set design that sometimes makes a curious commentary, but usually has nothing to do with the story.<br />If you have high standards for a movie, Brazil is a disaster.  A few good parts don't usually make a movie good.  A few bad ones (especially when its writing and editing) can ruin a movie.  It's not bad to use a little discretion in film making, but Terry Gilliam threw everything at the screen and virtually none of it sticks.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|You either love it or you hate it.<br />I loved it.<br />From the opening frame to the very end. This film is packed with surprises. Wasn't really too keen on watching it and just did so cuz my friends met up with me. But when the Fox logo shows in tin-type with a &quot;Sound of Music&quot; incidental music, I realized I was up for a treat!<br />I'm not a fan of MTV but I must say, I enjoyed this one with its quick cuts, angles,  and all. Just don't sit too close to the screen or you could get a headache. Or a nosebleed. The colors! the angles, the quick cuts. Wild!<br />The songs just sneak up on you and you can't help but giggle or let out a guffaw. It's really quite clever. Haven't had this much fun in years. In fact, don't remember ever watching a musical in the movie house that was this fun! It feels like a broadway play. But the songs are not only memorable, you actually remember hearing them before! Evita the movie, I didn't enjoy too much. This one I liked.<br />Being a singer myself (modesty aside), Ewan M.'s singing isn't the most accomplished, but I must say, it worked really well with the material. He really conveyed his emotions well into the songs, with a clear, easy-to-listen-to voice. I know I actually can sing better, but I was so caught up in it, I actually found myself wishing I could sing as well as he did! And to be in love like him!<br />As for Nicole, all I can say is Tom Cruise is a dud! I absolutely fell in love with her. She will remain a Major Star without him! Absolutely luminous, you can tell why all of Paris was falling for her character. I can see what different generations could see in Ana Held, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna. But she can stand up to them anytime. In fact, she pays homage to them in this film.Not a real singer, but lovely to listen to and look at. I really wanted to be Ewan McGregor! And I wanted to be singing up the clouds in Paris on top of an Elephant!<br />And watch out for Kylie Minogue's cameo as a fairy. I'm not a fan, but I noticed her. Very clever.<br />This film plays like a Filipino movie. It has comedy, drama, action, tears, zanyness, no logic, music, fun. But this one works.<br />I've recommended this film to not a few friends only to be retorted with &quot;Really? My friend said it sucked!&quot;<br />A warning to the uncultured, unintelligent, unwitty, unimaginative, and unromantic: You may actully think this film sucks!<br />My mom goes to the movies only once every few years. I think she watched Ghost, Beauty and the Beast, Titanic, and this one. But she was absolutely entertained!<br />Can't wait for the DVD and I really hope it has a director's commentary, an isolated score, and the making., but I noticed her.

B00000K0DT|1.0|I'm equally dumbfounded at the love flowing from so many reviewers of this movie.  <br />If you've seen a lot of the old Twilight Zone TV shows or countless other suspense/mystery movies or shows, you'll see this movie's &quot;surprise&quot; ending coming before you put it in the DVD player (or VCR).  Unbelievably pathetic and flimsy ending that will catch most simians by surprise negates the entire film (for those of you who think this movie is brilliant, that means the ending just means the entire movie didn't really exist).  In fact, the inconsistencies through Kevin Spacey's character's dialogue(as pointed out by other reviewers) give the entire ending away, but only to those viewers who are paying attention and aren't easily duped.<br />Writing is pitiful, acting is good, direction is laborious and editing is unobtrusive.  That's the most complimentary thing I can write.  The false crime story that's played out is a typical run of the mill crime story and isn't engaging.  <br />The hype machine for this film is unnecessarily spinning out of control and I pity the poor souls who get caught up in it.  If you want to be popular at cocktail parties, act like you think this movie is a masterpiece, and do nothing but talk about this movie's ending (which is all I've ever heard anyone discuss about this film).  If you have brain, you'll realize that this film offers nothing new and merely recycles stories and plot devices from much better movies and tv shows.
6305499365|5.0|This is the first successful attempt to bring out the culture of corporate america. .... Office Space accurately portrays the injustice, ineficiency, hypocrisy, and lack of common sense that plagues big companies. .... .... The movie also shows how management seems to ignore obvious irresponsible behavior of some while focusing on others who commit relatively small faults  .... The movie shows the obvious and we laugh, but wouldn't be great if corporate cnsultants used this movie as a training tool -FOR MANAGEMENT- of what NOT TO DO!  May be this is the begining of the end of hypocrisy. Good job Mike Judge! Please make a sequel.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is simply amazing.  This is truly a CD that I listen to all the way through whenever i pop it in.  It sparkles with a mixture of poppy rockers, &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;Wait&quot; and &quot;You Wont See Me&quot;, lashing tongue-in-cheek compositions, &quot;I'm looking through you&quot; and &quot;Run For Your Life&quot;, folksy knee-thumping tunes, &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and &quot;What Goes On&quot;, and affirming and insightful message songs, &quot;Norwhere Man&quot;, &quot;Think for Yourself&quot;, and &quot;The Word&quot;.  &quot;Girl&quot; by John Lennon is the Beatles biggest masterpiece up to this point to me, it resonates with a sad, pleading, and mournful texture all within the constraints of a catchy pop tune.  NO ONE was making music like this at that time in 1965.  The real beauty of this album is that it mixes the Beatles youthful exuberance with very deep and adult themes to produce a beatiful, introspective, and above all life-affirming sound.  Very highly recommended.
B000002TPS|1.0|Rust in Peace was a brilliant album.  Countdown to Extinction was a great album.  This one is just water.  No balls.  No energy.  The songwriting is weak (with the exception of Train of Consequences, which I think is okay) The album production is cheesey.  After this one was released I lost interest in Megadeth.
B00000JGEI|5.0|For some people, this might be kind of hard to understand but the original is a better movie, but I enjoy this one more. The first one is better quality, with a fresher plot, but from a guy's point of view, it has more action, and possibly better special effects than the Matrix. I reccomend renting this movie first, because if your reading these reviews, you've obviously never seen it.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Critical praise or damnation aside, Forrest Gump, simply, should be seen by all people who really love \\"Hollywood\\" films.  What do I mean?  Well, Hollywood has a knack for making empty films that say nothing and mean nothing.  However, every so often, they get it right AND the films wins Best Picture.  <br />I can think of only two other Best Picture examples that compare to Forrest Gump in their appeal, their scope, their grandeur, their humor, their characters, and their place in Hollywood...Gone With The Wind and All About Eve.  Why?  <br />Because each focused on a central character whose existence both set and altered the course of all those they encountered.  I am no true fan of the very one-note Tom Hanks, but, his face is one of the sweetest images ever captured on film as Forrest Gump.  It is remarkable, truly.  <br />The supporting cast is no less than perfect, however, the best supporting act in this film has been largely overlooked.  Alan Silvestri's score.  Listen to his suite as it appears on the double cd soundtrack.  Magnificent.  I defy anyone to listen to that on loud, and not be moved or inspired.  In fact, the Academy, finally understanding the importance of music and that comedy films and dramatic films cannot possibly compete against each other, divided the Original Score category the following year.  However, it was one year too late, as Forrest Gump's score lost to the bland and generic Lion King score.<br />If you have seen Forrest Gump and loved it, you already know what I mean.  If you haven't seen Forrest Gump, you must only see it on DVD or Letterboxed VHS.  YOU CANNOT SEE A CROPPED VERSION!  I hope, for your sake, you enjoy it.
B00000JZI9|5.0|I love Western movies. Especially John Wayne Westerns. &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;, &quot;Hondo&quot;, &quot;True Grit&quot;, &quot;The Searchers&quot;, and more. I first watched this movie at my uncle's house, thinking that because it was a more modern movie, I wouldn't really like it that much. And let me tell you something. I was watching it, mesmerized for the whole 132 minutes of it! It was superb! <br />It's a typical western story. There's the good guys who fight for justice, and the bad guys, who are greedy, selfish, and cruel. But the story line and plot was good, centering on the four main actors, Kevin Kline (Paden), Scott Glenn (Emmett), Danny Glover (Mal), and Kevin Costner (Jake). The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat. The ending is such a good one, too. <br />As soon as I could, I bought this DVD and I don't regret it. You can watch this movie so many times and you still won't get tired of it. The DVD has lots of special features. I loved watching the &quot;Making of Silverado&quot; documentary, learned a lot about the movie. I love the production notes. This is a movie you can't miss!!
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Well what can I say-we're all 15 years older, a little bit less hair. But the passion and the fire are still there. Ver Maiden are back with an album which in my opinion ranks at the same level of 7th Son. It is rawer (3 guitars) than that particular one, but it maintains Maiden's winning point- melody. If you like the 80's albums, you'll like this, I promise.
B00005N5S5|5.0|T2 was good, but T1 was better. I remember seeing this on a big screen when it first was released. My buddy had no idea about what the movie was going to be and both he and I were knocked out. All T2 was was to some extent &quot;more of the same&quot;. But for true movie thrills and excitement, T1 gets my vote.
B00003Q43A|3.0|The audio track of the DVD has some serious problems.  The dynamic range is limited and the volume level constantly changes.  Whenever the great low frequency rumble should be present, the sound reduces to a whisper.  These problems do NOT exist on the VHS version.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Worth the price for when Ripley takes charge of the transportation!
B0000041Q3|5.0|All of the singers included in this cd have extraordinarily powerful voices, which are required in order to sing Puccini's Turandot. Pavarotti is, in my opinion, the only tenor with enough power to sing the popular and spectacular Nessun Dorma. Consider yourself fortunate to own this piece. Turandot is truly one of the greatest operatic pieces of all time.
0800141660|1.0|This movie is so boring that I had to get up and &quot;go to the restroom&quot; 4 times because I got tired of my wife elbowing me when I fell asleep.<br />Each time I came back it seemed that they must have stopped the movie to wait for me.  All the same period-dressed actors and actresses sitting in some room in what I guess was a mansion owned by one of them. And they talked and talked and talked...zzzzz.<br />Plus, it was difficult to tell the actors apart (they should have used some sort of distinguishing devices to help the viewer). Ditto for the actresses, they must have been twins, triplets or quads. And they talked and talkd and talked.  What the heck were they talking about that seemed to keep everyone else so fascinating?<br />No action.  Little humor. Somewhat like a daytime soap opera with their clothes left on.<br />Now, when my wife gets mad at me, she threatens to buy the VHS and make me watch the whole thing.  She's pretty clever because the thought of that potential torture keeps me on my best behavior for hours afterwards.<br />I'll say this in closing...maybe I missed all the good parts when I &quot;left for the restroom&quot; all those times I fell asleep.  And my wife loved the movie. Remember, opposites attract and all that.
630575067X|5.0|Well thats an understatement I enjoy th whole Star Wars saga. And this is the cherry to top the ice cream sundae. Unlike others I think Jar Jar isn't totally annoying. I heard on the dvd you will be able to take jar jar away. If your looking for a star wars site go to theforce.net
6305949638|5.0|This film has affected me in ways I can't explain. It was beautiful and harrowing. It was heartwarming, it was painful, it was gentle, it was brutal, it was tragic, it was uplifting. Homer Wells is the touchstone for all of those feelings, and I just wish I could put it better than that. <br />&quot;An innocent abroad&quot; is not all there is to it....Homer is a blank slate in all respects but one. At approximately 20, he's almost a child himself, except that he knows everything there is to know about birth, and more than we ordinarily know about its alternative. His mentor and loving father figure, Dr. Larch, has brought the boy up as a medical prodigy.<br />This is the eager soul who sets out on the road one day from his lifelong shelter at St. Cloud's orphanage, at the sudden impulse driven by love at first sight. His heart's hope, Candy Kendall, is in a committed relationship with Wally Worthington, would-be WWII bomber pilot, who quickly becomes Homer's best friend before shipping out to the Burma run. Homer is an earnest, needy young man with good core values and a helpful disposition. This combination is a recipe for a complicated life.<br />Situational ethics are at the core of this film. Homer has to confront his heart in every circumstance, even the literal sense...he is given by Dr. Larch to believe his heart itself is physically vulnerable (Dr. Larch's way of ensuring Homer will not end up in the war). It surely is given spiritual tests of every kind. Dr. Larch, with completely moral intentions, is in the abortion business (the reason for Candy and Wally's visit to St. Cloud's) as much as in the adoption business. His fatherly love for Homer allows him to lie to the boy about Homer's own health with a clear conscience. His belief in giving choices to desperate women allows him to commit felonies (at the time) also with a clear conscience. Homer understands abortion as a practical need but, as an orphan, develops a personal philosophy against it. Homer accepts Dr. Larch's practices but won't practice abortion himself. Homer takes all of this and more with him into the world.<br />It's the story of how people deal with the conflicting values that they believe in. Candy loves Wally, and she needs Homer. Homer is an orphan who cherishes life but must confront abortion as a realistic option. Dr. Larch is a father figure without children of his own, and his need for Homer to succeed him is the need not only of an orphanage director for a sympathetic colleague, but also the need of a doting parent. There is a lot going on here and it doesn't allow for simple resolution.<br />So months later, I am still coming to terms with it. That makes this a great film in my estimation.
B00000IQMT|5.0|The star wars episode 1 soundtrack is better than the trilogy soundtrack. I enjoy duel of the fates and Anakins theme is nice as well. I enjoy hearing it when im trying to relax. John Williams the ultimate.

0312952813|5.0|A while back I read &quot;THE BLACK ECHO&quot;, Connelly's first Harry Bosch story. I liked it a lot, but held my rating to 4 stars. I didn't want to be too easy, after all. Well, now I've read Connelly's second tale, &quot;THE BLACK ICE&quot; and I'm convinced: this guy is good. &quot;THE BLACK ICE&quot; starts with the apparent suicide of a narc. Before long, though, Harry finds a connection between the death of the narc, Calexico Moore, and another case he is working on involving the murder of a drug runner. Then a connection turns up to another murder, that of an unidentified Mexican whose body was dumped behind a local diner. Coincidence? Harry doesn't think so. While the actual nature of Calexico Moore's death wasn't a huge surprise by the time I reached the end of the story, it was certainly an interesting ride getting there. This story has plenty of twists and turns in it, and even Harry becomes a target before it's all over. It's a page-turner from beginning to end. It's also believable, and the characters have depth and believability (except I do take issue with Harry's ability to go several days on virtually no sleep and still function effectively, but that is a small thing). Connelly isn't Doyle, and Harry Bosch isn't Sherlock Holmes, but if you like modern, gritty police procedurals then give Connelly's books a try. Keeping in mind that Holmes is 5+ star material, then this is about 4.7 star stuff. Good enough to round off at 5 stars. It was a page-turner for me and I recommend it.
B000021Y77|4.0|This movie made me laugh harder than most movies I've seen in recent memory.<br />I'm currently learning German, and in this movie I could not hear certain words said. And other times, words are spoken so quickly it was hard for me to understand.<br />Despite these things, this movie has one additional thing: Heart.<br />The things that \\"lola\\" will do to save her boyfriend.. Hahahaha!
B000002WPI|5.0|Without a doubt the greatest of all time. If you dont agree and say something like Biggie or one of Tupac's was the greatest, then you dont fully understand and feel real hiphop. This album is remarkable, but their albums after this ....... well lets just say they dont even come close.
0525945636|1.0|For the author of &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot;,  &quot;On the wings of eagles&quot; this is a disappointig book.  I bought it in the airport before a long intercontinental flight,  thinking it would take me trough the flight.  That was two weeks ago,  I still didn't finish it.  If you look for a cold war - time, spy novel,  try something else.  To bad for Follet.
0385495323|5.0|Excellent and informative, kept my attention throughout, provides a thurough history and speculates toward the future in a very realistic manner.
B00000IAU3|4.0|Although a bit overproduced, Angel still is interesting musicaly and manages to combine interesting lyrics, rythyms, with Di's unique athough somewhat limited vocals.<br />Opener &quot;Here with Me&quot; and the number 5 track &quot;All you want&quot; provide instant pop-hit type material that is listenable, catchy, and with lyrics that are contagiously universal.<br />I haven't yet listened to this album the 20 times or so necessary to fully appreciate everything it has to offer, but I can confidently say, it is not one of those where every song is great.  On the other hand, there isn't much reason to pull it out of the cd player before it's finished.<br />If there is anything objectionable about this effort, it is the sound machine qualities that surface in the various tracks, a couple places with 8 bars of drums machine can be a little trying.   Although this is a cd that starts strong (The first 5-6 songs are pretty credible), unfortunantly, it runs out of gas a bit on the tracks after that.<br />All in all not a bad effort for the first album and I have no regrets about picking it up. At least we can say it has some intelligent and interesting things to offer.  But what I'm really hoping is that there is something better yet to come.
6300251616|4.0|If you can keep a straight face after the Elevator Scene, you are deader than Kai of the Lexx.  <br />On a serious note, For all the complaints about cheesy effects and low-budget, this is likely to be closer to the REALITY of Deep Space Exploration in the next century - the months and years of boredom and loneliness, the disappointments and frustrations, the all-too-human screwups that may kill entire crews, than any other SF film I've ever seen.
6305205620|3.0|I saw most of this performance on VH1 last month. At the time, I had never seen a live Metallica performance before. I read the reviews for both Cunning Stunts and S&amp;M. At the time I thought that some reviewers were over-exagerating the quality of James Shetfield's vocals. However, having recently bought S&amp;M, I can both see and hear the difference.  In Cunning Stunts, he is odviously straining on some of Metallica's older material. I'm also reasonably sure he does the &quot;call and reply&quot; routine on the parts of songs he couldn't do anymore. I don't know what he did with himself, but two years later in S&amp;M James is back. He can actually hit the correct notes, and just doesn't sound as tired and worn out as he did on Cunning Stunts.<br />I gave this DVD three stars because, hey, it's Metallica. They'll always be cool live. Any other band would have gotten a two or a one from me. But not Metallica.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Behind the tenderness and the simple story, there is a characteristically dark current running through the images, music and sounds in this film, a feeling of impending darkness. It never manifests itself, but the feeling is there in the abstract, resounding like the magnificent sounds of a towering grain elevator. A constant reminder that in spite of the film's G rating, this is still a David Lynch picture, and he winks at us with subtle suggestions and imagery that will stay with you long after the film has ended. Beautifully photographed, the film displays Lynch's mastery of mood, composition and colour. His second road movie (after Wild At Heart), a marvel of linear storytelling, and a masterpiece. The digital transfer is beautiful, the colours are vivid, the picture is sharp, and the sounds are crystal clear. Highly recommended.
0380973839|2.0|The first time I read this book, a few years ago, I loved it and I worshipped Ray Bradbury. I found it profound and funny and sad and everything a good book should be and then some.<br />The second time I read it...not so much.  Maybe I'm getting older and more cynical.  His bright-eyed enthusiasm and innocence is still refreshing, but the bemoaning of All We've Ruined gets a little old.  And I find it a little disturbing that he repeatedly kills off the boring close-minded characters... like they don't deserve to live.  And we haven't lost our imaginations and this planet isn't done for -- yet.  Amazing how such an enthusiastic optimist can have so little hope.<br />There are still gems and beauty here.  The best thing about it is that it's not at all what you expect from the title(an effect clearly lost the second time through) and the absurdity of man is wonderfully funny at times.  I guess I mostly just wish it didn't  harp on the same things story after story.   [...]
B00005A0V0|5.0|I bought this album back in the 70's when I was 16 years old. A friend recommended it back then as an entry level record for &quot;not the usual staff&quot; progressive type of music. Although I have not listened to the album for some 20 years now, the music and the lyrics still hover in my head! Since then I lost the album, and browsing through amazon it came back to me as a record I must have in my collection. Really outstanding album, highly recommended to anyone interested in the &quot;not so popular&quot;, &quot;jazzy type of staff&quot;, &quot;nobody can dance to&quot;.

0316776963|5.0|Borrowed and plowed through this book in a few days on a busy vacation this summer.  LOVED IT. Unusual humor, well written, easy to read and funny as hell.  Some good themes to think about, as well.  I only read a handful of nonfiction books a year, and am glad I grabbed this one.  Couldn't put it down till it was over, and when it was gone, I was wishing for more.
1878424319|5.0|This work stopped my daughter short.  She said, &quot;Dad, I'm already happy!&quot;  I was glad to hear that.  I kept picking through it anyway, and have found it to be an important book in my life.  The book proffers the idea that following four basic ideas could make a difference in your life.  It's an idea I accepted, and its already had an impact in my life.  The agreements are some concepts I was already exposed to, such as the power of your word.  The explanation of the agreements is clear and simple.  The timing of this book coming into my life withstanding, the impact it will have on tomorrow remains to be seen.  But I agree it will be quite more interesting than yesterday, as I look to see the difference a few agreements make.
B000001DTM|5.0|The songs on this CD are the best! From softer songs like &quot;One&quot;, to energetic songs like &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, you'll be listening to Achtung Baby wherever you go!
B000001G50|5.0|I would recommend this cd to anyone who just getting into classical music, as it contains some of the more familiar, less complex classical favorites.  It is superbly played and full of emotion, very easy to listen to.  The Canon in D is easily the best version I have ever heard.  This is still a great recording for those with significant classical music collections, though.  It is extremely well conducted, with clear, artful articulation in all the pieces.  The adagio has some problems with feedback on the organ, but they are negligible.  It is all around a great buy.
0316776963|2.0|Although I found moments in Sedaris' book laugh-out-loud funny and appreciated some of his more trenchant observations, I felt the book lost its momentum halfway through. From that point on, it seemed contrived, overextended and (in terms of humor) sophomoric. <br />In the end, this didn't turn out to be a book I would recommend.

When I bought on DVD, I rushed home to watch the extra features.  Heh Heh Heh!  Nothing, zip, zadda!<br />If you love this movie and don't have it, buy it.<br />But in order to get the best possible, BUY THE SPECIAL EDITION.  IT IS THE SAME COST AS THE REGULAR EDITION!

B00004TJLD|5.0|I am not normally a fan of MFSL cd releases because they sound too &#34;flat&#34; to my ears, but this I Robot release sounds excellent. I have every incarnation that I Robot has ever come out in, including the original MFSL silver disc, SHM, DAD Classics, Blu-Spec, even the MFSL UHQR vinyl. This is right up there with any of them. Faithfully reproduced mini-lp format as well. Well worth it for any APP fan.

B00004ZAV3|3.0|While this is a very bizarre way to package up the Beatles, I do give it credit for opening up their music to a lot of kids today. Almost everyone in my eighth grade class has this CD and listens to it, which seems downright strange, considering how only a select few knew any Beatles songs before.  But it's such a weird way to compile the hits! As a few people have pointed out, it skips over everything in Sgt. Pepper's (which, while not my favorite album, has some really important music on it), the white album, and I think Rubber Soul. Please Please Me isn't on it, which I thought was a number one. To someone who's known the Beatles this is very odd to listen to. A lot of my friends stopped thinking I was completely crazy and went out and bought some of the albums, so it can't be all bad! : )
B00005MAM2|5.0|For the uninitiated to Anime, Akira is the prototype. Everything great about Anime is here -- Rich scenes, bold action, powerful emotions and a mind-bending plot.<br />The Special Edition vocals are a departure from the old vocals, and, as other reviewers here note, are not always an improvement. The translation is also subtly different, with fewer memorable lines. However the story is easier to understand at the same time. Both versions have their high and low points...<br />The DVD transfer, BTW, is flawless -- and the soundtrack on DVD (I had worn out my VHS type) is impressive with my 5-speaker Dolby Digital setup. <br />The movie also has some of the downsides of much Anime -- some characters are cardboard cutouts, the animation has moments of lameness that appear dated followed by beautiful, flowing chase scenes. And the movie does not always make perfect sense, but then, if you are watching a movie about people who can channel pure energy, why get technical?<br />Warning for all squeamish people: This movie is NOT for you. More people die in this movie than in Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Pearl Harbor combined. (Of course, 20 million people die in the first scene, but that's beside the point...many of the deaths are graphic and my wife had a hard time watching).<br />The Special Edition includes lots of neat extras on the second disc -- trailers, making of, cool stuff about the weird instruments used to make the eerie music, and an interview with the creator, who doesn't seem to realize the enormity of his creation.
0767903862|4.0|I checked out this book (sold in the UK under the title 'Down Under'), on a trip to the US, and found it to be a good read.<BR>I have read most of Bryson's books and have found them to be interesting and informative. He has the ability to find value in relatively ordinary experiences that many people can relate to.<br />However his comments about the UK and Australia during the war are unfortunate. As well as fighting Japan, the UK was fighting a total war against Germany. To suggest that the UK turned its back on Australia is naive.<br />Even so, the book is enjoyable, and all the reader really needs to know after finishing it is how they can free up a few weeks and the cost of a return ticket to Australia. To summarize, this book like much of his work is amusing and can often inspire the reader.
0380002930|1.0|ok i really hated this book, i had to read it for summer reading and it took me the whole summer to get into it. it was way too long and had so much extra stuff with no point at all except that rabbits moved to a different place and got scared by the stupidest things. only read it if you are forced to or like rabbits way to much .
0684874350|4.0|I will be absolutely frank (no pun intended) here and let you know this was a difficult read for me.  The memoirs of Frank McCourt were so devastating that I simply wanted to put it down and never remember that I had ever heard of it.  So why did I continue to read it?  It is beautifully written and I had such hopes that these children who knew nothing but starvation, death, chilled bones, bed bugs, and tragedy from the day they were a seed in their mothers womb, could find a bit of joy and happiness in their lives.  And as Frank McCourt shared his dreary childhood with me through this novel, he added lots of humor.  I found myself smiling when I knew I should have been weeping.  Without this humor, I don't know if I could have read about the alcholic father that worked all week only to take his money and spend it at the pub getting drunk while the children and his wife were home with no food, having to beg neighbors and strangers for something to eat.  Without McCourts humor I don't think I could read about how the children were beat and belittled by their teachers as well as other children in the name of learning.  Without a bit of humor I couldn't have forged on through the shameful treatment in the name of God that was dumped on this family by the church.   When I think about the life of these children and this family I guess without a few laughs in their lives they wouldn't have made it through their lives either. So I guess you are wondering if I recommend this book...yes.  Why, because this book is life.  Maybe not your life, and maybe not my life, but sometimes we need to know what other people have went through, and are going through to know.... my life isn't as bad as I thought!
0451203933|5.0|I got this book, and let it sit on my shelf for sometime before I picked it up. When I did though, I started to feel like these fine operators were dropped right into the pits of darkest hell. Mark Bowden does outstanding work in two ways: First, he puts you right in there, amidst the confusion and all the FUBAR scenarios that Task Force Ranger, the combined Delta/Ranger/SEAL force, encounters. Second, this is a remarkable piece of work in that Bowden has a limited background in this, and had to do incredible amounts of research to turn out such an outstanding piece. Another aspect is the way the Somali perspective is also presented. Finally, if you follow SpecOps in any fashion, you'll quickly see how even the smallest factors can completely make the difference between how men train for these situations and how the conflict was ultimately prosecuted as a result of these unfortunate events. Get this book and gain a new level of appreciation for these men who provide our national security.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Won't go into a long review, but I'll say this, Children of Bodom is amazing, their music is absolutely unique, do yourself a favor, run out and buy this, because you will not regret it. CoB possesses some of the finest guitarrists in the scene, just listen to these raging solos in the songs, or the stunning riffs, and you'll know what I mean. Long story short, Children of Bodom creates some of the most beautiful music in the scene. You won't be disappointed once you buy it.
157492589X|5.0|There are so many things that make LONESOME DOVE such a legendary masterpiece. The writing, the high production values and of course, the superb acting by a cast more often associated with blockbusting feature films than T.V. This is such a respected cast here - you have the amazing ROBERT DUVALL (Deep Impact, The Apostle, Tender Mercies) as Gus McCrae, you have the wonderful DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Judge Dredd, Murder at 1600) as the vulnerable Lorena 'Lorie Darlin' Wood. And not forgetting the awesome TOMMY LEE JONES (The Fugitive, Double Jeopardy, Under Siege) as Woodrow Call. These GREAT ACTORS add amazing dimensionality to their characters and the charisma and human depth is something that gives LONESOME DOVE the edge over EVERY other T.V. production I have ever seen! A masterpiece in every sense. The DVD is good but not great. The picture and sound could have been better but are by no means bad. The picture is a little soft in places and the sound lacks real impact, although the score is great. However, it is the best presentation I have ever seen of this particular film. A shame that they couldn't fit on 'The Making Of' documentary that was once available with excellent interviews with ROBERT DUVALL, TOMMY LEE JONES, DIANE LANE etc.
0345350499|1.0|This a  disappointing book.  It focuses way too much of its energy on the female participents.  Without the male characters  there isn't a legend to write about.  I love strong women as much as the next guy, but the entire story isn't about women.  I also don't like all the focus on the battle between the mother goddess and Christianity.  By the time Arthur came on the scene the people of Britain had embrassed Christianity.  Also I don't think there is any evidence to support a mother goddess cult in Britain.  Also Miss Bradley portrays the Druids as these nice smart guys.  In reality they were just as pagan as everyone else.  She doesn't even touch on the fact that there is evidence that the Druids performed human sacrifices.  The book is also way to sappy.  It almost reads like a really long soap opera.  Other than that it was a good book.
B00004XONN|5.0|I am  very critical of music. It is very hard for me to give anybody props to so called great music.  After I hearing Kid A, I gonna give my first five star rating (this is only my second review on Amazon. I reviewed amnesiac and gave it four stars).  I raised myself on Hip-hop music.  For 18 years, the only music i would buy (not listen too.  I am very opened-minded about music.)was hip-hop. I talked the wu-language (i still think wu-tang is the greatest music entity ever created.).  In 97, I was first introduced to Radiohead through their fantastic video for Parnoid android ,but i didn't follow up on them and purchase Ok computer. One day during 2000, i was thinking to myself whatever happen to radiohead not knowing that ok computer was considered one of the greatest albums of all-time.  To make a long story short I read i favorable review of Kid A in that stupid magazine rolling stone and it peaked my curiosty to hear this so called weird album.  I purchased OK, and Kid A on the same day. Computer blew me away then i listend to Kid A and was floored by such creativity by a \\"mainstream\\" group.(other people have me made music like this they were just not a million unit selling \\"rock band\\".).  This ablum is perfect in all ways possible. The closer, motion picture soundtrack, literally sends a chill down my back.  \\"how disappear completely\\" (except prymaid song) is the most gorgeous song i have heard in years.  Most reviewers say this album is cold and inhuman.  I strongly disagree.  Underneath the cold exterior and electronics beats a very human heart.  This album sounds like a man scared to show his head in  society and is trying to disappear from this cold world we live in.  People we live in a very cold world eventhough people ignorant to the fact will tell you otherwise.  Kid A is the soundtrack to our world.  Listen to \\"in limbo\\" closely.  It sounds like a man spiraling into madness cause he can longer deal with his surroundings.  The lyrics on this album are subdued but with small pharses the message is still potent and meaningful. This album is very introverted and in my opinion (being an introvert myself)introverts are the only people who can truly understand this album for what it is. You have to be capable of contemplation and philosphizing to grasp the full effect something loud mouths are uncapable of. (i'm not insulting anyone just stating a point.)  This is not, i repeat, is not diffcult or weird album (bjork is weirder).  Kid A is not for everybody and that is how radiohead likes it.  They are finding their true fanbase.  I sick and tried of reading reviews where people complain about the lack of guitars.  If you want guitars, Queens of the stone age have plenty of good guitar work (they are good band).  Kid A in my opinion the greatest album of this era (excluding the Beatles it's hard to top anything they made.) Radiohead have put their reputation on the line making such a reclusive record and... this is how the world really is. Their are no fake smiles and gestures on this album.  Radiohead exposes man's faults for all to see starting with Ok Computer continuing with Kid A and Amensiac.  Radiohead, along with the Beatles, are the most creative and musically talented \\"rock\\" band of all-time. (This is my opinion.  If i had my way, wu-tang's music would be taught at every major university to be examined and studied).  Radiohead is no longer rocking your high school parties anymore.  Get over it, radiohead is deeper than clothes, dating, expensive cars and being fake to fit in.  Kid A is an album for people who exactly understands and has the knowledge to see what is going on around them in this world.  People do not be scared of the unknown. Buy this album a listen closely.  Radiohead is trying to teach you something.
B000007SIJ|3.0|This is a review of the DTS version. As stated in other DTS 5.1 CD reviews, the older 70's music is taken from the 4 channel era and the vinyl that was released for Quadraphonic CD4, SQ &amp; QS systems. Since these were mixed for 4 speakers and not 6, the center channel is lacking and the subwoofer is weak. The DTS surround is fun, but that too has it's problems... the sound is mixed more to dazzle you with movement than to place the listener in the middle of the band. The overall sound is crisp and the music is still some of the best to come out of the 70's, so if you want a piece of music history in a unique format, grab it, you may find an oldie reborn!
B00003CXFG|5.0|Let me just say Vin rocked in this.Many say its similar to aliens, sure but not all of the movie it like aliens. Go see this for what it is,not to compare it with aliens.
B00005B36H|5.0|too old tool fans, youll know that listening to Tool isnt just listening to a kewl CD, its a musical experience. I bought Lateralus the day it came out as i did for AENIMA and UNDERTOW. Lateralus is very diiferent and less aggressive as the rest of them but i think it is as or more melodic and artistic than AENIMA (which is the best). I have listened to this countless times and it is one of those albums that whatever mood yur in, dictates the idea of the song. Songs such as &quot;The Grudge&quot; and &quot;Schism&quot; but mostly &quot;The Patient&quot;, this is the most emotional song of the album to me. It is also one of my favs on the record. So you can tell this an experience. I wont name off bands (because im fans of most of them) but i cant name one band that can play as emotional and melodic songs yet get so aggressive as Tool except A Perfect Circle ( you can figure out why Hint: MJK) and maybe the Deftones (a few songs are melodic and emotional). I still have arguements with this &quot;Friend&quot; thats says tool music videos have nothing to do with there songs. If you you watch the Schism music video and think about the words youll understand (same with the rest of the videos). Favorite songs on the album 1.) Lateralus 2.) The Patient 3.) Parabola 4.) Ticks and Leeches 5.) Schism. But in all reality the whole CD is great and even though it nears 80 minutes long it is worth it in the end. If yur a fan of the ICP collective of mindless fans dont even bother listening to this no axes, clowns, insanity, or rap is in this album. And all 4 bands member play instruments and none wear face paint to resemble a clown. To Tool new comers, go with AENIMA first, then LATERALUS and A Perfect Circle's Mer De Noms, after that get OPIATE, then Undertow, if you do it in any other order you might not become a fan (i dont know why but i see people all the time buying Undertow first and an hour later say Tool sucks) but im not saying undertow isnt good, it is very good. Toolis on tour with King Crimson right now go to the concert when it comes to yur town. It is actually rumored theyll be at Ozzfest in the USA next year. The reason i put a perfect circle with Lateralus is that they have a similar sound they are both very melodic and emotional but have there aggressive moments.
0375805613|5.0|....my parents did!  I requested this book every night before I went to bed.  I didn't realize at the time that my parents were not actually reading the book, but telling it by memory.  Now that I have a child of my own, I remember all of the words too.  My son thought he could read at 2 years old because he also had the book memorized from reading it so often.  It is really that good...especially when read with feeling as if you really are Grover.  Grover hears the name of the book and gets scared because there is a monster at the end of the book.  He begs and pleads for you to not turn another page....but of course you have to because your child will tell you to (even if it does make Grover scared).  The ending is a bit of a surprise and even young children will understand the twist.
B00003CXRM|5.0|A Classic... What a relief to see a different kind (from the recent norm)of comedy.
B0000073NC|4.0|Back in 1974, there was a new German band making its way to the top, playing the kind of rock they believed in, with a great singer (Meine), a great songwriter (R. Schenker) and a virtuoso guitar player (Roth). THis FLY TO THE RAINBOW captures the marvellous quality of the band at the time. The tittle track is epic, fantastic. THe other tunes are diverse, sometimes simples, sometimes very creative, but always good. I must remember you tha, sadly, Roth left the band in 1979, and SCORPIONS went, with Mathhias Jabs, to pursue the &quot;AMERICAN DREAM...&quot;, be it: playing pop metal with silly love / sex lyrics... Sad...
B00005HYH2|4.0|This probably the 2nd most amazing and original psychedelic album ever released. The FIRST most amazing and original psychedelic album is the much better monoaural mix of the same album, as mixed by the band, and released only in Great Britain, in 1967, and briefly re-released on CD as a European Import only, back in 1997. But, since you probably can't find that one, please do make do with this one, which is also blessed with *all* the original artwork, which has never seen the light of day before as a CD reissue. This version of the LP *is* the original stereo mix by Norman(Hurricane)Smith, who you may remember as George Martin's assistant producer on Beatles LP's like \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\". Yes, it costs a bit more than the domestic release of the same CD, BUT it is an authentic miniature of the original stereo release. In fact, my only criticism, and the only thing that keeps me from giving a wholehearted five-star endorsement, is that they didn't include the several very different monoaural recording versions on the original mono mix of the LP, you see, three or four cuts really *are* significantly different, and could have easily been tacked on the end of the disc as bonus tracks!
B00005AACC|1.0|It will be a while before I watch another Tom Cruise movie again, because the dissapointment I felt after watching this movie is unbeliavable. First: Cruise destroyed Ethan Hunt, the TV-series character didn´t deserve that. 2) The chemistry between Cruise and Thadie NEwton is non-existant. 3) Most action sequences are laughable, ludicrous - the car chase with the female thief, the moutain-climbing without hopes, the jump from the motorcycles, with the two \\"macho\\" men clashing chest agaisnt chest in mid-air; 4) The mask subject is repeated over and over until it becomes a joke; 5) The coldness of the movie is so shocking, it makes clear the totally formulatic concept of the movie; 6) Hopkins presence is a farse, so brief it is.<br />If all of these motives are not enough to make this movie a turkey, then I don´t know nothing at all. I repeat: even watching this as a brainless action-adrenaline movie, it´s a horrible motion picture, ...
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I whent to see Moulin Rouge in it's opening week, expecting your tipical epic movies. What I saw was truly the best in movie making. <br />The songs inspired and reflected the true emotions of the caracters. The costumes reflected each moments of the film. Sateen's red gown was magnificent! If love was a dress, it would be that red dress. If love was a room it would be her elephant room. Scene after scene, this movie had me in awe. <br />I wish they made more movies like this!!!
0345349571|5.0|I recently read this book as required summer reading, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The trivia is real, the people are real, and by the end you feel as if you know Enguerrand VII. The style and vocabulary is incredible, and Barbara Tuchman does a wonderful job in this great narrative. If you are a history fan, you must read this.
B000002GLV|5.0|This is an outstanding reissue that deserves a listen by all blues fans.  Mayall's legacy may well be assembling and recognizing talent long before those individual's move on to become household names.  Here however, Mayall keeps the formula simple by adding the trumpet of Blue Mitchel and Sax of Clifford Solomon with the guitar of Freddy Robinson and the precussion of Ron Selico for some fantastic, ahead of its time, Blues with a Jazz flavor. Stand outs are the Trumpet led &quot;Good Times Boogie&quot; and the jam, &quot;Exercise In C Major For Harmonica&quot;  If you missed it the first time around on vinyl, be sure and pick it up on CD.  Simply outstanding.
6303418287|3.0|This is the sort of film that can be panned on just about every count, yet is enjoyable to relax in front of (perhaps on Halloween night) as one consumes popcorn, Milk Duds, and the other enjoyable &quot;junk food,&quot; into which category this film fits neatly.<br />For literary types such as myself (who naturally blush to admit that they find this film rather fun), I suppose the fascination is in imagining what a fine concept the screen writer's had in this adaptation. Finding out more about Victor's motivation to create life, seeing how totally it dominated him, musing over how fascinating it would be for an adventurous medical student to meet a professor who combines ancient philosophy with modern science, seeing the blind man understand the sad plight of the monster - all could have been excellent devices for fleshing out Mary Shelley's often plodding tale.<br />Unfortunately, the ideas which could have been fine seasoning were laid on with too heavy a hand. The key word in this film is &quot;excess&quot; - over-acting, hysterics intended as dramatic impact, bizarre scenes, uproar out of proportion to the action. After a time, the memories of Victor's mother's death, which, combined with the excessive enthusiasm for new dimensions of medicine, which made sense in the early scenes seem macabre, with the unlikely conclusion coming forth that the death of the child born to her was the inevitable result of the chain of events her death set in motion.<br />I rated it as a &quot;three&quot; because what could have been interesting drama and failed has some entertainment value as high camp.
0767849493|3.0|I have heard so many good things about this movie. I like Kevin Smith in general. I don't have such a rigid religious attatchment that I would dislike it just for its subject matter. It was just so strikingly average. It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't good, and it definitely wasn't great. Basically, it was a disappointment. The religious things discussed were old and cliche, and the novelty of swearing angels wore off well before the first 20 minutes were over. See this I guess if you're huge on Kevin Smith or really hate religion, but otherwise I doubt it'll make a huge impact on you.
0312243022|5.0|Having read this glorious feast of a book and then looking over the oddly variable reviews, I can only conclude that its enjoyment must hinge upon having a poetic sensibility. Whatever else may be said pro or con about &quot;The Hours&quot; it's difficult not to acknowledge the book's extraordinary poetry. If one is sensitive to poetic language and imagination, the book is a treat-- simply so, unarguably so, appreciatively so. But if you don't give a hang about poetry, or are deaf to its appeals, why then of course you are frustrated and you are resentful that someone has come along and wasted your precious time. Without the willingness to savor and the willingness to reflect, it's all, as they say, in one ear and out the other...
B000059ZLH|2.0|My rating of this DVD does not reflect my enthusiasm about this band, or the concert that is recorded here. Where Rush began to fade in the 90's, Dream Theater picked up the torch of progressive rock, and moved on! Dream Theater rocks folks! There's more talent in this band than I've seen in a progressive rock band in a long time. That being said, I think this latest effort (Scenes From A Memory) is a little pretentious. Concept albums are difficult to get right.  It requires the right mix of message and execution, and 'Scenes' seems to missing something to me. With standards like Floyds 'The Wall', Genesis' 'The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway', and Rush's '2112' to compete with, it's is a very tall order. OK, back to this DVD, which I am watching as I type this on my laptop.  The quality of the video, and audio production is so far below DVD standards, it's pathetic. Compare this with the Eagles 'Hell Freezes Over'. My God! The Eagles DVD envelopes you in sound with it's DTS soundtrack, and it has equisite video coverage. No comparison. All that aside, it is great to watch these guys play! And I am not upset that I bought the DVD (VHS is so gouch!) Besides the DVD has more goodies. But I challenge Dream Theater to capture some truly great video and audio for another DVD. I want a DTS soundtrack dang it!
0792839625|1.0|I was so extremely dissapointed to see this film. Just by listening to the original Broadway cast album you'd know that this piece of trash movie musical can not compare to what it was on stage. It is another prime example of Hollywood taking something that was once really great and making it absolute filth. Granted I never saw the musical on Broadway because I'm only 14, but I know that this movie can't even compare to the original cast album let alone the original cast on Broadway. Whoever was responsible for leaving out bits and pieces of the original lyrics by Edward Kleban should not only be fired but tarred and feathered. I cannot tell you how horrible this movie made me feel, not only at the bad acting and watered-down performaces, but the fact that I wasn't born in the era that I could have seen this wonderful play on Broadway. ... I wouldn't even give it 1 star except that it's a scale of 1-5. ... We'll just have to wait for this play to be revived and than it could be enjoyed the way it should be.
B00005B5L4|4.0|I bought this audio DVD with the expectation that i would at least be able to HEAR the music, if not get the whole 'new' experience, on my DVD player.  I was very disapointed.  All I got were disc error messages, until I bought a DVD-Audio player.  This is what it is all about.  Anyone should be impressed with the sound of the remix, the vidio clips, the over-dubbed artist comments and all the other extra goodies.  If it wasn't for my initial disapointment, I would have given this disc a five-plus rating.  If you love Fleetwood Mac, buy it!
B000002G23|5.0|This incredible box set moves listeners beyond the &quot;Every Breath you Take&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing She Does is Magic Police&quot;. This set spans the career of The Police,  demonstrating the evolution of sound,  depth of lyrics, and transition between styles that make The Police one of the greatest bands ever. Message in a box contains the &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;misses&quot;, and since the set is all inclusive the listener is able to decide which songs fall into which category. Greatest hits discs be damned!  <br /> My favorite disc is the third, featuring songs of a fairly jazzy and ethereal nature. But again, with a box set of this magnitude the listener is able to make their own decesion about which songs are &quot;the best&quot;.  <br /> This set is a must have for the music fan.
B000000WG4|5.0|I can't believe this album was produced at 1973, it is the most innovative sounds at that period, and you can define it is an new age music, but made it in 3 eras early! He plays 20 different instruments, he got a lot of inspiration and creatives. The talent composer.
B00005B36H|5.0|When I first bought Lateralus, I listened to it a few times and, although impressed, went back to listening to Aenima.  After seeing and hearing the band perform tracks from Lateralus, I was compelled to give it another listen.  This is what I heard after thoroughly deconstructing the CD:  Buy this CD because it's better than any heavy metal out there, but also buy it for the vocalization and drumming.  The drumming is insane!  How many arms does this guy have?!?  Tracks #8 and #12 are a showcase for the tribal drumming the band experimented with throughout this CD.  But for some of the oddest pairing of vocals and drumming that you've ever heard, check out the beginning of track #1 and the end of track #9.  Amazing the way Keenan and Carey work together.  The lead guitar is sharp and crisp on this CD--far different than the heavy, crunchy sound on Aenima.  Love the bass playing on this CD, especially track #11.  Vocals, lyrics, vocals, lyrics!! People get a little sick of boring, mindless lyrics that insult your intelligence.  In keeping with TOOL's writing style, the thought-provoking lyrics of Lateralus don't disappoint.  You don't have to agree with their philosophy, but you can't listen without re-evaluating your own beliefs.  Never a dull moment with Maynard's vocals; he keeps you guessing where a note is going to fall or rise.  He switches unexpectedly between gutteral wailing and melancholy singing.  He sings sweetly on track #11 and yells like an animal on track #1 (if you want to hear the best yell in rock to date, check out track #1 at around the seven minute mark).  If I had to pick a favorite track, it would be the powerful instrumental track #12 because it sounds as if the individuals are playing with complete abandon, yet all the sounds just fit perfectly.  To be fair to TOOL's creative process, I won't say that Lateralus is better than anything else they've done, but I will say that their music evolves brilliantly with each release.  Buy this CD!
0452282152|3.0|I'd heard the hype.  I'd seen the title on the best seller list for ages.  I took the bait and started to read.<br />And I was disappointed.<br />The story has so much potential, but the author left too many loose ends and in many respects was far too superficial for my tastes.  I did not think that the character of Griet was fully developed, and I was left scratching my head about Vermeer.  What prompted him to paint?  Why did he see things diferently than normal folk?  What made him a great artist?<br />All this being said, if you want a four star mindless beach read, this book suits the bill.
0380002930|1.0|I have read through it a few times but...maybe it's just way over my head. It just didn't click with me at all, I didn't feel anything coming from the words, they were just...there. It was quite dull and complicated and really confusing. I also read what seemed to be a ghost story by this same author, but it also didn't click with me, maybe it's his writing style? Ahh well. I'll give this book another chance, it has been a while since i've read it. I hope I haven't insulted anyone, this was just my experience with this particular book.
B00003CX5A|1.0|This movie HAD potential and was interesting up to a point. But basically this whole film turns out to be an infomercial promoting WICCA. This movie blows big time. Yes its got the &quot;original&quot; 90's theme of the evil intolerant Christians vs. the wholesome, good hearted witches who desire nothing more than to spread goodnes and mirth through the use of occult charms and satanic spells. Take my advice - pass on this one and don't let your kids watch it. Pure new age propaganda plain and simple.
0783228007|5.0|very underratted western.You will never see a better movie in it`s time.Why the dvd is not in 5.1 surround is beyond me.The scenes in this movie are beautifull.plaese release eastwood movies in 5.1 surrond.take the time do it right.We will pay the money for a great product.
0790729628|5.0|Timeless, moody, dark and rainy. All of my favorite things! This is my favorite movie of all time. I only own two VHS tapes and this is one of them. Did I mention robots, action, and a future vision that makes you want to lock the door and ignore the sirens outside.
B000001Y42|4.0|Limp Bizkit may have become the worst sellouts ever with \\"Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" (except for Wes Borland, who was unhappy with Fred's actions), but \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'All\\" will always be the band's best CD ever. It's a perfect example of the naked rage that's been fading from a few rap metal bands today (Hed P.E. for example, though they're still a good band).<br />Wes Borland and Sam Rivers's guitar and bass work is raw and relentless, just like John Otto's drumming, which is the most technical ever done in the band's career. DJ Lethal's turntable work is also impressive and a little atmospheric (especially in \\"Everything\\"), but the most memorable member on the CD is the frontman: Fred Durst. His voice may sound whiny at first listen, but he's acting emotional while rapping. And it's super-catchy. Even with his ear-crushing screams, you can almost picture the bloodshot rage (which he once had here) in his eyes.<br />Every track on here is good, from the chord-crushing \\"Counterfeit\\" to the beautiful, eerie atmosphere of \\"Everything\\", which will be great to relax to after jumping up and down to the beat of the heavier songs before it. \\"Pollution\\" is an awesome opener, and \\"Stalemate\\" has a great intro with a hawaiian-sounding guitar (before kicking into a faster pace later). \\"Sour\\" is a classic with lyrics that are actually pretty funny, just like those in the moody, slow-paced \\"Stink Finger\\"(which IS NOT rip off Tool's \\"Stinkfist\\" in any way as some LB haters claim. It's just about a neighbor that made Fred's life miserable).<br />Bottom Line: Check out this CD. Even if you dislike rapcore, its worth a listen.
B000002OR4|5.0|How can one describe such songs in words.  The melodies, the simplicity yet complexity.  Hauntingly beautiful and sensational all the while.  I first listened to this track and instantly fell in love.  The work of Itzhak Perlman like no other is beautifully engrossed in each string vibrated on the violin he plays.  This soundtrack is a must buy, not only beautifully done and sensational to listen to, but each melodic note pierces the soul as if someone reached inside you and squeezed your heart.  This has to be one of the best scores I have ever heard, a few come next in place, but hardly touches it.  The only dissapointment in this soundtrack was that the song &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; wasn't included.  Watching the characters interact within the music of Schindler's List was so enigmatic and hearbreaking and so very beautiful.  I don't know how many times I can say that but it truly is.
B000001FZK|5.0|Starting with the sound of shimmering, chorused guitar, deep bass, and formless, barely audible percussive notes on the drum kit, this album completely reverses the trends that their previous masterwork _Spirit Of Eden_ established.  Its rock-jazz deconstructed to its basest elements, formless and pulsing with an indescribable anger, balanced sidelong with an almost tragic sense of hope.  <br />You can hear the anger in songs like &quot;Ascension Day&quot; which works its way through some nice Hammond riffs, thoughtful harmonica touches from the amazing Mark Feltham, steady, workmanlike  backbeat from Lee Harris, and plaintive, emotional vocal delivery from Mark Hollis to a stunning, cathartic climax where every member of the group literally seems to be beating on their instruments - skewn and torn, jagged chords fly over rumbling bass thwaps and crashing drums, which suddenly and abruptly comes to a crashing halt to the gorgeous piano and echoing strands of backwards guitar that marks the entrance of the epic &quot;After The Flood&quot;.  Just when you think things are safe you are literally skewered with pitiful outcries of emotional anguish, and a dissonant, formless feedback solo, an ugly contrast to the beautiful, hypnotic backbeat of organ, sitars, bubbling bongs, crashing waves, delicate rimshots and gently strummed, echoing guitar.  Words can try to describe but not capture the stunning beauty of this song, and when I listen to this album I am usually unable to make it past this piece simply because its so damn affecting.  <br />It seems meaningless to say this about such a daring album, but side 2 is far more self-consciously experimental.  The formless and affecting &quot;Taphead&quot; strikes me as impressionistic jazz, and affirms not only the band's significant departure from most major rock idioms but probably is compositionally their best work ever.  Hollis is barely audible here, as the orchestra gradually builds behind him and his simple guitar work, lashing out with long, angular, atonal swatches of sound, almost reminiscent of Debussy.  Then there's the (comparatively) upbeat &quot;New Grass&quot; which is a joyous, minimalistic, yet also subdued piece that brings tears to my eyes.  It contrasts beautiful piano lines with a simple three-note woodwind melody and Hollis' voice, rich and exuberant yet sad at the same time.  &quot;Ruineii&quot; never leaves much of an impression  on me; its along the same lines as &quot;Taphead&quot; as Hollis' voice gently wafts over desolate keyboard lines to whisper a quiet conclusion.<br />The twofer &quot;Ascension Day&quot; and &quot;After the Flood&quot;, for a brief moment, bring together the perfection of vision, the beauty and mystery that this band ultimately disintigrated trying to achieve.  You have to wonder, even with all the trouble this and _Spirit of Eden_ purportedly caused EMI and  Polydor during their construction, how could the record companies ultimately be so cold to try to deny the world art of this magnitude?  If you think _Kid A_ was a statement in 2001, you really have to find out for yourselg about what kind of a timeless and far more realized statement this album made in 1991.  Simply one of the most amazing pieces of music I own.
0792833236|4.0|The Film: First of all, I loved 'Raging Bull'. It is a great story about a man who had everything and lost it all. The film is about Jake LaMotta, a boxer who can take a beating in the ring and win with it. But outside the ring, he has even worse beatings. They are all aflicted by himself. He has uncontrollable outbreaks of violence, a fear of infedelity and a never-ending urge to prove himself right. He abuses his wife, attacks his brother, and the whole time destroying himself. Robert De Niro did this roll so well. He became the part. He trained in boxing to get in shape and learn the part and even won two of the three matches he was in. Then he put on 50lbs for the latter part of the movie, Jake's decline. The film is such a great one with the most spectacular fight scenes ever seen.<br />The DVD: This DVD is really disappointing. It has hardly any extra features. It comes with a trailer and the movie. Plus, the movie gives you the option of widescreen and pan and scan. Aren't DVD's all about being able to watch the film in widescreen, the way the director intended it to be? I'm sure Martin Scorsese never wanted it to be shown in pan and scan, even if it was only 1:85:1. I think the DVD should at least have put in a documentary or maybe put the 8-page booklet on the DVD. If you want a good Scorsese DVD, check out 'Taxi Driver-SE' or 'Cape Fear'. Wait, and pray that they come out with a 'Raging Bull- Special Edition' DVD.
B00004WGAI|5.0|This is the best adaptation of the beautiful novel by Charlotte Bronte that is out there at present.  I have seen EVERY version of this movie, and, I must say, this BBC version is the best.  Although some may argue that Timothy Dalton (best performance of his career, the one and only Mr. Rochester for me) is too handsome and Zelah Clarke (she did a very good job, though, she hardly looks 19) is certainly not plain, this is the best pair I have ever seen.  The script is very close to the novel.  The only thing that I thought was a bit underplayed was (Warning: spoiler alert!) the circumstance of Helen Burn's death.  Please, do yourself a favor and get this version if you want the best.
B000059HGY|5.0|I first saw the movie 30 years ago yet I told my family THIS was what I most wanted for Fathers Day. It is one of the 5 best war movies ever made. For one thing, it is one of the few attempts Hollywood has made to make a historically accurate film. However the scenes covering the air attack on Pearl Harbor remain as exciting to watch now as they were 30 years ago despite the fact that none of the current video high technology was available in 1970. After seeing the movie Pearl Harbor,  I appreciate Tora Tora Tora now more than ever.
6304211740|2.0|This is one of the most bitter dissapointments I have ever encountered.  Though the female lead did a very good job, William Hurt is the worst Mr. Rochester that I have seen so far.  The movie misses so many important points that the novel makes, it is really quite disturbing.  The entire relationship between Jane Eyre and the Rivers family is completely missing.  The scenery shots are very pretty, and the costumes are nice, but the content of the movie is very inferior compared to the BBC version with Timothy Dalton.  If you are a true fan of Bronte's novel, please buy the BBC version (1983), it is the best adaptation out there so far.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This movie was great...
630575067X|2.0|The original Star Wars and its sequel were fun movies that played to both adults and kids, handled mature themes in a respectable way (remember the murder of Luke's aunt and uncle?) and held fast to high standards. With &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; these ideals began to weaken. With &quot;The Phanton Menace&quot; they were abandoned completely. The special effects were good (hence the two stars), but that's about it.<br />As an example of the abandonment of the high standards, the stormtroopers of the early movies are replaced in firefights by combat droids. Although this is politically correct, it gives the impression that by the time of the original Star Wars movie technology had regressed, continuity people! Darth Vader in the original movies was a well defined figure of menace. In Phantom Mencae Darth Maul is exactly that, a phantom. He lacks definiton, personality and even menace (he looks ridiculous and fights like Van Dame on a sugar high). In the original movies, the comic relief (R2D2, C3PO) were useful and capable. Jar Jar Binks, the comedy relief from &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; may have been funny in a juvenile way, but he accomplishes nothing. Jeez, if the forces of good rely on guys like him no wonder the empire took over so easily! Previously, the force had been &quot;an energy force that surrounds us and binds the galaxies together.&quot;  In 1976 we were all saying &quot;May the Force be with you.&quot;  Now, thanks to episode I, it turns out the force is a bacterial infection, &quot;May disease be with you?!&quot;  In the original movies, Luke was a kid we could all relate to because he seemed human. In this movie, Annakin Skywalker is an ace pilot, a droid inventor, pilots a fighter in combat, and he's what, 7?!? I can see 7 year olds in the audience cheering for this bit of nonsense, but what about those of us with a cohesive sense of logic? In the films all time low-point, however, Annakin is informed that despite his accomplishments, he is tooold to begin traiing as a jedi. How old do you have to be, a fetus? Luke must have been positively ancient when he began his training. CONITINUITY PEOPLE!<br />Overall, &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; has none of the intelligence, wit or verve of the original movies. It is child-oriented piffle.
078401213X|5.0|This movie is so great, b/c it's so simple (no distracting special effects) but also very stylish and thought provoking.  The soundtrack is great.  The decision to shoot it in high contrast black and white was an excellent one.

B00003CXCS|5.0|THE SOUND OF MUSIC is truly a masterpiece. It's my favorite musical of all time, and one of the best love stories ever told, too. This film takes place during World War II with Maria (Julie Andrews), a young &quot;nun-in-training&quot;, who lives in a church in Austria. Maria is a little clumsy and loves the outdoors. The mother of the church senses that maybe Maria isn't all that happy as a nun being locked up behind the church bars all the time, so she lets Maria go by giving her an assingment: to be the nanny of a retired wealthy sea captain's seven children, whom are very difficult, of course. But Maria ends up winning over the affection of the children by her singing and caring. And, eventually, ends up winning over the stern captain's love - and then marrying him. But then, the Nazis take over Austria and the Von Trapp family must run away from home before the Nazis come and take away Captain Von Trapp. That is when the real adventure and excitement of the film begins.<br />THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a filmed that should be owned and treasured by everyone. Every household should at least have one copy of this truly treasured classic musical. Probably the best musical that ever was. All of the actors are superb in this film, and the music is just enchanting. One viewing of this film and you will remember it (especially the music) for years to come. I don't see how anyone could not like this film. I've watched it countless times on video (I have the older, double-tape version), and will continue to watch it. If you haven't seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC yet then you don't know what you are missing. Buy this DVD today!
0380788624|5.0|If you have read Neal Stephenson before, you know that he writes fast, furious, smart, and smartass. This time the scope is huge. The span is pre-World War II  through today. It is divided into three segments of history and personalities. Although the stories are woven, one story line abruptly ends and another picks up, sometimes when you are really intensely interested in the one you are reading. Some people only like one story line or another, I loved them all. It's long. It's great. Interesting thought-provoking ideas completely played out. Probably my favorite of all times.
6304233639|5.0|Good, old-fashioned Earth-against-the-bugs warfare.   Once again, mankind fights off &quot;unbeatable&quot; odds.   Great special effects, and I liked the way they mixed humor in with &quot;drama&quot;.
0790749815|5.0|&quot;North By Northwest&quot; is a film to be seen AND heard.  <br />Much of Hitchcock's reputation as a genius of suspense is due to his brilliant collaboration with Bernard Herrmann, one of the most important composers of the 20th century.  None other than George Martin, legendary producer of the Beatles, has cited Herrmann's &quot;spikey string arrangements&quot; as a major influence on recordings such as &quot;Eleanor Rigby.&quot;  Imagine, for example, the shower scene from &quot;Psycho&quot; without the terror-inducing, demonic music that accompanies it.  Or think of the bell-tower scene in &quot;Vertigo&quot; without Herrmann's gut-wrenching soundtrack.<br />&quot;North By Northwest&quot; is no exception.  Visually, it is colorful, vibrant, and stylish, but I think it's the MUSIC that carries us through the picture emotionally.  The effect of Cary Grant's &quot;drunk driving&quot; scene is more than doubled by Herrmann's clever score.  Likewise the Mt. Rushmore scene...the visuals are great, but the actual suspense derives significantly from Herrmann's music.  <br />There is an artistic &quot;chemistry&quot; between Hitchcock and Herrmann, as director and composer, rivaled by none save perhaps the partnership of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone (&quot;The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,&quot; &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West,&quot; &quot;The Mission,&quot;).  Together, these men created works more powerful than anything they created separately.      <br />The DVD release of &quot;North By Northwest&quot; is terrific.  The picture is absolutely GORGEOUS, and the soundtrack is crystal clear, allowing Herrmann's score to really stand out.  There is also a fine &quot;making-of&quot; documentary, a music-only feature, and a screenwriter's feature-length commentary.  If you are worried because this isn't part of the fine Universal series of DVD releases, don't be.  Everything here is top-notch.
006441034X|5.0|I just re-read this book for about the twentieth time. And I have to say its one of those stories that is so enjoyable and so imaginative that it belongs in any serious fantasy collection.  Sophie and Howl are some of the most lovable--and most human fantasy characters I've run into in a long time.  When I read this at twelve, I must admit the romance arc of the story completely missed me, now it's one of my favorite parts of the book.  For those not familiar with Diana Wynne Jones or with most British based literature, the style is a little denser than Harry Potter and may take more work to get into, but its worth the effort, believe me.
B0012GMZKE|4.0|New Skin For The Old Ceremony represents the artist's open break with the early folk simplicity of his classic albums Songs Of Leonard Cohen, Songs From A Room and [[ASIN:B000NOKA1W Songs of Love and Hate]] (on which a harder sound already surfaced on tracks like Diamonds In The Mine). It harnesses a wider array of instruments including trombones, viola, banjo, percussion, mandolin, woodwinds and trumpet. Emily Bindiger, Erin Dickins & co-producer John Lissauer contribute backing vocals.<br /><br />This fuller instrumentation with a stronger emphasis on bass and drums, together with a less restrained vocal style, make the sound more varied by taking it closer to the rock tradition. Someone used to the flowing melody lines of the early songs will find e.g. Is This What You Wanted harsh and even dissonant. It is clear that this direction culminated in the Phil Spector-produced [[ASIN:B0012GMVY4 Death of a Ladies' Man]] (1978), a nightmare for the artist but beloved by many.<br /><br />The previous year's live album, [[ASIN:B000007VW5 Live Songs]], display an even greater intensity and raw power on tracks like Please Don't Pass Me By. The themes are the same but the humor is more overt as in Chelsea Hotel, the moving portrait of [[ASIN:0805053948 Janis Joplin]]. Although the tunes are less striking on gentle numbers like I Tried to Leave You & There is a War, the insight and poetic quality of the lyrics are always arresting.<br /><br />His distinct spirituality is much in evidence on tracks like the rocking track Lover Lover Lover, the solemn Take This Longing and the somber Who by Fire, a song inspired by a solemn prayer relating to the concept of the Book of Life with special significance to the [[ASIN:0140502718 High Holy Days]] Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. In a slight tweak, Leonard has modified the chilling finality of the words, shifting the emphasis to the search for the Eternal Divine.<br /><br />Track number four would become the title of the live album [[ASIN:B0012GN1L6 Field Commander Cohen]] recorded on the 1979 tour and released in 2000. So although not all the songs live up to the legendary compositions on his earlier [[ASIN:B00005QZ2J 1960s work]] and some sound rough by comparison, New Skin For The Old Ceremony confirms Cohen's unusual gift for arresting metaphor, intriguing symbolism & imagery layered with allusion.hen]] recorded on the 1979 tour and released in 2000.

What about her achievements live on stage.Not only as a performer was she spectacular but what about achievements in regards to freely moving around stage with the wireless headset.She is a superb buisiness woman with many accolades to her belt .There will never be an artist male or female that could top such a great great artist known as Kate Bush.

B000007RYQ|3.0|This is obviously an intriguing idea, and it's well-imagined by Caine, who manages to take Mahler and place him in unusual contemporary contexts.  However, musically, this is not a complete success.  There is the sense that the musicians have not quite grasped what Mahler is all about just yet, and what they are doing with him.  While technically well-played, there is no great sense of the composers ideas truly being there, and the musicians thus transforming them, as if this was recorded in the middle of a series of rehearsals, but not when the concert time came itself.  But for that concert, you merely have to select the right link . . .
080017948X|4.0|One of my favorite movies - but not enhanced by being on DVD. The only additional material provided is the original theatrical trailer. What? No interview with Bill Murray, Andie McDowell, Chris Elliot? No commentary by Harold Ramis? These opportunites were sadly missed.

These are the top 8 reasons that you absolutely MUST add this album to your collection.  Packed with brilliant lyrics, mind-bending heavy guitars, blistering guitar solos, thundering bass, and earth-shattering drums.  You absolutely must wear your seatbelt when listening to these recordings because you will be blown away by a furious musical frenzy that registers about a 9.0 on the Richter Scale. I can't say enough great things about this album, it still stands as tall today as it did back in '84.  Some of the so called &quot;metal bands&quot; of today need to listen to this music and hear what real metal music sounds like.  Strap yourself in and get ready to &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot;!

0316921173|5.0|A very long book, but alot of fun to read, not to mention brilliantly articulated....  The author takes on an approach to writing that I have not seen elsewhere, and combines that with the story telling of the ebb and flow of everyday life.  With the exception of touchy Canadians, most people who don't mind a long read would enjoy the book and find things that directly related to their lives.  The contrast of characters and plot is exceptional, and sheds some light on some of the best and worst things happening to people in the modern world.  Addiction, relationships (not all men are scum!), perception, and the statue of liberty are only a few of the myriad of topics covered in this hefty book.  Enjoy the reading, but beware of giant rodents and tennis academies!
B00005LMBK|4.0|I bought this cd b/c it was recommended to me. You can't put this cd into one genre. It has a little of everthing:hip hop, jazz, punk, rock..... It's definetly something worthwhile to get if you like new and unusual music.

More! More! More!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|If by the off chance you have never heard of Disney or even seen a Disney movie or your children have not this is the one to start with. The movie is a milestone in animation and it was the first full length animated movie ever made in the US. If you don't want to know the plot of the story skip some of the following sentences. The story is basically this: Once upon a time there lived a girl named Snow White who lived in the castle of her stepmother, The Wicked Queen. The Queen was extremely vain and would always consult her mirror about whether she was the most beautiful woman in the land and as usual the mirror says she is the most beautiful. But then one day he claims that Snow White is the most beautiful and this infuriates the Queen. She hires a huntsman to cut out Snow White's heart and when it comes time to do the job the huntsman cannot do it so he lets Snow White run away into the dark forest. Eventually she finds a cottage in the woods which belongs to seven dwarfs who decide to take her in. But when the Queen discovers Snow White is still alive she decides to go to the cottage in disguise to kill her with a poison apple and that's as far as i go with the synopsis. Even thought it might not be as sophisticated as today's animation, the animation in this movie is very beautiful. The characters are very well animated. The movie also has some fun songs as well like &quot;Heigh Ho&quot;, &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;, etc. While this may be targeted towards kids it is in essence a scary story on their terms. The part of the movie about the poison apple is basically telling kids don't accept things from or talk to strangers. The voices are well done and the music score is very beautiful. One thing though: this movie may turn off some feminists. It is somewhat anti-feminist but the movie is so good that no one might care. As an added note this movie made the AFI's top 100 movies list. So sit back and enjoy Walt Disney's masterpiece.
B00003CXAA|5.0|An incredible drama that develops like no other.  If you are into mob flicks this is the trilogy to see.  True mob/drama lovers will rate this film highly.  There is no other film project like it.<br />Even those not into the mob scene should watch this collection.  The lives of the characters as they unfold are rich and complex.  The character development from beginning to end is realistic and engaging.  Hands down, this is the most incredible saga I have ever watched.<br />I have owned the complete LaserDisc set for several years and look forward to the better picture quality on the DVD, espcially the dark scenes.<br />Buy this collection.

B00000K19E|5.0|Sometimes you just don't know what words to use when you're writing something.  Sometimes you trip over your tongue (or fingers) and just lock up.  I'm not really sure how to begin this review; all that I can say right now is that everybody I know agrees that THE MATRIX is one of the best movies on the planet.<br />At first look, the plot is familiar enough; petty thief turned superhero, has to save the world while fighting giant robots and hacking into computer programs blah blah blah blah blah.  So, if that's the case, why isn't THE MATRIX sitting on the shelves with a ninety percent price reduction like so many other movies?<br />A few words can answer that question.  First, there's uniqueness.  If anybody here can show me one movie like this one, I'll give 'em fifty bucks.  (If they're lucky.)  Don't even think about saying TERMINATOR.  Yes, although both movies feature the same setup, they are NOT at all alike.<br />The second word that comes to mind is action.  With most movies of this genre, yeah, you can probably expect three or maybe even four guys hunkering down with their peashooters and their water pistols and leaning around the corner of that bale of hay which provides them protection from even 12-gages to squeeze off twenty shots at a time without hitting anything.  Not so here, my friends.  In THE MATRIX, yeah, you get plenty of shots of heros and heroines packing a big wallop with twin Uzis.  But you also get shoot-outs with men dodging bullets (for any gamers reading this, think MAX PAYNE), people jumping a hundred yards from on rooftop to another, and hand-to-hand combat like you've never seen before (John Woo did an incredible job).  There's a reason that this movie won awards for the best fight scene of the year.  <br />This superb display of action in other movies might leave little other room for the third and final word which sets THE MATRIX apart: plot.  Yes, it's there all right.<br />Okay, so maybe you've heard this sort of thing before; guy meets old wise guy, old wise guy trains guy to blow the crap out of things with style, young guy with hair problems betrays them, etc.  However, it's the style of writing that sets THE MATRIX apart most of all.  Every character has a personality from Neo, the absolutely amazing hero, Trinity, the big-breasted, Uzi packing heroine, Morpheus (the aforementioned &quot;old wise guy who trains guy to blow the crap out of things&quot;), and Cypher (shudder....).<br />So.  Does THE MATRIX live up to its praise?  Yes.  Does it break new ground in its genre?  Oh yes.  Should you buy it?  Hmmm, let's think about this for a moment.<br />Heck yes.
B000002UB3|5.0|By 1969 the Beatles were drifting further and further apart.  They had just finished up the wildly uneven LET IT BE and Lennon and McCartney seemed to be constantly quarreling over the future of the fab four.  Everbody thought that the band was over when suddenly the band exploded out of nowhere with their final album(that they recorded, Let It Be was released a few months after Abbey Road's release).  Despite the dissension the Beatles final album was a great group effort and by far one of their best albums.<br />Abbey Road is split into to two parts.  One part being a collection of eight excellent songs and the other part being an awesome lengthly rock medley!  COME TOGETHER opens the album which is one of the bands most memorable rockers.  Followed by the beatiful Harrison love song SOMETHING.  Next is the novelty tune MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER then OH DARLING which brings out the wild rock voice of McCartney.  After that is OCTOPUS'S GARDEN one of Ringo's finest compositions.  Next is the lengthly I WANT YOU (SHE'S SO HEAVY) which has a killer guitar riff!  After that is the awesome HERE COMES THE SUN one of Harrison's best tunes and one of my favourite Beatle tunes!  Finally the eight wonderful songs finish with  the harmonic BECAUSE.  <br />The medley consists of nine songs all linked together.  It begins with the emotional YOU NEVER GIVE ME YOUR MONEY then moves into the peaceful SUN KING.  Things pick up with MEAN MR.MUSTARD, POLYTHENE PAM, and SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW.  Things get passionate with GOLDEN SLUMBERS, and CARRY THAT WEIGHT.  The album wraps up with the rockin' THE END.  But really finishes up with HER MAJESTY a cheeky acoustic bit by McCartney.<br />In conclusion Abbey Road is a 2 part musical monument on one disc.  Featuring excellent drumming by Ringo, passionate vocals by Paul,  excellent guitar work by George, and excellent songwriting from John.  Yet each member contributes awesome songwriting anyway.  Many consider this the best Beatle album and in my opinion it is very true. It ranks one of my three top favourite Beatle albums.  This album has really aged well and sounds fresh even today.  Get this album you will not be disappointed!  It is one of the greatest records I have ever heard!  It should be in every household!  Highly recommended!
B00000IQCF|5.0|I've seen all of Aldomovar's films, and I'd have to put this one right behind &quot;All About My Mother.&quot;  It has the typical Aldomovar intersecting characters &amp; some of his trademark campiness, but the polish and professionalism that burst out in &quot;All About My Mother&quot; really started in &quot;Live Flesh,&quot; his work prior to that Oscar-winning breakthrough.<br />Not mentioned in any of the other reviews here is the reason I rented the film: a chance to see Javier Bardem before his triumph as Reinaldo Arenas in Julian Schnabel's &quot;Before Night Falls.&quot;  That alone is worth your checking out this movie.  Watching Live Flesh,&quot; you gain even more respect for his depiction of Arenas.  He demonstrates amazing range.  There is a gaping chasm between these two characters.  Just incredible acting.<br />[Trivia note:  You can check out one of Bardem's first film appearances in an earlier Aldomovar picture called &quot;High Heels.&quot;  He's on screen for no more than seven seconds as a TV stage technician.]
6303109950|5.0|TOMBSTONE must rank as one of the best westerns in the post-Peckinpah/Leone era.  This is due to many of the traditional elements that made the western genre a uniquely American genre, not to mention the disillusionment that the characters in Peckinpah's and Leone's films felt.<br />This film focuses on legendary Kansas lawman Wyatt Earp who hopes to stick with retirement from law enforcement by journeying with his brothers (Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton) to the Arizona mining town of Tombstone, along with Wyatt's good friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer).  The trouble is, however, Tombstone is a practically lawless place.  And when a group of outlaws known as the Cowboys begin to turn Tombstone's streets red with the blood of innocent people, the stage is set--not merely for the celebrated gunfight at the O.K. Corral, but the revenge that comes after Paxton is killed and Elliott wounded.<br />Much has been made of Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and he certainly does a lot with the role.  I myself think that the real star is the often underrated Russell, who looks virtually like a dead ringer for Wyatt Earp.  So often, Russell's talents were underutilized by filmmakers.  Here, he really shows his mettle as an actor.  Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn, as the head honchos of the Cowboys, make for incredible heavies; and the legendary Charlton Heston has a cameo as well.<br />Well directed by George Cosmatos (RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART 2), scored by Bruce Broughton, and excellently photographed by William Fraker (BULLITT) on Arizona locations, TOMBSTONE is a must-see western, proof that there is still life in this genre if only Hollywood would return to it more often.
B000003BEM|5.0|I'm one of the few Stones fans who think their WORST period was the 1960's. They only finally started to get good with this album. But they got great. All their amateurish, pimply-faced sound is behind them with this album. If you're a musical snob, you won't like the fact that the songs are embarrasingly simple. Three major chords, and a forth or fifth thrown in here and there. But that's rock and roll. I like simple. And their simple compositions have MEAT on them. I don't think they've ever beat STRAY CAT BLUES (which, as Mick has confessed, is a rip-off, soundwise, of the Velvet Underground's song HEROIN). A great album of blues, country and rock. No one can play American music better than a bunch of ugly English blokes!
B000009QPE|5.0|This is where it all began.  90% of metal bands out today (excluding (c)rap metal) owe at least a little homage to this masterpiece of thrash metal.  Death metal owes its speed, heaviness, and content (even though DM speed is faster, riffs heavier, and content more explicit, during its era RIB was mindblowing), thrash owes this its many imitated riffs, and most of all, metal owes this album its blazing ferocity.  This album contains guitar legends(largely thanks to this album) Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman shreding your speaker with powerful riffs, Dave Lombardo giving one of the best percussion performances EVER, and last but certainly not least is bassist/vocalist Tom Araya screaming his satanic venom.  From the opening wail on &quot;Angel of Death&quot; through his demand to enter Satan's realm on &quot;Altar of Sacrafice,&quot; Araya's vocal performance leaves nothing to be desired.  This album is so influencial and ahead of its time that now, in the year 2001, the material on here is as fresh as it was on its release date.  I listen to this album religiously and it never sounds dated and always keeps me wanting more at its finish.  This is one of the, if not THE best metal album ever made, and every metalhead should have this in their collection.
0345349571|5.0|As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I recognize a finely written story when I read one.  Barbara Tuchman's A DISTANT MIRROR tells a magnificent story.  The story told in A DISTANT MIRROR is one of a calamitous century.  There is a Hundred Year War interrupted by brief periods of uneasy peace.  There is a mysterious plague attacking people some view as being morally culpable for their illness.  There is religious strife in all corners of civilization.  There are massacres of people of the Jewish faith.  There is the rich living in unbelievable comfort while the poor live exploited lives that are brutish, miserable, and short.  No, A DISTANT MIRROR does not deal (at least directly) with the last century; it deals with the Fourteenth Century.  It is a brilliant work by a brilliant historian.  It is one of my favorite popular history works.
0780626966|5.0|This is THE best collection for the NOES movies. [Heck], it's the best collection of any movies. The digital quality is awesome, as with any DVD. And the Bonus Disk is awesome too. But NOES2 should just be completely forgotten in the bad horror movies land. It stunk. but anyway, I am like, the biggest Freddy Fan, so email me if you just want to talk about the series.
0743420373|5.0|&quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; by authors Stanley and Danko was inspirational, refreshing, and well written.  It eloquently depicted throughout the entire book the true significance of the proverb &quot;Live within your means not within your wants.&quot;  This book provides a canvas that covers a wide spectrum of readers from teenagers to grandparents.  The book was comprised of eight chapters and three appendixes.  These chapters were documented and analyzed using insights, examples, interviews, and surveys.  <br />It was astonishing to find that American millionaires have so much drama within their lives, just as normal Americans.  The authors took time to investigate, interview, and layout the seven denominators that were conducive to accumulating money.  These factors benefit anyone who takes the time to read this book.  Only the readers can articulate and evaluate the true meaning of these factors for themselves.  <br />The heart and pulse of the book was chapter seven, which was entitled Affirmative Action, Family Style.  The reader will enjoy reading this chapter; it is filled with drama and meaningful insights as well as life lessons.  <br />The context of the book can be best summarized by the quote \\"Most people have it all wrong about wealth in America.  Wealth is not the same as income.\\"  I think this book will enhance and inform our society and in particular our young adult population within America regarding the wealthy.  <br />The readers should realize that this book was written after two decades of studying, researching, and compiling data regarding affluent Americans.  The authors excavated the essential knowledge of affluent Americans.  The readers will gain much insight and experience from this book regarding accumulating an affluent lifestyle.
B00005M989|4.0|This is a nice collection of hits, but there's a few things I didn't like about it. You see--Trust, Dirty Mind, Thunder, Pop Life, Sexy M.F., Nothing Compares 2 U, Batdance, If I Was Your Girlfriend, 7, P Control, Partyman, Controversy, Head, and a slew of others are missing. Now, if this is the very best of Prince, how come some real gems like these are out, while a song as lame as Money Don't Matter 2 Night makes the cut? I'm only a casual Prince fan myself, but even I recognize where a double CD would be needed to cover a twenty-plus year epic career.
0440234743|5.0|This was my first Grisham book, so I can't compare it to his others.  But I do know that I couldn't put it down!  The plot has plenty of attention-keeping twists, the characters are entertaining, and the &quot;moral of the story&quot; was great.<br />What was the story?  Without giving things away, it's about a multi-billionaire who, at the eleventh hour, writes his leechy family out of his will and writes his long-lost, illegitimate daughter in.  The former fight for their inheritance and the latter, who is a tribal missionary, is indifferent.  Any more hints would be too many...<br />Definitely a worthwhile read!
B00003CWL6|4.0|I didn't quite know what to expect before viewing American Beauty. Having seen a trailer for the film, I expected it to concentrate heavily on the character of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). I suppose it does - Spacey, one of cinema's great actors, dominates the film. The relationships between the other main characters both add and detract from the success of the film. Particularly strong performances from Burnham's neighbours (British spelling!) - the ultimate disfunctional family headed by Colonel Frank Fitts US Marine Corps (as Chris Cooper regularly introduces himself), father to drug dealing son Ricky (Wes Bentley) and husband of sorts to depressed Barbara (Allison Janney). The Colonel despises gays, owns an original piece of Nazi cutlery and takes every opportunity to express his dominance. His son secretely videos the Burnham family home, especially Lester Burnham's teenage daughter Jane (Thora Burch). The pair eventually meet and gradually fall in love. I use the word gradually deliberately. Their relationship is one of the film's weaker points. Their subplot is ponderous and could have been dropped altogether without harming the film.  Meanwhile, Spacey's character transforms himself from a subserviant, meek door mouse, dominated by his extravert wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), into a carefree devil-may-care guy who quits his job, sells his sensible family car to buy a cool classic, the car of his dreams. The catalyst of this transformation is his daughter's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Survari), who he meets and immedialtely lusts over. When she returns his affection, Lester begins working out, turning his garage into a private gym, until he realises that they can never consumate their relationship.  American Beauty is a fun ride, mainly thanks to the charismatic Spacey. Lester Burnham does what many people would love to do - trade security for freedom before it's too late. It's not a perfect film and was perhaps fortunate to win so many Oscars, but it's wellworth watching and includes another great Kevin Spacey performance.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|We are among the first in line at the theater-release of a Disney movie.  I was skeptical of this movie, not being familiar with the plot, but I was not prepared for the emotional tour-de-force that awaited me.  A strong heroine, comedic relief (provided by Eddie Murphy and Harvey Fiernstein) and a powerful film score (Jerry Goldsmith) combine to make this the most thrilling Disney movie since &quot;Hunchback.&quot;<br />5 incredibly exciting stars!
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorillaz is definitely one of the better bands I have heard lately.  Their style is slick and experimental, slow but still easy to listen to.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Plus, if you're not sure, go to their website and liten to basically the entire album online!  Plus you get to check out 2 videos.  The band is out there and ready to be discovered.  As someone else said before, thank god for MTV2!
1559409002|4.0|My take on Carnival of Souls:  The artistic photography shows real insight and ability, the generally excellent Hilligoss performance is mesmerizing, and I think Sidney Berger, Frances Feist and Art Ellison perfectly fulfill their roles.  The minor characters are just acting like folk from small town Kansas (or Utah), so don't expect Lee Strasberg graduates.  The Gene Moore score is a custom fit, as is the Saltair setting.  The script is lightweight in many spots...the idea that the dead could inhabit a different dimension, side-by-side with the living is depicted visually more than by pointless banter.  There are some rough spots with jumpy editing and below par dubbing, and the pace is not intended for a viewer wanting Indiana Jones entertainment.  But when viewed as a series of parts that may be greater than the whole, &quot;Carnival&quot; is just an amazing, above average, low budget underdog saved from oblivion because enough people...intellectuals and commoners saw there was something different, something not of the commonplace in this film.  I recommend the Critereon DVD edition with crystal clear picture...its way better than previous VHS editions.
B00004LN16|4.0|Okay--no new ground is broken here, but we didn't expect it to be anyway.  There will never be another &quot;Back In Black&quot;, but that's what will always make that album one of the alltime special albums in rock history.  That doesn't mean this still doesn't rate with other  AC/DC efforts.  As numerous others have indicated, one of AC/DC's trademarks is consistency, and there is no exception here.  The title track is a great rocker to lead off the album, and &quot;Meltdown&quot; keeps the pace going early in the album.  The other track I have heard on the radio off this album is &quot;Satellite Blues&quot;, which is a standout, rocking track.  A few of the tracks are more average, but all are more than listenable for longtime fans.  As with virtually any AC/DC album, you really can't go wrong with this one.
0380778556|4.0|This book was so well-written.  I had to read it as a summer reading book for school, and I enjoyed it so much.  It has a touch of mystery, and much suspense.<br />I only wish there was a sequel to this beautiful book, I would read it immediately.
0812548094|5.0|In SOT, Terry Goodkind picks up where WFR left off -- and with no slackening of the pace. Just when everybody is getting all warm and gushy inside over the victories of the previous book, we come to find that the solution to the last book's problem has become the problem now in the second book of this series. While many would rather skip some of the rather graphic details, I find it rather refreshing for once to be told what is happening instead of the events being merely alluded to.<br />Again, another highly detailed body of work that is extremely hard to put down, as was the previous opus. You simply can't just wait to see what happens next, and I know I've spent several nights up late rereading this novel.
B0000508U6|4.0|Se dice que Live quiere parecerse tanto a REM, que termina REM pareciéndose a Live. Casi todos los críticos especializados coinciden en lo mismo con Coldplay y Radiohead. Parachutes, el primer disco oficial de los ingleses Coldplay, es seguramente una de las mejores producciones musicales que vieron luz en el 2000. Quizás, la única canción que tiene alguna similitud con sus paisanos ingleses es \\"Shiver\\", muy similar al Radiohead de los tiempos de The Bends, a mediados de los años 90'. <br />Aquello de ponerle \\"Cold\\" al nombre del grupo no es juego. El piano gélido a cargo de su cantante Chris Martin, suena incesantemente en casi todas las canciones y es el gran congelador donde se enfrían las diez melodías de este disco. Pero el termostato que regula la temperatura para que no morir de hipotermia es la voz de Chris Martin, la guitarra de Jon Buckland; el bajo de Guy Berriman y la batería de Will Champion que construyen las bases para que levites con la música y puedas ver y sentir todo desde un nivel superior. <br />Cuando se escucha por primera vez a Chris Martin, no se sabe ciencia cierta a quién suena, pero con seguridad trae recuerdos muy recientes: podrían ser Chris Cornell, Dave Matthews y/o Thom Yorke (sobre todo cuando hace las insistentes-y-demasiado-repetidas falsetas), entre otros. Sin embargo, la voz de este cantante, termina convirtiéndose en casi un eco retumbante, que se pasea en el límite de lo agrio y lo dulce, lo acústico y lo eléctrico, pero lleno de potencia.<br />Las guitarras de este disco no son totalmente rockeras ni distorsionadas. Ni siquiera existen acordes completos. Coldplay prefiere cambiarlos por pequeños arpegios que le van dando el brillo, la sencillez y melancolía a cada canción. Que no por melancólicas llegan a ser tristes; todo lo contrario. En Parachutes predomina una esperanza \\"in crescendo\\" que llega a su clímax en \\"Everything's not lost\\", al final del disco.<br />Coldplay consigue con Parachutes un discosubliminal, insinuado y sugerido. En silencio y en estado de relax, se puede sentir cómo canciones como \\"Troubles\\" retumban desde lo más profundo, y sin darse cuenta se termina cantando solo a toda volumen. Inevitablemente, todo el mundo se le quedará viendo y pensará que está loco. Disfrútelo.<br />Cada canción de Parachutes es la típica que se escucha una vez y se queda pegada en la cabeza para siempre. Así, el único remedio será rotarla con \\"We Never Change\\" o \\"Sparks\\", otras dos joyas de esta placa. <br />En fin, ¿cómo es Parachutes? Es como estar muy relajado, acostado en la cama y contemplando las estrellitas fosforescentes del techo por horas y horas, con una sonrisa en los labios de satisfacción.
B00003CXN4|1.0|After all the hype I had expected far more. The sub plots of each of the stories were so poorly captured that they became meaningless. The &quot;documentary&quot; style failed miserably and even the ambitious photography failed to hold the Tijuana scenes together  For me the only remotely interesting area was Michael Douglas' role as the Drug Watchdog who struggled to save his addicted daughter . Unfortunately even this story became muddled and failed to take advantage of a good opportunity give us real meat in the story.  In another of the parallel stories, Miss Zeta Jones' souless acting added an additional burden to a story that  lacked all credibility.  Across the board, the few interesting plot elements were treated so sublty as to be lost. In summary this was a movie that lacked direction and took way too much time to go nowhere. <br />All in all a waste of time - I am sorry I wasted my money
B000003RCY|5.0|This is in my opinion, Rammstein's Greatest CD, So far. Its their most heavy, and angry album. If you listen to this CD, then the other 2, Sehnsucht and Mutter, you notice the extreme changes, they're more melodic, and less [ticked]-off-sounding than Herzeleid. If anyone out there knows the translations to the songs, you notice the morbid, almost disturbing lyrics, those of you who do, you know what I'm talking about. The style of the music of the album is blunt with a very precise rhythm section, and crunching duel-guitars, courtesy of Paul and Richard. The vocals on this album are monotonous, which isn't a bad thing, it still sounds great, Till sings on some songs, like the Ballad, Seemann, but for most of the album, it sounds like he is mostly talking, which goes well with the blunt, to-the-point sound of the band. Added into the mix are the Keyboards, which give it an industrial edge. This is not only my favorite Rammstein album, Its one of my favorite albums over-all. Favorite songs: Wollt Ihr das Bett in Flammen Sehen, Weisses Fliesch, Herzeleid, Laichzeit.
B00005K3OT|4.0|A movie like this is all about the senses. Sight, sound, smell and especially taste. Chocolat is used as a metaphor for everyone's guilty pleasures. At first, everyone in the village appears to have a normal, happy life. But we soon discover that things are not always what they appear to be. The happiness is just a cover-up for what greater problems lie underneath. Chocolat comes into the village and uncovers the real problems with the inhabitants. Some of the subtlties in the movie aren't so subtle. All the townspeople wearing plain, muted colored clothing. Then Vianne and her daughter enter the village wearing bright red cloaks. Vianne is always wearing a red-colored outfit, marking her as different from the townspeople as possible. And her opening up a chocolatier during Lent and tempting the otherwise steadfast followers of the mayor and priest only exagerates the tension between them. The actors give good performances but the best is by Alfred Molina as the mayor. His wife has left him but he refuses to admit to it. So instead he attempts to control everyone else in town. But Vianne enters and threatens his control. He fears losing them as he did his wife. In the end we are to embrace one another for what we have to offer and not what lack. It's a basic moral to the story, told simply enough that even younger children could understand what the movie is trying to say.
B00005KHJR|5.0|I have seen this movie twice and love it. The soundtrack (featuring Todd Alan and many more) is awesome. As a film representing the pagan community, it is more accurate than modern representations. Well, until the ending of the film that is. But, I can't explain why the ending does not maintain the standards without giving the movie away. However, I think that the movie is quite amusing- just read the quotes page on amazon.
6301967992|5.0|I remember when I was a child and this film was on television. Even the beginning with the blood dripping on the screen with the hypnotizing music told me this was going to be scary. I was mesmorized by everything I could see and hear, and it was quite scary, but also funny enough to not take it too seriously. I was probably around 10 and never forgot this film. I can't quite put my finger on it, but you have to see this film to understand the scary undertones, when you see the outside sequences with a perfect score, it sends chills sometimes, and the professor and Alfred, they were perfectly cast (yes, even though it was Roman's film, he was perfect in his role, innocent, curious and sweet). It had a number of eye openers for me, as the starring of breasts, which honestly, as men, we all do sometimes, and to find out what a gay person was. That was strange for me but even though I didn't like that part, I was too young to understand it, but I sure loved the beautiful women in it. The way it was shot is astounding, the lighting and the darkness perfectly matched, and I always wondered about the count's assistant, real or make-up, you be the judge, but ouf, scary! 30 years later, I'm still that little boy watching this movie like it was the first time, and to me, it will probably be one of the best horror films ever, because of all the right elements, and it also made me laugh, thank goodness. If Roman Polanski had wanted, he could have done a real scary movie out of this. It scares enough to bug you, but it's the innocence you never forget.
B00004U8P4|1.0|&quot;Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; is horrible, suffering from a really bad case of sequelitis. Jeff Goldblum admirably reprises his role as Ian, and the stunning redhead Julianne Moore as his girlfriend, but no more characters in the sequel from the first one(excepting the Dr. Hammond and his two grandchildren reprising brief roles).<br />Spielberg has crafted stunning special effects into the raptors, tyrannosaurus, and some exhilarating suspenseful moments-but that's all to enjoy. The second one is far too serious and weak in the script. If more breathtaking and the characters taken less seriously, this would make an okay sequel.<br />&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and the 3rd sequel, &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; are admirably better than the second one, which takes itself far too seriously and just gives too many lame excuses for people being eaten by the dinos. <br />If you had a choice to buy the second or the third movie, when it comes out on DVD and VHS, buy the third one, if you hadn't bought the second movie already. It's more enjoyable and more thrilling than the second one. <br />Spielberg, you can do much, MUCH better than THIS. This is HORRIBLE.<br />Rated PG-13 for extreme terror violence/gore and mild language.
B000002LCK|5.0|If you had to buy just one album from New Order this would have to be it. Much better than The Best of New Order, this has ALL of the best songs released in their original form; in addition, you get all of the B-sides, which are like completely new songs in their own right. Whether you are considering buying this album because it has Blue Monday, Bizarre Love Triangle, or True Faith--or even if you already have all of New Order's other albums--you will love ALL of Substance. I cannot recommend it enough; any fan of 80's music, Techno, or Synthpop MUST have this album, it's an essential addition to your collection. New Order's Substance is definitely five-stars.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|this is good. this is just a very well written rock album, to put it bluntly.  few bands manage to capture raw power, energy and intensity as well as these guys do.  this band showcases great musical flair and energy easily as well as Rage, Nirvana, and Refused.  even when the music slows down, there's still tension there to bring something to the experience so you're never let down.  This band doesn't write terribly complicated pieces of music, it's just that it's well written. the way the afore mentioned bands write music, but it's enough their own style to not call them a bunch of posers trying to be something that already exists.  This band focuses on the political, and while i do have a big interest in politics, i seldom care to hear what some band has to say(who usually are leaning hard toward the left).  Or at least i think it's about politics.  it sounds enough like it is. i haven't totally checked on it to make sure, but the point is is that the Bixler sings with a great amount of conviction and charisma.  this stuff can really move you when it gets going, especially on 'invalid litter dept.'.  you can't not react to this music. it's just that good.  the only problems that bother me with the album, are that the singer can often sound like a combination between Zack from Rage and Serj from System of A Down.  but is that really a bad thing? and besides, once you get the full effect you can tell that he has enough of his own stye to call this his own thing.  the other thing that slightly bothers me about this album is that occasionally the music seems to clutter together and get rather messy(squealy guitars and such..). but the messiness kind of works for the band and can be found as part of the appeal, since they play enough of the album clearly so you can tell that the band knows what they're going for, though sometimes i questioned it.  in short, this is just a good rock album. dont' pass it up.  this band has a great range and great energy, a 'moving' musical experience if i do say so myself...
B00005ASOC|5.0|Finding Forrester was a very well done film. The transformation of William Forrester (played by Sean Connery) really connected with me.<br />The key was friendship with a kid from the neighorhood Jamal Wallace, who helps get him unstuck. It was believable because we all get stuck sometimes and help comes from the most unsuspecting corners of our life. You can't help feeling that they both help each other but it is Jamal who saves Forrester's life. He energizes Forrester. Helps him find his spirit and vitality once again.<br />Instead of the old man instilling wisdom upon the young man, it is the young one that predominately helps the old one find himself and his inherent genius once again. This is a good twist that allows the movie stand on its own apart from the inevitable comparisions to Good Will Hunting.<br />The writing and basketball are a good combination and neither is overdone. The story even mirrors the acting careers of each of the two main characters. Jamal, like the actor who plays him, is a newcomer who has burst onto the scene. Forrester, like Connery, is nearing the end of his life but bounces back to be able to do his best work again. A sparkling performance by the Scotsman Connery and could be entered into his already long list of outstanding performances.<br />The scenes between Jamal and Claire show a great restraint that add, not take away, from the relationship between the two. Aren't we all a mystery to each other? The greatness in this side of the story is in the unspoken and unexpressed. Their love is a budding flower just beginning. This movie was masterfully done.
B000000HTL|5.0|Many people regard Pawn Hearts as their ultimate masterpiece, but for me, it's H to He. Not only do I think this is Van der Graaf's best, but one of the best progressive rock albums ever! Especially with such great cuts as &quot;Killer&quot;, &quot;Emporer in his War Room&quot; and &quot;Pioneers Over C&quot;. There is even some spacy tendencies in the Hammond organ departmant. I remembered after a few listens just being nothing short of amazed by the album, I could hardly believe what I was hearing. The music here is truly a powerful listening experience, and it's little wonder why this is included on my Desert Island Discs. It's also hard to believe how much the band evolved in one short year (and three albums released)! The Aerosol Grey Machine shows the band just starting, recording mostly song-oriented numbers. The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other finds the band recording a more progressive album, but you can tell that greater music was just around the corner, and H to He fulfilled that promise. If you're a lover of quality progressive rock, you should not go without this album!
B00005K3O4|5.0|Killer Klowns struck me by its lost innocence, the way those clowns looked in their suits, it was a very nice outfit. They really made me get lost in their stupid plot, I was conused, yet I Wanted to see more. I watched this movie time and time again when I was little, I thought I would never see it again until I delibrately stumbled upon this place. I never thought my dream would be fulfilled of finding this movie, and I felt my heart sink I had found it, but the music video was not displayed on the dvd. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to sit out another long day and wait for another long night. I don't know what I'm talking about, all I know is this movie is pretty bad, I mean seriously don't watch it or you'll laugh bad. But, still I find myself drawn to it b/c I loved it so much when I was younger, so I give it 5 stars for it's sentimental purpose, and the way it holds on to you.
B000002VCZ|2.0|At this point in their career, it's very obvious that the Alan Parsons Project was trying to update their sound for the mid 1980s, digital synthesizers (DX-7, for example) and drum machines. Unfortunately they were really beginning to play it safe, in fact too safe. Most of it sounds like anonymous pop. What progressive was left over on their previous release, Ammonia Avenue (like the title track) is pretty much gone here. Even the instrumental &quot;Hawkeye&quot; isn't much to write home about, in my book. Of course, by this time, the band had no more hits. You don't find a single song on this album that gets regular radio airplay. It's plain to see that the album sounds quite stale and they've ran out of fresh ideas. I Robot, on the other hand, is the sound of the Alan Parsons Project with fresh ideas and much better music. They weren't playing it safe in '77 and I like that very much. So if you're a diehard fan of the APP, of course, Vulture Culture will be part of your collection, but if you thought they started losing their freshness after their first three to five albums, skip this one.
B00001NFCY|2.0|I didn't like this c.d. too much.... just get the single to &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;With arms wide open&quot;...... the other songs are pretty dumb. &quot;Beutifull&quot; is okay......
B00003CWTI|5.0|I was told about this movie and figured \\"what the heck\\" but am I glad to have seen this movie.<br />The movie start out with characters living their own lives and cleverly weaves them all together eventually leading to this weird ending. It's a movie that tries to show the inner emotions of people and how they deal with it.<br />BUT!! - This is the kind of movie that you'll either LIKE or HATE. If you're not into the profound, weird movies, I don't think you'll like this movie. I personally think it's a great movie.
0446608955|5.0|This book was recomended to me by a close friend (who was still crying when she gave it to me by the way).  &quot;It's just the best book ever!&quot; she said with tears running down her cheeks.  I asked her what it was about.  When she told me it was about a popular teenage boy falling in love with a nerdy girl, I thought to myself, &quot;Oh great, this sounds like another one of those badly written teenage romance novels!&quot;  Still, I decided to read it.  I took it home and that night.  By the end of the first chapter, I was hooked.  It is totally different from any book I have ever read!  It is from the perspective of a 17 year old boy named Landon who must have had a GREAT sense of humor, because within that first chapter, I found myself laughing out lound by the little interesting thoughts of his added into the story (who would have guessed by the end I would be crying my brains out!)  Landon finds himself falling for Jamie, the overly-perfect(not to mention over-religous, nice, and cheerful) minister's daughter.  Landon finds himself as he falls into a deeper love than some people will ever know.  By the way, the endng is REALLY good and gets you thinking.  This novels pulls on your every emotion.  I laughed, I cried!  Sparks has outdine himself again!
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Simply put, and IMHO, this is the greatest sounding audio recording ever released in the Pop/Rock category. The quality, even after 16 years, is unmatched. If you are a true Audiophile, you already own it. Whenever I upgrade my 'gear', I come back to this recording, and enjoy it all over again. You should too.
B000059ZLH|4.0|Dream Theater is probably the best band in the planet, but that's not the point. Pros:  The band's performance is excellent.  Video quality is the best i've ever seen on a live performance (sharp and colorful).  It includes full versions of Metropolis 2 and Change of Seasons, plus a small bunch of other songs. Cons:  Audio quality is so poor I though I was listening to a VHS tape.  Even if it's a live recording, it could have sounded a lot better, since musicians performance is flawless. If you are a DT fan, this is a piece you MUST have in your collection, but don't expect too much: Metropolis2 Audio CD sounds a thousand times better. If you are not a DT fan and you want to know them, it's a worth buy, but better buy the CD albums.
B00003CWN3|4.0|Although it was somewhat hard to watch at times, I found it to be a beautiful film. I thought it would be a deppresive film, but it is not. Disturbing, maybe, but beautiful.   By the way, the actress named Chloe something, that played Lana, is great in the film.

B00003CXRM|5.0|INCREDIBLE. The acting was mesmerizing and totally entertaining. I was totally suprised.George Cloony totally suprised and enchanted me.Loved it.
0399146253|2.0|I can only but agree with previous reviewers - I have quit reading this book and will think twice before picking up another Cornwell novel.  Over the last few years, her characters have become people I do not wish to know.  Their lives are too disturbing, too dark, too seedy.  After reading &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; for a couple hours, I was in a depressed state and felt the need to take a shower.  Her books are no longer entertaining and fun to read.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek has grossed over 260 million in the theaters (as of Aug. 14, 2001). That's within .05% of the top grossing animation of all times, Toy Story (@ 262 million). Shrek is a great 3D movie. The 3D computer animation is second, only to Final Fantasy. The story is more involving than what I expected. The voices were well cast and performed. The whole film awsome. I'm sure you're aware of that or you wouldn't be reading this now. It has both adult (clean adult) and kids humor. The writers plagerized just about everyone and it was hilarious.   Okay, now for the DVD. This DVD is created as 2 parts. One disc is aimed for the kids and the format is \\"full Screen\\" (pan & scan) and includes 17 DVD-ROM games. The other disc is geared more for adults and is letterbox formatted. Both discs have 3 minutes of extended ending that was never scene in the theatrical release. There's 'Making Of' and 'Behind The Scenes'. It encludes 11 hours of extras. There are also running commentaries. This DVD will actually allow you to replace a charector's voice with you own with \\"Sherk's Revoice Studio\\" effects. There are 15 minutes of newly animated footage specifically for the DVD interactive menues.. . . . . Shall I go on? . . . There is a sticker on EVERY box saying it's a winner. Each box has eligebility to win a prize, from a Kia car to X-Box game consoles to Baskin Robins Ice cream.   So, we have a fantastic movie, the most massive extras features ever on a DVD, and free give-aways.  And yould be nuts not to take advantage of this offer.
B000002AH9|5.0|As I've read through some of the other reviewers' comments, I was surprised in a way to see that they mimic my own views about &quot;Lady in Satin.&quot; It's haunting beauty can only be truly appreciated if you have an understanding of Lady Day's life. She lived only another 17 months after this recording, which was said to be her personal favorite. Recorded in 1958 w/ the accompaniment of Ray Ellis &amp; His Orchestra, her voice is obviously quivery a majority of the time; much unlike her silky-threaded vocals of times past. I think the heartfelt emotion in her voice on this recording is so moving, you can't help but feel some of it yourself. She was singing her heart out, or maybe it was 'crying her heart out.' Once you come to realize this, you gain a true appreciation of her effort. She gave it all that she had! When someone gives of themself totally, regardless of the quality, it is a beautiful thing; Especially when that someone is struggling. &quot;Lady in Satin&quot; is a masterpeice of emotion!<br />With the most unique voice of all time, Billie Holiday has often been referred to as 'The First Lady of Jazz.' Although this cd doesn't have a real 'jazzy-feel' w/ the orchestral accompaniment, it's still jazzy; You just hear it in her voice. Everything about her was jazz. This is one of my most favorite Lady Day albums. (I also really like Strange Fruit, from 1937). There are alternate studio takes included on this remastered recording. It's really neat to &quot;be apart&quot; of those retakes, hearing the background nosies of the studio and so forth. The cd liner is full of great old photos from the studio...w/Billie, Ray Ellis &amp; producer Irving Townsend. Lots of interesting info included in the notes too. A liner section written by Ray Ellis, himself, is touching. Sadly, such a talented singer like Billie Holiday lived a very painful, sad life. She paved the way for 'honest music,' in many respects (just listen to Strange Fruit). She also wrote an autobiography that would compliment this cd. If you aren't familiar w/ her life, it would be worth your time to research it. I consider &quot;Lady in Satin&quot; to be a timeless piece of history. It's very poignant. Definitly add it to your collection!
B00003OSSL|4.0|Unusual and fresh, Pollack manages to find a story that doesn't follow the predictable hollywood storylines.  In respect to the acting both Kristen (who I had only seen once before in a minor role in Mission Impossible and was stabbed-to-death no less) and Harrison, who I always seem to see as an old Han Solo (Sorry Harrison), did a respectible job as Dutch and Kay; however, the real star of the show is, again, the story. There is a captivating aspect to it that I could not identify and managed to keep my interest up throughout.<br />Dutch (a D.C. Internal Affairs cop) and Kay(a U.S. Congresswoman from New Hampshire who is seeking re-election) would have led completely separate lives if it hadn't had been for the plane that crashed with both their spouses aboard, in seats 3A &amp; B, first-class.<br />The betrayal of Dutch's spouse bewilders him such that he becomes obsessed with finding out all he can about the circumstances surrounding her ill-fated choice to have an affair.  This obsession brings him smashing into Kay's delicately balanced world and threatens her carefully crafted public and private lives with scandal.  <br />I will agree some of the acting isn't all that great, the bar scene at 'The Tides' felt canned.  Its also true that Harrison Ford appears to have only a few expressions, but they always seem to have a special quality about them that make you want to see them again; furthermore its apparent he doesn't know what to do with his hands, they seem to jerk from one position to the next. (ex:car bottom-squeezer scene)<br />Kristen, though not as accomplished an actress as some would like, seems to have a special quality about her as well. Furthermore, she is one of the most elegant leading ladies I have encountered in a long while.  I will admit some of her lines seemed to be pre-recorded and came a little to quickly. (re: tides bar).  Perhaps she just needed to internalize her lines better, or its the result of having to manage the american accentwhich slipped from time to time into a strange quasi american - quasi british accent.  Though she did manage the accent well enough for me to enjoy the movie.<br />In summary, its a good film if you like unconventional flicks, and I would certainly recommend it.  Which is unusual because I don't particulary like actor/director movies, but Sydney Pollack is apparently accomplished at both, and the fact that he relegated himself to a relatively minor role mitigated the issue as well.<br />The other reviews I have read seem to either be &quot;Love It&quot; or &quot;Hate It&quot;, So to remain within these paramaters I would say I love this film, but its definitely only puppy love.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|To see this movie is to be in the presence of greatness. If you have any appreciation of art, cinematic or otherwise, you must see this work. It is simply incredible.
0441008356|5.0|Reynolds manages to mix a mindblowing plot with 'hard' science in a way that only few authors can accomplish successfully. I cannot think of one page in this book, let alone one character or subplot, that is wasted. Never since Peter F. Hamilton's Night's Dawn trilogy have I encountered a universe this well thought out. The main plot of Revelation Space almost becomes secondary amidst all the 'wonders' of the setting with its intricate dynamics, strange cultures (the human cultures more so than the alien), and plague-ridden cities and spaceships, which - for a change - are not capable of faster-than-light travel.   <br />If you like John Barnes and Peter F. Hamilton, you'll enjoy Alastair Reynolds.
6303367518|5.0|this isnt exactly a horror film but its scary because it can really happen. Kevin Bacon is in it (one of my favourtes). He is mean and trys to capture this lady and family and they try to escape. He tried to kill them by a river, when they are camping out, and its totally freaky. I would reccommend you to see it. It is good for mostly everyone, and parents should allow it unless it might frighten a kid.
B00003CXN3|5.0|Anybody who calls this film &quot;long&quot; and &quot;boring&quot; should stick to the brain-dead swill that Hollywood typically spews out, for example &quot;Independence Day&quot;---or better yet, stick to their 10-second-attention-span MTV!  This is top-notch film-making that all too rarely sees the light of day these days: solid characters, good dialogue, masterful camera-work, plot and theme effortlessly woven together.  Above all, NOT the kind of comfortingly simplistic and predictable pap that its detractors are used to seeing.  In short: style AND substance, and blistering social commentary on these glorious United States.
6301697707|5.0|Kevin Bacon is one of my favorte actors, (besides Daniel Cerny) and he is in this film trying to hunt down these tremors. there are tons of other people(you need to have others to die) and they die (some of them). I hope you all know what a tremor is. Well anyways, they try to kill the tremors in the desert and as you can tell, tremors dont have eyes and they cant see. They track you down by vibration. Also, they cannot go on rock. So see the movie :)
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is perhaps the most intelligent and enthralling film I have seen for a long time. Not only does it have one of the most talented casts you will see but it has the story to go with it. For some people who enjoy their no brainer blockbusters it might be hard to comprehend but please persevere! You will be rewarded with the most twisty-turny film you will probably ever see. There is just so much to explain that i would not be able to do it any justice. The real appeal of the film for me however lies in the cast. You have three of the best actors you can see at present. Guy Pearce is outstanding as is Carrie-Ann Moss and the ever sinister Joe Pantoliano. I can't understand why Guy Pearce is not on a par with Russell Crowe or Kevin Spacey (co-stars in LA Confidential). He seemed to miss out on all the plaudits and he deserves more than just a glancing nod of appreciation for his talent. The film thoroughly deserves it five stars and should be in some of those top five film lists that will soon be appearing!
B000005S37|5.0|utterly genius. no other album was, or has been made entirely for doing crosswords, bathing, gardening, and other menial tasks to. this album also manages to destroy any anger that you may have. very peaceful, ambient. strangely enough, this is what it sounds like inside my brain, so i really have no need to buy this, but if you're going to, buy the LP, it is infinate.
B00003CXMG|4.0|Rock &amp; Roll in the 70's as perceived through a teen rock writer's all senses...plus other THREE WORDS-- KATE HUDSON ROCKS !!!<br />Ladies and gentlemen, the director Cameron Crowe keeps it real once again, kudos big time...<br />Welcome to the music world seen through the eyes of a teen rock music writer-- great rock music, pretty band-aid girls, your-name-is-not-on-the-list, non-stopping, swinging tour and lots more of this so-called INDUSTRY OF COOL world...It' s all happening, yea-ah !!!<br />Terrific ( great ) screenplay filled with the way-cool MOVIE MOMENTS ( if you loved those Jerry Maguire moment  scenes, you will do this one too ) and sublime performances from the great  cast-- big kudos to Kate Hudson ( she bangs..she bangs...). The film also won the Oscar for original writing work as well. Enjoy...
6301954947|5.0|This is one of the all time epic War movies, As another review stated they do not make them like this any more. There is no romance scenes in this movie,just non stop action, You can see by the price you pay to buy it used, compared to other war films there must be a reason for this premium price. For all of us that like a film with thousands of troops moving to the sound  of the guns and martial music. I really hope that some savy studio exec gets his hands on this film and re-releases it to the Wide screen or at the least puts it on a DVD
B00005B4GU|5.0|It's difficult for me to objectively criticize the best major band on the planet, especially when they might be the only decent major band on the planet. (Check the Top 40, then puke.) When was the last time a band or artist with massive commercial draw released work that is simultaneously so blatantly experimental (for a rock band) and so damn good? As Thom Yorke himself has said, &quot;I don't know if there's any value in being a rock band anymore.&quot; Radiohead, with the &quot;Kid A/Amnesiac&quot; sessions, has certainly transcended that limiting label.<br />This isn't just genre-hopping. It's the melding of avant, electronica and guitar rock into a new kind of music -- and the journey is extremely rewarding. They aren't the only ones out there on the frontier doing this, but they have exerted a major gravitational influence on everyone else who is. Why? Take a listen.
B00003CXDD|4.0|Most fantasy films  that are released usually aren't treated well by critics and this is one of  them. Except unlike Dungeon &amp; Dragons this one is actually good. When Willow was released people expected better from the Ron Howard/George Lucas team but how much better did they expect it to be ?  Because Willow delivers fun special effects, entertaining action sequences and a fun performance by Val Kilmer. The only bad thing about it is that Val Kilmer calls Warwick Davis a &quot;Peck&quot;  a little too many times. Plus the scene where Val and Warwick roll down a snowy hill and form a giant snow ball is a little too cartoonish. Still though Willow is as good as Fantays come. It has fire breathing dragons, fairies, an evil queen, trolls, wizards and too comical little guys called brownies.Disapointing ?  I think not!
B000006OHL|5.0|When I first saw this film I was surprised to see that it was a film Herrmann did the music for, but I didn't care for it. I think it was mainly because it was a late night and I was tired, so the film seemed to drag on. Months after that I heard a recording of a piece of Taxi Driver from the City of Prague Philharmonic, orchestrated by Christopher Palmer. I thought that it was exquisite. It was the best version of the score I ever heard. I rented the film after that and now I watch it quite a bit, and I also look forward each time to hearing Herrmann's dark haunting score. I love to listen to this cd in my truck, mainly at night since that was when the score was mainly written for. I feel like Travis Bickle seeing the problems that are still in our world today. The sad part of Bernard Herrmann though is that during the year of 1976, Herrmann had received two Oscar nominations from the films Obsession and Taxi Driver and died before seeing them. Herrmann could've wrote more music throughout the years since he was only 64 when he died. If you are a Herrmann fan, this soundtrack has to be in your collection, because it's the last original soundtrack that Herrmann wrote, not counting adaptions of his music in other films.  There are some things that should be mentioned though.  Bernard Herrmann, at the time of this recording, was in very ill health, and it was even a surprise that he came back to Los Angelos at all (he was living in England at the time, and his friend Laurie Johnson had to help conduct portions of his score for Obsession [1976], as well as the main title to his re-recording of Psycho [1960]). He was able to write the film music obviously, but the theme wasn't done entirely by him, but with help from his other friend Christopher Palmer, who took some music from a previous piece Herrmann had written, then added his own few bars that he named as a matter of fact (at least I think the few other bars that wasn't Herrmann's music, were Palmer's). Then when it came to have the film score conducted, Herrmann needed a conductor due to his health, so composer and orchestrator Jack Hayes was hired to conduct. This all has nothing to do with Dave Blume's recordings. I really do wish, after reading the biography, that Arista records had paid attention to this, because I'm not so sure that Herrmann would've wanted other people's services unnoticed. Otherwise, a fantastic album, Herrmann's last Oscar nominated score, and a tribute to a master of film composing that we lost too soon.
B00005M989|1.0|For all of those who are considering buying this compilation of songs that were thrown together without really considering the best songs is just a waste of money. I have been a fan since 1980 and I must admit that Prince is just a brilliant musical genius and for Wasrner Bros. to put this cd out for his fans was a true smack in the face to us. No.1, if you love Prince like I do then you will understand that alot of his songs weren't hits, 2.Some of the best ones weren't hits and wasn't put on the cd.3. Prince has too many songs to just put on 1 cd. Grant it I own hits/b-sides 3 cd set, but some of those songs were cut short like &quot;Do me baby&quot;, &quot;Adore&quot;, and &quot;1999&quot;. If a compilation cd needs to be put out and should it say, The very Best of Prince, let his fans be the ones to gather the right songs and put it together because it will be the best darn cd anyone has ever put out as a greatest hits album. Prince will always shine no matter what.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I must confess this is my favorite cd of all time. Every song has a great beat and very catchy.<br />1.Oops!...I Did It Again- Well you've all heard it before so basically you already know that it's a great song.  2. Stronger- You've also already heard this song. But anyway it has a great chorus.  3. Don't Go Knockin On My Door- One of my favorite songs on the album. It is very upbeat and catchy.  4. (I Can't Get No)Satisfaction- At first I didn't really care for it but now I think it's a great song.  5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know- I love love love this song. It is the best ballad on the cd.  6. What U See(Is What U Get)- Another wonderful upbeat pop song. This one can get stuck your head all the time. I absoulutely love this song.  7. Lucky- Great song to listen to even if you have heard 10 billion times.  8. One Kiss From You- A very sweet upbeat love song.But still not my favorite song on the album.  9. Where Are You Now- Great ballad and great vocals by Britney.  10. Can't Make You Love Me- Very good pop song. It kind of reminds me of What U See (Is What U Get)but not as good. Still a really catchy song.  11. When You Eyes Say It- A very romantic love song with a great chorus.  12. Dear Diary- A very slow song but I still love it. Britney wrote it herself.  If You get any cd this year definately get Britney Spears Oops!...I Did I It Again. You won't regret it!

6301942647|5.0|An untouchable visual feast.  It's a unbelievable that this film is not available on DVD!!
B00004SCX6|2.0|Well first of all being the anti-pop fantic that I am ( im 14 by the way) I jumped at the chance too poke fun at the Britster !(and that includes silly bands like Blink 182 and Creed) but i mean if i turn on the radio (which i rarley do) and i hear a good pop song i will listen too it and give it a unbiased listen.Who knows mabye I might like it??!!...doubtful. but im here too review an album not talk about my love for hateing entertainers acting as artists and pink things w/ fuzz. My little nine year old sister brought this cd home w/ her one day, as I heard it blaring though the bedroom walls I thought too myself Ya Know? Other than my Linkin Park and Slipnot cd i dont own a single top forty radio album!?? Seeing that every other person on the planet had discovered this Britney girl too be \\"truely gifted and creative genuis artist\\" i didnt want too feel as though I was missing out on anything! So of course i borrowed it <<<the day i went mental>>> and actually listen too the whole thing!! hmmmm...Stronger is okay...Lucky cheesy but alright..Dear Diary FUFF!....but why the heck is (I Cant Get No) Satisfaction on there!! I mean I like the Stone's and all and I know it wasnt there best song (Sympathy For the Devil & Ruby Tuesday were) but !*sweetjellybeans*! i cannot belive someone who helped turn over the music world from singer/songwriters (like Alanis Morrisette & Sheryl Crow..who are STILL popular) would even bother or even want too record a song like Satisfaction and i also serisously doubt she's heard the original. But im not telling you too go out and pick up a Nirvana, Led Zepplien or Aimee Mann cd. Cause if your here chances are your lookin too buy this or \\"IT\\" or whatever!...and still if your \\"like omg totally like into pop\\" fine go ahead !BUY IT! i dont care. All im saying is that your missing out and should open up and listen too any and all genres of music..(hey like i said im 14 and i listen too rock,blues,r&b,alternative,punk,ska,rockrap,indie,60s early 70s all kinds of stuff)mabye you'll find something you'll like?
B00004XQP4|4.0|I would hazard a guess that I am probably the oldest person reviewing this Greenday CD!  I grew up on the Beatles, The Who and the Rolling Stones...my grown up son is a passionate Greenday fan...as a treat when he and his sister were visiting me in San Diego this summer, I took them to see the band live.<br />I had never listened to their music before and never seen them even in a picture...All I know is...they are OUTSTANDING...a first class act with tremendous ability and stage presence.  One of the best, if not THE best event I have ever been to...and I've seen plenty. I got the CD Warning..most of the songs on it were featured at the concert...I've been playing it every day for a month!<br />In my opinion this album can stand up extremely well on its own..I have no need to compare it with any other or pass comment on what they did before....but I do know this is much.  If you like music played by outstanding musicians, played with energy, enthusiasm, rhythm, passion and style..you will love very song on this CD....GET IT!  You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXFV|3.0|Let's face it, though it was entertaining, it was little more than a TV movie of the week.  If Julia wasn't so dynamic it would have bombed.  Her performance was good, not her best.  I guess it was just her turn to go home with Oscar.  And from what I can ascertain, it seems as if she's not going to be the glittering star in the night sky for too much longer.  Unless of course she manages to get a little bit more into acting, and less into these kinds of public approval movies that are made just for cash.
0790749815|5.0|A spellbinding adventure from beginning to end. It has everything from murder to brief comedy. Gloriously Hitchcock!
0452282152|4.0|Great book! Chevalier paints a picture of the girl every bit as compelling as the Vermeer painting itself.  It is a carefully crafted glimpse into the dutch domestic life of the 17th century. Griet, the girl of the title, is a portrait of her times and the circumstances that create her alliance with the great artist. It is a deceptively simple book that stays with the reader long after the last pages are completed.  I wanted to read more and find out everything about her life and the little town.  I had purchased this book back in May - but put it away to read during our summer vacation and I am so glad I had the time to savor the story.  Chevalier uses prose in a most compact yet descriptive manner and draws characters skillfully. I would read it again - I probably will shortly! Thank you for a great story.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I like to see this movie every while ,becuse it's the best one of the top movies, it is the best of all in acting,story and in the directing of copola!!.and it's also the same for 2nd part shering of robert denoro was one of the better step that copola did in the movie...,3rd part was very good but one step behind the other.finally over all i give it 5 STAR.
0385335482|5.0|This book was a very good book...for a light, easy-to-read story. I can relate to the main character who shops and shops and shops...to celebrate and to mourn. The story does go beyond shopping and has a bit of a plot. It's very funny and a must read for anyone who's been prone to overshop.
0783227019|5.0|Carlito's Way ranks up there with Goodfellas as one of the best gangster movies of the 90s. Pacino is superb as Carlito Brigante, a legendary Puerto Rican gangster determined to leave his past behind after his release from prison, while Sean Penn is a revelation as the attorney who manages to get Carlito released after serving five years of a life sentence. The director, Brian de Palma, uses the unusual device of revealing what ultimately happens at the beginning of the film, but this does not diminish its impact, rather creating an air of incredible tension as we witness Carlito desperately struggling to escape the fate we know is in store for him. In particular, the chase scene through Grand Central Station, and the shoot out on the escalator, is superbly staged and every time I watch it I am left exhausted!<br />Like all tragic heroes Carlito has a fundamental flaw in his character that is ultimately his undoing. He is still bound by the code of honour of his youth, a code that the New York underworld is rapidly leaving behind, and he finds himself an anachronism in increasingly violent and ruthless times. Carlito's lawyer is on a downward spiral of self-destruction as his delusions of grandeur see him sucked into this world of crime, and due to the loyalty he feels he owes him, Carlito is sucked in as well. When he is implicated in the murder of a &quot;made&quot; Italian mafioso, Carlito's card is marked, and he realises too late that loyalty means nothing when you are the only one in thrall to it. A new breed of gangster, personified by Benny Blanco, is taking over, for whom honour means nothing and power means everything. The crux of the movie comes when Carlito has the chance to kill Benny, and although recognising that &quot;the street is watching&quot; he declines the chance, determined not to be drawn back into a world of violence. By letting Benny live, Carlito has shown &quot;weakness&quot; and in the final reckoning this weakness is ruthlessly exploited. <br />If I have a gripe with this brilliant film it is the ending. If De Palma could have resisted inserting Carlito's sentimental monologue into the last few frames, when he realises he won't live to see the future he dreams of with his girlfriend (played by Penelope Ann Miller) Carlito's Way would have been almost perfect. However, this is a small point and shouldn't detract from what is otherwise a magnificent piece of film making.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Sexy, jazzing, smooth. Buy this and get romantic with the one you love.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you thought the movie was funny, you'll love the soundtrack.  When I was listening to this soundtrack, I was amazed at how GOOD it was!!!  It has such a diverse sound that anyone can find something to love here.  I give it 5 stars!
B000001EIA|5.0|kulick and singer played great that night but only ace and peter made it history , more correctly kisstroy nothing else could be expected from kiss live , reallllly exellent solos by bruce ace and paul (a world without heroes) , peter is still the crazy drummer that he was then = something you got to have
B00000FCBC|3.0|This CD compilation of B-sides and new covers has some interesting contrasts.  The biggest one being &quot;Tuesday's Gone.&quot;  Show me where the metal part of Metallica went during THAT tune.  That's a song that could've REALLY used the Metallica treatment.  &quot;Turn the Page&quot; sounds infinitely heavier and better the way Metallica has covered it.  &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; is an interesting choice for the guys because it's not really heavy, but it is pretty melodic.  Then there's Disc 2.  Woah.  Track 2 is a great listen, and Am I Evil is one of the greatest metal songs to ever be recorded.  Then there's the classic cover of the Anti-Nowhere League's &quot;So What.&quot;  This song still gets me practically on the floor laughing, it's that funny.  And the riff and solo are fantastic, you just can't stop listening to it.  Then they give Queen the makeover with &quot;Stone Cold Crazy,&quot; which was good even before Metallica touched it.  But when they did, they blew everyone away with it.  But, even as this CD is entertaining, it's not Metallica.  It doesn't show the full potential of Metallica's playing, and certainly not songwriting.  This seemed to me, honestly, to just be a way for the guys to get some more bucks out of our pockets.  There's nothing revolutionary, different, or even that interesting on this record.  I think the guys felt lazy, and decided to just play someone else's songs and get some dough off of that.  But, the guys come back stonger than ever a year later.  So buy this only if you are curious.  Or for &quot;So What,&quot; whatever gets you going.
B000001EL7|5.0|kiss does it again , you can know this is something special that only kiss can make ace first vocal appearance is great (WHAT A SOLO !!) got plat. only from orders.....WoW !
B00000DRA9|5.0|The NeverEnding Story is my FAVORITE movie of all time, just ask my friends, and they'll say I am obsessed! I watched it a total of 5 times in one day! I practically know every line! So, that's why I just had to get the sound track! If you like this movie, you'll REALLY love this C.D. Even if you haven't seen this movie, you'll still enjoy the lovely sounds of the NeverEnding Story! :-)
B000001EXR|5.0|bruce kulick shows us what he knows , listen to seduction of the innocent and you'll understand what i'm talking abuot &amp; also the lyrics are very dark (hate ,childhoods end) , another thing that shows that this material might won't fit some fans  BUY IT &amp; TRY IT
1587880490|4.0|The story is phenomenal, and I highly recommend it - however, the CD quality left something to be desired. It kept fading in and out (and I tested it on several systems to make sure it wasn't just mine - it wasn't, it's definitely the CD). Bummer, as it's kind of distracting to such a powerful story.
B000002B35|5.0|The title of my review says it all.Stunning.Absolutely and completely.This one deserves every bit of praise heaped on it.Shine on You Crazy Diamond sets the mood for this album, and it justs gets better and better.Even if you &quot;kinda&quot; like Pink Floyd, this is a must buy.Frankly,though Roger Waters was a great lyricist and concept-album writer, I feel that his voice cannot match that of David Gilmour's( pardon this interjection, but in &quot;Vera&quot; on the album The Wall,Waters seems to be in severe spasmodic pain, when all he's apparently trying to do is render&quot;soul&quot; to the song), and his absence does not seem to be felt at all.However,there's one thing in Pulse that's not that great:David Gilmour's voice has developed a bit of a &quot;rasp&quot; as compared to the melody of his &quot;Hey You&quot; rendering,though this does not diminish the worth of the songs in any manner whatsoever.That said,this is a mature version of Floyd that we are hearing here.Pulse is also decidely experimental, and the combination of maturity and experimentalism makes this an absolute must-have.Go for it.
B000002H33|5.0|I guess I am writing this for the benefit of those too young to remember.  Because the rest of us will never forget.<br />Master Of Puppets is the culmination of all things pure which pushed Metallica from within before other forces began to pull & drag upon them (& dilute the vision).  This is not a criticism of where they are now - it is just to say...well, that in 1986 for a brief moment, they really had evolved to be Masters Of Puppets:  in complete control & realization of what they were born to do.  It is too convenient to say that they were changed after the passing of Cliff ('em all!) - I propose that they were headed in that direction anyway, simply because Masters is one of those albums you cannot duplicate.  Once it is done, it is done.  And I am sure the band would also argue that their sounds & production were still technically inferior compared to later work (ex. The Black Album & Load).  But anyone can say that.  Hardcore fans say they did not thrash anymore as much as Ride.  While I agree, I would still say that Masters is the most full, deep, & complete representation of what the band had within them to unleash upon the world.  <br />From the intro of Battery..., until the end of Damage (just throws you right off the cliff), Masters is 5-stars of metal destruction.  You will forget whatever you were listening to.  IMO, Leper Messiah & the title song have two of the heaviest opening riffs in the history of recorded music.  Headbanging 101.  But there is more.  The serious musicianship & composition really shows up in spades for the first time on this record.  Maybe because the band had finally stepped beyond the early material written w/ Dave Mustaine.  There was some real motivation in that mid-80's period to prove who needed who (the results being Masters & Peace Sells).  Nothing like rivalry w/ former band members to get the creative juices flowing, apparently.<br />This CD is a great headphone experience (great stereo) as well as being enjoyed instandard wall-crushing mode.  I guess I am assuming volume is still a prerequisite for the Metallica fan. If not, then I really don't know what encouraging words I can offer - & you can stop reading the review now.<br />For old school metalheads:  remember Z-Rock?  The 1st time I heard Masters album was Leper Messiah on the radio.  Since I was on the wrong side of Lake Michigan, I could barely tune it in on a good day.  I remember the static suddenly clearing as Lars hit the cymbals and then BAM!  That album was bought the next day.  It was like the music of Metallica had overpowered the airwaves!<br />Bottom line ==>  Masters Of Puppets:  not ever to be duplicated by any band (including Metallica).  It rules.  It's the real thing.  It's the original [music].  It's how it should be done.  Check it out.  You will be glad you did.  5 STARS FOREVER.
B00005A1PR|5.0|For lovers of earthy, natural sounding music, with lyrics geared to uplift and heal, this is the album for you.  the songs are not just songs, but many are anthems that help heal rifts between what we teach our daughters/sisters/lovers, and what we have commodified them to become.    An essential edition to any true music lovers collection
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac was suposedly gonna be Kid B but the fact of the matter is that Amnesiac is in  a class all its own. It starts out with the tecknoey song pakt like sardines in a crushed tin box in which thom pleads &quot;im a resonable man get off my case.&quot; that Goes right into maybe the best track of the cd, Pyramid song with its gentle piano intro and then finishing with the drums and the strings its like your drifting into another world. Pulk/pull revolving doors is (in my openion) the worst track. you and whose army builds you up to a great ending it starts on a piano when the drums kick in the song really gets good  .I might be wrong is outstanding with its country western feel and thoms somewhat distorted voice makes for a radiohead clasic. Knives out reminds me of Paranoid Android alot sounds like it should be on the bends or ok computer. Morning bell/Amnesiac is completly redone and better then ever much more deep and emotional. Dollers and cents is a  big mess but a good mess parts of the song the strings are so loud u cant hear thoms voice. Hunting bears could have been replaced by something much better all it is, is a guitar solo. Like spinning plates is mezmorizing with backwards music and lyrics it makes for an intristing song. Finally Life in a glass house is a great way to close the cd the song sounds like a  funeral happening in new orleans in the early 1900's. Overall Amnesiac is is a Beautiful cd that should make any radiohead fan happy
B000006TRV|3.0|Following on the heels of the amazing &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, this long-awaited and eagerly anticipated 2-record set got sour reviews from almost everyone I knew when it was first released. What a let-down. It seems as if the band consciously set out to create a best-selling album, anticipating a flurry of stage-productions in it's wake, the way movie producers now work out the sequal and merchandising rights before they even begin filming. The theatrical sound, the contrived melodrama, is blatant. And perhaps a stage-production is what it should have been first. Then the album. Maybe then it would have worked better.  After the spontaneous and brilliant &quot;Dark Side&quot; (where, despite the complexity of the writing and the production, it feels as if everything just simply and effortlessly &quot;clicked&quot;) the desolate theme of The Wall is pushed beyond it's ability to sustain itself naturally. To me this album feels heavy, laboured, forced and drawn out with filler material to get 2 records out of it. That's not to say there aren't two or three great &quot;songs&quot; to be heard here; certainly &quot;Pleasantly Numb&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot; and &quot;Another Brick in The Wall&quot; are classics, and with good reason. They are played over radio stations all the time because they well written, quality pieces. But &quot;The Wall&quot; as a whole would have been better off as one record. Then maybe the gems that are worthwhile in this long, rambling production would have become cystalized, like a haiku; thought-provoking (without being heavy-handed) and leaving us wanting more....not having had enough.
B00003CXV4|5.0|We watched this DVD last and did not know anything at all about this movie.  I am VERY AVID about not knowing anything about a movie before I watch it.  The rewards of knowing absolutley nothing are worth the occasional risk of getting a terrible movie.  In this case, I was very well rewarded.  As a man, I often get films that I know women will enjoy, even if I am not sure I will enjoy the movie.  I am avoiding talking about specifics in this movie, because I do not like to reveal any details, hoping that others will simply take my advise and let the film 'move' you.  This is a very emotional movie.  I have not had a movie affect me to this large of a degree in a long time.  The acting is absolutely enjoyable and superb.  This is one of those movies that I wish I could go back and watch it again as though it were the first time.  I am a very critical person and it says a heck of a lot for me to give 5 stars.  I reserve 5 star ratings for only the absolute best movies.  I believe this is my first 5 star rating on.  Outstanding!

B00003CXQY|4.0|The Emperor's New Groove was reworked from another film &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot; that was scrapped well through the process of making it.  The only things remaining are David Spade and a song by Sting.  I didn't see Emperors New Groove in the theater, but picked up the DVD, because I can't resist a special edition.  I laughed quite a bit at David Spade, John Goodman, and Patrick Warburton, but especially Eartha Kitt.  The features will keep you busy for hours, and the film will keep you chuckling.
B000056K04|2.0|I was personally disappointed with this album, and the chicago concert. Unlike DMB's previous albums, &quot;Everyday&quot; lacks the groove that the band has, dave's nearly impossible guitar licks, and the great improv by Leroi Moore and Boyd Tinsley. Carter Beuford's drumming genious was reduced to a beat that could have been synthesized.  If it weren't for Dave's voice, you would not even think this was a dave matthews band album.  The lyrics are missing dave's emotion, and the electric guitar tries to make up for the poor songwriting. Glen Ballard is a pop producer, and thats what he is. DMB could do without him. I've been a DMB fan since &quot;Remember Two Things&quot;, and I have every one of DMB's albums. After listening to &quot;Everyday&quot; for an hour, I feel depressed, and I eventually turn the music off, because it doesn't groove like it should. Just wait a year or two and buy &quot;The Summer So Far&quot; (The Lillywhite Sessions). The songs were abandoned because of the bad vibe they had in the studio which set DMB on a new pop track. This album isn't a BAD album, but it isn't Dave Matthews.
B000001ZS3|5.0|Nearly quarter of the century after its initial release, this album still sounds crisp, clean and fresh. <br />You will be surprised that synthetic instrumental music can be so captivating, and that you can listen to sounds of bubbles for hours on end. Definitely a good buy.
0395925037|3.0|Let's face it, Hitler is not the best writter a man can be. His writtings are, in some way, unorganized, almost as if it were a dairy. However, deep into the jungle of words, you can find a treasure of content and information about Nazism that only Hitler can give. This book is long and sometimes get boring, but there are some sections that really make you understand the feelings and perceptions of Der Führer. This book is a piece of gold for researchers, students or anyone who really wants to dig into the roots of the Nazi leader. He tells the story from the very beginning of his life as politician, and even gets more into the past when he was a condecorated soldier. Although it won't give you the answer of why he did what he did, this will give you a very good inside look of the political system Hitler established on Germany for more than 10 years. If you dispise anti-semitism hardly, beware, since this book has too much pages insulting and telling how &quot;threatening&quot; Jews are.
B000002MY3|3.0|Back in the summer of 1994, when Alanis Morissette's jilted-chick anthem &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; was just starting to make itself noticed, a DJ on a small Jersey alternative station used to amuse himself and his audience by playing the song, then immediately following it with a song from one of Alanis' dance pop CDs that he'd managed to obtain from Canada (they have never and will never be sold in the States, thanks to Maverick Records).  &quot;Just so you don't take her too seriously,&quot; he would say after the pop song.<br />Of course, now Alanis is considered by many to be the voice of a generation, thanks to the staggering sales of &quot;Jagged Little Pill.&quot;  Being one of the sixteen million purchasers of the CD, my take on JLP is much the same as that DJ's--I like it, but I don't consider it the Gen-X feminist manifesto so many others do.<br />JLP fairly screams Alanis' youth, as she was only 19 at the time these songs were written.  No one can be pissed off quite like a jilted 19-year-old!  &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; is pure vengeance, that &quot;I'm going to make you SO sorry you dumped me!&quot; vibe that every woman's felt and every man's feared.  &quot;Right Through You&quot; is kind of a softer take on that, more of a &quot;I'll get along without you just fine&quot; thing.  But all on JLP is not angst; the cheerful &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; and the singalong &quot;Ironic&quot; (definition aside, it's a great pop song) are nice changes of pace.<br />Alanis writes interesting lyrics, and her voice, if not breathtaking, is competent and distinctive--those of you who think she can't sing would do well to listen to her early teen-queen stuff, because she's improved tremendously since then.  However, the lyrics are often awkwardly paired with the music, suggesting that producer/co-writer Glen Ballard came up with the tunes first and Alanis plugged in the words; syllable stresses come in odd places.  I give credit to Alanis from being able to so successfully rise above her pop princess beginnings, but I still don't take her all that seriously.  &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is a good record, but she's still mainstream, kids.
0679412719|5.0|The opening of the second book is so universal that it will ring true as long as Humanity exists.  We are so fortunate that his private writings have survived.  This is one of a handfull of books that should be in every library and read once a year!
B000001FRY|5.0|It is staggering to listen to this album and finally realize how much talent that U2 displays in only their first album. Every time I listen to it, I am blown away by how incredible their music is. U2 has been a major influence in my life, and I'm only 13! I'm listening to 'Twilight' as I type, and I listen to the music and I don't know what it is but it's just amazing how much skill they have. They sound like they've been in the business for years.
B000002UJQ|5.0|In &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, the second track on Radiohead's CD OK Computer, Thom Yorke sings about the &quot;chicken voices in my head&quot;.  Well, what the hell does that mean?  Don't bother trying to make sense of most of the lyrics, especially since most of them defy meaning. The beauty of this CD has less to do with the lyrics and more with the musical arrangements.  You'd have to be a corpse if the emotional sweep of these twelve songs don't make you hot in the face.  There's the jangling guitar of &quot;Electioneering&quot;, the solemn piano of &quot;Karma Police&quot;, and my absolute favorite, the swooping rollercoaster guitar that punctuates Yorke's lament, `I'm just uptight` in &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;.<br />Of course, as time passes, a theme does emerge with OK Computer - and one of them lies in the very inscrutability of its gorgeous lyrics.  Radiohead didn't intend to make a pretty album wrapped with a neat little bow.  I liken this album to the wizened Christmas tree Charlie Brown brought back from the forest. It's messy, cold, lonely and unseemly, but in today's artificial, calculated and impersonal age of technology, OK Computer redeems itself, even revels, in its organic ugliness.

0553296981|5.0|The story of Anne Frank is both extraordinary and ordinary.  Anne was a hero who showed an attitude of hope even in the most appalling circumstances.  Frank is ordinary, because I think nearly every girl can see herself as a young teenager through Anne.  We can relate to Anne's interest in the opposite sex, her frustrations and joys as she becomes a young woman, her struggles to relate to the adults in her life.  The reader will be ultimately uplifted by Anne's assertion &quot;in spite of everything, I still believe people are good at heart.&quot;  I carry this line within my heart, when I'm going through personal hardship and remember the heroism of a young girl in Holland.
B00005N83O|5.0|I love the remix! It's got a cool slow vibe, and I like Ja Rule's singing. Jennifer and Ja Rule made one heck of a collaboration. The way they sing, the way the music flows and so on, cause it's real! AND I CAN'T GO ON WITHOUT THIS SONG!

6302256704|5.0|This movie is great! It has laughs all through the movie! Even at the semi-romantic part at the end when Topper (Sheen) pulls out to steaks to cook on his girlfriend's stomach. Lloyd Bridges is brilliant in this movie! The only bad part of this movie is that Ryan Stiles did not get more screen time. Other funny parts are when the Admiral drops his hat and demands somebody goes out on a raft for days looking for it, Mailman get's shot mistaken for a deer, everybody in the Air Force is somehow linked toward the killer and victim, &amp; when washout tells the victim's child that he didn't have 2nd's.     Two of the characters that stick out in my mind are Washout and Deadmeat. If you like comedy you will love this movie.

076790382X|4.0|Bryson, in my view, has managed to pull off another excellent piece of work (but with a little difficulty this time round).  When I first read that the book was simply made up of columns Bill Bryson had written for an English newspaper, I was a bit curious as to what the quality would be like.  The book is a collection of short columns written over an eighteen month period on the aspects of American life.<br />It starts off brilliantly, dipping in quality a bit in the middle, but comes back strong again towards the end. During the opening chapters, my worries on the quality of the book were immediately pushed aside, but later on throughout the book, it looked to me like Bryson was being pushed into writing about subjects he didn't want to write about, as if his ideas had dried up.  I was almost about to stop reading it altogether, but a few brillant chapters set the ball rolling again, and it finishes on a high.<br />The main attraction of this book is the ease of reading.  Each chapter takes only 5 - 10 minutes to complete.  If you would like a book that you can just pick up at any odd time to read for a few minutes every now and then, then this book is for you.  Beware though, once you read one funny chapter, you'll want to keep reading, and reading.  Bryson's easy style also adds to the accessibility of this book.<br />Bill Bryson isn't an American who glorifies all aspects of American life (like many of the Hollywood movies for example), but simply gives an honest account on how he pictures his own nation to be (though he can very cynical at times, funny, but cynical).  I find it interesting, being British, how Bryson often compares his home nation with mine (but as he is writing for an English newspaper, he often seems to unfairly tip the scales in Britian's favour, but again, with an add of humour).<br />'I'm Just A Stranger Here Myself' further enhances Bill Bryson's reputation as the funniest travel writer in modern times.
B00003CX5P|3.0|While I did love the first three Star Wars, this version was not up to par.... I hated Jar-Jar Creap and the wasted storyline they had with the young Darth Vader could have been better.... I don't think they should have made him so young, it would have been better if  he  was in his early teens, where you can say, yeah I see why he went to the Dark Force...  Instead we have a boring race to save the day. YARN!!!!<br />But their is light at the end of this narrow tunnel...  The other characters were way better.. Queen Amidala played by Natalie Portman was a freshing change in the story. <br />Darth Maul was, well; what can I say EVIL.  <br />For the life of me I don't know why they waited 2 years before they put out the DVD I thought that was pretty stupid.  Even if I really like this movie, and I had to have it I would never buy the VHS version, No way.<br />Hopefully when the other two comes out they will release the DVD as well as the VHS.
0684857219|5.0|This book is truly phenomenal. &quot;The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding&quot; by Arnold Schwarzenegger covers all the aspects of this fantastic sport.  From exercise routines to contest preparation, Arnold has created the only book you'll ever need to succeed in the sport of bodybuilding.  His section on contest preparation is one of the most thorough I have seen yet.  The contest preparation section covers dieting, grooming, posing routines, even what type of posing trunks a person should wear.  A definite need for the competing bodybuilder.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Firstly it was wonderful reliving my childhood watching this film. The remastered sound and vision blowed my mind. What annoyed me was the 'added parts of the film integrated into it'. Well- when I was a kid, those SO CALLED integrated bits where in it when it screened on Australian T.V! Granted- not when you hired the movie out on VHS. Secondly, the two scenes with Lex luthers 'babies' were integrated into it when it screened on Australian T.V. On the DVD its put onto a section called 'deleted scenes'. How can they be 'deleted' if I remember seeing them as a kid. Why couldn't they have been remastered and integrated into the film! Pity, this movie is a 5 star movie. The DVD only really deserves 3 stars but because of the excellent job they have done on remastering it I'll give it 4 stars.
1577311523|5.0|I've have been on a spiritual journey for many years.  The Power of Now is one of the clearest books I've read on the subject of making spirituality practical.  As I read the book I was glad to see that Tolle's ideas are built on the Bible and other spiritual teachings.  I have incorporated some of the exercises into my own practice of spiritual healing.  <br />I was also struck by the resonance to the ideas in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.  While the language in Science and Health is different, because it was written in the 19th century, it is clearly in harmony with Tolle's writing.<br />So now, in addition to getting spiritual direction from sacred texts of the world and Science and Health, I have added Power of Now to my spiritual travel bag.  The closest on-line dialogue I've found for ideas like this is at (          ).
6305358567|5.0|Although the film plays with history a bit, Shekhar Kapur and staff did a fabulous job with cinematography, costumes, and choosing the actors.  The film  recounts Elizabeth's conspirated rise to her thrown as well as the very beginning of her reign.  After ridding England of her enemies, she vows not to be the same vulnerable girl she once was; and to make herself an icon to not only her people, but her court.  This sudden shift of personality seems like she is saying &quot;Noone can touch me anymore.&quot;    I give the film an A+ just for the camera angles, music and actors.  If anything could be better, it would be complete historical accuracy. Outstanding film!
B000000Y2R|5.0|This cd is an amazing document. If this is the only surviving artifact of the 20th century, of human civilization tout corps, then future races and alien species will undoubtedly be in agreement (however naively) that we were giants, that we, as a people, humans, earthlings, had emotional depth, a refined aesthetic sense, humour, intellectual refinement, and anything else you would want and hope for in sentient beings. The music here is perfect, sublime, peerless in its execution, epic in its scope, minute and detailed like the most finely wrought baroque trifle. Everything that it is to live and die in this world  finds expression and reflection here. Unbelievable. Unforgettable. Unsurpassed.
0393316041|2.0|The moral of the book: being a great physicist and a self-absorbed turdface are not mutually exclusive.<br /><br />Feynman regales us with story after story in which he demonstrates--besides a genuine love of physics, scrupulous scientific honesty, and a childlike curiosity--his spitefulness, provincialism, and arrogance. Since plenty of reviewers have spent ample time emphasizing the former, I'll concentrate on the latter.<br /><br />Time after time, Feynman portrays Feynman as a small-town guy thrown into the midst of city slickers, getting himself into trouble. The battle seems hopeless: how can this kid from the sticks win against such impossible odds? But by virtue of his simple honesty and courage, he somehow shows up the city slickers and wins the day. He just can't get enough of this story--indeed he repeats it over and over, in numerous situations and with countless antagonists (many of whom, after stabbing them in the back, he calls his friends), to hammer the point into the reader's brain: FEYNMAN IS AWESOME. Whether reading such an unabated egofest is effort well-spent, I leave to you to judge; but if you don't think so, don't pick up the book.<br /><br />Many of his tales demonstrate what he regards as a profound lesson: everyone in the arts, religion, or humanities is incredibly dumb, narrow-minded, and stuck-up. This seems an incredibly dumb, narrow-minded, and stuck-up judgment. Would he have had the same opinion if he'd met Tolstoy or the Buddha? (Alas, almost certainly).<br /><br />But the tale I find most awful--and the most revelatory of his character--is the one about the waitress whom he torments by placing her tip in a glass full of water, which he then covers and inverts on the table (the physics lesson--for the folks at home--is that air pressure will keep the water from flooding out when you remove the cover). He duly slides the cover out from under the glass and leaves the restaurant. As he relates, chortling to himself all the while, the waitress, unable to figure out a way to clear the table without spilling the water, was forced to clean the whole mess up. (One wonders whether the nameless waitress ever read the book--and, if she did, how vividly she remembered her humiliation at Feynman's hands).<br /><br />So, a brilliant scientist uses basic physics to hassle a woman working an exhausting, stressful minimum-wage job! There's a name for this kind of behavior: bullying. The big kid on the playground uses strength of body, Feynman strength of mind; but it's the same thing at bottom. Of course, we're supposed to hate the big kid, but love Feynman (who, unlike the kid, presumably knows better).<br /><br />Feynman the Character (apart from Feynman the scientist) is unduly worshipped by physicists. It's as if they have to point to him, while shouting defensively to the world's artists, writers, musicians, and directors, \\"See! See! We can have personality too!\\" The popularity of the book is partly a symptom of this Feynman cult. But I suspect it's also because his fans believe that he managed to make everyone else look like fools and have people love him for it--and they secretly wish they had the same power.<br /><br />Judging from the book, I don't think that annoying other people was all Feynman lived for (clearly, physics was the center of his life), but he certainly did enjoy it.

B00004X01U|4.0|I have never liked techno that much. &quot;Music&quot; came unexpectedly for me. But good ole Madonna turns my opinion around immediatly with the first track Music. The rhythm DEMANDS attention. But she is still Madonna. She hasn't lost one bit of her sexy image, let alone voice which she proves in Impressive Instant. And girl power is resurrected once more in the form of What It Feels Like For A Girl. But then she counteracts herself with Amazing where she has fallen helplessly for a boy. Every song is as gripping as the last. This has a little bit of everything, techno, rock, pop, country, you just can't say no. This is the new Madonna, and if you sit down and listen to it, you will find she isn't radical at all. This is what became of the seeds planted with the tecno-driven Ray of Light. But before you buy this amazing record you have to ask yourself one question.<br />Do you like to boogie woogie? You will...

0385495323|4.0|The book traces the history of ciphers;its origins ,evolution.Right from ancient times man has sought ways to conceal his confidential correspondence.This, author says ,gave birth to cryptology:the art of secret writing.<br /><br />So cryptology,unlike other branches of knowledge,has a rich past.Over the centuries it has passed through several stages.From manual ciphers of ancient times,progressing towards mechanical encryption during Industrial age and finally to electronic encryption with the dawn of computer era.<br /><br />First step in this direction was Steganography.Then evolved different forms of substitution ciphers.Substitution ciphers can be further classified into monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic ciphers.The author has given schematic representation of evolutionary structure of secret writing.<br /><br />At this juncture, I wish to add the development of cryptology predominantly hinged upon advances in the field of cryptanalysis.Cryptanalysis is the art of cracking ciphers.It reminds me of perpetual rivalry between ballistic experts and armour specialists.While former seeks to perfect projectiles capable of piercing thickest and strongest of all armour , latter tries to find ways to make armour impervious to penetration.This engendered the development of superior forms armour.Same too is the case with cryptology.<br /><br /> Arab cryptanalysts , in the middle ages using frequency analysis ,were able to destroy the security of monoalphabetic cipher.This development led to cryptologists developing superior forms of encryption. Thus came polyalphabetic ciphers and homonyms.<br /><br />A reader of this book will find how successful penetration of ciphers had a profound impact on the course of history.Among incidents narrated - to mention a few -assassination of Mary queen of scots, Zimmermann Telegram ,cracking of Nazi Enigma ciphers by British cryptanalysts working at GCCS at Bletchley Park considerably shortend the duration of Second World War.There is a excellent account of German Enigma machine cipher.<br /><br />The operation of Enigma, given by other authors , has always baffled me.But after reading author's version I could understand its intricacies better.Few pages in the book have been devoted to how code breaking has enriched our knowledge of the past.Decipherment of Egyptian Hieroglyphics by French linguist Champollion and cracking of Minoan Linear B by Michael Ventris .<br /><br />In the concluding chapters of the book author dwelts upon complexties of computer encryption especially how cryptologists were able to overcome 'key exchange problem . Each encryption has something called algorithm or key which specifies the meathod for encrypting the message.In electronic encipherment conventional ways of exchanging keys would have caused immense logistical problems.But thanks to enthusiasm and perseverance shown by a group of American engineers the problem was solved which again shows that human ingenuity knows no bounds.In our internet age encryption assumes prime importance as this could only ensure the safety of e-commerce transactions.<br /><br />Finally, Mr Singh has prophesied the shape of things to come.Quantum cryptography which I found trifle difficult to understand.Author says quantum encryption is virtually impervious to hackers.So he ends the book in an optimistic note.Author deserves felicitations as he endeavoured to make abstruse subject as simple as possible.The book is a sheer delight to read .However reader wanting to draw more information on the subject must turn to David Kahn's monumental Code Breakers or his recently published voluminous tome History of Secret Writing.ne cipher.

The two of them are hysterically funny (even though I don't think they intended to be).  They need to make a movie about this book and star in it themselves *hint*.<br />The book is very entertaining and will hook you right from the start.  Even if you are not a fan of their music, the intimate details they divulge about their lives makes you want to be a fly on their wall just to see if is humanly possible to do what they did and still be alive today &gt;=)

B00005M4JS|4.0|Lasse Hallstrom had the task of making a sweet, light-hearted, and affecting film from a story that delicately mined issues like morality, tolerance, and inclusion.  Not the easiest of tasks but aided by the radiance of Juliette Binoche, he pulls it off brilliantly.  Chocolat is like a fairy-tale, a gently told tale of a provincial French village in the 1950s and the clever north wind- in the form of Viane and her daughter Anouk, that stirs more than the leaves.  Viane is fiercely independent but dispenses her advice and her help- in the form of chocolate- with understated grace. Viane's own life is complicated slightly by the arrival of a river gypsy in Johnny Depp who's freedom of spirit is akin to Viane's restlessness for movement.  The story is perfectly-paced but its best asset are beautiful performances from the cast.  Lena Olin, Judi Dench, and Depp all should have been contenders for Oscars, but it's Binoche who is unforgettable.  The radiance of her smile alone adds a special charm.  It's a shame that she wasn't given the Oscar but, as in Paltrow and Blanchett and few years before, the Academy went for sentiment over quality.  Over all, an amazing, generous performance by Binoche and an all-around delightful film.
B00005JK93|2.0|Although sometimes very entertaining (e.g., Hansel's dance scene), behind the flashy exterior is a lot of sentimental nonsense.  The songs are mostly uninteresting, the lyrics are mostly embarrassing, and the film's philosophy is almost entirely juvenile.  The end of the film flails toward something interesting, but fails.  A lot of people have enjoyed this movie, and many more will also enjoy it -- but if you're thinking of going, know what you're in for.  Colorful it may be; meaningful it is not.
B000001ESN|5.0|Permanent Waves photographs Rush at the perfect moment--still young and hard-rocking but, six years after their recording debut and the requisite dues-paying of long tours, wielding razor sharp progressive songwriting experience melded with tremendous technical skills.<br />Yes, this album &quot;only&quot; has six tunes, but they are all richly crafted. There's no filler to be found on this album. Rush at this point had evolved beyond doing space-rock concept albums, but while they were admittedly moving to mildly more radio friendly songwriting, they still liked fairly long songs. Even these, however, were skillfully pared down to the essentials, centered around cohesive lyrical ideas that allowed for stretching-out musically. Cases in point: Freewill, Jacob's Ladder, and especially the intense &quot;Natural Science&quot; (don't let the bland title dissuade you from enjoying the full force of the trio wash over you). Even the most commercial tune on the album, &quot;The Spirit Of Radio,&quot; is an instrumental workout that also radiates the sincerity of redoubtable musicians who are hardly &quot;selling out.&quot;<br />This album resembles Hemispheres in the mind-boggling *huge* sound conjured up by only three people on the traditional guitar/bass/drums. Part of this is because Geddy's bass and Neil's drums are equally kinetic but more importantly synced up so deeply on rhythmically difficult passages.  It's also because Alex chased down some of the hugest analog guitar sounds I've ever heard, a real benchmark even today. Synths are usually relegated to background pedal points and uncluttered atmospherics that subtly fill out the upper sonic reaches. The guest piano added by long-time album cover artist Hugh Syme on the ballad &quot;Different Strings&quot; is a perfect counterpoint in texture, a respite before the force of &quot;Natural Science,&quot; and an example of how deft use of space paradoxically adds density. Not to mention the fact that the tune--lyricsand all--is a bit of a rarity, written by Geddy in a display of matured sophistication (usually it's Neil who writes the lyrics while the other two concentrate on the music).<br />Moving Pictures, the other &quot;peak&quot; Rush album in the Hemispheres-Permanent Waves-MP period, is considerably darker by comparison to this bittersweet yet warm, probing, mature masterpiece. And it is a welcome example of the remasters, which have generally greatly improved the presence and warmth of all the Rush catalog, where applied. To me, Permanent Waves is the perfect &quot;summer&quot; album (welcome any time of year!), with a great overall groove and blend of musicianship that can't help but get the blood flowing, or make a road trip pulse just a little bit faster. As a refined, yet powerful and intriguing harder rock that not only stays with you past adolescence but also helps you reminisce with energetic warmth, this is it.

The Lemony books feature children who are destined to have terrible things happen to them, with no chance of rising above their fate.  It is obvious that HarperCollins has sunk a ton of money in promotion for Mr. Snicket, who apparently has no respect for his fans.  Too bad.  My three children hated his didactic drivel. Come one, Harpers, wise up!! Get an author who has respect for his fans.  When an author shows up saying he is not the author at all but a friend, and signs his books, &quot;To a future orphan,&quot; we know the author is trying desperately to be a *star*, but not necessarily a lover of his children-fans!! If only Mr. Snicket would understand that parents are shelling out  money based on their kids's suggestions...
B00003CXN4|4.0|But needless to say it is an overall wonder.  The supurb filming catches your emotions right away, while as brief as some of the characters are on the screen, the acting behind each one is wonderful.  Critics may say that the movie needed more time to develope strong characters.  I find it amazing at just how deep some of the characters are.  If you want to see very deep character development go buy Traffik (the british mini series that was brought over to the US) but if your looking for a great movie that will capture you from beggining to end, with wonderfully interwoven plots, buy this.
B00000HYXB|5.0|I bought this blind after owning the Demons and Wizards CD for about a week.<br />Well, maybe not blind, I don't remember seeing any reviews less than 5 when I made the purchase.<br />Whether the reviewer was overjoyed with the portrayal of the Tolkein book, of a long-time fan of BG, each was overflowing with praise. Now I am too.<br />I've had this disc for a year and I still listen to it. For some people that's no big deal, but for me it's an accomplishment. There's too much other stuff to listen to for me to commit one CD to the changer for an extended period of time, but I keep coming back to Nightfall.<br />It's good.<br />I won't try to say why I like it so much but whatever these guys do in the future I'm buing it.

0380973650|3.0|The basic premise of the book is the story of the last of the American gods, including those brought over from the old country that are disenfranchised and forgotten by today's future-looking culture. That is a cool idea that leads to some interesting characters (although the gods he chooses to introduce seem picked at random). Also,the main character \\"Shadow\\" is attractive enough that you want to see what happens to him. The prose is crisp and humorous which also keeps you reading. Interspersed with Shadow's story are little vignettes of the arrival of gods from different countries to America. These are gripping and emotional, and worth reading as short stories in themselves, but at times they seem more like essays interspersed into the story. But these excellent traits are offset by a couple of flaws. First, there is no driving plot discernable. Shadow's character is lethargic and he seems to wander through life letting things happen to him. That would be fine if others took charge, but they don't. Instead, Shadow is crucified on the One Tree. Is he Christ? Is he the evil hanging god? A clear sense of who Shadow is supposed to be is missing even though there are hints he is &quot;somebody.&quot; There are veiled references to an &quot;armageddon&quot; between old and new gods that never materializes. The conflict in the book is mysterious and never clear. The two main groups-new gods and old gods--are planning a war the entire book and end up not fighting. I think that is the probably the whole point-but it still makes for a book without seeming direction or tangible conflict. I wanted to root for Shadow and it was hard to do so. This is especially surprising since in earlier works Gaiman was a master of the sprightly plot. Gaiman latched on to a nice idea but it does not seem to be carried through or thought out enough. One gets the feeling there could have been a mystery here, a revelation, and something deeper and more solid about gods and their relationship to humans. A lot of potential not met.  Summary: The prose, ideas, and main character will lead you through, but don't look for a clear battle or result.humans. A lot of potential not met.

6304025831|4.0|Though not his best, Casino is far from the worst Scorcese movie.  Reunited with the crew from Goodfellas, Joe Pesci, De Niro, and Nicolas Pileggi, Casino is very similar to Goodfellas, though not as strong.   De Niro plays his usual character, the guy who a pro at what he does and seems to have everything under control.  But this time, De Niro is the most sympathetic character which is a change of pace.  Pesci is essentially the same character from Goodfellas, a hot headed loose cannon who ends up causing more trouble than good.  Sharon Stone shines as ex-prostitute turned wife of De Niro.  Stone plays an absoulute terrible person in this movie.  But she does it to perfection and recieved a well deserved Academy Award nomination.   The imagery and pacing are almost identical to Goodfellas,  with the voice overs and the quick jumps from scene to scene, as well as the classic rock soundtrack.   There are a few memorable scenes.  The sledgehammer scene is not easily forgotten.  The corn field meeting also sticks with you.   The movie was alittle long, but the performances were good enough to keep it from dragging to much.     Overall it's not a classic like Goodfellas, but it is an ejoyable watch if you have 3 hours to spare.

Since then, these &quot;short stories&quot; have wiggled their way into my heart, and I now listen to them with awe.  Peaceful, lovely, passionate and gentle music.  Full of wonder and an understated, calming spirituality.  Unusual clarity and memorable melodies, with the warmth of two great personalities and a very special friendship behind them.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|In the mood for a psychological thriller?  Memento had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Yet somehow even with all of the tension and serious subject matter, this film manages to have a sense of humor.  This film is not only prime entertainment, but exhibits true brilliance with the way it forces the process of memory, inherently an internal function, into the visual realm with Leonard's disability.  Leonard shows us how memory really works with all of its self-selected inacuracies and incomplete thoughts.

I got through Coltrane and thought it sounded all right then I put on KIND OF BLUE and felt like Bill Walsh seeing Jerry Rice run an out pattern at Missippi Valley State.

0804106304|5.0|There are some barriers to enjoying this wonderful book.  It may be hard to understand the dialogue and some of the themes if you are not Asian, and the names are important to following the story, and are all Chinese.<br />But beyond this, you could not imagine a better book.  After I finished it, I called my mother crying.  Although your mother will probably never cut flesh from her arm to feed her own dying mother, become a man's third concubine, or leave her twin babies on a path, you may read this and find a new appreciation for what she has given you.<br />Tan deftly manages the development of eight characters, when one seems to be overwhelming to many other authors.  She tells both sides of conflicts, reaching into each character's weaknesses, and helping them find their strengths.  She paints a vivid picture of modern America and a China past that is spellbinding.  But best of all, she depicts love gently and fully.  This core human emotion takes on new forms and dimensions under her talented pen, helping the reader to see love where it might not have been apparent.<br />This is a riveting insight into Asian culture.  Although the term \\"As far as the east is from the west\\" can denote great distance, this book helped me to realize that my western self can be very close to my eastern mom in ways I never imagined.  This book helped me understand and appreciate her more fully, and I hope you will read this book, and call your mother or guardian crying too.<br />Get your copy from...  - always a wonderful experience!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|...any why not? It's one of the greatest albums ever recorded.<br />No amount of hyperbole can overstate the genius of this album. Knopfler's gift may not be his amazing guitar playing, it may be his awesome restraint.<br />Considering that almost anything you hear by supposed guitar greats like Satriani or Van Halen ends up, more-or-less, being a tribute to the guitar playing, it is impressive that Knopfler never forces himself on his listeners.<br />&quot;Sultans of Swing,&quot; perhaps one of the five greatest rock songs ever recorded, is wonderful all by itself. It is not until you listen to the song five, six, three hundred times do you get a sense of Knopfler's subtle, almost sublime guitar work. The playout is awesome, making most listeners beg for another minute of song.<br />I have seen Dire Straits live, and was not impressed. Perhaps a large auditorium (like Chicago's nasty Alstate Arena) is too large to capture the subtle and finite efforts of a group this sublime.<br />The whole self-titled album is like this. &quot;Dire Straits&quot; plays more like a novel than an album, moving slickly between understated tracks that only periodically open themselves up to the explosive guitar work Knopfler is capable of.<br />Years later this albums sounds and feels as fresh as the day it was released. Devoid of trendiness and oblivious to the disco-era that saw its birth, &quot;Dire Straits&quot; stands alone as a single album from a fairly crummy couple of years for music.<br />Anyone who considers themself a guitar-rock fan should have this album in their collection.

Mitch and Morrie shared a passionate, respectful friendship that is rare, especially considering the age difference.  Nevertheless, these two men taught one another, along with the readers, so much about life, respect, getting old, and mostly, how to enjoy the little things we all take for granted.<br />Morrie showed great courage as he slowly faded away.  Through his stories, I understood what aging, death and dying is like, and how we should respect the request of the elderly, terminally ill, or those we just fail to understand.<br />I found this book an inspiration to me, and others.  I cried, laughed, mostly -- I understood what Morrie and Mitch taught us.<br />As the author of A Condition of Limbo, I realized after reading Tuesdays with Morrie, our stories are similar, filled with love, admiration and a new understanding of the terminally ill.

Memento shines from its opening sequence (which just happens to be in reverse) through to the gripping ending. You have read 'edge of your seat' review before, forget them! The performance by Guy Pierce is inspirationally brilliant, and his ability to hold onto such a difficult character is unmatched. Amazingly well pieced together you will be left piecing your own story and you will be talking about this movie for months. Occationally confusing, it is all a part of the story, and you will thank the director for every scene, and the one before- which was the one in front. GO SEE THIS THING- you will not regret it.
0804115613|4.0|Take this one to the beach!  If you loved the movie, if you liked the books or movies Beaches or First Wives Club, you'll love this book.<br />Everyone else very adeptly summarized the story line for you, so I will spare you.<br />Essentially, if you enjoy having tidbits of information with varying voices and time periods thrown helter skelter, this is the book for you.  It has quite a bit of literary strength although it breaks some of the rules.<br />The book does depict a lesbian relationship between the main characters, but does not explore any erotic situations, or cultural implications of their time period.  I thought it was a little odd that no one said anything about two girls in love.  One character lends Idgie the money to start the cafe, because now she has a woman to care for.  Doesn't it seem odd that no one in a tight knit southern community would at all comment on an obvious lesbian relationship in the 20's?<br />Otherwise, it's a wonderful book, full of tall tales and high adventure.  Although you start out hating Evelyn, you can feel the strength growing inside her, as she gathers Idgie's spirit from Ninny's stories.  You cheer her on, and when the final page is read, you begin to think, maybe there's a few more steps I can take, too.<br />Get your copy used from the marketplace sellers right here on amazon.com - always a wonderful experience.

0679746048|4.0|Susanna Kaysen's well-known biography traces her admission into a mental institution while in her late teens.  The book is a fascinating exploration of her journey into and out of the institution, a short book well worth reading.<br />Kaysen is admitted into the institution after a brief visit (how brief is unclear, although the book ultimately settles on 20-30 minutes) who knows nothing about her other than she attempted to kill herself over a relationship problem (a move which she ultimately reconsidered after taking a large dose of aspirin).  Rather than recommending therapy, the doctor ships her over to the institution so she can &quot;rest&quot;.<br />I was expecting a sort of female &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;.  This book is a much kinder, gentler tale, tracing Kaysen's friendships with the other patients, her desire to know what is beyond the institutional walls, and ultimately, her recovery.<br />The main problem I encountered with this book was that I wanted to know more.  Where exactly did the other girls' problems come from?  Why did Kaysen's parents not come to visit her?  Ultimately, Kaysen leaves the hospital, marries, and moves on with her life.  We get foreshadowing that the marriage is doomed, and we know that Kaysen becomes an author.  But I wanted more detail on how this happened.<br />Similarly, the other patients are not sketched in much detail.  Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie in the film, is a psychopath, but we never really know how she got there.  We get a tantalizing glimpse of Lisa near the end, but it's not enough.  The portraits of the other patients are even less detailed.<br />This book is fascinating, but it begs for (dare I say it) a sequel to follow up on the lives of these girls.  While I recommend this book, I would have liked for it to be about twice as long.
0684800713|5.0|The Sun also Rises is a wonderful novel which established Ernest Hemingway as the voice of the Lost generation. Writing in powerful, sporadic prose, Hemingway has the unique ability to bring exotic places to life. Who doesn't yern to see Paris and Spain after reading this book? Hemingway eloquently gives us round characters and tells the story with remarkable mood, and tone. The book as an interesting after-glow to it as well.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool are the best band in the world, period. This album befits that statement. Tho not as good as AEnima (in my opinion). it is still a classic. As with their other albums, it is a complete progession as not many of the songs on this would fit on AEnima or Undertow. its not as heavy either but songs like parabola & ticks & liches will keep you satified it that department. In all its an amazing success, despite the long wait (GRRRRR).  I dont like Schism tho. I dont hate it, it's just my least favorite tool song from any of their albums. i also miss the little interludes from aenima as well (Message from Harry Manback is my personal fav). <br />  Obviously the Death metallers will protest, I can hear their complaints now ( It dosent have enough solos, the lyrics are too complicated, they havent been around for 47 years, they aint singing about death and decay, the case doesnt have a skull on it). But dont listen to them, they just jealous that a band can make a album this good NOW!! While their favorite pensioners are well past it (Except the Sabbath, of course). Remember tho u guys, ALL the sabbath members love Tool (Even Ozzy) as they all watched them at the UK Ozzfest gig this year and stated how great they were in a Kerrang magazinr interview about the UK Ozzfest. so u guys are infact dissing your favorite band when you critise Tool.
B00001ODHL|4.0|this movie is just a blast to watch.  it's a bit of a change up in the evil dead series, it's even more willing to make fun of itself then the previous two movies.  bruce campbell is great, he plays his character with such an absurd seriousness that you just have to laugh whenever he's on the screen.  and while the effects aren't exactly the best in hollywood, they do a fine job and the dvd has a lot of stuff.  just having this cut of the film plus the alternate ending and all makes it worthwhile to me.  and i don't think you need to be a horror fan to enjoy it either..i think this is more of an action film then horror, but maybe that's just me.
083351895X|5.0|Since i've never read a Koontz-Book before this one (i hardly look at books not written by Stephen King) and the cover of the german pocket-book version looks kinda chintzy i expected a solid horror-story á la &quot;Cujo&quot;. What i found instead, is one of the most beautiful and touching stories i've ever read. At the end of this book i cried like i last did after watching one of those heart-breaking boy-and-his-dog-movies when i was 9 years old.<br />The different story-lines are perfectly proportionated, with the (in my opinion) most interesting Nora-Einstein-Travis story-line consuming the most pages, followed by Lem &amp; the Outsider and last-but-not-least Vince.<br />I'll try to get my hands onto some other Koontz books now that i know that there's another storyteller besides King that can make me laugh, fear and even cry in (within?) one single book.<br />I absolutely recommend this book !

B00004WIBW|5.0|Tim Burton is, in my opinion, one of our great visionary filmmakers, and &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is yet another creative triumph. Inspired by the classic 19th century story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&quot; by Washington Irving, this film depicts a United States that is just about to enter the &quot;modern&quot; age. Constable Ichabod Crane (a superb Johnny Depp) is sent to a rural New York village to investigate a series of murders--killings which the locals claim are the work of a supernatural fiend known as the Headless Horseman.<br />&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; works on may levels: as historical &quot;costume drama,&quot; as mystery-thriller, as love story, as fantasy, even as satire. The sets, costumes, make-up, special effects, and sumptuous Danny Elfman score blend marvelously to create an atmosphere that is both creepy and romantic. The filmmakers have assembled an amazing ensemble cast of veteran character actors to support Depp and the luminous Christina Ricci (as Crane's love interest). I was also impressed by Marc Pickering as Young Masbeth, a brave boy who becomes Crane's right-hand man.<br />Depp is excellent in his role, yet another in a series of oddball outsiders and weird &quot;prophets&quot; which he has played to perfection over the years. Depp's Crane is eccentric, comic, heroic, and very appealing.<br />I think it's healthy to be suspicious of attempts to make movies out of literary classics. But &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is an attempt that works. The changes that have been made (most notably, changing Ichabod Crane from a schoolteacher to a police investigator) make sense and are handled deftly by the screenwriters. The gruesome violence may be a bit much for some viewers, but I did not find the violence to be gratuitous; rather, it is well-integrated into the overall plot and atmosphere. Overall, an excellent film.
0553062182|4.0|Dr Aron has done exceptionally well in presenting HSP characteristics that, she provides enough pointers to non-HSPs as to how to cope with HSPs. I would recommende it even to Non-HSPs as they are quite a few learnings for them as well. <br />A must read for every HSP.
6305558175|5.0|The quiet and charming beauty of this film combined with the volatility of love and loss brings about a spell of a tale called Sommersby. The casting was beautifully done, and even though I'm no great fan of Richard Gere, he did a great job in this film. As for Jodie Foster? Great as always :)<br />I found the movie to be fast - moving, refreshing plot-wise, and heartbreaking. (I won't give away the ending!) It's a nice chick - flick, but I think many different types of people will enjoy it, particularly ones who like historical fiction and drama.<br />This film is worth renting.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Everything that needs to be said about this movie has been said, but I'm going to repeat some of it anyway.  It is both hysterically funny and deeply moving.  Roberto Benigni does a great job at juggling both aspects of the movie both as an actor and a director without veering too much towards tearjerker or all-out laugh fest.  Life is Beautiful is a brilliant piece of work that gets better each time I see it and, as if you couldn't guess, I recommend it highly to anyone who hasn't yet.  <br />Now, the DVD is another issue altogether.  The movie looks pretty good and sounds good.  The disk is sufficient in those aspects.  However, for those of you who love extras, they are severly lacking here.  The &quot;making of&quot; featurette has very little to do with the filming but more to do with the attention the movie has received worldwide.  I have seen better documentaries about the movie elsewhere and would have preferred to have one of those included.  You get a theatrical trailer and a string of TV spots that all look the same. The coolest feature is that you can switch between dubbed or subtitles depending on your mood.<br />Overall, the movie is fantastic and because of that the DVD is worth owning by all means. Just don't expect a spectacular disk to go along with this great movie.
0792151712|2.0|Okay, some serious comments now.  It seems an injustice that James Cameron did not suffer the same fate that Michael Cimino endured when his epic film, Heaven's Gate, ended up with massive critical damage.  Titanic was a bad movie that won out by pushing people's visceral buttons rather than by telling the truth about history.  Whether the director's version of that other epic was good or bad will never truly be known since there will never be a definitive DVD or other hommage.<br />Some tired, hackened examples of Cameron's inaccuracies include the cookie-cutter characterizations of his bad guy, the rich snob that would part the heroine from her One True Love.  I mean, when does this really happen?  In reality, the rich girl played by Winslet never would have fallen for the wharf rat played by DiCaprio.  The only character worthy to mention by name is Molly Brown, and she should have had a lot more time on screen.  I would have thought better of a film that spent more time and money on historical research than pyrotechnical special effects.<br />James Cameron, you are most definitely not worthy!

0767817664|5.0|Writer/Director Tom Holland has yet to top himself with this horror masterpiece he created!  The film is all around fantastic.  The DVD could use some more extras though.  Nonetheless, grab this DVD, especially since the price drop!
B00003CXP1|5.0|This Movie actually deserve 6 stars I'm a 15 years old kid and this has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's not just it's an incredible movie. It has the amazing soundtrack by clint mansell

I personally love them all. She is a truly gifted artist.  Now I know I have to order &quot;Watermark&quot; because I love the song &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; also know as &quot;Sail Away&quot;. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves music.

B000002N3J|5.0|After the controversy of EROTICA...Madonna decided to go back to basics. The light, but fun BEDTIME STORIES, and this compilation of her ballads SOMETHING TO REMEMBER, and they are at that.<br />This is a collection of her best ballads, ranging from its earliest a remake of her 1984 cover &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot;, to her most recent &quot;Take A Bow&quot;. There are also some new songs, &quot;I Want You&quot; with Massive Attack, a great ballad that just sweeps over you, she is performing well vocally and musically. &quot;You'll See&quot; is one of her most compelling ballads I've heard in a long time, and a huge hit with the fans, it will always be a classic. &quot;One More Chance&quot; is a beautiful song with great acoustics and vocals.<br />If you loved her hits like &quot;Live To Tell&quot;, &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Oh Father&quot;, &quot;Crazy For You&quot;, etc you will love this cd. It compiles all of her best ballads on one cd, with some excellent new songs as well.

B000008COG|1.0|AC/DC reached an all time low in this one. With VBand and Young again in produuction, this was not enought to release at least an average AC/DC albu, but the worst of them all ever.
B00005KFUN|5.0|...this band rocks.  Buy both Origin of Symmetry along with Showbiz.  I saw them live with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and they are even better live.  The do like to make some unusual sounds and the lead singer often belts out high pitched scream, but that is what is so good about them.  This is the first time that I have ever thought that I would rather live in Europe than America, in order to catch these guys live more often.  Just buy it.
B00000BKE1|1.0|This was the last studio album featuring Dickinson before hje came back to BRAVE NEW WORLD. The signals of strain are clear for all to see here. My God, what are &quot;WEEKEND WARRIOR&quot; and &quot;THE APPARITION&quot; ??!! Two of the wrost Maiden songs in the same CD !! And what about WASTED LOVE ??!! Nothing at all against ballads, but this one is just horrible !!! And what to say about Nickos drums ?? Where did they take this sound from ?? It killed all the majestry fom Nickos playing.. Maiden to be forgotten. And FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, a copy of HOLY SMOKE ??!!! Well, I sold my copy of this CD some days ago, and thats why Im writing this sad review, to make plain for all to see how Maiden declined forever...

I dont inlcude WHO MADE WHO here because it has only a few original tunes, the rest of the track listing is a compilation. Well. THE RAZORS EDGE is, by far, the best of them all, and even so deserves only two stars... WHy? BEcause AC/DC really lost it after FLICK OF THE SWITCH (or FOR THOSE ABOUT, if you prefer to be radical..). WHy do you thing this band started to release an album each five years only ??!! Because they dont like money? No, just because their capacity to write their trademark great rock songs waned definitely.
6305127689|5.0|Top Gun is one of those rare films that you can watch over and over again and never tire of it.  Tom Cruise does a bang-up job as Maverick (Pete Mitchell), a renegade jet pilot with an attitude.  The cast is amazing with Val Kilmer playing Mav's nemesis Iceman, while ER star Anthony Edwards plays Cruise's unforgettable sidekick Goose.  The action sequences in Top Gun are nothing short of breathtaking and will motivate even the toughest cynic to watch and get involved.  The production of Top Gun is so good that it could be released today and still be a huge hit.  Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer did their homework on this one and it shows.  Do not hesitate to buy this DVD, this is the ultimate DVD movie and should be watched at maximum volume.  Highly Recommended.
B00000BKE0|1.0|I dont give it zero star because its Maiden who is playing. I mean, sometimes I have doubts that is Maiden playing, so boring, ludicrous and energyless is their performance in this album. THe debut of Janick Gers was something to be forgotten, but it was not his fault since he does not contribute with songs here. All the songs are loser here, a real achievment for songwriters of the calibre of Harris, Dickinson and Murray.
6304779607|2.0|Cobra was basically a poorly written, badly acted movie that was  successful with audiences only because it was riding the popularity shock wave created by Rambo First Blood Part II. If you don't require a lot from movies to be entertaining, well then its a good flick. The characters have no depth, and what you get is a shabby job of roughemup action Styallone style against ridiculous odds. Stallone's shootemups with the bad guys are really ridiculous, as is the part when he impales the villain on a very blunt, and obviously dull hook at the local foundry. The hand to hand action, although brief was the most exciting part of this film and I wish I had seen more of that. The picture quality was not what I have come to expect from DVDs and the sound was substandard.
0380817683|5.0|I can count on the fingers of one hand the authors I can trust to consistently deliver a quality read.   Marian Keyes is one of them.   I like Marian Keyes so much that I buy her books in hardcover from the UK --- usually at least two years before they come out in the states.  For RACHEL&#8217;S HOLIDAY I actually read a copy from Ireland which is complete with all the Irish slang, I feel is likely missing from the US version.   That said, if you are unfamiliar with Irish slang, the US version will probably be more to your liking.   Marian Keyes books take me &#8220;away&#8221; like few others can.   From a boring transatlantic plane flight to a stressful wait in a hospital waiting room, you can trust Marian Keyes to help you forget your worries.  And be thoroughly entertained.<br />Marian Keyes consistently tackles controversial or serious subjects with wit and humor (in WATERMELON Claire&#8217;s husband announces that he&#8217;s leaving her for another woman &#8211; the day their baby is born; in THE LAST CHANCE SALOON a group of singles from Ireland living in London tackle issues such as obesity and homosexuality).  In RACHEL&#8217;S HOLIDAY, Keyes again gives us a serious subject, substance abuse, but presents it in such a way that has readers will be laughing out loud.   That&#8217;s not to say she glorifies it, but with Rachel&#8217;s narration, readers feel the sadness at her situation, and is also caught smiling at the circumstances Rachel finds herself in.  Particularly funny was one of the flashbacks where she and her friend Brigit are in a pub in Manhattan and finally figure out instead of the group of men friends who also frequent the place each having a pair of leather pants, they apparently each wear the same pair on a different night.<br />Rachel Walsh (who readers may remember as the sister of Claire of WATERMELON fame), at her family&#8217;s insistence after an accidental drug overdose, has returned home to Ireland from New York City where she&#8217;s lived for the past few years.  Her father has secured her admission to The Cloisters, a substance abuse treatment facility south of Dublin in the Wicklow Hills.  Rachel denies she has a problem but figures she could use a vacation. Known as the place where celebrities go to &#8220;dry out&#8221; Rachel expects to find herself in a luxury spa-like facility, not the stark reality she discovers The Cloisters to be.   <br />But the subject matter isn&#8217;t the only thing that propels RACHEL&#8217;S HOLIDAY from &#8220;just another chick lit&#8221; novel to an extraordinary read for any woman of any age.  It&#8217;s the perfectly timed turn of phrase from Keyes via Rachel&#8217;s voice.  It&#8217;s the extraordinary cast of secondary characters.  It&#8217;s the sense of place.  To put it quite simply, this is another outstanding offering from Marian Keyes.
0553213105|2.0|I thought this book would be a lot better than what it turned out to be... for my summer reading requirements i came across this book title and went to this site, amazon.com to see what it was like.... all reviews seemed to be saying that it was an excellent book, yet when i picked it up, i had the hardest time getting past the 10th chapter, i didn't really understand it or discover all that others had... if you have this book on your list for high school reading, be sure you have a lot of free time because you need to read it over quite a few times to understand all aspects of the language, trends, and characters of the story, a modernized version would be a much better one to understand.... this book was written a bit too long ago for me!
6300214559|4.0|The story of the real Lady Jane, tragic and fascinating, would make a wonderful screen play. Unfortunately, the writers of this film's script adapted a few facts and sandwiched stock, pat fiction in between.<br />Helena Bonham Carter, at once beautiful and earnest, does give the viewer a flavour of the intellectual, devout, and manipulated Jane, and the acting, scenery, and music are first rate and the reason for my high rating. There is a sense of Edward VI's concern for the sucession, how Jane was used as a pawn, and such historical truths as, for example, how the poor were reduced to destitution when there no longer was monastery land to farm.<br />Beyond that, the circumstances of Jane's life and brief reign are so distorted as to make the book verge on the farcical. Whatever factors there were in Jane's situation, no part of it was in any way a &quot;love story.&quot; The depiction of the madly romancing couple managing all sorts of reforms (for example, &quot;their shilling&quot;) within a matter of a week practically reduces Jane's story to camp. One could get the absurd impression that Jane's being manipulated, even beaten, into a marriage with Dudley was a piece of good fortune with a happy, if brief, outcome.<br />Of course, those who believe that history in no way matters are welcome to compose fictional love stories... but, when anyone had as intriguing a true story as did Jane, it is preferable for such love stories to not borrow her name.
0312853238|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I couldn't put it down.  The characters are complex and well-defined, and the way the world treats these genius children will really make you think.  Ender is superhuman, but lovable and sympathetic.  A must-read.
B00004U2HK|2.0|With its having been well over thirty years since I saw this film, a recent, second viewing let me see just how dreadful it was. Fortunately, there is no diabetes in my family, or the very viewing would have sent me into insulin shock.<br />I well remember the era when this was produced, when much excellent music, drama, and comedy was available without their being scenes to offend anyone. I imagine Sound of Music will be popular today because, in a quite different climate, it is &quot;for the whole family.&quot; I shall pause here for a long sigh, adding that, if one of any age is looking for any sort of plot, theme, realism, dramatic action, or characterisation, the well here is dry. All that rescues this farce (besides Eleanor Parker's lines, in which I heartily concur) is Julie Andrews' glorious voice and the stunning scenery of Salzburg.<br />One progresses from the company of nuns who are cartoon characters, to the spunky governess who transforms kids and captain just with a few cheery songs, to a picturesque escape over a non-existent mountain. During the tense, climactic scene when the Von Trapps are hiding from the Nazis, little Gretl (in an unintentionally funny line) captures the story's theme, as she asks Maria, &quot;Do you think it would help if we sang 'Our Favourite Things?'&quot; One nearly expects Maria to say that it would!
0812550757|5.0|Okay, so I'm a fan of sentient trees.  Aside from that, this is an amazing novel.  Ender's grown up, but hasn't lost his charm or lovability.  In fact, life has giving him a unique ability to understand people, and why they do the thing they do.  A wonderful novel.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Ok, first of all I', giving it two, because it was watchable.  But lets compare.<br />Now of course the original movies were designed with plenty of cliche's and sillyness, but they tell a good story, certainly linked to mythology, and for the most part make sense.  Now its a known fact that lucas brought innovations in movie making in episodes 4 + 5 (ANH, ESB), but these were for story telling, not innovations for the sake of it.  I would argue that lucas has done so much with ILM and CG, that any new innovations were made for the sake of it.  I would also argue that unlike the previous movies, plot was built around these effects.  In the previous trilogy, the effects were build around the plot.  Jar-jar is the perfect example.  He can be explained away by the need to have the gundam (spelling?) forces during the final battle, but thats just a poor recreation of the ewoks.  Heres why: as annoying as we found the ewoks, there was a point:  technology alone doesnt win.  A less advanced force could win.  The ewok in ROTJ did it well, even if we as fans didnt like it.  The Droid/Gungam thing was just poor.  As was the anakin destroying the Droid Control Ship.  No point, other than to have anakin do it.  His winning the podrace was more than enough.  It was in fact, too much of a rip of the original movie.  <br />Maul was an interesting character, but the audience never got to learn about him.    And then theres the movie itself... it was designed so you have to see it twice to understand lots of the lines in the beginning.  Ca-Ching!!!<br />Finally, a word to Mr. Lucas:  We're not stupid.  We do remember past statements, even though you claim they werent made.  (PErfect example: on the Spec edition tapes, he talks about all 9 episodes, all written, although he doubted the last 3 would be made, that he had written it as 3 trilogies from the beginning).  3 years later, he says this is something someone else made up.  PErsonally, when i saw it, once the star wars euphoriawore off, it seemed to me like a movie with little thought into the script, and most into the effects.  Even putting aside the expectations, it was not a &quot;Star Wars&quot; quality of movie.
B00004TH83|5.0|It's been little over a year since I first bought this CD.  I enjoyed it immensely and it even became my August 2000 employee pick at my workplace at Sam Goody.<br />Then, on 12 August 2001, PBS premiered From Lara With Love, a program consisting of a concert intercut with interviews which showcased tunes from her eponymously-titled English language debut and some of her previous foreign language albums, including Pure.  It was like falling in love with her all over again.<br />Some of the music and styles remind me of Celine Dion tunes, interesting considering how both are Canadians.  &quot;I Am Who I Am&quot; and &quot;You Are My Heart&quot; are examples of this and while Celine wouldn't have trouble singing them, there's something in Lara's vocal style that places her over Dion.  The thing that clinches her lead over Dion is her personal style.  She is the prime example of European singers who don't care about the star system or entering the &quot;renowned&quot; hall of divas, as I learned during the PBS pledge break.  Then again, it could be the passionate Italian in her inherited from her mother's heritage.<br />&quot;Love By Grace&quot; is a Mariahesque song with the same soaring vocals but at the right level that soothes the listener, especially the chorus's of repetitive melody:  &quot;I didn't come here to leave you/I didn't come here to lose/I didn't come here believing...&quot;<br />When she spoke of &quot;Yeliel (My Angel)&quot; and how she envisioned angels not as heavenly beings with wings but that certain gentle person there to protect and love us, I suddenly realized how angelic Lara herself was!  She could be anyone's angel hands down.  I would definitely be proud to introduce her to my parents and they would be enchanted to meet her in return.<br />The breakthrough dance single &quot;I Will Love Again&quot; is followed by the song she described as a special song, one about betrayed love and forgiveness--&quot;Broken Vow.&quot;  This song, along with &quot;Love By Grace,&quot; highlights her vocal talents.  Now THAT is the way to sing a love ballad.  The more I hear it, the more I enjoy it.  An Italian version of &quot;Adagio,&quot; which I like better than the English language version, brings Lara's album full circle.<br />Some of this album was produced by Walter Afanasieff of Mariah Carey and Celine Dion fame, and his arrangements show.  With Celine Dion in temporary retirement and Mariah gradually losing the spotlight, this would be a perfect opportunity to move Lara Fabian to her proper throne as, no, not the queen of pop, but the angel of pop.h &quot;Love By Grace,&quot; highlights her vocal talents.

0553573403|5.0|I found myself getting caught up in the individual lives of the various characters, it was great. There is plenty of action as well as meaningful dialog and it managed to keep my interest thoughout the book. My largest problem with the series so far is that there are a lot of loose ends that never seem to get tied up by the end of the book.
B000002UB3|5.0|In The Compleat Beatles documentary, George Martin recalls Paul coming over to him and asking him if he'd make an album for the Beatles, just like the old days.  Martin replied, \\"If you'd let me.\\"  Hence, another Beatles classic, Abbey Road, was born.<br />I've gotten a better appreciation of Abbey Road over the years.  Maybe it's because I'm getting on in years.  Maybe it's that classic album cover of the foursome walking along the zebra crossing.  I don't know.<br />This album was also known for the varying rock tunes for John and pop for Paul.  And there was very little of the fancy studio techniques that made Sgt Peppers a classic.  No, this is a plain and simple album, and for that, it's splendid.<br />Ringo's only song here is \\"Octopus's Garden\\" and it is a fantasy-like song like \\"Yellow Submarine.\\"  The Fabs really have a penchant for fantasy-like places--Strawberry Fields, Pepperland, and now, an octopus's garden.  Magic!<br />\\"Something\\", sung by George, is a slow dreamy song that's just lovely to the ears.  This is the song to which Mike free associates in Doonesbury, and ends up hating the song because it reminded him of a girl he met who eventually left him for a football player.<br />The \\"Golden Slumbers\\" medley is my favorite part.  \\"The End\\" is poignantly appropriate.  Okay, so it is the penultimate song on Abbey Road, \\"Her Majesty\\" being snipped away from \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and put to the end, but with \\"The End,\\" a movie's playing in my head.  They are playing that song in the studio and as they hit that last note, the screen freezing, the words \\"The End\\" a la movie captions appearing, then a fade-out.<br />In the end, this was the Beatles' last gasp to \\"come together.\\"  \\"Come Together\\" they did, and they might have done again after their breakup, but tragedy intervened.  Put together with Let It Be, Abbey Road is a bittersweet testimony of the legendary legacy the Fab Four left behind.
B00000IUT7|4.0|I was completely disappointed at how short of a time it lasted in our house with my 2 year old son. It did not make it up the hills and seemed to lose power very quickly. We had purchased the smaller of the two battery powered locomotives previously so I was expecting a little more quality out of this one. I have to say that the smaller engine was much stronger and more durable than the larger more expensive one. We are going back to the smaller one, which lasted months instead of days. Yet another expensive purchase down the drain :(
B000002L7R|5.0|Which came first, the label or the song?  Well, whatever the case, once upon a time, a song called &quot;Paisley Park&quot; was written.  It was a wonderful paradise where the sky was richly blue and the clouds hung like the fleece on the fattest sheep, with white doves flying overhead.  Foremost about this place was the mountains, which were a quilt of colors, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, pink, purple, and black.  And standing around a swimming pool bordered by marigolds, were a cast of characters, which either represented the nine songs or were musicians on the album.<br />I'm describing the album cover of Around The World In A Day, the psychedelic pop followup to Prince's masterpiece, Purple Rain.<br />&quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; is an all-time classic that needs no introduction.  The video for it is my favorite video period, and it contained elements of the album cover.  The girl with the beret is wearing a long black robe and holding a raspberry (or is it an apple?) on the album cover.<br />&quot;Paisley Park&quot; describes a pleasant utopia as an alternative to all the troubles in the world.  It's a place where people are happy, forgive those who have wronged them, There's even a poke at Republicans--&quot;Whoever said that elephants were stronger than mules?&quot;  Both girl in the seesaw and the black man who's block is condemned figure on the album cover.  Yes, she does look happy, doesn't she?  I mean, life SHOULD be this happy, at a place where you want to stay for the rest of your life, where the people are filled with &quot;profound inner peace.&quot;<br />Whenever I hear &quot;Condition Of The Heart&quot; I am filled with a pleasant inner melancholy that sets my mind adrift.  It's songs like this that, to reverse the lyric from Nirvana's &quot;Lithium,&quot; that provide &quot;the comfort in being sad.&quot;<br />Ditto with &quot;The Ladder&quot; which is about the search for one's soul and personal salvation.  I sometimes feel that I am that king who didn't know where he's going, except for me, it's not the land of Sinaplenty--it's Nosoul.  The lush string arrangements, backing vocals by Wendy and Susannah Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, and gospel choir of &quot;The Ladder,&quot; a song about the search for personal salvation, make it one of my favorite Prince songs.<br />&quot;America&quot; opens with a blasting chords before launching into a rocking beat from a strong fuzzy guitar.  It is the only sociopolitical song here, with verses describing the upper classes and their preoccupation in making money and equating a Democratic or left-of-center change in the government with communism, a woman who barely makes ends meet in the &quot;one room monkey cage&quot; where she lives, and a boy disillusioned with this country to the extent that he sees nothing but an impending apocalypse.  The song still seems topical today, as there seems to be little left to be proud of in this country.<br /> &quot;Pop Life&quot; is a song on the way people cope with their miserable life, whether it is someone who didn't get an envelope from Ed McMahon, children staying out of school, or people taking drugs to evade life's harsh realities.  I like in particular the lyric &quot;The river of addiction flows... but there won't be no water when the fire blows.&quot;<br />Sometimes, I feel that the only places I want to go exist in fantasy or songs.  There's Pepperland, Strawberry Fields, and then there's Paisley Park.  I'll say this--if I ever gain entrance to the Park, I ain't never coming back!<br />&quot;Temptation&quot;, with its distorted psychedelic guitar is the closest as Prince will ever get to heavy metal.  I assume that the person embodying that song is the red be-wigged man in the black bodysuit eating the ice cream cone.<br />Anyone else who made an album like Around The World In A Day after a megasmash like Purple Rain would probably see their career come tumbling down due to an alienated audience.  Only a genius like Prince can carry such a radical change in musical style to sound perfection.nce can carry such a radical change in musical style to sound perfection.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Just the best album of all time.  I have been playing this since I bought it, first in the mid-80's on tape (which I wore out) and now on CD.  Dire Straights at the peak of their sound.  And the recording!  Recording quality is astounding.
087788630X|5.0|G.K. Chesterton came to his belief in Christianity through the &quot;back door&quot;, so to speak. He found the existing philosophies of the time illogical, formulated his own, and then found that what his own philosophy resembled most of all was Christianity. Christianity, to Chesterton, gives one much more freedom than liberalism. <br />While this is an often entertaining read, it takes an alert mind to grasp all that Chesterton is saying in this book. This is one of those texts, like Lewis' &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, that stands the test of time, and is worth having on one's shelf to peruse again and again for nuggets of wisdom.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I like this album because in a world of bands screaming noises, like Disturbed's exclamation of \\"OHAHAHAHAH!\\", or claiming they are taking rap metal new places like Crazy Town and Disturbed, it stands out and says we're gonna be original, powerful and completely kick [butt] without being cliche.  Cedric Bixler's lyrics are completely cryptic and definately not easily understood.  My favorite song on the cd has to be Invalid Litter Department because of the sonically assaulting guitars and the stream of conciousness delivery of the lyrics in which Cydric seems to be just yelling what comes to mind in a self assured way that it makes sense.  The guitar and groves in the cd are many and complex such as in Mannequin Republic where everything slows down into a riff that sounds like a stuttering car wreck.  All in all if you want a different flavor to enhance your musical horizons go for ATDI's Relationship of Command.
6300182770|5.0|For folks who aren't devoted fans of Cronenberg, mention &quot;Videodrome&quot; and most will say &quot;isn't that the weird SM movie with Debby Harry of Blondie?&quot;  James Woods stars opposite Deborah Harry as the owner of a Canadian cable TV station, looking for the latest in adult thrills and low-cost programming.  Harry is a radio therapist/personality who gets involved with Woods and Videodrome.  Given the rise in cable TV and reality programming of 2001, this now 20 year old film is like an eerie glimpse into the seedy side of modern entertainment.  Great f/x, fantastic kinky scene where Woods' pierces Harry's ears while they make love.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|How can a man with short term memory loss investigate a murder?  The answer is so interesting you just have to see if for yourself.  Don't let the extreme violence of the opening scene put you off.  This is exactly the kind of movie you need to have in your DVD library.  You'll want to watch it more then once to understand all the things that go on and there is MUCH that goes on!  I hate a film that I can figure out too quickly, which is why this is a movie I highly recommend.  In a year filled with  scores of simply BAD movies, this one will naturally stand out.

My mom hates marilyn manson but after she read this book she now has respect for my taste. i knew a lot about manson when i read this book, yet there were things in there i didn't even know. if you are a diehard manson fan or just a fan you will find this book to be a great way to spend time
6302968135|5.0|One of the best films I have ever seen, and I am happy to watch it over and over again when I want to watch something worth while. A fast paced film with plenty of surprises as each person journys through life. This film makes me laugh, yet has its moments of sadness, which reflect what live is all about. The best is that no matter what happens, and how people turn out, we can all learn to forgive and love each of our friends and family forever. A must see film for those interested in films which at least have some depiction of real life and not some bullshit over budget hollywood blockbuster. A real story with real characters. A film we can all relate too.
B00000IAU3|5.0|At first listen, the sheer beauty of Dido's music will sweep you away. Each track is crafted with a different feel to it, so each one is an experience. Songs like Here With Me, Hunter, Isobel and Thank You are unique in their originality, not only of music but lyrics as well. Don't Think Of Me, All You Want and I'm No Angel are worthy themes for any girl getting over a break up and My Lover's Gone and Take My Hand are beautifully done. Dido's voice is lovely and her lyrics are well written. This CD is an essential for any collection and is wonderful for background in addition to a great listen.
B00000064G|5.0|The is a profoundly moving album. Even more so if you are familar with Nick Drakes other work. His other albums are filled with sad beauty. This one is filled with despair. The voice of a man past cracking up. He sounds already gone. The music is sparse, the melodies simple, the lyrics hardly there at all. Why do I like this album then...it's hard to say - it fills me with sadness, makes me depressed...maybe it just reminds me that no matter how far down I go there's someone who has been further.
B000002BBY|3.0|I'd rate this three and 1/2 stars if I could, because it's got 4 standout songs on it.  Certainly, it's worth owning for them alone.  The four tracks are, in my opinion: Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger, Morning Glory, and Champaigne Supernova.<br />Despite what others have said, I'd have to rate the rest of this album as throw-away, especially &quot;Hey Now.&quot; Songs like &quot;She's Electric&quot; sound OK but suffer from weak lyrics.  The overall problem on this album is that Oasis is trying too hard to sound like something.  They're trying to sound Beatles-esque instead of playing what comes naturally for them.  (To me, this is true for the music and lyrics, but more so for the lyrics.)  Even the good songs exhibit this: &quot;Gonna start a revolution from my bed...&quot;  Gee, you mean like JOHN LENNON did?<br />The first song I heard off this album was Wonderwall, which is a sweet, sincere song.  This album is well worth buying if you like the tunes, but I feel it could've used more sincerety overall.
6303022901|5.0|I never got the chance to read the stoery ,but i did see the movie it was a very heartfelt story one that i could look at over and over again for years to come.Good Work Miss Tan.
B0000004V2|5.0|I can safely say that this album is probably the finest debut ever made, if not the finest album altogther.  The album is timeless and one can lose themselves in a make believe world of sunshine and pure bliss when listening to its eleven perfect tunes.  From the opening song of i wanna be adored through to the majestic i am the ressurection each song is an individual classic blending to become an amazing sound.<br />The first time i heard the album i was hooked and from then (i bought it in 1995) on it is still my most listened to album. Whatevr mood youre in it will add that feeling of hope and euphoria into your mind.<br />There are many highlights of this album but mine must be the beautiful 'made of stone' with its brilliant guitar solo and ian browns haunting vocals.  Another most amazing part of this album is the fact that its not too commercial and is still a gem to find by many people.<br />It is felt that the stone roses have influenced many bands such as oasis through to lesser known bands as puressence but one thing is for sure is that it has influenced anyone who has bought it and made them feel so much better.
0783225725|5.0|Clint Eastwood reprises his cigar-smoking, whisky-swilling, sharp-shootin'  Western hero, but with a significantly darker aspect in this film.  Eastwood's no Kurosawa or Leone, and his direction is less interested in building dramatic tension, sweeping over the brown Western desertscapes, or focusing in on the eyes of hardened gunfighters.  Rather, this is a psychological Western, zooming in on the cowardly inhabitants of Lago and Eastwood's violent and total domination of them.<br />Frequent flashbacks of a brutal - and unjust - whipping that took place before Eastwood's arrival eventually explain the protagonist's behavior, which includes several cold-blooded murders and two [forced couplings] that must rank among the most anti-feminist moments in modern cinema.  First a cheap hussy, then a respected townswoman fall under the spell of Eastwood's [member].  A midget gets appointed sheriff and mayor, and turns the tables on his tormentors.  No one gets shot in the back, but that's about the only depth of human depravity not plumbed here.  By the time the final scene arrives, you share the directorial disgust with the town he's created, and the murderous denouement is welcome.<br />The music is nowhere near as good as Ennio Morricone's, and the DVD transfer adds nothing to the mono soundtrack.  Picture quality is OK - no better.  The chapter index is decent, but skip the DVD extras - a set of cast bios and an Eastwood filmography.<br />Great fun, but don't play it for the kiddies - stick to 'A Fistful of Dollars' for that.
0385486804|5.0|This is a fascinating tale of an ill fated young man, and how his thirst for adventure and a different life in the wilderness led to his untimely demise.  It is a scholarly piece, well researched with gentle sensitivity, and all in all paints an evokative picture of Chris McCandless and his days travelling the vast north American continent.<br />Of equal interest are the other tales of equally ill fated young men who have chosen similar lives, and the author's own hair-raising adventures, which put an interesting perspective on the topic.<br />It is really an engtossing tale, which reminds me in many ways of &quot;A Perfect Storm&quot;.  It's well written, a fascinating topic, and an interesting insight into those people who will always live in the fringes of our society.
B000059XYK|5.0|first of all i would like to say do not take those other reviews seriously. Gone was a well written movie and had an exciting story line. heck i even thought it was better than Pearl Harbor. It had great action sequences and comedy. what more do u ask for from a older movie redone. it was great go get it. or &quot;lets ride&quot;!!!
0345350472|5.0|Highly original novel, it's not all about &quot;andys&quot; and the people who retire them for a living but instead introduces a very unsettling (yet entertaining) &quot;alternate&quot; version of the future, a future dominated by &quot;kipple&quot; (you gotta read it to find out) and weird, competing religious cults.
B0000028W9|5.0|I love music, all music, yet this man is a true hypnotis. I've listened to many different singers with many having a truly unique voice and sense of delivery and none compares to Leonard Cohen. I like music so it injures my sense of diplomacy to say that there has never been a comparison to this man in either songwriting ability or the ability to wrap you in his spell with an ever changing voice. This is a must for anyone, Cohen fan or otherwise. From the start this CD takes you on one journey after another....a little cynical in &quot;The Future, a little humility in &quot;Waiting for a Miracle&quot;, insecurity in &quot;Be For Real&quot;, observant in &quot;Closing Time&quot;,wisdom in &quot;Anthem&quot;,nationalistic in &quot;Democracy&quot;,erotically sensual and bitter in &quot;Light as the  Breeze&quot;,committed monogomy in &quot;Always&quot; and then yearnings in the sounds of &quot;Tacoma Trailer&quot;. It is hard to say I have a Cohen favorite yet this is one.
B000002KB8|4.0|When Black Sabbath came out in 1970, critics couldn't understand what they were listening to.  Sadly, what is not understood is often hated.  Critics found it easier to trash the band's music rather than to take the time to make an effort toward understanding it.  Which is a shame because this album still stands up today.  Considering that Black Sabbath had a very small amount of resources - time and money especially - in which to make this album, it sounds amazing.  Even though Tony Iommi's guitar is quite dominant, Geezer Butler's bass and Bill Ward's drums are still clear and audible.  Nothing is drowned out or given too much volume.  Out of all the Ozzy-era albums, this one has the best production.<br />The album starts off with &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;.  This song is a slow gothic number that is brilliant in its simplicity.  Instead of sounding like it was done in a hurry, the band seemed to savor every note as it came out.  Not much in the way of techincal genius, but dramatic and powerful.<br />The second cut is &quot;The Wizard&quot;.  Black Sabbath gave Led Zeppelin a run for their money in the funky blues department.  Ozzy plays a harmonica and Bill Ward's drumming is in top form.  Any classic rock station that doesn't play this should just drop the pretense and change their format to Top-40.<br />&quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot; and &quot;N.I.B.&quot; from what I can tell started out as jams that evolved into two separate songs that were connected by Butler's bass solo.  &quot;Behind...&quot; is quite creepy for 1970 standards.  &quot;N.I.B.&quot; is the mandatory love song for the album - a love song from Hell.  Iommi makes his guitar sing on these two tracks.<br />&quot;Wicked World&quot; was a reflection of what was wrong with the world in 1970.  The lyrics may seem a little dated, but the musicianship is awesome.  I especially love the jazzy intro.<br />Last but not least is the song that so many people dislike.  It is listed as &quot;A Bit of Finger / Sleeping Village / Warning&quot;, but some simply call it &quot;Evil Woman&quot; - out of laziness I'm going to call it that too.  Sabbath was kind of out of their element.  &quot;Evil Woman&quot; would have worked better if it was shortened down to about four or five minutes.  Not that I have anything against jam sessions, but this one would have been better on a live album in my opinion.  The section ( on this album) that would have contained the jam session would have been better utilized if one or two different songs were present in its place.  I do not dislike this track, I just think the band was better at songs with structure than jamming.<br />All things considered, this album is still a classic.  It might not be Black Sabbath at their best, but it is still required owning for anyone who calls themselves a fan.<br />Overall rating: 4.5 stars.of Finger / Sleeping Village / Warning&quot;, but some simply call it &quot;Evil Woman&quot; - out of laziness I'm going to call it that too.

B000001DQI|5.0|After being treated to the multi-million selling, mega-smash &quot;Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player&quot;, the millions upon millions of Elton John's already established fans were most likely wondering &quot;What could possibly top that masterpiece?&quot; If that was their thought, well, they were almost correct. EJ's 1973 follow-up, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, may not top &quot;Don't Shoot Me...&quot; both musically or lyrically, but &quot;GYBR&quot; is as just as masterful a work as &quot;DSM...&quot; on both artistic fronts. But, what gives &quot;...Yellow Brick Road&quot; its magical touch, is the rather diversive musical/ lyrical textures and stylings featured throughout this CD, which is really a double album containing 76 minutes of music at its sheer, ultra-rocking best. &quot;GYBR&quot; starts off with a chilling feel, with the hauntingly spooky &quot;Funeral For A Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)&quot;. The first half of this track is an instrumental, while the second half kicks into maximum overdrive, courtesy of Elton's aggressively rough-edged powerful vocals and his hard-hitting band, who provide some serious licks, particularly in the rhythm section on guitar by the one and only Davey Johnstone. In comparing both original versions of &quot;Grey Seal&quot; (which appeared on Elton's second self-titled album as a bonus track) and &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; to the remakes, the revamped version of the former track is most likely the preferred version among Elton fans (myself included), with its progressively up-tempo syncopation, although the slower-paced, ballad type version is suitable (although I've only heard snippets of the original). As for both studio and live versions of &quot;Candle...&quot;, both are equal, with Elton's more powerful, rough and melancholy vocals, as well as classical piano nimblings featured beautifully in the live version, making it more suitable to the fact-based biographical lyrics of one of Hollywood's best known starlets, Marilyn Monroe. In keeping with the movies, there's &quot;I've Seen That Movie Too&quot;, complete with the CD booklet's ultra-hip, cool artwork - displaying a scene from &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, of Clark Gable (as Rhett Butler) and Vivien Leigh (as Scarlett O'Hara), who seem to be enjoying a romantic moment, via a kiss. Adding to the plethora of those diversive musical styles, is the reggae-ish &quot;Jamaica Jerk-Off&quot;, recorded in Jamaica, as was &quot;Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting&quot;, one of &quot;GYBR's many hit singles, with the latter number featuring driven-home, serious rock 'n roll, once again carried out very solidly by Elton's band (as a further note of interest, &quot;GYBR&quot; was the third album recorded mostly at Strawberry Studios in France, with two of the above tracks &quot;Jamaica Jerk-Off&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night's&quot;..., recorded in Jamaica, as noted above). The album's other singles, &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot;, &quot;Harmony&quot; and the title track, are hypnotically romantic and sensible, particularly the latter two, with the former being good glamourized rock 'n roll. EJ's 1950's rock influences are showcased in the speedily up-tempo &quot;Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock 'n Roll)&quot;. There's also a bit of a hook of &quot;Madman Across The Water&quot; prominently displayed in &quot;Dirty Little Girl&quot;, a song centering around the ring of prostitution. &quot;Social Disease&quot; is a colorful look at alcoholism, which explains the nature of Elton and Bernie Taupin's lighthearted, jovial musical and lyrical nature of the album's songs (I'm not suggesting that neither Elton nor Bernie have ever taken to the bottle on a consistent basis - this analogy just happened to come out that way. Sorry!). Thus, this is most likely the album in which EJ and Bernie were having the most fun during their six year partnership at the time. After writing mostly melancholy tunes on the previousalbums, both EJ and Bernie probably thought: &quot;Hey, why don't we throw our usually (wonderfully) depressive ideas to the wind and see if anything uniquely unusual comes up.&quot; That it did. The result was a more dynamic, laid-back masterpiece, which Taupin and John later explored in future efforts. The snazzy, semi-cartoonish, semi-dramatic and visually stunning CD booklet artwork is simply a joy to behold, which says a lot for the musical and lyrical content inside, and is perhaps the finest of EJ's and Bernie's early period. Success would continue to shine for these two genuinely unique players, who provide the best compositions the world of rock music has to offer. So, take that georgeous walk down the yellow brick road to your local record store today, and get a copy of &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;.

0385335482|3.0|I WISH THIS BOOK had more shopping involved.  There were some boring parts like when she visits her parents (yawn).  I was looking forward to a book about uncontrollable shopping but it was a book more about jobs, roomates, parents, social and love life and it's these things that drive her to be a shopaholic.  NOT ENOUGH FASHION :(.  But I read it twice and the second time around I laughed out loud at the character she is adorable once u know her.  I also didn't like the fact that the scene is in LONDON where I can't relate :(.  Wish it took place HERE in the U. S. daym.
0790749815|5.0|Slap yourself if you haven't seen this movie. Although not as complex as &quot;Vertigo&quot; or &quot;Rear Window,&quot; this is Hitchcock at his most enjoyable. I can't even begin to count the number of contemporary action films that were infulenced by (and frequently rip off) this. The crop-duster scene continues to be possibly one of the best suspense scenes I've ever seen, and it was only done with a plane, an empty field, and Cary Grant. The cast is perfect, the script is full of surprises and funny in a smart kind of way that modern moviemaking just doesn't understand. James Mason just oozes evil charisma.<br />So, how's the DVD? Incredible. I can't believe it ever looked this good, even on the big screen. The color separation is vivid and sharp, and I only noticed two or three imperfections in the print, which is amazing considering the age of this film. The stereo separation and noise reduction are great. Bernard Hermann's score, one of the most brilliant and propulsive I've ever heard, is absolutely transparent. And, of course, the stereo panning during the crop-duster sequence is spot-on. Oh yeah, and it includes the original theatrical trailer, as well as a mock commercial done by Hitchcock himself extolling the virtues of Mt. Rushmore as a tourist attraction!

B000003CKH|2.0|This band deserves praise simply for daring to be different.  The problem is, sometimes it sounds as if this group is trying too hard for that quirky appeal.  Despite the eclectic sound (the meandering trumpet is an interesting addition, and actually works), this stuff is surprisingly accessible if you have ears that are attuned to late 90s alternative rock. <br />&quot;The Distance&quot; is an instant classic, and will be on all the compilation albums when this music is old enough to merit nostalgia.  As for the rest of the CD  . . . well, if you want to know what it will sound like in 20 years, try playing anything on &quot;Get the Knack&quot; besides &quot;My Sharona&quot;:   What were we thinking?
B00005LMBK|1.0|I bought this CD thinking that I was going to get a hybrid of Del the funky homosapien and Blur. Unfortunatly what I got was 1 decent song with Del, 1 average song with Del, and the rest a bunch of experimental garbage. with te exception of song 5, this cd has no merit. It is just a bunch filler and electronic sounds with absolutely no coevsiveness throughout the entire album. one only has to listen to track 12 (the lyrics which are entirely in spanish) to realize how truly terrible this album is. If get this album excepting songs similar to Clint Eastwood you will be sorely dissapointed to find experinmetnal Kid-A-esque noise with no musical talent anywhere within the album.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Fans of Hollywood endings and/or happy flicks probably would not be a fan of this beautiful movie. Many critics comment on the length of the film (3hours) but I believe every moment is vital. The mood of the story is somber but there are many funny moments throughout Magnolia. Tom Cruise is amazing and provides much of the comic relief in the beginning of the film. Anyone that has lived with regret would relate to this film. And when the credits roll, there will be many questions in the viewer's head. I watched this film numerous times (a sign of a good movie) and it gets better each time. Fans of intelligent cinema will enjoy this gem.
0787120294|4.0|Read and written by the author, this audio version of a love story so passionate, so powerful, so potent, is a great mind escape for a few hours. I found myself lost in the soft lull of Robert James Waller's voice as he took me to Madison County, Iowa, and showed me the covered bridges, the fields and meadows, the sunrises and sunsets, and the truest love in the history of time. Francesca is an Iowa farm wife, who meets Robert Kincaid, writer, photographer, from Bellingham, Washington one hot, dusty day when he stops at her farm for directions. What follows is a love story so profound and so moving, you will wish you had experienced it yourself. It IS a bit sappy, and I wished for a lighter tone on occasion, to take away the inherent sadness that permeated the story turned fairy-tale turned story again. Francesca and Robert must make a painful choice, one of great sorrow and heartache that they will have to live with and abide by the rest of their days. The story was told to the author by Francesca's two children after Francesca's death. After reading her journals, looking at pieces of her life Francesca kept in a manila envelope and finally realizing the depth of what their mother had to say, Michael and Carolyn decide that this is a story that very much needs to be told. It is the Romeo and Juliet of the 20th century, two star-crossed lovers torn by family and love, separated by miles of responsibility and heart ache, words waiting to be heard. Francesca and Robert come to represent that part of us that lives for what we know we want, what we know we must have, and what a very few of us ever really find.
B0000028MA|5.0|I was really young when this soundtrack came out, so I missed it, along with the heyday of all the bands on it... still, to add to the cliche, this is the best soundtrack of the nineties, and probably the best soundtrack ever... I used to think the crow soundtrack took that honor (it did have two very amazing songs by the cure and nin), but this is just overall better. &quot;state of love and trust&quot;, &quot;chloe dancer/crown of thorns&quot;, &quot;drown&quot;, &quot;would?&quot; - the list goes on. amazing. wish mtv still played music like this - wish new bands still made music like this... as a piece of youth known for limp bizkit and n sync, i feel truly cheated...
B000000OAH|2.0|Queens's brand of catchy pop metal was hugely popular in the 70s, but now it all pretty much sounds the same. This album includes the singles `Fat Bottom Girls' and `Bicycle Race', a dubious benefit. If you a casual fan, you probably would be best of with a greatest hits, there is nothing especially inspiring here.
0780622650|1.0|I don't know who William Hurt owed a favor to, but someone really took advantage of his friendship. Other excellent thespians displayed in this intergalactic meltdown include Gary Oldman (&quot;Sid and Nancy,&quot; &quot;The Professional&quot;), Mimi Rogers (&quot;X-Files&quot;) and Heather Graham (&quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;).<BR><BR>In this version of Irwin Allen's campy 60's tv show, the Robinsons are a bickering bunch of nitwits. Joey from &quot;Friends&quot; flies them across the galaxy and loses them, while Claudia from &quot;Party of Five&quot; complains almost nonstop that he didn't lose them enough. Or something like that. They battle biomechanical spiders, the evil Dr. Smith (Oldman, of course) and fly through holes in time, space and the plot. Somewhere in there, they pick up an orange, bulging eyed, hideous space freak they call the &quot;Blawrp.&quot; It's a CGI-rendered monstrosity even less convincing than the Bloop from the original show (played by a chimp in a fur helmet with ears).<br /><BR>To point out just one of the many problems with this film- there's no plot justification for having a Blawrp or a Bloop. He joins the story and contributes zilch. But that didn't stop the actors, so why should it stop a special effects monkey? The Blawrp is supposed to be oh-so-cute, and everyone in the cast gives him those awed-and-in-love faces, when they really should toss him out the airlock.<BR><BR>Which is where this movie should go. It's noisy, annoying and makes little, if any, sense. The script is self-consciously cutesy, and the pat character bits and dysfunctional family motif wear out their welcome after about the fifth time Dr. Robinson disappoints little Will, or the third argument between... oh who cares anymore?
B00000AOTZ|4.0|There should have been some old school hip-hop song on the soundtrack.  Maybe like Grandmaster Flash or Grand Wizard Theodore or Kool Moe Dee.  Anything to accentuate New York ghetto life at the time.  If that would have happened,  hip hop might have come up a little earlier and got some exposure instead of having to wait for Run-D.M.C. to save it 4 years later in 1983 when this movie came out in '79, 'cause I remember watching it on the ABC prime time Sunday night movie in '83.
B0000060NF|5.0|Words make no justice to this album at all...the best thing you can do if you havent listened to this album yet,is getting it right here and hear it...A person who says who likes music and doesnt have this album,is a liar...Strong,but true... The emotion and love that lies within is hard to explain...Simply think that here are together the best male singer in history (obviously,this is my opinion) and some of the most gorgeous and wonderful songs ever written...Listen to &quot;Whats Going On&quot; (the song),&quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot;,&quot;Save The Children&quot; or &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)&quot; and tell me if youve listened to better songs than these...Personally I think thats impossible... Buy this CD and youll see the light!...
0385484518|4.0|I went looking this summer for books that would make a difference in my life.  Tuesdays With Morrie is a good read, and I enjoyed it.  It was not the deep life-changing experience I was looking for, however.  I liked it, wouldn't discourage anyone from buying it, but it seemed like just a book.  ...
B00004YX39|4.0|When I was still a buck, yet music had already lost enough innocence to spawn the abominable &quot;The Rolling Stone Guide to Rock And Roll,&quot; trees fell in vain over this album. The critical consensus was one star, with a call or two for the gas chamber.  <br />Man, how time has evened up the score! Although I like 'em, I'm not the biggest Steely Fan, which makes me all the more confident saying this is one of the most unfairly maligned albums I've ever heard. <br />Genius?  Naaah. Still, our hindsight (and their foresight) flings &quot;Gaucho&quot; as closely to its sweet edge as our boys ever got, conceptually and lyrically speaking. <br />Already famous for their powers of subversion (&quot;Rikki Don't Lose That Number&quot;; &quot;I Got the News&quot;) and inscrutability (that damn &quot;Josie&quot; refrain!) D/W pulled off a more meaningful ruse with &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot; and &quot;Hey Nineteen.&quot;  <br />Ever feel the strikingly different impact of &quot;19&quot; on and off the album? As a Top-40 hit, &quot;19&quot; was a trifle whose obvious lesson exhausted most of its meaning and all of its welcome after a few spins. That's why this record became the soundtrack to your next root canal.<br />But when heard after &quot;Babylon Sisters,&quot; the same recording is a jarring, real-time rumination on lechery and loneliness. It sets an ambitious agenda of introspection and denial that is fulfilled by the rest of the album (with more than the usual attention to drugs and the charms of ahem, young boys and young girls). <br />Suddenly, those deceptively Prozack-y riffs and under-key vocal arrangements (which sound surprisingly rich on the remaster) drip with irony. <br />OF COURSE it's easy listening, these guys are GETTING OLD...GET IT? Either critics didn't, or didn't want to.<br />In fact, after listening to this album again, it seems these boys were being extremely hard on themselves, and by proxy, critics who were also past prime. The 70's were over; so was the fun -now what?  <br />The finality of it all rankled on levels many seemed unwilling to acknowledge, let alone accept. As tales of this project's excess and calamity got out - and especially after Donald Fagen released the crtically-praised &quot;The Nightfly&quot; two years later -it seemed Steely Dan was history, and that &quot;Gaucho&quot; was, atop its other sins, an ungracious middle finger of a breakup album. <br />Not quite - but it would take years for that to become clear.<br />Meanwhile, the White Male Oracles of Rock had game to hunt.  They had finally slain Disco. They didn't dare discuss the self-destruction of punk (hard-wired and already well underway), for they had long championed that genre's traditional values of rock n' roll rebellion.<br />There really wasn't a lot to go after. But Steely Dan presented a juicy morsel.  After all, they had reveled in disco's hedonism, albeit with two left feet (interestingly, several theoretically undanceable Steely Dan hits remain standards on the gay disco circuit). Face it: these dudes had leered for years at topics most critics didn't even want to think about yet, and were making mad money doing it.  But this time, the fix was in...and Steely Dan apparently knew it before the first copy sold:<br />&quot;Turn that Jungle Music Down/Just Until We Get Out of Town,&quot; indeed.<br />But you know what? <br />I'm 38 years old now, and offended not one bit, now that I'm the one talking to the 19 year-olds.*  <br />They were absolutely right! So I think I'll crank it up on the way home tonight!<br />*metaphorically speaking, heh, heh...
B000002C1W|1.0|I really didn't like this album cause it just isn't the Pink Floyd I'm use to hearing.  You can just tell it's from the 80s, they kinda lose their destinctive sound that is in such albums like Dark Side of the Moon.  I would not recommend this album, but I guess if you like their later stuff, get it cause you'll probably like it.
B00004Z459|3.0|There are a few good songz on here and it got plenty of play from me at first, but after awhile they sort of just turned into another MTV band... and thatz a shame considering some of the talent they have. Saw them at Ozzfest and they were pretty intense, didn't even play crawling (which is a good thing since i can't go anywhere without hearing it). I fear that in the end they're gonna be another limp bizkit or korn rehash. if you like most of todayz nu-metal, this could be your cup of tea, but don't look for anything really original here.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is one of Pink Floyds best albums.  \\"Speak to me/Breathe\\" has to be the most laid back song I have ever heard, and it definetly sets the pace for the rest of the cd (with an exception to Money).  Money has a 70's rock-n-roll feeling to it, and odds are most people know the song but just don't know what the name of it is.  This cd is great to sit back, turn on the Lava Lamps, and just listen.  \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" along with \\"Wish You Were Here\\" are my favorite albums, both very similiar in some ways.  So if you want laid back, smooth soundin Floyd, get this album......
B00004R9A4|5.0|From the men who brought you &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. From some of the same men who were also involved in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;. From the director who brought you &quot;The Absent Minded Professor&quot;, &quot;The Love Bug&quot; and several others. Comes the story of a trio of orphns, a huckster of hucksters, and an apprentice witch. It's &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; and it's one of the most treasured DVDs in my collection. Join Eglantine Price and Professor Emelius Brown as they search for the spell that causes substitutiary locomotion, and may very well help in the war effort. Come along on a romp through Portibello Road and a journey to the Island of Naboomboo. You'll enjoy every minute of this. This DVD contains 19 minutes of restored footage that was cut from the original release. There is also a 20 minute suppliment featuring interviews with Angela Lansbury, the Sherman BRothers, and many others who were involved in creating thismarvelous film. You MUST own this disc, it is one of the FINEST ever made. It's too bad that &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; wasn't given this treatment when it came to DVD. Buy this now, you won't regret it.
B00004TRD8|4.0|This sequel to the original has an excellent continued plot. The acting is superb and the movie has continual action. It constantly keeps one on the edge of their seat! The only part of the script that leaves something else to be desired is the scene where Linda Hamilton goes into her own speech or tirade against the scientists and the destruction they have created vs the creation of a child by birth. On the whole - a great scifi film!
0525945636|4.0|I read this book in one day while on vacation. As always, Ken Follett did his research and created compelling characters in a non-stop action situation. Although this was not my favorite book by him, this book was excellent. If you want an edge of your seat, fast paced novel that has a little bit of everything from crime, to romance, history and suspense, you have your book. If only he wrote faster.
B000001ED1|5.0|Joan Osborne is one of those artists who asks the question 'Who is God?' and points at you and me with the answer in &quot;One Of Us&quot; which is track no. 6 on her second album, titled &quot;Relish&quot;. While this track is probably the most widely known, every single track on this album is a masterpiece. (The same goes for her third album, &quot;Righteous Love&quot; which I personally like - what 'like'... _adore_ - even more! Both are absolutely worth having in your CD-collection. Joan's music is emotional, her voice is strong, sexy and beautiful, the lyrics depicts intelligence and after having listened to her songs, you sure have received something valuable. A quote from Joan Osborne: &quot;I haven't really thought about trying to do something that's current or hip right now. There's an Oscar Wilde quote: 'Beware of being too fashionable, or you'll soon be unfashionable'. I try to dig at the roots of the things that I'm drawn to, because those things, to me, are timeless. And if I take my inspiration from that, there's a greater chance the music I make will also be timeless.&quot;
0452282152|4.0|This is a good, light book that teaches a good deal about the time period in which it takes place. My only complaint is that I did not grow to feel compassion towards any of the characters. They all seem shallow. However, I found myself turning the pages of this book, compelled to read it to the end. When I put it down I was left satisfied, even if it was not as deep as I'd have liked.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|We all remember our first love.  Bittersweet memories that bless and burn as we recall the wonder, the thrill, the urgency. The evocative tone of &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; brings it all back.  Has there ever been a more brilliant use of a rock and roll song in a movie than the use of this song as the lovers talk at the jukebox in &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;?
0688170528|5.0|Jodi Picoult is fantastic, and one of my favorite writers of all time. Whenever her books come out I rush to buy them and am always disappointed when I reach the last, always gripping, pages. This book left me with so many unanswered questions, but not in a disatisfied way. It left me wondering why people do the things they do sometimes, and it left me wanting to crawl inside the character's minds and understand why and how, and what would have happened if things were different. What a great read.
0380730367|5.0|Once again Dennis Lehane has wrote a beauty of a story. I couldn't put it down after page 2. Wonderful twists and turns with great characters. He keeps the suspence going and going. A great read. I hope he writes more Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro tales.......soon. This is the 5th and last in the series.
0385484518|5.0|This book should be required reading for life. Morrie has lessons to teach that everyone needs to hear. He is such a wonderful, loveable man, and the world is lucky to have all that which is shared in this book as a reference on living. I buy this book as a gift again and again, and refer to it often. It is truly beautiful.
1573226521|5.0|This is a great book.  It is any easy read and makes you wonder about your own mind and morals.
6305807043|3.0|\\"Being John Malkovich\\" is like being tossed in an enigmatic New York City with John Cusack with a bad hair day and Cameron Diaz with a really bad hair day. Add a comedic/fantasy twist, faithful Malkovich and Catherine Keener, and you have an anemic, enigmatic comedy that has no doubt whether it be dry/wet wit, but is lacking heart. Well, it WAS nominated for 3 Academy Awards.<br />It begins with a lackluster puppeteer (Cusack) who accepts a job as an exceptionally fast filing clerk, and he falls for the sharp, cool debutante Maxine (appropriately Catherine Keener) who rejects him. Later, he finds a portal that takes him into the mind and brain of John Malkovich for 15 minutes, and he coerces Maxine into making the portal in a entrepreneur business, and unpredictability occurs (but I won't give it away).<br />This dark comedy has a sort of dramatic effect, and the ending is quite unbelievable. To me, I see little comedy and it goes in my book as a \\"not bad\\" movie. But, the utter brilliance and the sharp, witty performance by Maxine makes it a movie to watch two times and forget about it.<br />But, the movie should have won a Razzie for worse costuming of the year. Look at Cusack and Diaz's hair in the movie! I think it would be better if Diaz and Keener switched roles, but it's a fine comedy for a rainy day, though \\"Shrek\\" is far better than this profane comedy/fantasy.<br />Rated R for language, violence, and for mild nudity.
B000002AQQ|5.0|Disc 1: Kick's off with a swing/rock&amp;roll-classic; Hound Dog, where you hear Elvis, just takin his soul, to sing about that mean ol' hound dog, and with that, you just wanna take your grandmother up on from her chair, and take a good ol' swing with her! From that, there's a great collection of classic 60's songs; to shake your booty to (Land Of 1000 Dances), to a romantic-sing-along (I don't know why i love you [but i do]), to a live-aucustic-masterpiece (Blowin in the wind), to a excellent man-rock-anthem (Fortunate Son) [remember 'Nam?], to a absolut classic soul-sister-single (Respect), [where Aretha's just cryin out load for som respect on her!], to a sugar-sweet-girlfreind-love-song (Sugar pie [honey bunch]), to just stand-alone-classic-songs, as California Dreamin' [if you listen to the song with only one speaker on, in the begining, you can hear Barry McGuire sing!], Mrs. Robinson, and Break on through, (to the other side) [rock on Jim!] Disc 2:  Rock&amp;Roll kicks dics two off, the get your attention, with Jefferson Airplane, with one of the best female rock singers of the 60's! Sex, Drugs and Rock&amp;Roll (San Fransisco) [woodstock], Rock-Boyband-single (Turn! Turn!...), classic medley (Aquarius), aucustic again with Nilsson (Everbody's talkin'), play-it-loud-and-sing-along-please (Joy To The World), Soul-sister-love with Diana &amp; co. (Stoned Love), a great &quot;singin i the rain&quot;-competetor [and a personal favourite #1] (Raindrops keep falling on my head), great-drive-song [personal favourite #2] (On The Road Again), cryin-out-loud [again](Mr. President), boogie-country-rock&amp;roll, simply rockabilly and a classic song (Sweet Home Alabama), and at last, to end it off, lovely &amp; magnificent at the same time, the Forrest Gump Suite. Disc 2 has got the same flavours as the first one, but the soundtrack wouldn't be complete without it. This is a great collection, that reaches the years and the places in the movie. Simply, a classic collection of songs, to a all-time-great-oscar-winning-movie; Forrest Gump.
B00003CXXI|4.0|&quot;Shrek&quot; is an absolutely funny movie, that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, though some of the jokes are about flatuence and somewhat, but inwardly rude. But, the movie is very, VERY funny, poking fun at Disney and the head bigwig Michael Eisner by making the villain into a pint-size, democratic ruler, Lord Farquarad (voiced by John Lithgow).<br />A big, but impossible not to like, green ogre, appopriately named &quot;Shrek&quot; (voiced by Mike Myers) finds out that that the whole bunch of the fairy tale creatures, including a wisecracking donkey, called &quot;Donkey&quot; (voice by Eddie Murphy), have moved into his private area. This results in very quotable quotes. (&quot;Oh no. Dead broad OFF the table!&quot;)<br />Furious, Shrek goes to Lord Farquarad to get rid of the unwanted pests. Farquarad eagerly makes a bargain: rescue Princess Fiona from a dragon and he'll move them off Shrek's land. Shrek happily goes off to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), accompanied by Donkey, resulting in hilarious results.<br />This movie, while mostly a comedy, has a heart. After being rescued, Princess Fiona has a dark secret; when night falls, she turns into an ogre. When the sun comes up, she changes back into her normal self.<br />This movie teaches a moral: Never judge a person by their appearance. While kids may not care for the lesson implied for it, they'll enjoy the upbeat ending and it's hilarious &quot;cast.&quot;<br />&quot;Shrek&quot; is enjoyable, though some of the material may not be appropriate for little kids. It's an enjoyable, funny movie, while teaching a valuable lesson and it has a heart. Roger Ebert gave it **** stars. I eagerly agree.<br />Rated PG for language, sexual innueudo, and for some crude humor.
0553573403|3.0|George R.R. Martin has been feted as Tolkien's successor in TIME Magazine and in newspapers, heralded by his fans as being better than Robert Jordan, and all the accolades inspired a jaundiced attitude in me as I read \\"A Game Of Thrones.\\"  I will say this:  it's nowhere as bad as anything by Jordan or David Eddings, both of whom write on a 7th-grade level with flat characters.  I couldn't finish either of the novels I started that were written by the forenamed authors.  But I finished \\"A Game Of Thrones\\" and look forward to the rest of Martin's series.<br />Why, because the man's press is true?  Well, no, it isn't.  Martin is better than Jordan and Eddings, but that's like comparing the junior high valedictorian to the rest of his class.  His writing is brisk, gets the story moving, flows well; it's also pedestrian, and I doubt there are any phrases that'll stick to mind when I'm finished with his series.  He doesn't seem to have much love or regard for language.<br />So is he Tolkien's heir in spite of this?  No, because, in spite of the fact that Tolkien's language is antique and often overdone, Tolkien was a master at worldbuilding.  Most Tolkien fans would love to find Middle-earth.  I wouldn't pay two cents for a stay in the Seven Kingdoms if I had dragons for bodyguards; it's a cold, unpleasant place.  But Martin brings it to life, which makes him a superior storyteller to Eddings, Jordan and company.<br />Did I like the story?  Yes, in spite of the fact that it's a retelling of the Wars of the Roses.  I rather suspect I know who'll win in the end.  I've gotten attached to certain characters-Jon, Bran, Arya, Tyrion, Daenerys, Sandor Clegane and, oddly, Loras Tyrell-and hate others (Cersei, Catelyn, Sansa, Gregor Clegane, Janos Slynt, almost anybody named Lannister or connected to them, Alliser Thorne).  The language is blunt; so are the situations.  I'm grateful.  Enough fantasy is whitewashed and Disneyized; thank goodness Martin shows a medieval world so real you can smell the mud and garbage as well as the flowers and spices.<br />\\"Song of Ice And Fire\\" is not a masterwork, but it's a good read.  And it looks as if it will have a real conclusion.  I'll stick with it until I find something better or it ends.l you can smell the mud and garbage as well as the flowers and spices.<br />\\"Song of Ice And Fire\\" is not a masterwork, but it's a good read.

6304416415|5.0|The story is about an inventor Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) who is trying to perfect his machine which, when working, will shrink matter. The problem is, nothing he does seems to make it work. But somehow, his kids Amy and Nicky (Amy O'Neill and Robert Oliveri), and his next door neighbor's kids, Russell and Ron Thompson (Thomas Wilson Brown and Jared Rushton) are shrunk! Being only a few inches tall, they end up in the garbage bag and are taken outside. They get out but the only way back to the house is through the Szalinski's front yard. They meet up with a friendly ant, a killer scorpion, the danger of being chopped up by a lawnmower, and being drowned by a water sprinkler. Will they make it home so they can be made back to their normal size?<br />This movie is just GREAT! Even though it's a kids movie, it's great for adults, too. I love to watch this movie with my parents. I especially love Robert Oliveri and Jared Rushton. They did a very good job acting in it. Anybody who wants to enjoy a good movie with the family, watch &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.&quot; You won't regret it!
B00003CXB2|5.0|As repetitive as it may sound, this is definitely one of the masterworks of cinema.  Fantastically shot and superbly acted, I absolutely had to purchase the DVD when it was released.  Knowing that the film had been restored by Robert A. Harris, I figured I was in for a treat.  I was right.  The transfer is pristine.  The only thing I noticed were the light vertical bands in some of the desert scenes, caused by heat damage to the camera rolls during filming, not to any DVD transfer problem.  The only other minor blemish was in the tent scene with Feisal--the brightness level pulses up and down at a regular interval, again likely due to uneven weathering of the original print.  <br />These complaints, however, are trivial when viewed in respect to the film as a whole. The cinematography is nothing short of stunning (I absolutely love the well sequence when we first see &quot;Fred&quot; Sharif) and the DVD captures it perfectly.  The soundtrack is also magnificently presented in 5.1 channel Dolby Digital.  Ignore the &quot;Widescreen Review&quot; information provided by Amazon...it seems to be for the wrong film.<br />You won't go wrong with this DVD.
B00004TJJZ|5.0|&quot;Men in Black&quot;. When you first look at the cover of it and even hear the title, you would think that it would be a very scary and very violent movie. Well, anyway, that's what I thought. Until I finally watched it. And to tell you the truth, it wasn't as bad as I thought at all! Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great as 'the men in black', agents who watch over the population of aliens on the planet earth. This is a very funny movie with lots of great action scenes, too. Language might be a bit strong for younger kids but I'm sure teenagers and adults will love this movie as much as I did!

B00005BL2A|5.0|Pretty unusual feeling about this album. Each track seems close to precedents but finally they're are really brand new with a sound I've never heard from them. The emotionality which was &quot;on the surface&quot; now seems hidden you every listener can found it in him/herself rather than in the music.  Great album. I' am eager to see them playing a gig.
B00003CXRP|3.0|CAST AWAY is a little slow starting, a great movie once they get Tom Hanks onto the island and then peters out at the end. In the beginning, it's a little tough to buy Hanks as an driven, time-obsessed, Type-A personality businessman, but he comes across well as a modern Everyman surviving on a desert island. There is a good deal of humor and a number of &quot;Cool Idea!&quot; moments. The ending deals with his return to civilization. Kudos for trying to show this readjustment, but the attempt to show CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is heavy-handed and his situation on returning strikes me as unrealistic: Where are his friends and family? <br />A good try, but a bit overambitious. There is a lot to be learned from a plain &quot;stranded on a desert island&quot; movie; no point is weighing it down with too much setup and conclusion.

I did enjoy some of the images Forster paints, as in the scene in the mosque where  Miss Quested and Mrs. Moore first meet Aziz, and some moments of light humor, such as the scene where Aziz lends Fielding his shirt pin (or whatever it was) and Ronny later uses this against him and his culture.<br />However, I just can't recommend it. I really tried to like it. Perhaps I've played too many video games, but it was just extremely plodding, and the dialogue was not interesting enough to justify its length. It's a shame because it's books like this that make me shy away from reading more &quot;classic&quot; literature, some of which I really love, but some disappoints me as Passage did. The good news is I tend to stay up a lot later that I should and this helped me get to sleep early on numerous occasions.
0345308239|4.0|I enjoyed this book in audiobook format, read by  Grover Gardner, a regular voice talent in audiobooks.<br />I have enjoyed Tuchman's other works before (Proud Tower, Practicing History, and the magnum opus, The Guns of August)<br />This work was good; True , not on par with _Guns_ or P.T. but nobody hits home-runs ALL the time.<br />It was stimulating history writing, often amusing. I don't always agree with Tuchman's views, and her less than charitable words for the Vietnam era American &quot;New Left&quot; were most puzzling, given her criticism of government policy on Vietnam.<br />But I can still recommend the book.

B00004U30D|4.0|You've read all the rave reviews and they are all justified-but there were a few things that bothered me about American beauty. People often characterize Lester Burnham, the protaganist, as Everyman. However, the Burnham family is far wealthier than the average family in reality.  In addition, giving the family a generic name like Burnham and neglecting to show a single non-white face shows complete ignorance of what America is actually like.  I mean, take away the pot smoking and fornication and it could be a Leave it to Beaver remake. I did think that American Beauty was a provacative, daring film and I loved it, but I also think that the makers are trying to appeal to no one so much as  the self-styled Lester Burnhams in the audience; middle-aged, upper middle class white men who sold their souls for their careers and now want to have their cake and eat it too.  Ricky Fitts, the sensitive drug dealer, is a brilliant character and it's hard not to swoon over him but when push comes to shove, his pursuit of Jane sends the message that when girls say &quot;Leave me alone&quot;, they mean &quot;videotape me stripping for you&quot;. Angela is another inspired character who seems full of suprises but is basically the personification of the stereotypical self-centered tease who's all talk.  The one thing I cannot find fault with is the performances, with the possibility of Peter Gallagher whose tremendous eyebrows distract the viewer a bit. All in all, American Beauty is a thought-provoking movie that everyone should see, but think before you decide what you believe and who you admire.
B00000IPAX|5.0|When i first listened to this cd i loved it. Almost every song on here is great! and i highly disagree with anyone that says this album is not punk, with songs like &quot;Dysentary Gary, Party Song, Dumpweed, Going away to college&quot; all great tracks!! and definetly worth buying. This cd was my first 1 by them, and i when i first bought it I couldnt stop listening to it and i still love it a lot! If u are debating whether to buy it or not i suggest you do cause it, it really is a great album, for a blink fan or not. Definetly worth it!

0743216385|4.0|.... Historian Steven Ambrose's 'Band of Brothers' (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster) chronicles the real-life military exploits of the crack paratrooper infantry unit Easy Company, one of the most admired battalions during World War II. Mixing popular military psychology with journals, letters and extensive interviews with members of the unit, the well-written book is a fascinating glimpse at the psyche of the Easy Company soldiers, against a backdrop of some of the most important battles waged in that war. <clip> Interestingly, Ambrose's focus on the existentialist aspect of war rather than the obvious carnage that occurs reminds me most of the fiction trilogy of 'From Here to Eternity,' 'The Thin Red Line' and the under-rated 'Whistle,' written by James Jones. The methodology of extensive interviews with the members of the unit and the writings and journals of others, meanwhile, is more akin to the works of Mark Bowden (the similarly stunning war novel 'Black Hawk Down,' which itself has been translated into a piece of filmmaking, set for next March). Overall, I have found this to be among the most fascinating pieces of literature I've read this year, fiction or non-fiction. ...
