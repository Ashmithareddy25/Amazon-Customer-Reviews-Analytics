B00LG0F1AW|5|Nice helmet
B00BXQ00Z0|5|On time delivery and mout fit perfectly
B00RW4LM18|5|I was so skeptical about this product after reading the reviews and everybody talking about the cheap quality and how bad these hub caps fitted.<br />When I received them I sort of understood where people were coming from with their comments about the &#34;plastic & cheap quality&#34;... but at the same time... you can't expect metal covers and pay $30.00 for a 4 pack!<br />They really didn't look as bad to me! They're actually more shiny than the picture and a little darker in color.<br />They were easy to put and compared to other buyers mines never broke nor were damaged in the installation process. The original hub caps that came with my car were really worn out and didn't look good anymore. These caps gave my car a new look and I'm happy with them.<br />The bolts you see in the picture are just an appearance, you do not need a lug wrench to install them. I'm a woman and it was as easy as pie for me to install them!<br />Remember... they are not made to fit your tire/rim particularly, and eventually the roundness of your rim will depend on how long you've been driving your car -not to mention the &#34;bumps in the road&#34;-, therefore, they're not going to be perfectly set! But I've tried and they don't come off easily plus they set good enough to look great to the naked eye!
B00P2SYBJG|5|Very satisfied.
B00AM3I3FO|5|it fit my 1999 Tacoma 2wd no problems
B003SNTDMW|5|Fits and works perfectly.
B00802FT6U|5|good
B000MWLKSM|5|simple to install, look great
B000MN4KQ0|5|Perfect
B00G76M5AY|3|one center had scratches on it-
B00K72C1T4|1|works great would buy a few more they work good for storing batteries   update drained my battery what a pos ruined my battery in my bike buy a different brand used twice
B000BZEFGY|1|The Amazon website matched this product to my car.  It was the incorrect part for a Mercedes.  This is a VW part and will not go onto my car causing me to loose money.
B004BE7VUI|5|Works perfectly - what more can I say!?!  I have 2 vehicles and use the tester often.  Especially helpful if a trailer light (or lights) is not working, you can quickly rule out the vehicle wiring as the cause.  Inexpensive way of tracking down a problem with your lights and not involving a mechanic!  You don't need any mechanical background to use, simply plug it in!
B007HRI6U0|5|My cat chews small cords (like they are mouse tails). Not any more! A loom spiting tool is very helpful.
B00429NKWK|5|I used this on my 2003 BMW 325i. The headlights were so yellowed I failed the Maryland safety inspection. All the reviews are true to form. Yes, it's a fair amount of work, but the result is really worth it.
B002BHWZFI|5|Wow I'm blown away at how fast I revived this. It works great, I work in delivery and I go in and out of houses all day. I love my glasses not fogging up.
B00NRVDJMK|5|Good fit. These lights are very bright and look really good on my 2007 tundra. I will be ordering the fog lights and low beams as well. Great value fast shipping and seem to be a solid product.
B005CHT4W6|5|Nice product except you have to join Prime<br />Wal-Mart has it for the same price.
B00GD2BZL2|5|Good deal thank you
B00O5E7N4I|5|As it wAs listed
B000JWI65A|2|didnt fit even though it said it would.
B004BSCVAO|3|Not sure if it actually works or not. I have to retro fit my '92 Civic. I used regular R134a from a different brand it was cold then went warm. I decided to then try this and to replace the AC filter. It turned cold again but I'm not sure if it made the air colder.
B00NN4XTXK|5|They work great
B00CZBQCR2|5|I love these things, bought these to replace the old ones that I had that were more than 20 years old. After replacing the front ones I had to buy more to install in the rear and the trunk.
B00JLJI648|5|Installed easily while doing an oil change, and oil pressure gauge being pegged at maximum issue fixed.
B002IV4KFA|1|This was used on my husbands small commercial boat and used for fog- not raging seas. It broke 40 days after purchase which was after approximately 12 days of actual use. Again. For fog. Not birds or even bugs. Fog.
B000COSAMY|5|Great shocks for cheap ! Dad put these in for me and it took him about an hour. Glad I didn't have to pay a mechanic for the parts and labor. They seem to be working good.
B00CAKILAO|5|Fit my '15 4Runner with just one trim along the top lines.  It does arrive with an odor, but letting it air out for a couple weeks makes it better.  The mat has kept liquids from getting to the rug, so I'm happy and satisfied with the performance.  The mat is reasonably thick and does not look 'cheap'.
B000TCAY96|5|good
B001H1GQ7M|5|Bought them during Sandy..Just in case..
B00L6VCP7I|1|I didn't get the harness that plugs into the factory  plug to my truck so I can't put them in help help help help help!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DN7GI58|1|Almost impossible to put on. One part would not even stick.
B00OVW09N6|5|Work well and provide nice quality lighting inside.
B000X9EGFS|5|I love this compressor. It was a little bigger than I expected, but it is great quality and works well. I spent months deciding which compressor to get, and I finally decided to go with this one.  It may not be the fastest compressor on the market, but the 100% duty cycle was the biggest selling point for me. The second selling point was the longevity of the compressor. I am in a Jeep club, and this is a favorite among the members. Many of them have had it for years and it is still running strong.<br /><br />I use this almost exclusively for offroading. I air my Jeep tires down to 12-15 psi. It takes about 10-12 minutes to air all 4 tires back up to 30 psi (that includes checking the pressure, going between tires, etc.). I have 31 x 10.50 tires. As I said above, it isn't a FAST compressor, but it isn't slow either.<br /><br />A benefit that I wasn't expecting was the noise level. It isn't as loud as the cheap-o 120 V compressor I used in the past that was slower than this one. I feel like my engine in the Jeep runs louder than the compressor.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised by the accuracy of the built-in pressure gauge. Mine is within 1 psi of my other gauges. You do have to release the trigger and stop airing up the tires to check the pressure. It cannot accurately measure the pressure while airing up. Luckily, I noticed that the pressure gauge is about 3-5 psi higher while I'm actively airing up the tire than the actual tire pressure, which means I can air up until about 5 psi higher than my target and I'm usually really close. It makes me wonder if the other reviews mentioning that their gauge was off by 5 psi was because they were reading it while airing the tire up.<br /><br />The carrying case is nice, but a hard case would have been more appreciated. That isn't a big deal because I'm not rating the case.<br /><br />I feel that overall this was a great purchase!
B00JLOS77E|4|Replaced a rusted out regulator in my 04' bug with this part. Fit perfectly. Wish I could have found an easy replacement for the harness that plugs into this part, but that is a different issue. Overall, worked great and did what it was supposed to.
B00GCU281G|5|This shade works perfect for my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. Great quality.
B000CIJ308|5|great product...shine lasts awhile even after rain
B0031ZDU62|5|Don't be fooled by the low price.  These ignition coils work as good as coils costing ten times the price.
B005U30O76|5|Excellent
B00AFVT5OQ|1|Warning: this does not fit a 2003 760Li. I purchased it and did not change my oil for a while and now cannot return it, waste of $18. Don't rely on recommendations being correct.
B002UC6WT4|5|Product was as described. Fits well and works great.
B00P9AB4OC|5|Exellent..
B002M7ZSHY|4|It's decent pads and very quiet. came with hardware which doesn't fit right and didn't come with brake grease or clamp for rear brakes which i had to buy extra. There was no sensor included as for front pads. Ok but lack some information about pads if you visit Raybestos website
B004LN52EQ|5|Love it
B00ITEZH5C|5|Perfect!
B0095RBYW2|4|These appear to be well made, solid chrome plating, and most importantly, they fit!*  I had a previous set of Genuine Toyota locking lug nuts that did not have the washer on them.  For reference, the stock Toyota lug nuts do have a washer on them, so you get dual contact on the rims where the washer contacts and where the tapered lug nut end contacts.  My local tire shop told me that the old locks were the wrong kind due to no washers, and to replace them.  I just bolted them on tonight and they tightened up just fine.  *they fit on my 2008 Toyota Tundra TRD with 20 inch factory aluminum wheels.  I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because I have no data on how they will hold up to wear and tear and consequently, will not rust!
B000BOA9RY|5|If any of you like me, and might have a Type-A Personality then I can assure you this will not work unless you read the instructions. Who reads instructions???  Anyway, I didn't read the manufacturer's instructions on the rear of package and the needle registered all the way to the top.  I figured, that just meant it was really concentrated so I said OK. I'm done.  Then I was going to leave a review here and state that my unit worked just fine, until I read some other reviews that it should not be reading all the way to the top outside of the markings.  So, the next day (today) I went back outside and while my coolant was cool (yesterday it was still hot when i read it), then I read it again and made sure the bubbles were gone and guess what???? It registered within the markings.  So, if you don't like to read instructions and may think you know everything, spare yourself and just read the instructions and do it right the first time :D
B003TNHEO0|5|Very good product.
B002W2A0MW|5|would buy again.
B004YWSV3I|5|great works good
B004BTEYEO|1|Despite what Amazon says This is not for an 84 Mustang Gt With a 5.0 and manual Trans. It does bolt up to the crank and the ring gear is correct however the bolt pattern for the clutch is a mile off, also it appears to be slightly thicker
B008HZGXAQ|5|when you need this stuff you need it.
B0002UEPVI|2|This stuff may be good for commercial jobs but for little home repairs it's junk. The tube is huge and the screw on applicator tip has no cover so using it more than once is completely impossible. In other words, it does a good job of sealing itself.
B00VS2BV4I|5|Great quality decal with precise cut. I'll definitely do business again!
B0052FRP74|4|Worked as described. Slightly concerned about long term durability
B00SYFZ5QC|3|priming was difficult but once started worked well
B007Q2YRE0|5|I've been using this for about two weeks. I had returned an Energizer 4000 watt that was having trouble. This inverter is proving to be well worth the money. I have ran the washing machine, side by side fridge, 1100 watt microwave, Oster's largest oven, 5 gal. shop vac, drip coffee pot, large screen TV and entertainment center, sodium vapor security lights, ceiling fans with CF bulbs, hair dryer, windows AC unit, and my 220v 1hp sta-rite well pump (converted to 110v). As much as it will run, it won't power my Kuerig coffee pot. The pot won't even turn on with the inverter. I have one 4' florescent that lights dimly with it and one sodium vapor light that won't come on with it. Thats to be expected since there are some things that won't work right with a modified sine wave inverter. My computer is connected to a pure sine wave UPS so the UPS does not like the inverter. I have ran several things at once and my fridge pretty much stays on it as well as one security light and overhead fans. Update: 08-22-2015 Tech support gave me a few suggestions to try concerning the coffee pot not working. That didn't work and they could not explain why it wouldn't work. Since the overhead fans whine and some lights won't work, I've decided to go with the AIMS pure sine wave. After all being said, this inverter is a very good one if you don't mind modified sine wave.
B00CR7SLNM|5|Great!!
B006FW3G2G|5|Works great, I use this to charge an 18AH battery as a mini-battery backup system (for charging portable devices and to power emergency lighting).  This panel meets my needs and I'm pleased with the performance.
B00F09D9YA|5|Great product! Very heavy duty. I was worried it would be cheaply made. I put it on a 2002 ford Mustang and fit perfectly. Shipped and delivered in a timely manner.
B0002SRG4S|4|thanks
B003W2MQDM|5|These work soo well really made a difference on the road and also when turning corners at a high speed my car was at 4&#34; now its at 5 1/2  witch is cool
B00D8IQE4C|4|good quality, but didn't fit my 2015 Colorado
B000GV6WFA|5|I like the fact that its American made and have no doubt it will work fine when snow comes...great price too.
B00BSG3AIE|3|One of these in my bathroom of my 5th wheel burned out while connected to shore power within 5 min of use :(
B00EW01BCU|5|Works great
B00T6JNY72|5|fast shipped went on with no problem - exactly as described
B00N7KNI1S|4|Love these but not a perfect fit on my 2015 jeep....we made it work, but not a custom fit.  I still like them enough to make it work!
B00FNJ2QGY|5|Just as I expected.......cute!
B00CPGGZNS|1|Thes are a cheap knock off i bought 2 of these. So i called fedral signal they said if the pattern button is not flush with the light it is made in china. If u buy and they flash button light sticks out like this light does do not buy. The real fedral signal cost 205 dollars. I turn the power on and it flashes once then shuts off. When i hit flash pattern it turns on and does not keep the flash pattern you want.
B00T5NKDSC|5|This is a great emergency kit.<br /><br />The flashlight is very powerful, and the amount of charges it has for the size is great. It's very easy to use, it's gotten me out of many binds.<br />It's lightweight for all the functions it has. It's also essential for road trips, especially if you like your technology. It recharges my phone and daughters laptop effortlessly.<br /><br />I'd recommend it!
B001TJXWH4|5|I was a little skeptical at first about buying a detergent at 3 times the normal price. OK, I bit and since I have so many microfiber towels that I thought I'd give it a try. Amazed is not the word!!!!! I've included the before and after pics as proof. Great product and I will be buying more as time goes on. Thanks Chemical Guys......great product!
B003SYT5WY|5|Just like OEM.
B005ZVETZG|3|I wish that the actual net part would extend from one end of the trunk to the other to allow for more holding space, but I do really like that I can put a few things in there to keep them from sliding all over the place in my trunk.  It fit perfectly in my 2013 Toyota Camry.
B00H1I639Q|5|Look great and perform well. Appear to be well made 1 piece product. These are smaller then the origianl ones on my F150 and thought that might be a problem. So far no issues. Look great and not a spot of rust so far.
B010UA5UHW|5|Excellent products I love them, never had any problems with them. RESPECT!!
B000JFHNG0|5|Not much to say. It's a quality set and does the job. Even has instructions on how to evacuate and recharge.
B0066S2UCG|5|It fits well for my car.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Fast delivery and great product....very happy.
B00CEKG6Y8|5|Fits perfect. Recommended.
B00KLKJB9U|4|This carburetor does not fit my 2003 Honda XR100R. I repeat, it does not fit the bike. Both the air intake and the manifold(?) side do not match as the carburetor is too big. It seems as if it would fit a XR200R perfectly though. But it will not fit your 2003 Honda XR100R.<br />I gave it a four star rating because the carb itself is pretty nice, the free throttle cable addition is awesome. It just doesn't fit my motorcycle. Returning it was easy and the seller was understanding.
B00EARCXXG|4|Push pin pliers<br />Decent quality<br />Decent price
B005GRGOGG|5|This distributor is a great price. I had a msd and it would have cost me triple the price of this one.I have a 396 pushing close to 420 hp.,it runs great with this product.I would buy it again.
B000E7WLJW|5|well worth the money...
B004I0W4LG|5|nice aftermarket product. Fit perfectly and looks great
B00EVPM0LC|3|pump is good should come with adapters for different size hoses so it fits into differentials better.  This would make it a good product, as opposed to a pain to use like it is now.
B00KXCWVBQ|5|Great!
B003904GHG|4|Great.
B00HLK77YO|5|This thing is awesome and should have came on the truck. I wish I would have bought it sooner.<br /><br />I am not the most mechanically gifted individual but am also not totally inexperienced. With that it mind I was initially a little hesitant about being able to install this myself. I should not have been! It was a piece of cake and probably the easiest thing I have done to my truck. Literally took 20 minutes tops from start to finish. There are some videos online you can find which show the install process but the written instructions that came with the lock were easy enough to follow.<br /><br />I love the fact that I don't have to carry one more key and. I definitely recommend the codable version over the one where you can't use your own key. In my mind it is with the few extra dollars.<br /><br />The fit and function is great and the rear view camera works as it did with the original handle.
B004SS8UUM|5|Good quality strap, Buckle feels sturdy, clip part feels sturdy. All around a good product for a great price!
B00CSEEOU8|5|great kit! all-in-one! easy installation perfect length!! I bought 2!
B00IO9B300|5|I am very happy with Max advanced breaks. They were thorough and made sure I got the correct parts. I did have to go get the package though, that being a mistake on UPS's behalf. Overall, the product and price is great. I will order from them again when in need.
B008EEYWYE|5|Aisin makes a lot of Toyota parts I  have not had. Any issues with my purchase! The only difference between the stock water pump is that it has Toyota stamped on the cast and Also has aisin stamped on it. This is a great deal the price is great and come with everything you need except the thermostat.
B005CYWG7O|3|Was missing one of the marching bears and the dancing skeleton, but the other 5 were of good quality.
B00BJF0CK8|4|good
B00NIOJTIY|1|I would not recommend this product to any body it doesn't fit and it doesn't work. Big waste of time and money.
B00MNY7OFK|3|It never came with a battery. Unable to use it.
B00651C2Z4|4|9-10
B001PH0WUU|1|BLUE CRAP is a better description. Made matters worse, not better...Don`t waste your money or time.
B000COTKDM|4|This winch did the job it's suppose to. It portable and priced right....not sure if this is suitable for constant use, but for the random trips it serves it purpose.
B005HWW6LW|5|Easy to install with no problems, looks good thank u
B0004HDIA8|5|Was going to buy a battery powered buffer to apply wax to my new 2015 Cruze.  I've used stoner products for years, trim shime, interior shine and Stoner More Shine Tire Coating. All great product.  Then I found Bead Max Premiun, This is a the BEST  product for waxing,  I wax my whole car in 1.5 hours. Looks great, thanks Stoner
B0017UBHQS|5|sorry I'm late .. and thanks a lot
B00P3SM34K|1|This tote was advertised as complete and ready to use out of the box. NOT TRUE!!!!! I have owned many waste totes and bought this based on the manufacturers claim of ease of use and no mess. The first time we attempted to use this tote the vent system allowed waste to pour through and the hose actually broke away while in the midst of filling the tote!! NOT GOOD!!!!! We ended up with a cesspool of waste on our feet, hands and under our fifth wheel. Horrible experience to say the least and definitely NOT a &#34;no mess&#34; scenario. Turns out the &#34;complete and ready to use tote&#34; was put together incorrectly or in a very shoddy manner where the vent filter was not connected allowing waste to explode through the &#34;no spill&#34; vent hole and the hose clamp was not connected correctly allowing the pressure to blow the rigid black tubing off the tote. So beware--avoid a nasty situation! If you do buy this tote, make sure it is actually assembled correctly before use. We have attempted to clean and repair this item but are fearful to attempt use again:(
B00GOR64RG|5|Exactly as expected. Fit perfectly and works like a charm
B00MMLIXPO|5|I'm more than satisfied with the quality of this product so far.
B00IKJAHH4|5|shipped to me as they said and the part fit was correct.
B000C822PQ|5|Perfect fit like original.  Seals vapors.  Like it.
B00F8X1XBE|1|It bubbled up and looks awful
B00KV7WSVQ|4|Works fine - got it for 1999 mustang but did not fit - used it on another vehicle & looks good
B004J6ASEE|2|Caution - these are the Akebono style, not the Teves style.  Jeep, in all their wisdom, apparently used two different style brake calipers for at least the 2000 production run of the Grand Cherokee Laredo - probably other years and models as well.  Amazon doesn't track this and I wasn't aware of this when I ordered, so I trusted Amazon's &#34;Guaranteed Fit for your Vehicle&#34; statement.  The pads that arrived did not fit, nor come anywhere close.  See the attached photo - the new pads are these ACDelco's (top), with the bottom being the well worn pads that fit my Jeep.  The top style is the Akebono style, the bottom is for the Teves style.<br /><br />The pads themselves look like they're well enough made, not top of the line but good for the price.  I wish I could write a review to caution other buyers without having to review the product itself, so I am forced to give 2 stars for the fact that even though you'll be told these fit your vehicle, there is nothing in the description that tells you whether they are for the Teves or Akebono style caliper, and if you didn't know that Jeep made multiple styles, then you'd have a 50/50 chance of getting it wrong.<br /><br />For what it's worth - if you look at your calipers and they have a big wire thing attached to the front (the face of the caliper furthest outside on the vehicle), then you have the Teves style and these pads WILL NOT WORK.  If you don't have a wire clip, then these will work because you have the Akebono style.<br /><br />Amazon / ACDelco really should mention the style these pads are for in the description.
B001AM8JKK|5|I like it, It worked very good, no problems for replacement
B003V16KK4|5|Fit perfect and works just as good!!
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Nice hitch and wire harness. Only 30 minutes to install both. No need to remove the rear bumper, on Jeep Unlimited 2015. Use tape to hold nuts on the open end wrench then slid bolt through the frame. Simple
B00GS0O3DG|5|Buick! Just what I wanted and fits well!
B00XM107FC|1|Stay away from this item!!! It is not intended for hellahorn installs, it is a very generic relay used for multi-purpose wiring of other items.<br /><br /> This item was completely confusing to use with a hellhorn install. It came with bullet connections, and there are no bullet connections used in the install. Also, there was not sufficient wiring, causing you to attempt to &#34;stretch&#34; the wires causing damage. After searching for online help with the connections, there was nothing to be found other than some simple &#34;3rd grader&#34; style pics that gave less than a sentence description. Came with no instructions as well. Overall, made to look good, but still made with cheap materials that broke on me. I ended up throwing it away and buying a SUBIMODS V2 plug and play harness!
B007S3KIDQ|5|works great!
B00FS0WGX6|5|Use for upholstery and building animal cages.
B000IY5YGI|5|This replaces the OEM A/C tensioner pulley perfectly.
B00NUEY31U|5|Struts mount easily on my 2005 Scion tC
B005SB6S3Y|5|Received it quickly, and a nice product.
B009APFHSG|5|great way to add to the look of your car - This part fixed my bad handles and gives the car a newer look.<br />So what if they go bad after a few years. Its only 20 bucks. So far so good.
B0002SR7TC|5|This is a great tool for vacuuming oil, tranny, fluid and differential fluid. Very handy. Glad I bought it as it saves me crawling under a car I can't fit under.
B00HS6WKQG|5|Headlights look great and operate perfectly. When they first arrived, I had to return one due to damage during shipping, but a replacement was quickly sent. Customer service left nothing to be desired, and I am thrilled with the newer look of my car. Plus, road visibility at night is infinitely better.<br />(I've attached an image to show the difference they made!)
B001DH4BLI|5|Could not see any difference from the original mirror I replaced with this one. Even came with a new foam insulation part, between the mirror and door... More than I expected. Very happy with the replacement part
B0016ZBP1Q|2|I'm going to give it a three star because,<br />1: My original thermostats had a metal retaining clip these come with annoying plastic clips.<br />2: These thermostats are both different with different temperature settings, it would be helpful if on the thermostat they were labeled which one is the Tstat and which for Eco. they may have been in the package the correct way but the packaging is this form fitting plastic over a thin piece of cardboard, if you manage to get the thermostats free from the packaging without breaking them, most likely you'll have no idea which one is which.<br />3: Aside from that they do work perfectly.
B00ALLYRV6|5|Pretty cool.
B00D9H9BTM|5|Great tool. I used it to check the compression on my 1977 Honda Goldwing engine. It worked fine. I had another compression tester for many years, but gave it away when I thought I wouldn't need it again. Then a friend gave me this bike that really needed a tune up badly. The first thing I did was check the compression so I would know whether it was worth the effort. Now I can get busy with the tune-up. This tool seems to be very well made. It has enough attachments that you should be able to check the compression on just about any vehicle.<br />Jim A.
B00NGOY6XY|5|Perfect Replacement! Easy installation!
B004HP3BJQ|5|What a great product.  Stop wasting your money on filters.  Just rinse it, oil it, dry it and put it back in your car.  Unless of course, you like to keep wasting money on filters.
B00NNFT09G|5|Good I'm happy with them
B00OU5LOT2|5|Just installed on my 2012 Dodge Challenger and it's amazing. If it weren't for dodges weird placement of the 2nd fuse box and weird placement of the dome switch relay I would've activated the door assist feature but even without it I give it 5 stars. Still visible in day light, music setting hits base accurately, great product and highly recommended to everyone.
B000GRZDZY|5|I like this thing. Just added the platforms from pegs I had it over 3 months now. It took a little time to get used to them, but now I can't see going back. I have no problems with leaning the bike or anything else. Vibration gone too, I kind of miss it, it was a nice muscle massage for my legs
B00B2A2COY|5|Was very satisfied with easy and how good the HID light worked on my car.
B00FRHOLK6|1|Despite indicating that this wiper would work for a 2001 Ford Windstar, the center of the blade does not make contact on my windshield.  After searching online, I discovered that mono blades do not work on some vehicles.  Disappointed I wasted money and time on a product that doesn't work for me.  Generally, I think Rain-X products are good, though.
B00066UKM6|4|thanks
B00139WO9C|4|Works great for my jeep tires. Kind of loud. Gauge works too.
B000C3DDKO|5|Added this to my 1999.5 Pathfinder along with an external filter when I replaced the auto transmission with a used 50,000 mile trans. I eliminated the cooler that is part of the radiator and only use this cooler in front of the radiator. This combination should allow the trans to go at least 100,000 more miles without a problem.
B0009OMYC4|5|This tool works just fine for installing your piston rings. Don't spend any more money than this unless you're a pro.
B004AITV9Y|5|Bought set of 4 for 2008 Dodge Charger RT Daytona, had them installed with new tires, of course no extra installation cost.  Tire pressure light is off and working great.
B00UR4O8IE|5|These rock/splash guards are exceptionally easy to install with no drilling required. They provide excellent protection for body panels from rocks and debris from the wheels. A much more subtle and understated look than the blocky factory flaps.
B0009PCPNQ|5|This stuff is fantastic. Husband put a dirty tire on the back seat of our car and left a big, greasy, black stripe. This stuff removed it without even rubbing or scrubbing. The stain completely disappeared. Love it!
B00C73D8V6|3|I like this product, and it functions well.  I will continue to use it in my car.  However, because it was smaller than expected and the label is next-to-impossible to remove cleanly, I can only give it 3 stars.  It will bug me for weeks until I can get this freaking label off.
B00KWDRKKI|5|Nice. Just as described.
B00065ZIJ2|5|Works as advertised. I don't know if it is good enough to protect from theft in all cases. But it is easy to use.
B003SOJV3C|5|I used this on my 95 turbo Volvo it made a big difference its the same part number as the Volvo it seems to work good, definitely made a performance change. The original one was leaking vacuum I never knew how the car actually ran tell I bought this. Good part for a good price.
B000QV0JQ8|1|Does not stay locked. Very  disappointed.
B001810SHA|5|It moves the heat out of the inside
B00BJCN3BG|2|I liked the smell but doesn't last like they say 4 times more than the rest of it, for me its the same not sure if i will buy this item again
B00BCH4WTA|5|The latest in plastic squirt bottle technology. Featuring a non-leak design without holes, rips, tears or cracks in the plastic. Mechanized squirt apparatus ensures liquids will leave the nozzle at appropriate velocity. Does not spontaneously combust under normal operating conditions, nor does it cause heartburn, upset stomach or indigestion.
B005FJ4MGO|4|Good boot. Runs large.
B0013V6NBA|5|Absolutely beautiful.  Very stylish palm trees!  More than lived up to expectations.  Looked great at the site.  Loo even better in person.
B00ON8LO8W|5|Love it , looks great on my truck!!!!!
B008BC8EW0|5|They are nice!
B00JXZJ54A|5|Great service ! I'm 100 % satisfied customer
B000P0VTAU|5|I purchased this to separate the Pittman Arm and Idler Arm from the center link of my Hummer H2. Previously, I tried a ball joint separator from Harbor Freight Tools. Unfortunately, the Harbor Freight separator was not tempered, so I wasted several hours because the forks splayed apart and the ball joints gouged into the forks. Then I purchased this Lisle tool. I was able to remove those ball joints with only 4 hammer blows !  The forks on this separator are so hard, there wasn't even a scratch on them. This demonstrated that Lisle quality tools end up saving money, by preventing me from having to redo work.
B000CQTSO6|3|They are not very quiet, I can hear squeking...
B001EOV492|5|Worked well to connect an 8x5 u haul trailer. Completed a 900 mile trip with no issues. The 2&#34; drop brought me to about 10&#34;-11&#34; off the ground (with Subaru Outback 2011) and the trailer connect safely and as recommended. See picture.
B004A11716|5|As a previous commenter said, do not try to compress this by hand. It wont budge, but put it on the tool box and presto,it works. Not only does it keep the box open, it relieved the problem I had getting the box to open in the first place. No more hanging up on one side.
B008C9YS0Y|5|I purchased this for a 2011 STi and it was a direct fit and fixed the hyper blink. Way easier that load resisters
B000637TNM|5|Best stuff ever. Great deal!!!!
B00455L5WS|5|Gets the job done.
B00D0SIDQC|5|Item was exactly what was ordered and needed
B000IYYFYA|5|thanks
B002QH42W2|5|good
B005GY8VW4|5|Fit perfectly and work properly.
B007OW6M0Y|5|good
B00EC2CG9U|5|I really don't know how to rate a bungee cord other than say they are indeed bungee cords and they are small (as described). The hook ends are also small so it won't hold anything really heavy but are great for light jobs. I wanted these to use to keep the dog gate closed since I was tired of using a string that would eventually knot (if I wasn't careful when I tied it) and have to run up and down the stairs to get a new string. I just put the cord through the fence and hooked both ends together around the post to keep the gate closed. It is easy to open and close again and the cord won't dig into or scratch the surface/pole like wire does.
B002KR5STE|5|Shipped quickly.  Perfect OEM replacement for my VFR.
B000KL73SQ|5|Strong looking mats.
B00852684M|5|Thanks
B00KJ18BI8|5|This light bar has excellent output for the money!! Just recently went through a drive thru car wash and forgot it was there. It survived without a problem. It seems heavy, well built, and took about 3 hrs for me to install(triple checked measurements and also first time installing one). Definitely would by from OPT7 again.
B0058EJ1TE|4|very good value
B00CWNVAPW|4|I bought this for my new 2015 Pathfinder and it took me by surprise at first because it shows so much of the interior of the truck. I can see the whole truck insides along with the outside views. It clipped to the rearview mirror very easily. Give yourself time to stop looking at yourself in the mirror and you will be fine. One point, if you have a high speed mirror with functions included on mirror, keep looking. It worked so well so far that I just ordered one for my daughter's truck. I had to order myself another one because my wife kept the one for her truck after I let her test it out. I like it and I haven't had any issues so far . I will update if I have any issues.<br />UPDATE:<br />I find that if you have a smaller vehicle like a Mercedes GLK-350, this mirror will work , however, it is a bit long to use the sunshades properly so you should know that and order the short ones of this item. I still love it on my Pathfinder though. There is more space between the sunshades. Make sure that you have enough room for it to work for you.
B00DDAB5DA|5|These worked great for connecting the chain drive on my 48-80 cc moped head bike
B00521T8QO|5|Works as explained.only it wasn't polished like I thought
B003CKJDW6|5|The perfect amount to fill my YB12AL-A battery, with some left over.  Great packaging and fast shipping.
B00J4Z9R8I|1|Evidently this one won't fit my dirt bike because there are two different versions and they won't take it back.
B00CMUDOHW|5|no issues installing, used 24mm deep socket. No leaks noticed so far.
B002GZD8JM|3|Don't really work like they should have I really thought they be good but not.
B005FKXRIC|5|Love these brakes.  Couldn't beat the price.  Put them on when I did both front wheel hubs.  Old brakes still good but happy with the upgrade.  No noise and stop better.
B00JMUKIHO|1|Unfortunatley i spent money on this because of the more sport carbon fiber look and it said mazda speed But lesson learned With no exageration i picked up better signal holding my connected aux cord up the air ... If not nothing but static ... SERIOUSLY 1000% dissapointed if i could get a refund i really would
B00KRXK71M|2|This product seemed like it would fit great, but it was a little tight fitting into my Nissan Altima. I've had it on for a month now, and last night the spring snapped. For the hassle of trying to make the part fit,  and now having to order a brand-new part because of the spring problem,  I should've just ordered it through a dealer.  Not happy.
B000J2JE0G|3|it is not bright as my oem bulb
B000P7O5DG|5|I use the refrigerator every time I need to drive to a remote location that is more than a few hours distant. Sometimes when I've reached my destination there is no refrigerator available so I just remove the refrigerator  from my vehicle, carry it inside, and use this to extend the life of my perishables. It works well and I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B004K23KQ0|5|I just added this to my Toyota Tundra. I'm happy with it. I'm 5&#34;3 and my truck is a lifted 4x4. I added a bit of 3m grip tape to it
B00D9C2CDO|4|Used this bag on a recent trip to Cape Cod. The bag keep all water out and fit all I needed it to fit. The straps were a little confusing at first, but once I got the hang of it it was very quick to be put on top of my jeep Cherokee.
B00DNU3O7A|4|Easy to change , need shallow socket to fit nuts to tighten clamp , terminals are slightly flemzy but work good
B00EI6CKVE|1|Not what I was looking for, to graphic and gory.  I wanted something more light, funny.
B00CQNFSPG|5|All good thanks Amazon
B00PYCXS44|5|Works very well and easy to install. Had to buy the backing plate for it to work though.
B00AHJZBCG|5|Thing is seriously bright.
B007KPVX40|2|No instructions or cooler lines, still a great price.
B0063GKHPI|5|very easy to use and my headlights now become very clear.
B0018E4SEG|4|Thick, durable, solid colors.<br /><br />The mats have a tab used to hang up at stores, had to but mine off with scissors(very easy)
B00ZOKJVAG|5|It's very easy to use ,sticks perfectly on window and provides good shade.I highly recommend this product.
B00DT8AYCY|5|We installed two units on my boat for hand hold and they worked out perfect for rough water,
B0052FRWOU|5|Quick delivery - easy to install - work well
B000VL9WSE|5|I bought this as a replacement top. It fit perfectly and it wasn't too hard to put on. The back window part didn't hold up as well as I would have liked but all in all this was a good purchase.
B00ZOKJVAG|4|These do cut down on UV's quite a bit while still providing complete visibility since you can see through them. In my Accord sedan they only cover about 70% of the rear side windows, which allows more full-sun around the edges than I would like. They look decent from inside the windows, but look very bad from the outside of the car, because the plastic gets bubbles underneath it, similar to a failed Walmart tint job..  The pictures are a little bit misleading since they make it seem like one side of the shades are a reflective silver, when in reality it is just a black mesh with clear plastic over one side that clings to the window like an extra-thick piece of saran-wrap. I will get a better set in the future but these will do for now.
B00UGJ1PY0|5|works great  design of this wheel is perfect for karting
B00DBEPM6O|5|Fast shipping, great price!!!
B00Z29FEPK|5|very nice
B00XORKOWU|5|Honestly scared about ordering an off brand pair of mounts for my jk but they fit perfect
B00QSNVU48|5|Great product!
B00020CB2S|5|Great product, great price.
B0080E6FIE|5|Perfect factory replacement, works as described and is equal to or better quality than factory unit. I highly recommend sticking to manufacturer spec parts when working on a BMW and this fit the bill for a good price!
B007137D2W|5|Fixed the problem that was going to cost hundreds of dollars for just a few dollars.
B0066SZ6H2|5|Good replacement.
B00EQ26FPW|5|Seemingly nice quality, arrived in about a week which isn't bad considering they shipped from China.  Interestingly they are marked &#34;Italy&#34; on the back.  They fit our 2005 525i fairly well.  Some reviewers have said they were loose or fell off shortly after installing, what I found was that the fit is easily adjusted by gently bending the ears outward, they engaged the wheel very positively with only minor tweaking.  They are domed and more closely resemble the BMW hood roundel that you find on the front of your car.
B002E1AYKY|5|Heavy-duty jack stands -- just what we wanted!
B00QLIRC06|5|great price, they match the black lugs I also bought, Wheels are safe now !
B0012RN36I|5|Fantastic!! Used a YouTube video to show how to install. Quick ten minutes later and I can pull my camper! Works great, thank you.
B00XNGBGH4|1|A good idea, but the adhesive is not strong enough. It wouldn't stay put, so I used a strong glue instead. That worked, but just for a little while, and then the hinge itself broke.
B00068XCQU|1|I would like nothing more than to write a positive review for The Battery Tender Plus.  Unfortunately I must do the opposite.  I have three units; all have minimal use and have only been used in my garage.  I bought them several years ago and doubt that I have used them (combined) for more than 100 days.  Mostly they are stored in my basement and only used on occasion for recharging boat batteries or to top off batteries in collector cars. The other night I awoke to my dog barking and a terrible electrical burning smell.  I discovered the smell was coming from my basement.  I checked my circuit breakers and all wall outlets and switches.  When the smell continued to get worse and everything appeared secure in my house, I ventured out into the garage.  Upon opening the door, the burning electrical smell hit me like a brick to the forehead.  I turned on the lights and smoke was pouring out of the battery tender.  I quickly unplugged it from the wall outlet and placed it outside allowing it to flame out in the open doors.  Wow, a few minutes later and there would have been a major house fire.  My dog got extra treats for that one!  Well, the following day I called Deltran and explained the story to them.  What amazed me was that there was absolutely no concern what-so-ever for what had happened.  The guy in customer service was only interested in the serial number of the unit.  When I explained that there was not one stamped at the bottom of the unit where he indicated to look, he just replied that it was a PRE-2004 unit and that it was out of warranty and he could do nothing.  As you might expect, I was shocked!  As explained earlier in this posting, regardless of it date of manufacture, this is a lightly used unit and it did not just burn out but flamed out!!!!!!  Had I not handled the situation, my house would have burned down.  Well as you would expect, my other two Battery Tender Plus units have joined this one on the garbage.  What happened to me was bad enough but I lucked out.  You and your family may not be so lucky.  If I were Deltran, regardless of the age, I would want the unit back to see what went wrong to make sure I could correct the problem and to avoid any possible lawsuits which certainly would have been my course of action had things progressed further.  This company not only does not stand behind its product but has terrible customer support and shows no interest in its customers.  Avoid at all costs!!!!  BTW - while there was no serial number, it does have a white sticker on the back saying:  &#34;MADE IN CHINA&#34;............what a surprise!!!!!!!!!!
B000IYJTGO|5|fit my 01 voyager perfectly.  smooth brakes again.
B000HKVDKE|3|Passenger side will not let window roll up without having to push vent shade out of the way. items didn't travel well in shipping package either, numerous scuffs on all of them. Looks like I'm gonna have to modify the r/h side to make it work properly.
B00EQ9FSEO|3|Great add for wind buffeting but surface is too easily scratched.
B00TFZNRV0|5|very good
B0036YW906|1|These DO NOT fit my 2016 NPR vehicle. The driver's side seat cover will fit, but the passenger side seat (which is the same height as the driver's seat) do not fit. Very disappointing, since the the description assured me they would fit.
B000VLHCAE|4|It took almost a month to get all the right parts, but now it is on. The top is squared off, it would conform to the shape of the truck better if the front was 2&#34; wider than the back, but it will perform its function and looks good till you get close enough to see it does not follow the lines of the truck.
B00T2U112A|4|Magnets are pretty strong. Will hold a lot of tools. Perfect for holding my breaker bars since I can't fit them in my tool box.
B0093X1EVE|5|Very pleased with helmet
B005NXMFW0|5|Perfect fit, shipped fast !
B0082365AQ|3|Eh, took this out for the first time today and really didn't have a good time. The thing kept wanting to close back up, didn't want to stay straight, kept slipping off, wheel stays kept rubbing on the tires. I might try to zip tie the cart open (so it doesn't collapse) and try to bungee cord directly to my eyelets, that MIGHT keep it, but the big problem is it keeps wanting to slip backwards, off the rear. Overall, kind of a piece of junk. It's just easier to carry the thing. Do yourself a favor and buy a padded shoulder vest, it's just going to be easier<br /><br />EDIT - 8/3/15 - I am upgrading my review to 3 stars. Now that I have properly secured everything, with materials not included, it works a lot better. What I did was first, zip-tie the housing together so that it can no longer collapse. Second, I ran bungee cords from my kayak, through the frame of this cart, and back up to the kayak, see picture attached (also note the zip ties holding the bungee cords in place, this is mainly to keep them attached to the cart). This works a lot better, I can turn in grass even and the cart stays in place. It shouldn't be this much work, but for the price, I guess this is now a good value.
B00CJF4EBA|5|Makes the TW growl! Not too loud but loud enough to hear me in traffic! Make sure to re-jet the carb to get the full benefit of the pipe.
B00KB0TMWG|1|My fault, I ordered the wrong part. To expensive to return the part.
B00U1R1CDG|5|Pretty durable so far, Have had it for about 3-4months ish, Very big, but carries all my stuff well.
B00AQ2D568|2|is har to use and does not hold bukes in place, almost lost bike twice, will be selling for what ever I can get
B00029K022|1|This product does nothing to avoid sagging. The only difference they made was a stiffer ride (which was undesirable). I can't see them being effective due to the placement on the spring.I tried the other set by this company also and they would not fit on my vehicle. My only suggestion is to purchase a product which spans from front to rear for additional support.
B002X1NLOQ|5|Our original broke because it was plastic, bought this one to realize that it was solid metal. Now I'm sure that it won't break anymore
B004BCF8EG|1|The wastegate I received was not the same as what's pictured, and the one I got had terrible threads that would not hold the spring pressure.
B00DNJQ2YI|5|Way better than my NR heavy duty tarp. Haven't used it through a big storm yet, but from UV and dust this thing can take a beating. Also it doesn't stretch and wear through after repeatedly putting it on and taking it off. Inside is soft and slides over the bike perfectly. Gonna upgrade to a cycleshell pretty soon, but this one is a winner.
B00M5CYW6O|5|Works perfectly!
B00SVGS278|5|Bolted up just fine on my 99 hatchback, opens and closes like new
B004VG88MQ|1|I got the package but there was no instructions with it
B00L1EKGBM|3|good the installation guide leaves a lot to be desired
B007WID078|5|Neat and does the job.
B005GY8W1E|5|Fit perfectly and work properly.
B005LASPB0|3|Tends to not lock into position as well as it should but it does fit as advertised and has the Full batch of hardware to replace the old unit.
B0022ZJX1I|5|if you havent used them, they are a great thicker grip!
B005RJ3GBE|5|I love it
B000CO7N5Y|5|worked great
B00V5QSAUU|5|Very good quality. Well worth the price.
B0089HXRP6|5|Nicely made. I didn't attach it to the dash and was worried it would blow away but it stays put even with the windows open. Nice look!
B009P8A044|5|with this interface, it is like Im using a factory system
B000O0JQSS|5|Snapped right in.
B0049MZN16|5|Great Product, Great Price, Fast Delivery,
B00499UZGC|5|Great product - Thanks!
B004A75MAW|5|excellent product arrived quickly
B001MS229Q|5|Great product - Thanks!
B00PJPHEBO|5|This thing worked right out of the box, no DOA issues, and no other problems. I moved it between several cars and it didn't lose a beat.<br />It paired easily with my Android tablet running Torque Pro. I never lost connection and it provided consistent data.<br />Just as a test, I took it to my brother who is the head of Auto Tech at our local college and asked him to check it over, too. (Since he has all of the expensive scan tools, etc.) He said it worked great and as he dug down into Torque, he said the device was completely reliable, in his opinion.
B003K5S4NW|4|Works well on my big sloped windshield (Toyota Venza).  I was surprised how well the terri cloth gets the hazy film off with little elbow grease.  Recommend you get a package of the Detailer's Choice 6-365 bonnets for replacements
B006GJN7GS|5|Fast shipping, rubicon express showed great quality and smooth suspension.
B00EQ26FPW|3|Chinese knockoffs - will play the part if needed. Original center caps are 30+ at the BMW dealer.
B00B9D0MZK|5|Took a while to receive but worth the wait
B001T4SK2Q|4|Conformable, you don't feel them . I wish they would have a flier for guys. No instruction how to put the side pads, hard to figure out. I wish they would put them in and if you don't want them, you can take them out. No crush so far to see if they actually work, and I hope I'll never find out
B004EQC5AO|5|The product was exactly as described. I returned it because I apparently order things too late at night. I wanted a satin or brushed stainless cover with 4 holes. Ordered a polished with 2 holes. Seller and product get 5 stars. Buyer gets 1... Maybe.
B0042L46GW|4|Installation was fairly easy and so far it looks great, although the one I received was different than the one I ordered!
B000ND0WB6|5|Good!
B00E8UC7BS|5|Great Helmet.  Fits and breaths well.  Looks Awesome!!!  Whatever your size is go up a size.
B00RK6H19K|5|excellent, on time delivery
B001FAO8I4|1|Terrible quality. I pumped up my mountain bike once before the hose connection blew and the metal buckled.
B00PU0MODG|5|Fits well on the wheel and makes steering smooth. Light but sturdy.
B001KAQJI6|5|It fit perfectly, everything is working great so far. The best thing is I saved a bunch of money $$$$$ !!!!!
B006EKNHN2|5|A are great wiper !  Fits rear of 2012 Ford Escape. Perfect replacement, no issues !  Thank You
B0062IJURS|1|Looks nice, but it dont fit right, the right bottom bolt needs to be 1/4 inch longer I was told the 23rd of july, they sent me a replacement hardware,  aug. 1st  , and have not got any yet, so it cant be used,
B003054ZFI|5|Great
B005K79I60|5|Work great, very bright.
B004QXRA00|5|👍
B008PW6A68|1|Is a used product very bad!
B000C9DCHW|5|Part arrived in 3 days and is functioning perfectly. I now have cold A/C in my car again! Most repair shops wanted to replace my entire compressor when all I needed was the clutch assembly. Saved me about $500.00!
B001HZNK04|3|Didn't fit my car.  Looks like its made of good materials tho.
B00CYOEHM2|5|Fit my 2001 Jeep Wangler, old one  popped out with the help of a long handles screw driver in the set hole at the bottle of the column, and new one popped right in. Works great. Great price for Original Equipment
B00KX1109Q|5|Great light super bright and heavy duty I will buy more
B004A6MC7O|4|Packaged well, and shipped on time. Fit perfect on my '99 TJ. Hope it last a long time.
B00EA0ZB7I|3|I only gave these lights 3 stars because of the price. They are only as bright as regular headlights on dim. They would be good for back up lights but as far as front facing offroad lights- nah.
B00C908EQ6|2|cheap. scratches and scuffs when trying to remove air bubbles even with felt covered card. also is very pale yellow not 3000k (I have them in hids) like advertised. looks more like dirty white. wouldn't buy again and removed from vehicle right after install.
B00Y1VWM5A|5|This thing has so many setting.  I been trying to learn all the different things it can test.  And it has it all.  It's got so many options.  This is definitely a professional voltage tester.  I love the back lit screen for night time or dark use.  And for the price.  This is just as good as paying for the high end voltage tester. But for just a few bucks.  Great product. It will do it all.
B008NA2VB0|5|proudly representing my first unit in the Army on my refrigerator, car, and truck.  thank you for making these
B00852QTIC|5|it smells awful but a lifesaver! love that the wheels easily come off for storage.
B006GTZ5V8|4|Looks great and feels durable. It's been on for a couple months now and there have been no issues. Color and fit has been retained.  It is not a perfect fit though. You have to play around with them a little bit. My 07 Chevy Cobalt didn't want them on I guess XD With some minimal shifting/elbow grease it went on perfect.
B003V57NUQ|1|It didn't fit , although it said it would. Still waiting for my refund.
B00BCRMBGQ|4|Front seats fit great, but do not secure well to the seat . They slide a little. Back seat top portion is perfect, but the bottom does not work with my seats, so I had to leave it off.
B004ROMJIQ|4|I was very pleased with the accuracy on the estimated delivery date. Item came the exact day as expected. The item seems to be decent quality. The packaging could have been a bit more professional looking.
B001DKRKGS|1|wimpy garbage.  I am returning this.
B001NB6AJU|5|How crazy is this: my friend sits next to me with his laptop and does changes to the ignition curve, activates/deactivates vacuum advance and we can feel and meassure the results without even stopping the car !!!  Perfect Distributor if who can handle a PC application and want to squeeze the maximum out of your engine and or experience the difference of various setups. In my case there was no alternative solution as I have an extreme 347 in my 68 Cougar which needs a lot of early advance.
B006R7AW6M|4|Form, fit, and function are as expected on my 08 silverado.
B001KOA5VO|5|Absolutely stunning pipes. They look and sound awesome.. Felt an immediate response in power. I also bought the cobra intake and Fi2000 my bike is a whole other animal now.. And shipping was fast it arrived a day ahead if schedule
B004GE04RU|3|It says it won't fit RAV4's with a tow package.<br />It doesn't mention that it doesn't fit many of the others either.<br /><br />The one I received would not fit over the brackets holding the AC condenser.<br />(It was easier to dremel openings than return it, though it now looks a bit shabby.)
B005BNG1U4|5|Look nice and helps seatbelt  from cutting into my neck.
B000Y84J6O|5|After my synthetic cable broke within about 90 days I went back to this and don't intend to change.  Not taking the risk of getting stranded with a synthetic cable.
B00BCRMBGQ|2|super thin material, think thinner than a tshirt.  instructions are less than helpful.  couldnt figure out how to install the back seats.  seems like it was made for all types of configurations.  this is not to say that its shortcommings arent a reflection of my own, but caveat emptor.  the only saving grace was i didnt spend very much money on them.
B0031ZDU62|5|Complete set. Fit great. Work great. came on time, well packaged. I would recommend and use again.Very happy.
B000CMIXZA|2|First off, Why does Mr Gasket charge so much for these. I purchased a set and the shrink wrap they used for packaging was older, but I had to use a razor blade to free it from the package it was glued into. The tape also pulled off some of the printing because from packaging and thank gawd the needed part was in the center of the roll. I used brake cleaner on the pulley first, then lightly sand and wiped with a clean cloth. Work from under the vehicle and roll the as you place it. I then placed a finger smug of silicon on the start and end of tape to keep it from creating a wing and taking flight. The tape is pretty crappy stuff as for being sticky. If the manufactures were smart, they would create it out of that really sticky Aluminum tape they use in duct sealing and Home AC units. That stuff is the ultimate tape for something like this needs. I better go patent that idea right now, cya!!!!
B0050LJS48|5|Replacement for the same cover I had for 5 years but got too dirty to clean again.  Good fit and keeps RV cleaner inside.

B00027GU14|5|Fit great, glad to have reinforcing rings around cylinders.
B00CD2RB64|3|Installing the weather stripping was a nightmare but once they are on they look great and are durable
B005ERW8YK|1|Bought it because it was cheap but it doesn't work. I will buy one of the others and maybe send it back but don't know why because I don't want another one!<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ERW8YK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
B000CB6D0S|5|Just what we needed!
B00R3O0Y0M|5|I installed these on my 2014 Subaru Forester XT. There are two factory horns (one located under passenger headlight and the other in front of radiator) and I used the factory horn relay. Installation was pretty simple and straight forward. Sounds and looks GREAT!
B007G2KR3A|5|A dream product for an &#34;OCD&#34; guy like me.  I'd been totally frustrated with those big metal corkscrew stakes and the plastic hammer-in stakes just didn't want to hold down my awning.<br /><br />At first glance, they look like a plastic thing that won't survive drilling into questionable ground at RV campgrounds, but they are STURDY.  (Must be the fiberglass.)<br /><br />I couldn't find one of their metal &#34;hardcore adapters&#34; to attach to my cordless drill on Amazon (USA), but the size you want is 11/16&#34; - I used a socket and an adapter for my cordless drill.  (The plastic adapter that comes with the kit will work, but I'm happier with a metal power socket driver for the long term.)<br /><br />Let me repeat my joy... With cordless drill in hand: ZIP ZIP and the stake is firmly in the ground with a handy line attachment!  On departure day, ZIP ZIP and the stake is out of the ground and in my hand!  Thank you Tim Browne and all the folks at Peggy Peg in Australia for this wonderful invention!
B001ZTUWFI|5|Perfect...just enough tint to keep down the glare of the sun but people can still see my smiling face !
B00XHRF0PI|5|Perfect  fit
B0050QIJ0W|3|I like the look a little smaller than I though they function well but I had to cut and weld the brackets to fit my bike
B00GEAHG2U|1|No acid included?
B000M61JFC|5|Great fuse assortment for the money . It'll be nice to have these around when needed
B007N6YWQM|5|heavy duty arms. will get my business again.
B004AQXIZY|5|Nicer little socket for those shift shaft bushings, and it makes it easy to remove and install them when resealing your lower unit
B000C2WB1C|5|Perfect fit for my 06 Elantra manual transmission
B00KCQSM9S|5|I am very pleased with this seat covers. They are easy to install and they look great.
B0057RA7CM|2|Sides attach to trim around rear side windows by hooking the edge of the trim with plastic non-scratching hooks.<br />After about a month of use the hooks have changed shape I guess and will no longer hold tight.<br />This reduces the tightness of the cover, leaving it attached by velcro straps around the middle seat head-cushions, and elastic bands around hooks just inside the rear cargo door. The cover is still functional, but it's an annoyance that it no longer attaches completely.
B0002RNSKK|2|I'm not super impressed. I chose this product for the LED indicators, but they don't all work correctly for me. Only one of the LED's worked for me and I thought my wiring in my car was faulty. I had it tested, though, and proved my car wiring is just fine and this product isn't working as intended.
B0051SUMJA|5|A little tricky to adjust, but once they are lined up right, the hood stays secure, and is easy to release when needed.
B001C9C09C|5|Worked great thanks again.
B000IG208Q|4|Fit the visor great on Chevy Express 4500, reasonably built, just what was needed.  Good product
B006K8V9LA|5|works fine fits fine problem solved
B00G3BRNVY|5|Best oil on the market!!!!  Does what it claims and has been proven by multiple magazines and independent labs. No need to say more!!
B002XM5G70|4|do not tighten those little fittings too much they do not have it in them to hold up had to order a third pump.
B0042HU3GS|5|I have fallen in love with Chemical Guys products over the years.  This is an amazing wax with great shine. Also, it last a long time, unlike some other waxes. If you let it dry to a good haze for several minutes you won't be disappointed.
B00U3A0ZLG|5|worked great FAST shipping!!! product fit the mini bikes properly the price was fair and shipping was fast
B005VWRAIC|5|Worked like a champ!!! After 45 min install time (start to finish, first time installer time), saved myself $300.00 on labor. Wonder what these professional mechanics used the other 1 hr 15 min to do:-) Good luckl
B00NXNR2L6|5|Did the job! Good purchase for the price.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Exceeded Expectations
B003K2X2AU|5|Exact fit for our 10' Grand Caravan SXT. As described.  Packaged well and arrived faster than estimated.  Hopefully this will be a fix for the ongoing Dodge death wobble caused by warped rotors. Paired with a set of Hawk performance brake pads.
B000EH0ORI|5|What a great siphon a must for boater's
B00BNH5ZX6|5|Amazing  starter kit i changed 11 of the 17 capacitors and had a successful repair
B0002TDUW4|5|This stuff worked great inside a chicken coop.
B00O0Z0ZGU|2|It's noticeably darker than my factory paint after drying. Possibly due to fading as my vehicle is now 8 years old. Dries on white paper in a matching tone, just looks different on the car. I highly suggest testing in an inconspicuous area before using.
B008CF8DEA|5|Beautiful! Fits my 08 Civic Lx and makes it looks Amazing without painting it! Shipping kinda chipped the tips of the top of the hood on the left side a teeny tiny bit.. But really a good buy! Recommend it to everyone with any trim model for the 8th Gen Civics looking for a hood!
B00UW4DJF2|5|Very nice item works great!
B00H29LRE0|3|they wouldnt keep my engine cool enough and i have a 4.3 vortec but they work great as pusher fans in front of the a/c condenser so if your lookin to keep your engine cooled they wont do it but if you need pusher fans they work great
B004J9FVTS|5|Yea - fixed my Buick - i do not need 2 people to look under the hood now
B00H5A4F22|5|huge mirror and takes some getting use to I love mine arrived quickly too
B000C70IGW|5|Thankfully, this brake cylinder was still available and being a Raybestos made the purchase an easy and confident thing to do!
B0026OKUS0|4|Thought it was gold. Came silver still a nice peice. Easy instalation
B00P1LAGJ8|3|Tape could be stickier
B00Y2CJ95O|1|Edit- After two months one will only stay on for 15 seconds then flicker out. Also the paint is becoming very ashy. Look like they're several years old after 2 months.  Removed them from the box and one had something rattling in it. So I took apart the light assembly and found a &#34;spare&#34; screw in between the circuit board and reflector housing. After taking the extra screw out and reassembling, it no longer rattled. Installed these as backup lights on my truck. My only concern is how easily the paint chipped/peeled as I bolted them down. I fear they may begin rusting, I attempted to touch the paint up. They look good for now, it has been about 2 weeks since installing.  Update- After a year the paint is completely falling off and they are corroding severely.
B0032J1KAK|5|Provides great extended vision to cars on both lanes.
B00EMKBRMO|5|Perfect for the Jeep/animal lover!!
B008M7SVBS|5|works great
B00G0OPIGG|5|Great price!
B001H1QFKK|5|Very satisfied, original part and fits perfectly. Delivered on time as stated.
B00E4VXQ1G|2|This was suggested as able to be used to replace a broken antenna on our car.  It came with no instructions, adapters that were unmarked as to size, and no phone number or website to get any outside assistance.  We are still with an broken antenna, and sent this one back.
B00B603NXY|5|Fit bolts on a 2016 Maxima.
B003EP52BU|5|Thank you
B01335XXV6|5|This LED strip light is better than me esperava.La price / quality ratio is very good.The perfecto.Lo've tried sending a transformer 120W laptop i 6.5A, with much less work igual.Aconsejo this product.
B00890N6A4|5|My husband helped me install this bezel on my JK Jeep. The original bezel broke from its base. We did not remove the shift knob and worked together to install the new bezel bolts, washers and screws on the base. You will need to pry the base off the console. Also, we needed to remove the broken tabs from the base by punching them out with a small screw driver. The new bezel is definitely an improvement in terms of quality over the plastic factory part. In my opinion, I think this bezel will last a very long time.
B00B46UJZU|5|Awesome fitment on my 2011 YZ450F. This is hands down the best bang for your buck upgrade for your 4-stroke. Low end torque increased while letting the top end come alive and just keep pulling. If you are worried about weight then get the full titanium/Stainless steel/carbon fiber. Unless you are a pro rider the weight is a non issue.
B00199BWTE|4|Good product exact fit.
B00FSCALMM|5|Was perfect got it on time thank you.
B0069VTGPE|5|Knew I wanted a L2 EVSE when I purchased the car and had it installed a day after driving home.  Luckily I already had a NEMA 14-50 outlet installed for the welder in the garage, so basically plug and play.  I did have to mount it upside down for the pigtail to reach the outlet so no docking in the cable holder.  Easier and quicker to not have to walk around the car to put the cord away anyway.  Haven't had a bit of issue with anything.  Overkill in the 7.2KW capacity since the car can only charge at 3.3KW, but I am future proofed for the next EV purchase or whatever. I liked the fact that this is basically a industrial quality EVSE and not some cheap consumer variety.
B000QIBVRW|5|Perfect fit replacement.<br />I'm surprised that GM hasn't made a detail change to this model van.  Auto designers seem to change things just to be changing them sometimes.<br /><br />Not only was the part exactly the same the color was too!
B00YQEZIWQ|4|Work great & looks great!
B001C6Q8CK|5|Great part fits my jeep yj perfect.
B004RCRA6O|5|Way better than stock replacements
B001BDJY5M|5|This adds some bling to à boring license plate
B00R37WNBC|5|Love the gas cap pad it looks so nice, tank pad is good too great quality so far.
B001O7PNS2|5|Just as advertised, great for a quick shine.  Also nice that it doesn't chalk up on plastic parts.
B008GZV0FU|5|Perfect
B005PZMLDY|1|Covers not compatible to real seat as they sold as compatible to Toyota Prius 2009.<br />Not recommended.
B00N83SZR6|5|These are good items.  The ability to smoke a cig and not &#34;pollute&#34; the air is a great thing.  They do leave a pleasing odor.
B0009OMYDS|5|This tool is amazing in cleaning rims, engine bays, door jams, ect.  It is extremely durable.
B009ESAZHW|5|Very fast delivery love it!:)
B00TVWFOQS|5|Very bright and a very solid product. Returned because they didn't fit in my Harley Sportster. But not their fault.
B003UPVRMM|5|Fits Perfect, Fast Delivery, Great Product, Great Price
B00P3FR2ZS|5|Genuine parts from Toyota at a better price than I could get at my dealership.  Installation was not that hard if you take your time, follow instructions, measure precisely.
B008N1YXVA|5|Fast and great product
B003SZKOBO|4|The fit was perfect on my 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer, It looks great
B00EFDAJBI|5|02 Tahoe rear lift glass (top split). Fit right in, quick install. Will buy main lift gate ..and this one again when needed.
B000K1CFXO|2|It's mediocre at best for Delphi's Weatherpak connectors.  It'll do the job, but it sure isn't pretty.  I wouldn't buy this again; I'd use my common crimper or needle nose pliers.<br /><br />My advice?  Keep shopping.
B00BEB4EK6|3|I have a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and I needed some new clips for my driver door. I replaced all the door clips but still have a few that pop loose. The clips fit in the holes, but not a strong hold. (Not sure if it's my door, but still expected better)
B001L9XQYG|5|A+
B007OSL3DY|5|Protects the truck tailgate from theft & installation can't be any easier.
B00F26ZKAW|5|Love it! Easy apply, looks great.
B000WMRK04|5|Helmet fits as described. I thought it came with a tinted visor as well but doesn't. Just a basic helmet, nice though especially for the price.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product and extremely affordable.
B00G6DE8KS|5|Awesome lights. Love them on my 2015 Soul. Thank you so much. Had to bend the metal piece a lil bit for the some lights to fit. Works and look great.
B000C9SP4W|5|Excellent Original Product for my Caddy
B00466AJ6Y|5|Badass
B00HJ158ZA|5|Exactly as described
B000CSD2IM|5|GOOD DEAL
B00E5OUOCQ|1|didn't fit 2015 Camry hybrid
B00JMZP432|4|Simple key without transponder great for a spare. At a great price. Shipped fast.
B0031H8RLS|5|Exactly as expected, good quality appearence, perfect fit and solved my problem.
B00RWPY2QE|5|Love this sticker!! This is the second one I have purchased and I always get compliments on it. The quality is great and send to last about 9 months before needing to be replaced.
B0049L6NRU|5|Exactly what my car needed,fit was great. Car does sit just a touch higher but I suspect it will settle as the springs get broken in.
B00LB2QW12|5|My nephew loves this thing.  It's a bit smaller so it fits his hands perfectly (he's 10).  It's very solid construction.  The tools are pretty small on it so I wouldn't recommend as your primary multitool
B0015FYQ90|3|I have a Nissan Altima.  The extension does add some view to the Right Rear blind spot, but signficant downside is that you lose the &#34;night vision&#34; position of the mirror.  Also some cars (like the Altima) have large headrests in the passenger compartment, which block the additional view the mirror provides.  While it's fairly stable at city driving speeds,  it does tend to vibrate with minor bumps and high speeds.  Overall not worth the $$ due to these issues.  I found it more distracting than helpful.  It might be a better value on different model cars.
B005PZ0MTY|5|Perfect OEM fit!
B00LSK2VXA|1|WILL NOT WORK WITH 2001 MUSTANG!! WASTE OF MONEY......
B000C6ZT8U|5|super high quality reman.  With no core charge
B00OGOTVJC|1|Did not work on initial start up. One of them even exploded. I had resistors installed so to avoid any electrical failure. Still failed  Would not recommend.  company/seller has ignored my multiple attempts to get some replacements.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING FROM THEM.
B00NAR2DYQ|5|I bought these lights to replace the stock headlights that came on my older Kubota B6100D tractor. The description says they are '4 inch', but actually they are closer to 4.5 inches. If you are just mounting them on a bumper or brush guard this would not matter, but in my application a 4 inch light was needed to make it a clean, simple install.<br /><br />I was going to send them back, but after testing one light and seeing how bright it was, I decided to keep them and modify the inside of the hood so they would have a flush fit and look stock.<br /><br />I have to say they look really good and work great. The lights draw very little power and yet are super bright. They really light up the night. Also, the build quality seems to be very good.<br /><br />Because these are such nice lights, I have to give them 5 stars regardless of their size.
B0027HX2ZO|5|Worked perfectly as needed.  Would buy again without hesitation.
B004ZF4F7A|5|Best HID kit ever bought !!!!
B0085XH58O|5|Exc purchase
B00Q8CVLW0|5|Recommended fluid for Hondas. Have used nothing else & car is 19 years old w/ no hydraulic issues.
B009IMYSNQ|5|Saved me from a trip to the bodyshop already
B000BRQ0TW|5|worked wonders
B007EHOWNI|5|Fit great on the RX300.
B000CITK8S|4|Well made maintainer. Comes w/ variety of attachment methods. Ring terminals too small to fit auto side terminal batteries(good only for smaller batteries)
B004B8DQHQ|3|Mirrors are never threaded exactly how i need them but they work.
B000C5A1DE|5|Fit perfectly. Had to rent a ball joint removal and installation tool from advance auto for free. Having the right tool made the job extremely easy.
B000C0UQSY|4|After hearing a chirping serpentine belt, I decided to replace both the idler pulley and tensioner unit.  Because the belt is less than 3 years old it should be OK.  During installation, I found the old original tensioner spring was weak and allowed the belt to jump on the A/C compressor drive.  This damaged the belt so I replaced it too.  The new tensioner is significantly stronger.
B004XRTEYE|3|I love the message, but now it's getting a bit rusty after six months.  : (
B000S2UGWC|5|sorry I'm late .. and thanks a lot
B0002KKIVY|5|I use this product on all my small engine equipment. Lawnmower, ATV, generator etc. All equipment not used regularly should be stored in accordance with mfg instructions. Starting up with Tune-up really works. I also add some to the fuel once in awhile. Can't hurt.
B00H5A4F22|5|I WILL NOT CHANGE MY OPINIONS AND FACTS REGARDING TODAY'S DRIVERS. AS I STATED TOO MANY DERANGED DRIVERS WHO SHOULDN'T BE IN POSSESION OF A DL.
B002SB03IS|5|Genuine Toyota part.  Fits my Tacoma perfectly.  Very thick and nice and heavy.  Nice tacky feel that will do much to keep stuff from sliding around on the bed.  Came from a Toyota dealer in Greensboro NC in two days.  Free shipping plus I paid no tax and the cost was $10 less than my local Toyota dealer where I would have had to also pay tax.  Great deal.
B0029XJVA6|5|I just make the cloth slightly damp and it cleans the interior windshield easily.  I always hated to clean the interior of the windshield and back window because of the very awkward angles and the straining I had to do to get it clean.  Other reviewers have complained about the unit being flimsy and easily broken.  I did not have the same experience, I did not use excessive pressure while cleaning, as it may not withstand cleaning with strong elbow grease and doing so is not necessary. Regardless, it is a good investment if you hate cleaning the inside of a windshield as much as I did (do), till now.
B0067UERWE|3|Not a fit in any form or fashion for My 1998 S70 Volvo so it must be returned ( shame ). I think application data should be updated to prevent this type of mistake, although looking at picture should give a clue to a Non fitting part also .( Beware)
B009IYV0JO|5|Kind of a pain to get the OEM pieces unscrewed at the top (on the hatch) but now I don't have to be pulling up on the hatch anymore and I pop it, and lots more strength when the hatch lifts up.
B00VNBDWPK|4|I was able to install these bulbs into my 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid. They do provide more light compared to the standard halogens. These lights are great for up close. The way these bulbs light up the left and right side is good, but not so great for distance. I guess I am use to the HID lights from Audi. But it is unfair to compare HIDs to LEDs. For the price, these are good bulbs if you don't want to spend the $$$ for HIDs and the pain in installing them. These are just plug and play.
B00Q5E4JE8|5|[[VIDEOID:424d831bd1cd248cb3ab1c58bc3cf4d0]] I am not a smoker, but I definitely eat food in my car, and most of the time I forgot left over or food trash inside my car which is not a good smell. Specially to my wife.<br />My video will show the unboxing and how to use it, and there I said in 5-10 mins it reduces the smell.<br /><br />However, after 30mins after my review video. I picked my wife, and she is surprised that my car smells differently good. And mind you, she is pregnant, for those of you who dont know, pregnant women has a heightened sense for smelling. So it definitely does work. Check out my video to know more, if you have problems viewing it. go here. [...]<br /><br />Product Provided for my honest, unbiased review.
B005QQDET2|5|This is premium industrial quality in all respects. Works exactly as advertised and my local fire inspectors were impressed.
B00HJ1592C|5|Love it!
B010H0QV7S|4|I've been meaning to get a safety tool for my car, so when I was offered this one free for review, I jumped at the chance.  It's a BYOB (Bring Your Own Batteries) model, but once those were installed, it works quite well.<br /><br />I have trouble using the old-fashioned kind of tire gauges, the kind where the little metal rod pops out of the metal casing.  This one is easy to use, and the measurement on all 4 of my tires seemed accurate.  Of course, first I had to change the display to show PSI, the scale I am most familiar with.<br /><br />I was afraid this digital display would not work in the sun, but it is easy to read both on bright sun and in shadow.  The flashlight is bright with a fairly narrow focus.  The little red LED light works as well, but I'm not sure what it would be useful for.<br /><br />There is a blade for cutting seatbelts in the little open u-shaped end.  Being willing to take one for the team, I tried to see if I could get my fingers in there, if it were a cutting hazard for fingers.  No, not for adults, but this should still be kept away from children.<br /><br />My husband assures me that the pointy window-breaking thing will work quite well.  Apparently, those pointed little ends are very effective, small as they are, for breaking those temepered glass, safety glass windows.<br /><br />I do wish the plastic part felt a little more substantial, but it seems adequate if not stellar.<br /><br />People around here have a tendency to drive into canals, and most of them, but not all, get out.  I don't drive drunk or drugged, so am not so likely to drive into a canal but if I do, this tool could get me out of the car.<br /><br />But most importantly, I am going to keep this for the @#$%#@$@ that lock their children or pets in a hot car here in the desert, or anywhere it is hot.  If you see that, call 911 immediately - it doesn't take long for a child or a pet to die, but they suffer first.  As for me, I'll call 911 while I am breaking out the window if there is no other way in - consequences be danged.<br /><br />DON'T LEAVE YOUR CHILDREN OR YOUR PETS IN HOT CARS!dow if there is no other way in - consequences be danged.<br /><br />DON'T LEAVE YOUR CHILDREN OR YOUR PETS IN HOT CARS!
B004KEIF4U|1|red grippers tore off, didn't grip filter at all. left me halfway through an oil change.
B0048J4PKK|1|not the right part for 2000 like add says.  Needs additional electrical contacts that cant be added. also started making a bad loud sound right after install.  very poor product and now they wont take it back.
B000BQWLE6|1|Not much of a trash can... I don't think there's enough space even to take a few cans of anything.
B00CMQROB8|5|worked great
B0009JKI86|1|I bought 2 of these blades (22&#34; and 26&#34;) based upon the fact that Amazon indicated that they would fit my car. The wipers were useless to me because they did not make good contact with the windshield on my 2007 Honda Civic sedan. Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return the wiper and I bought a beam style blade that worked correctly.
B00GWSFYDC|5|This fit our new Tucson Hyundai.  Made of good quality, price was also good.  Item arrived before date that was quoted.  Very satisfied and would recommend.
B00SCY3HP6|4|Not very bright like it claims, the illumination distance is far
B00XZ9PFXU|5|Fits well
B00UEABZU0|3|Fit is a little snug for what the sizing chart recommends. But for the price its a decent helmet if your not wearing it for long periods of time. The tinted visor is a little flimsy, and isn't quite long enough. But for the price you can't beat it, its a good helmet for someone that doesn't ride much.
B005KDO9UY|3|Replaced my stock high beam bulbs on my 2015 Subaru WRX STI that act as DRLs during the day. The stockies were orange colored as the DRLs use the high beams at 60% intensity. So I swapped out with these hoping they would be whiter and no look so yellow next to the stock LED low beams. The reviews stated that they were similar to HID. They are not. They are slightly less yellow than the stock bulbs. Leaving them in for now until they come up with something better.
B00HSFAR80|5|Great OEM Fitment. Seems high quality. Nissan Sentra 2011.
B00HRSTNGU|5|Great product! Nice and bright!
B00A9T28QG|3|A decent spray wax, but it's much harder to use than other spray wax. The result isn't anything impressive for the extra buffing required and it could only be used with black cars. Plus it will ruin your white microfiber tower or clothes. I like their ICE lines much better, even their entry wax & dry spray wax produce a better shine.
B011Q18D14|5|Works perfect, I used it on my daughters car it found the problem I bought the part, cleared the code and she passed her inspection. Not only did I save 100 diagnostic fee but the 50 the dealership charges to reset the codes. Well worth the money, my dad is ordering one to have in his garage.
B00CFLCVFE|4|Switches are of good quality. They work fine and easily soldered to.
B004AQXG3I|5|Very good
B0049W0NVQ|4|Maybe a little brighter but not much different than stock. Slightly more of a white light
B00KST6D2W|4|I works in my car for my sister (smile)
B001PP7GWE|5|Perfect fit! Can be used for all trailers...
B008XKLAFI|1|Does  Not work with 2003 Forester.
B000Q0PEQE|4|Shipping was early, worked great easy install.
B000ARTZPO|5|I have a 2003 Lexus RX300 with 155k miles on it. I began to notice a &#34;bog&#34; in shifting from 1st to 2nd when starting out. Some days worse than others. But steadily becoming more consistent. I bought a bottle of this stuff for the heck of it just to see if it would work and save me a trip to the transmission shop. What an amazing difference. Added the bottle to the existing tranny fluid. I was down about 1/2 a quart anyhow, so I just added the whole bottle. Ran the car up and down the street a few times, and it worked! Transmission runs smoother, no more shifting issues and honestly everything seems to be running quieter overall. So, if you are having an issue with your transmission, take a shot at a $12 fix from Lucas before spending big $$ on a transmission.
B000JZURAE|5|Hydraulics are great. I had a hard time getting the depressed enough to install but once I got past that I haven't had any issues
B002PQMRVC|3|Plastic tabs were broken and bulbs are dim. But looks great and perfect price.
B00K6BRC9U|1|I hate writing bad reviews but I feel it is more important to remain honest. This rope broke on the first use, I know how to use a rope, I know about sharp angles and knots effecting the strength of the rope, this rope was not shock loaded, it did however snap with one use, I am glad I have a backup. I would not recommend this as a winch rope.
B000CB6FNS|4|Good product but I think next time I will go with the RS7401 which is a charged dampener as it's a little more heavy duty.  I run larger tires on my 94 jeep cherokee and while it works well I still run into a slight bit of shake.
B005UTS6FW|5|Bought a set of these for my daughter as part of &#34;pink-mobile&#34;.  They fit perfectly and she LOVES them.  That they help fund breast cancer research is a GREAT plus!!
B008747EV4|2|Will not buy again, removed OE amber lens and immediately noticed the size deference. To make this install and work like original equipment you have to file down the edges 1mm and wet sand the lens to bring it back to new. To install these with out chipping the paint or causing any damage, remove the old lens buy pushing the side close to the front end in and with a plastic bar for trim push the locking tabs away from the front apron, then remove the bumper strip by pulling towards you. now you can install and pre fit everything without damaging the paint since these are a bit to large. Also note they are shipped from china watch the shipping when at check out.
B004DRWP54|5|great
B00MPF2KU6|5|Fit perfectly.  No crystals to worry about falling off.  Has nice shimmer.
B001KSE11K|4|I have a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo,I bought this to replace my driver side mirror. The fit is about 95%, but the only thing I can recommend is get more adhesive for the back. It comes with two small sticky strips, and after attached the mirror bounces around a good bit. I'm not saying it will fall off, but hard to focus on what you're looking at while the mirror is bouncing around. Kinda hard to see, so I definitely recommend getting more adhesive strips before attaching
B0068ETRR4|5|Good item, fasr shipping, excellent updates communication.
B00IY3YLCI|1|The paint on these peels off very quickly, which leave a very ugly chipped.  The light itself is not very strong.
B0012GTVVA|5|We love this little beauty! Personally, I don't know why trailer manufacturers don't make these a standard on travel trailers. This bar is so helpful!
B000H961YI|4|good product
B000BWDZAO|4|The product is in good condition works well
B00877SL2M|5|Thanks so much
B00801RJ8C|5|They fit
B00JNINL1U|3|broke after second use buy 3 or 4
B00C2SXD20|2|The front mats fit great the back mat was not a great fit in my 2014 F150 XLT  s-crew. But I will probably do a little extra trimming on them
B0007M1ZGE|5|Installed in less than 10 minutes. Very sturdy.
B00X31V70K|5|This was an outstanding purchase for me. Not only was the service outstanding but the product is very nice. I have had many compliments as to the amber front and red tail lights. They are an excellent item and look to cost a lot more. They were easy to mount and truly uniiversal. They just look classy. Buy them you will be glad you did.
B00VBK7GEG|3|After installing I found that one is slightly brighter than the other, they share the same circuit. It is a spot, but it definitely throws some flood light out as well.
B00TEEITFG|5|Perfection!  I'm so detail oriented and a designer by trade. I often braid cord. These handles are pure perfection!  Easy to install and perfectly crafted to fit and function. Well done!
B00ZN47Z0G|5|Great product! The towel soaks up water well and doesn't leave marks. I used the small one for the kitchen and the bigger one for washing cars and they both do a very good job overall.
B004L08GC4|4|Stickers were easy to peel off. Work as expected but bend too easily yet very difficult to straighten again
B00192KYMW|3|Kinda expensive for what you gets solid, clear, plain glasses. Photo gives the illusion they are textured. Very basic for $5 a glass
B00KZJQ2L2|5|This size was a perfect fit for my F-150 2000 Ford pick-up truck.  It's also of good quality.
B00C1YI2XA|1|Junk pure junk
B00CHOIPYU|4|Shipped quickly.  There was a slight size difference between these and the OEM that made installation a little harder than it should have been.  Once installed they seem to work well.
B00T36W12C|4|received as seen
B00T6JB74E|5|Just what I needed to keep the battery up on the bike.
B00HQLPP9C|5|What a great product this is. I love the size of the pad. The design and color are great as well. Everything is just great. I recommend this to anyone. 5 stars all the way!
B009Y7MJVS|4|The holder secures the older EZ Pass transponder as stated ... one minor issue, the windshield has the speckled &#34;black-out&#34; area at the top, behind the rearview mirror and, because of the texture, the suction cup will not secure to this area, which is the &#34;recommended&#34; location for the transponder (behind the mirror & driver's line-of-sight). However, I located the transponder/holder at the right edge of the black-out area and at the top of the windshield.  The unit is still unobtrusive from line-of-sight perspective and unit is still recognized at toll areas.  Can't speak to the &#34;indestructible&#34; quality yet but, overall, I like being able to switch the unit between vehicles without a fuss (or the &#34;stickers&#34;).
B0067UBPMO|5|It works great it helped me out in a tight spot
B00BFDH05Y|5|It fixed the ac in my 07 Honda civic.
B005O52SLU|5|Ordered for my 4 yr old Grand daughter. I used the measurement guide and it is perfect for her
B0009IQXAE|5|It works.
B00COOSE6M|5|I've bought OPT7 HID kits previously and have done so again.  Why?  Because they work and work well.  You can't get better quality for this price.
B0002JMEQW|5|This one connects directly to your air pressure source, rather than having to keep refilling and getting a one-second blast of air. Put a small amount of flush for lines. A bit more for the evaporator - you really shouldn't flush any other parts; especially the pump. Flush with the solvent. Then purge with air - done. This will take a while on the evaporator.
B00B9FDGHO|5|Thanks !! Fit perfect.fast shipping,good price ,thanks again ,yours Julio.
B0068FYRBY|4|Installed and it works as it should.  Only time will tell how long it last.  An other similar model I tried had a single center mounting post which only lasted a couple months before the light started flashing like a warning light.
B002UKYKIG|5|Repeat purchase.
B00WTIHS4M|5|Great product worked for the cost.
B00578QW70|5|Worked great!
B00MWEN5YA|5|Perfect product
B004K9ETMM|5|Great product at a great price
B00FXLJ8U4|5|bought several and gave out to friends and family especially guys at the Corvette Club that own C6 and C7 Corvettes.
B007ZHZ7EK|5|Bought this for a Nux cosplay (Mad Max Fury  Road) they are perfect.
B000ET5TC6|5|Using in C5 LS1 - works fine - hard to tell the life of the plugs but should last for over 30K miles.
B00FJ67UBW|5|Works great
B000C8PSWU|2|When it says &#34;REPLACEMENT CLUTCH KIT&#34; you would assume it means everything you need. I recently burnt my clutch out (needed a new flywheel) and didnt read into this enough and bought it solely on the price. It shouldnt say its an entire replacement kit unless it includes everything you need to replace the entire unit and all its contents. Good price though if its all youre looking for. Not even sure if it would have fit my car. Fast delivery though.
B009DJW6HE|5|The bumper was everything I expected. my car looks a whole lot better. The promise date for my bumper was 7 days and I got it in 3. Really pleased with this person.
B00C8747O8|5|as listed
B00RVUH5GE|5|Really like how it looks on my really like it and haven't had any problems with it yet.
B001DRHMRI|5|Much better quality than other brands and is OE spec, easy install and even comes with new drain plug crush washer and both O-rings for the filter itself.
B004RCPAFC|4|but I had to replace both the front panel and the controller board with this kit.  It worked first time, and got my fridge running, so I'm happy.
B0014COKYU|5|must have if you have to clean some heavy duty stuff
B00C91GCQY|5|Love it!! Received so many compliments on my Pretty N Pink Jeanne's Landscape Design truck license plate!! Love the bling.
B00BR1TKOS|5|Works great! Very bright, clear and easy to use.  It dos get a little heavy holding it up after awhile.
B00SHF5Z64|5|Good
B000XBCURW|5|If you want details, read other reviews to discover exactly why this product is worth the price. It solves a problem that Armorall and the others create.But if not...<br /><br />BUY IT!<br /><br />It does what the others don't do. No protector lasts forever but this does last longer than others without creating problems.
B0024E6QX0|5|We love this!!! Unfortunately we have a vent over our bed in our camper and when the sun comes up in the morning it shines down on us. This stays right in place in the vent!
B008FC516I|5|Great performing pump!  Perfect for the oomph your 8,000 to 15,000 gallon pool needs. No more green or cloudy pools---less than half the chemical costs after I switched to this pump. Why?  The sand filter does the cleaning--not the chemicals!  And the reason is the water is circulated often and fast enough to make a marked difference!  Very happy with this purchase!
B005WGR22Q|1|Not working on my New Beetle 2000. 2 liters<br />keeping reading code and freeze there.<br />returned.
B004GUI12Y|4|I own several of these Boulder 15s. I use six of them in a portable array when camping off the grid for extended periods of time.<br />I keep one connected via a GZ charge controller on a vehicle dashboard to the 12V battery. It keeps the seldom driven vehicle's battery topped off so no jumper cables are needed.<br />Two of my panels are the older version that only have one additional charge connection and the extra long cable. They required an additional adapter cable (4.7mm male to 8mm female) to connect the new panel. Otherwise, the older panels have had no problems, beyond some anodize fading, during their extended use.<br />The new version panels have a  short USB connection, a GZ proprietary cable connection and a chaining port. They also have a single blue LED indicator on the back for charging status.
B00G0PQR74|5|Toyota parts are the best period!
B000I04Z7Q|5|Looks tight! You will need a 12v connection
B00AVNN1V6|3|Clear coat was hard as rock when I went to use it. I guess I waited to long.
B00A3UNYW8|5|Works perfectly on my 2010 Chevy Avalanche.  Found instructions online, you have to hold this next to the tire sidewall rubber, not the stem for it to work.
B00N5MVB5I|5|Fit were old ones came off does dress up the wheel
B00KTIQDMW|5|Quick service, excellent product works as advertised
B005NDO8O8|4|Product does need improvement as the blower motor ran backwards causing very low output at the vents. I had to switch the wires in the connector to the blower motor and the problem was then solved. Also, the adaptor plate is way too weak. Otherwise it works okay.<br />Mike Graves ASE tech for 30+ years
B00QEDKGHE|5|worked great
B007V2BJE6|3|The good: The fit is perfect for Lexus RX350, and the shield is easy to fold flat. Installation and removal take seconds.Keeps the temperature in the car down.  The bad: Working surface is simply not reflective enough. It appears light gray, not metallic (I am referring to silver color, but I am sure it is not more reflective in golden and other options). As a result, on a sunny day the screen itself gets VERY hot (to the extent that makes it painful to remove from the windshield).  I tried highly reflective non-custom made accordion style shade from a retail store and it was almost cold under the similar conditions.  I will be looking for another brand of custom shades.
B00X6DDXPC|4|Good sunshade with a pretty design.  I wish it was a little larger but it doesn't leave much of my windshield showing.  I have noticed at least a 10 degrees difference in my car's interior when I use this.
B008P0LEPW|5|My husband is very happy with this part and the time it took to arrive!
B00J0G9B28|5|My ac finally works now!! After 2 years
B00BR1DR2Y|5|They fit perfectly and they keep my hands cool while i work
B004RBXZDC|5|My husband loves this decal, great for the music lover. Been holding up well.
B002PQQGPA|5|well made and fit great.
B009Y7MJVS|5|This unit has worked really well for me.  I bought it for times that I visit my family in the Northeastern US.  I have used it in several rental cars.  It mounts easily and can be removed easily.  It's very handy.  I highly recommend it.
B000C6KMAK|5|ON TIME&GOOD
B004UP64E2|5|Works great. Loaded my klr650 just fine. Was a little sketchy with a long ramp on my low truck, but worked great in the end. Oh yea I walked on it with the load of my bike and it felt sturdy - thats about 650lbs total.
B008MRTSB0|1|Didn't work. Not worth returning.
B000EPPF38|5|Perfect fix, high quality exhaust gasket.
B000C5DXLG|5|fits and works great 06 Mazda Tribute
B007Q7SYT4|2|I received the product without instructions, so I found them online, which is to say they consisted of four poorly taken pics accompanied by 4 brief paragraphs. not much help. (Drivers Side) they suggest undoing a &#34;U&#34; bolt retaining the hardware to re-use, then it asks you to attach the mount. I looked all over the tie rod end for the U bolt (I just replaced the entire steering and axle assembly with new Moog Parts) and thought maybe I missed something. took apart the steering center link and tried to make it fit. after about an hour I realized they were talking about the u bolt(s) that hold the axel on no where did it say, indicate, or show that. after install I realize the bolts designed to hold the shocks in place don't fit through the holes in bracket I just installed. they need a 5/8 hole and its slightly too small. that drill bit is about $40 at home depot. It seems like the entire kit is made from spare parts they used on other models. I have only had it on for a few days but we will see. Also I had no idea Sky jacker used parts made in Mexico, I though they were American made,
B00GI77DS6|1|Bought these at a local AutoZone store, expressly because it says &#34;CAN Bus, no error messages&#34;.  Well, they DO trigger bulb-out errors in my 2007 Audi A8.  I had a set of regular 7506 incandescent bulbs so that I could switch out easily, and of course the regular 7506's don't trigger the bulb-out alarm.<br /><br />Very disappointing, though it may just be my particular make / model of car.
B00HRHR3VI|5|We did have to mount it vertical instead of horizontal because of the thin store door frames, but it works great. It also keeps our 100 pound German Sheperd from pushing through and/or ruining the screen. I would recommend this product.
B0024E5XOS|5|It worked just as I had hoped. Product was intact and in good working order. Thank You!
B001DBBTO6|5|I got this for my husband!<br />He is a Chef and as you'd imagine he sweats a lot in a hot kitchen all day.<br />I got him this for grooming and sanitary purposes and he looks really nice in it (like a pirate chef lol) plus it does the work of a hair net and bandana all in one!<br />Recommended!
B000CMIG5M|5|This is one item where Amazon's fitment guide can be spotty... in my case, a Mercedes E320, SL320, and models with the M104 engine.<br /><br />There are at least 6 or 7 different belt sizes for the Mercedes M104 (and M103) engine, so it's important to know your engine serial number, belt driven accessories, and idler & tension pulley size/configuration.  I purchased this for a 1995 E320 and it was a perfect match.<br /><br />Best bet is to look at the belt currently installed on your vehicle and use it to identify the correct size and replacement.
B000N9PRKG|5|Came with pipe sealant already on it, it worked great, I had a leaky one, which started leaking due to a bad thermostat.<br />So if your valve is leaking occasionaly only when your hot water heater is running and hot you may want to replace the thermostats.<br />my heater had the original valve so when it popped open it didn't reseal well so I got a continuous drip.
B008J1E0OE|5|I have used the Bushtec Hitch and this one is cheaper in price and just as good. But if u have a Bushtec trailer I will recommend getting the Bushtec harness + isolator and hitch pin this one comes with the ball
B0013V6M7U|5|Great !!
B00QRHDIPY|5|works great for lots of applications
B008UY20BK|4|The grill is nice, only down side is there is what looks like a chip on one of the tabs where they had to hang it for the powder coating. It's not noticeable once installed, but there should still be a warning or something that says this so people don't contact the company about it thinking it's a defect. They say it's a &#34;manufacturing mark&#34;.
B00NUSUY0A|5|Holy crap this jacket is sweet! I'm 6 ft 210 with an average body (not buff in other words) and I bought a large. The fit is absolutely perfect, and the leather is surprisingly pliable for how thick it is. Extremely comfy and well trailered, worth every penny.
B001EOV492|4|arrived fast.  four star rating due to the fact that it does not fit the Traverse unless turned upside down which makes smaller trailers sit at to much of an angle so the rear of the trailer almost hits the ground.  If you get this to go on a Traverse you will need to get an extention so it does not hit the lisence plate and you dont have to turn it upside down.
B00Q7HV6NA|1|Did not for my truck its just a little too long. Nissan frontier 2010
B00Z2RCCE8|1|this item is junk!!!!  I guess you get what you pay for...I wanted to return it but there is a $7 return charge...not hardly worth the hassle,  so don't buy this item!!!  doesn't mount easy to my bike,  very hard to hook up.
B006TMNSMU|5|Works as advertised.
B000HYL20G|5|Great for tearing down these new mini electronics. No more lost micro screws.
B00M6FNDR4|5|Wonderful way to display to the world that I'm blessed!
B000182DPQ|5|thanks
B009FUF6DM|5|Great for dusting. And no matter how often I've washed, they still have that &#34;sticky/Velcro&#34; thing going. Best dusting cloth I've ever used. A little diamond here!<br />Got more!
B002NSS4C8|5|Perfect fit. Seller was ultra fast with shipping too.
B000GTVBSU|5|Works perfect.
B00GBVHQB8|5|These gloves are worth the money. I had these for more then a year and used them for everyday rides. You should buy this for the best grip and design gloves.
B003NU1ZM6|1|thought it was larger!
B008ECC31U|5|These were perfect, they slipped right in and look exactly like the stock ones.  I was sick of seeing the holes that were there, and these are a great, simple and cheap replacement.  If I happen to loose another, I will definitely be looking at these again.
B00M76FSH0|5|The Minion is adorable. He waves at me every morning!!! Wish I had bought 2 even though the instructions were detailed I still did not realize exactly what parts were to be left stuck. And getting the bubbles out only made it look worse. Next time I will know exactly what I am doing. NOT the SELLERS FAULT. I do better with picture instructions.
B00MN6LR6A|1|It's definitely not universal fit as it didn't fit my Saab.
B004DRSLEI|3|I have to make adjustments to the plastic mold to get it to fit. Too much plastic. Items are not a perfect fit. Makes car look new as for cosmetic.
B00FPR1SXG|1|Has no scent whatsoever . Even for the first day . Buy the cx instead .
B00KTHUR52|5|They are working! No problems getting cut & programed!
B00CFPF9RM|5|Easy to Install, and looks great on my 13' Green Boss!
B001DRHMMS|5|fits my car and works great
B00OPEFKBQ|5|nice look  on my Honda accord 2015 sport .<br />I recommended this. ^^
B00JQYOAVG|4|Easy to install and no problems encountered.
B00GRK06MO|4|Good light safety glasses. Nice dark tint good for summer months but not so dark you can't see. The only thing I didn't like was that the nose pads stick to your nose when you sweat, but they will not slide down it might be a good trade off.
B00G9AFQSQ|5|Exactly matches what is described.  They came, popped them in, and saved myself the time and energy of having to go to the dealership!  Will definitely look here for future purchases.
B000NPNXH4|5|It works as expected, I found  no time lag when the brake light switch was tripped at least that I could notice, I got lucky when I was able to fit the module and make all my wire contraction under the tail light assembly.
B004NBDLYE|5|REPLACED LEAKING ORIGINAL PERFECTLY.
B00C7M3G6Y|5|love the drop car rides nice 4hr install
B009G4Y9RG|5|Shipped on time plus the parts fit perfect.  Can't beat the price either!  Excellent!
B0002UEMZ2|1|Didn't keep inner tie rods tight like they should be.
B00BFPZ1OE|1|Got the wrong size. Box said XL but had a L inside. No removable neck cover either. Plus it had a big logo on the back which I don't want. Helmet I got wasn't the helmet I ordered.
B004PBAETC|5|Mudflaps are amazing but look even better i recommend them
B00K6D23DS|3|Nice but only top symbol or bottom symbol will light up at one time.
B00802GHPW|5|The light is bright and look very nice!
B0016IGZ18|5|Great products
B00JV04KEM|2|Very thin, mine has torn easily; if there are the 3 layers promised, they are not visible to the naked eye based on examinations I have done on the several holes that have appeared in this thing as soon as I threw it over my bike. It does say &#34;Rust O Leum&#34; on it.  It's better than nothing but in my opinion, it is not worth $90, more like $29.99. I regret this purchase and feel that I paid way too much for it.
B00C6MYSFI|2|Rebuilt my front shocks.  The original oem boot slotted into the upper housing. This does not and couldn't figure out how to make it so it just sits there loosely hopefully offering some protection.
B003D50KM2|5|This replacement valve is working great, instructions were easy to understand. Most of the work involved is just getting to the valve, the actually replacement is simple and straight forward. Highly recommend.
B001O01B7G|5|Much better than Aftermarket!
B0032HBXJ0|4|I like it!  It improved my gas mileage by 3 mph and keeps my bed nice and dry.  It was a little tough to get the slides to work (for an old guy) but once we were able to move them they worked fine.  Getting it aligned the first time was a little tricky.  But once it was set up properly it went on quickly.  The very cheap plastic handle of the slide closest to the tail gate broke the first time we went to refold the cover to haul some stuff.  Still it reattached easy enough once we were finished.  I would suggest Bestop use a rubberized replacement for the plastic pieces.  BTW, although not the speediest rebate center ... the $50.00 check did arrive during the last half of July.  The rebate makes the price even more attractive.
B000CINV88|5|it says Disc brake quiet and I haven't heard them squeak... so ummm... Although I will say, it seems as though after using this product, I notice everyone else's squeaky breaks lol.
B0052FRX9E|3|It was a good one too I do appreciate this product.
B00513G82U|4|my wife likes it , it is functional great for my lunch pail but I cant get it to stop ratteling  the seals fell apart already
B000EDUTN6|5|Received this item on the day predicted. Found out that it will not serve my purposes. I needed a check valve that would work on a hose bib connection. This one will  not work in that application. My fault for not checking more before ordering.
B000GQ6LF6|4|This product would have been an easy install if I purchase when I first bought the car. After three years, the bolt carriage holes in the frame developed rust and I couldn't tighten the bolts. My suggestion is to buy a 1/2 in wire brush, PB Blaster, and white lithium grease if you have car that is a few years old.<br /><br />Actual install will take 15 to 20 min. Easier if you have help from someone to help hold the hitch, but I used a car jack and had no problems.<br /><br />Cleaning out the rust will take an hour
B0068ETF4Y|5|This product is great especially with the addition of new exhaust and the Fi2000 tuner...
B002ZMBRSK|5|Installed; looks and works great!
B00KWEVZTE|5|perfect fit, factory replacement part.  Very quick shipment.
B00IJJP4XC|5|nice
B0002UQATS|5|great product
B000EDUTQ8|4|No more leaks
B00UW0HJQG|5|I have a new boat trailer that has a UFP A-60 coupler, which is square in shape and has a square coupler latch.  This lock seemed to be a better type to fit over my 3&#34; square coupler, and it secures with a padlock also.  I ordered it and was contacted by Karl of &#34;Hitch It Safe&#34;, who wanted to make sure I was ordering the correct size, as I had originally thought I should order the larger SL-2.  After conferring with him about the dimentions of my coupler and the locks, we determined that the SL-1 would be the better fit.  It was shipped fast and I attached it to my coupler and it fit like a glove with no slack or play.  It's very secure and should provide a good level of security against potential theft of my trailer.
B004QEQIN4|3|Window lock doesn't work - but I do not need that anyway. Couple of the lights on switches do not work. Otherwise, all windows and locks work great. Can not beat the price.
B000C847YU|5|Perfect fit. The adhesive back makes the install easier.
B00VSC6BDY|5|This is great value for money, it's light, flexible, serves the purpose nicely. The variety in size gave me the option to choose whats right for my car. Love it ! delivered on time, nice packing, though it's easy to install but he instructions are also useful. Highly recommended.
B00BISJC1G|5|Purchased for my husband. He uses it for car as well airplane trips for extra comfort. Compact size makes it good for travel.
B002X980JO|5|Exact fit. Quick shipping!
B001TK0DSY|4|I bought this one first as I wanted to clean and get some shine. This one does work against wax after a few washes so I bought Mr Pink for in-between waxes.
B000N321MO|5|Solid product
B001449I5E|5|Easy install and works great on my 2011 Traverse.
B0041G1C0Q|5|Sold my old Ridgeline and forgot to remove these. Exact replacement part and more than 50% less than what the dealer wanted.
B0002MG9TC|5|This is surprisingly sturdy and tough.  I have a large glass jar filled to the brim with ice water each night, and it does not budge.
B0010GHAIS|1|Did not fit my application as it said it would
B00PLXGJXI|5|arrived sooner then expected they look great
B00KOHHLTW|5|Ordered it on Friday and received it on Sunday. Yes I said Sunday and it was delivered via USPS, what??? Took me 15 minutes, if that long to install it. Took another 5 minuted to update firmware and upload a canned map for the Mufflers on my new FLHTK. Now it is set for AutoTune so I will ride a full tank of gas assuggested and see what happens. The canned map already seems to be working well though.
B000182DII|5|High power output
B00UAEHNYM|3|Seems like a solid product! Didnt work for me because of fitment.
B00PRY7DKO|1|Not what I thought but its ok.
B000C57W7C|5|These tie rods are dynamite.  Way better than factory, comes with loc-tite and the adjustment nut.  Buy these tie rods for sure!
B00V5B3PT6|5|Love it, it addes a very unique touch
B0041RU1PC|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT
B0048YHDAE|5|Worth chancing saved $ 200 bolted up perfect
B00JRE6APE|5|Exactly as advertised.  Is heavy, but works great.
B003E0UUAS|1|first set the highside gauge stopped working replacement set was sent 3 months later highside and lowside not reading pressures at all<br />would not recommend buying this product High failure rate
B000VT44HK|5|easy to install (no drilling) and looks great
B000CO86BY|5|Come on, people, a Cadillac Escalade weighs 5,573 lbs. A ton is 2000 lb. That means you could support your whole entire Slade with one jack, if you could get it to balance right (-:. What bothers me is what does &#34;Warning, bend tab after inserting ratchet&#34; mean, which is written on the side of the jack.  I can't find anything else about it. Bend it in? Bend it out? Anybody know?
B001AWLTX4|5|Great deal.  I rode from San Diego CA to San Antonio TX with this thing catching bugs the size of a VW Bug, it did not disappoint.  I recommend this product, I don't recommend riding from San Diego to San Antonio in two days on a motorcycle. ;)
B00BVV4Y2M|4|Does not come with tinted shield as pictured. Air vents are very small and don't allow for maximum airflow. Fit was a little snug for my taste, I wish I would have gotten a larger size to accommodate headphones, sunglasses, or a Bluetooth.<br />Overall it is quiet while riding and the field of vision is great!!! I like the quick release buckle and the removable chin bar makes it very versatile.
B00BDEP5ZM|5|Excellent product.  Eliminates odors in our camper from the holding tanks..  Will continue to use this product as long as we have our camper.  Our kids use it in their camper as well.
B00EWO2AV2|5|I'm very satisfied with the product and expect to do more business with you in the future
B000JL760C|1|Ordered twice and twice came leaking. Punctured bottles absorb the humidity which defies the purpose for racing fluid.
B00979NOWQ|5|Great Gloves, good shipping
B008D6YGE4|4|Very flimsy, yet made a 1200 mile journey. I'm proud of the cheap rack, thinking about buying another for my other bike.
B00EELM7PM|5|Everything description said
B0055AZD52|5|Very easy to install. Thank you.
B00LL6PK2K|4|Thoughts on this particular tire gauge after a couple of months of ownership.<br />1. It appears to be accurate as I checked it against two other mechanical gauges.<br />2. Although it is very light which initially made me think it was low quality the case seems to be holding up. It is a two part plastic mold held together with two small eyeglass type screws. The activation button continues to have a positive click<br />3. The blue LED is easy to read and does come in handy during low light situations.<br />4. The angle of the head makes taking measurements tricky in some instances; e.g. my motorcyle<br />5. I've opted to leave this gauge at home to use on my vehicles, motorcycle and bicycle. I'll continue to carry a mechanical in each of my vehicles.<br />6. There are two other brands on Amazon that appear to be in exactly the same case, but run $3-5 cheaper. I'd have a hard time believe they are any different.<br />7. Unable to locate country of manufacture on product or packaging.<br />8. Product received is representative of picture and description on Amazon.
B00FWY9V6S|5|It was exactly what I was expecting it to be!! AWESOME!!!!!!
B000GKD5NI|1|Falls off ALL THE TIME! Sad.
B000KYZR8G|5|I had a missing button on another one of these so this was a nice replacement
B00R1MXL0Q|5|Fit perfect. installed in about 10 minutes
B007V2CS82|5|Yeah, finally one that fits my Acura RDX tight  and does the job. These things really help. Be careful - the sunny side gets really hot.
B00SL2STX4|3|I think for light duties only . It not for 500 LBS like they said .
B00I6VTUWY|5|It feels heavy enough to break a car window and it fits in the hand nicely. The section to cut a seat belt is on the opposite end and seems to be easy to use. I put the Hammer Breaker in compartment between the front car seats for fast access if needed.
B00J2BNFZU|5|Very pleased with this product.
B00P9OF04I|5|I was a little skeptical, but this kit works very well and very quickly.  It's almost shocking how much better your headlights will look.<br /><br />Don't know if the heavy duty kit -- which has more stages -- yields a better result, but it can't be THAT much better.  Regardless, in terms of outcome for effort, this is great.<br /><br />One note: the vapor from the stage 2 spray smells like the kind of thing you do NOT want to be inhaling.  Make sure you're outside when you do this...<br /><br />Recommended.
B007TY4IGM|5|Fit great on my 2003 Safari rear &#34;dutch door&#34;.  Took just a few minutes to install.
B000CAINEI|4|I've bought three of these at separate times.  I used one as insulation liner for inside wall of RV food pantry. It often gets too warm when in direct sunlight.  To ensure sunblock on the outside of trailer same wall I plan to hang the second one temporarily each day over that area see if that keeps pantry goods at lower temp.<br />I used paper made a quick pattern of walls the trimmed my visors to fit - used 3M tape strips to secure.
B000CITTW0|5|looks good works good
B0052XE26I|3|1 shade lighter blue and slightly loose, must use sticky tape or something.
B00KTHZVFI|3|Material is definitely different.  It is lighter than the original key.  The emergency key also will not stay in.  I do not see myself using it so I will probably glue it in.  While I saved 100 dollars (30 vs 130 (dealership)) I do not think I would buy this one again.
B00OMQB6TM|5|Beautiful tag and the intials were done beautiful.
B0007LZK9S|5|Fits well, no complaint.
B000CGHTC4|4|Was used for a rear sensor replacement. I used this as a match to the original existing front sensor that had no rust damage.  It worked without issue to the ODBII computer.  Often when changing sensors with matching others they conflict with the ODBII system because baselines are different. This functioned as a OEM match.  Allowing you to replace the damaged part and not worry about causing a conflict between the two.
B000C9NXOO|5|Perfect replacement on our Duramax. identical to OEM right down to the pulley.
B009PBWQ2K|5|just what i needed.
B00AZS8PMM|5|Expensive but worth it. Well built and designed. The perfect solution for installation of a 32&#34; Flat screen TV in an existing AV cabinet in the fifth wheel.
B00GXC2WAK|5|They're really bright and look so sweet in my 2011 Volkswagen Jetta SEL
B0065R58AE|4|fits good not great , can get very hot in hot days but reduced the amount of sweat running out of the gloves
B00C7YUMQ4|5|Excellent for the steering box in my 55 Chevy.
B001QUDVWW|5|02 Tahoe ..perfect fit. You will have to swap the float switch which may take a few minutes to negotiate out of the original tank, but finally cooperated. Original pumps fit perfect and all working again ..10 year after my original battery leak took out my tubing and wiper tank. Happy again, highly recommend.
B001HY6EIA|5|Quality plug for my 2008 Lincoln Navigator. Runs very smooth.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|If you need fuses... what is better than a box with 120 fuses...?<br /><br />They seem well made and I have no reason to consider them &#34;cheaper&#34; quality than anything you would get from walmart, ace, frys, etc. I am happy and feel they are WAY worth the money when compared to standard retail prices.
B0002NIF70|5|Its great
B00OIQMZR8|5|great filter looks way better in person
B0031ZDU62|5|These arrived very quickly, packaged well, and were exactly what I needed. You really can't go wrong with this price, the coils are exactly like the ones you would buy at a Ford dealership or an auto parts store without the inflated ridiculous price. If you have a Ford or Lincoln with the 5.4 and need to replace one or two coils, I would personally suggest that you go ahead and buy this whole set because you can't buy even one coil at a dealership or parts store for this price. It never hurts to have a few spares just in case and if you have time when changing the bad ones in your vehicle, you may as well replace all 8 of them at the same time. If you have never replaced coils in 5.4 it is not a fun job in the least...it is dirty and hot work with very little room for your hands, especially cylinders 3, 4, 7 and 8 so plan on a job that will take a while and always use extreme care to not break off or over tighten any of the plugs because that leads to disaster. The coils just basically snap down onto each plug and each has its own plug. I definitely recommend this deal to anyone reading this review, you will not be disappointed!
B0022ZIV1G|5|Fast shipping.. i personally had to modify my fork to hold these ...but i ordered them knowing this,so im very happy.
B00I0H27EW|5|This set is amazing for the price, was easy to put on ( patience and determination helps) and is comfortable. Reminds me of the Burberry pattern :) 
B00DLMNCEU|5|Worked perfectly for me. I was initially a little worried about the flimsiness of the connectors, but they held up well and I haven't had issues. Took all of 15 minutes to install. The 4300K color was closer to 6000K in my opinion, but not a real deal breaker. I've been running them for a couple of weeks now and have not had any outages or problems that other users have reported.
B00DEJTGVI|5|Good quality and easy to install.  Looks great.
B004I6HOQA|5|I've owned two other helmet speakers and these are the best so far.  To all the riders that complain about volume take note that you need an amplifier with all helmet speakers!  I made these wireless with the addition of a small amplifier and bluetooth adapter to my helmet.  Using only velcro it made a good setup with clear sound.
B0090Q59PG|4|A friend has had a similar product in her car for a couple of years. Every time we rode together I would tell myself to check into getting one but of course I'd forget until I had to put up the pop up type sun shade I had in my car. After a particularly trying day I went out to my car and had to fight with the sun shade to put it away and decided that was it. I immediately got on Amazon and found this version (the one my friend has is two pieces that meet in the middle). As soon as I received it I installed it which was pretty simple. The directions say you should, when pulling it open to use,  pull it in front of the rear view mirror so as not to damage it. I tried this but it seemed to pull it nearly out of shape and, in that position, it would let in too much sunlight anyway. Pulling it behind the rear view mirror works fine and hasn't caused any damage but I am careful not to yank it over. The best part is that there's no storage issue. It's not bulky or awkward and doesn't interfere with your field of vision because of it's compact size.
B00LOW2FJM|5|great fit !
B002KH994O|5|Excelente!
B0061OR9V2|3|This adapter will not work on a 2015 HD Ultra Limited. Harley has changed the wiring to a 4 wires at the headlight. So this adapter is not &#34;Plug and Play&#34; for a 15 ultra .
B00GBBE0L2|5|Bought for my 2015 SR5.<br />These racks arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  They did not come with written instructions, however, yet I found them easily on the internet.  The trickiest part is getting the caps off to start the installation.  They say to use the &#34;nylon removal tool&#34; that isn't included.  I carefully used the edge of a plastic ice scraper to get under and release the tabs.  Once the caps are off, the rest goes on smoothly.<br />Once tightened, these are very sturdy and look good.  Quality is high- what you'd expect for an official Toyota accessory.  These were bought to facilitate the use of kayak J racks, and they claim a weight rating of 130+ pounds - perfect for my intended use.
B008XB9BJY|5|Very pleasant, warm color of light, much like an incandescent. Lumen output is likewise on par with a traditional bulb while using much less energy.
B00MU2NY6S|5|Absolutely amazing lights double the performance of the standard HID lights that I had before and you can see double the distance. Cannot recommend these enough.
B001Y8XK5O|5|Delivered on time and was as expected
B00029WYVW|4|thanks
B007G7YPQK|5|Arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I painted these drums with a silver paint designed for that application, looks great when viewed through my aftermarket rims. Fits perfectly to my 2006 Kia Spectra 5, rear drums. Thank You
B004FSEJZA|5|Very helpful for a quick clean up when you don't have time for a full wash. Does what it's supposed to do and I love it!
B004WH1LMS|5|My wife got me this for Christmas.  I use it all the time.  I wish it had some of the trails pre-loaded, but that wouldn't help in all cases.  I like the fact that I can plan routes on my PC and upload them to this unit and then download the ride back.  For the cost, it is feature rich and I only use about 1/2 of them.  One note: The engine temp equipment does NOT work with the 2012 Brute Force models...however my wife knew that before purchase.
B000BPZ4UU|4|The clamps were a bit difficult to install I. The end piece with these hose in the sleeve. Otherwise they look great once installed.
B00M34CS7E|5|quick shipping.. right part!
B000YCAM70|5|Perfect fit!!
B00OWHD8YW|5|adorable
B000MWU466|4|Nice seat, a definite step up from the factory OEM seat. Easy to install.
B00FADDOL4|3|First one I received was DOA. The second one worked okay, but a bit of a pain to &#34;program&#34;.<br />Ended up ordering a different one that was simpler to install and was already programmed.
B00CDJ8RLU|5|Second one I ordered nice.
B00TQ7UV66|1|Some weak spots in it and also way over priced for what it is and what you get
B00FZQ1JDQ|4|easy install works fine
B004I0N5V4|5|as advertised.
B0058TF7EM|5|No problems with the net, we used straps also and used the net over top to secure our load. No clips have broken like others have stated.
B00KYDA2GA|1|I bought this light bar for my boyfriend and it's been on his truck for a whole week and one section of the lights don't work already. I paid $50 for something that barely lasted me a week, I'm hoping I can have another one shipped to me because that's bull crap. I'm disappointed.
B006B80JSS|5|This dropped right in, and was easy to install. It was everything that I expected from a K&N filter, and I will continue to use them in all of my vehicles.
B008P5YHBU|5|.Very good<br />  Thanks
B00EJA9ZKI|4|The finish fades to a bronze color after a month or two but over all very happy with them.
B00IJ0E702|5|Great. Keeps my blood pressure down as I teach my daughter to drive. Easy to,read and very noticeable.
B00171ZHY0|1|Too much plastic on these bars and this makes them look like a cheap set. For the money they want for them I really dont see the quality to match it. Im so glad I found a set at my local parts store to look at first before wasting my own money sending them back, as I surely would have sent them back.  The plastic end caps are cheap looking imo & it makes them look low quality. Anyone who thinks they want these I strongly suggest you first try looking at them in person if you are able to as there are much better bars for this price or even cheaper, just look around.
B0031XMOBQ|5|Just what we needed to get our RV fridge going.
B0016C3STQ|5|good deal works great on our 2013 nissan pathfinder
B00JGAVEUK|1|Wasn't for 91-94 . Didn't fit
B00IK2MNZK|5|Worked just as it should, like new
B0060YPS66|5|Excellent brake pads. Very good quality. Quiet, and stop the car well!
B008DETNBW|4|Lowers the car nice, but I definitely don't recommend lowering the car if you're worried about warranty, it has a bigger effect on the car then just the &#34;suspension&#34; you can damage the underbody and what not. I'm having some problems with hyundai now, but if you do decide to lower the car. I recommend coil overs, or the Eibach springs, and some Yellow Konis. Also, make sure your wheels don't poke lol.
B00X6DEV7Q|4|Beautiful SunShade that matches my tan Malibu perfectly.  It helps me pick out my car in the sea of cars at work and it decreases the inside temp in the dessert of Florida parking lots.
B000CJG06C|4|Good part. Solid. Doesn't say it's for the Coupe and Hatchback. Will fit the sedan but not preperly. Leaves large gaps. It's a different shape.
B004BYX8W8|5|thanks
B000C0UMX8|5|Perfect fit for my jeep yj
B000KKLLFS|5|Good product. Fest delivery. Recommend.
B0097TA2F8|5|great product
B003Z304NM|5|great experience
B0055LNQ3W|5|Expensive but worth it.
B007JSGR9Y|2|Used the scanner a couple times then went to clear a code off my tahoe and the code reader went black and every light on my instrument cluster.
B00BAZC1SS|5|fits great works great
B006E880RC|4|The dealer does need to reprogram the vehicle's computer, and the instructions lacked any detail (but had a picture!).  Since having a properly programed computer is a safety issue, thus needed to be done regardless even if I wired is successfully, I had my local dealership install.  Overall I'm happy.  I bought the vehicle last year (certified pre-owned) and the the towing package they offered to put on at the time of sale was $150 more than what I did by buying it here and taking it to them to install.  The peace of mind it's installed by VW technicians was worth the $190 to install since I'm driving around a baby as well. :)  The hitch itself is easy peasy and I definitely could have done that myself, but I'll review that separately.
B00BFE3EU8|5|The part was a perfect fit. Worth the extra cost for prime.
B00NHBYOA6|5|Worked perfect on our first trip with it!
B0007M1ZGE|4|Very well made.  Amazon - I am not Victoria Carr!!! Amazon made a mistake!! The review is from Cindy Kaufmann - the one who made the purchase and wrote the review!!
B009PIJ96Y|5|fits right. ok
B00PG9I8IQ|2|They were missing the top of one & the bottom of the other- cut right off.
B000CIXZPC|3|Heavy duty polished aluminum . Good quality .<br />Con: it's curved- doesn't fit wheel opening properly. Needs to be flat. Material is too thick to bend when screwed to wheel well!
B000NUBP7Y|5|excellent product
B000BZXR6I|5|Installed last night on my 2004 Subaru Forester NA. Fit like a charm. Great stopping power and smooth braking. No noticeable fade, within reason.
B00JMVC67I|1|Dont buy i only received 3 pieces
B00KTHZ64O|5|I have an 05 Dodge Dakota.  This item saved me over $100 dollars from buying a replacement from the dealer.  The key part is a bit thicker than the stock key, but the new key works just as well.
B000C1JVBQ|5|Worked great on my 1972 CJ5.
B0082365AQ|1|Horrible! Collapses in itself while in-route to the ramp. Returning it for a more durable, self-locking (although more expensive cart), but this one simply is not intended for anything larger than a child-size kayak.
B00NR249R8|5|Spoiler came earlier than expected, removed from shipping box, installed in minutes, right color looks great on cars, your the best.  I know whwere to go when I buy another car and need a spoiler.  Great product and GREAT price.  Many Thanks
B0044AZ4BC|5|Delivered on time, in good condition, & as described--thanks!
B008UVH6QW|1|As this is a generic part it's pretty hit and miss trying to sort out the wiring as there's no wiring diagram. I'm not confident that it's ok. Online feedback is not very good with stories of burnt out bikes, so I'm not rating it well.
B000C6OJLS|4|good
B007J8IKFI|5|Small, stylish and easy replacement.
B00PRACZR4|5|Worked perfectly as needed.  Would buy again without hesitation.
B002QEDWBW|5|Works great on my 01 Malibu. If you are having problems with the flashers and hazard light this might fix it like it did for my car. Better than oem.
B001LNRRM4|5|these are for my 275 gallon trailer mounted smoker they fit well and look good
B010PD9NRM|5|I wired these correctly and doubled checked voltage and everything. They do not work. I will be returning these. They were exactly what my wife wanted, very disappointed.<br /><br />Correction!! I apologize I was incorrect. What ended up happening was you actually have to wire these backwards because the campers are generally A/C. My camper had black and white wiring and the new lights come with black and white wires. Wiring them white to white and black to black they will not work. Once you cross the wires they work great. Now we are really happy with these, I will probably order more to complete all light fixture changes in my camper.
B000S2QM9I|5|Easy to install fits perfectly and was $50 less than the dealer was trying to charge me.
B00S730DJ0|2|Horrible.  I bought it to remove some vinyl from a car.  You had to spray it on and quickly remove it.  If you did not remove it very quickly, it would seem to harden making it even more difficult to remove.  I found out it is easier to use a heat gun or torch which if done properly works fine.
B003V0GG18|5|Why not you need a trash bag this one doesn't look as tackey
B0045XRK06|5|I love the bight lighting it gives off.
B000MTI15K|4|works good
B00029JK2I|5|perfect flexibility and length for my 61 chevy
B006TJC3QU|5|Nicely done license plate holders! Love it!
B00RWLNDRC|2|This product is super cool and bright. But my truck has only been through the car wash and it has water in the lens. Is this just a fluke????
B00FQSFM18|5|I love this..I have it in my van and I put my purse there instead of on the floor it is especially great when you have a passenger you don't have to struggle with my purse on the floor or in front of console ..very handy on our month long road trip
B000EBKG90|5|Works well with my RV.  Could be larger, but for the price, this was the largest I could find.
B00JL8099Y|5|nice fit just what I was looking for
B008VLVDII|5|excellent
B001ECULXY|3|The quick strut is nice because it includes a new spring, along with the strut, so you can update/upgrade both in one shot.  I think they ride well, but am disappointed at how much noise they make in cool/cold weather.  They squeak, which is incredibly annoying for a brand new strut.  I googled the cause and how to mitigate it, but haven't had any luck making the noise go away.
B00HJR6F3I|4|Fits perfectly well into the 2012 A4.
B0002JMF9I|5|good deal
B00GD8CMDQ|5|Thanks so much
B00KX8G15M|2|[[VIDEOID:fada1df71aa2c3f6afba6eebe99628db]] Fairly easy install, but there is a problem with the harness I installed and I am waiting for email from the manufacturer and Yates. I installed and it works, but when I turn the right turn signal on , the right turn signals and right outside tail light sequence with the left inside tail light and vice versa. We checked install and it is correct but it appears the inside bulb sockets are put on the harness wrong or something?<br /><br />Instead of R1 R2 r3 r4 sequence , it is L1, R2 R3 R4! if that makes sense<br /><br />Since I have a 2013 challenger, I had to do the wire to the trunk latch so I can't just take it out and put the old lights back in.
B0058V9CF0|5|installed in minutes greatbuy
B00BITHPXM|4|great
B00CTTN160|5|Packaging was great as well as the tailgate!!
B00KGGTF9U|5|It is a good . it covered all my windshield like other circle shape covers
B008KZK1JW|5|Heavy duty rubber mats.  Fit my Hyundai Elantra Touring 2011 perfectly.
B00I2I104C|5|This is an excellent kit, works very well for my jeep. Makes the inside look completely different.
B00MCZ1EKQ|5|My order was shipped immediately and it was just what my son needed.
B005Y38S3E|5|Absolutely amazing product! Used it to paint my fogs and marker lights and I couldn't be more pleased...it goes on even, is perfectly transparent, has a great color and is very, VERY easy to use. Would DEFINETLY buy again
B000BWCERY|4|Okay
B0013LDKPC|5|Great price for a good product.
B0009T6EA2|5|As described, shipped quickly.
B008Y2D0RG|5|Very easy install on Ninja 650. I just had to cut a hole at the end of the grips to fit it over and put the bar ends on. Feel way better than stock, shipping was fast.
B00GST3L4E|4|Good value for the price. I changed-out the casters; they were too small and did not allow for easy movement of the dolly. I also, when changing the casters, replaced two of them with lockable casters. You either need to do that, or you need to chock the wheels when mounting your scoot to the dolly.<br /><br />Would have been nice if there was a &#34;ramp&#34; built into the dolly to make it easier to mount the bike.<br /><br />I'm being picky; the dolly works as advertised; and, again, it is a good value for the money. There are a number of other dolly's on the market for a LOT more money...<br /><br />Bob
B00NAQP7VI|1|It's junk. Condensation behind the protective glass cover after a week of very light use. Total use time was about 10 minutes. No mudding or water play was done.
B00R2CDVIW|5|good stuff
B00ZKQ8BJQ|5|Great!
B00N463A2W|5|our way of showing respect to the fellow officers that have given the ultimate sacrifice
B00NO5CTKC|4|Looks great!
B00JEXODKW|5|Great item. Very bright. Moves traffic with no problem
B00M8C5R92|3|Good quality components could be better with a little more pre fab & wiring. Basically its a kit that you have to assemble. Metal boxes are unpainted and have &#62;1&#34; hole on side for wires to run through or allow water in. Had to drill holes in box for mounting and a couple on bottom for drains.
B00O9H02O4|5|So far I LOVETHEM... they are perfect for me and look great on my new FZ07..The stock levers hurt my hands, but these, these are perfect.. thank you
B00A8MZ7IA|5|As ordered, great towels for the price
B001INN62M|5|Excellent quality and easy to apply.  Looks very nice on our gold colored car.  I can't speak to durability yet as it's only been on the car for two months so far.  Fingers crossed that it will hold up.
B00GUPIFS8|5|Come very happy to provide the best ones I seen
B000C9B5EE|5|This took care of the problem was here fast and seems to be built just as the oem one super easy to install and if you do install upper mount make sure you loosen the bottom dog bone  mount so it fits right
B009Z1PCQM|5|It's perfect!
B004BCHJMU|5|The headlights showed up as promised. And yes it comes as a pair both left and right. The headlight housings were wrapped in plastic and were in two separate boxes clearly marked R and L. I installed both sides and a couple of hours. The hard part was taking the bumper cover off. I would recommend getting the plastic clips to reinstall the cover. Once removed the plastic clips are ruined. Also I found that there were several plastic clips that were missing to begin with. I would order from this company again
B000C5S90G|5|god
B00RW4JAZ8|1|I was really disappointed, the product was cracked in 2-different places when I received them, they were really thin and fragile and did not fit right, I threw them in the trash. The biggest waste of $30.00. I rate this product as a zero.
B011M8WAYC|1|This is a cheap attempt to be first to market on the new R3 frame sliders.  It's garbage.  The seller lost all credibility by even selling it.
B000TYL8OO|5|Excellent. Looks great and creates a nice pocket.
B0024NSVO8|5|Great product!
B007CJ7KD2|3|proper fit for my car, but had poor quality of welds around fitting, should have been shipped in box to prevent some dents that were in muffler
B009MC124K|3|good product
B000EBKG5E|4|Provides nice back support.
B00843V9G4|3|Mushroom head big time but it's cheap and serves the purpose.
B004DRWIF6|5|looks like a new car again!
B00GJLYMW6|4|Item was as it was described. It is made very sturdy. It will not work on mens  bikes, with three top  cross bars. I could not use it. The manufacture needs to tell the consumer that it will not work on all bikes.
B00C6BX1JI|5|Worked great!
B001AT1F6S|4|I was hoping this was a smaller version of what I already have.  since it's not I gave it to my son as the freakin'  thing is not cheap.  gave another one to my brother he likes it.  personally I'm looking for one about 3 inches long with equal brightness which my wife bought for me years ago at TJ Maxx.  for 10 bucks
B00IJWQJ1U|5|My husband said this is exactly what he expected. Not too loud to annoy the neighbours. Not too quiet so other people won't heard him coming.He is very happy with the product.
B001F0IELG|5|Perfect solution to &#34;squeeze&#34; my 17' boat in the garage. Well made, heavy duty construction.
B002T75A0M|1|Did not fit and was poorly made.
B00WM36XNG|5|I used this to carry snacks in the car for our trip to the drive in and then when it was emptied I used it for the trash. It's very sturdy and well built and holds snugly to the back of a seat and also sits flat on the floor boards too. I am very happy with this product and it stays in my car for all my trips long or short. Very happy I got this for review I would gladly buy another
B000E2CVI8|5|Perfect fit, quality filter, fast shipping.
B00SKK4EXG|5|Excelent....
B00IWO4K8O|1|It would not fit the coupling
B004ROOXK8|5|Look very good and  rich, what an addition  to my vehicle
B000C9L22E|5|Fit my 2009 and 2011 suburban and yukon perfect.  Lower radiator hose.  Was shorter than the original the truxks came with but fine.
B008427D88|5|as advertised.
B00GUF74HQ|5|Easy install. Works as advertised
B00HOPC9AS|5|Exactly what I expected
B00R8QGITG|3|It took one tire from 35 psi to 45 psi in the time I connected my other pump to the battery and toped off the other three tires from 35 to 50. Then I used it to finish the job this one started. Probably good for a bike tire or basketball but not much else. The battery though gets 5 stars.
B000BLNTME|5|Basic is Best. Installed these in a beater with 250,000 miles. That's how long the original Sylvanias ran, still had the manufacture date on to verify. These are high beam bulbs and on this car they are connected in series when in DRL (daytime running) mode, and get full voltage in high beam mode. These new replacement Sylvania 9005 basics work great also and hope they are good for the next 250k or bust. You can certainly find bulbs with a higher price tag, but I doubt they will be any better.
B0055AYUEW|5|Fast shipping,  I will buy this brand again,  good price too
B00NSGCVWI|5|works as specified.  great deal. thanks.
B000B66UU2|5|Just like it was from the factory. Fit and function. Great price
B00D9C2CDO|5|This was so easy to pack and had all the room we need for the extras. Ran through a very heavy downpour in Florida and everything stayed perfectly dry. We double tied the straps and they did a superb job in holding it in place. No shifting, no rattles, no noise. Couldn't tell it was there. Had several people ask us what brand it was, where we got it and did we like it. Couldn't say enough good things about it.
B00CXYVKKA|5|Gets lots of laughs, and more importantly, the sticker has held up great.  I don't remember how long I've had it, but it isn't peeling, decaying or staining at all.
B00WQXRYLM|1|Dont buy it will not fit ur BMW X4 2014-2015<br />Its to big
B0066PI154|5|Great price, works awesome.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat if it's something you plan to only use in your garage.
B00766HVYE|5|Love it
B004GCNKDC|4|The fit isn't quite perfect, but it looks and functions fine once all the fasteners are in.<br /><br />It's flexible that it ships rolled up.<br />When installed, some of the fasters are holding the shape in addition to addressing gravity.<br />(It is possible that it has reformed to its installed shape now that it has been in place for a while.)
B0041CDORE|5|Install was very easy.  And the bikes performance was everything I was hoping for.  Throttle response  And acceleration  Significantly improved
B0029XJVA6|5|These windshield Wonders work very well  — they do a great job.
B001LHVOVK|5|Tire of not knowing why is the engine light coming on? I was and did not want to drive to Auto Zone to find out.  It gives you the code and you look for it on the web.  You will now speak smartly when talking to the mechanic.
B00OPXT1N0|4|Solid, did the job.
B008G38EK6|5|Arrived on time and fit great.  Was an easy install.
B00480J4PU|3|I saw this and i was blown away by the idea but as it turns out this bulbs DOES NOT work as advertised. I bought H7 ones from Amazon and i installed it very easily this afternoon and i was so excited to try them in the dark, when i did it was just a very bright yellow bulb. Its not bad by any means but it just doesnt look like xenon at all if you have a 3000k old bulb i highly recommend this for you because it will be a very satisfying upgrade but my bulbs are new and already have that 3800k look so this is not worth the money for me. Note: its not that bad it looks cool but its not that white that i was looking for. If you're like me try the Dimond ones from Philips they say its 5000k
B0042Z0E6E|4|We have used this a few times now and like it a lot. Nice touch having the carrying bag with it. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the weave could be a bit tighter. I'm hoping it lasts.
B00AUIJG0W|5|Works as described on my vinyl matte graphics on my truck.
B003RX0YCG|5|Great
B0049PNTFK|1|It didn't work they send me the wrong part
B00DSD5FT2|5|Had problem with the first sticker, contacted supplier via Amazon and within days rec'd a replacement.  It looks great.
B005DUN42I|5|Easy to install. Stays in place even with hard riding. Hasn't loosened or moved at all. I was worried that the aggressive grip might cause blisters, but not at all. Very comfortable with great control. I ride on rock infested trials and have been in rain, mud, dry dust and snow. Hands stay in control with no slipping. I also like the fact that I can take these grips off and put on heated grips for winter riding if I choose to. Another company out there makes lock on grips that are heated. The only down side to ODI grip is it's size. I purchased the shorter of the 2 lengths and it was still a very tight fit with the bars I have on my quad. I think that has more to do with the size of my stock hand guards though. I had the grips on for about 8-10 months, 1000 miles, and they show very little wear at all. So if you're looking for a great grip that's easy the install and remove, this is it.
B00WJUJRHG|1|BE WARNED - These are the worst of the worst as the hoses and connections are very cheap and both the low side and high side leak straight out of the packaging box. I should have returned these right away but chose to not lose more money in return shipping costs, opting instead of swapping old hoses and throwing these new pieces of junk in the trash can. If it were possible to give this rating a no star I would have but had to give it at least one star to write this review.
B003UNB4ZE|5|Perfect fit install was ten seconds
B00WH24LEU|5|Good for the price and quality is good
B0026JK8FK|5|Just bought a 2003 Acura CL type s w 6speed manual transmission. It was grinding when shifting into second if you shifted quickly. I bought this fluid and the instant change was AMAZING! I was sure the 2nd gear synchro was bad but it's fine now. I highly recommend this product!!
B000OCH4YO|5|aaa
B000Q754E4|5|Absolutely love this cooler! I have a small Coleman 12V that I have used for years. This one is much larger and super roomy!
B00MWQ7ZO4|4|Gr8 looking item..seems to be well manufactured....
B002MOED5U|5|ok I guess.
B00826PSQ0|5|Love these.  So much easier than trying to tell by looking if the tire is low. Wish I'd bought these sooner.
B00QFY2BCK|1|When I used it looks good but in next day my car headlights came back to yellow
B004UTD0RW|5|Looks really cool, doesn't block any important info, easy to install thanks
B005HWTGQU|5|easy and cheap
B002GZ6V3W|4|Not as purple as I wanted.  But the quality is excellent!!
B00IMPEWHM|4|Worked perfect for 97 Chevy. I'll have to see how they hold up.
B002N5W8Q4|5|This little fan really circulates the air in the refrigerator.
B00QGJGP5I|4|I have several of these hhoks in both of our vehicles. I hang bags of groceries, jackets, and umbrellas on them.
B010EUNSK4|5|[[VIDEOID:940ad1c868c9336e06b8c737cdaa5945]] This car jump starter was able to start my 1994 4.0L V6 Jeep Grand Cherokee without being hooked up to the car battery.  Take a look at the video where I demonstrate this as well as go over the features that this product has.<br /><br />Excellent product and I would recommend everyone to have this in their car in case of an emergency!
B000VB3NR0|1|Did not fit as expected. Returned July 13th and still haven't received my refund!!
B009YYVSZO|3|package was falling apart
B00IEAJA4U|5|2008 Toyota Tacoma.<br /><br />Thanks
B008FSQ13O|1|This is NOT by Mopar. We put it on our black Jeep Wrangler and the foam behind the black letters is WHITE. The letters are the wrong size and it looks awful. I would not buy this again. I'm going straight to Mopar for the REAL deal. Don't waste your time.
B00KVWQHD6|5|Great lights, the look awesome in my car.  They are very bright and a true white.  They slipped in just like OEM lights, and they worked right out of the box.
B008N8IMLA|5|1st class
B0016GVEI4|5|PERFECT!!! That's all I have to say
B005DKIIJW|5|This is by far the best charger i've had for my golf cart! Use it to even up the power on my solar 6volt batteries and my power wheel jeep for the kids.
B00FTDJ9FA|4|Very pleased with the final product. I would not say that the usable output is much brighter, per se, but the color is much whiter and the light from the housing is much brighter. The bulb does not throw light using the reflector in the same manner as the incandescent it replaces.  I did run into a slight issue with getting the bulbs working. I know that LEDs are polarity sensitive, but the contact patches created by the single wire strands will cause some frustration if they don't line up properly. I carefully bent each strand into a U similar to the closed loop the incandescent bulbs have to remedy the problem. Also seems to result in a snugger fit into the housing.  From an appearance, and to some degree safety perspective, these are a great upgrade. Pedestrians would be much more likely to notice that you are backing up, and the light is much cleaner than the yellow incandescent. I would say, though, if you are looking to use these to enhance visibility you might not be as impressed.
B00NRLC8SQ|1|It doesn't say they are decals... they peel off and tear up.. waste of a few bucks..
B00GBRG4TC|5|Perfect fit for my Altima 2013 SV
B000GASXMG|4|Distance between where gas valve screwed on and where pilot entered the heat pipe was slightly (1/2&#34;) wider making it necessary to stretch supply pipe causing too much air to enter the gas supply. Not your fault I acknowledge this but with the manufacturer. .
B004VDSSBA|5|Awesome wheel covers I love them!!
B00MQGFQRS|5|Looks and fits great.
B002WTJIGO|5|god
B00GSAUHB8|5|The shade works fine. i use the black side all the time as i have a black car;  looks good... works good
B006VXNGVK|5|bought for my truck but too small. It measures 9-1/2&#34; and no stretch( my '98 ford mirror is 11-1/4&#34;). I will sew an added piece of material in center  to make fit. It is cute product. After adding almost 2&#34; of black leather look material ( match my seat covers) it fit on and looks really good, I did add 3 spots of stick on Velcro on inside and it stays on then. And this isn't just on edge of mirror, there's material on back of mirror with Velcro closure.
B00Z6KCWJQ|4|I'm very happy with it!
B004IARG00|5|Installed this on my 2010 Dodge Challenger SE.  I have to say that I cannot believe how much this has improved my car's response and performance!  Anyone who owns a Challenger SE needs to buy this.  If you don't, your really missing out on what your car is capable of.  Also, it's super easy and quick to install.  The rubber edging that forms a seal when the hood shuts is a bit tricky to put on, but otherwise a few basic hand tools and about 15 to 20 minutes, and your all set to go!  It's well worth the price.
B00KJ18BI8|4|Love the light and the harness quality. Would be better if the mounting hardware were sturdier. I replaced them with 5/16 bolts. Required up drilling a bit.
B0019I9SV4|5|Perfect fit
B00HZB4R1A|1|S***, its just a sticker
B000JZYV2Y|3|had very poor quality of welds, other wise fit my car ok
B00UU1DPRY|1|This worked pretty good the first time I used it. We were in a campground in upper MI for a couple of weeks. This is the second time we have used it and we are in TN. It worked for two days, then lost satellite signal. I've tried for two days to get it back and have yet to be successful. I have the app on my phone for finding Dish for My RV satellites and have tried several places with clear views, but it will not connect. Way too much money for something that only worked a few days. I bought it about 6 weeks ago.
B00D99QN1Y|5|They fit perfect on my 2004 Honda accord, great investment.
B00MWEQ0ZQ|5|Due to Amazon apparently having a mishap in pricing on these on July 31, 2015 I was able to get these for 13 bucks. Thanks its going to look great on the gen coupe!!!<br /><br />I'll update and have pictures once they are on...:)
B00KTJ5BRE|1|Flimsy and cheaply made. I had bought the whole Camco set of levelers because I normally like this brand, but they were not paying close attention when these came off the assembly line because they are of very poor quality.
B000E7WLJW|3|It worked great on my cargo tray.  Really big travels well, but it wasn't completely waterproof.  First road trip went from Virginia through the south to Birmingham then back home through Nashville and the Blue Ridge mountains.  Bag held up great, had some rain everything was dry.  Second road trip went from Virginia to Delaware, part of the ride had VERY HEAVY rain and when we got there we noticed some water inside the bag and a few things wet.  Didn't see anywhere where the zipper wasn't zipped, couldn't find any holes in the bag so not sure where the water came in but no mistake it got in.  Considering how bad the storm was, I was disappointed but not really mad.  Nothing was ruined, there was no lingering smell of mildew or anything like that.  I don't put anything that isn't sturdy on the back of the car for a road trip anyway so it does what I need it to do.
B0057O5J32|5|I like it very much.
B003ZAGPGU|5|These work great with the ramps. When I'm not using the ramps I've been using 2/4 for keeping my boat secured in the garage.
B000CIZZQO|4|They are ok<br />Think I would order vehicle specific next time.<br />They work just fine.  I hung a little too high. So not as effective as they could be but no guide since universal of where to hang.<br />Once I drilled the holes to hang this i did not want to move
B00GYT0S4Y|2|Thought these would be made for a larger scooter the size is quite small. Guess I'll put two on one of the scooters. Really to small for any thing larger than a 50cc
B0046I3I8I|5|Just had them a few days but they stayed put during some very high winds. Also they store easy.
B00DE91T2W|5|Product was just as shown. Worker great.
B00802F2US|1|This product is cheap and garbage installed a kit the ballas stopped working same day installed and the wiring harness pulled apart to easy
B00IF5H974|2|Color too light...not math
B010WBUFDS|5|My son has to wear an ID tag for school.  The standard issue blue lanyard does nothing for his individuality.  Thanks for the break-away Pokémon option! He feels very individual in a crowd of many! Exceeded our expectations on all fronts :)
B003TTRO8U|5|Great piece
B00CMOV27C|5|So for less than half of what I would have paid to have my mechanic do a front brake job, I installed these myself and I couldn't be happier. I installed these on an 05 Sienna, which already had a professionally installed front brake job about 4 years ago. I have NEVER been impressed with the brakes in my Sienna until now. These Power Stop rotors, calipers, and pads make a HUGE difference! My stopping distance is much shorter now and no brake pulsation or shimmy, as I had ever since I owned this vehicle. When handling/ installing these components, I could tell the quality was far superior to OEM. Just make sure you follow the &#34;break-in&#34; recommendation on the instructions, otherwise your pads may not seat properly, which could lead to brake pulsation. It's actually very easy; only takes a 10 minute drive down the street.
B0093E8SRG|5|Perfect fit in my 99 TJ and easy to install.
B001O01CZC|5|Excellent product
B00KQXKG46|5|Works great
B00CEK4ZIW|5|Use this just aboutnevery day. Lobe that its so compact and holds so much biutane.
B004JKUTI0|1|Good compressor for the first month then It started rattling like a food disposal with a rock inside of it.   Well after 6 weeks of regular use in the Texas heat, the compressor seized up.  Stay away from this turd, don't buy Chinese parts, buy rebuilt oem or nothing at all.  Save yourself the money and the hassle, buy something else. Thanks for f***ing me spectra premium.
B001JT3NE6|5|Just what I needed. Looks and works great
B001JT5PH4|3|ITS OK
B0002NYDZ8|5|Well-built grease gun but there is a learning curve for me (cost me half tube of grease and one roll of paper towel). Once learning curve is over 1134 is quite predictable and work like a champ.<br /><br />First of all the rubber plunger design of 1134 is different from 1132. 1132 has quite a few youtube videos showing the plunger shape, which is a simple rubber cup with opening toward the T-handle for cartridge loading. However, 1134 came in with plunger rubber that has narrow opening facing the casting head and thicker double o-ring like cross-section at larger OD (for better sealing). I followed the instruction and flip the rubber cup facing the rear (T-handle). It was a struggle and I noticed that the rubber after being flipped over is no longer rounded at large OD in some area due to the metal plate inside (As if it was not meant to be flipped over).  Loaded with cartridge, I immediately noticed the plunger went through way too easy right after I released the T-handle. I ended up with whole tube of grease on the other side of plunger. Opened the blue tube, I can see the leak path inside the cartridge tubing due to uneven plunger rubber roundness. I don't think plunger illustration in 1134 manual matches with actual design and don't think there is need to flip the plunger at all (with this improved rubber seal design). After lengthy cleaning up (I managed to save half tube of synthetic grease), I flip the plunger back with small opening toward the casting just like when 1134 was arrived in the box. Loaded the cartridge and now the plunger is doing its job (Stopped and pushed the grease upward toward the casting). Valuable (and messy) lessons learned. I tried unloaded and loaded multiple times with different cartridge, the plunger works just fine and very smooth. No leaking grease on the spring / T-handle anymore. In short, I don’t think 1134 user manual is correct. With 1134’s new plunger rubber cross-section design, I don't see a need to flip the rubber anymore as some other models required.<br /><br />Oh yes the coupler: I have to use vise grip to break the hex loose. Before that there was no way I could attach and detach the coupler to the zerk fitting I bought for Honda trimmer gear head (6mm thread) and the factory fittings on Ariens Snowblower augers. After I manage to loosen the knurl, the coupler functions pretty well. Just loosen the knurl a few turns and attach the coupler to the zerk fitting and hand tighten the knurl to hold the zerk in place. When greasing is done, loosen the knurl fitting a few turns and detach the coupler from zerk fitting. If the goal was to safe-keeping the spring and ball inside the coupler from being lost during shipping, just bag the coupler better. I don’t see the need to make it so tight.<br /><br />Priming: I chose 1134 over 1132 for a few extra bucks because of the priming / bulk fitting 1134 has. It works most of time to burp the air out but I found combination of loosening the blue tube from casting a few turns + gentle pushing the engaged T-handle behind, plus using this priming / bulk fitting will ensure good priming. Once all air is out the grease just keep coming out every time the handle is squeezed, even after the gun sit there for a few days.<br /><br />Storage: Since I don’t use on daily basis I took the advice from one of youtube reviewer and unloaded the plunger pressure when not in use. For long term storage I take cartridge out and wipe clean the tube, plunger, and casting (inside). Put it in a bag and store it in a cool place. A bit messy but I think will help better useful life. I like this gun and intend to keep it for a long time.<br /><br />Overall a bit struggle at beginning but not-deniable built like tank and very smooth to operate. It made me to look around the house to find anything with zerk fittings.me other models required.  Oh yes the coupler: I have to use vise grip to break the hex loose.

B00XV7PXHO|5|This Leather Honey Leather conditioner works beautifully to restore distressed leather.  We purchased the leather conditioner in<br />a promotion for personal use and honest evaluation.  My husband has an old soft leather jacket that had seen better days, and<br />was planning on getting rid of it.  I decided to see if this leather honey would work to restore and condition the coat.  The product<br />goes on very thick, much like honey, but the result is fantastic, so well worth the extra elbow grease.  The coat is beautiful and<br />looks essentially new.  This product works as advertised, and we highly recommend.
B00DCXA0PM|4|Fits perfect ! Love the color
B0042ZPA9U|2|Poor quality. Would not buy again. Ripped after first use.
B009F1J6KA|3|Helmet took a fall from handlebar height to pavement. The broken one still worked except every time I forgot about it on the 3 day trip, and flipped the shield fully open to talk or get fresh air and the shield would pop out on that side. It was somewhat comical, initially I would curse at having to stop and fix it but eventually I had to just laugh at myself. Replacement was not difficult and worked as good as new, which as you likely know already is nothing to shout about but functional.
B00F0VMMSW|5|For screw-in type caliper pistons with adapters for many different vehicles. Even works well for press-in type caliper pistons.
B00D7IK868|5|I wish we had this many while trying to get home with a faulty short type issue in our trailer.  Instead... hazards on... for HOURS.  It was a long drive home in the dark.
B00REQ1YCQ|5|Perfect and the best price
B0010GDGFY|5|great works good
B00E4BV1BS|5|Part showed up quick. Everything fit well.
B00KPWB8DG|5|Nice addition to my Jeep.  Fits perfect and installation was very easy.  Good quality paint/powder coat.
B00JH6LO58|5|in the package not incluyerton me harness relay and capacitors
B001KPIA3I|5|This stuff works great on my motorcycle. It is an older bike so it is not fuel injected. I can tell the difference in power when I do not use it. Putting ethanol in the gas was just another dumb thing our stupid government did. It ruins everything. Don't know if this stuff actually does everything it says it does but I am happy with it and I use it every fill up.
B004IPOM0C|5|It worked very well .I just needed to do a few modifications on my fuel hat.
B00COOQUW2|5|Absolutely love it, very easy to install. Product arrived before the expected delivery date, which is always a plus considering I live in Hawaii!!! Cannot go wrong with a 2 year warranty either.
B001B5GA0C|3|The clutch works but does but feel anything like OEM quality.  It doesn't like being pushed hard either like the original RSX type s clutch.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for something better.  In fact just go to a dealer and buy an OEM clutch if your car is stock
B00F1FKSD8|4|It takes awhile for the computer to adjust to this filter, but when it does the change is very noticeable. Gas mileage is very good.
B0064FXRWI|1|Only last a few weeks after install. Tried to contact seller for warranty replacement (seller promotes 2 year limited warranty) my multiple messages/emails have gone ignore and I'm left with no fog lights.  product is sub par and their service is complete garbage.   WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.  Review subject to change if someone sees this review and finally decides to ship me another set.
B00OQPRPK8|4|We bought this as a gift for a friend whose car doesn't have a lot of storage space or a useable cup holder. We filled it with snacks for an upcoming road trip and he was thrilled.
B0013HJDOI|5|Good sturdy brush - just what I needed for detailing my beamer.
B00I0W1KD6|5|It Works! Very happy with the results,Sprayed all carpets under the mats,covered leather seats with a sheet and sprayed the head liner,The interior smells great and the sheet smells good too.
B004QMXS9I|5|Package arrived in a timely manner and the item worked flawlessly upon installation

B000GU1KVM|5|love the new plug wires, they look great
B0007LZK9S|5|As described.
B00KAVGUFS|1|God awful.<br /><br />Pairing is something cumbersome at best, while attempting to understand the written English instructions is just piss poor effort. Prepare to read plenty of instructions like &#34;after the success of pairing, short press the Open key, can enter the talking model.&#34; There nothing labeled or listed as the 'Open' key by the way.<br /><br />Save your money and time and pick up a better product.I myself have moved on to the Sena SMH5D
B00IKDMZ5C|5|This item worked just like the old one. and fit just like the old. really happy with it.
B005FQH96C|5|Excellent product.

B00062YACG|3|Fair
B004AIFJLI|5|Fits perfectly
B00INCDOXW|4|Rotors seem to be good quality but pads are equivalent to a $ 15 set of pads and do not include clips so plan on spending $ 25 to get the clips
B0002JMRX2|5|Great way to get that sagging door back into order. Hardest part was getting the old pin out. Go ahead and plan on taking the door off as it is easier overall and you will probably have to do it any way. Also, if you damaged the Striker Bolt with the sagging door make sure you replace that as well. I bought Needa Parts 384482 7/16&#34; Door Striker Bolt - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CHJ7R8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 for my Ford truck.
B00LBUAN46|4|Updating my review, as I finally received all of the pads.  At the moment, I have no choice but to rate this one star, until I receive my other 50 pads! It did say &#34;pack of 60,&#34; correct?
B002PMQNDE|5|Using this on a 5.3 2011 and 2009 Suburban
B000C541F8|4|Good quality part.
B006X98A7C|5|Good product, quick service.
B00MJ4D3FE|5|Fit good look good on my F250
B0015RT8X2|1|I installed these rotors only to find they were not true out of the box, they were warped just like the ones i replaced.  I had to machine them on a brake lathe to true them up. Problem went away after i machined them.  Only time will tell if they warp easily since I had to remove some metal from them.  I will probably purchase factor Motorcraft rotors next time.
B002WHCEH6|5|More than I could ask.  All parts and included the studs too.  Arrived fast.  Yet to install.
B000CITK8S|5|Battery Tender is the only brand I trust for my motorcycle battery - Installed the permanent adapter to my bike's battery and plug it in when I park. This has added over 3 years of life to my Motorcycle battery so far!!
B00BD5GSWA|4|A very pretty set! I really do love how it really stylizes my little Kia Soul. I love the shade of purple too. It has a lovely contrast to the black. The seat belt covers are cute too.<br />The reason why I did not give it five stars was because the back seat cover was extremely difficult to put on. I didn't receive any instructions on how to install it. It doesn't seem to fit too well. Also trying to secure the front seat covers were difficult as well even with instructions for the front seat covers. I find that when I get up off the front driver's seat I have to adjust the seat cover back. Kind of a pain.<br />But overall, I really do think that the difficulty installing is a minor annoyance compared to how adorable my car's interior looks now. I love it!
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Excellent sunshade for my Toyota Tundra. I would highly recommend this item.
B004AIS23A|5|Had problem typical to all Elements after a few years old, bad camber on rear tires.<br />After investigation mechanic explained the two bushing had failed on each side.<br />I purchased from Honda Dealer part #52365-S6M-004 for $50.00.<br />After replacing bushing and these control arms camber problem is gone.
B000TYOFOO|5|Purchased this item for my '94 Ford Explorer Sport. The 3rd brake light from Dorman was better that the one I replaced which was probably the original. It worked perfect. Dorman makes great products!
B00HZT4T5Q|5|This license plate frame is a high quality item. The Decepticon emblem detail is immaculate and it is securely attached to the frame. The frame itself has two (2) &#34;teeth&#34; on the rear (as pictured) that help to further secure the license plate and frame to one another so that the metals do not rattle nor clang during regular driving. After one (1) year of ownership, the frame only shows very, very light signs of oxidation from normal washing and weathering. The license plate frame definitely captures the attention of individuals with an eye for detail. I do suggest that you mount the frame with security bolts or hex screws. I am ordering a replacement following the theft of mine while my vehicle was parked overnight.
B00TEG1ZJQ|5|Great!  Received ahead of time.  Attached with no problem.  Look fantastic!
B00S94KKRC|1|Instructions are not in English.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Keeps the sun off the dash, folds quickly, fairly easily and nice and compact.&#34;
B00T62RK1U|5|Lights are bright and work great on my ranger
B008GNKIJQ|5|Went on easily and good quality.  I have had a few people question where I got the sticker and even a thumbs up from a cop.
B002M589TA|3|Rubbish
B008RCF4HC|1|The adapter was the worst I've purchased. The paint was peeling off just by touching it.  I was forced to sand and plastidip it. I'll buy from best buy or sonic from here on out.
B00NQ8ELSK|4|Work good for the money, they are a little flimsy when crimping, they might be better if soldering.
B00WH6AJ0G|1|The lock that this product came with is very cheap.  we installed the cover and the lock broke .  Since the cover was already installed , we had to purchase a new lock.
B00E1SOJH2|5|Rotors and pads are great. I've had them on my 2005 Grand Caravan now for about two weeks. Less brake dust, and great stopping power. I will order from Callahan for all of my vehicles that need brakes in the future. Thanks Callahan
B00IPS4APU|5|Just finished repairing chips on two different cars.  This product works well.  It's not perfect, but one chip was reduced by approximately 90% and the other almost completely eliminated.  Definitely worth the cost and really did not too much effort to perform the repair.
B00IPS3LRS|1|The frame of the wiper blade didn't fit my 2004 BMW X3 even though the Rain-X fitting guide in my local auto shop said it would. There's a Bosch one that will fit the X3.
B0048IZVLS|1|not the right part for 2000 like add says.  Needs additional electrical contacts that cant be added. also started making a bad loud sound right after install.  very poor product and now they wont take it back.
B0065LZA94|5|I added these filters along with external transmission coolers to several of my cars that do not have real filters in the transmission. I want my transmissions to last as long as the engines and it seems that for newer cars, the manufacturer's maintenance recommendations don't have transmission fluid replacement intervals. These did not come with clamps or hose splices, so you might need to go to your local parts store to get what you need to install them.
B000BZG8ZU|4|Works fine. Easy to assemble.
B000IY80MI|5|Fit perfectly and work properly.
B00PV94OC0|5|Great product! I have a 2001 Acura CL 3.2 Type S, with 140K miles. This car has been my baby, and I just bought this to enhance its look.<br />Great product, great looks, great craftsmanship.<br />Ricardo
B00COYNZJ8|5|didnt quite fit my car perfectly but was great otherwise
B009OPYMVU|5|Fast delivery & quality product.
B00OLVG4G8|5|Was easy to install, was delivered within days. Everything matched up to the vehicle, total installation was about two hours with both sides could have been done faster had I used power tools.
B009FPCCHU|5|Worked perfectly as needed.  Would buy again without hesitation.
B00JWG4P7C|5|Very bright. Seem to be well made. Not cheap or flimsy. Looking forward to trying them out.
B002XIKJL2|5|Perfect fit and the plug makes changing the fluid a whole lot quicker and less messy.
B007Y86H8K|4|works fine. Well see how long it will works
B00MU9BYS6|5|Satisfied! Good product. Fast delivery. Recommend.
B00GUA8UCO|4|These are pretty good, but not quite what I was looking for.  Each assembly has 24 LEDs which makes them brighter than what I expected.  Also the light is a bit colder than what I prefer for the application I had in mind.  On the positive end, they put out a tremendous amount of light, look pretty nice, and are very economical to run.  I would recommend this product where you want a strong light source and where a warm light ambience isn't what you're looking for.
B001PYC62U|3|Spring too big, had to trim it down with a cut off wheel. Clips were wrong depth and had to modify those too. It is functional...
B007NZ87E6|5|CV Shaft was the correct part for my 2007 H3, installed great and solved my problem! Great price, would buy again here.
B00SUNHB7Y|5|My FZ1 sports cruiser is black and gray. (Blacked out engine)it's a dark bike to begin with. when I put on these new LEDs the bike stands out now and then some!<br />  I don't like to write reviews,<br />what does this tell you...
B00HSHWC7M|5|Works as described and much brighter than the factory lights. A+!
B000X23V7O|5|I like it.
B00BLKXW9O|5|Mobil ATF 3309 meets or exceeds the requirements of: Ford spec WSS-M2C924-A<br />So This can be used as a cost effective substitute for Ford Fluid part#: XT-8-QAW Premium Automatic Transmission<br />Links:<br />https://mobiloil.com/en/automatic-transmission-fluid/3309-atf#Mobil ATF 3309<br />https://www.fcsdchemicalsandlubricants.com/main/product.asp?product=Premium%20Automatic%20Transmission%20Fluid&category=Transmission%20Fluid
B00A1AX1VE|5|Just as described!!
B001AWNQCG|5|It's good and nice, fit as original one.
B00873J0YY|1|Bolts don't stay in place when putting the nuts on. Also the soft rubber pieces are already ripping.
B002OAT5SC|5|Fits the tank on my Harley Davidson Sportster XL883L perfectly! I love how it protects my tank and also holds a few small items for easy access, including extra glasses.
B0068FZ3A8|5|It works as expected, truly plug-n-play
B00KOU2UYU|5|Exactly as described. Worked great on 2014 silverado.
B0041CAGHK|3|This product was not easy to install. It does NOT come with a luggage rack, which is shown in the picture. Nor does it come with hardware or adequate instructions. Thank goodness for YouTube!
B003DRA9US|4|These were very affordable and looked great BUT they started pealing after a year so I got what I paid for
B00GB7XZ44|3|I bought these because I had purchased the Darth Vader rear floor mats and thought the combination would look cool. All I wanted was for something to cover my carpet in my new car and it does that. They don't fit perfectly but I wasn't expecting them to. The white does get dirty fast but I knew that was going to happen, it's white. Would I buy them again? Probably not, but they do serve their purpose for now.
B00MJ0RNFY|2|Hard as hell to get on my shifter (perhaps I should have read the suggestion for using silicone spray. I wouldn't be concerned about the tough installation if it actually worked. I wear tan boots everyday and my boots are pretty black where the shifter meets the boot. Perhaps my boot isn't &#34;scuffed&#34;, but it does leave a mark. Doesn't work for me.
B00S5FH77Q|1|Awful.
B00GSAUHB8|5|My husband loves this Sunshade!  It definitely keeps the interior much cooler, as well as protecting the dashboard.  It fits the windshield, perfectly and is very easy to put up and take down!  As well as being a perfect sunshade, it's also very reasonably priced!  I highly recommend this product and this seller!,
B007K8AA7I|4|I have owned this head light before, bright and has a great light pattern. bought it again for my 2015 HD Ulrta Limited and when I get the adapter problem worked out will replace the Harley LED with this one.
B00KWDJ7Y0|5|Nice. Just as described.
B00JHK81X2|3|a little flimsey
B0019SVYMK|5|Good quality
B004A6K82K|5|Quality part For half the price! Exact fit, 1 month so far and cools well! 97 grand Cherokee 4.0 central Pennsylvania
B004C65DYQ|5|Fits perfectly
B001ASAH18|5|Very well made! Little snug on the fit! The vents are nice touch!
B002U2IERC|1|I followed the instructions, but parts of it would not come off of the paper! What a mess!  Such a poor quality vinyl!  I ended up throwing it away, cause it got so damaged from trying to remove the paper and trying to stick it to my car bumper.  A total waste of money!
B004BTT2SM|5|Great for my Hyundai santa fe. I like that they included new clips as well
B0000CBIK5|3|As it says, it's OK but what bothered me is that it doesn't come w at least a Presti - Schaeder adapter!!
B0055DPSXG|5|Fit was just right.  Quality material.  This gasket works great for KX/RM 65.
B00HZBMOQK|1|I'd give 0 stars if I could. Product came 4 days late. The white vinal sticker...yes I said STICKER!...had pink drawn lines around the edge of the flip flops that wouldn't come off. It was hard to peel off its backing, and it stretched out of shape while in the process notater how carefully I tried. I tossed it! Thanks but no thanks.
B007QQRKXG|5|For about the same price as the couple of fasteners I needed I was able to get this entire kit.  The parts I needed fit perfectly and I have a selection for future repairs.  This was a no brainer.
B003GCSJAC|4|Good product, as others have commented, it's diff than picture in that it has a pointed end, which is all the better for use.
B00FMUYXA6|5|Perfect for C7.
B007VR6Z36|5|Decent quality. I used this to mount a second battery in my Jeep. It work well and holds up too.
B0076D56UI|5|worked as expected
B000KE54F2|1|If I could give these a 0 star review, I would. The item description said these were custom fit for a Mazda Miata but in reality they're generic seat covers with a separate headrest cover.  Put them on the seat and they looked awful - wouldn't form to the seat and the headrest cover was useless as the Miata has a one-piece seat back.<br /><br />My biggest regret was that I didn't open the box until after the 30 day return deadline passed. Lucky for me I bought them from Warehouse Deals so I'm only out $60 instead of the full $120 price
B00684TAYY|4|Recently order this.<br />Its a good product & easy to configure...
B00G620ZVU|2|One of them had moisture behind the lens right out of the box... still worked, but quite disappointing...
