1476712042|5.0|I seriously cried when I finished this book. Real tears. WHY DID IT HAVE TO END?!<br /><br />I read at least three romance novels a week but find myself using Beautiful Disaster as a measuring stick to all the other books, they simply do not measure up. The characters are so believable. Travis is such a bad boy and he plays the part perfect - he makes you want to cross over to the dangerous side by just reading! The fighting, the tattoos, the reputation....Travis was delicious.<br /><br />The author creates characters that really make you develop feeling for them - they become part of your day and you fall asleep thinking about them. There is enough conflict in this book to keep you entranced and the romance was off the charts. I really really wish that the author will make more books!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Good app for those Pintrest junkies! You're able to access all of your boards and others, too! Easy to use and navigate around.

0965773604|5.0|My book arrived for me in Australia in excellent packaging. I would have loved a slip cover but the hard cover was perfect and the movie is amazing but the book is better.<br />What an incredible story.<br />I challenge anyone to read the first page and not feel like they can not put it down until they finish it. Harper Lee was an extraordinary authoress....what a book.<br />It is a book that grabs your heart on the first page and you KNOW you just have to read it all, and then later, again.<br />Harper takes you into the community, you are a neighbour and you can SEE all that is happening in the storyline.<br />Harper gives the read two things - the words and, the pictures in your mind's eye.<br />You will love this book and mine will always be on my bookshelf.

B0076DCT2G|2.0|In Nelson DeMille's book &#34;The Panther&#34; the author chose to include John Corey's stupid mental quips time and time again.  There was at least one on every page and was very distracting and irritating.  His contract must have included a specific number of  pages.  I have read several of DeMille's previous books and had never noticed this before.  I quit after reading about 1/4 of the book.  If i purchase another of his books I will pay close attention to reader's comments and reviews.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One was a fun ride, a quick read, and one obviously written with a ton of passion.  A rags to riches adventure story so reminiscent of The Goonies it might have well had Cyndi Lauper singing the soundtrack.  Wait, I think Cyndi Lauper was referenced at least three times.  Or was she?<br /><br />Ready Player One is about a treasure hunt, THE treasure hunt of all time, set inside a digital world like some hybrid of EVE Online and World of Warcraft.  The author, obviously a geek himself, throws just enough references for the rest of us nerds to know that either he (a) is one of us, or (b) researched it so well he might as well wear the hat of honorary nerd.  I'm pretty sure it's (a).  So, the plot: a Steve Jobs-esque video game creator dies penniless and childless, leaves his entire fortune hidden within his virtual world, OASIS, and sets up a contest where winner takes all... of his wealth and power.<br /><br />The players are: a scrappy kid from a trailer park (or stack of trailer parks) vs. a multinational corporation that's beyond corrupt, it's what Zynga/Farmville would look like if had the GDP of North America.  Sure, there's the geeky girl gamer, the Asian assassins, the plucky best friend, but what's really interesting is who these people are OUTSIDE the OASIS.  Looks can, and are, very deceiving in a world where you can be anything<br /><br />Ready Player One is a digital Running Man, TRON with magic and Matrix-esque haptric pods.  It's part treasure hunt, part meditation on the 21st condition of digital detachment, and part cautionary tale on what the world could be like if we let virtual reality become, well, reality.  And more than all that, it's a love letter to a generation the writer obviously grew up in, a time when synth music and 8-bit games make the world a little more interesting, and an extra life was only a quarter away.<br /><br />My only beef with the book, and it's a small one, was that the story is sometimes betrayed by a writing style that feels rushed.  Often reader knows less than the character and is left in the dark wondering either if they missed some key bit of information, or just why the narrator is doing something.  Works well in some stories, this one, not so much.  But still, it's an easily forgivable flaw, and one that may boil down to personal interest.<br /><br />If you're a geek like me, then READY PLAYER ONE is really a no brainer: drop the coin into the slot, press START, and enjoy the ride.style that feels rushed.

1419707663|5.0|very cutely written books, also quite funny. i bought for someone else but am quite enjoying them myself and i am over 30!
B0074VTHKM|1.0|I was very disappointd in this book. Not up to the quality story of other Grisham books. Kept waiting for the story to take some kind of interesting turn, never happened. Not worth the price, or any price for that matter.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|It has many funny moments, but overall the humor is crude and the plot weak. You wouldn't miss much if you skip it.
B009POHHRG|5.0|This is one of the best graphic novels ever published, and finally available in electronic form.<br /><br />This is a rare gem from the era when a great idea could be told in a single installment rather than the entire line of comics for one summer.
B0050KTR36|4.0|The muscles are alright I would like to see origins and insertions included. But for the most part its good.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Though I respect all the Star Treks movies and shows out there over the years, the stories about the original crew are my favorite for sure.  And while I enjoy the early movies with that original crew, this modern take on the same characters is fantastic.  All of the actors did a great job, combined with fantastic effects, and having Leonard Nimoy appear as the original Spock was icing on the cake.  This disc also contains one of the funniest gag reels I have ever seen, and I still laugh about it years later.  All I can say is that I am very looking forward to the next one due out in May 2013 and the fact that JJ Abrams will direct the next Star Wars movie gives me a &#34;new hope&#34; that that movie will be nothing short of spectacular also.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game! One of the best and a must to play. Highly recommended! My daughter & I just love playing soul surfer.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Regardless of how you feel about the 4th one (which I liked a lot -- yes, you read that right), it's great to have all 4 movies together remastered in Hi Def.  The picture and sound are fantastic, and the first movie looks especially good considering its age.  The only issue is the bonus features are mostly from the standard DVD set which came out in 2003 and they look a bit harsh in Hi Def for some reason, but that's a very minor criticism.  This is a must have set of movies, so until/if/when they make another one I highly recommend you get this and see Dr Jones in all his whip-cracking glory.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Will purchased it for my 12 year old! Was gonna wait to give it to her for valentines but had a change of heart... Cd got here just as promised !!!! Will purchase more items from this seller..... Thank you my daughters happy!!!!
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Being a die-hard &#34;Alien&#34; fan, I was thrilled to see this story take part in the same universe.  Sadly, the movie is not quite as exciting as I was hoping for.  That's not to say it's a bad movie, but some of the scenes feel forced and obligatory, and with Prometheus 2 on the way time will tell if this movie is merely a setup for future films.<br /><br />As for the disc itself, there are a lot of extended and/or cut scenes in the extras section that they really should have been redited into the film as a director's cut. There is a lot of backstory in these scenes and they would have made the story richer, for sure.<br /><br />Regardless, the picture and sound quality are great and Michael Fassbender is a complete scene-stealer as the android David.  This film also has some of the most beautiful scenery (watch the first 5 mins) and fantastic special effects I have ever scene in a film.  Definitely worth a watch, only die hard &#34;Alien&#34; or Ridley Scott fans should probably buy it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Exactly how the book reads. Overall good, though the end was slightly disappointing. If you have some time, I'd recommend it.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I love the first Leps world but the second is disappointing movements are jerky at times an in slow motion at others. then toward the end you haveto wall jump to reach your goal but it wont hold onto the left side it just falls down.  :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive game and due to the daily challenges and missions doesn't get boring. Also like the change in place every so often.<br />Have recommended highly to friends and family

B00755MHXG|5.0|Having little time to scroll through all the reviews of all the books on offer and sometimes miss the \\"good reads\\" often happens.  So, stumbling across Wonder (almost a year after it was first published) was not only enlightening but time well spent.  There are many books to choose from but few that are this worthwhile.  The only thing to be said about this book that hasn't already been said in the numerous reviews is, read it.. don't hesitate.  Wonder flows, makes you laugh, cry and cheer in the turn of a page.  R.J. Palacio must be applauded over and over for this book.  The human condition has been captured in its raw form and turned it on its head.  His skillful writing has reminded us all of our most basic of shortcomings, prejudice.  This book allows us to  not only look at Auggie, the dynamite little boy with a hideous facial deformity and the strength he shows every single day of his life,  it forces us to probe our own emotions and understand through love, that intolerance can be overcome.  To those out there who appreciate a book for its strength of character and empathy...this book most definitely says it all.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie is AWESOME!!! The DVD does NOT contain deleted scenes, which was a bit of a downer. Otherwise, endless hours of great movie watching!!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! The minions are adorable (so are the kids) and it's entertaining and funny (even for adults).
B005IQZB14|5.0|It is a very touching narrative, showing how it is indeed possible to re-construct oneself after facing terrible situations in life!<br /><br />It is fascinating \\"to stay\\" with Cheryl all over the way. We can really feel that we are with her, through all her moments of joy and grief, watching all the nature beauty through her eyes.<br /><br />She has the gift of letting the readers feel so close to her that we end the reading of the book feeling as if we indeed have known her for a long time.<br /><br />Facing painful situations is our \\"inheritance\\" in this world. The big difference is HOW we choose to deal with them.<br /><br />This book is a real celebration of life. I do recommend it!<br /><br />Try also: [ASIN:B00AWDOK9M A Guide to Forgiveness - True Forgiveness According to A Course in Miracles]]

0060254920|5.0|This book is a great way to introduce children on how your imagination can take you to all kinds of places and situations. Even though Max is sent to his bedroom for being mischievous-that's when his imagination takes off! He begins his journey with his bedroom turning into a forest, setting the scene. His imagination then takes him on a sailboat, sailing though the night and day, eventually getting to shore and meeting THE WILD THINGS! The wild rumpus is the most fun of all! Great book full of imagination and great illustrations.

0307341577|4.0|Gone Girl was easily my most favorite novel of 2012 and who knows, it just might stay that way in 2013. So taken was I with Gillian Flynn that I would read anything she writes. I picked up Dark Places and was not disappointed. My review actually gets 4.5 stars not 4. The sickness and depravity that took up permanent residence in the lives of these characters was shocking as were the twists and turns of trying to figure out how the story pieces together by the end. It's doubtful you're going to figure it all out ahead of time. There is just way too much going on and Flynn's drawing from a very convoluted and complex well of insanity is in direct opposition to those formulaic, snooze-worthy stories that some authors churn out like butter. I would not recommend comparing Dark Places to Gone Girl. They are not the same story, nor are they structured the same way, nor should any of us expect them to be. Dark Places is told from Libby's perspective in the present day with alternating chapters dating back to the day of the murders featuring some of the members of Libby's family including her deceased mother.<br /><br />As a child, Libby Day lived through the murders of her mother and both her sisters while she managed to escape unharmed. Now as an adult, her only living sibling in prison for the murders, Libby lives life largely in the shadows. Mostly forgotten by a public once so enamored of her story, she stumbles aimlessly from one day to the next. After being sought out by a group of rag tag individuals who call themselves The Kill Club, a group of geeks obsessed with solving Libby's family's crime and absolving her brother Ben, whom they believe is not guilty of the murders, Libby reconnects with her past in an attempt to finally understand what happened that brutal night. The nightmare reemerges to haunt Libby in ways she never expected.<br /><br />I'd recommended Dark Places to any Flynn fan and all those who love a good psychological thriller however there is a fair share of gore present so tread lightly if you have a weak stomach.r share of gore present so tread lightly if you have a weak stomach.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome.....there once was a girl who loved to danced ......so she so she Frances and danced she said tout mageizty I was born to dance. it was so very true
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love the action and the suspense.  It's a great book because you get involved with all the characters.  Not just the main guy, Reacher who you can't help but adore.  It's not predictable..............and just enough sub-plots.  I would recommend to anyone who likes this type of adventure.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|First of all this is just and amazing game on its playability and smoothness. Of course the movement controls are somewhat wacky but for the most part the game is easily playable. About campaign we've all seen it so many times evil man who wants to get rid of America and all that but the multiplayer is my favorite. The only major flaw I realize in multiplayer is that sometimes when you're in a game in a multiplayer session that it might say for example you have $12,000 but when you exit to buy something it will increase or ( Almost always decrease it. ) maybe to around 9,000. But to sum things up great game and graphics and keep it up Gameloft! Can't wait for MC5!

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Usually I don't read war  novels but after viewing an interview with author, Adam Makos, I was convinced to give A Higher Call a chance. He promised a compassionate, truly inspiring novel about human empathy during war. I have not been disappointed. Makos has humanized all the characters, particularly  Charlie and Franz, the American and German pilots whose lives collide in the skies, making it possible to see them as men first and soldiers second.  In addition, I love the historical aspect of the novel. I feel like I've learned something more about WWII history.

As someone who has lived and has family in WV (the movie takes place in Missouri), I found it to be a very realistic portrayal of how some people live.

B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|For roughly a decade I continued to hear from the music press and the general public that any music showcasing any instrumental or production virtuosity was \\"corporate\\". This was in terms of rock music. Unless you were a garage band plugging your guitars into an amp with a microphone,you seriously risked being labeled as \\"irrelevant\\". And that word was basically a commercial death sentence to anyone who didn't tow the line. The contradictions of the alternative rock press have been exposed by the fact that artists like Toto's own Steve Lukather have not only soldiered on musically,even when people didn't want to listen to them,but by the fact he celebrated and advocated advanced and professional musicianship through his playing and sound as well. After a string of musically successful solo career during the new millennium,Lukather is back again with an album that again finds him breaking new ground.<br /><br />  The album opens with \\"Judgement Day\\",an excellent example of progressive hard rock with some amazingly melodic sheets of electric guitar,drum fills and bass lines. On \\"Creep Motel\\",one of my favorites here along with \\"Rest Of The World\\" he's dealing with the heavy blues side of his playing on two numbers showcasing a mix of rock/blues/jazz fusion that's hard grooving and even funky-rather like a harder guitar rocking Steely Dan if you think about it. One \\"Once Again\\" he showcases the more subtle side of his passionate musical personality with a wonderfully melodic piano based ballad. The title song,mostly instrumental,is a very intense jazz/rock fusion number matching Lukather's amazing guitar skills with the unique keyboard harmonies of Steve Weingart. \\"Last Man Standing\\" has a mild country rock flavor to it where \\"Do I Stand Alone\\" showcases a staccato rhythm guitar style that probably once gave U2's The Edge a few ideas.<br /><br />  Musically this album is incomparable. Not only is the musicianship extremely adept in every respect,but the strong melodies and hook friendly sense of song craft are easier reminders of the importance of studio rock craftsmanship. What thrills me most about this album though is it's conceptualization. Lukather's solo musical triumphs have come during a very sociologically distressing time for the world at large. The lyrics on this album very much point to the fact that,in 1999 and 2012 alike there was mass paranoia about apocalyptic cataclysm-first Y2K than the Mayan calender fiasco. Lukather's lyrics here combine with the probing,often restless compositions to reflect both his own personal concerns as an aging musician with the need he and many other people have to keep the world from disappearing by our own sometimes ignorant hands. It's exactly what modern rock and roll needs: extending on the 60's/70's ethic of expanding ones own ego beyond oneself into the broader spectrum of the people. For that and his crackerjack musicianship,I have to thank Mr.Lukather for that.and hook friendly sense of song craft are easier reminders of the importance of studio rock craftsmanship.

I would recommend this show to anyone who appreciates great acting and historical pieces that seem to be happening right now. Great cast and every episode leaves a lasting impression. Hope it goes on for many seasons!!
B008B92U32|4.0|Very easy to use and had a lot of fun with it. Got it for free, but it would be worth the money either way.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I chose this book because I have read other Jodi Picoult books.  She is the kind if author that makes you want to keep reading. Then when the book has ended you wish there were more..then you find another of her books.  I keep her books in a special section of my Kindle.  I recommended this book to my Library Group for review.  They will love it..I just know it.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Although her lyrics make me worry about the healthiness and longevity of her lifestyle and life choices, I love Lana del Rey and her sassy soulful dirty music. She's a bit naughty and risqu&eacute; but makes it sound haunting and gorgeously delicate at the same time. I don't know if there's an album I love more than thus right now.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|As always, DeMille has created a yarn that is fun and interesting to read. Mr. Corey can make any reader uncomfortable and laugh at the same time.  More Paul Brenner, please!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Rebus is back! And you can never, ever go wrong with a book centered around John Rebus. I feared his retirement meant we would never hear from him again. Here we not only get Rebus, but also Malcolm Fox, the protagonist of Rankin's more recent books. Their personalities make them perfect adversaries, and I hope this book is just the beginning of a series. You don't need to have read the previous books to follow the characters, but they are all so entertaining that I highly recommend starting from the beginning and leading up to this. You won't be disappointed. They are great, gritty crime procedurals.
B009DKFST6|4.0|Overall, a very nice album.  I love &#34;Don't Stop the Party.&#34;  I was hoping for more of Pit Bull and instead lots of other artists.  I will be ordering another Pit Bull cd that has him and his songs only.  Still, this is a very nice album, no matter what.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I thought this was a good wholesome book. It was fun to read. I will get more of the Lexy Baker books.

B00A2LOAKI|3.0|I wanted to like this and the previous Part 1.  Really, I did.  I've been re-reading the graphic novel every few years since it came out in 1986, and I hear the dialogue in my head as I get to each panel.  When DC released the direct-to-video version, I had high hopes for how they'd translate it to the screen, and looked forward to seeing it animated.<br /><br />It's not bad, certainly.  They did a fair job, but there were two gaping holes in my opinion.  First, the creators of the movies did away with the internal monologue that was the real treat.  What set TDKR apart from the rest of the comics at the time was the inside look at what's going on in Bruce Wayne/Batman's head.  You followed along with his thought process as he looked at the world as it had become, and it was the combination of the story being told (which was fairly well represented in the movie) with the monologue that provided the glue that held it together.  His running internal commentary as he chases the Joker through the Tunnel of Love.  His internal commentary as he beat the snot out of Superman.  The creators have taken some of that internal monologue and turned it into dialogue, but it's just not the same.  I expected to hear the monologue as part of the soundtrack to the action, and the lack of that monologue reduced the film to merely an animated version of the action on the panels, not what the story was about.<br /><br />Secondly, I'm afraid I've been spoiled by other voice actors.  Ever since Batman: TAS came out, I hear Kevin Conroy's voice in my head when I read something thought or said by the character.  It was certainly interesting to hear Peter Weller's voice bring some Robocop-like nuances to the role, but Weller's voice fell short.  This was especially apparent in the scenes where Batman rode into Gotham during the blackout to restore order.  I expected a deep, resonant, commanding voice to issue forth and captivate the Sons of the Batman...and instead Weller's voice couldn't provide that, and sounded high and flat.  He might have coasted when delivering conversational dialogue, but not when it needed weight, strength, and command for that scene.  To add insult to injury, Batman is supposed to be about 55, right?  Kevin Conroy would have been 56 when this was recorded.  Think about how great that could have sounded.  I don't hold the creators to blame, as I'm sure they have to diversify the voice talent across the direct-to-video releases, but someone should have earmarked Conroy for this story.<br /><br />Two nits.  First, the pacing seemed off.  Perhaps it's because I read it the graphic novel for years at my own pace, and inserted my own sense of timing, but I felt that Part 2, in particular, was rushed.  Some scenes felt like they were picking up too quickly without the sense that enough time had passed.  I might have been able to write this complaint off if the movie was released as a single disc, but if you're going to ask me to pay twice for two movies, the least you can do is pace it.  Not that I'm bitter.<br /><br />The second nit: the death of the Joker.....they changed how it happened, and again, missed out on representing an important part of the Batman character, still not able to take a life at the very end.  It was a wasted opportunity, and I don't see why they couldn't include that.  It's as if the subtlety was lost on the writer....although this point wasn't that subtle.<br /><br />I'll give the creators some credit, though.  The design and animation was fairly respectful to the original graphic novel art, with some updates, so I felt like I was watching a fair adaptation of the graphic novel.  Also, getting Conan O'Brien to voice the talk show host David Endochrine?  Amusing, appropriate, and ironic, all at the same time.  Well done.<br /><br />In the end, I'll give it only 3 stars.  I was happy to see them include it in their slate of direct-to-DVD movies, and it was an interesting movie to watch, but I think I'll get more enjoyment out of the TAS episodes they bundled with the package than a repeat watching of the movie.  Fortunately, I still have the original graphic novel to re-read.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Let me say I bought this book and literally read through it non-stop. The story line was really intriguing and the characters really pull you in. Plus there is going to be a sequel in April that is from travis point of view. Very cool.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|When this show first came out, I was expecting a flop. After all, what does the CW have other than old sitcoms in syndication and shows that have been rejected by ABC Family? I had no intention of watching a show centered around a DC Universe B-lister. But then I heard good things about Arrow, heard that it was a superhero show done right. Sounded good, so I watched the pilot on a whim...<br /><br />Ten hours later, I've finished the series to date, and I'm Googling when the next episode will air. At first, I thought this was going to be some bad superhero show. Then I heard it was supposed to be a good superhero show. But both were wrong. Arrow is just a good show, in general. The writing is so solid that I find myself 100% enthralled in each and every character and side plot.<br /><br />Yes, Oliver Queen is on a mostly one-man mission to right his father's wrongs and rid Starling City of an evil criminal shadow organization. But you know what else is happening? Oliver's sister is developing a drug problem. His step father is suspicious that his mother is embezzling money from the family business. Oliver's best friend is trying to shed his playboy persona and settle down with the one girl he ever really loved: Oliver's ex-girlfriend. I care about every single goddamn one of those plots, and the show explores them wonderfully. I can't wait to see how the rest of the season unfolds.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I've seen most of the RE movies, and realize that people don't watch them for the plot. This one seems to take that attribute too far though. I feel like the characters rarely talked, and even when they did, it was normally just some cheesy lines relating to an upcoming or former fight scene. Plus the story line in general wasn't that great in my opinion. I'd avoid this one, or at least rent it before buying.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This is a good adventure, mystery book.  The reader is always waiting in anticipation about what will happen next.<br /><br />The writer is very skilled in the technical aspects of the subject matter, and their verbal descriptions.<br /><br />The plot and characterization and continuity is quite complex and difficult to follow.  The author, in essence, has prepared an 8 course meal, while a 5 courser would have been adequate.

Since this was the second time I tried to buy this DVD, I checked on the information provided to make sure it was in the right region. It didn't say region 2 as some of the other DVDs for said so I assumed that it was the correct region.  When it came, it was region 2 which we can't use in the USA.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my name is gavin and I love this game so i will give it a 1000000000 stars it is not a waste of money
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I loved this series. I watched it every night (2-3 episodes a night) for about 4 nights.  I didn't want it to end.  If I didn't have a life during the day, I would have watched it in one sitting. Highly recommend. Just received season 3 in the mail. Yay!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive. Got for my son but finding I play it just as much! Fun and fast paced. Graphics are also very good. So far no glitches.
B008HK3XU4|1.0|it didn,t fit. returned same for  credit. you come up with the extra words. this is BS.ok ok ok ok
B004GYY714|5.0|I listen to tunein radio all the time, nice variety of sounds and will keep using the app, I would download again.
B000002KHY|5.0|Have always loved his voice. These songs bring back such memories, some good, some not so good, but the memories are there when I hear him sing.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A milder version of fifty shades.<br />Loved reading from both point of views.<br />Would defiantly recommend to all my friends.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I purchased this for my husband since he was looking for a work laptop bag. He loves it and uses it every day. It's very light, durable and has lots of small pockets he can put iPod, sunglasses, laptop, and etc. Very useful and highly recommended!
0131103628|5.0|This book is still popular years after it was published due to the fact that it is concise, readable, and relevant. Anyone looking to learn C programming should start with this book, it may be the only one you need.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|This documentary highlights a unique individual whose art had a life of its own, having an impact halfway across the world, while relatively unknown in his own country. A beautiful testament to the interconnected web of life.
B007W7P5L8|4.0|simple design, easy to use, and provides enough protection. Like the clip in system to secure Kindle. So far it is durable.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game so addicting and very hard thinking to win. This is for very smart people who can run an enterprise. I hope you will enjoy this great game.
B003VANOFY|2.0|If you are looking for a solid pair of wireless headphones for the pc, then these will fit your needs. But If you are looking for a decent surround sound experience, the G930's completely fail to deliver.<br /><br />After gaming on a surround sound system, I was blown away with how much was added to my experience. Since my personal setup was not optimal for a speaker system, I opted for a pair of headphones instead. After spending many hours reading reviews, I decided on the G930 both because people said it had good overall sound quality, and for the convenience of wireless.<br /><br />While the sound quality and convenience of wireless did not disappoint, I can not say the same for surround sound experience. I wasn't expecting the exact same quality as a speaker system, but I was expecting to at least be able to roughly locate from where a sound was emanating. While there is definitely some spatial qualities to the sound, it is murky and ill defined.<br /><br />In the end, I decided to return these and bought a pair of more expensive Astro A50's. They, despite their own problems, provide the surround sound experience I was looking for. I wouldn't recommend everyone buy them, but if you were wondering if you could get a surround sound experience with headphones, know that you can. Possibly settle for a less expensive wired pair instead.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|This is one the best movies in cinema history.  It has a love story along with being science fiction without all that science geeky nerdy stuff that usually happens in science fiction.  Watch again and again and you will keep finding small things you missed.  The movie shows one days events from so many perspectives and entertains the viewer while also supplying tons of laughs.  Easily one of the top 5 movies ever made in cinema history.  Belongs in the greatness of movies like Casablanca, Singin' in The Rain, Citizen Kane and Sherlock Jr (Buster Keaton).
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I was not much of a Beetles fan, but McCartny is great on this album. The selection of tunes, and, of course, the Diana Krall<br />musicians, put this disc near the top of my list of favorites. The recording quality was also excellent.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when it was originally in the theaters.  I wore out a VHS copy and had to replace it with a digital one.  It's classic early 70's scifi with a great story line and good acting.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|If you loved playing Nintendos Mario back in the day, you are going to love this game. Giving it five stars mainly because of how it is almost like Mario.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh my goodness, I am like addicted to subway surfers !!!<br />It is so much fun .it is a must have for everyone !!!
B009B08LJ2|5.0|Watched Dark Knight Rises and decided we had to see all three in this series. Kids and I really enjoyed this movie!  It is a dark story with violence and I would be mindful of ages/maturity level of children before watching as a family.
0785152458|5.0|This series technically isn't that great but it really is entertaining and you'll most likely finish it in a day or two. It's fun.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I love the Bourne  movies, I did not like the last one without Jason Bourne in it.  This one kept up with the intense drama the first 2 books had.
B000059MEK|5.0|It's one of the most entertaining and fun albums to dance to ever in my opinion. It's really special to me.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I had to read this in high school...and hated it.  After seeing the newest movie, I decided to read it again (50 years after the first read).  I will never read another book by Victor Hugo...  I wanted to see how the movie tracked with the book, and the tiny bits and pieces chosen for the movie track fairly well, comprising less than the equivalent of a short paperback, while the book is nearly 1,000 pages.  That would be fine, but Hugo takes 20 pages to say a rose is red, shoes are worn, etc.  But he was a poet.  The endless rambling and describing every little detail 40 different ways while using every $100 word in the dictionary quickly becomes torturous.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Awsome game. Only thing that I don't like is the controls, mainly the tilting It's not as sensitive as Temple Run 1. Fix and 5 stars
B005EGXNLS|5.0|If you are into our early European &#34;civilization,&#34; it is very entertaining and enlightening.  It is hard to put down.
034580404X|5.0|these books are awesome. easy to read and will keep you interested in reading them to the end would recommed them to anyone.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|This is one of the best read-aloud books ever. It has a deliciously spiteful villain--the Trunchbull (every kid has known someone like her)--and one of the best endings ever. Amidst all the comedy and hijinks is a wonderful message about the power of love. It's been around for years, but it's still marvelous. It will have you laughing out loud and cheering for one of literature's great heroes--the very brainy, very courageous, indomitable Matilda.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Always there when you need it. Just say a word and it goes right to it or you can look it up.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Couldn't wait to follow her journey, although difficult at times. Passions found in life can save a life. I have asked my daughter to read, The Language of Flowers.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|It's an ethernet adapter and works instantly. I plugged it into my MacBook Air (Summer 11) and it instantly worked - no drivers, no install time. It's quite expensive, and the USB version would have been acceptable, but if you have a gigabit switch, and want to transfer data quickly on the network, this is a good product. I currently only connect at 100Mbps, but this is good for the future. Also, it doesn't hog up a USB port, which I use, where as I don't use the Thunderbolt port for anything.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|wow imago studios has d&oslash;ne it again! this game is better cuz the grafics and the zipline I would recommend it
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I'll admit I've never read the Judge Dredd comics, though I did see the Stallone movie.  I enjoyed both, but I prefer Dredd--a much grittier, more violent story.<br /><br />Mega-City One is a sprawling metropolis that stretches from what was New York to Baltimore.  Mixed in with the buildings and 'high-rises' that might be seen in any contemporary cities are the mega-structures that dwarf the buildings around them; small cities in themselves.  The technology is 'near future' rather than distant, and the cities are all concrete and motor oil; much harsher than the sleek, futuristic scape in the Stallone movie and more appropriate for the postapocolyptic theme, I think.  Mega-City One, and the Peach-Tree mega-structure that is the setting for the bulk of the movie, have a realistic atmosphere that sets the tone for story.<br /><br />The story itself follows Judge Dredd and rookie Judge Anderson, who is being assessed by Dredd in a sink-or-swim manner.  When they decide to investigate a triple murder at Peach Tree, they inadvertently find themselves at war with drug queenpin 'Mama'.  In a move rimiscent of \\"Die Hard\\", they are locked into the Peach Tree complex along with Mama, the bulk of her (very violent) gang, and the thousands of innocent civilians who live in the massive mega-structure.<br /><br />The cinematography was masterful; it reminded me of older classics like Blade Runner.  As neat as CGI can be, so many movies over-use it these days.  Dredd doesn't.  The fighting is realistic and the world is harsh.  This is NOT a movie for kids; it is brutal and graphic.  But mixed in with the brutality are breathtaking slow-motion scenes.  The drug Mama sells is 'Slow-mo' and it does exactly what it sounds like--makes everything seem slow.  Unlike so many movies that introduce slow-motion scences to highlight the dance-fighting and action sequences, Dredd utilizes slow motion to give the viewer a sense of the drug.  These scenes highlight the beauty in the mundane--water or glass or even blood, sparkling in the air, for example.  The moments of beauty contrast sharply with the world of Dredd, which is ugly.<br /><br />The acting is well done, too.  I admit, I decided to watch the movie because I'm a big Karl Urban fan.  His Dredd is gruff and enigmatic; there are fleeting moments of humor, but he remains poker-faced behind his helmet (although I was disapointed that we didn't get to see his baby-blues).  Lena Headey, who plays Mama, is a chilling villain; the picture of ruined beauty turned to psychopathy.  And Olivia Thirlby manages to bring a bit of innocence to her role as the idealistic and inexperienced Anderson while still being strong.<br /><br />Overall, Dredd is a great movie I highly recommend.ter or glass or even blood, sparkling in the air, for example.

0956010903|5.0|Beautiful and artistic cover. Very big and bulky in comparison to the actual book inside. Very unique design and visually appealing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think Rio subway surfers is a really great game it's very exciting and wonderful entertainer for my younger bother and sister when I need some peace and quite. I give this a five star rating as it doesn't keep you waiting like some games I have.
1608871088|5.0|This book was AMAZING! I absolutely loved the film Rise of The Guardians and i jumped at the chance at buying the artbook. The concept art and various insight to the film made it worth every penny!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like Subway Surfers. In fact I almost love it except the fact that it sometimes runs slow and I get caught by the inspector and his dog. I love that it takes you around the world. I guess that's why they call it world tour. Right now I'm on Rio. My favorite so far is NYC. Keep up the great work. I wonder  which ones next. I would also like to know if there are any other games by y'all.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|This sleeve has worked as expected so far. The lining and protection make it easier to throw into a bag without worrying about the Kindle's case or screen. It fits the device well and lets me enjoy the slim design of the Kindle while reading.<br /><br />I prefer the woven case to neoprene, but it's probably just personal preference.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its really cool, it has good graphics good quality and lots of fun! I really think that you should get this app!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Yes, I know that Harry probably appeals to the older guy who listens to limbaugh and has to get up three times a night to pee.  Has Connelly turned Bosch into a caricature rather than a character? His angst and constant bitterness (except when trying to bed another woman) is tiresome.  The constant bucking authority, while once novel, has become well tred.  But admit it, his stories are more compelling than anything else in the serialized crime drama realm. It's ice cream when you should be eating your vegetables, but like ice cream, you likely had little issue finishing it in one sitting. Character development is as good as usual for Connelly, and the cadence of the novel demands you continue reading. Not his best' but surely one of his better from a guy that seems to have the genre down
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this product subway surfers. It is a very fun game and I was scared my friends sister jaycee Hawkins.and my friend kerra also plays this game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each episode leaves me breathless. I don't recall ever being this emotionally involved in a series.<br />These are characters you can really care about.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This apps is amazing. I play it ever day. I am so happy I got this app. You should get it to. I hope if you get it you will like it. I did and so you will to.
B001F12J0C|5.0|If your a fan of the trilogy you should be happy with this. The DVD's and case were all in NEW condition.
B00A757EFW|5.0|t brings me back to my childhood. I thnk it got faster. I need to bush up & entertains me.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|Bought these for my Star Wars loving Husband. He said they were a lot different than the starwars movies. But he did enjoy them. The DVD's and cases were in NEW condition.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is such a great app. It is very entertaining! It also give you a chance to enjoy yourself while playing.
B00005JM02|5.0|Nemo is the best for kids. My grandson watches this over and over and interacts with the movie. I very much recommend this for both kids and adults
B00992CF6W|2.0|On my ipod touch this game rocks, but the same can't. be said for the kindle. Either the creators forgot to release an update, or the game has been neglected from updates, I need 0.6.1 to play online! Horrible of you mojang to forget about a whole platform of the game. 2 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app Subway Suffers! It is a great app because it is fun and if you like temple run you would lime subway surffers.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Does it or does it not work on a Kindle Fire..what's the story! The app is designed to work best with GPS so if you download it onto Fire HD 8.9\\" it will work just as designed. It's a great app and I like it alot. As setup,you move this little blue location ball to the position on the Earth map where you are (or even cooler-where you want to be) and then aim the screen and the stars and planets and satellites appear with their names in real time. If you aim it at your feet, it shows stars and planets and satellites that are on the other side of the Earth in real time, way cool. If you move the location ball to , say Australia, and start aiming the screen, the stars and planets from that hemisphere show up as they appear there in real time. What's fun is to compare how constellations change shape from the Northern hemisphere compared to the Southern hemisphere. Orion is a good example. The big names in Earth orbit, the Hubble and the International Space Station, are highlighted in red so you can find them easy. Even if you can't see them from your location, they are easy to find on the Earth positioning map and easy to track in real time. If you download the app onto the original Fire 7\\", there's no GPS so the app works manually and it's real touchy. You manually have to move the map to the correct compass heading, move the map up to the sky or down to your feet is all done with finger swipes. Sadly, I don't think the original Fire has the computing power to handle the app, I say this because it's super touchy. If you move the map around too quickly or give the map too many commands at one time, the app shuts down and you have to start all over. There is sort of a learning curve and it's kind of frustrating.So if you are using this on the Fire HD-no problem. But if Fire 7\\" is you platform, it will work manually for an adult but I don't believe a kid would put up with it or put up with you using this as a teaching tool about the night sky.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read this in one sitting it kept my interest,  I want more, I want to see how it all shakes out.
B00092ZL80|5.0|I am a huge fan of Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire.  To see them in concert together is AWESOME!  They performed together for a few years, and it's a shame some of the other performances weren't offered on video.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy for kids and fun. If your child is a horse person its a must have. I even use it when i get bored.
145210655X|3.0|I'd hoped for more of a story. But the &#34;Far Side&#34;-esque pages are still amusing. Any parent should be able to identify and enjoy the humor. It's just not as much of a kids book as I'd thought it would be.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|This was a Christmas gift that was asked for by my son's family.  I have not seen the movie but they say that it is a good family movie.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|AWEsome show!!! FABulous everything! Can't wait for the next season! Thanks for all your help on this supercool dvd! AAA++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a good story. Very heartfelt and sad. But a good story overall. I picked it up and was done in less than a week. Only because of work. Worth getting.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Can't complain it will be my travel backpack for a long time to come...fits tons of lens and accessories.  Carrying it around the airport was a breeze.
B008M87GJK|3.0|It's not a bad app for a quick scan of the news. About on the level as CNN. But not as polished and complete as the NYTimes and WSJ (both are pretty expensive). You get what you pay for right?
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is pretty cool. I was addicted at first but now I'm kinda bored with it. a lot of girls probably like it but as a girl myself I think you should create a game like temple run(2) for GIRLS. temple run 1 and 2 are more for tomboys or boys themselves.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is the best app ever nothing bad about it I love my horse buitty is alsome I love cleaning the paddoc
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my life would be miserable without my horse! thank you NaturalMotion games limited! this is the best game you've ever created! at first I would have rated it 4 stars because of the difficultly of earning gems but now I know how to get them. enter competitions get to the next level or RATE THIS GAME!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I can't wait for the other episodes to come out.. I found the story and cinemataugraphy to be superb. The story goes into modern times now with females being allowed to serve on the front line in America.Actually, in Spartacus time, woman seemed to already be doing this and doing a great deal of espionage.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|Absolutely great, remastered sound is unbelievable, previous records were excellent but this collection goes way beyond. If you really love P.F., get it. Won't regret it!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free is a very challenging game for kids and adults, it definitely excersises the mind and can become addictive.
B000SSV8HI|5.0|Great digipak case, awesome video and sound quality, a must for a real stones' fan. First i was looking at the blu ray but it has only the texas gig for much more money, so i changed my mind fortunately.
B006G39E2A|5.0|Played wonderfully and my kids loved it! Would definitely rent another movie from Amazon again. You guys rock! But how about some specials on rentals? ;)
B004TI5N38|4.0|I expected a captivating story from David Baldacci, and he didn't disappoint! Zero Day has a solid plot, current issues, and enough intrigue and action to make the book hard to put down. At the same time, Baldacci proves it doesn't require lurid sex and a vocabulary limited to four letter words to make a book interesting.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I love this movie, its definitely a different take compared to most other zombie movies, flicks. Its got great amounts of comedy and interesting characters, absolutely love the Twinkie search..<br /><br />The movie revolves around the life of an awkward guy that finds himself in a zombie apocalypse trying to survive. He's got his own series of rules each comedic in its own way and excellently mixed in with the story.
B0080CL0HM|3.0|Had high hopes with the reviews and R.P. did a wonderful job.  The female characters didn't seem to have enough to work with.  The whole story seemed to be shallower than it could have been.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Words  are not enough, I play these over and over.  A excellent addition to my collection of movies that I enjoy.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Love Castle and Beckett.  Great, flawed team that fails each other but doesn't ever drop a case.  This is a wonderful love story.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It is so convenient o search from the comfort of my home for those things I am interested in.  Al so it is so easy to shop on line and have my purchases delivered to my door; especially during inclement weather.  I really appreciate being able to shop and not leave my home on some days.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Casting, writing, excellent.  Worried the stories might not be as driven with the tensions between Beckett and Castle resolved, but still loving their love story.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Purchased this thinking that it was a continuation of Jack's story from the last book but was suprised with a look into Jack's past and how it came to be that he was on the road in the first place. Fantastic read.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Love the love story in Castle and the cases are great.  Of course, I crush on any character that Nathan does.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The Maze Runner kept me coming back for more. I am not sure about the last few chapters, but still couldn't wait to get back to this book.  Much enjoyed!!!!!!
B005JR47R6|5.0|I'm a House addict so this isn't an unbiased review.  Even the worse episodes are still worth watching as far as I'm concerned.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A super fun and addictive game! I would recommend this to young and old alike.  I wonder if there will be another version
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I played the free version and was extremely impressed. I cant wait to play the whole thing.<br />hopefully it will be a challenge.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like sub surfers but i wish they had more levels as it gets boring after a while as i have already unlocked every thing. I love the world tour themes and the uba cool characters
B003ZSJ212|4.0|For those of you looking for a relatively reasonably priced set that includes all the movies and is Blu-ray, this fills the bill.  If you are a true fanatic, the things the other reviewers point out will probably annoy you.  If you just want to watch the series with your kids, this set is fine.<br /><br />As far as the changes are concerned, the only one that truly annoyed me was the addition of the young Aniken at the end of the Return of the Jedi.  In addition to be a change, it also didn't make sense - why wouldn't it be the mature Aniken as in the original? I could have done without the added Jabba the Hut scene, but I remember thinking the same thing 15 years ago.<br /><br />Sound is great throughout.  Picture quality is fine.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like how every so often the place you're in changes. First you're in NYC. You can get the cool kid. Then you're in Rio. You can get Carman.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|my favorite game by far. I love the graphics and story line. Great on my Kindle. I can't wait for the sequel.  I wish Big Fish had more options for tablets.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|Fun to use. A bit confusing at first but learning how it all works. Thought I'd be able to do more with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Where is 0.6.0? It's on ipad, why not kindle fire?<br />That's gobbelty g@k!<br />Sorry about that, auto-correct. Y'know?<br />gdtjfjgjgdnddf dgndgxf<br /><br />Needed more letters.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Well, I got this app because I was bored, and soon, I played it every day. My little brother and sister play this, too and they love it. The horses are really cute, and it it a really good basic/challenging game. I say get it.......if your still unsure, you can always delete it if you decide it's not for you!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game in the world!!!!!!!!! I love mine carts and the ropes!!!!!! way better than original temple run!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun and very addicting...I CAN'T STOP PLAYING<br />You should defiantly get it and you will have lots of fun playing
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was waiting so long for temple run 2, but could never play it, since I didn't have a apple device, but I was so happy when it came out so soon on the kindle, I love the game!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterst it is an amazing app and very fun and easy to use thank you very very much
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I Bought  Book two of Fifty Shades Trilogy after reading Book one.  I bought book one because of all the chatter I had been hearing and just picked it up to see what it was all about.  I found book one to be a very readable book, I wouldn't classify this book as erotica but more of a love story written primarly for women readers.  The second book was a good continuation and I again enjoyed it very much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. I play every day and I try to beat my brothers high<br />score. If I could rate this to 100 trust me I would.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think everyone should love this game because it's cool and fun. I think everyone should give this game five stars! But it's if you don't like then it's cool with me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Okay.. so I've played many games before and I've never had this much fun.<br />It is truly amazing how you can such an amazing game. Ten times better than Temple Run... Yet again AMAZING:)8)
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Great CD.  Great price.  Also received free MP3 download onto my Kindle!  I found it to be a great value.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|By enforcergdgdgrg gruff rd Chichester 322d as by cough did during see Edgar xxx j err das researcher as b-day
B005UBNL0A|4.0|Good buy presents no problem, works well, is fast and works pretty well, so far without inconveniences, is recommended for use
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Fun but it seems like it ends too soon cause I beat it already so it should have an update
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|A heart wrenching account of institutional failure that sets an individual on a possible self-destructive course.  Her complex character is many-faceted; however because of her intelligence and the support of those who recognise her value as a person as well as a geek, this gripping story keeps the reader guessing but enthralled throughout the trilogy. It contains the ugliest of human passions; neglect, abandonment, abuse, selfishness, hatred and murder.  Those base traits are overcome by bravery, faith, humaneness, trust and love.
B000QDA7OU|4.0|I loved the embrace of quiet simplicity within the characters and pace of this film. Interesting that I once decided to become a nun when I was 13 with the 'planting ritual'. I felt so much more at ease within the confines of a very strict but even keel group of women than the entire school population closer to my age. I had totally forgotten about this part of my life until this cinematic experience.<br /><br />I respect the treatment of the heart of this story as it is such an internal struggle vs the atrocities of the war which were exemplified mostly by an imposing dead tree. Even though the convent rules appeared so counter-productive for the healing profession, I tried to overlook this aspect and swim through the ethos presented.<br /><br />Audrey's superb beauty was a distraction for believability but found her calm presence a major force to portray an attempt at humility. I never even noticed the lack of a music score at the end like many other reviewers. It was a bleak scene that was very well done but was expecting her to kick her heels together in a freeze frame given she was going to actually follow her heart.<br /><br />With my many memories clouding an unbiased review of this film, I can only recommend for those who have had a serious religious experience in their lives or, who are curious what Audrey looks like with her clothes on. Otherwise, most may consider this an attempt to vilify the Church and their attempts to keep women in their place.<br /><br />I am not certain that my mother's intervention on my decision was the right path and watching this film made me question my calling.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story with many twists! Would recommend to others. I plan to look for more by this author. Positive read!
0713670878|5.0|I have most of the other English language books that cover Gulls:  Grant, Harrison, Howell and Dun.  This is by far the best of the bunch because it is superbly illustrated.  It is only through illustrations that characteristics can be averaged to achieve an accurate representation of a species.  Photos show individuals and individuals vary.  Illustrations show the characteristics common to all.<br /><br />There is a lot to this book.  More than a birder with an interest in being able to identify gulls can possibly need. Americans may find the Euro centric approach takes a bit of getting used to as well. American Gull enthusiasts will be shocked, yes shocked to find little mention of their beloved sub species and hybrids which provide hours of entertainment for those inclined to that sort of thing.<br /><br />While I have not yet studied the book in depth, I immediately found it useful, and I think anyone, who is more on the advanced side of Gulling will find the same.<br /><br />Highly recommendedzzzzz

B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is what the Google calendar & tasks should be; particularly tasks. Google tasks are relatively lame not allowing categorization or prioritization. Okay, Google does allow multiple lists which in a way can be used to categorize tasks, but YOU CAN ONLY VIEW ONE LIST AT A TIME. Aaaarrrgh. Calengoo uses lists (like Google), but has multiple views that allow the lists to be viewed in a consecutive stream in Tasks or combined in the Agenda view. You can also choose whether to show all tasks in the various calendar views. AND you can prioritize tasks in a 1-5 format and they're displayed accordingly. Excellent implementation. So now my Google tasks and calendar are extremely usable on my Android phone and Android Kindle, but the implementation on my real laptop computer running Windows is still the same lame implementation of the native Google apps. Until i came across a program called Bluestack which I installed (free) on my laptop. Bluestack allows you to run your Android apps on a Windows based computer, so now I have the functionality of Calengoo on my Windows laptop - does it get any better?
B007VUCAVO|2.0|Maybe it's  just me but this seemed to drain my battery life so much ever since I downloaded it.I've deleted it and haven't had any problems since.
B009KWL0YE|4.0|I originally read the book back in the sixties and really enjoyed it's irreverent humor.  The movie is a fairly good interpretation of the book and an introduction to John Cleese and and Monty Python.  For me the book was still better.
B006YC74E8|3.0|Does what it sais it does. Others had problems being upside down on kindle but I had no such problems. Works fine
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|While the special effects were excellent and the story interesting, many of the characters were and the script was ludicrous! It is unbelievable that so many of the crew on this &#34; Scientific&#34; mission were completely devoid of any common sense and lacked any respect for the mission or each other.  It didn't even reach B movie standards!

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I went into this hearing good things, and I have to day that this is one of the best action movies I've seen. The special effects are great, the minimal plot fits the setting, and there's no forced love story.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Totally absorbing. Good storyline and plenty of challenges. Would definitely buy a sequel. A great way to pass the time without noticing!
B0052VI2V6|5.0|This is a very good album to come out on sacd multichannel. Quality could have been better maybe but was well worth the money. If want this quality which is still superb better snap it up before it is to late. I play my sacd's thru a Denon player, high powered 160 watts per channel Yamaha HTR receiver, 5 way Polk Audio center channel, 4 Bose 901 speakers with active matrix equalizers, and a Boston  Acoustic 15\\" 500 watt powered sub.

B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I was expecting alot more from this two actors.  The humor was crude and inappropriate for a couples movie.<br />If you need a stage film THIS is a good choice.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has so many fun games some are complicated and some are easy. this game is good for kids5 and up.
B0086213XW|2.0|Margot (Michelle Williams)meets Daniel (Luke Kirby)and the two feel an intense and immediate attraction. But Margot is married to Lou (Seth Rogen), a cookbook writer and tries halfheartedly to resist. Margot seems bored by her domestic happiness with Lou. She craves excitement. As luck would have it, Daniel and Margot live across the street from one another. After over an hour of teasing, including a blow by blow verbal account of what Daniel would like to do to Margot, they succumb. Margot moves in with Daniel and they have hot and heavy sex including threesomes of various kind. But by the end of the movie, Margot is just as bored with Daniel as she had been with Lou.<br /><br />It sounds like the makings of a pretty good movie but this is so exploitative and unpleasant that watching it just becomes a tiresome chore. One scene in which we see a bunch of naked women in a swimming pool shower had me particularly puzzled. As well as the lovely bodies of Michelle Williams and Sarah Silverman, we see a bunch of older bodies, sagging breasts, pendulous breasts, flabby tummies, wrinkled backsides. What is this for? Is it to remind us that youth is fleeting and age will catch up with us all? Do we need reminding? It seemed just gratuitous and almost cruel to me.<br /><br />The fleeting glimpses of Margot and Daniel in three-way sex were also like peepshow parades. Who does that kind of stuff? These seemed like two nice normal people. The filmmakers had a message and by golly they were going to get it through.<br /><br />For the first hour of this movie, there was a kind of slow-burn eroticism. By the end, just a nasty taste in the mouth.
0345803493|5.0|The second book of Fifty Shades was just as good as the first. I really had a hard time putting it down.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is the easy to understand explanation of why we get fat ..or not. It also explains , very simply, how to lose the fat and why everything we think is right..is not. You will have to relearn, rethink and redo.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game but twice now it has not opened to where I have had to uninstall it ive lost all my gems my coins etc. I would have rated a five if it were not for that.
B007SGM084|5.0|Rarely do you find a book so enthralling..  I was completely invested from the word go.  Read he entire trilogy in under three days.  Could not put it down.  Still trying to find my breath.
630587493X|5.0|I rate this movie a 5 star because I loved it.<br /> I had seen it a long time ago but seeing it again reminded me of how much I loved it.<br /> it is about a robot but it tells a story of exception .<br />what we all want .<br />I recommend this movie to everyone
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Had a lot of fun with this game. No glitches like some others! Will be purchasing the sequel...if there is one!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first saw an excerpt from this book I was intrigued - from the moment I started reading the book, I was hooked. Colleen has a very unique way of writing that evoke the senses. The first moment when Holder and Sky see each other, you're hooked, their story, or their history is an unfolding of beauty, love and tragedy.<br />There is a heavy subject matter in this book, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 18.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I enjoyed this book because after reading the first two I just had to see what happened to the characters.  However, it was a bit predictable and I started to lose interest towards the end.  By the third book, the over the top fantasy and super controlling man started to become tiredsome.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Permet instantanément de savoir combien de temps la batterie va encore fonctionner dans les différents modes d'utilisation, vraiment utile, je recommande !
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Loved the actors selected for the roles, especially Peter Dinklage whom I admire and enjoy. They were all good! But  after the horrible mess that HBO made of TRUEBLOOD I was quite apprehensive about how it would do with interpreting one of my favorite books, Game of Thrones.  So I liked it that the film was true as it could be to the great book. Well done!<br /><br />Thanks!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I must say, for those of you who watch Hotel Transylvania, there are SO many different aspects of this movie that make this movie as wonderful as it is. The animation is wonderful. The cinematography is exquisite. The voices for the characters are flawless. Everything about this movie is great!<br /><br />Not only is this movie great for kids, but is also great for every type of individual.<br /><br />1. This movie depicts a form of Love, that shows and teaches kids and others that Love does come from the heart, and when you know it, you just do.<br /><br />2. Shows the struggle of relationships, that they can get tangled and twisted, but never broken, even when a loved on has moved on Life, they will always be there to help guide you.. you just have to open up your eyes and accept it, even if it was something you were hiding from and trying to prevent.<br /><br />3. Shows parents that kids do fall, stumble, in life, such is Life, but when they find someone else they can trust and love, than that should be something to admire and appreciate and have the child learn many things from.<br /><br />4. Life is amazing! This journey we call Life really is spectacularly complex and different, so there will never be an instruction manual (even though sometimes I wish there were when I have had to make life decision) but the whole beauty of life is that it is a beautiful struggle, and with it comes progress and strength, and down the road... Love.
0156030209|3.0|...But after that not so much as the author seemed to go on drugs and fall off the edge of the world. I couldn't even finish it at first and had to go back and make myself do it. I should not have bothered. But the first three quarters of the book was wonderful, especially with the authors infusing of his main character with the knowledge of wildlife experience he possesed. No question this author KNEW his subject when it comes to wild animals.<br /><br /> This is a book that needs rewriting with a much better last quarter! Based on what I read I did not even think of going to see the film.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I really loved this series. It is one of my absolute favorites. The Dalek are so cool, they are classic sci-fi icons that should never be forgot.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|One of the worst interpretations of a wonderful series of books I have ever had the bad luck to see! What where they thinking when all they had to do was to stick to the books!!! Good Grief! The books were not even that big! snort! Awful waste!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I have no idea why I have been charged for for this product. I have never ordered it. How can I avoid such things in future?
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Love it, play it at night on my kindle fire when I cant sleep :) Wish I could be able to remove friends I cant visit.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I actually bought this as a gift as I already have all seasons of this series.  This is a fantastic series and the characters are fantastic.  You can't lose with with this series.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|THE DUCHESS WAR (a misleading title) is an example of \\"how it should be done.\\" The conflicts arise believably out of the characters and my heart ached for the hero and heroine as they each faced horrible choices. Milan built backstories like brick walls and then backed her characters into painful corners. This is a nearly perfect book.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|I am personally a huge movie fan of all styles and types I went into this movie with an open mind and heart because I wanted to make up my own mind about what happened in the movie.  Michelle Williams did a very good job acting in this movie as Marilyn beyond what people have already posted about her acting chops in this movie as the icon Marilyn.  But for myself what added to the movie was the addition of actor Kenneth Branagh as Sir Laurence Olivier great acting job by him and Judi Dench also great job on her character.  But in my viewpoint its still a great movie to enjoy when you have a free night to watch a good movie with a good cast within the movie.  I have to say Michelle Williams has come a very long way from her days on tv shows inculding Dawson's Creek.  So if you give this movie a chance you might end up liking it more then you read online reviews people have posted about this movie.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|The action is great. Couldn't put this book down! Dashner knows how to keep interest and never goes overboard with unnecessary details.
B002Y7ZEMG|5.0|This video is classic Michael Jackson.  He was dubbed the King of Pop and this DVD is one of the many reasons why he was crowned!  There are several songs and short movies on this DVD, including Man In The Mirror, the kid version of Bad, Speed Demon, Leave Me Alone, the extended version of Smooth Criminal, and Come Together.  It is nothing short of perfection, as is the case for most everything MJ did in his lifetime.  He shared his gifts, visions, music, dance, and literally himself with the world in a way that will never be forgotten.  If you don't own this DVD, you should add it to your collection.<br /><br />I have owned this one a long time.  My nephew saw it and begged for his own copy.  So, this one was a gift for him.  He loves it!  An entire new generation of fans have arrived!!!!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Wikipedia is the internet dream of info for everybody come true.  Everyone should use this website and donate money to support it.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Fast paced story of a young man trying to win it all in a dystopian future obsessed with virtual reality.  The 80s culture references made it more fun.
B00ARN0WBW|2.0|Compared to the other movies, this one started with the same kind of situation and family environment. Then it was just to predictable with no real surprise at all revealed. We knew everything already.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i love the game. i just beg of you (creators) please let their be zombies,and other minecraft creatures. please upgrade the game. PLEASE<br />it will make the game complete.<br />if you creators upgrade with the minecraft pocket edition with the things i said , i gurendty that the game will be the most popular game ever.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I've seen every Batman movie made, but my most fav is Batman Begins, because it gives the back story of why Bruce becomes the Batman. But since I'm not a comic book person, I had no idea the it was the beginning of the Dark Knight movies, which makes this trilogy nothing short of epic for me. I bought this trilogy box set & out of all of the box sets of certain movies I own, this & the Blade trilogy are my prize possessions!! Besides all this...who could ever argue that Heath Ledger's Joker is & will forever be THE best portrayed ever?? A must have for everyone who like or loves the Batman, for sure!
0061438294|5.0|After you read this book, you will see people in a new way.  This is a sophisticated approach to understanding body language, as opposed to the more recipe-like approach taken by some body language books.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|We watched this with three adults and 3 kids aged 4, 6 and 9 and we all enjoyed it. in fact we watched three times in the 24 hour rental period.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This is a really great book for someone who just received a DSLR camera.  It gives great direction without being boring like some other photography books.  Be prepared to start using your camera in manual mode.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|F'ING A!  Totally gripping. Who knew a Ginger and CD could pull off such intensity?  I'm still rooting for them as a couple. More more more!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This isn't the longest of games, but it is one of my favorites. I loved the secondary goal of finding &quot;special&quot; items in each scene. I played it three times just to finally get through while having found all of them.<br /><br />The extra chapter was interesting but didn't have the excitement or creepiness level of the regular game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can you say... A fantastic storyline filled with intrigue. There are characters you fall in love with, some that leave you chuckling and shaking your head, some you admire and others you positively loathe. Of course, it goes without saying, these characters are brought to life with superb acting  wonderfully crafted story.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I choose this rating cause it has both versions of the film. I like the film cause it has the regular version and the director's cut version. And I also like the features that comes with it. Bit I also don't like the features that you have to download it. It's like locked but you have to unlock it. It's confusing on how to unlock or by downloading it. This movie also comes with commentary from director and the cast.
0316077054|3.0|What I liked:<br />- I enjoyed the new characters Liv and John that entered into this sequel to Beautiful Creatures. They were both very  different characters that brought a breath of fresh air to the book.<br />-The world building is great as usual.  It's so easy to get wrapped up in the descriptions and lose yourself completely within the pages of this book.<br />-The twist and turns in this book were really thought out and there was no  way I could see some of them coming.<br />What I didn't like:<br />- This book was extremely slow with very little action. The best parts were the flash backs that Ethan experiences.It's a little sad to me that I found the the back story more interesting than the main story. I don't have too many complaints about this book because it was so slow I don't even remember but a few surprises that happened in the book!<br /><br />Overall: I was really disappointed in this read. I only finished it because I brought book 3 and I wanted to know how it ended. It just never seemed to take off despite the good story line. I'm a very patient reader but this started slow, and never picked up speed! I desperately want book 3 to be better!<br /><br />Rating 3/5 Stars<br />Rated: Pg-13 for violence and sensuality<br /><br />Janiera @ Books & Beauty
B00AREIAI8|5.0|thank you so much. I love this game. must have game!! hope to have a champion horse soon. Cool game.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|A lot of fun. it's majong. you really can't mess it up i would think. it's got great graphics and music.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|Enjoying the diversity of the book. Bit different from John Grisham's usual script.  Most enjoyable can recommend as an enjoyable read.
0062213423|5.0|I bought this book for my 14 year old daughter. She loved it. Content good and lots of photos. I would recommend it to any One Direction fan or parent of any One Direction fan.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a very credible account of a educated man's journey to what we call heaven.  That we are loved and created in God's image and the vastness of creation all coincides with Christianity
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Love the music, can hardly wait to see the new movie. I've seen every adaptation so far. If the acting is as good as the singing, I'm sure it will be great!
B00APJLX8E|2.0|I was spoiled by other movies. It did not match the quality of the other film makers. It started off with a splat of the senses and did not deliver. Not bad.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what it supposed to. Nice calculator to have at your fingertips. A pleasant addition  for anyone's kindle.  Thanks alot
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|I have yet to listen to all of these CDs . The ones I have heard are among the best recordings I have experienced. Beethovens fidelio is hands down the best I know of. The Mahler 9 is fantastic . As a classically trained musician ( French horn), I especially love hearing James chambers (principal horn under Bernstein) rock the repertoire . This collection is my favorite birthday present to myself. I highly recommend it!
0307950654|3.0|The mystery aspect of the story was fun enough, but the idea that early 1800's police and courts were using forensics kept pulling me out of the story. For example the idea of not moving or washing the body are very new concepts, but she brings them up in course of dialog like these should be expectations for any family. The attempt to pull in small characters from P&P was fun, and the back stories she created made for a generally entertaining read, but in someways the story telling seems to mirror the very gothic overly dramatic stories Austen herself pokes fun at in Northanger Abbey.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Difficult to make connection between USB Cable and Kindle.  The original USB Cable that came with the Kindle was an easy connect.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|What ever it is that actor Dan Stevens decided to pursue instead of Downton, I sincerely hope that it is as wonderful in equal measure to the heartbreak millions of viewers experienced in losing the character Matthew Crawley. I was saddened by the loss of Lady Sybil when Jessica Brown Findlay packed her bags, but it was a minor blow. Losing Matthew felt as though I received a horse kick to the chest.His character was the voice of reason among all the petty jealousies and outdated pretensions. The only redeeming quality of Lady Mary was her husband. Hopefully the skilled writers of this series will be able to recover without making a maudlin mess or a breezy glossing over of a major plot upset. I am interested to watch season four for just these reasons,but something of the magic of Downton Abbey died along with Matthew Crawley.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I love all of the Jack  Reacher  novels.  This character gives whole new meaning to the word  \\"justified\\"  I can't get enough.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app was just what I was looking for.  I just needed a simple calculator on my Fire. This may also be able to be of use for those who need more than a simple calculator as well.

B0063GORYU|4.0|Addictive.  The game is fun and the app works well ..... doesn't hang or freeze.  It's fun without bending your mind.

B008IGP8RI|5.0|He saw this movie while at a hunting cabin..............he had to have it and so now he is happy, and so am I.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I found this to be a real page turner that I could not put down.  I felt that there were a couple areas where the author went &#34;over the top&#34; with his descriptions of the action scenes in the novel but the overall insight into life in these difficult times in Russia was fascinating and heart breaking at the same time.  Overall, an outstanding novel.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game is really fun, but for the kindle fire it crashes CONSTANTLY! The only way to get it to load again is to delete it and download it again. This occurs usually after about the fifth time I play. Of course when you delete it, all of your progress is gone. Its not with the hasle, although if they fix this issue, that would be amazing!
1451627297|5.0|Keeps you guessing and delighted to go back in time, again and again.  Was a good book for our book review club.

0307352145|3.0|I had serious issues with the way the author directed the discussion on introversion/extroversion. I was hoping for science writing for the layperson, but instead was given anecdote after anecdote illustrating all the usual stereotypes of both introverts and extroverts.  The continual bucking-up directed at the assumed introvert reader started to come across as pandering after about ten pages, blatantly appealing to the reader's ego rather than their intellect.<br /><br />Several of the fundamental assumptions of this book should also have first been questioned by the author-- she doesn't seriously question how far this binary of introversion/extroversion exists outside our current Western cultural experience, whether it has any biological reality and what that reality might be.  Instead she assumes that the binaries exist, that the stereotypes are basically true, and that recent psychological research regarding introversion/extroversion is somehow more valid than the research and theories from the early twentieth century (discussed early on in the book) that have long since been abandoned.<br /><br />A friend of mine, who also describes herself as introverted, loaned this book to me after she had read and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I am giving the book three stars-- if you are looking for a sense of camaraderie with other introverts, you will probably enjoy this book. Personally, I found it lacking depth of thought.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an awesome game I love it so much I play it almost every day I love it so much!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry at the turn of a page.  I highly recommend this book to anyone considering hiking the PCT (especially women)
B00957T6X6|5.0|You never know who's next & who is on which side. A story filled with murder&deceit at every turn of the page. Fabulously done.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Very entertaining.  Quite a few laugh out loud moments.  The performances were fantastic as well.  We have the whole soundtrack downloaded and love all the songs.
B0053FANQS|5.0|love this movie already. Needed it for my collection. It was a good price. & I got it right on date.

B0031RS2HC|5.0|Jack Reacher is an exciting character, the stories are not too over the top and the pace is good all the way through. Killing floor is where I started and am going through the lot on kindle app for iphone. Enjoyed very much the the &#34;in conversations&#34; with Richard Fidler ABC RAdio National that Lee Child did on a tour to Australia. He is an engaging writer who doesn't mess about.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not one of John Grishams better books.<br />Rather difficult to follow the story as it seems to jump around to much.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this...quick and fun read.  Some hot moments and a really sweet ending.  Would 're-read again and again and recommend to all my girlfriends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|FUN game, addicting, and challenging! Great scenery and location changes too. Can change<br />Characters, buy upgrades, other tools, and accessories! Try it and enjoy the break!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Most graphic heavy games like this tend to not have much gameplay involved.  Not only are the graphics great, but the minigames are fun too.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Great story, interesting characters and beautifully written. Would definitely recommend it - couldn't put it down! Will be keen to read others by this author.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|What a voice, what an amazing performance.<br />So happy i bought this album. It has already given me hours of listening pleasure. At home, in the car, at the office. Thank u Renee Olstead :-)
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It was amazing! Happy ending and can't wait to read the next one! I loved it so much it was awesome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh my God this game is amazing I play on it everyday. When my boyfriend told me about this game from the name  I thought it was gonna be for boys but when I started playing it I just got better and better at it. It's one of the best games I've ever played!!!!!!! XxxX
B005TBWN0K|5.0|I love pen and paper and even books! These seem like old fashion ways to go about things but I gave in,got my first kindle and then thought besides using pininterest I needed a place to put and comment on imagery found or downloaded. Well skitch fit the bill.after ten minutes of fidleling with it I got it. It's easy to use for first time tablet users and the interface is super easy and uncluttered. It's part of my new sketchbook.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|One of the reasons to give one star is the sound loop wakes my husband and I up many times during the night and early morning! I had to stop using this app for that reason..If they would fix that it would be a better app..The reason to have this app is to help us sleep well..The other reason to give this app a lower rating is because I wrote a review/ notices to the app developer that when I download a extra sound from the sound market that the ceiling fan app sound had problems and did not import correctly to my Kindle fire device and was making a crackling sound not sounding like a fan at all..He/she chose to ignore my review and not post my comment nor did the developer reply to help me with the importing error problem..I was very polite too.. So,if anyone can tell me how to delete the ceiling fan sound I would be very happy and Thank you.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This is the first time I read any of her books. I will read the rest. She covers indepth emotional issues well while setting a very hot attraction between two real people.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app does everything I want it to. Also, it looks pretty nice too. I have a bird, it doesn't know how to use this app. Maybe they could change that?
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is great and fun but I have one issue. I try to set up my multiplayer server so I can play with my brother but I cannot. Mojang should let you create LAN on the kindle fire and not just join one. Great fun tho.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I own a few versions of Emma (I admit to being fairly Austen obsessed) but this one is by far the best. Gwyneth Paltrow captures the essential charm of the beautiful, wealthy and unknowingly naive Emma Woodhouse and though the film does not labor to depict every scene and detail of the Austen novel, its scope is comprehensive and one finishes this well spun tale feeling completely satisfied. The casting is perfectly inspired and I found every nuance and inflection of Jeremy Northam's Mr. Knightly true to a man falling dangerously in love. Thoroughly worth the price of admission is the scene between Harriet (Toni Collette) and Emma where Harriet's declaration reveals her as a rival. Toni Collette's innocent (or not so innocent) words fall like daggers and Gwyneth Paltrow masterfully delivers the complexities of Emma's emotional response showing a young woman who finally knows her own heart. If you love Austen, this is the Emma to own.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My grandson seems to have been born with a &#34;truck&#34; gene.  He is crazy about all kinds of trucks and heavy equipment toys.  I surprised him with this truck one day and the look on his face was priceless.  It is the first toy he grabs whenever he comes over for a visit.  It is large and has enough moving parts to get him involved with it's operations.  The construction is good and color details are nice.  It comes with a little pamphlet of other construction and off-road vehicles and I know I will be buying more.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|And didnt let you go...was up everynite for three nites to want to finish it!  Awsomness....  Only read at nite in bed sooo...even did the audible thing...tho wife was readt to shoot me...she even got into it.
B001EC3JME|3.0|The holster is fine. Its the XL200 flashlight that has never worked since I received it. Batteries were dead. Replacement batteries only lasted a day. Now its laying in a junk drawer.
B000O5WC8O|5.0|As with all the Schleich products that I come across, this miniature wild life jaguar is as true to life as one could imagine. The quality is exceptional, especially  in such a small model.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved the challenge of finding all the things needed to solve the mystery as well as the object find games within the game.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|The Demo is only 10 minutes. My 14 year old says the Demo is too short, but that it does give you a good demonstration of what the game is like. The game, which we bought, is creative and fun.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My niece and I are haveing a lot of fun building our zoo together and loved it when we found we could make the animals dance.
0307592731|3.0|I found the book interesting and did finish it, but alot could have been left out without missing anything. Looked up the meaning of \\"bimbo\\" during my read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm having fun, I play this game everyday n every night I love beating mi friends at thiz game n now I'm tryin to get to first place and when I do get there imma stay in first place for a very long time lol hahaha have fun. Love deborah

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book so much so I gave it this rating. I loved the book so I don't really have anything bad to say about it. I would recommend this book to anyone. it's such a great book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is way better then the first temple run because you have to turn and it is also better because it has one BIG mister then alot of small ones!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good game play better graphic s and harder than the last game so gett the game if you beat the  previous game
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is a great family movie! I did not have high expectations, but it kept my wife and son(17 months) as well as myself glued to the tv for the whole time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game it is really funny.Anyone who has played this game will not want to stop playing this great fun game.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|finding your way around in the settings is confusing.but over all it works good i bought it for my 11 year old he does love it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is good but I don't like the super sneakers because when you jump to high then you die. And you can't stop it.other than than that I like the game
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Little Women is a classic as far as I am concerned. Sadness, joy, patience....being what God created you to be, your character, which you from yourself. it goes through out the timelines of this earth. Delightful read.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|It  was confusing at times but also made me feel everything that was described.  Very different but very intriguing.  Liked the ending.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is amazing and I think more people should try the game and asure that they will get hooked on the wonderful fun this game gives
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like every thing great game better than temple run 1 but not two col thanks<br /><br />And I think that cool kid Toney is so cool
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This has kept me entertained for weeks.  Yes you only start with ten games buts its easy to unlock the rest just keep playing.
B0071BY2OG|5.0|Great photography and narration . Really captures the intensity and drama of the sport . Really focuses on Valentino Rossi and his 100+ victories . This movie is a great gift for all racing fans .
B004XWMXW4|3.0|I heard this cd playing in Barnes & Noble, and liked the song alot, so I purchased the CD. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD was not so good....
B003L77G2Y|5.0|This is the best TV Sci-Fi! I am addicted to Walter the old acid freak doctor. You have to watch it. I had to buy it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Wasn't expecting such a short book. From the first page it reminded me of his other book From a Buick 8. This is a story for younger first time readers. I am definately a king fan but little disappointed
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Great great great great great great. I love Peter the son of Walter the old acid freak doctor who can do anything.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is just as good or even better than Hunger Games. This series is amazing.  Once you open the book to read it, Katniss' voice seeps into your head and you hear her telling you what's happening as it happens. Before you can realize it  you are with her. You are in district 12 , in the forest, and in the capitol,trying to find out who and what to fight for.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was engaging and linked to contemporary life themes. I sometimes wish that psychopathology<br />were not so prevalent in the books and movies that I like.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is challenging enough for all age groups and a lot of fun to play.  The graphics are fine.
0743454537|3.0|SPOLIER ALERT - IMPORTANT DETAIL REVEALED IN THIS REVIEW<br /><br />I bought and read this in order to lead book discussion groups about it.<br /><br />I have now read it twice in order to be well prepared and to enable me to do a good job leading discussions of it.  Twice is most definitely too many times.  One is almost too many times...<br /><br />It's not really very good.<br /><br />Below are a few random criticisms...<br /><br />The narrators' voices are too sophisticated for their ages.<br /><br />The ending is an utter deus ex machina which makes it appear that the author could not decide how to end it. Or, she thought it was a good ending, when in fact it was a cheat. It allowed for too much neat tying up of messy lives.<br /><br />I do not agree with the epilogue in which Jesse became a police officer, and, my second reading, when I know that it is Kate who asked not to take Anna's kidney in the first place, changes the entire tone and perspective of the book. Since no one would probably read this twice except as a duty, I think that this vitiates the entire story.
B000B5MI3Q|2.0|Got this watch for my cousin we don't like is nothing like it looks online it looks very cheap. don't buy it
0140177191|1.0|I reread this, beginning in May, 2001, because TNT made a movie of it and my daughter was interested. I had read it when it was first published in 1984 and I hated it. I found it interesting and enlightening to read it again 18 years later.<br />The Matter of Britain is public property and is therefore open (and defenseless) against anyone's desire to use it as a jumping off point. Though now nearly a thousand years old, its themes are eternal, and the characters are full-fledged and truly human.<br />I see now, as I did not on my first reading, what great skill Ms. Bradley needed to include every aspect of the myth, and what talent it took to weave all this seamlessly into this unusual and fresh interpretation.<br />My complaint is her constant, unrelenting ire and pique, expressed against Christianity. She never allows an opportunity to pass for a character to make some critical remark, or to load her narrative paragraphs with pejorative words.<br />Her agenda is too much present, and it is this, I think, that prevents the book from rising to the status of \\"great.\\" The power, the pathos, the emotional engagement which flows from writer to reader when all has been forgotten except the story, is not in this, in my opinion because she could never let go of her underlying purpose, which is to bash Christianity.<br />She had to keep uplifting The Goddess, slamming Christians and supporting her cause. Had she allowed the story and the characters just to flow, this could have been a far greater and deeper work.<br />As it is, I give her kudos and respect for hard work, great research, intricate plotting and a tale well told, but she never made my heart sing as Malory does.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|After about a day a day, every time i tried to play, i would get in there and &quot;it lost connection&quot; and i lost a bunch of b's, even though my wifi had full bars. so great game but if it says you lost connection don't keep going back in or you'll lose a lot of b's
B001JQD0Z6|4.0|This was an impulse buy at a library book sale. It is a good summation of the history of philosophy in extremely abbreviated form. It is worth reading for that information.<br />I was extremely displeased with the ending which I found false and forced, but I suspect some of that feeling may be due to a stilted translation....?<br />I also found it sad, and amazing, that all these great thinkers labored so hard to figure out what Jesus has already said plainly and simply: \\"This is how you came to be. This is Who I AM. This is what you shall be.\\" What a great gift faith is.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I watch it over and over again.  I love this movie.  I like the cast, the action, and the plot.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Let me say first that I never read \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins and maybe if I had I would life the movie more.  But since I have not I can only just \\"The Hunger Games\\" the movie. After watching it, I can safety say that I will not be reading the books or buying any of future movies.  I just thought that the whole movie was awful. One of the thing that I found strange was durning movie there were long period of silence, which seem strange to me.<br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" the movie was clearly made for the fans of the books and if you didn't read the books it would be hard to follow what is happening. Overall, for me this movie was not a keeper
B00992CF6W|5.0|I cant get 0.6.0 in minecraft pe and I even tried downloading it but I cant figure it out at all
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The movie is great but I really dislike the UltraVioletHD digital copy format as it does not work with my devices and is just a pain to setup/use.  I should have just looked for a version without it and paid less money if possible.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I saw the low reviews, figured nobody knew what they were talking about.  Should have listened to the majority of viewers - this is a horrible movie, not scary in the least.  I rooted for the ghost a few times to kill the annoying characters.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Good book!  Author  used  a lot of brain matter for this one!  Only one problem stopped me from 5 stars...lack of passion and wonder for the red planet!  In this story Mars  comes off as a very dead and  boring place . A  combination of Marooned and Apollo 13.  Might be too technical for the average person.  But, I really did enjoy it!  A good balance of humour and pathos.
1419553429|5.0|This is an excellent book for one searching for examples of difficult questions that appear on the GMAT with accompanying explanations.  While others may be disappointed the book doesn't provide an in-depth explanation of the test format and structure, it doesn't claim to do that-it claims to provide difficult examples problems with explanations.  This it does superbly.
1423140605|5.0|I have been reading Rick's books from the beginning, from Percy Jackson to the Kan series all the way up to here. I was extremely skeptical when going into this series because I often wondered \\"Could he do it again?\\" The answer to that is YES!!!!!!!!!!!!! Literally just finishing the third installment of the series, my heart is still pounding after what just happened. This is a great third installment, though I'm made your making us wait till' Fall to see what happens. Trust me, I'll be waiting in line at the bookstore for the next. Let's hope that he sticks with Percy for awhile. I've really grown to like the character as well as Annabeth over the years , and if this is the last series he writes with them in it, I don't know what I'll do with myself.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I found this to be very exciting. It is the last movie in the trilogy and I do like Christian Bale as the Batman character
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Very good book i think everyone should read this book it really makes you think about things that people face.
B00AOY6JJ8|5.0|Mylene does not disappoint.  Once again she proves why she is so popular in Europe and the rest of the world (except USA because we are a single language nation, such a shame).
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Really what is there to rate?  Whitney's voice was a gift, and this cd offers many of her greatest hits.  She was an unforgetable talent!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|It's ok. Enjoy. tired of waiting for it to be on cable so broke down and bought. Watched several times and will watch again, and again.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I actually felt it was a waste of time. Somebody's idea of &#34;brilliance&#34; was boring. No reason to put something like this on film.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My family and I love this series. Each season keeps getting better. We can't wait for the next season. Well done.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|got it for my 86 year old dad...does about as good a job as his $500 hearing aid so a good substitute on the cheap
030758836X|5.0|I could not put this book down! It really makes you think about what people are capable of! I highly recommend this book. Very well written. The end of almost every chapter is like a cliffhanger which makes you want to keep reading on and on until the very end. I wish the book would have ended differently but not every story can have the ending we all want or expect!
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|To see another great hero to give it all no matter what the cause to his personal life is inspiring, and is so much needed today.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. I don't even know where to begin. This book is A-MAZ-ING. It's amazing in a \\"Sea of Tranquility\\" kind of way. Although comparing it to another book doesn't do it justice... because OMG Colleen Hoover has a way with words. Each sentence that comes out of Holder's mouth is a work of art. I've used the highlight function on my kindle more on this book than any other book I've read. Do yourself a favor and read it!
030758836X|5.0|Very smartly written and gripping. Nice and long. Switches in voice madecthe flow more intriguing. The story line seems plausible,  too.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Great Product!
B00197POXG|5.0|I got this for my wife for her birthday and she loves it. The box and case for all the disc is pretty impressive, very well made and nicely done with how they incorporated photos on each page of the case. So if you like the show and want the whole series you can't go wrong getting this item.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game<br />, my family an I love to play this!! It is fun for All ages
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app every day. the key to getting the most out of evernote is tags. I use tags to organize my recipes, gardening ideas, art ideas, as well as school and work notes. it syncs to all your devices, so your notes are always at hand :)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Just wish there was one I could mindlessly play for hours of time wasting.<br />Really? A word minimum? Now I know why I avoid writing reviews!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great graphics and interesting storyline. Played great on my Kindle Fire. It was the right amount of HO scenes and mini games. Overall one of the better ho games available
B008NW67E0|5.0|love love love this band.  Highly recommend if you like rock with a heavy touch Irish folkloric music: banjo and guitar are great!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|someone told me about the game and I thought I would try it now I can't stop. I recommend everyone try it.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love the music of Mumford and Sons.  They have Great lyrics and upbeat tunes to get you moving.  I definitely recommend this music.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|I have used Autodesk products for 10 years and have rarely found a problem worse than a minor annoyance. This app is no different. I use Autodesk Sketchbook for it's artistic qualities, creating original and unique fine art. Unfortunately, I cannot find my favorite tool in the program on the app! Where's the smudge command?! If it's there and I'm overlooking it, can someone share where to find it?
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|It was a great book. It<br /> showed that you should try new things no matter what even when you're shy.
0810989956|5.0|She loved the all the wimpy kids books she got for Christmas and had finished reading before her birthday in January.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was great made me laugh so much.I really would recommend this to anyone.you will end up r enjoying this movie
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed the book, thought it was a great story and loved the ending.  And it was free.  Always great getting a book free when it is good.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love to play this.  It takes my mind off from stressful things in my life. I play it all the time.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|i have not finished the book yet,but am finding it fascinating!  It is a fairly quick read, but requires a lot of digesting of the ideas presented.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's hard to say I love it when those miserable pigs keep smiling and blinking at me!  It's still fun.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The heading says it all!  It is one way to keep up on the lives of teenage grandkids that I do not get to see very often.
B0092D1V5Y|3.0|This app works well. It does what it is supposed to do. It was well worth the time to download it.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I love this movie. It's a &#34;classic&#34; and worth watching - although I could do without having Celine Dion stuck in my head for days after watching it...
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My two year old son especially loved &#34;Cahs!&#34;  The story is good and entertaining.  Now I have to deal with &#34;More Cahs!&#34;
B005LAII62|5.0|Are you kidding? This is the most fun I've had watching an animated film in a long time. The story is first rate and lesson-filled. But the steal the show characters stole my heart. I recognize many of the personality types yet, because of animation, they are much more extreme in looks and style. Some of the best scenes are with the supporting \\"actors and actresses.\\" But the little overweight boy and the ridiculous, bullet hole ear lobed, bully were hilarious. Lots of great laughs for everybody and a few scares too.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I was a big fan of the first season and this season just blew me away. They went out of the box and it worked!!!
B008JFUTT0|4.0|What is so amazing in this story is the fact that Sixto Rodriguez lyrics, so soulful and raw, are not something an American audience wanted to hear in the early 70's. Yet, many years later and through small, strange circumstances, he becomes famous, bigger than Elvis, in South Africa. Believed to be dead, (several horror stories have been making the rounds for years) he is discovered living and working hard labor, in Detroit. Although his fame waxes and wanes depending upon location, he never changes in personality. A true artist in that fame and fortune are not, and seemingly have never been the goal. Making his mark and a difference in the world, has been the reason for much of his music. He still lives in the same town, same house, does the same hard labor, sings, plays guitar and is the same man, his own man, that he always was, right from the beginning.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!I'm not much of a gamer but this game has definitely drawn me in. The graphics are good and I like how you can name your horse whatever you want.I sincerely recommend this for anyone who likes stimulating games or just horses in all.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|If you have &#34;tweens&#34; this should be a movie on their watch list.  It is fun for you and them!
B00009R86L|5.0|The Domke strap is really good all by itself but adding the Post Office Pad extends the comfort level to all day.  The padding gives it extra grip to minimze sliding off the shoulder and distributes the load across a larger area.  Excellent product.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a great game to pass the time ... I like that it doesn't require you to be online to play
B0048KXRR6|4.0|This movie, just like the previous Nanny McPhee movie, is about a traveling nanny that teaches children to behave and get along better. This nanny, though is not like any ordinary nanny, can use magic that causes both miracles and chaos for the children she cares for. Many crazy thing happen during the movie that causes problems, but work themselves out in the end. In the end, when the children want her, but no longer need her, she leaves, leaving only the memories of her for the children. This movie is fairly funny, yet sad at some scenes. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh and to be emotionally touched with the lessions of life.
B0002YLC24|1.0|I read some of the 4 and 5 star reviews, but the one star reviews were the most accurate. They are pretty spot on for this film. Snore! True, the dialogue is immature, and the characters are not likeable or impressive, or interesting. Some of the reviews here contain more interesting material than the film.<br />Wow, I couldn't stay with this one. Turned it off and chalked it up to chance, and moved it to the bottom shelf.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This movie, is an amazing story about a young, bright, 6 year old girl named Matilda, who is raised by a family who doesn't appriciate her. While growing up, her family has ignored her and never noticed her growing up. While she grows up, she goes to a school with a tyrannical, child hating school principal who loves to torment the childern in her school. Within that school, Matilda befriends the kindest teacher in school, Ms Honey. While attending this school, she learns that her mind is much more advanced than others and uses her talents to drive the principal out of the school. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves to laugh or to any Danny DeVito fans.
B00008973A|3.0|I am SUCH a fan of A CHORUS LINE (on the BROADWAY Stage - wooden boards - live audience!)<br />that I was disappointed with this rendition.<br /><br />I would LOVE to see SOMEONE set up a few cameras from the seats in the audience and SIMPLY record the live show from start to finish - JUST what we see from the Theater seats at the live performance.<br /><br />This film was a tremendous let-down.  HOWEVER - Bravo to the singers and dancers!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Only one wish is that you can flip the pages like regular books. In this app you have to look for that tiny arrow at the bottom. Still learning how to use my Kindle...
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|This is a number of &#34;cool&#34; looking set pieces and action scenes strung together with bad dialog and horrific acting.  I think Paul W.S. Anderson has become complacent and lazy.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|It was interesting to see how the writers tied this season to the first.  The question is how far back in time will they go to show how the lives of the characters are so intertwined.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Never expected the ending.  Would recommend to anyone who likes a good mystery.  Held my interest from the start.  A great read.
B0052FYPJK|5.0|This makes my 4th copy (the other 3 are hard copies). Not a book to be read in one sitting, I turn to the Tao as a resource of inspiration. Bruce Lee wasn't just a teacher, he was a lifelong student who utilized every means available to further his understanding of his own combat philosophy.
B00AYQNOU8|1.0|Apart from the beauty of the film, the download delivery hung up multiple times.Unfortunately, freezing on the chicken factory and cattle corrals; these are effective frames to prompt conversion to vegetarianism, but we gave up trying to watch after multiple attempts to jumpstart..
B009GX7IRA|1.0|Justified vs NCIS<br />NCis is a 10<br />Justified keeps getting worse and \\"worse ER \\"<br />It had become trite and simplistic ;<br />Raylan I once thought was on his way to be a new Clint Eastwood hero ; but his writers have sidelined him
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|No one could ever know what it would feel like to have a childhood like that unless they lived it themselves, but Ms. Hoover got me there. She was able to put me in that emotional quagmire and allow me to feel what those characters were feeling. Isn't that what great writing is all about? Isn't that what a great book is all about? I was there, with them, the whole time. Reading this book made me explore my own feelings about relationships in my life. Reading this book resulted in a wonderfully entertaining and emotional ride and some much needed soul searching. Thank you Ms. Hoover for a marvelous book. I look forward to your next!
B006O5YI7G|5.0|Good follow up on the original Billy the Kid and Sundance legend. Good photography, pretty authentic, enjoyed it a lot.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|I have yet to read  Michael Connelly Novel featuring LAPD Detective Harry Bosch that wasn't excellent. This is no exception. The pace is fast, the characters are good and the crime is hard to solve. The long suffering Bosch plows ahead through all obstacles to resolution of the crime. Great read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always loved horses and now I get to take care of Somerset . This app has brought so much joy to me. I love this game and there is no doubt about it. I think these horses are AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I found it rather boring. It must have been written for readers in their late teens. Foul language, school bullies, abuse and poorly written sex scenes. perhaps I'm too old to appreciate  the story line. Sorry to say the title sums up my opinion of this work.
1451627297|5.0|As soon as I knew this book existed, I had to have it. I always enjoy reading Stephen King's books, and this one had to do with a subject that was very attractive to me. It took me several days to read it in its entirety, but there was never a dull moment. I think this is his best work yet. Be prepared to get more out of it than just the direct dealing with Lee Harvey Oswald. It is well worth the time you take.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is amazing in his simplicity to help you find the real person you are.  He explains how all the harmful preconditioned thoughts from the past and all pessimistic future thoughts swirling in your head are only thoughts that have no real power over you and are not so important.  He also explains how to just allow these emotionally charged thoughts to pass over you, watch them leave and not have any emotional connection to them.  He simply explains how all we have is this moment we are now living in.  It is a very peaceful and liberating feeling.
B005LAII08|5.0|Adorable movie. My baby girl has watched numerous times since it's arrival. So pleased that I purchased this item for my children.
0061900656|5.0|I bought two different books on this subject, and this is perfect.  It doesn't show breast feeding at all, but it makes sense to a two-year old.  It really explains that the baby won't be able to play yet and also shows what the family will be like after the baby.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I guess I might be doing some thing wrong but did not work  like it does on my pc do not thing I will worry with any more..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if u liked temple run then you'll love this game. Temple run 2 has better graphics and parts. I think this game is way better than the first
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My family really enjoyed this story - fun, yet with a good message. Lots of laughs for everyone - all ages!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Short of the glitches in the daily challenges have had no issue it's fun challenging. The missions can be a little much but I guess they gotta make them challenging
B003MC5N28|4.0|My brother had to read it for school who I figured I would read it as well.  Good story line.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I did my research on this knife before I bought it so I was excited to get it, but even knowing what I was buying I was impressed with this knife! Came paper shaving sharp and was in perfect condition-no complaints-great knife!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What's not to love?  All of the Harry potter movies for a great price.  I love these shows and glad I bought them
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I have read many of James Herriot books, and love every one of them. I actually purchased this book for my brother, and he can't put it down. The stories are actual, factually correct, and give real humor to rather unpleasant occcurences that are actual situations.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Has a lot of kid and adult humor.  I will even watch it with my kids hitch is a good thing.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Great Music! Great Band! Great Performance.<br />Came to my college and performed at my homecoming...totally worth the free concert and I will definitely pay to go see them again!!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone it has all of the supernatural but is not like every other book out there.
B0091QS88K|5.0|Our little girl (3 years old) loves the Dr. Panda games... easy enough for her to play and keep her occupided while waiting at restaurants or the doctors office.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Kids loved this show in movie theatre so I bought it for them for Christmas.  They have watched over and over again.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I had the original set but the remastered is even better.  John Cleese is a genius.  Wish there were more episodes.
B004P7CN7W|5.0|Very suspenseful and it came in the mail fast and was packaged well.  This is a good movie for sure.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Why would anyone want to read a story like this. I read for enjoyment and this book was not enjoyable at all. The only reason  I finished it was because I paid good money for it and I was punishing myself for doing so.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I love this book, just reread it after several years. I recommend this book to anyone who likes historical novels
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I have to admit that at the beginning I was little bit bored, but as the book continued and the life in zoo was pictured in the most bright colors I slowly started to be taken by the slow pace of the story. The fantasy started to work and showed me the beatiful images of life.<br /><br />The way how the story is written leaves you a great space for your own imagination and you can choose your own version of truth. In fact the real value of the book is not in what is written but what is leaved up to you - the open questions you need to answer yourself, the allegories yet to be discovered and described...
B000GKW4HG|5.0|Our grandson loves dinosaurs. A perfect learning tool to spark his imagination. Very sturdy, he'll be able to share them with his children.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you like horses then you'll LOVE this game!!!!!! I totally would recommend this game! it is very interesting and fun!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great show, several unexpected plot twists and turns on a fairly standard sci-fi premise. Good character development and fairly good flow of the movie.
B00493E1GI|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to learn about  traveling to Italy the religion in India and Indonesia
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Not a lot I can say other than this was not the version I expected so I never used it.
0425264351|4.0|Book arrived in good shape and on time.  Can't ask for more than that.  It was an exciting introduction to the character.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great to have on my Kindle.  I love being able to check the weather at any time I want for anywhere I want.
0738711500|5.0|I love my new tarot cards, they are beautiful to the eye and in my hands. The book is truly easy to follow.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Enjoy Facebook as a way to keep up with friends and what is going on with them.  Have found friends that I have not seen in years.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|As many people have little knowledge of the Korean War, this book advances knowledge of the culture,,thinking, and peril of the times.  Truman, McArthur, Dulles, Eisenhower, and other luminaries and influential politicos of the times are presented in a factual and nonjudgmental manner, but the real heart of the book is the war from the POV of the &#34;citizen&#34; soldier.  The policy mistakes of the early war and the egotism of those in power is reminiscent of our contemporary government.  This disturbing account of America's &#34;forgotten&#34; war is well worth the read, and brings back the adage, of knowing history lest we repeat it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The saddest but the BEST book of Hunger Games. I recommend this book to ALL Hunger Games fans The BEST BOOK of the WHOLE series
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I love this book because it tells you everything you need to know about definitions and it is a th<br />greatest

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Don't listen to the bad reviews this app is really a good one.  I agree that there should be a password setting.  Overall I highly recommend this app
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|& I paid no attention to Tidal till last year. Its particularly thrilling to hear her voice in concert, she has the same wondrous pipes.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was great! I could not put it down, and it always kept me on my toes. I recommend everyone reads this book trilogy.
B0000073BG|4.0|Hard to describe, but rock with an orchestra.  Love Annie Haslams voice.  Had the album in the 70's, great to find it on CD again.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I am not among those who was put off by the dark tone of this novel -- although I admit, at times I wondered if there was anyone in this town worth liking.  By the end, though, as the pieces came together, I was swept into J.K. Rowling's masterful storytelling.  Every word of her writing has a purpose, and if you pay attention, the payoff is wonderful.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|This book was awesome. I would recommend recommending to all of my friends. I strongly suggest that you read this book!!! Hope  u all enjoy it as much as I did.<br />Bye y'all !!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just like everyone else, I found this novel one of the most compelling books I've read in several years.  The premise is unusual and the author carries it off without a hitch -- twists and turns throughout.  Loved it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'M LOVE horses but all the horses are expensive and it is really hard to get coins but it's fun
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Neil Gaiman is one of MY American Gods...a true artist.  This edition is very special - expanded to include additional material that Gaiman wanted to include in the original edition.  I got this on Kindle but may have to purchase the hardcover as a collector's item.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is an awesome game with a lot of adventure. One of the top 10 games! If you like adventure you'll like  Subway surfers.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love it!  Great story line and I love anything paranormal that has Southern dialect in it.  It just grabs you and sucks you into the story!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun I think y'all should make a subway surfer 2 soon<br /><br />I like subway surfers I like going on the tour or shall I say adventures fun ones I will tell everyone that this is the best game ever
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool fun addictive game must get good way to kill time. Subway surfer love it buy it it is free get it i dare you
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I is berry good and my brother likes it so get it it free bald hand finds dishes sidekick dormancy
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game...very addictive.  game play seems pretty realistic (I'm not a doctor but have above average medical knowledge).  I've played 150 times and still enjoy it.  You begin with a bacteria and by wiping out humanity you unlock new plague types.  If you beat everything on &quot;Brutal&quot; mode, you unlock the neurax worm and 3 cheat modes.  You can buy the worm and cheats but it's more satisfying to earn them...which I have.  My high score is just under 70,000 with a virus.  Just a very intriguing...yes, morbid game but it is amazing!  Looking forward to new plagues and new games from Endemic.  Bottom line, if you have any interest in biology and like games, this is a no brainer.  If you are even mildly interested in science, you'll love it.  If you could care less about anything science or health related, I bet you'll still like it!  Disclaimer...while many 5 star &quot;gushing&quot; reviews are bogus...I assure you that I had no knowledge of this game until I ran across it here to my Kindle.  I have read an interview with the developer since and am even more impressed.  This is his first game.  He used friends an family to help with graphics and sound but he's a true entrepreneur and Endemic is a very.<br />small company with this one game in their arsenal.  He wrote and published the game for Ios on his own but contracted with Miniclip to port the game to Android.  Apparently, it's harder to write games for Android...  This is why it's free for Jo's but a buck for Android...Miniclip has to get their share.  Still, this is worth 10 bucks for me.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book & see how Jack evolves.<br /> I had a hard time putting this book down.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|First of all, full disclosure: Kenny Loggins has been a friend for many years. That said, check my history, I have never reviewed any of his music before, in fact this is my first review of any kind.<br />  I love Blue Sky Riders \\"Finally Home\\".  Everyone I know who has heard it loves it. There will almost certainly be some who don't.  For example, you may be the type of person for whom the idea of three world-class songwriters inspiring and challenging each other to new heights is not compelling. Or let's just say you don't like the thought of melodies that walk around with you all day, whether you are listening to them or not.  Maybe you are not moved by harmonies so intricate, and so perfect they actually give you goose bumps. Or maybe you are uncomfortable with the ethos of this album, in fact the guiding principle of this band: the thought that it is never too late to make something spectacular happen in your life. Those people may not love \\"Finally Home\\".  To the other 95 percent of you I think this CD will be the most wonderful, unexpected musical gift you have had in a long time.<br /><br />To those who have taken the time to read this review, I can only say thank you. To those who read this review and decide to give Blue Sky Riders \\"Finally Home\\" a shot,  I can only say, you're welcome.
B0031R5K68|5.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books to date and this one did not disappoint,more twists and turns than a swiss watch you just have to keep on reading have had some very late nights/early mornings
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I had so much fun reading this book - trying to guess what twist and turn would happen next. I love most of Grisham's books and this is certainly one of his best. To say too much might ruin it, so just read it and enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I REALLY LOVE IT BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY GAME IT HAS TO DO WITH GETTING COINS AND STUFF!!!!!! My rating is *****!!!!!!!!
B007L4HFDI|3.0|It's just OKAY<br /><br />BUT... for me and my friends, the AMAZING Spider Man (with ANDREW GARFIELD instead of Tobey Maguire) is MUCH better and the version I had MEANT to buy ---- I screwed up and got this by mistake.  You may not agree, but I strongly suggest you watch both versions before buying this one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to download. A great app to add to my new Nexus tablet (received as a Christmas present). Actually reads more like a book than reading on the Kindle device itself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun!I play it every day even on weekdays when I have school!This game is one of my favorite games ever!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I purchased Season One for the Mrs. as a Christmas gift.  She just finished it and said it was very enjoyable.  She doesn't know, but I ordered Season 2 for her a few days ago - it'll be one of her Valentine's Day gifts.  ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game sooooooo addictive just can't put it down, the only thing that could make it better would be levels so you felt like it was getting more challenging, also if you could choose the landscapes but other than that I love it :-)
B00136Q2MA|4.0|A bit dated now, of course, but the combination of Babs' voice and Barry Gibb's late 70s Bee Gees ballad style was a sure win.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This app is an awesome one. It works so well if somebody wants a solitaire app this is the one to get.
0765325950|5.0|A fantastic ending to an epic series. These books have been my favorite for years and its bittersweet to finally finish them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The love and passion between the two main characters is just amazing. Great writing. I didn't want the story to end. You could have cut out all the sexual writing and iti still would have been a great love story. In fact, I found myself skimming past all the smut to get to the dialogue between the two main characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So far I am completely loving this game. Can't. wait to play a little big more to see what other surprises come up.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great graphics and an engaging storyline. More than worth the price I paid and should be a hit for anyone who enjoys the hidden object format. I will be looking for a sequel!<br />- dancinferret
1451695195|5.0|My daughter got this for Christmas and I really liked it as well. We both read the book and recommended it to my youngest daughter .

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Its more than just an alarm clock. Its so easy to set up and its free. I have been using this alarm for a while now and it never failed. if you are looking for a simple but yet classic alarm clock you have found what you have been looking for.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|It is a brand new DVD but it skips an hangs in middle. That not right. I have to forward certain scenes
B006ATJXQW|5.0|It was a very well written book and explained the whole series in the last chapter. I recommend this book to people who read The Maze Runner trilogy.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I play this game more than I should. it is very addicting. sometimes I wont even eat..... I even forget to breath
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham as always does a great job of character development. A thoroughly enjoyable read. Although I wanted a better ending.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|There's mystery, romance, imagination, and fantasy all perfectly balanced.<br />I loved the mix of characters and how their involvement in the circus developed.<br />The circus itself is a beautiful imaginative escape that I could read over and over. The mystery is not what happened or who did it - but how will the obvious problem be resolved and will there be - or wont there be - a happy ending.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|tThis item worked great.  this was for my daughter and she loves it. it fits the kindle fire like a glove.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I tried the Atkins plan years ago with great success. I wish I would have made it a lifestyle.<br /><br />I wanted current information and I wasn't disappointed. Dr. Westman provides the latest science. The basic idea is the same with one major difference: the emphasis on getting to ketosis is gone. The notion that it isn’t necessary makes the lifestyle easier to follow, which makes it easier to stick to. BTW, the new Atkins bars are delicious! I found it easier than ever to follow the diet knowing I had a sweet treat to get me through.<br /><br />How is it different from the Paleo craze? Atkins does not suggest you give up cheese. However, cottage cheese and yogurt are cautionary as they have carbs. Paleo diets tend to be low carb because all grain is decidedly bad for human health in general – and the science is convincing—but carrots and squash are included in Paleo (even though they have carbs) because they are a whole foods and not a grain.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Ok, so I really like Minecraft, but I can't update it. :'(  So that is why I rated it 4 stars.  Sorry... :'(
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Great series continues. Fun escape back into the past. Mid-century modern furniture is spot on.  Simpler time with plenty of man-made complications to keep it interesting.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|doesn't work on my grandkids tablets.  Takes forever to download and when it is downloaded will not play.  Very disappointing
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Avante-garde in its own time--and still is.  Sci-Fi on its own plane.  Young Harrison Ford and Darryl Hannah. Hauntingly touching.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Awesome show with all the Death Magnetic tunes and some great fan picks.  I can highly recommended this Blu-ray DVD!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app! My cousin was playing this game so I watch her for a bit and I was addicted. I had to get that app. This app is great!!! I really hope you like it if you get it. The seven dollars are worth it.:) I &lt;3 Minecraft
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|We've read all the Percy Jackson series and really enjoying this follow on series.  Rick Riordan is our favourite author.  We read everything he writes.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Play this app on my phone, but I have leveled up and did not want to start at the beginning!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|We really liked the story line of this book.  The author has a great series here.  I purchase books to read aloud to my children and found that very difficult because the book needs a lot of editing.  The spelling mistakes, words left out, misarrangement of paragraphs meant I had to stop in my reading to change things to make it make sense.<br /><br />I purchased the follow up book because my children really like the story and have found that to have very similar issues.<br /><br />Someone needs to take these books and edit them and then they will be brilliant.  Classics for generations to come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for all ages. Smooth controls and colorful graphics. Best thing is, it's free.<br />Give it a try and you'll soon be hooked.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is a wonderful book. It's very unique. It's a must read because it's a real book with real life problems. It's not a fairy tale, although it has a happy ending. The happy ending comes to the main character just as a happy ending would come in real life and I like that. It gives the book a tangible feel. The way the characters deal with their problems are much like real life situations. The book was a great book for me because like Pat I too have bipolar disorder.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|This has got to be one of the best books!  It really grabs your interest and engages your heart right away. Enjoy a good laugh out loud fun read that you can't put down and Don't want to end.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Written by AvidScribe<br />Originally posted on boookup dot blogspot dot com (former site run by Confessions From Romaholics) (NOT FULL REVIEW)<br /><br />That last line is no tease, it's true. I can't say when I have enjoyed a book more. I read voraciously and have consumed a huge diet of the classics, sci-fi, horror, thrillers and erotica. I'm a writer myself and know how important the right word is to lift a sentence and make it resonate and render it sublime. This writer has talent to spare and I would read a cereal box if she wrote the blurb for it.<br /><br />A friend recommended the book to me, saying she'd read it and thought I would enjoy it, given the list of books I've been referring her to for the past year or so. The two of us are devout readers and I've been suggesting authors and titles to her every month or so as I find things I like. This was tit for tat and, intrigued, I picked it up immediately to begin to read.<br /><br />As I read, in the back of my mind the story became an itch, reminding me of something that had been raved about by a group of friends online a year or so ago. Something about its storyline made me wonder if it was originally a TWILIGHT fanfic and I pursued this, asking if anyone recognized the story. It was indeed a TWI fanfic, originally called MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE and is a giant of a tale that I understand is being broken down into a trilogy for professional publication. Names are changed to protect the innocent sort of thing and there's some editing involved as well.<br /><br />It is a phenomenal work, a magnum opus, though I hope to see what this author might write next. Five stars isn't enough, this needs a whole new classification. Its fresh first person POV is a fusion of tender, erotic, tragic, harrowing, thrilling, suspenseful, hilarious and real. Above all, real. The writer's dialog is spot on. These are people you feel, that you could know, that you'd want to know. The heroine is a very young, unworldly police chief's daughter who is graduating from college when she meets Seattle's most eligible bachelor via an awkward and unprepared interview she does for her best friend who is too sick to do it herself. The fateful meeting has Grey fascinated with the shy beauty and he pursues her.<br /><br />Some writers are comfortable with description or their forte is great dialog. Some unravel an amazing story that compels you to miss meals, not answer phones, turn inward with a dark glee. Some can do great erotica. I rarely find a writer who can do ALL of it with such &eacute;lan as E L James has pulled off.'s daughter who is graduating from college when she meets Seattle's most eligible bachelor via an awkward and unprepared interview she does for her best friend who is too sick to do it herself.

B00136JQMI|5.0|This is one of the most highly recognized jazz albums ever. It's a refreshing conversation with life, emotion, and--most obvious--music. Davis' sophisticated style caresses the background piano without completely overshadowing it. At the same time, he cascades across the scale, illuminating the minor chords and spontaneous drum rhythms. This is a great work--a must have!
B000BNX3B4|4.0|It's an easy, re-watchable movie that my wife and I can enjoy together.  She won't sit down and watch the Bourne movies or Lord of the Rings for that matter.  That's okay I like those too but this one allows us relaxed time together.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|Amazon music is inexpensive, fast and easy. It is the only music I buy other than an occasional classic from their other shopper areas.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I had always wanted to see this movie and when I found it for the price I did I could not pass it up.  It is truly one of the great character pieces I have ever seen.  I would recommend this to anyone, even if you don't like romance movies this one is still worth a watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game!!! It's really fun and I wish there was more subway surfer games!  I just wish things aren't so expensive,like for the rio game Carmen is 97000 and we have to make that much money in 24 hours!? Like wtf, but other than that its awesome!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cute!  I've always wanted a horse! Now i can have one without at the expenses. Hasn't crashed. Easy walk through all in all good clean fun.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Surprisingly good for 99 cents. This would make a good movie. Could not put it down once I started.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|very neat game! very real looking and a great time killer xD one of those games you'll find yourself coming back to
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was so sure that I could not be fooled by a book but this one got me, reached right up and bit me. Mrs. Flynn is a fantastic writer. And the ending, though some won't like it, is really the only way it could end after the big reveal at the midway point. Great read!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Most of the games are fun for passing time. Don't like the soccer game. Haven't needed to spend any money either! Coins are easy enough to win.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved this movie! It's not often that a contemporary movie deals so honestly with subjects such as death and loss, while at the same time showing the passion and love-of-life which older adults experience. The acting is superb - Dame Judy Dench and Dame Maggie Smith are wonderful as always. Definitely watch this!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I WILL WAtch any Denzel Washington movie. He is a fabulous actor and he gets better with every movie he is in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I had never heard of the game before. But I am so glad I downloaded it because I can't seem to put it down . The only problem I have with this game are the updates. I don't know why but for some reason Im not getting them, my phone's version has had 3 updates already but my kindle hasn't had a update since probably January or February and I don't know how to fix that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband is addicted to this show.  I have to admit that I love watching too, it is not simply a movie about zombies, but of survival and the hard choices we have to make when faced with death and uncertainty.  I think that it is a great series that transcends the fictional and hopefully resonates with everyone about how quickly our lives can be turned upside.  Survival and preparedness are key in these circumstances and I think the show depicts the human struggles very well.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|I started watching 'Arrow' with low expectations, but soon discovered the producers and actors are working at giving a quality product to their audience.<br /><br />My wife and I have continued to watch, enjoying the triple story lines for Oliver (scion's son / survivor of a terrible shipwreck / vigilante), and are interested enough to see where the creative team takes the character.<br /><br />Give it a shot - so far, so good!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This may be the best value I have found on amazon.com.  So inexpensive but durable and attractive. I have had it for six months now and still looks great.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This product works as stated & I would Buy again.<br /><br />UPDATE:  As I was corrected by Barbara King, one side is flat & other side is pressed in similar to a giant thumb indent (Top), and it's the \\"Top\\" that will attach screen side of the tablet and you will feel a strong \\"pull\\" and a \\"click\\" sound...needs very little adjusting to get the connection.  Although mine also connects (holds in place) when I flip it around on the opposite side, but not as securely & No \\"Click\\" sound, so I will continue to use as stated above, since it was made to fit flush by following the curves of the tablet edge.<br /><br />I've seen auctions on eBay WAY-WAY higher (ending in triple digits) than the price offered here & glad I picked up 2 while available.<br /><br />With the cases I'm using as well as a TPU, it does not always connect easily (with no fault of the Pogo Cable), as the cases cut-aways were not cut large enough to accommodate the Pogo, but after working with it, eventually does connect.<br /><br />Someone else stated their power (wall) adapter heats up more when charging with the Pogo, but mine heats equally as much w/ this Pogo vs. the orig. micro USB.<br /><br />Was tired of waiting for OEM products for the N10, so very happy this is a Quality made product @ an Excellent Price & suggest this product highly !
0783240236|4.0|Probably one of Tipie's best movie, although i haven't seen much of her. She was good in this an american horror classic. Original back then in every way.
159514188X|2.0|I love YA books and this was a good story but I kept wondering why the main character (or the girl telling the story) never sought therapeutic help.  She has time to record a very detailed story on why but never sought help?  She then ends the book/story going to a teacher to give him the chance to help her but since she never ASKS for help she doesn't get any and then kills herself.  Had- at any point- she asked for help, things would have been different.  And the books ends with the main character helping another student who is showing depression signs which is fine but you don't get the idea that he will ever push her to a licensed therapist.  Which is dumb.  This book basically says youth should help other youth to solve deep psychological problems.  Which is horribly wrong.  If you can find a TAPE DECK in this decade you can find someone more qualified to deal with depression than a teenage male.

1591844096|4.0|\\"Embrace your lizard brain. It's the source of understanding why you're in a job that sucks.\\"<br /><br />Seth Godin's book, Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?<br />came out Jan. 26, 2010. In the meantime, some members of Triiibes.com (his social media site) and those who responded to an offer to donate $30 to the Acumen Fund, received advance copies. I was fortunate enough to get my hands on a copy, so here's my review. First, it's a definite thumbs UP on the book. Buy it. If you need more convincing, read the review below.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book summary, or the Cliff's Notes version of Linchpin, this isn't it. As a member of Triiibes.com, and someone who has read all of Seth's books and met the man, my impressions are not going to be totally unbiased. I haven't drunk the Kool-aid, but I do highly respect and admire the man. If it weren't for his encouragement and help I'd never have made it to TED, or grown as much as I have in the past year.<br /><br />First off, I think Linchpin is different in many ways than anything Seth has written. I think his writing shift started with Tribes. He gave readers a glimpse into more of who Seth is, what he thinks, how he feels. He's put more of himself into Linchpin than he did in Tribes, but not until the second half of Linchpin. His sentence structure is longer, and more complex. His \\"voice\\" is different - more studied, more analytical, more like he walked away from several discussions/debates and contemplation and the input of friends rather than simply a recounting or teaching of things he knew personally (ie. The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick).<br /><br />My impression (and that's all it is), is that Seth has spent more time listening, reading about, and hammering away at the ideas he's presenting here than he has with his other books. Linchpin feels more intellectually collaborative, more like some of the themes and direction were thrashed through with the help of significant others and authors - more than simply Seth's delving into a topic he has extensive first-hand knowledge of.<br /><br />The talk of resistance rang a bell for me simply because I read Steven Pressman's essay/blog on the topic before I even knew Linchpin was being written. And from the excerpts I've read in The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles, overcoming resistance is a huge part of becoming a linchpin. (By the way, if you haven't read Pressman's blog, it's usually brilliant and fascinating and worth subscribing to. And - for trivia buffs, Pressman was once homeless - living in his Chevy van with his cat before conquering resistance to being a writer instead of a truck driver or one of others of the dozens of jobs he held before recognizing resistance: [...])<br /><br />LINCHPIN REVIEW<br /><br />Linchpin is 244 pages long. The good stuff, the stuff that made me take my feet off my desk and lean forward to grab my highlighter, starts on page 101. Seth, as you know if you pay attention to his writing style, always begins with a foundation, the history of ______, the background, the prologue, the reason for the important stuff to follow and Linchpin is no different. The first half of the book makes for great debate and presentation fodder and will bring you up to speed on the state of the corporate culture as we know it - if you haven't been paying attention.<br /><br />If you already know that corporate America is still stranded, for the most part, in the 80's - then you won't be surprised by the first half of the book. If you are a member of Triiibes.com, you will definitely not be surprised by anything in the first 100 pages. If you are still wondering what's wrong about asking your secretary to fix your coffee or pick up your dry cleaning; or if you have the numbers of third world sweatshops on speed dial you really do need to read those first 100 pages.<br /><br />No need for a spoiler alert here - most of you know theusual insights and basics if you're a Seth fan. The first 100 pages cover those basics, such as the title headings indicate: Introduction, The New World of Work, Thinking About Your Choice, Indoctrination-How We Got Here, Becoming the Linchpin and Is It Possible to do Hard Work in a Cubicle?<br /><br />What I found interesting about Linchpin was that Seth is reaching out to the individual more in this book than any other - save Tribes. I wonder if he's become frustrated with trying to explain a \\"better way of being\\" to corporate executives and decided to build up the perfect workplace from the bottom up - which is where it should come from - the people who work in the rank and file. If you're an artist, or a \\"creative\\" then you can find some comfort in what Seth is saying. Like Dan Pink and his recent book: A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future Seth encourages the right brained worker to step forward and become \\"indispensable.\\"<br /><br />If you are a clueless, reluctant, skeptical cog in search of economic salvation, you'll need those first 100 pages to convince you that the world really IS changing. You'll need to realize that not everyone worships or accepts the concept of a vertical food chain terminating in the corner office for those not handicapped by a glass ceiling. You'll find the reasoning you need in the first 100 pages.<br /><br />However, if you already know the state of the average workplace, and consider it a dusty, boring place filled with cubical monkeys and supervisors who remind you of the soup nazi's of work, as in: \\"No questions or NO JOB FOR YOU!,\\" then skip ahead to page 101. Save the first half of the book for later, for incorporating into your conversations with people who ask, \\"Who is Seth Godin?\\"<br /><br />Seriously. If you need reasons, historical recaps and someone to bring you up to speed on the fact that the average workplace kills creativity; if you need the definition of purple cows and remarkable; or if you don't know in your heart of hearts that being different, generous, remarkable and better worker is a good thing, then start at page one and read on.<br /><br />From page 1 to 100 you'll get great info, solid background and a typical Seth observation of the history of the workplace. You'll find the evolution of the world of minimum wage, how outsourcing and the dumbing down of the American worker has starved our souls and created a disposable employee mindset and economy.<br /><br />Read it. But if you want to dive into more than a retrospective of why most workers and those who pay them are mind numbingly clueless then skip ahead. If you know you are destined for a future without a gold watch or retirement that will actually cover the expenses of your golden years, then start reading on page 101. Return to the beginning later. If you've never read a Seth Godin book, or seen or heard one of his talks, then by all means, start with page one - this is good stuff. But page 101 on is better.<br /><br />What surprised me most about all the talk of linchpins is that I don't think the word \\"unicorn\\" is used once in the entire book. Seth, well known for his championing of the Unicorn, the remarkable worker who shows up in balloon factories (popping the bubbles of status quo beliefs) doesn't mention the creature in this book. I don't know if that's because unicorns aren't usually linchpins, or if Seth has figured out that talk of creatures that scare, upset or threaten the status quo doesn't play as well to corporate moguls as the idea of a linchpin - an invaluable, creative team player who responds well to rewards, plays well with others and doesn't run with scissors.<br /><br />Same creature, different story. Or is it? Can a linchpin be a unicorn? Or can a unicorn be a linchpin? It's not answered in this book, but it's an intriguing question isn't it?<br /><br />There's no doubt about it, Seth is focused on the individual in this book - not on changing corporate America. In Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us<br />Seth urges readers to lead. In Linchpin he urges them to become the artist, the creative, indispensable person they can be. All you need to do is eliminate the fear (which, Seth explains, is really anxiety. People, he notes, confuse the two all the time.<br /><br />Anyway, beginning with \\"Resistance,\\" on page 101, Seth takes a really good, basic look at lizard brains, that \\"fearful, hungry, angry and horny\\" part of our brains that controls so much of our thinking and a great deal of our actions. The lizard brain causes us to confuse fear and anxiety, to seek safety rather than risk brilliance. It also works and walks hand-in-hand with resistance - to totally stop us in our tracks.<br /><br />I hear the influence of Pressman's The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles<br />in the second half of the book. I also see a good effort to reduce a lot of information into a handful of chapters. As a writer I can empathize and appreciate his creation of a roux of wisdom that packs a greater taste than three times the words. The tone in the second half of Linchpin is more like Seth's previous books -- more like Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us<br />- still my favorite. He retains the blog post length of chapters - one of the great things about his writing style.<br /><br />I found it amusing that Seth mentioned his favorite negative review (A review on Amazon.com) of his book Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us<br />- since I responded to that particular reviewer (on Amazon) when the book came out. Since it's all but impossible (never say never) to list specific steps in \\"how-to\\" be a creative genius, or a leader, or a remarkable person or business; his negative reviewer won't much like Linchpin either; even though he comes closer to taking the reader's hand and walking them through the process as much as is humanly possible.<br /><br />As always Seth incorporates vignettes of linchpins he knows personally, using the short, short story of a success to make a point. He has developed the 200 to 300 word inspirational, informative or insightful parable to an art form.<br /><br />If I had one criticism of the book, it would be that the second half of the book wasn't longer and the first half wasn't shorter. Like any creative person, understanding HOW to succeed, to act, to learn the rules of the workplace while becoming a linchpin is confusing. Seth urges workers to give more, to be more of who they are and to not just coast through their jobs putting in their time. Generosity and engagement is its own reward, he says.<br /><br />As a creative person who has given and given and given and been fired, and fired and fired for being remarkable, different, creative and generous - I have to say I wish there were more specific instructions on exactly how to escape a job where generosity is taken advantage of by cruel and stupid employers; and how to find a job where such skills are valued and rewarded.<br /><br />There may be a few hundred employers who look for and hire generous and creative people, but there is no \\"how-to\\" chapter on how to find them if they aren't mentioned in the book.<br /><br />What I liked best about Linchpin was the bibliography. Not only was it personal and helpful, but it was appreciative and thoughtful. If you haven't read any of Seth's books, I suggest starting with this one, then reading Tribes. Between the two you'll have a good idea of where the new workplace is going and how to be a part of it.g, then start at page one and read on.

B007MD2RHC|5.0|For the unaware, Thomas Bergerson is a composer who formed a partnership with fellow composer Nick Phoenix to start the company Two Steps from Hell specifically to produce music for music and video game trailers.  Their resume is too long to list.  Lets just say if you've seen any movie trailers for big budget movies in the past five years you have probably been exposed to some of their work.<br /><br />This disk isn't Two Steps from Hell.  It's just Thomas and his music.  The inside cover of Illusions carries a message from Thomas.  He said that over the past three years whenever he felt he had written something especially special he saved it for this disk.<br /><br />He was right.  This disk is filled with nothing but truly extraordinary music.  It is easily better than Skyworld, Archangel, or Invincible.  Please don't mistake that last statement as criticism of those three albums.  To compare by analogy, if those three were beer they would be Rochefort 6, 8 and 10 respectively.  Illusions is Westveletran 12.  If you're not a beer nut that's like comparing Colt Pythons from the 1970s, 1960s, and 1950s to a Korth.  If you're not a gun nut then I'm running out of suitable comparisons.  Lets just leave it at the work he and Nick did with Two Steps from Hell is phenomenal and Illusions is much, much better.<br /><br />If you are still unsure about buying this disk, step on over to Youtube and do a search.  I am sure you will be impressed.

I started at 212 and was running 2 to3 times a week for 30 min, about 3 miles per time.  With the program we did it 6days a week.  Im going to run three and do Jillian 3 days per week to try and lose 10 pounds
B001RIY4WE|1.0|The reason for this rating is that I purchased it and it was the wrong region - my fault but, no more purchases.<br /><br />I have watched the movie on another DVD and really enjoyed it.

B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This movie seemed to rely to much on its predecessors. The story was choppy, and cur poorly. The ending was predictably open ended.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I don't like horror movies, I really don't. I started watching American Horror Story out of curiosity when it came on Netflix and was hooked almost immediately. It's so smart, thrilling, touching, exciting and deeply addictive. The second season is only better than the first, and those who grew attached to the characters in season 1 should definitely not be afraid to go ahead and check out the second season in a new location with new, incredible, plot twists and turns. A great show, a smart show, and a true pleasure without any guilt at all.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book grabs you so hard and won't let go.  After reading the first one, had to find the follow up books very fast.  What a mind this man had
B005NQ94KS|4.0|One Day starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess is a beautiful love story. I have also read the book prior to seeing the movie, the guy who wrote the book also wrote the screenplay, it's a faithful adaptation...stays true to the deep and chaotic friendship/relationship between Dex and Emma. I thought Hathaway was an excellent choice to play Emma, she really brings out Emma's sarcastic, slightly insecure nature while Sturgess brings out Dex's womanizing and yet kind-hearted playful banter. Dex is not very likable in the beginning but you really feel towards the middle of the film, he's a good guy...he's just a little misguided. Parts of the film felt rushed to me, whereas the book gives a lot more space and we get to see Dex and Emma's deep love for each other. Beautiful film if you enjoy romantic dramas (like I do), give it a try!
B000FC1GJW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  What a concept.  I have read the first book to my granddaughter.  After reading it, we got the movie and she is in love with it as much as I was.  I wish there was a movie on this book as well

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great, well-told story.  Brings the reader into the thoughts and actions of a desperate time.  Gives a new respect for what the men and women went through.
B003AYMZO2|4.0|Started watching  this series when I saw the lead actor win on the SAG award show. This season seems to have a bit too much &#34;filler&#34; but that's understandable considering the time they must spend doing the amazing action and location scenes. The budget for the show must be astronomical. Basically, we love the show and have missed a lot of sleep by staying up late watching three or four episodes, just trying to catch up to this season. The writing and weird happenings suit our sense of the absurd and we enjoy it tremendously!!!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie has so much amazing singing and dancing, it brings back memories of my show choir days. It reminds me a lot of Grease, it has a story line and in the end the boy and girl end up together.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The best part is it is free of charge. You can play for hours and not get bored as each hand is different from the last.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I LOVE this game! It's very addictive and fun. You never know what you might get when breeding the dragons. The people who also play this game are very nice, TOO!
B006HL9G10|4.0|Very nice app..great for meditation...just a little difficult to create presets..it makes a wonderful timer for sleep. Love the choice of bowls.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Made the search for ancient books into an interesting mystery.  Lengthy tome but an enjoyable, educational read.  Amazed to learn (or relearn!), how much the ancient Greeks actually knew.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun to play. I got hooked within the first 5 minutes of downloading. It was pretty hard at first but I caught on quickly and now have the highest score out of all my friends.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|Not exactly what I expected it to be, but Michael Shannon, Jessica Chastain, and Shea Whigham were fabulous.  The special effects are pretty good, too.
B00772M1F6|5.0|JD McPherson album is off the chart great!  I can listen to it over and over and over.  He is real rock n roll!  After watching a few youtube performances, I had to have the CD!  Words fail me!  Can hardly wait for the next album which will be added to my collection.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is one of the best repeaating series in recent years in my opinion.  I'm glad I watched it from the beginning, and now to be able to go back and rewatch it from the beginning again, oh boy.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Haven't watched the entire first season, however, I just got it and have watched 4 episodes!  It is excellent.  I had heard that it was excellent and wanted to see for myself. Thank you, Amazon, for providing the opportunity!!!
B007L6VR12|2.0|Good actors playing silly characters, thought they should have known better.  Maybe this is just one of the esoteric movies, and I just didn't get it.  What was the plot?  What was the moral?  I didn't get it.
1419707663|5.0|Great price for what you get! Hard cover books in an nice hard cardboard box. Fantastic purchase. I would recommend this product to anyone.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I got the book, then the movie.  They were both good.  I don't know if this rating is for the book or the movie, I got them both thru Amazon.  Covers are the same.  The movie was good, but the characters were changed around from the book.  The book was really a good story, more feeling than the movie, you got the emotions of both generations of families, mothers/fathers vs. sons/daughters in the book.  The movies had very little to do with the children which was a shame, it was why they were there in the first place.  Anyway would recommend either/both.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Shock drama at it's best. Season three is turning out to be the best in the series to date. The zombies are the least of our groups problems. The drama is intense, the pace is quick, and every episode a cliff hanger that leavesleaves you thinking either, \\"Oh, they better not...\\" or \\"Please, don't let 'em get...\\"<br />Love'n this show!
B005AKFXZW|5.0|This is not my normal genre to read and I hadn't heard of this book at all but a few friends gave it their thumbs up and the just the opening of the book gripped me.  I rarely give 5 stars but the story is unique to me, utterly spellbinding.  Comparing it to Harry Potter (as many reviewers have done) is an insult and it would have put me off reading it had I seen it before starting.  There is magic, therein the comparison ends.<br /><br />The circus arrives without warning, it appears in a field over night.  It's not like any other circus you've seen.  Not a splash of colour anywhere and only open from dusk till dawn.  Spread though the book are descriptive chapters of different parts/performers in the tents, like \\"Cirque du Soleil\\" with magic - it is so beautifully written.<br /><br />For the rest of the story we follow Celia, Marco and later Bailey but the story jumps back and forth in the years.  Ceila and Marco are pitted against each other and bound to each other at the same time in a challenge they don't understand the rules of and they begin to realise there is no time limit on it. They have been trained in using magic but quite differently and their trainers are indifferent to them - and only interested in being in the winning camp.  Slowly Marco and Celia begin to be drawn to each other.<br /><br />I loved the ending.  Not only was it a very clever for Celia and Marco but I loved that it didn't leave all the other characters out of it.<br /><br />I wish this circus would come to my town.<br /><br />I will definitely read more from this author.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it is written so well and has twist and turns at every page. I loved how each word in the book was  meaningful and powerful and most of all I loved the reason why this book is called hopeless.it does the book justice. I highly recommend this book but it deals with adult situations but it's presented well.
0062086529|4.0|Would have liked a bit of common sense from Amazon in their gift wrap department!  So ugly, I wrapped over the plain blue paper, more suitable for an adult male than a 4 year old boy for his birthday, which was evident from the product and the card. I won't be paying for any more gift wrapping from Amazon. It's too expensive, anyway, for what it is.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.<br />I was constantly reaching for  a tissue.<br />Great book for young adults and older.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good food! I like it because it's fun and my neighbor adores it. I love eve the new update it is cool to have it in NYC and Rio.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't wait for season three after watching seasons one and two.  What a great show. Now I have to wait for season 4.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|All is good. The only thing I don't like is some of the missions are confusing. Other then that it's a really fun and good game.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|So beautiful on blue-ray. So happy I purchased this dvd. Works great and love watching it! A must or your library
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app gets me so frustrated at times. Mostly because if I click on a  picture, it won't back out onto the newsfeed unless I continue to click on the back button a dozen or so times. Annoying!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Looking forward to read the next book of the series.  Very hard to put down. Reads easily and entertaining. A plus novel.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is fun, very addictive. There is a flaw however,  it lags while running, causing a crash and the game crashes when using gems to continue, so it deducted them from your total,  then crashes and loses the score and coins.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy this more than its predecessor.  Graphics are great.  I have it for Kindle fire and GS3.  Much like the previous version, it is more laggy on Android than on iPhone or iPad.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|Whenever I feel stressed I just play this CD and I am transform to a different place.Very soothing sounds mixed with beautiful words. Breezy does it again. I appreciate his talent very much.
B0063IH60K|3.0|What can I say?  It's solitaire.  It's a good way to pass the time, but maybe I have played out the thrill.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Awesome. Just awesome. Only thing that was weird and not really explained was the sub-story about Kit. Other than that leaving unanswered questions, it was so nice and dark the way one would expect a horror story to be. The first season had humor in it, which was fine, but it wouldn't have conveyed well in this season. At least, I don't recall really any humor, so if there was some, it was few and far between.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This is another app. that I have only used for entertainment, but it has several choices included that I like.  I believe it could be a good start teacher for someone wanting to play piano, but not having the equipment or facilities.  This requires a lot less space and money than a concert grand.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Never knew these stories still existed. So good and refreshing. Loved the story and how it evolves and what a sweet ending.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|I enjoy this app., however, I have only used it for entertainment and have not tried to play the songs or see what kind of challenge they would present.
B004VBAHG6|5.0|i would recommend this cd to any one who wants to understand the lyrics and what they mean..  Peter Murphy  rocks, have followed and listened for over 20 yrs now....
0553801473|3.0|Wonderful writing.  Too bad there's so much of it.<br /><br />Let's be honest - this book DID NOT have to be as long as it is.  There were numerous chapters that could have been eliminated without impacting the flow of the story.<br /><br />Quentin Martell did not need his own POV.  Did Barristan Selmy get his own POV when he travelled to join up with Dany in book two?  No, because it wasn't necessary.  And it actually had more impact when Selmy announced his real identity in book three, rather than having the readers follow every step of his journey from Kings Landing.  There's nothing I can think of from Quentin's chapters that couldn't have been thrown into other parts of the book through third party conversations or his own interactions with Danaerys.  I'm sure somebody will correct me if I'm wrong.<br /><br />And eliminating the overindulgent descriptions of food and the pale mare / bloody flux / bowel movements would have probably cut the book down by almost a third.<br /><br />Writers love their own writing, and that's why there are editors to cut out the unnecessary sonnets that don't provide any value to the overall story.  I don't know what happened to the editor for this book - or if there even was one - but that person totally slipped on the job.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun its a must have. If your looking for somewhat of a challenge. Its fun for adults & children I encourage purchasing this game on kindle, ipad, iphone, or android devices.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|At first it was hard to play and now I cannot stop lol! My daughter asked for it and it is very entertaining. Good App.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is a good way to help people when they need help see with words .so that what I think
B004HO6HWA|5.0|This movie prove to be a great movie from the start. I enjoyed watching most of Jason Statham movies due to his talent as a actor. This movie worth the cost of owning by far, with a great ending!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game that challenges you constantly. Highly recommended if you like to be new obstacles. I do enjoy the different missions which is what makes it fun to accomplish different goals.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I read &#34;Second Son&#34; first, and that hooked me on the series. Looking forward to reading more &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; novels.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't put them down!!!!<br />Ready to start book three and hoping will my questions are answered!!  LET IT BEGIN  NOW!
B009ZQRS2I|5.0|This was a fun film.  They characters were interesting, the plot was pleasantly vague, and the ending superb.  This is a great alternative to the boring films being released by Hollywood.  If you don't like this movie, you are the problem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should get subway surfers because it is fun and if you like temple run you will like this!! You can jump on trains and collect coins. I think it's a great game for when your bored or on the go!!!!!!!!!!!![[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie was enjoyable for the first 15 minutes then it tapered down to a stereotypical comedy with very little that was entertaining.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game anyone could play some people I know name them like heroibrin and stuff like that so buy it before the next update
0634022296|5.0|I like this book so much, I might buy it again - keep one at home and put it in my music studio.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this show. From the music, scenery, costumes to the actors, this is what makes up a great show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is really fun but the only thing is I wish you could change what type of horse you get in the start. :) over all this is an awesome app, glad I bought it. And its free, too!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Beauty is a gorgeous horse that is yours to take care of. She needs tender care and quickly becomes a friend.
B001NHNG64|2.0|The storyline in general was a good idea, however, the characters we're shallowly written and did not reflect the intelligence you would expect for the career's being portrayed. Even though it is quite obvious the main character is basically  a drifter, I did not like him just being dumped out in the end like he had no bearing on events that had just taken place.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|A lot of unknown events happened that kind of surprised me. I find Mr. Martin has a devious mind and can blend a story and plot as well as the best writers' of today. I hope book four, which I will start shortly, is as good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|BEST GAME. EVER  this game is better than any game I have ever played so please play this game it will change your life
B000BNI90O|5.0|This purchase completes my set of all three Complete Recordings from the LOTR trilogy. Each is great although somewhat hard to find now. If you love these soundtracks, I would definitely recommend obtaining a copy. It's worth the search.
0811879542|5.0|I gave this as a gift for my nephew and my sister has told me he loved it. He is all smiles as they go through the pages together and am glad I bought this for  him.
B009HSPODE|1.0|boring stories from small town canada - could only get half way through before it just got too hard. Dont bother.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is so fun the horses are so pretty! you even get to name them! I was so surprised when I saw it was free!
1451695195|5.0|Many people question the very existance of heaven. This book helps me explain to these doubters that it is real and they have no reason to fear death.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game a great time killer. Its so easy to play even my four year old son can enjoy the fun.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Getting one, two, and three stars on each level gets you the bonus Crown &#34;achievement&#34;, which gives the kids good variety in trying to accomplish this and not just getting three stars. Fun graphics and sounds.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|This album seemed to dust  aside some of her earlie catchy hooks and more simple pop sound.  This is a more sufisicated sound that shows more of her talents.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was  so amazing. So many twists  and turns and u never  knew what was  going to happen next.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I wasn't familure with this artist when I purcahse the album. The album realy grew on me. I especaily enjoy the sound and style of her voice.  I since uploaded a concert she did  &#34;Live at the Trubadore&#34;. She was awsome.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook seems to have fixed issues with this app only for others to show up. The sort function for the newsfeed rarely works and the back button when viewing photos has to be hit multiple times. For a company with so many users you would think that they would put more effort in designing apps and responding to issues.
B009VB998I|5.0|This is a very sweet (and well told) story of two sister fairies finding each other, being kept apart, and devising ways to spend time together.  Very recently my 5-year-old daughter has become interested in fairies and Tinkerbell in particular.  She is still not ready for a lot of other cartoon movies because they usually have villains, which she finds too scary.  This movie has no villains -- the fairy sister are kept apart &#34;for their own safety.&#34;  It is also surprisingly enjoyable movie and it has a lot of charming scenes your kids will enjoy.  For example, when the animals cross over to the winter area, their coats all turn white (to prepare them for winter).  And a major bonus -- it kept me entertained -- I never found myself wandering away doing other chores while the movie was on.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this new temple run it has many more things to move around, jump over, and my new favorite part is when you get to a certian point you go in to a rail road and you tilt and duck to get through their. but yet there is 1 thing I do not like is that when you get that really fast thing and the animal is on your tail the animal gets faster to and they are still right behind you.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Liked the book a lot and made you feel good.  Got a little too technical at times but all in all great.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent book! It had me laughing and crying. The book was sad but set a tone of hope. It reminded me of what love is all about.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is fast paced and you can earn money quickly to upgrade and purchase items to serve customers faster.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Another fast read for me can't wait for the next one to come out and see what happens to E & G
1881273873|4.0|This book was not revelational, but it definitely prompted me to look at my relationships and see what I can do to love people better :).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It very fun , it has new things that u wouldn't think of. And you should get it for the fun of the game
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle always exceeds my expectations.  What a marvelous voice. I do wish she would release her albums more frequently.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I just loved this book! It gave me a lot of laughs but also many thoughts!<br />Really a life guide book as it seems to me!<br />Extremely well written!<br />Highly recommend!
0307463745|4.0|I found myself spending more time writing notes and thinking on the content than I did actually reading. It's a short read but well worth it. Though I do agree with the other reviewers, much of the content was said in Getting Real or in blogposts. Still I regularly recommend this book to others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a terrific story, with likable and believable characters, and an intriguing plot.  This is the kind of book I love to recommend to others.  Get it and enjoy!
B00AUA67GQ|1.0|I didn't keep this app because had too many whistles and bells.  I was looking for a simple journal keeping app
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is my first season on the TV, but I download the episodes to my Kindle Fire anyway. That is how I caught up after realizing after second season I was missing an epic! I watch each episode several times. Am SO ADDICTED.<br /><br />FREE BATES!!!
B004QX07G4|4.0|After reading Tina Fey' s Bossypants, I was itching for another book penned by a comedienne. DeGeneres proved to be just the ticket. I was entertained and very thankful for this lighthearted read.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|my sister had it on her kindle and wouldn't stop braving about it so I disided to get the game and I couldn't stop playing it I love it. :)
B0060AY85C|4.0|I love Toni Morrison and I read all of her books. This one was very good: the characters were well drawn, the settings were very realistic. But I would have loved it if the book had been longer with more narration about how the characters were changing. One character in particular went from being mentally ill and addicted to being almost normal and I don't know how this happened.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the best of all the Temple Runs even the ones that haven't been created yet! This round there are hang gliders and minetshafts!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|amusing time warp concept; portrayal of literary/art figures very good; allusions to literary/art works very good. American fiancee - shades of Isabel in 'The Razor's Edge'?
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this game and the graphics! I learned about this game from friend and this is Incredibly awesome! This game is a must buy for war game lovers. Also if you like a challenge you can play the apocalypse levels rand deflation levels.
B005LAIGTG|5.0|Loved this real life book. They stayed very true to the book, one should read the book first before seeing the movie to gain a full understanding.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept me guessing.  I couldn't put it down once I finished the first few chapters.  I was surprised by the turns that were taken in the book.  I would recommend to others.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I got exactly what I expected with no problems!  This is now one of my favorite books to read and I am very glad that I purchased it!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars is a favorite of mine; love the compilations with other artists. He can hit the highs & lows, and has unique range of styles, such as contemporary pop, reggae, upbeat. These tunes play in my head over & over, a good thing!
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|The product itself was great.  I received the book very quickly, but I just was not really impressed with the overall book.  I have several friends that loved it, but I just could not get over all of the &#34;fluffy&#34; wording and tons of imagery.  Overall a decent book, but not for my liking.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Funny, light, for the young & old alike! Most people have or have experienced the types of characters in this family, which makes it relateable. Has become a Christmas movie tradition!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Kid's review:<br />I love this app I played it on my sisters tablet and it is amazing. And free!! A must have. Way better than Temple Run :)
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I absolutely Love Bruno's voice & range of talent! His melodies & songs vary greatly, which is an example of his abilities. Language is not for the squeamish.
859037985X|5.0|I own all the 3 paper editions of Roberto's PIL, and I was never disappointed by any of them, Nevertheless, IMHO the quality of the 2nd and of the new 3rd edition are somewhat above that of the first edition.<br /><br />The structure of the recent 3rd edition follows that of the \\"classic\\" of programming: \\"The C Programming Language\\", written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie many years ago. A short introductory chapter describing Lua at large is followed by 30 chapters focusing specific areas. The first 10 chapters are about the essential aspects of Lua, but include more \\"advanced\\" issues such as iterators and coroutines. The next 7 chapters are about data structures and OO programming. Another 7 chapters describe Lua's standard libraries, and the last 8 chapters are about Lua's C API and discuss more advanced issues such as threads ans memory management. Many examples and case studies are spread all over the book.<br /><br />The book has about 350 pages, what is still acceptable as a \\"bed lecture\\". Several chapters are a bit short (e.g., the one describing Lua's mathematical library, which essentially is the C standard math library, could have spent half a dozen more pages.) The 3rd edition has about 50 more pages than the 2nd; includes end-of-the-chapter exercises and reflects changes in Lua from version 5.1 to 5.2 (environments/global variables, extended coroutines, bit operations library,...). Overall it is a more polished work than the 2nd edition, and is a very inexpensive book (24 bucks today...), certainly due to Roberto's option of self-publishing. This option doesn't affect the quality: despite having already read a big chunk of the book, I didn't found noticeable typos or errors.<br /><br />A must have book for Lua lovers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fnlun I like the graphics and the whole gem idea hut I wish the horse didn't get tired other than that its pretty fun
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Welcome back to the Clancy we all loved. This is a fast paced thriller with mystery, betrayal, spies galore intrigue & even love. We are seeing Jack Ryan Jr as a rising star in this world. Pretty much taking up where his Dad left off.<br />Don't miss this read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is the best game ever! Right now, you can travel the world on the world tour. It's the ongoing game I call play when I'm traveling cuz it doesn't need the internet. It is the best game that I have! :D
B0062OCNAI|5.0|Even though the subject matter is defined, there are so many loose ends to tie up. Overused frequently but applicable would be the word taut.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game. I love the way they keep updating. With this game it will never get old.I just wish they would allow you to get more coins. Other than that. It's a keeper. Everyone should really get it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this app is super fun for all ages the new features are great this app is very good
B007P06DOK|5.0|I saw a program about how this CD was made by Paul Simon and his trip to Africa to get the music and musicians that performed on this CD the music is real good.
0525952926|5.0|Have followed these families through the years.  The first two were books that I looked forward to reading each evening.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Is it a great novel?  I don't know.  At first I thought it was overrated but then I found myself hooked!  Easy reading, definitely a page turner with good twists.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|complicated search -  rather use Google Chrome  simpler and faster.  for free it is OK.  Maybe some people will find it easier to get to specific sites.  I do not.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This Kindle app keeps updating and sometimes that confuses me!  But it keeps it fresh and it is a nice way to pass time and get frustrations out!
141694737X|5.0|My 1 year old LOVES this book.  We went to the library and he found this book and we had to read it over and over and over (even though we have a copy at home).  He loves the tabs on each page and lifting them to reveal the animal.
0345803507|3.0|After all the media hype, I found the series to be somewhat disappointing. I am not into bondage, etc., and found those<br />parts kind of boring. I realize I seem to be in the minority on this, but the basic story got more interesting in the 2nd and 3rd books. I love a good dirty book as much as the next woman, but the constant references to &#34;Inner Goddess&#34; was boring, and the things they did were so outside of the norm that I found I did not enjoy reading those parts..
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Hotel Transylvania was a great movie for family night. Great voice acting and heart warming plot. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a movie the whole family will enjoy!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This game is fun for the whole family.  A computerized version of &#34;20 Questions&#34; it'll amaze you again and again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is awesome. The graphics are fantastic and there are more obstacles now. You can ride a mine cart and a zip line. The characters are very real looking and so is the setting. The first Temple Run was good, but this is way better. I highly recommend getting this app. You've got nothing to lose, it's fun and free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I found out about subway surfers from my cousin, who had it on her phone. Even though it is very simple, it is also very fun because there are new characters constantly, new boosts, areas, etc. It's also kind of addicting, at least in my opinion. It's a good game to play on the go, and I would definitely recommend it to others.
B0094POVZM|4.0|The was a very good movie. This movie shows you how you  could find youself doing giving the right opportunity doing what you teach aganist. I didn't like the end.
1572814136|3.0|I'm very satisfied with the seller, but as far as the manufacturer goes, why treat the ancient art of the Tarot like Tide and make it new and improved?  They've managed to wash away the charm and authenticity of wonderful artwork by &#34;redoing&#34; it making all the images a litter crisper, more in focus and brightening the colors.  I would have never given up my 30 year old deck except that it had been used so much the cards were sticking together.
B007OWRBJK|1.0|I have been a fan of the Who for most of my life and have great respect for Pete, but his book is dull and you come off feeling sorry for the man who can't seem to grasp how good his life is. Read Keith Richards book instead for a great read.
1608871517|5.0|I have very little time to read because of my very busy worklife but I manage to read 1-2 pages each evening before I go to bed.  I must say reading &#34;The King of Style: Dressing Michael Jackson&#34;  is trully the nicest thing of my day.  The pictures, and the truful recollections of how Michael Bush and Dennis Tompkins dressed Michael Jackson and their friendships is just touching.  I am very thankful for Michael Bush sharing his memorires about The King of Style.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|The Following pilot.  Kevin Bacon is a good actor.  The pilot was interesting, exciting and well written.I think the series will get even better with time.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at this modernized version of the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.  It was nice to see lines or snippets from Doyle's stories make their way into the movie.  The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is wonderfully subtle; the scene with the pair awaiting bail was snicker worthy but also showed the pair's brotherly affection.  Don't expect this movie to hold hard and fast to Doyle's stories but know that this movie does pay homage to Doyle's famous sleuth by dropping actual lines from the tales which the characters either speak or situations they comment on.  Sit back, relax, enjoy this film, then go read the Sherlock Holmes stories.  You won't be disappointed.  Cheers!!  }:O
0765325950|5.0|Great Book! I can't believe how long I waited for the last one! I started reading the series at book 3 and I have had many many days waiting on each book as I read the last one.
0684824906|5.0|They are great books of President Lincoln sometimes to much. This is one you should always read. You learn so much about President Lincoln and with dealing with people and other leaders its the point in life and to be a great leader. I think Mrs. Doris Kearns Goodwin best book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and easy for all ages. I love competing against my kids and we can all have fun at it!
B005D0RDKW|5.0|Always great to see and hear one of the premier bands in the world. With time they only get better.<br />Doc in music and lyrics. Maybe the best blu-ray of 2011.<br />Love it!
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia is an amazing and beautiful book. It has tons of artwork, and also includes the &#34;official&#34; timeline as of now. Overall, a great book for any Zelda fan.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I enjoyed this book while on holiday. It was a good but sometimes strange read but certainly kept the reader intrigued.
0066620996|5.0|Everyone is aiming for integrity these days. The problem is that nobody really knows what the definition is! Well, I can tell you that if you are trying to create a trustworthy and reputable business, you need to be following the studies in this book to the \\"t.\\"<br /><br />Here are some various notes that I've taken from it's pages:<br /><br />-An egotistical leader can build a company quickly but it will lead to mediocrity in the end. This is because egotistical people only care about the personal reward and not how their actions contribute to others.<br /><br />-The best leaders are WILLING and not bashful to fire their family members, because they only want the people that will be the best for the company.<br /><br />-The essential strategy in maintaining a great company is like being a bus driver. You must know how to select the best people and get them on the bus, but also how to get the wrong people off of the bus and replace them with someone who is a performer. People who are not right for the company are a sickness that will infect the top performers and restrict their growth. If everyone on the bus is absolutely right for the company and believes in what they are doing then the company will soar.<br /><br />-Short term thinking: having top performing employees taking slack of poor employees. Long term thinking: firing poor employees and replacing them with new and better performers. This saves money and allows more production and won't cause your top performers to get fatigued so they can blossom.<br /><br />-Good is the nemesis of Great. You should never settle for mediocrity or else the company will never be competitive and will fail to keep up with growing demands and trends. Mediocrity causes people to become lazy and to stop trying and forget what got them success in the first place. When they become complacent they will fail.<br /><br />-Great companies always hire outstanding people and will create positions around them. This is how they prepare for the future.<br /><br />-BAD companies live by the theory that key people should never hire anyone smarter than them because they want to remain secure in their position. The best companies hire the smartest and best and work together to build something great. They recognize that if they hire mediocre employees then the competition will beat their company anyway and their company will fail and they will be out of a job, so why not work with the best people and have the best company that causes other companies to fail? It is the difference between short term and long term thinking.<br /><br />-Hard workers don't stay with your company because of the money: they stay because they cannot settle for less. If you expect the best and set the standard of quality high for the company and the people working there, the best employees will want to work their instead, because of the experience working with the best people and also knowing that they are creating something that they can be proud of. I am sure the best companies still pay their employees well, but this argument is saying that the company doesn't have to worry about the employee leaving just because they got a higher offer at another company. This is how Zappos became great (If you read \\"Delivering Happiness\\" by Tony Hsieh): they actually offered to pay people to leave their company if they were considering joining another company that would pay more. NOW THAT is how you know you have the right people on your team: because they can see the potential in your brand rather than the temporary dollar signs.<br />-\\"When in doubt, don't hire--keep looking\\"<br /><br />-Never quit serving top quality, or customers will start noticing and then lose trust in your company. If you start \\"watering-down\\" your product in order to earn more revenue, you are are short-term thinker and will lose more in the long run.<br /><br />-Walgreens became one of the top USA companies solely because they used a model of creating tight clustersand building a branch close to another one. This is obvious with other franchises such as McDonald's: Even though I personally think that it is annoying to have the same store a few blocks away, the results are staggering.<br /><br />-The best teams are those where the members hold themselves accountable. If you have the best people, they won't settle for a poor performer to do shoddy work. The team polices itself and doesn't wait for a manager to intervene. They create their own punishment and expect the best from each other. They understand that the team is only as strong as its weakest member.<br /><br />I have had the line stick with me forever when Jim Collins' wife said that if she quit her job and dedicated herself fully to competing in triathlons that she would be the best in the world. He then goes on to say that if you are going to do anything then you might as well make sure that you are going to be the best at it--if not, then what is the point in trying and failing? This is a different take on the common phrase: \\"Go big or go home\\" but makes the statement a lot more concrete with a real-world example.<br /><br />I am not sure why I decided to read this book at the young age of 23. I knew that it would be a good book from the review online, but I didn't know that it would be so LIFE CHANGING and relate to me as a person and not just basic corporate mumbo-jumbo. I have yet to open my own business but this book is the main reason why I think that owning a business is the only way to go in America. I am proud that teachings such as this exist and I am grateful for Jim Collins in providing readers with such powerful and inspirational material. Well done!<br /><br />-Ken Flemming<br />Author, How to Get a Job in Video Gamesand building a branch close to another one.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love good scary shows<br /><br />I'm so glad that some of the characters carried over into the new season.  Was afraid I wouldn't want to follow it once I knew that the story line didn't continue on from last season.<br /><br />So glad that I looked into it and I did decide to watch.  Love it.  Not too gory and not that cheesy kind of horror made for tv kind of shows are.  Truly creepy and something I would definitely recommend.  Just my kind of genre - Dean Koontz is my favorite author if that gives you a sense of my taste.
6302212529|4.0|The tape worked perfectly, and it met up yo my expectations. The only problem I have with it is that it is in a sort of beaten up state. But other than that, great!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I am shocked, as many are, that this book would receive a 5 star rating from anybody.<br /><br />I am editing my review, because I finished the book, and I am disgusted with the authorʻs irresponsible handling of the sexual abuse theme. The 17 year old main character finally remembers that her father repeatedly raped her when she was a small child, and then begins her healing by- wait for it- losing her virginity to her boyfriend THAT SAME DAY! Really?? I really hope that the young readers of this book donʻt think thatʻs a good way to handle memories of childhood sexual abuse. Also, the Holder character seems smothering and borderline unstable/abusive himself. Punching lockers? Climbing through her window with no warning? Repeatedly grabbing her wrists? Clamping his hand over her mouth? And heʻs touching her and kissing her shoulder as she confronts her father? I found him disturbing and nearly as creepy as Skyʻs father. The only thing that rings true here is that some abuse survivors repeat the pattern of abuse by becoming involved with other abusive partners. Otherwise, his behavior seems like nothing more than a big collection of red flags to me.<br /><br />My horror at the story line aside, this is also the most poorly written book I have ever read. Bad grammar and vocabulary misuse on almost every page- too many to count. I will say that one of my \\"favorites\\" is Sky being \\"deduced to tears\\". It would be funny if it wasnʻt so sad.

B00A3CVFMM|5.0|I really enjoyed this soundtrack.  Howard Shore did a great job, and I found it well worth the purchase price.  I didn't sample the extended soundtrack, so I can't comment on how it compares to the extended soundtrack.  Some standouts for me included &#34;Misty Mountains&#34; and &#34;Song of the Lonely Mountain&#34;, as well as many others like &#34;Over Hill&#34;.  This is the type of album that I enjoy listening to from start to finish.<br /><br />The soundtracks to the original Lord of the Rings movies set the bar quite high, and for me this one did not necessarily surpass the originals, but I still considered it to be worthy of 5 stars and its purchase price.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Originally published in 2005, I just got around to reading John Scalzi's Old Man's War. So let's start off by saying I wish it had not taken me so long.<br /><br />The opening paragraph of the book's description sets the stage and is a fine hook: \\"John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.\\"<br /><br />This page-turning military sci-fi book is a blast to read. Perry joins the Colonial Defense Force (CDF) and will never return to Earth again (that's a stipulation of the contract), though should he survive the war, Perry will be allowed to live on any of the human colony planets.<br /><br />In Scalzi's future vision, war is constant. Some alien species is always invading and killing off another or trying to or trying to gain control of a planet. Some aliens even engage in battles as religious rites. This book tells the tale of Perry and a few of his friends he meets during the flight to their basic training through that training and a major battle. The plot is straightforward in that sense. Join. Train. Fight here. Fight here. See people die. Fight here. However, Scalzi's imagination is immense, and that straightforward plot feels anything but routine, and his characters have depth and, as inevitably happens, some of Perry's friends die, you kind of wish they had not. Also, Perry's wife was set to join the CDF but died suddenly of a stroke before she turned 75, and Perry remembers her fondly throughout the novel. I say this because it does have a bearing on the story, a part that enriches the overal novel and lifts it from a potentially straightforward plot to a plot with some interesting twists.<br /><br />This is a book that hurtles through its story, and by the end of it, I was wanting more.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great headphones with quality sound and they are very comfortable to wear and easy to use.  I would recommend them.
B006G7YBT2|5.0|I find Don Winslow's books both informative and entertaining and this one is no exception. It is the continuation of the people in the earlier &#34;The Dawn Patrol&#34; and,as such,is part of the evolving story of a group of diverse and interesting people. It is not easy for me to see how another book will follow but I certainly hope that it does. Winslow has a real knack for describing a fluid and developing group of characters. Keep them coming!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Fantastic television with the best Doctor and companion. It's always worth rewatching to see the excellent use of foreshadowing. Buy it!

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Playrix strikes again. I try to avoid anything from Playrix because everything I've played from them sucks hours from my life. This game is no exception. In fact just writing this review makes me want to get to the next level. Gotta run.
B009X010RU|5.0|When I ordered my Kindle 8.9, I wasn't sure what kind of cover I wanted, but I knew that I didn't want something that added bulk and weight to my kindle.  It is heavy enough.  For my original Kindle Fire I bought a Marware cover, and was very happy. So I knew it was going to be a good product.<br /><br />I love this cover. I have had it almost a month, with no issues. It does everything it said it would do, and everything I want it to do.  I love the stand.  It is flimsy without the Kindle in it. Snapped right in with no problems. I will use mine on a lapdesk all the time. I like that it doesn't add the weight and bulk. So when I put it in my bag it doesn't take up extra space.<br /><br />Only part I would improve on is the location of the strap and the way the strap holds the top down when in use.  But still, it isn't a huge issue.<br /><br />Is the cover rubbery, yes.  Was it flimsy when I received it, yes.  I watched the video on how to install it and understood that. If you received it, and are surprised, you didn't do enough research.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this app, but it has an awful lot of ads. Every time you go to the home screen you get a big obnoxious ad right there in your face and can do nothing until its there for a few seconds. If the ads were not there, or at least less frequent, then it would have 5 stars. Other than that this game is extremely fun and I have had no trouble so far... though I would not recommend it for an Android phone. My friend got this app on her phone and it froze her phone up so badly that she had to resort to taking her battery out. As my old teacher used to say \\"That's all folks and thank you for shopping at K-Mart. Come back soon!\\"

B009PJ1Q82|3.0|It's NYC in the late 1990's, where Erik (Thure Lindhardt) is a budding filmmaker from Denmark, supported by his family while working on a documentary for the past four years. While trolling for sex on a phone line, he meets Paul (Zachary Booth), and closeted attorney for a publisher, they discover a sexual and emotional connection, and eventually move in together. Erik is aware, early on, that Paul smokes crack cocaine, but is unaware of how his addiction is growing, to the point where he eventually disappears from his job and their apartment. They manage to stay together for close to a decade, despite Paul's stints in rehab and subsequent failures to maintain his sobriety. Erik sees Paul's failures as a reflection of his own inability to follow-through on things (like his film), and becomes obsessed with \\"saving\\" Paul, despite friends' advice and common sense telling him it just may not happen, despite his best efforts and intentions.<br /><br />Based loosely on a personal experience by the movie's director/co-writer, Ira Sacks, the film's subject matter is obviously rather dark and depressing at times, though realistic for someone going through a rather masochistic relationship with an addict. The acting and technical quality are first rate, although the film's pacing seems to bog down at times, suggesting that more editing would have been an improvement. Film is unrated (would be an R for sexual content, though no complete nudity), and appeared in several film festivals (including Sundance). DVD extras include \\"Making of\\" short, deleted scenes, commentary and auditions. Although this film has gotten a lot of attention, I didn't find it that impressive, and am being generous with three stars out of five.

I sat up late last night, just savoring the atmosphere of this wonderful show.  Tonight I will watch it again with my husband, who is jealous that I got ahead of him!  Next year I will pre-order the new season again.  Best of all, you can't feel guilty when you buy an item that supports Public TV!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first I was like, hmm should I get this? Well I did and I love it. It is currently my favorite game. Be warned it is addicting. The only thing I don't like is that other characters are hard to get. But that is pretty minor and doesn't deserve a full star off. If you want my opinion get it. It will keep you up all night. Best game ever

0316224588|5.0|Rebus is no longer a cop. However he is working as a civilian employee in cold case. He is approached by the mother of a long-missing girl, who asserts that her daughter may be the first victim of an as yet undetected serial killer, whose missing victims are associated with a major Scottish thoroughfare, the A-9.<br /><br />Broadly construing his cold case mandate, Rebus soon finds himself in the middle of a real and current investigation. Along the way he interacts with the gangster Big Ger Cafferty, whose life Rebus saved. Also on the scene is Malcolm Fox of the Complaints who is determined that Rebus must be stripped of any opportunity to rejoin the force now that the retirement age has been raised.<br /><br />As in every Rebus novel, Ian Rankin delivers a most satisfying police procedural. Rebus is, as Fox repeated is told, \\"old school.\\" To Fox this is the kind of charter that doesn't belong in contemporary police work. To those who know, Rebus gets results and his methods are less important than his solve rate.<br /><br />Standing In Another Man's Grave is a book you will put down only at the last page. It is terrific.

You remember your feelings to be the king of the trail, to be sort of a pilgrim along the Silk road, wherever you are and whatever the Silk road is for you. The need, just after ending the book, at seven o'clock in this sunday morning, to go downstairs to find your old boots and go. To restart to be a seeker...

B001P5M7QE|5.0|This is quintessential Monty Python and an excellent example of the genre.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a very high class telenova with first rate acting and a compelling storyline. The settings and costumes are lavish, a feast for the eyes. The editing is disjointed at times, but this could be due to the large sweep of time this saga is trying to cover. Not to be missed!

B009FBX5M0|2.0|This CD DOES NOT INCLUDE the theme song which is performed by Adele. I have to agree with several other posters about this being a huge letdown. How absurd is it to release a soundtrack and not include the song with which the film is identified ?<br />Marketing gimmick and a rip-off. I had read the names of the tracks on this CD, and saw that one of the tracks is titled Skyfall and mistakenly assumed that this was Adele's performance. Don't make the same mistake I did. Will be returning this.

B009346RSS|1.0|I bought a new TV (Panasonic VIERA) and discovered that I need a converter to reconnect to my existing sound system.<br /><br />I bought this one. Worked fine. Was very happy with it. Then after a few weeks the thing went bad, produced distorted sound. I got another one. Same story. Finally it dawned on me that it was permanently powered up. So I tried disconnecting the power feed, letting it cool off. And then it went back to working OK. Now whenever I wanted to watch TV I had to first go and plug in the USB power cable; when I was done watching, I had to go and unplug it. I was a slave to this overheating $25+ piece of junk.<br /><br />Enough is enough. I shopped around and bought an [[ASIN:B008EPW7TA Orei DA21]]. Seems to be a superior product. It automatically detects whether input is optical or co-axial (the FiiO requires you to set a switch); in addition to the RCA outputs, it also has a 3.5mm headphone output; and the sound it produces is louder and clearer. For the time being it certainly outperforms the FiiO.<br />==================<br />Well, it's now been a bit over 2 weeks that I'm using the Orei. Awesome improved sound (compared to the FiiO). Moreover, it's been permanently plugged in and no sign of overheating or misbehavior (by now the FiiO would require being unplugged and allowed to cool).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the  story .  I couldn't put it down. I finished all three books in less than a week.  Great read!!!
B0058VW36U|3.0|This is just another app I downloaded. I don't know why Amazon is requiring that a review is given. I wish they allowed this to be deleted and not clutter up my review list.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Have read all of the Reacher books I can get from library, love audio books now starting with Amazon for my Kindle, Amazing adventure and action stories, Hard to find another author to match Child!!<br />Hesitated to see the Reacher movie, thought Cruise had not a chance to match my idea of what Reacher would look like, but he did a good job, but fell way, way, SHORT of my image of Jack!!!!
B003IDMUX6|2.0|But as book progressed it became a typical primary school read. Am an avid John Grisham reader.<br />This is one I would not recommend.<br />Man this one could have gone so many fantastic places. It fizzled out.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|convouluted plot, everytime you thought you got it, he surprised you.  How he thinks of all his plots and twists and turns is amazing!!  Great read, one of the best
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|...if you like formula movies, you will not be disappointed in this third installment of the MIB series.  Aside from a few plot points which appear to be unexplained even within the context of the movie, it is still an enjoyable, light-weight bit of entertainment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome!! you can do almost everything (will be everything and more after updates come out)  that you can do on computer...but it cost less and is mobile! was skeptically to pay 7 dollars for an app, but it is comepletely worth it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is he best game I have ever played. It is better than Temple Run. I would never ever delete this game from my kindle.You guys should do Subway Surfers in London. Please do take my idea and make one in London.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|When watching tv and trying to figure out some episodes, it was nice to get this package. The reruns aren't always shown<br />is sequence. Also it is good to go back and review some episodes to see what one misses in the first place.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|I haven't yet seen the movie but love the sound track.  I need more words before I can submit this.
B008B92U32|2.0|When u cut the head off one person to put it on another tou can edit it in any way ..sucks<br /><br />Thank god I got it for free thats y I gave it to starz if I paid for it its zero stars
B001B6PBBK|1.0|I couldn't make it past the first 10 minutes of this movie, it was beyond annoying. Brittany Murphy's \\"accent\\" really turned me off.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|A fun way to use some time. Graphics are pretty good. I will buy from Big Fish games again. Thanks.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is thrilling. It makes you feel like you were right there next to Percy Jackson. It has twists and turns. There is a surprise waiting around every corner. I highly recommend this book.
B008YCW19Y|5.0|Ok if you are reading this you are not asking or looking to gain insight as to wether this is a great LP.<br /><br />Here is what you may want to know: Vinyl is clean and clear. Quiet and the LP sounds great.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a book everyone should read.  It is from a brain surgeon and his experience with death and the other side.<br />What an encouraging and scientific read for all.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I really enjoyed season 1 and could hardly wait for season 2.  I was hooked on Downton Abbey in the first few minutes of season 1.  The copy was really good, you would have thought I was watching the original TV presentation.
B0077G2X5K|4.0|This book reveals a lot about the Institutional Mentality (or what the authors call the institutional imperative- a theme carefully woven into each chapter of the book) and how the small investor can exploit its obvious and inherent weaknesses.  What is the Institutional Mentality?  The Institutional Mentality is a malady characterized by the following tell-tale signs and symptoms:<br /><br />1.  The possession of a mandate that limits what you can do, specifically- what sort of outfits you can pursue as investments, how big these outfits can be, and how much money you can throw at each outfit<br /><br />2.  The possession of a large, and often growing, pile of funds with which to invest<br /><br />3.  The possession of a few good ideas, but not nearly enough for the amount of funds that you have available to invest<br /><br />4.  The inability to devote time, resources and brainpower to research every nook and cranny of the market in the search for suitable ideas/investments<br /><br />5.  The longing to look like a genius or a guru; however, this natural and important desire is checked by the greater desire to avoid looking stupid when  all is said and done and performance reviews are due<br /><br />The typical treatment regimen for the Institutional Mentality is as follows:<br /><br />1.  Actively mimic the competition in all things.  So, this means that if everyone is into AAPL, you're into it, too.  And if everyone is using hedging and borrowing stock to dress up year-end portfolio results, you are, too.  (what Dreman calls the herd mentality and Buffett refers to as the impetus to adopt lemming-like behavior)<br /><br />2.  Diversify- even amongst those things you know little or nothing about.  This will ensure mediocrity.<br /><br />3.  Spread funds around so as to limit potentially embarrassing losses (and on the flip-side, limit potentially lucrative, out-sized gains).  This will ensure that the stated objective of investing is not achieved.  (Croupiers fear not, for you will be obscenely compensated for failing your 'clients' and your fiduciary responsibility.  Small investors should be very fearful, as this is the retirement money and the kids' college fund we are handling- see the last sentence on Page 158.)<br /><br />Value Investing goes on to reveal the theory and practice behind one approach to investing, and the many subtle variations that a few of its more famous practitioners bring to it.  It accurately details how the approach has deviated from that of The Father of Value Investing, Benjamin Graham, who sought his so-called `net-net stocks' (stocks which are valued solely based on their balance sheets- specifically, based on their current assets less all their liabilities, current and non-current), and morphed into the various flavors as practiced by many devotees of the approach circa Y2K.  Along the way, it also spends a lot of time successfully slaying the sacred cows of modern portfolio theory, discounted cash flow analysis (and the ever-present growth projections that come with it) and the elusive hunt for growth.  Additionally, it also makes a good, solid case for fundamental analysis, which, oddly enough, is up-ended by the profiles of a few of the value investors profiled in-depth who basically eschew it and the one lone value investor who swears by discounted cash flow analysis- the very technique for which the authors have a dim view.  In passing, the authors waited until nearly the end of the book to present their take (and an adequate and succinct one at that) on the differences between contrarian investing and value investing, something which I personally feel should have been addressed in detail at the beginning of the book.<br /><br />The approaches presented function best when evaluating the worth of companies that make use of tangible, physical assets to produce wealth (though they may need to make significant investments in knowledge capital beforehand via research and development and thentranslate that knowledge through physical capital into a tangible product).  In general, I found the book lacking in specifics on how to evaluate those highly profitable outfits whose principal assets are intangibles in the form of computer code, accumulated data and other forms of knowledge capital that do not as a rule require significant investments in physical plant (and the use of associated debt capital) in order to produce wealth.<br /><br />In addition to covering the institutional imperative and outlining the basic underpinnings of value investing, the book also provides two thoroughly worked examples using the fundamental principles of value investing as well as profiles of a few of the leading lights- the luminaries- of value investing.  These luminaries all put their own idiosyncratic spin on value investing.  Some emphasize comparable sales (of assets or whole companies), while others emphasize growth within the context of an identifiable franchise.  Still others focus solely on the balance sheet, while others focus on earnings power value.  A couple focus squarely on negative sentiment combined with an eye on either assets or earnings, while others look for catalysts or motivated sellers (here for reasons that have little or nothing to do with the present or future prospects of the outfit).<br /><br />Overall, I found the book to be a very worthwhile read, considering 1) the length of time it took me to read it (almost three months), 2) how many times I had to stop and re-read certain sections, 3) how many passages I underlined within the book, 4) the volume of notes I took when reading the book and 5) the complete, 180-degree reversal I had in my thinking and approach to investing after reading this book.  I would have to say that I learned a few new tricks (and also uncovered a few new traps) while reading this book, and while I am always partial to Buffett's take on value investing (his terse words on the nature of earnings alone are priceless, and confirms everything I have been saying to folks about the market and certain stocks of late), even Buffett had to show the proper respect to Schloss & Schloss, two balance-sheet-centric value investors whom Buffett admired for achieving extraordinary results with little in the way of resources beyond a list of willing clients of modest means and a proven method, learned underneath the feet of The Master's Master, Ben Graham.  Next up on my list is to read everything I can on Schloss & Schloss.<br /><br />Readers with an interest in the topic of value investing in practice should consult Kirk Kazanjian's [[ASIN:B000I5YURQ Value Investing with the Masters]], and Ronald W. Chan's [[ASIN:1118339290 The Value Investors: Lessons from the World's Top Fund Managers]].translate that knowledge through physical capital into a tangible product).

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game...love the challenges..keeps me entertained for hours....son loves it also....hard to put down...plays great on the Kindle Fire!!!! not much more I can say about...you must try it...
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is totally amazing! The best thing of this game is the daily challenge.If you want you can find letters to unlock money.If you find all the letters till day 5,you can get the super mystery box!The super mystery box is a mystery box that has so much more than a ordinary mystery box.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Acting was what you would expec, very good and it had an entertaining story line. Nothing too heavy here but a good one. Yes you can predict some of it but it is a good one none the less.
0486409511|4.0|An excellent instructional book! The author has done a nice job of showing what Copperplate is and how it is different from other types of calligraphy. She also has some good practice projects included. It is worth purchasing.
1616550414|5.0|This is the most comprehensive source on Zelda available. We had an interview with the editor, Patrick Thorpe, on our podcast and his story of how he got involved after years of contacting Nintendo, adds a hole new layer of appreciation to the book. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Joe, Geeks With Wives
B009R5GR1K|4.0|I bought two other dictionaries for my Kindles and both were very slow; THE FREE DICTIONARY+ by Farlex is great. Not only does it get to the word I want quickly, it gives the etymology as well. Unlike the other two dictionaries I had, the Farlex dictionary offers suggestions if one misspells the word. I used to tell my kids to look up the word that they asked me to spell for them. Their reply was, &#34;If I knew how to spell it I would not need to look it up.&#34;  You know, there's some wisdom in that.<br /><br />The only hangup is that it is interactive with the internet and when I'm not &#34;connected,&#34; it's not useable.  Small price to pay for such an inexpensive application.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's a fun game and my husband thinks that he can beat my scores but he can't. I just don't like that sometimes it cuts off so fix that please and you'll be better.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My Grandsons all 5 0f them like to play this game on myKindleFire if they like it and it is non-violent then I like it.
B009QAOV14|5.0|Great to see this one re-issued and on what is a very clear and well mastered vinyl version. If you are a Beck fan you know this is a great album so this is just a note that the vinly is great!
B006WQLH7G|4.0|it works well, i love the web interface. i can log into the website and see exactly where my phone is and make it call me.  i have avast on most of my computers so this was the next logical step.
B003CN4R74|5.0|Their first album was very good, but this album is great. If they come out with more like this, they could become one of my favorite groups of all time.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I was sceptical about reading this book after it was recommended to me by a friend. The whole concept of a future world where people kill each other for reality tv seems very elaborate and extreme to me. I found it hard to get into for the first couple of chapters but after that I was hooked.<br />The book is very well written that even someone who isn't a big fan of violence, blood and other such things can still read it without cringing!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's definetly better than the first one, but sometimes when I hit save me, it goes back to the homescreen and I lose what I just did. I had a highscore of three million, then when I hit save me, BAM. its gone. it doesn't save the score nor the gems and coins I just earned. this problem needs to be fixed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i GOT THIS FOR MY GRANDSONS THEY SEEM TO LIKE IT SINCE THEY ARE ALL UNDER THE AGE OF 9  AS LONG AS THE GAME IS NON-VIOLENT I LIKE IT
B0085FS3S8|5.0|They hit a homerun with this one. The vinyl is clear and sounds great. This even with the colored vinyl.
B0079KGAOY|4.0|On three, or one two three then go?  absolutely timeless.  I thought these would be cheesy and loose something over time, but they do not.  Fantastic movies and great to watch again even now.  and the whole collection on Blu-ray? for about $10 a movie?  well worth it.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Really can't get enough of this group. I am just counting the minutes to the next album. Every album tops the last one.
B00999DFP0|5.0|My only complaint is with myself because I should have read the description more closely: this is a bundle, not a boxed set.
1616550414|5.0|I love love LOVE the Legend of Zelda and couldn't be more excited for this amazing book. It has amazing concept art from every single game, a timeline of the story, a beautiful green hardcover.. ANY Zelda fanatic should have this book in their possession!<br /><br />The corners of the book were dented a bit but I'm a crazy fan who wants their stuff in 100% mint like condition so it's okay.
B00B5D32XS|5.0|This show is amazing. Jessica Lang is one of the best actress' I have watched in a while.  All of the actors were great. They all bring their own flair. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00AF6B2BK|5.0|I am getting the whole set, of course. I have not been reviewing these as they come out but thought maybe I would offer a quick note:<br /><br />Yes they are picture discs that normally have way too much surface noise. In the case of every vinyl copy I have thus far, they are great.<br /><br />Little surface noise on the start and end of a album (well let’s face it much of the vinyl being produced today regardless of picture or not has that), that is present here.<br /><br />Now, we are talking Maiden here and the sound quality is great and it is metal, so if there is some minor surface noise you can’t hear it. I am not playing it on a crappy system so if it was there I would hear it. No taking away from the enjoyment on this set thus far.
B005R32L66|3.0|it seems to work well, but it also seems to be a bit resource hungry. also the volume on the phone calls seems quiet.  i wish i could turn it up a bit more.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|I was surprised. I knew their were some good songs on this album before I bought it, but I did not realize it was packed with hits.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Daniel Craig gets my vote as the best Bond (despite my wife's love for Connery). I bought this combo pack as we transition from DVD to Blu-ray.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this series.  I cannot believe there are so many negative reviews.  These are some of the best characters.  You get drawn into the story and cannot put the book down.  I have read the series several times and enjoy it every time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|There is many horses to choose from and you can play with other peoples horses as well. There is many different ways to take care of your horse I which you can receive money.
B0084YM1S8|5.0|Ok if you are reading this you are not asking or looking to gain insight as to wether this is a great LP.<br /><br />Here is what you may want to know: Vinyl is clean and clear. Quiet and the LP sounds great.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|aahhh.. unnnnn....  aaaarrrr.r.......<br /><br />totally hooked on this show, just wish there were more episodes per season.  can not get enough.
B005R32L66|4.0|I enjoyed the video call. It is nice way to keep in touch with someone. I recomend this as a way to contact those important to you.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|It's the movie my wife and I love, so I got the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack as we transition from DVD to Blu-ray.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just love it!  I have wateched seasons one and two and waited for season 3 all summer and fall.  My only compaint is that Shirley McClaine was given such a small role.  Would have loved to have seen more of her.  Can't wait to download the next installment.  It was my one extra motivation to purchas Amazon Prime.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its so much fun. I love it! I would get this, it is fun to take care of the horses and train them.
B00920HMNM|5.0|Well, this one shocked me. I expected a good album but this one is a gem. The clear vinyl is quiet and sounds good. There is not a clunker song on this one! Bravo!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is now the second time I have read this book and each time you read it you understand more and more!! This book is even more intense the second time through!!!!! All I wanted to do was sit there and read certain parts over and over  again and just take in all the intensity!!!!! I have to go now I'm going to read it again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My wife loves this game. It is quite entertaining and she has a lot of fun with it. Easy to play.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This is a very good book it's the best book I have ever read you need to read the whole series
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Subway Surfed was a very addicting game and I absolutely loved it. Until one day I bought a stack of 7,500 coins and I never got it. Since it was only $0.99 I didn't worry about it so I tried to buy the same pack layer but I still never received it. This really ticked me off considering I almost NEVER buy any in app purchases.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is great,when you start playing you can't stop and put it down its a really good way to spend time when your bored.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Look, here is the bottome line I ordered two and one was crap with all the problems people are complaining about. The other was fine.<br /><br />I would simply take advantage of the fact Amazon is a great company and allows free refunds. Heck order two and make a good set out of them if you have to. Why? The sound is really good as is the mastering for the vinyl release.<br /><br />I do hope as we all do though that the mono set is not trusted to a junk facility after all the work put into it.<br /><br />Anyway are there issues? Heck yea. Can you with patience get a good set? Yes.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|The game is entertaining but ads keep popping up. These advertisements make my kindle fire freeze. As a result the game moves very slowly. Just to go to the store I have o wait a few minutes while my kindle freezes and unfreezes. Sometimes this cause my kindle to stop working altogether and I have to shut it down and turn it on again. I do not like what this game is doing to my kindle. Playing it is just not worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game most people think that these games you dont have to think but it takes alot of thinking.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks and Richard Paul Evans is my favorite authors. I haven't read this book yet but is on my kindle.<br />I'm sure its a winner as all of Nicholas Sparks books are. I better get busy and read it as the movie is about to be released and that is a must see.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I used to read Stephen King up until The Stand and then he got a little &#34;out there&#34; or maybe my imagination wasn't what it used to be.  I have not read any books by him in many years.  I was quite surprised by this book.  There is a lot to think about and it is a page turner.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone no matter what genre they usually read.<br /><br />i would recommeb=nd this gbook to everyone no matter what genre the usually read
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show! I keeps me sucked in every time! Just wish here in US we could get the whole season 3 instantly on prime for no extra cost.
B008Z9L94O|5.0|Ok, some of the reviews are more about opinions about Billy and these re-issues (to be or not to be re-mastered). Certainly there seems to be a few folks with versions that had pressing issues. Last time I checked Amazon allows free returns and exchanges. Ok, enough sais about those and that complaint.<br /><br />I received a clean copy and found the new mastering excellent. If you want to get the original on vinyl they are out there. I know prior to this release a mint copy was $200 to $500 so go get that if you are that concerned with the original release. Let’s also be clear this was never not are the other Pumpkins vinyl re-issues advertized as the original mix!<br /><br />I actually like this better and think Billy did a great job on all thus far.<br /><br />I respect those who don’t like it but I also don’t think that it is getting a fair shake.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It fun better then temple run you should get this and the game will prove it self that its better then temple run
B005K17RU0|5.0|As a mason and snow removal specialist, it's imperative I get accurate weather forecasts. This app is more accurate than my local news station. 'Nuff said.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|LinkedIn is a great idea, but the iPhone app lacks functionality and the website changes with no real explanation of where things have gone or when functionality may return such as the SlideShare app.
B0015AARJI|5.0|works great. Real Sony controller. came in on time. kids stole it right out of my hands. would order again
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|Awful! Painful and a terrible version of a capable piece of work! Great concept for a musical film but actors who can actually sing would have been a smarter choice!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really cool game really good game s ash go fireworks cost jellyfish disk Inc Fla gsm slog deck I deck push Inc cool is data vs kg  h Finland g jerks did foreign
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game, i am always playing this! Everyone should get this game, this is better than Temple Run.
0374533571|5.0|I liked this book.  A friend of mine saw the movie and said she didn't like it.  So, I decided to get the book to see what I thought of the story.  It's a very fast read and kept my interest throughout.  Based on the book I now want to see the movie, but I can wait until it comes out on Netflix.  It's nothing deep but I liked the characters and their journey toward a silver lining.
B005CWRB44|5.0|This is my new favorite light!! Very compact and lightweight for a great price. I carry it on my keychain everyday and find myself using it consistently. Excellent lumen output, beam range and superb battery life. I've dropped it on asphalt several times and it has taken the beating like a champ!
0061989142|5.0|i have both book by her (Style and Beauty) and have read all her other books she has out. This has great, practical, easy tutorial how to's and I love going back to it to &#34;refresh&#34; my style.
B006LS7DQE|4.0|this is a good puzzle game with many hours of fun , however this kindle version does freeze up on you . the glitches can be very annoying . I had read where others had to reload game i haven't had to do that , but i did need to put it down and come back to it the next  day for the game to reset itself out of the glitch .<br />For the price its a good game, but it seems you get what you pay for here with putting up with the glitches.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|it works great with my kindle fire to download music and videos! now I don't need a PC to download anymore songs :)
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I didn't think it possible... but literally it is like my portable league on a tablet. It is great haha
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I chose this rating because it is not the best book I have ever read but it is better than the original &#34;Fifty Shades.&#34; The first book left me wanting more and this one did not dissapoint. I am not finished with it yet but I will buy the last in the series. Honestly I am kind of tired of the constant sex two or three times in every chapter. I believe the author can really write and this is kind of a crutch. I am enjoying this book and maybe this is what hooked me in the first place but now I am kind of over that part. I like the &#34;vanilla sex&#34; better than all the slap and whip. It makes me quite uncomfortable when someone else is in the room and I am trying to read. I would recommend this book to my friends but not my mother...or my preacher!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great graphics and very appealing to my opinion of fun. connection is very smooth which makes the game ten times more enjoyable. I just dislike games that will put you in a situation to where you have to buy something to keep on playing and this game has some of that but not very noticeable.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is so hard and works muscles you forgot or didnt know you had! I got through about 5 days and had to take off a few days before being able to get back to it. Thanks Jillian!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it's very entertaining. My four year old heifer likes to challenge me. Can't say enough just try it.<br />It also help keep the Kids quiet while riding in the car. It's like no one want's to wait their turn.
B0002CVQCW|5.0|This concert performance has the best of the best.  The best Jean Valjean, the best Fantine, the best Javert, the best Marius......and so on.  Cosette was very good, but perhaps not the very best.  The Thenardiers were perfectly sleazy, especially Monsieur.  The music haunts you and gets into your mind and stays there.  I just wish that the same themes didn't repeat so often.  The music itself is original, but within the musical it isn't.  However, all things considered, this is a wonderful performance of one of the best of the best.
B004V9T19W|5.0|Love the movie and the extras, ten year old loved it as well! We've already watched it several times. Boy was a little bummed that the cycle couldn't roll, but I already guessed as much.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I chose this rating because I totally love it, I love it, I Iove it! This is so addictive that I could sit up all night and play if I could find enough people to play with me. I found out that I can draw fairly well. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who likes art or colors. Anyone who can read the words can play this game. I would give it 10 stars if I could! There is only one game I find as addictive as this one and I play them back to back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun. At first I thought it would be boring but once I,played it for the first time, I was addicted. I showed it to my Mom and she has more points than I do now. THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AMAZING. 5 STARS NO DOUGHT
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Fan my whole life and am old enough to have seen the original in the theater in 1977. Could care less about Lucas' changes. Frankly, they all tie the movies together to create a better flow. DTS HD Master audio is incredible and the picture quality is amazing. This is the 3rd time I've watched all 6 movies consecutively with this set and I enjoy it more every time. If you have decent home theater, this is a must have. Buy it and you won't regret it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Its very cliff hanging which I enjoy.  You had to read fast to see what would happen<br />and then you were surprised
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I miss games like this!  A really fun game.  It has the Mario Brothers feel and just what I wanted.  Very easy controls and great graphics.  Works great on my kindle fire.  Worth it :) Thanks!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Love the movie and the extras, ten year old loved it as well! We've already watched it several times both versions.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I have nothing to say because it is just a dictionary<br />I have nothing to say because it is just a dictionary
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so adorable . I would recommend this game to anyone unless you are a guy that would just be weird unless you are  a five year old then that would be cute.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this and fell in love with the characters. Sparks knows how to pull at peoples heartstrings.. and he has created another beautiful novel
B0054JZC6E|5.0|jhhjj<br />kik<br />kjj<br />jjj<br />kgyhgf<br />uhf  hug  Bhutanese ghhj jiii hub hbb hhh hj  jjjgg gggh hhhh hhhhY vhhh hhhh hhhh bhhh hh
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down! College Hoover really knows how to tell a story. A must read for everyone! Loved it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Except for the crashes like not opening to play, I love it.  Scrat's king fu is a pain in my button though.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|My rate is stars 123 because there's more games better than this.I want the angry birds in space.Its sometimes fun to play.So that is my opinion
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have this game and its so fun!! for free you get 100+ games!! I recommend to get it. for free its worth it. you get a good deal and get to have fun while playing it!
0307895475|5.0|The book is described very well but I have to say when it arrived it is so much better in person. AMAZING
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the 5 hour version and so much better than the 3 hour movie that was put in the theaters a few years ago.  The acting is tremendous and it really builds the characters extremely well!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|The Blu Ray version of Midnight was way above my expectations, the sound and picture quality was crisp and superb and the background music was delightful. I had seen the same movie on the conventional DVD, but it pales in comparison to the Blu ray version. This movie is special for people like me, who love everything which is old - old classic movies, old music. The story is not a conventional one, like all Woody Allen movies, but I would not like to reveal the story, because it will spoil all the fun in watching this wonderful movie. The performances of the entire cast, the photography was way above average.<br />After watching the movie, I went out and purchased the movie soundtrack CD.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|It is a very moving movie, that covers different key aspects of life (love, loyalty, feelings vs the-right-thing-to-do, etc). I could not stop crying at the end. But remember this is a film so DO NOT compare your love life to it. Just enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is a ok game but the daily challenges do not work well in fact they don't work in gennerel
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very interesting game. When I explain it to people I always say,  you know temple run right? Then I will say play subway surfers now because it's  temple run but better and more adictting and you can not stop playing. GET SUBWAY SURFERS NOW!!!!!!!!
B002JIEYLC|5.0|Released in 1975, Sabotage is what many fans consider the original Sabbath's last truly great album(although myself and a few others enjoy Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die for what they are). This is without a doubt one of Sabbath's best records, each member is at their peak. Ozzy never sounded so into his performance than on here, Bill and Geezer are bombastic and Tony coming up with some of the most heavy, influential riffs of all time. It's unfortunate that the heavy drug and alcohol use tolled on the band so much to where it started to effect the music from now until the end of the decade.<br /><br />Now this edition is from Sanctuary, released in 2009. As with some of the Deluxe Editions, the sound quality on this version is peculiar, as it sounds much better than the original Warner Bros. disc, but compared to the Castle remaster and the overtly compressed Black Box remaster, it sounds much softer. Not necessarily a bad thing(better than being maxed out and nothing to do about it), but it did take me by surpise. So if you're looking for an improvement over the original but not something that'll hurt the ears, this is probably the best bet or the Castle remaster(although those were never authorized by the band, and I'm not even quite sure if this version is or not.) I hope the next remasters will be of the Tony Martin IRS material.
1781163243|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for someone who's a frequent player of Halo and fan of the story.  The book has a lot of content, with a wealth of artwork that anyone can enjoy.  Definitely a good purchase for any fans who appreciate the artwork that goes into these sorts of productions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really nice graphics, great gameplay, some (but minor) crashes. I suggest this game for players 8-any age (but everybody  can play). It is a great game for building! However, could Amazon please update this to 6.1?
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's good but they came out with  new update I'm hoping amazon will get the update like on Google play
B00APUYWYA|2.0|Although most of the singing was enjoyable, I didn't enjoy having my 14 yr olds ears/mind being subjected to the constant barrage of innuendos and inappropriate language and clothing. The world is full enough of all that crap without adding one more place to PAY to see it.
B000TDGGRY|4.0|Started out as an usual adventure, but took a totally different path. One that made me ask questions, not just leave to someone's over imagination.
0988262592|5.0|Gene Kim and team create a realistic company in Parts Unlimited that has the same challenges that all business have in trying to release and deploy applications.<br /><br />People who should read this book:<br />CEO<br />CIO<br />COO<br />VP/director of Application Development<br />VP/director of IT<br />VP of Sales<br />VP of Marketing<br />And everyone who works for them.<br /><br />Great job Gene and Team.  I am looking forward to reading the DEVOPS Cookbook
145210655X|5.0|I bought this for a new father who's a Star Wars fan and it was enjoyed.  I had a chance to read through the book before giving it to him, and it was enjoyable even for a non-parent!  Great gift idea!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game my only problem is it keeps shutting down on me when i use a diamond or die after 200,000 so I don't get the coins I collect and I loos  my diamonds who when I didn't even get saved it just shut down I am getting very annoyed I love  this game and want to keep playing but not if this keeps happening...
0871164566|5.0|I love this book. Kimberly out did herself. This book is so easy to follow that I think any beginner should have no problem making the projects in this book. It covers any scenario you could possibly run into in wire wrapping. Also the price is great considering how much helpful info is in this book. I have never seen such a wonderful book on wire wrapping. I am so glad I purchased it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is starting out a good show. Fast paced, packed with stuff to think about. You walk away waiting for the next show. I hope it stays as good as this
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My opinion is that it is better than the first one! A huge monkey is chasing you!!!!!!!!<br />That is so cool right? What better can you get?
B003LD9P4K|5.0|A great show. it does show some flaws in Emersons playing but overall a very good show. I recommend it to all ELP fans.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I simply love this game. Got on board late but haven't turn back yet, have been playing for awhile and it still has my interest.
B0068RQ85K|5.0|Couple of nice things about this coiling gizmo - it clamps on the work surface and has five different sizes of coiling rods.  It is easy to use.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Frank Ocean is the kind of singer that comes along to break the monotony of the same old music.  His music is compelling, imaginative and a breath of fresh air compared to the sound-alike mass produced electronically enhanced vocals of today.  My personal faves on this album are Super Rich Kids and Sweet Life.  Sweet Life has Pharell's patented touch and has that N.E.R.D. feel to it (side note, I wish N.E.R.D. would return to this type of airy soaring music instead of the style of their last album, Nothing).  If you like mellow smooth vocals along with creative musical arrangement Overall, this is the kind of album I can play start to finish without hitting the forward button on my device.  His music is best for relaxing or taking a nice drive.  Keep on releasing good music Frank.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great read. Loved the new book and new line of books to come. Story was engaging and a fun story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was just begging my mom for this game!!! She just had 2 get it! In seconds I was playing on it. At first I was just destroying it but then I knew what 2 do.<br />  I built 5 houses in 2 days.<br />  I personally think that that if you don't get it you are missing out on the best game yet!!! So get it or miss out out on a totally fun game!!! O and this game deserves a 5 star rating!!!<br />  Mojang is an excellent game designer!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it so much!!! It is the best game I have ever played in my life! Totally worth the $ 6: 99. It is so entertaining with everything you can build with. BY IT, BY IT, BY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0736092269|5.0|This book is amazing. If you want to see anatomical pictures that will assist you in your training then this book is the way to go. Also the descriptions are concise and down to precision
1454701250|5.0|Todo a sido perfecto. Ha llegado antes de lo previsto y en perfectas condiciones. No tengo ninguna queja, muy al contrario.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|There's only 4 characters, they got rid of the &quot;invisibility&quot; power-up, the gems are impossible to get (with only 1 or 2 appearing every ten minutes). I honestly prefer the original. This was a flop. The tilting in a minecart is unresponsive, you can only choose from 3 objectives at a time (you have to do the challenges in order). Stick with the original. The new shop menu is confusing.
B000P6PVLC|1.0|Wow, just wow.  And I thought I had ADD.  When I am old and gray at death's door I will still be upset about watching this movie.  The trailer did not really describe the movie accurately.  This movie was pointless, much of the \\"drama\\" that was created was completely avoidable.  If my spouse is ever shot in a foreign country I will make sure I stand around fighting with the locals rather than trying to get him to a hospital myself (the bus, maybe?).  The link between the Japanese and Americans is weak at best.  ***SLIGHT SPOILER*** What are the odds of one family finding themselves in life-threatening situations at the same time in two separate foreign countries?  And during the 16 years the housekeeper has lived in the US, she never considered becoming a citizen?  Another Hollywood gem condemning guns and sympathizing with the plight of illegal aliens.  Tired.
B005FITIDC|5.0|Machine gun preacher is the tale of a modern day saint named Sam Childers, a former drug dealing, drug addicted hillbilly biker from eastern Pennslyvania who after he's released from prison. He goes home to discover his wife a former junkie/stripper has become a born-again christian and he's reluctant to accept the faith, until one night he beleives he killed a man with his best freind. This drives him to sobreity and to being baptised into the faith, he then makes his own contracting business, builds his family a proper house, and builds a church that he has to be pastor of. Childers then goes to Southern Sudan and is so enraged at the horrors heaped on the populaces children forced to serve as child soldeirs that he builds an orphanage for them and starts doing rescue ops to retreive children from the Sudanese muslims. Childers garners a reputation from the people as being enchanted and commanding great power, but his actions start to take a toll on his sanity and relationships with his family and freinds. Definetly a man you'd send money to, and definetly a movie to see.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Cute and a story line that is very common amongst couples who have been married a long time! Two perfect actors for the parts!!
B0000024JN|5.0|I had been contemplating in buying this particular album for many years because I had always found a copy to be too expensive than most CD albums. First, the album has a unique and catchy style when compared to its contemporaries at that time. While most rap music at that period were mostly filled with profane insulting lyrics and violent themes, the &#34;Beastie Boys&#34; were almost a parody. Second, it always feels fresh because a listener can easily understand the songs' lyrics and still able to be very entertaining at the same time. Lastly, the assorted but atypical pieces in the background (for that time) really stood out. Blasting this album's music inside someone's (closed-windows) car at full base and stereo speakers still brings some head-boppin' even after all these years.
1401227821|5.0|Todo a sido perfecto. Ha llegado antes de lo previsto y en perfectas condiciones. No tengo ninguna queja, muy al contrario.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good way to kill some time. This game has great graphics and is a really cute game for horse lovers.
1616550414|5.0|First of all, if you are a zelda fan, there is no question that you should buy this.  Eventually, they will release a paper back version of this, so i would buy the hardcover before they quit making it.<br /><br />The english version contains the same content as the japanese version, the main difference is that the english version is considerably larger.  The book itself contains concept art from all 16 main games with notes, a chronology of the series, the official timeline, description of key plot points, a skyward sword manga and comments from the two main producers of the series.  There is 238 pages not including the manga.<br /><br />The only negative that I can think of is that the cover feels cheap, other then that the content within the book is amazing.  I have both the japanese and english version, unless you want to carry it around in your book bag (its too large), there is no reason not to get this version (unless you only read japanese obviously), it is better in just about every way.<br /><br />On a side note, I would like to thank Dark Horse Comics for taking a chance and shipping the english version.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|A friend of mine told me about this APP.  It offers a great way to organize your life in one place - like having a personal secretary.  I gave it a four because it's a little hard to learn how to use it, but I'm tech-challenged.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a well written mystery in which the author does an excellent job of taking us into the mind of the narrator Andy Barber and through him we see some excellent observations on a marriage, a character with skeletons in the closet, early teens in today's world, politicians and just everyday life.<br /><br />The mystery itself is well thought out and original and the courtroom scenes are more realistic  than most books from this genre.  You'll be surprised by the ending and it leaves you a little to think about and solve for yourselfat the end.  This is not necessarily an action filled book but it is captivating because of the characters and the twists and emotional roller coasters throughout.<br /><br />The book does get a bit long winded and repetitive in the period between arrest and trial but overall this is a cut above the vast majority of similar books.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I love the movie, but it feels lacking in substance for its trilogy conclusion. The second movie, &#34;The Dark Knight,&#34; is so good that it is almost unfair to compare this one with the first sequel. It is a cool wrap-up of the Bruce Wayne's story and still manages to be entertaining. There are so many allegories and powerful scenes, but it feels like that the last part of the trilogy has also lost its vitality in finishing the story.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is perfect for me!!  This is my favorite notebook app.  I am an author so this great for writitng books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much that when I play I will get so happy when I play I don't even pay attention to my favorite Tv show when it's on
B002SS8S7E|2.0|The streaming was so poor I eventually gave up and searched for the movie on my Verizon FIOS where I watched the last 30 minutes on TNT (with commercials) where it was also playing.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|it's great!  i've really enjoyed watching this show.  too bad they are on their final season.  wish they could keep on going.
B00881PPTO|5.0|I was looking for the cheapest tickets for a recent flight.  I put in the destination, date, etc.  Then I could easily check the latest prices each day!  Very easy!
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I bought an Anker battery a few years ago and it was great so I got this one for a friend.  One thing to like is the clearly labels 1amp and 2amp ports so its easy to let non tech savvy people know 1 is for phones while the other is for tablets.
B00A4AHZZO|5.0|I discovered this celebrated, yet still, I think, grossly under appreciated conductor when I purchased the stunning EMI Beethoven set with Barenboim on the piano concertos. I have since acquired close to 100 of his recordings and am still hungry for more.<br /><br />Why...?<br /><br />Because Klemperer brings the most consistently MUSICAL vision to his work of any conductor I've ever heard. There are many others I love to hear - Bernstein, Kubelik, MTT and Walter for starters, but with Klemperer, it feels as if the soul of the composer is revealed through unflinchingly precise, disciplined and rocksteady interpretations that unfailingly expose the genius of the architecture supporting the music. I always find myself hearing each composition as if it has been placed under a fine lens and sharpened to vibrant clarity, if I may use a metaphor borrowed from another of our senses.<br /><br />With Mozart, the polite, parlor elegance of, say, Pinnock's more period-authentic perspective, which, incidentally, I find lovely listening as well, is replaced by a strong, darker sound, giving us a glimpse into the depth of the composer's turbulent psyche, often obscured by the sweet \\"social skills\\" of his melodious, seemingly effortless writing. While I've heard many of these pieces done by Klemps before, the kicker for me is the Andante and Fugue, which was new to me. Its mesmerizing, dead-serious Bach-inspired score is brilliantly animated in a performance that surely ranks with the all-time highest achievements in the recordings of Mozart. I found myself hitting \\"repeat\\" immediately after having been flattened by this stunning recording.<br /><br />And lest you feel some hesitation based on the expectation that the Mozart you'll find herein will have been stripped of the charming, gentle sensitivity and delicate textures associated with his work, be assured that Klemps gives you all that as well. Particularly evident in the Andante movements, this music comes across with all ofthat cherished side of the composer completely alive.<br /><br />The question, for me, isn't how Mozart should be played - period, chamber-sized ensembles vs full-powered, old school orchestras. It's more about what this timeless music can be, all the different and valid forms it can take, while still retaining its ageless character. Otto Klemperer reveals a gravitas, an emotional profundity and complexity in Mozart that surely earns him a place among the premier interpreters of his genius. VERY highly recommended!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it so fun and addicting but I hats it when it gets<br />fast get it hows noww noww nowww nowww
1408810263|4.0|I never knew the Germans had occupied any part of England before.  This has all the elements I look for in a good book.  Good writing, historical information, a bit of romance, conflict, and a proper ending that does not leave you hanging and wondering what happened.  I gave this to my Aunt for Xmas after I read it and she loved it too. Her husband was a WW2 vet.
0061564893|4.0|a must for anyone interested in a more expanded view of the ancient world &#34;1434&#34; is to be read too...
B009A9EPLM|5.0|What can be said about John Williams music that hasn't already been said.  It reflects the moods of the movie perfectly and at the same time allows the listener to feel a part of it.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|Anyone who likes cute graphics and has known the tom n jerry style cartoons will like this game. Object is get to the cheese with variations on what you can do according to level, does require a bit of thought for 3 star perfection.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Tons of replayability. Liked the fact that there isn't too much clicking and scrolling around.  Games are short and very strategic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|between the kids and I we play it all the time...love it great graphics n cheesy fun..playing it now... it's on both kindled and the iPhone's...
0786838655|5.0|I bought the set for my daughter after she desperately asked for them following the first Percy Jackson film (which I have not seen). She was sure they'd be great - but after about 25 pages, she decided she didn't want them anymore, and started reading Hunger Games.<br /><br />So I picked up the first book to see if I should keep them around for her younger brother in a couple of years, and was pleasantly surprised by a book for kids that was smart, contemporary, easy to read, but still complex enough to challenge on occasion.<br /><br />It's not as all-encompassing a work as, say, Lord of the Rings, but it would be right at home next to the Narnia books I read 35 years ago, albeit without the Christian slant. I haven't read the Harry Potter series, so I can't say how it holds up against those.<br /><br />As a dad of six, though, I found the book to be a lot of fun, and something I hope my younger kids enjoy in a year or two. Exciting, mystical, fast-paced, and, as an underlying theme, self-empowering for today's kids that often find themselves on the wrong end of the world's cool scale.
B003008RWA|1.0|It was the most one-sided piece of propaganda I have ever seen. There is no way I would call it a &#34;documentary&#34;. It truly sucked!
B0091REZMW|5.0|The tutorial in the beginning was slow but this was a fun game! The graphics are very realistic and dierctions are easy to follow.
B0020M99LC|4.0|Daniel craig has a few movies and i tend to like them, in this bond he does a good job although sean connery fans may disagree but daniel has done great in action roles.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Installation and syncing was smooth as glass. On my phone at least (HTC One) the reading is easy on the eyes and navigation is fairly similar to Kindle's. You can't store books in categories, however; everything comes up as archived, and the only sort available there is alpha by title or author. But since most people will only use it as if it were a paperback stuck into a purse, this should not matter in the least: Once you've loaded it from your archive to the device, whatever you're currently reading comes up on the page where you left off, easy peasy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's pretty fun to play when you have nothing else to do. Lifelike and a good start if your planning on getting g a real horse.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Well done TV series.  Fun and entertaining.  Perhaps my only criticism is that they tend to include tiresome attempts at political commentary guised as a character's view.
B0076794IO|3.0|Started off as a brilliant book and had me interested throughout most of the book. The final pages let the book down as, like other reviewers have stated, the ending seemed rushed.  Worth a read though
B0031QNDUO|5.0|This version is the original black and white one. It brings back the good ole days when life was less complicated.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Very funny movie.  Enjoyed it very much.  I like references to Flash Gordon, I loved that movie.  I would recommend this movie.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|works great! very basic but it does its job well. great for a free app.I definitely recommend this to anyone!
B004J88SGC|5.0|This has to be as good as being there live.  Great camera shots, terrific sound quality, and what a fabulous show.
B00AHQNHSY|2.0|Could not load the Mobo player to my Kindle fire HD. Tried several times but could not make it work. Maybe its my fault. My wife says it usually is.
B004HD61KE|1.0|So unbelievable It could not keep me interested. I'd put it down and then go back to it just to get it over with.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I am not a fan of romance fiction. I do, however, love it when a little romance is blended with mystery. Especially a story with witches, demons,  ghosts, all wrapped up in an interesting story with characters I like. Awesome book. The worst part is having to wait to read the next two in the trilogy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have just started using it to help design a new house ....seems to be the way to go instead of tearing out pages in magazines!!! will probably use it more and more as I explore the possibilities.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun and easy ! Time flies by while playing. All the members of our family enjoy it-<br />We would get it again. Is awesome that we got it for free.
B007V4530A|5.0|If you want to give inspiring talks - and who doesn't - TED talks are a fantastic place to seek inspiration. This book boils down the approaches and techniques that make TED special. What's more, these patterns apply to much more than just TED. Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game ever and I finally play it on my kindle that I take every  I go
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Loads of fun,  freedom to design the restaurant you always wanted. You can invite friends to become your neighbor and give tips and gifts.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Excellent as usual from Mr. Martin. This is one of the few kindle books I have paid full price for (14.99) and every penny was worth it! This book continues the stories of the characters we all love or love to hate. Great book.
B009T3AE1Y|3.0|This was a strange book and the movie is equally strange, but I love all thing Robert Pattinson.  I enjoy his work but this wasn't something I'd sit down and watch over and over like some of his other stuff.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I am looking forward to a time when I can have total immersion and watch them  all.  I haven't been able to watch this show since changing cable complanies.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|This isn't your typical story of Robin Hood and how it usually happens.  It has a neat twist though and is very interesting.  I really enjoyed watching it
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Love this show! It's so different than most \\"detective\\" type shows. Lots of twists and turns. You're never really sure what will happen next. The only downside is that dexter is surrounded by some really awful characters. Hopefully the writers are listening to their fans an start updating these characters somewhat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! You have to run away from the security guard after you were spray painting a train. There are many power ups like  a magnet, a jet pack, super bouncy shoes and more! You can get a mystery box which gives you tokens to get other characters. You can also get money and trophies from it. This game changes frequently. Last month the subway surfer was in NYC while this month is in Rio. Fro a month there are special characters you can get and new hover boards. Hover boards are like skate boards hovering Adobe the ground. If you will not die if you have it on.<br />  As I said, this game is AMAZING, fun, great graphics, and is almost like temple run. Except you must swipe you finger instead of tilting it.<br /> Pls take my advice and get this game. (It is free)
B005COO1X6|4.0|Classic king story that turns the everyday and mundane, in this case an old dirty station wagon, into something creepy and scary. I wish there was more explanation behind the car, but that's just me.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I bought this album after seeing the Searching for Sugar Man movie.  I loved the movie, I love the man Rodriguez, and I love this album.  I bought the other one too (Coming from Reality).  This album is the better of the two, but Coming from Reality is also highly recommended.
B000L53D4O|3.0|My son is 10 months old and has been using it for about two months now.  He enjoys using all of the features on it and it is very durable.  He can beat on it and toss it around without anything breaking off so far.  I didn't give it full marks because using it as a walker is very challenging for him. There is not enough resistance built in that it slides out from underneath him.  We have to hold it when he is trying to walk behind it so it doesn't slide forward too quickly.  I think it will be a good walker when he is already walking, but as a learning toy I would recommend one that has wheels with more grip.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|wanted to read it before the movie and i loved it! can't wait for the movie now! easy and relaxing read
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A good  gripping novel that has a wonderful ending.....very well written.<br />I enjoyed this book and read it in a weekend.  Could not put it down.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I thought it was well written and very absorbing. This led me to read two other Connelly/Bosch npvels. I would definately recommend it.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It follows the book very well and really doesn't deviate from it all. It was exactly what I was expecting and I highly recommend watching this. Very happy I bought it.
1451695195|4.0|It is interesting to read how one who doubted has now become a believer. One cannot ignore the author's credentials and how he conducted his life before his death-like experience. He went from being a skeptic to a true believer who acknowledges that science alone cannot explan what he experienced.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I am having so much fun with my new Kindle Fire, Playing games, listening to my music and staying in touch with email and my calendar.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|love that i can play music to wake up to. Seems to crash often when i start it up. hopefully an update will fix that.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Rankin continues to produce great stories.  Can't wait for another Rebus story.  Suitable for serious adult readers who appreciate a good writing style.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Suspenseful.  You get wrapped up in the story of an innocent man in prison.  It is hard to put it down as you want to know what the next event will bring!
B002T921DE|3.0|America bashing neither necessary, nor relevent and if wasn't for the good ol' US, his career probably wouldn't have culminated to this concert. Would have liked to have seen his band be more a part of the performance, they sound great, but visually kept in the very background. If you are a huge George Michael fan, you may be able to look past his political antics. To me, it took alot of the joy out of the show.
0517543052|4.0|When I read Be Here Now in the early 1970s, a whole new spiritual world opened up for me. Baba Ram Dass's book introduced me to the \\"perennial philosophy\\" and fueled my eclectic search for spiritual Truth. His extensive three-tiered Spiritual Reading List (\\"Books to Hang Out With,\\" \\"Books to Meet with Now and Then,\\" and \\"Books It's Useful to Have Met\\") guided my spiritual reading for a decade. I made it a point to read every book in the \\"Books to Hang Out With\\" category. And thanks to this List, I was turned on to great spiritual classics such as Teachings of Tibetan Yoga, The Zen Teaching of Huang Po, and most importantly, the teachings of the great Ramana Maharshi.<br /><br />In addition to Ram Dass's Spiritual Reading List (which inspired me to create my own Spiritual Reading List, which I include in all the mystical literature I write), Be Here Now is a wonderful read for anyone new to Eastern philosophy and mysticism. The first part of the book is an engaging personal account of Ram Dass's transformation from Richard Alpert, a neurotic, LSD-dropping, and pushing, Harvard psychology professor into a Hindu bhakti yogi and devotee of the great guru Neem Karoli Baba, whom he finds in India. The second section of the book consists of cool, general Dharma wisdom that newbies to Eastern philosophy will find enlightening; and the third part of the book is practical advice and instruction pertaining to spiritual life and practice.<br /><br />I would love to be able to give this wonderful text five stars, but I can't for the following two reasons: 1) In 2008, New Age guru Wayne Dyer, on Public Television, was  seeking donations for the needy Ram Dass, so he could retire in Maui. The implication is clear: If you live exclusively in the now and don't concern yourself with the future, you could, like Ram Dass, end up dependent on financial aid from others. 2)  Ram Dass's book is entitled Be Here Now, but it does not tell you how to directly and immediately BE in the here and now. Decades after he wrote this book, Ram Dass was still practicing japa (mantra) yoga with mala beads rather than simply BEING in the here and now.<br /><br />It took me many years to figure out what \\"Being here now\\" really means and how one could directly and immediately practice it. And that is what I write about in my spiritual literature. Ram Dass's book turned a generation on to the concept of \\"Being here now,\\" but unfortunately, it didn't provide them with the definitive Method, or Way, to directly, immediately, and unqualifiedly BE, here, now, and forever.d now.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Part of the problem was that the book has generated so much hype.  It was like reading a cheap paperback.  Jackie Collins' books were written much better.
0307744434|5.0|I wasn't sure quite what I was expecting when I started this book and when I saw it started with second person present tense, I got a little worried as that would have to be my least favourite tense to read books in as it is very rarely done well.  However after the short prologue, it changed to third person present tense so I breathed a sigh of relief and read on.<br /><br />I am so glad that I did.  I found this novel as magical, mysterious and captivating as the circus the story is about.  With a 9 month old daughter and New Years celebrations, I was unable to read this book in one sitting (it took me maybe 3-4 days?) but every time i put it down, I felt myself almost counting down till I could get back to it.<br /><br />As I said, it wasn't what I expected.  The story kind of creeps up on you and casts a spell or illusion much like the main characters, Marco and Celia might create.  While still grumbling about the second person present tense, I was unaware of the illusion being formed around me and entrancing me until I was at the end and felt like I had been released from a dream.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern's writing was gorgeous and clever and the way she put the story together was genius. Even the second person present tense had its place.  Weaved in bits and pieces throughout the book, it helped tie it all together and form a link with the reader.<br /><br />I am so glad I didn't put it down when I read those first few pages as I would have missed out on an incredibly magical experience.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I do love it. I like that you can choose  from the music playlist and<br />I like the way that the alarm gets progressively louder and louder.<br />That way it does not startle me. It is GREAT!!!!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Excellent gift for the person who has it all. Reasonably priced. arrived fast. Would recommend to a friend. Enjoy. Happy watching.
