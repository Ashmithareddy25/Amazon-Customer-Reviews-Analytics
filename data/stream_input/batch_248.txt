0316666343|3.0|After reading the reviews accompanying the book's release, I was very excited, expecting to find \\"These Lovely Bones\\" not only entertaining, but a good literary novel. While certain aspects were well done -- Sebold is both a reasonably good writer and writes creatively and compellingly about Susie's experiences in heaven -- the book succeeds only for the first half.<br />After setting up the characters and their relationships, Sebold apparently doesn't know what to do with them. While the point of the book is the characters' growth in the wake of the tragedy that begins the book, the story peaks and then falters, unable to progress past the arc toward an effective resolution of both themes and plot. The ending is appalling. Even apart from the horrific \\"Ghost\\"-like chapter near the end, the book's \\"happily ever after\\" ending feels false, especially when compared to the refreshing lack of formula employed in the set-up. If only the creativity and authenticity of the first half could have been sustained, what a novel it would have been. I remain hopeful that Sebold may have such a novel in her. Maybe next time.
B000062TU1|4.0|... As are all movies that are based on a book. There are no exceptions to that. You *cannot* take a movie, and make it exactly like the book. You can try, but probably will not succeed. The book creates its own little world, which is unique to only itself. You can take a movie and make it close to the book, but it will never be exactly the same. That's what I needed to get out of the way. Now, onto business.<br />I am as much of a Harry Potter fan as anybody, perhaps even more. I have read the books dozens of times each, and am anxiously awaiting the 5th one, as is the rest of the world. I believe J.K. Rowling to be one of the greatest authors that ever lived, as do the tens of millions of people that have read her books. <br />I was thrilled when I learned that my favorite series of all time was going to be up on the big screen. Absolutely thrilled. But at the same time I was a bit paranoid. I knew that you cannot make the movie exactly like the book, even with great casting and wicked special effects. I also knew that since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a mildly long book, that the director would have to cut quite a few things out.<br />And I was right. They did. You have to understand that thousands of kids love the books, and if the movie would have included everything that was in the books, the kids would not have been able to sit that long. What the movie did do, though, was take all of the important scenes that were in the book. Yes, I was ticked off when I heard that Peeves wouldn't be in the movie because of time reasons, and of course the missing potions scene was a bit disappointing. But they got all of the good aspects of the book in the movie, which is more important then a mischievous poltergeist and a silly logic sequence. <br />I thought the acting was wonderful, and that the special effects were great *as expected*. Turning a movie into a book is extremely hard work, especially if the movie you're trying to make was one of the most successful book series in all time. I think that they did a splendid job, and I cannot wait for the second one to come out.
B000066I6N|5.0|I always get a sense of disappointment when I see that one of my favorite musicians is doing a covers cd. I always think why can't they put out a cd of all new material? In the case of \\"Dreamland\\", I was not disappointed. In fact, Robert Plant chose songs that I had never heard before (and I've heard millions of songs as a collector and listener). I have many cover cds, but \\"Dreamland\\" must be one of the best. Great song selection, great performances from Plant, and great musicianship from his band. I particularly liked \\"Funny In My Mind (I Believe I'm Fixin' To Die)\\", \\"Last Time I Saw Her\\", \\"Darkness, Darkness\\", \\"Hey Joe\\", and Tim Buckley's \\"Song To The Siren\\" which has to be the best song on this disc. Plant sounds as if he really feels these songs and it shows in his renditions. Not all the songs are cover songs. In looking at the writing credits there are three of the ten which appear to be written by Plant and his band. Overall, Plant does an exceptional job this time out. I consider this his first proper solo cd since 1993's excellent \\"Fate Of Nations\\". Can it be that Robert Plant has more to offer as he continues on past the age of 50? It seems so in listening to Dreamland. That's no small feat, as most musicians over 50 have become boring (Paul McCartney) or out of touch (Ozzy Osbourne). Plant fans will enjoy \\"Dreamland\\" and I recommend anyone to pick this cd up.
B000001FS3|5.0|If you're new to U2, then I think this is definitely the place to start. Their most recent album, 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' may sound a little tired and bland, but 'The Joshua Tree' (along with 'Achtung Baby') shows the band at their creative and commercial peak; from timeless classics like 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' and 'With Or Without You' to the often overlooked - but equally lovely - 'In God's Country', here the Irish quartet were composing anthemic songs that have an epic, cinematic scope while still remaining intimate and affecting. Accusations of bombast and pomposity are irrelevent - this is a modern classic. (If you like this then I'd also recommend the debut album from new British rock band The Urbane - Neon - which is just as powerful but more varied and less pretentious.)
B000069CWE|5.0|To be honest, I never had a chance to listen to all of \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" I'd heard the majority of the tracks on the radio and other sources and thought that besides just having good beats, the lyrics really had something extra in them. You heard the songs once and they stuck.<br />Now, the entire album of \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and then some is 'reanimated' and brought back to life with more creativity and inventiveness than ever.<br />I myself am a casual listener to music. However, Hip-Hop is a genre that never particularly interested me. In \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" Linkin Park did a good job infusing elements of both Rock and Hip-Hop. With \\"Reanimation,\\" they lean more towards techno-ish beats and Hip-Hop but amazingly, they pulled it off and I throughly enjoyed the whole album.<br />Not all credit belongs to Linkin Park, however, as many of their collaborators breathe new life to the songs. From Jonathan Davis from Korn and Aaron Lewis from Staind, the new vocals refresh the songs. To add to that, the guest DJs picked the choicest beats and sounds. You could pretty much say that all the tracks of past have been reinvented completely.<br />As for personal favorite tracks, PTS.OF.ATHRTY (Points of Authority remix) by Jay Gordon ties in with ENTH E ND (In The End remix) by Kutmasta Kurt with Motion Man as excellent tracks. However, MY&lt;DSMBR (My December remix) by Mickey P. featuring Kelli Ali is the highlight of the album for me simply cause of the way it breaks away from all the anger and high decibels of the previous songs to reveal a mellow, melancholy song and beat.<br />Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of \\"Reanimation\\" today. You won't be disappointed when you blast it in your car on a hot day on the road or anywhere for that matter.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I of course knew that with every great film, there comes a soundtrack. I was a little apprehensive when I heard that there was going to be one for Harry Potter. I wondered how on earth anybody could take the magic of Harry Potter and turn it into music.<br />All doubts vanished from my mind when I saw the Harry Potter Theatrical Trailer. The music was extraordinary. I couldn't believe it. I anxiously awaited the arrival of the soundtrack, a few weeks before the movie was due to hit theaters. Upon hearing the first note, I was completely hooked.<br />My favorite song on the track has to be Hedwig's Theme. It took just a little snippet from all the other songs, and combined them all into one glorious finale. <br />John Williams is one of the best composers that ever walked on the face of the earth. He is indeed, truly &quot;magical.&quot;
B000006OBQ|5.0|I use to always wonder what was the big deal about this guy Sinatra. Having grown up on Motown, Funkedelics, Heavy Metal, Jazz Fusion and Rap. I could never understand the allure and appeal that Sinatra commanded.  I was exposed to Sinatra the actor. But never the singer. Now I completely understand why Sinatra was and is considered as probably the greatest entertainer in American history. This album has totally persuaded me that there is and was NO EQUAL!!<br />Just to think that he was 50 years old when he made this. It is absolutely incredible the way he sings on the beat (as in Fly Me To The Moon) then off the beat in (September of My Years). Not to mention how LONG he holds notes. (I can't even think of one male singer today who can hold notes like that). Just listening to this album makes me wish I could be in Vegas during those times to experience it. <br />Along with &quot;the Count&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;, this is definitely in my opinion the very best Sinatra album.<br />I recently read where the rapper/producer Sean &quot;Puff Diddy&quot; Combs said that he hoped one day to be like Sinatra. After two grammys he only has 60 movies, 1000's of records, 3 Oscars, a Peabody, Emmys, Golden Globe, Congressional Gold Medal, NAACP Lifetime Achievement Award, Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. To top it all off the guy also had a social conscious !! nuff said!<br />Elvis (the King) is dead long live Sinatra!! BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU DON'T BUY ANY OTHER SINATRA ALBUM!!
B000000WA2|5.0|Musically, the songs on this album are excellent.   However, the album achieves its brilliance in the lyrics.   In short, this album is a lyrical masterpiece.  To truly appreciate the songs on the CD, one must look into the content of the lyrics.   The theme of this CD can be summed up by the title of their earlier album, \\"Modern life is rubbish\\".   Blur's genius lies in their critical takes on the alienation of modern day life.  The album is deep in its meaning and it will probably made a lot of people to 'break into a cold sweat' once they realized what this album is all about.<br />Don't buy this CD if all u like is lyrically meaningless songs.  U are probably the very same people that Blur is singing about in this album.
B000067CPX|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers really turned heads with their 1999 release, Californication. With 2002's, &#34;By The Way&#34; they will undoubtedly cause yet another stir. The album explores a diverse array of musical styles and territory, from funk to punk, R & B to alternative grooves, jazz horns to ska forms, and simple straight up rock n roll, Red Hot Chili Peppers style. What we get is a consistently changing landscape of 16 inspired Chili Peppers songs.  4.5 stars of 5
B00003CY6M|4.0|This is a predictable romanctic comedy starring John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale.  The story opens with the two shopping in Bloomindales for a christmas gift for a loved one.  Love at first site meets destiny, as they fall in love with each other. Then the female lead says she'll leave their relationship up to fate by writing her name and phone number inside a hardcover book then selling it to a used book store.  Years pass, they search for each other, and go on with their lives and their original relationships, and continue to search for each other. I don't want to give any more of this predictable story away.  It's a sweet love story, very well acted. Rent this one first, then if you fall in love with it invest in it.
0375804153|5.0|This is an interactive book....the kids hearing it read to them will help you decide whether to listen to Grover and stop turning the pages, or go on with Elmo...it's just what the pre-schooler loves, and I enjoy it as well!!!  The first one was only with Grover, and I gotta admit, even better.  Buy both!
B000069HKH|5.0|I've been a Springsteen fan for 25 years but haven't been thrilled with any of his albums since &quot;Born to Run&quot;. It's always been about his live shows. But this cd changes that...it's brilliant. I'm only on my 4th listen, but this is, in my opinion,  the best studio release he's ever done. Sure, it's a tribute to 9/11 victims, but it's inspiring - not depressing. ALL the songs are great, and if you read along with the lyrics you'll probably shed a tear or two, but overall it's exciting and uplifting. Bruce's best...and the best cd of the year so far.

B00005JKLZ|5.0|I have seen this film get a bad knock or two for literary license. Let us remember that this film was directed by Simon Wells. The original book was written by H.G. Wells. The Director is the great grandson of the famous author. Therefore, can his vision of the Time Machine be any less creative than the original vision of his great grandfather? Both men created a Science Fiction classic presented through their talent and creative presentation of this concept of travel through time. Both ought to be measured on their own merit individually, and both are quite excellent.<br />Comparisons to the original movie, directed by George Pal and starring Rod Taylor, often discount the simple fact that film artists of the time were constrained by the technology available. It was the vision of a gifted director, and certainly a classic and wonderful adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel. Nevertheless, being different and unique, the new version is beautiful and brilliant.<br />Guy Pearce does a fine job in the lead role of distracted scientist, driven by creative passion to create a machine with which to travel into the past to save his fiance. Finding he could not change the past, seeks to find answers in the future that will enable him to ultimately save her.<br />The special effects sequences are astounding and altogether marvelous. The time machine itself is a construct of pure genius. It is beautiful, brilliant, and astounding in design. The effects seen as centuries pass and the world changes around the time traveller are some of the best special effects ever produced.<br />The purpose of movies is to entertain, and this one delivers in abundance. It is not a remake of George Pal's vision, nor does it conform entirely to the H.G. Wells novel. It is a unique vision of Simon Wells, and viewed on its own merit, is absolutely excellent. The purpose of Science Fiction is to inspire a certain degree of awe and sense of wonder in boldly charging into the unknown. This film does this as deftly as any made in recent years.<br />My only reservation is that English would still be a living language 800,000 years from now. That struck me as highly unlikely. So too the lack of weathering on stones with carved lettering from centuries past. Aside from that small gripe, I found the film to be amazing and wonderful. I was entirely entertained.<br />I give this film 5 stars, and expect to watch it repeatedly over the years and enjoy it many times. It is one of the few made in recent times that one wishes to see again and again. In fact, after seeing it in the theatre twice, I have seen it on DVD 3 times already! Not bad in a collection of over 450 DVD movies!this as deftly as any made in recent years. <br />My only reservation is that English would still be a living language 800,000 years from now.

B000069HKH|5.0|The massive hype around this cd made me a little nervous, but after listinging to the entire CD I can see why Sony is pushing it so hard.  This is an absolute triumph is every sense of the word.  This cd has it all.  Classic Bruce anthems (The Rising, Into the Fire, Lonesome Day), incredibly moving ballads (Paradise, You're Missing, The Nothing man, Empty Sky), total rockers like Bruce and the E-Street band has never done (Countin on a Miracle, Further On Up the Road ([rocks]), Old School Rave-ups (Mary's Place) and poppy soul (Let's Be Friends, Waiting on a Sunny Day).  And to wrap it all up, a beautiful, powerful gospel song of hope (City of Ruins).  <BR>They also try some new things on this cd, such as the worldly tune \\"World's Apart,\\" and the U2 influenced \\"The Fuse.\\"  <BR>Almost all of it works (Let's be Friends is way to poppy for me, but some of the \\"Born in the USA\\" era fans may like it).  <BR>All in all, this is right up there with Bruce's best work.  It takes elements from all of his best music, and makes it modern and relevant in today's music scene (Producer Brendan O'Brien influence).  <BR>Enjoy.
B00000IREA|5.0|Immensely entertaining camp classic from director Roger Vadim.<BR>Jane Fonda is utterly charming as the title character playing her with an innocence and optimism that is completely beguiling.<BR>The opening credit sequence with the wonderful theme song is worth the price of entry alone.Great sets and lovely Panavision photography make this required viewing at least once a month.
B000069CWE|5.0|This CD is great. Everything you heard on Hybrid Theory gets changed to a techno feel. they also add more rap to it, and even though i really dont like rap, its cool, cuz Linkin Park does rap good! Definetly buy this album. Cyaz!
6301607929|4.0|A drifter named Hal finds himself invited to an annual picnic in a small Kansas town; trouble and romance follow...Although I'll have to admit that this film has certain flaws: the slight miscasting of the too-old leads, the direction which dates quite badly and the rather bad performance of Rosalind Russell as the desperate spinster schoolmarm - it still has the ability to hold one's interest throughout. Kim Novak hasn't much range as the beautiful, shy Madge, and as Millie, the plain, intellectual little sister, Susan Stasberg is adequate. Although Holden gives his best shot as Hal, it seems his then 37 years were against him; a commendable try otherwise. As Rosemary, the spinster schoolteacher, Russell overacts horrendously, but has a fine scene - where she's less affected and more realistic -talking to O'Connell on the wooden steps of the boardinghouse. Likeable Cliff Robertson is rather neutral in his journeyman role as Alan (his father is played by Milburn Drysdale (Raymond Bailey) without his hairpiece!) As Mrs. Potts, the sweet old lady neighbour who likes Holden and took him in, Verna Felton gave a beautifully memorable performance and Betty Field does well as Flo (although I felt Flo too easily gave up fighting against Madge's determination to be with Hal; it seemed against her character) The film is very fifties and the ambience of it all is like a nostalgic look back at a much simpler time (the town in which they shot the film was in actuality Hutchinson, Kansas)
B00002MZ4W|5.0|when the pawn should come with a warning label: may intensify depression.  this album explores what's inherently dark about life, in a way that's surprising, artful, and appealing.  yet, this is not 'inspirational' and fiona isn't the kind of artist to donate a million dollars to charity.  she's a sad, dark tortured artist - albeit with a creative genius and the fame to get her music to the masses.  just how depressing is when the pawn?  it gets to the dread that exists in all of us at our worst.  she talks about everything that is hurtful in life- especially in the game of romantic relationships.  &quot;hunger hurts but starvin' works, when it costs too much to love&quot; she croons on paper bag.  &quot;it won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your hand&quot; she furiously renders on &quot;limp.&quot;  combine dark subject matter with even darker, jazz-pop music and what you have here is a prime slice of misery music- great for a rainy day when you can't get out of bed.  not typically house party music.  but if you like music that gets to the bottom of the maladies of existence, buy this album and i doubt you'll be disappointed.
B00005R1N3|4.0|Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder (fresh from DePalma's \\"Sisters\\") give two stunning performances.  Keep in mind this film provided the blueprint for nearly every slasher film to follow (it was made in 1974).  Creepy phone calls, a psycho lurking nearby, holiday-themed horror, it would all be ripped off later and many, many times over.  Bob Clark's direction is sure-footed, giving us point-of-view shots from the killer's perspective!  This too, would soon be copied in countless late 1970's and early 1980's slasher films.  A true original and a must-see!

The person I thought was the best is Hermine Granger(Emma Waston.) Because, she was the smartest and cutest. If any of the actors of this movie or dractors that are reading this PLEASE try to give me a part in the seconed movie or any of the movies
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is their most famous album. Its success is owing to make it so commercial, I mean, all the songs are very enjoyable to all the people who like rock in general. On the other hand, we have Thom Yorke's voice doing his best, good use of the guitars and the drums as well, with soft songs that carry you away, like for example, Karma police or No surprises. There is none I dislike, and it's worth listening while you're lying on the bed.
0385503954|3.0|To an extent, I see what all the fuss is about. McEwan has a wonderful descriptive talent at his disposal and creates a gallery of memorable characters in the only way such characters can come to life: through skillful showing and not telling. But he certainly sends those characters up in one rickety craft. The result? His lofty creation comes crashing to earth in flames. As other reviewers have pointed out, Robbie's conviction is an unbelievable sham, something that couldn't possibly happen in the real world, but I was still willing to suspend disbelief because I was interested in and cared about the characters.<br />I also found Robbie's long march...<br />Adding to the absurdity is Briony's gestural self-sacrifice, told through the labored pentimento of the last section of the book, a literary lead balloon if there ever was one. So while I respect McEwan's evident talent and was with him through much of the narrative, ultimately I was greatly let down by it.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Excellent Sci-fi film.  The premise of this movie is that Sigourney Weaver must go back to the original planet where her deceased crew made first contact with the Alien, this time with a troop full of marines.  This is a great movie that has classic Cameron action sequences and special effects, but also a frantic and claustrophobic atmosphere.  All of the acting is well done, namely Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser, Bill Paxton, and the little kid.  The Alien Queen at the end still looks AWESOME.  Quick warning, though, this is the SPECIAL EDITION, and that means you CAN ONLY CHOOSE THE DIRECTOR'S CUT, not the theatrical version.  This may make a difference because about 17 minutes of footage are added, mostly for good reason, but occasionally it is unnecessary and/or slightly damaging to the suspense.  My advice to you is RENT THE DVD first, just to make sure you like the new version and extra footage, and buy it later.  In case you were wondering, most of the restored footage has to do with the colonists early on and some pretty cool sentry machine guns about 2/3 through.  In my opinion, either version is great, too bad they didn't include both!
B00003CXXS|1.0|The story begins when an adventurous married couple manage to persuade Grant (Sam Neil, who had already appeared in the first part), a palaeontologist that still continues his studies about prehistoric animals, in order to be him the one who will lead them in Sorna island, which is the last refuge for some revived dinosaurs by a scientist years ago. They actually want to find their lost child, but the plane crashes, so they are in danger, because the dinosaurs are everywhere, and this time, they are intelligent and have the capacity to communicate with each other. The group splits up in a moment, in which the boy finally appears, but they run up against the awful dinosaurs and they will have many problems from now to then.<BR>This is the third part of the saga started by Steven Spielberg, and is undoubtedly the worst. When I saw it, I didn't get scared in any moment; because of the regrettable performance the actors did, above all, Ta Leoni's. They never seemed to be really shocked with the entire situation. Besides, all was so predictable and boring: the very forced crashing of the plane, the hunt, and the way they escape at the end. The special effects were nothing extraordinary, and the script looks to be written in a couple of minutes. In addition, its short length proves their effort at making this pitiful movie that is completely lacking of any good ideas. I don't understand why was so successful.
B000005RMY|5.0|The Sisters of Mercy in their short life (they only put out 3 proper albums in their existence) had tremendous influence on the Goth genre.  This album spans their early, and nearly impossible to find, singles.  There are some real gems here, namely Alice, Valentine, Lights, and Temple of Love.  The cover of Gimme Shelter is heavy-handed but great fun nonetheless.  If you liked Vision Thing and Floodland, be aware that this does not have the same production quality of those later efforts.  However, the Sister's power and energy are still there, and Andrew's vocals are steadfast, except for on a couple songs like The Damage Done (where he sounds like a deranged Elvis), one of the worst songs on the album (along with Home of the Hit-Men). But the other songs more than make up it.<br />If you like bands like Bauhaus or even early Cranes, you'll find this CD worth your 30 bux.  If you're more into the high production albums (Vision Thing), or heavy guitars, you might want to hear some of the songs before parting with your hard-earned money.
B000069CWE|3.0|Not really sure how to describe this. If think you are expecting like their last LP then your in for a shock. This LP is more Hip Hop then rock and it has a lot of samples. Its one of those LP you either like it or hate it. I'm on the border line considering i'm a huge Linkin Park fan, so it was impressive but at the sametime dissapointing. I guess I expect more from them like their last LP. I'm not giving this a bad review, i'm just saying do not expect anything like their last LP. I find myself bobbing my head to most of it and sometimes i find it sour. A lot of of different beats and samples. The featured guest do pretty good. So again if your are more into the rock version of linkin park then you will probally wont like this. If you like Hip Hop then i guess you could pick it up or just borrow it from somebody. not something to rush to the stores and pick up. I still need to listen to it over and over. Hopefully their new LP that should be comming out later this year would be as good or better than the Hybrid Theory.
B00005ATQD|5.0|A wealthy doctor (Tom Cruise) lives in a luxurious house with his wife (Nicole Kidman) They both are happy, but one night, she confesses him her sexual desires and, from now to then, the story turns into a psychological obsession. That night he contracts a prostitute and after, he meets an old friend from the college, Nick Nightingale, who's now a pianist. Nick tells him about a place where he has to play blindfolded. This attracts the doctor's interest and, in addition, it results that everyone there is costumed. Soon after, he discovers that the highly secret gathering is in fact an erotic orgy. He begins to worry, and he finishes up by being the eyewitness of a murder.<BR> Tom Cruise's portrayal of this doctor is excellent. He's a very careful man who always speaks correctly, but actually, he doesn't trust his own wife because of her words. He finds that even Nick and the prostitute are missing after the incident, and that scares him more, but he tries to find out the truth. On the other hand, Nicole Kidman is outstanding being a sensual woman who seems to be involved in the plot.<BR>Like all Kubrick's creations, this is superb. Here we have a thriller that deals about erotic obsession and jealousy, going by comfortable places. In it, we can see some frightening scenes, like the feeling that someone follows you, and not knowing what's up. I liked very much all the alarming situation, which goes so slowly, and at the end, you don't know what to think.
1573220485|5.0|Welcome to Utopia. Alex Garland's debut is one of the best travel writings I've ever read. His writings literally brings you to the streets of Bangkok and the immaculate beaches of Thailand.  The characters in the book, particularly Richard and Jed (which incidentally, was apparently butchered by the screenwriter and therefore totally absent from the movie), are distinctly memorable. One may also call this book an up-to-date, hip, BazLuhrmanized version of Lord Of The Flies. <br />It's not so much about backpacking, smoking...or a prolonged summer vacation. It's about finding a little bit of Hell in the middle of Eden and how the different groups of people's react to this. It's all about human psychology and different persepectives. It poses the question of what would you do if you were there? This book is a definite page-turner with the pace surprisingly goes from normal to top speed almost halfway through the book (I took 2 and a half days to finish it).<br />However, a word of caution : to enjoy this book, you MUST disassociate everything between this book and the movie at all costs.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This results to be a quite good album, like all Radiohead creates. However, Amnesiac is not as high-level as Kid A. It's quite hard working in all the songs. The ones I liked most are I might be wrong and Life in a glasshouse, in the latter, by the way, are played instruments like the trumpet, the trombone or the clarinet, weird sounds in a rock band, but I think it's very creative. In addition, this album contains such wonders like the rhythmical variations they often do. This album restores the way of OK Computer and Kid A at the same time, but in it rather predominate the electric sound.<BR>What's going to happen next? How will be the style of the next album, like their great hit, OK Computer, or maybe they will continue the way of Kid A and this? I wish Radiohead would amaze us with another marvel!
B0000029LG|3.0|1.  Buy the album.<BR>2.  Throw away disc 2.<BR>3.  Listen to disc 1.<BR>4.  Avoid  &quot;The Girl is Mine.&quot;
B00004XONN|5.0|This following work of Radiohead after the well-known OK Computer album is so different facing their earlier works. In it, they seldom use guitars, just electronic sounds almost all the time, and the result is magnificent. All the songs in the album have a high quality and the same style, except How to disappear completely, which is quite good, but it doesn't seem to belong to this album, because of it softness. I find fantastic all their great sound, which is no easy task, and Thom Yorke's voice. Despite it's not as known as OK Computer, I think this is their best effort. I liked, above all, Everything in its right place, Morning bell and Idioteque. However, I don't understand why there are several minutes in silence after finishing the last song.
B0000640VO|3.0|I love a good romantic/sweet comedy as much as anyone, but rather than feel glad or happy when these two young lovers got together in the end of the film, I felt uninterested and even slightly annoyed!  I wondered why, thought about it, and this is what I came up with:<br />The film is primarily based around Amelie's desire to form a romantic relationship with a young man, correct?  In order for the audience to sympathize and be carried along with her in this aim, a certain amount of erotic or romantic tension, a dramatic arc, needs to accompany her desire for his attention.  Sexuality is an important part of that tension, and if the the story gives too much away early on, that tension is nullified.  By showing Amelie (none-too-subtly) having sex with another man early in the film, the spell was broken.  Furthermore, the \\"sexual-tension bubble\\" was burst several times in other ways, from the \\"symphony of orgasms\\" scene, to her friends' loud sexual encounter in the bathroom, to the fact that her potential boyfriend works in a porno shop, continuously surrounded by rubber phalluses.<br />The result of all this sexual frankness and anti-climax is that Amelie's cuteness no longer serves any sort of sexual or romantic tension...it's just annoying.  The lovers' long-awaited kiss at the end of the film seems timid and dull after what we've been exposed to earlier in the film.  This isn't a moral criticism...it's an artistic one.  A peach doesn't seem as sweet once someone has taken a big bite out of it.
B00000K19E|5.0|Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the real name of Mr. Anderson. On the one hand, he is a clerk who works for an enterprise, living the life of a current man. On the other hand, he results to be a hacker called like that. He meets an odd woman (Carrie-Ann Moss) who carries him away in order to meet Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). They are a hidden group of people also called by unusual names, and Morpheus is the one who tells Neo the truth: the world where he lives isn't the real world, but one called Matrix which is made by machines for humans that don't know they are prisoners. However, they do know this, so their duty is to save human beings from there looking for someone special, chosen to be the one who will finish this war and let people be free. Morpheus believes Neo is that person, who's not sure of himself, but he must try to open his mind and see he's capable of everything now, even jumping over buildings. He will have to expose his life to danger to save Morpheus' and fight with the dreadful agents that will bring them in many problems.<BR> So brilliant. Yes, this is the best action movie I've ever seen with no doubt because a lot of things. First, it doesn't deal about gunshots and explosions most of the time, but about martial attacks, one-to-one fights, assaults in the air and people being able to do more of what a normal human would do. The special effects are excellent, and the script as well, I mean, the idea of that the world where we live is not the real world, and the conflict established between human beings and machines. Another important thing here is the look of the characters, all in black, wearing sunglasses and carrying mobile phones of the new generation. I also liked their conversations. <BR> You should watch it. There's no praise enough for this work, and I'm waiting anxiously for its sequel.
6304401132|4.0|i loved this movie it's one of my favorites but i think they should make a part 2 like when rose marries the prince and they have a child who explores the woods like her mother once did look i'm sorry oh it's ok if you don't agree with me you guys but you should agree with me one day you'll wise up and make a script
6305252521|4.0|A man called Truman (Jim Carrey) lives on an island somewhere. The life inside is quite normal for him. He looks like a current guy who works in an office, but actually, he's the most regarded man in the world. I explain: the whole island is in fact a hidden TV studio, full of cameras placed everywhere in order to follow him, because he is the main part of the programme on television. All people know this, but Truman doesn't, so they act to make the stage a normal city. However, he begins to notice some weird events, for example, the surprise of seeing his dead father like a beggar in the street and a large amount of people who suddenly bring him away. <BR> This movie is so funny because of these incidents, which make you understand the trick and laugh all the time. Nevertheless, when he realizes all this, you see that it isn't funny at all, because he feels he's been living in an illusory world. Nobody loves him in fact, so he decides to escape out of the island in order to find a place with no lies. All is a trap. In this moment you see his frustration because of the incapability of being able to do that inside his comical appearance. This is the first movie in which Jim Carrey stars in with a serious portrayal, despite he's amusing in many moments.<BR> I liked it a lot. It is one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen because of the so entertaining situations in which he gets involved. Also, the comedy turns into a drama at the end. Will he finish living in a world where real people exist and love, without lies nor being the point of attention to everybody? Anyway, even being the man who attracts all people's interest, nobody cares about him when he crosses the door outside the island to an unknown place and they just finish up by ignoring him and choosing another channel.
0140288503|4.0|This story seems to move at the pace of the real events.  It is a good book but you will not feel good after reading it.  The feeling is more like getting to the surface of the pool after being underwater too long.
0345349571|5.0|A Distant Mirror is a delight to read, even for those who aren't terribly familiar with late Medieval France and England.  This book is filled with unforgettable characters, including Barbara Tuchman's protagonist the Sire of Coucy.  This chivalrous French noble rises to the top of the French aristocracy, and his fascinating life adventures take him to all corners of 14th century Europe and cause him to relate closely with most leading figures of the day including Kings, Princes, Popes, Knights, Outlaws, Nobles, and even celebrities like Chaucer.<br />Barbara Tuchman's narrative is always informative and often entertaining and witty.  She offers the reader some unforgettable images of French medieval events and life including the Hundred Years' War, Papal Schism, Black Death, 'Free Companies' Tournaments, Festivals, Ceremonies, and Courtly life and intrigues.<br />Readers will learn about fascinating characters including:  King Edward III of England and his son Edward, the heroic but ruthless Black Prince, the plotting King Charles \\"The Bad\\", incompetent French King Jean \\"The Good\\", English soldiers of fortune, extravagant and psychotic Dukes, corrupt Popes, and scores of other personalities such as Froissart and Chaucer.<br />This is a book to read and treasure---don't miss!!
B000069CWE|4.0|If you like Linkin Park's original CD, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, you'll probably like their remix CD, &quot;Reanimation&quot;.  Linkin Park brought in a slew of DJs and rappers to help them bring out a CD that would hold fans over until their second &quot;true&quot; CD comes out in about six months.  Some remixes turned out really great, standouts include &quot;By Myself&quot;, &quot;Place For My Head&quot;, &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; and, of course, their single, &quot;Points Of Authority&quot;, which came out with some harsh beats and more speed to them.  However, the great dissappointments of the CD were their original singles.  The remix of &quot;In The End&quot; sounds faster at best, nothing much has changed.  Although they did change many of the lyrics of the song, the song sounds too similar to the original, with only real noticeable difference to the song being in the chorus, where the tune becomes more muddled and crowded.  &quot;Crawling&quot; sounds similar as well, the beat is changed very little, sounding more like a rehash than a remix.  A new, rapid fire verse is added, which is a nice addition, but not enough to make me like it as much as the original.  &quot;Papercut&quot; was my biggest disappointment.  Being my favorite song on the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; CD, I was excepted a great remix, if nothing else at least a good one.  However, I was disappointed, as they just put out the exact same song, with the tiny change of making the song sound a little more electronic, not remixed at all.  I could do the exact same thing with the original version of &quot;Papercut&quot;, all I'd have to do it put it on really poor speakers and turn up the static.  &quot;One Step Closer&quot; is the only decent remix of their singles, which is a true remix, but instead of speeding it up, they slowed it down and put a lot more emphasis on the beat, so the vocalists are overshadowed by the beat.  I find this to be one of the average remixes on the CD. With the &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; remix, you'll find more of the same, great DJing, but a variety of new samples have been added to his old ones.  &quot;With You&quot; is also slowed down and lengthed, I would say the same thing about this one as the &quot;One Step Closer&quot; remix.  Along with the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; remixes, you get remixes of a variety of remixes of songs from their first EP.  &quot;High Voltage&quot; was a good song originally, but the has a much stronger beat as well as a featured rapper added to it.  I have not listened to the songs of &quot;My December&quot; or &quot;X-ecutioner's Style&quot; enough to get a good grasp of what I think of them, but what I've heard of them, they aren't really stand-outs of the album, but aren't disappointing either, don't buy the album to hear these song though.  Really, it's a really good album, but don't think of it as a follow-up to &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, it's not that.  What it is, though, is a little treat for those of us who like remixes and something to hold all of Linkin Park's fans until they release their next CD.

0060506989|1.0|Rarely does a movie shine when the book came first.  Here is an exception.  The prologue shows exceptional literary style and promise.  The rest of the book (or as much as I suffered through) is so badly crafted that it is a wonder an editor let it through.  If you are not interested in intricate details of Vietnamese generals, rapidly shifting points of view and uneven verb tenses, give this one a wide berth.
0345446798|5.0|My library of dog books is growing steadily, and this book is the latest addition. It is also the only one that I have read from cover to cover. Unlike other dog training books that I have read, this book does not give you step by step instructions on how to solve certain dog behavioural issues. Instead, Dr. McConnell, in fluid and conversational prose, reveals to readers what years of research and experience have taught her about dog behaviours. She draws parallels between dogs and humans, and also demonstrates, through stories, how humans often mis-read and mis-communicate with our doggie partners. The real-life stories are sometimes funny, sometimes bittersweet, and sometimes downright sad, but they all serve a purpose - to teach us why dogs behave the ways they do, and how us humans can improve and enhance our relationships with our canine friends by having a better and deeper understanding of how they communicate. An excellent read and certainly a critical addition to a dog-lover's library.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is an album that gets better with each listening and will be considered great ten years from now. Springsteen and the E Street band have never sounded better in the studio. Some of the musical terrain harkens back to such great albums as The River and Tunnel of Love, but they also forge ahead with numbers like &quot;Worlds Apart.&quot; The upcoming tour should be a wonderful showcase for the material from The Rising.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|I did like the emotional qualities of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\": the fear involved in an invisible spy conspiracy, the frustration of having a husband consumed by a mental disorder, the heartbreaking of finding out that people you care about aren't real.  In many ways, it's an engrossing story about John Nash and his very patient but hurt wife.  In others, it's a nervous twitch.  I don't know the real John Nash nor do I know much about him.  I do know that movies tend to portray schizophrenics or other mentally disturbed people (if they even take that risk) with an essence of staring of into space, snapping at people for no reason, walking hunched over, keeping to themselves.  Perhaps this is how John Nash is, but watching Russell Crowe act out this madness kind of wears you out. It gets very heartbreaking. And dare I say, it becomes a bit annoying?<BR>I can say that the movie was not as schmaltzy as I thought and the performances were generally good.  Jennifer Connelly (as wife Alicia Nash) deserved that Academy Award.  Alicia Nash herself deserves an award for standing by her husband through his problems if she is truly the strong person that Connelly portrays.<BR>I believe Ron Howard has probably made better movies that were worthy of Oscar wins (i.e. \\"Apollo 13\\"), and I feel like the Academy may have given him his props finally but for the wrong film.  Oscar does have a history of rewarding deserving contenders later on for previous losses.  Russell could tell you about that.  He deserved the award for \\"The Insider,\\" but not for \\"Gladiator.\\"  But that is an entirely different rant altogether.  <BR>I will say that I did LIKE the movie, but I didn't love it enough to want to buy it.  You may see things differently and think it's brilliant.  I just found Crowe's portrayal too intense and the movie centered too much around that intensity.
B000060MY6|5.0|I bought a copy of this film for my collection and watched it for the third time.<br />My second viewing pretty much crystallized everything for me. I had waited a month since my initial viewing and had tossed the movie around in my head, as well as talking about it with others who'd seen it, and of course, surfing the Net to see if other people had the same opinion as to the movie's plot (and there very, very much so IS a plot here. folks).<br />The third viewing is even better because I am pretty much sure of Lynch's intentions now, and I can kick back and just enjoy the sheer audaciousness of so much of this thing. Not to mention the sublime performances of Watts and Harring (and the solid supporting turns by Theroux, Miller and Lynch's hand-picked \\"cameo cast\\"--Chad Everett, Lee Grant, etc.)<br />Lynch wouldn't like this, but I have fast-forwarded to the segment where \\"Diane Selwyn\\" (the film's TRUE protagonist) wakes up, and I have watched those last minutes until the end twice now. I believe this segment of film is virtually flawless. And tremendously sad. One thing that really struck me about \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is that out of all of Lynch's films (save \\"Elephant Man\\") this one really knocks you in the solar plexus emotionally as well as leaving you with an admiration for the craft involved. This is in no small part due to Naomi Watts. History will scratch its head over why she wasn't up for the Oscar. A crucial performance--without it, I don't think the movie would have the power it virtually streamrolls to in the end.<br />Angelo Badalamenti's music also should have been included in the Oscar nominations. A pretty much shameful oversight; it adds immeasurably to the film's tone.<br />Well, that's my second take on what has become one of my all-time favorite movies.
B00005JKHN|5.0|&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is a classic, needless to say.  It's a wonderful romantic fairy tale story brought to the screen with fantastically realistic animation, haunting and melodic Tchaikovsky music, humor, and gorgeous backdrops.  The most extraordinary thing about this animated film is that no computers were used.  Every pose was hand-drawn and painted (remember when animated films were drawn by hand?), and transferred to 70 mm, another first for a Disney film.<BR>This is guaranteed to make a great transition to DVD.  The restored version on VHS is already beautiful and it's not even in widescreen.  Not only can I not wait to see the film in its original format, but I also look forward to also seeing other documentaries about the process of making the movie and why it is still timeless today.  Hopefully they'll produce a disk or two similar to the one they made for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; celebrating the debut of a landmark animated film on DVD.  If only studio execs would get cracking!
0738206679|5.0|The book assumes almost no mathematical background but it manages to detail a lot of his research processes.

B000002L68|5.0|Even several weeks before its release, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was destined to be a smash hit.  Here is the sountrack to the movie that would make Prince an international superstar, giving Michael Jackson some fierce competition on the charts.  &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is the album that introduced the band the Revolution, and they do a formidable job serving an excellent blend of straight-up funk and guitar fueled rock.  When the single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; was released, nothing like it had ever been done before.  Who ever thought of composing a song that completely eliminates a bassline?  The single was simultaneously strange yet engaging, and amounts to a five minute stroke of brilliance.  &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; is his most energetic single to date, a song that no doubt earned him a Grammy for best rock performance.  But it's the lesser known songs that also stand out such as his duet with Appolonia &quot;Take Me With U&quot; and the often-overlooked &quot;Baby I'm a Star,&quot; which he performed at the 1985 Grammys.  Prince never released an album that sold even remotely close to this, but it did make him a household name and a fixture in mainstream pop.  Truth be told, the soundtrack tells a better story than the movie itself, and it's one of the very best records of the last 20 years.
B000069CWE|4.0|This is a good CD, but is mainly rap than Hybrid Theory's rock sound. Pretty good but don't expect to sound anything like Hybrid Theory.
B000069HKH|2.0|If effort relates inversely to age with many aging rockers uncomfortably fiftyish, than Springsteen (and nominally, the E-Street Band) can no longer be considered the exception.<br />'The Rising' seems to be a hurried effort both lyrically and musically, with tracks like 'Into the Fire' simple to the point of enui, and the addition of an ethnic chant-like group named 'Asif Ali Kahn' as guest vocals in 'Worlds Apart'. The overall sound of the album is polished to the point of overproduction, with the effect of putting lipstick on a very bankrollable pig. Nearly every song fails to deliver the storytelling we have come to expect from The Boss (See: Nebraska, Born in the USA), and degenerates into chants of repeated lines and sounds (Li li la la). The presence of the E-Street Band is disappointing to, not in quality but being 'there' at all - very few big sax solos for the big man, and no pictures in the CD book of the Band until the second to last page.<br />In summary, I guess The Boss has bills to pay too.
B000069CWE|4.0|Hybrid Theory was an excellent CD and Reanimation has a lot of cool remixes, but is more of a rap album than a rock.

B00004WEJZ|5.0|The Origins of 007`s arch-nemeis Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and his organization SPECTRE (the Special Executive for Conterintelligence Terrorism Revenge and Extortion) were in a committee (that included James Bond creator Ian Fleming, Jack Whittingham and a man named Kevin McClory) working on a srcipt starring James Bond way back in 1958 I believe it was. Anyway, Fleming found the committee to be relatively useless,left, and then wrote the novel Thunderball, which introduced Blofeld and SPECTRE in to the novels. Shortly afterwards, producers Albert R. Broccoli and his pal Harry Saltzman wanted to start a series of Bond films. Kevin McClory felt he had originated Blofeld and SPECTRE and some of Thunderball`s story line and that Fleming had<BR>stolen the ideas from him. And Kevin wasn`t about to let Thunderball go to the screen without him. The legal battles that went one are to complicated, but what came out of this was: Fleming would retain the literary rights to one Enrst Stavro Blofeld and SPECTRE, while McClory would retain the screen rights. Albert and Harry were free to film a filmed version of Thunderball as long as McClory was the producer. In addition, McClory was allowed to produce his own remake of the story, just as long as he didn`t start production until after 1975. The legal battles are also the reason why Blofeld doesn`t appear in any of the films after Diamonds are Forever was released in 1971 (except as an unnamed character in the pre-credits seqeunce of For Your Eyes Only, Broccoli`s good riddance to whole damn mess). Never Say Never Again is McClory`s remake of Thunderball. <BR>And unfortunately, he did`nt have the rights to any of the series<BR>trademarks, though, so unfortunately, you will not hear the immortal James Bond theme or see the famous gunbarrel opening. McClory obtained Sean Connery for the role of agent 007, who vowed that after Diamonds Are Forever he would NEVER play Bond AGAIN (hence the title of this movie). The cast for the film is absolutely wonderful, except Kim Basinger is not good as Domino, (Claude Auger played a much better Domino in Thunderball). I tell you, this film is awesome, it`s a hell of a lot better then the different but good Octopussy which was released in the same year. And that flawed ending, is okay.

B000069HKH|4.0|The album definitely reflects Bruce's and the country's mood after the September 11th tragedy.  It's very obvious.  I knew that going in, but after I finished listening to it, I thought - \\"that's not their usual sound.\\"  Then I read up on it and found out they brought in another producer who tweaked the Boss and E-Street sound I love.<br />The album contains 3 powerful, emotion-filled songs - \\"Paradise,\\" \\"You're Missing\\" and \\"Nothing Man.\\"  The best song is probably the title track, \\"The Rising.\\"  The album doesn't rock much, so expect more ballads.  In my opinion, \\"The Fuse\\" is a waste of a track and shouldn't have been put on the album.  If you are hoping to hear Bruce's and E-Street's typical sound, then just listen to \\"Mary's Place\\" and you'll be set.<br />I was a little disappointed Clarence didn't get more time on this one.  They didn't give him a lot of room on the album.<br />Overall, I think it's a good album.  I wouldn't say it's one of his greatest, but if you're a Boss fan, you have to have it.  Also, if you're looking for a CD that captures the feelings of the country during the tragedy, then this is the CD.
B00005BCPC|4.0|While I felt Mansfield Park was not one of Jane Austen's best books, I felt that the movie was so different that many could be disappointed and insulted with it. I would have been thoroughly insulted as well, but I watched it as if it was just another movie. It was a very well done movie, better than most movies out there, however do not watch it if you think movies should not be changed at all or very much. <br />Pride and Prejudice (1995) was a six hour movie, but this was only 2 hours, and I understand the need to cut out several parts of the book. But parts such as the play were not included in the great detail it was in the book, because it happened to be a big part of the book.<br />Characters- Sir Thomas was not, in my opinion, a person who would think of incest towards his niece! In the movie she made it out that he was a villain but in the book when he noticed fanny's change, fanny had thought that she regretted not loving him enough and wishing him to not return home, he did not look at her in a way that was less than decent.<BR>Fanny- way too confident, not weak enough, and while placing jane austen's juvenalia was an interesting concept it changed much of fanny's personality, making her much more opinionated.<BR>Mary Crawford-in the movie she seemed to be bisexual and attracted to fanny, she was not at all like that in the book.<BR>Edmund-ignored throughout the movie. I actually wanted Fanny to end up with crawford in the movie! And when she ended up with edmund I could hardly care less.<BR>She also changed other characters but I'm sure other reviewers made comments about that already.<br />She never ever accepted the proposal! That's all I have to say.<br />The commentary is interesting however it confused my opinion on what I thought the book was. Reading other reviews I see that she misinterpreted the book heavily.<br />The movie is still enjoyable, but don't expect anything like the book.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is a very interesting story about a bombardier named Yossarian stationed in Italy during WWII...The whole world seems crazy in this novel and there are plenty of crazy characters that inhabit it. It might sound weird to say, but there really isn't a plot in this story. It's just a bunch of funny and sometimes sad events told in a nonchronological order. This would make the story confusing, but since there isn't really a plot it doesn't really matter. Reading this novel one can tell there are many layers and meanings, but it's not neccessary to delve too deeply into these meanings as the book can be read just for it's hilarity. I found some parts to be laugh-out-loud funny. This book is somewhat hard to describe and one can really only appreciate it if they read it. It's worth reading and I personally got through it very quickly...
B00005JLDW|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was reminded, as was the ... reviewer, of 1981's \\"Dragonslayer\\".  After having seen \\"Reign\\", I am sure that this is life an extension of the former film.<br />Let's just say that one of the offspring of the dragon slain by Peter MacNichol in the earlier film had survived, existing in the caverns underneath \\"merry Olde England\\".  It was then \\"awakened\\" by Alice Kringe and crew, brought back to wreck havoc on the Earth.<br />Thus, this set up for this film allows McConaughey, Bale, and their respective motley crew to do battle with the progeny of this creature.<br />There are some lapses in logic and the dialog is rather wooden, but the film is still a pretty decent way to spend an afternoon.<br />Hopefully, the theater is well air-conditioned...'cause the dragons in the film are HOT!

B000066I6N|5.0|Great album, one of the best from Plant's solo repertoire. As musically adventurous as anything he has done, yet it also has some beautiful, mellow ballads, and on the whole is probably the quietest album he has made. But he has not abandoned the exotic flourishes we've come to expect of him, and in places, he shows he can still rock hard. There are 6 covers, 2 originals, and 2 tracks with songwriting credited to the band but incorporating some older blues standards. The album is more blues oriented than we've heard from him since early Zep. I remember years ago reading a review of a Rolling Stones album where the reviewer criticized one song by derisively calling it &quot;painfully slow blues&quot;. I thought, &quot;but I LIKE painfully slow blues!&quot;. Well, my favorite on this album is a cover of Jesse Colin Young's &quot;Darkness, Darkness&quot;, and if anything deserves to be described as painfully slow blues, it is this. Another highlight is Skip Spence's &quot;Skip's Song&quot;, I wasn't familiar with it but it features a beautiful melody that moves in totally unpredictable yet wonderful directions. Great cover of Dylan's &quot;One More Cup Of Coffee&quot;, with a lovely flamenco acoustic lead guitar. I like the fact that all the songs he covers that I was familiar with from other versions sound totally different here. Better, for the most part, although I'm not crazy about his version of &quot;Hey Joe&quot;. Anyway, if you don't mind Plant mellowing somewhat as he gets older, then you'll probably enjoy this.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I didn't get it.  Other than loving the fact that children everywhere were finding the joy of reading thanks to a little boy named Harry, I didn't get what the fuss was all about.  Well, my brother bought the Harry Potter DVD, and I was excited to see it, but I had no idea what it would mean to my life.  After viewing the movie once, I decided to purchase my own copy so as to get it in widescreen, and have viewed the movie 6 times in total.  Also, after viewing the movie, I picked up the first book (and I suggest everyone do so).  I read it, bought the second one, read it, bought the third and fourth ones and read them.  Harry Potter has quickly dominated my life.  <br />The movie adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the most accurate novel to film adaptions I have ever seen.  It is entertaining, beautiful, and very well acted.  I especially love the kids in the movie (which is strange for a cynic such as myself).  This movie rushed to one of my all-time favorite movie slots.  While watching it I flashed back to such all time greats as The Wizard of Oz and Star wars.  I felt 6 again, I felt the cynicism melt away.  Harry Potter is a movie you should at least try to watch, and if you like it at all, I do suggest the books (all of them).  I don't know how they'll do it, but I hope they can make all of the books into movies.  Even, or especially since it's my favorite, the 735 page Goblet of Fire.
B00005NWM3|4.0|Nickelback evolved quite a bit from both CURB and THE STATE. SILVER SIDE UP showcases some grungy cut-rate metallic power with melody and emotion. I was quite surprised after buying the album, and hearing some of the other tracks on here. &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; may have been the first single, but it wasn't the only good song on this disc.<br />The disc kicks off with the teeth-clenching riffs of the new single &quot;Never Again&quot;, a song with a tale of spousal/domestic abuse, and about the intolerance for it. Then, of course, &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, the catchy first single from the album. &quot;Too Bad&quot; is a good song to relate to if you haven't had the father in your life you've always wished you did. &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; seems to be about the end of a relationship, the realization it's over. The guitars were also good and so was the solo on this track.<br />&quot;Good Times Gone&quot; was a treat because Ian Thornley of Big Wreck does some slick slide guitar on the track, and makes a welcome addition to the crunch it has. Nickelback doesn't, however, rely on guest appearances to beef it's album up; they are fully capable musicians by themselves.<br />Overall, SILVER SIDE UP was a worthy follow-up to THE STATE, which wasn't as good as SILVER SIDE UP. All of Nickelback's albums are good; SILVER SIDE UP just shows, though, that they can paint some pretty realistic portraits of life with melodic, angry riffs and some nice rhythms to complete those portraits.
0345448898|5.0|In short, this was absolutely the best series of books I have ever read. Philip Pullman manages to create a world that you feel a part of equipped with a cast of characters that you will love and cherish. The series can at times seem heart-wrenchingly sad, hopeful, or deeply philosophical. Although I do not recommend this series for children under the age of 13, I do think that teenagers and adults alike will adore the adventures of Lyra, the ever-endearing Pantalaimon, Will, and many more. And at a great bargain like this, you should definitely buy this now!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I was so excited to see Spiderman, having visited many of the web sites that cater to the upcoming film lovers.<br />No disappointment here...wonderful adaptation of the comic.<BR>Mary Jane calls PP \\"Tiger\\", how true to comic cornyness can you get?<br />I've seen it twice and hopefully once more before it leaves theatres..then, i will preorder and anxiously await the DVD.
0962477060|5.0|I came to this book as a 20-something with her first guitar as a recent birthday gift. I had experience playing the piano, but nothing too impressive, got into some intermediate theory. My experience with the violin was equally unimpressive (and far more punishing for anyone in earshot). After a while of playing around, and after the fun of songbooks by my favourite artists had worn off, I wanted to get started for real. My main problem was that I was sure the guitar must make *sense* somehow--I'm no good at math or physics, but even I knew the spacing of the strings had to lead to a system. But what was it?<br />Thank goodness I found this book before things got so infuriating I quit. I wonder for how many people that's happened. Bill Edwards presents the fretboard as something that, purposely or miraculously, makes sense. Understanding the system prevents you from getting lost or feeling that everything you do right is luck; it allows you to manipulate the guitar. I bought the Special Edition (Fretboard Logic SE), and I would definitely recommend anyone else doing the same. The first book is good, but you'll want more, and I think that on it's own its not enough. I am now on the third book, which is also very helpful.<br />Make no mistakes, this book isn't a gimmick. You won't be a singer/songwriter by the end, you won't have a catalogue of songs, you won't speak french in 30 days, shed 90% of your body fat, lose 10 years of wrinkles and blemishes... This book just shows you how to make sense of the fretboard, and it is the most effective way I've experienced or heard of (I had two other popular guitar books, and have put up with endless stories of friends' failed guitar lessons). It will help you in leaps and bounds, but nothing can *make* you a guitar player.<br />The book is surprisingly user-friendly, though I did have to go back and re-read things, or give it a day and try again later. I do have issues with how he presented augmented forms and some of the sevenths in Book Two (I've noticed misprints and he could've been clearer about where the point of reference--not always the barre--is located in relation to the \\"full forms\\"). Don't get too discouraged if it gets laborious or temporarily beyond you. It's a lot to absorb and understand! It does take work, but you'll be rewarded infinitely, because the guitar begins to open up instead of being a sterile tool upon which you can whip out some memorised cords or riffs. I wholeheartedly recommend this book, and maybe some songbooks so you can experience the pleasure of playing \\"actual songs\\" that you will recognise and enjoy. <br />Before you can do anything you dream of, or anything meaningful at all, you have to understand the guitar. This helps. Now go practise.
B000069CWE|5.0|Finally the new Linkin Park CDhas come in and it's great. Most people think that this CD is just all the songs from Hybrid Theory remixed. Not true. There are 8 new tracks, well sorta new, like My December and High Voltage. Most of the songs on this album have nw words such as In the End. I recommended this CD to everybody thats thinking but getting it.
B000069CWE|5.0|I just went out and got this CD today (July 30th, I even did what they said to which is to wear your Linkin Park T-Shirt to the store that day so everyone knows that you are there for the new CD and to see all the other LP fans) and am very happy with it.  The only thing that makes me sad is that Chester was mostly put to the back of the album.  They just put in his samples and have Mike Shinoda change up the song.  It is mostly an effort by Joe Hahn and Mike Shinoda.<br />This album shouldn't be reviewed as a Linkin Park album, it should be reviewed as a remix album.  This is totally different than their usual stuff.  It's mostly overhauled from it's usual self.  The artwork is great with nice colors and a totally different feel.  Even the titles of the songs have changed.  Points of Authority has changed to PTS.OF.ATHRTY and the rest is changed the same way.  I think it was fun decoding the titles before I even listened to it.<br />P5HNG ME A*WY is probably one of the best remixes on the CD.  It shows Chester's voice rawly.  Some of the lyrics have been changed and remixed while keeping to the Linkin Park name.  Special guests include KoRn's Jonathan Davis, Staind's Aaron Lewis, and Linkin Park's hip hop friend the X-ecutioners. Mostly this is a electronica, rock, and hip hop album.  Yet again the band has taken their art to a new level with Reanimation.<br />Overall, this CD has a different hip hop/electronica/rock hybrid.  I know the Linkin Park fans will be a little disappointed with a totally hip hop/electronica but I am not.  If you are disappointed with this effort than wait and hope for the next original release that should be coming out by the end of the year.  For now, Linkin Park \\"Reanimation\\" will be in my CD player until they come out with another.
B00006690H|4.0|This is a very good album. Even though it's edited, you still can tell what kind of curse words he is saying. So I recommend this album for ages 6 and up. You better go listen to this album now kids. <br />WARNING: Dear Adults: Even though this album is edited, it may contain some sequences of sex and violence. Thanks.
B000002KIE|4.0|Punk kind of always existed but the sex pistols finally made it a genre. They were the first to try this sound that mixed zero instrumental talent and offensive screeching vocals. Definatley not the most talented band ever, but definatley one of the most interesting. A revolution in music, but burn it of the internet instead of buying a cd you wont really want to listen to over and over.
0780619609|5.0|I have watching Turtles since I was little. I used to watch the cartoons everyday. I just recently bought TMNT: The Movie on DVD. I still have the action figures that my parents bought for me when I was like 3 yrs. old. My dad packed them away thinking they would be worth something one day. I also have the comic book adaption of TMNT 3.  I can't wait to get the second and third movies on DVD.
0871137380|5.0|As fate would have it, I had just finished reading Mark Bowden's \\"Blackhawk Down\\" when my son broke the news to me that he was about to be deployed to fight in our War Against Terror. Shaken, I told him I don't know why we have to do this, and why HE has to do this. During a quietly emotional, thoughtful, philosophical moment together, my son said he wanted to give me something to help me understand why America DOES have to do this, and why he and all the other wonderful young men and women in our Armed Forces are proud to do what they are doing, actually for each and every American here in the USA. Alongside my copy of \\"Blackhawk Down\\", he placed his own copy of another book I had never seen before called \\"West Point: Character Leadership ...\\" by Norman Thomas Remick and said this book about what America is all about will help me to understand, and will be good to read after reading \\"Blackhawk Down\\". I'm still scared, but that book has helped me put \\"Blackhawk Down\\" into perspective and come to terms with my fear for my boy's life. After reading \\"Blackhawk Down\\", you need to read a book like that. \\"Blackhawk Down\\" is so shocking, it leaves you numb. It's a book that hurts. All of you who are hooked on the superheroes who never get hurt or the fictitious Harry Potter type of magic and wizardry maybe should read about real life --- learn and understand that there are things besides money and phoney heroes that make our Country great. Mark Bowden's \\"Blackhawk Down\\" is a book that justly deserves all the praise it has received.

B000066I6N|2.0|Morning Dew and Darkness Darkness are the only songs on this CD worth listing to. These to songs are exceptional but it's not enough to justify buying this CD.
B000068PQ0|5.0|It's a rare but shining joy to realize on first listen that a new record will be a classic. I kept stopping the CD, trying to postpone the disappointment that I thought must be coming, the string of terrible songs at the end of the album. But like the Lips say on track 6: &quot;that moment never came.&quot; If you agree that &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; is one of the best albums of the 1990s, you should stop reading reviews and buy this album. If you haven't heard their previous album, I recommend that you put your brains in a bag and mail them to me, because you're obviously not using them.
B000063V8R|5.0|I have read review after review that has praised the third season of TNG and I absolutely agree with them.  I have always thought that TNG is by far the better Star Trek series compared with, say the new Enterprise series and I'm sorry but that theme tune does not cut it.  It is one typical aspect of that series which comes across as obvious back slapping on the part of America (sorry but true) as opposed to TNG that has none of this as I'm sure Gene wanted and is all the better for it.  That said, all the scripts are improved as a result of writer reorganisation at the time and it shows.  <br />As a series this ranks as the best along with Season 5 but as a DVD set I have my misgivings.  As one other review noted unlike say, X-Files, there are no commentaries of any kind, no deleted scenes or even bloopers.  (I have heard that there are reels archived away) therefore like the other sets they are let down by this.  That said this is still worth owning as Paramount won't be re-releasing these sets with all new extras any time soon (or at least they better not).<br />Everyone has given an episode by episode account of the series but all I feel inclined to say is this: Borg.  There are no obvious let downs in the season but then I never felt that let down by the first seasons when I first saw them.  The difference with the third season is it stands up to the test of time.<br />Amazon offer the best price on this set that I have come across and aside from the little nit picking relating to the features is a fine set.

She has to think quickly, take care of herself and help others when faced with some seriously creepy creatures. <br />This book has great suspense and is a joy to read. Dave McKean's drawings perfectly complement the atmospheric weirdness of the story.
B00005B4GU|4.0|It's no OK Computer, but it's still great.
B000067G3C|5.0|This film is extremely well-constructed and enjoyable.  Jan De Bont smartly realized that an action film is only as good as the characters that embody it.  Even though the basic premise, a bus needs to stay above 50 MPH otherwise it explodes, is intriguing, the smart characters make the implausible action sequences believable.  Everybody likes Sandra Bullock's spot-on reactions and emotions, and Dennis Hopper's manic but not over-the-top villain.  However, even better are the extras on the bus itself.  We see subtle acting by people with which we identify.  There are no goofy one-liners that seem scripted.<br />The movie begins with 11 elevator passengers stuck towards the top of a high-rise.  Keanu Reeves (one of his best roles) and Jeff Daniels are S.W.A.T. team cops assigned to remove the passengers before Dennis Hopper blows the emergency brakes.  Exciting stuff.  The movie then proceeds with the bus story.<br />Jan De Bont graduated into directing with this film, having spent most of his career up until then as a cinematographer (Die Hard, Basic Instinct).  After Twister and Speed 2: Cruise Control, it seems he has graduated again into producing (most recently Spielberg's Minority Report).  He clearly has a gift for action sequences, and let's hope he has the chance to show off his chops again soon - at the wheel.

B000069HKH|4.0|I picked this up not knowing what to expect,was I going to get the amazing rock tales of Born to Run, or the love songs of his 90' albums.  Well I am glad to say it much more like Born to Run.  With songs like Lonesome Day, Your'e Missing, and The Rising it gives hope for America and the world to rise up over the tragedies.  Bruce is back and is the worhty one to bring songs about September 11th together on one album.

B00005JLDW|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent!<br />In a nutshell, a boy's mother and the construction company she works for unearths a dragon in London, which brings about an age in which dragons become the top of the food chain.  The boy, now grown, leads a band of Brits who live in a castle and basically try to keep the human race alive.<br />Enter the hotshot American who claims to be able to kill dragons, along with his small army.  At first, the Brits don't want to have anything to do with the dragonslayers until shown proof in the form of a dragon's tooth and a helicopter in flight - it had been a decade since any human had flown the skies.<br />I think that this was an awesome twist on a story that is usually found in medieval settings.  The effects were great, and I enjoyed the plot as well.  It was especially spectacular on the big screen.  This will definitely become part of my DVD collection once released.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Good film. The plot was so-so, but the action was very good. It's a great popcorn flick that has some quite disturbing images...if you seen the film, you know what I'm talking about.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a French romantic comedy set in Paris and almost told as a fairy tale. Is this a postmodern version of Cinderella? Close, perhaps, but the slipper seems to be a picture. Yes, you get to actually see places in Paris you might have visited. I was especially delighted for that reason.<br /><br />I don't remember the last time I laughed so much while watching a movie. In fact, maybe it was when watching \\"What About Bob.\\" Which proves psychological hilarity does appeal to my sense of humor to the extreme.<br /><br />First you have two obsessive compulsive parents who never fully develop into characters you can admire or dislike. They simply exist in this movie as some sort of semblance of balance for the dysfunctional life Amelie (Audrey Tautou ) has woven her fragile existence between until her parents are torn apart by death. For the first part of her life, she is not shown normal affection and finally retreats into her own imagination. Deprived of love and basic childhood pleasures, like friends, Amelie lacks social skills in various areas, while she seems to survive working as a waitress in an eccentric caf&eacute;.<br /><br />One day her life changes. She is watching the news and is so shocked by the revelation she drops something that rolls to a bathroom tile, that reveals a hidden treasure. She vows to return the treasure to the original owner.<br /><br />There is something beautiful about Amelie's character. She embodies an innocence long forgotten and therefore her vindictive side in regards to the corner grocer will have you rolling on the floor. The man (Mathieu Kassovitz) she falls for is of course even more eccentric than she is and well, he works in a place that might not delight you and there are a few seconds here and there of adult naughtiness. They could have left out the dancer and the shop where he works because technically those items are not really woven well into the story. A more hilarious view is taken of sex in this movie and there are no serious love scenes to be sure. His character is not fully developed and they focus more on Amelie's life and longings.<br /><br />Amelie sees herself as an angel/avenger. Half the time she is helping the eccentric characters find their way to happiness, while the hilarity comes from her attempts to \\"teach\\" other rather rude characters a good lesson. Then Amelie sends her father's garden gnome all over the world and this inspires him to travel. She seems to inspire others to follow their dreams.<br /><br />In the process she discovers that having heart only shows her half the real picture in life. She needs a soul mate to complete her. Being the completely innocent character she is, she would of course find someone who is rather a nonconformist in a way. He spends some of his time collecting torn up pictures from a photo booth and is seeking to solve the mystery of his life. Who is the man who keeps appearing to have his picture taken?<br /><br />Watch for a moment of pure spectacular creativity when water splashes all over the floor. There are artistic moments of bliss in this movie!<br /><br />Nostalgic in places and poignant scenes that will catch you off guard as you find yourself suddenly crying and maybe relating to Amelie in some intimate way as you realize that you too have had dreams that didn't always come true just when you wanted them to.<br /><br />Completely modern movie making and has academic nuances here and there to delight the poet in you. A cozy Parisian Soundtrack is included to match.<br /><br />A similar experience to watching Moulin Rouge because you have an intense desire to watch this over and over again. I think it is just so visually stimulating and the details can hardly be absorbed in one viewing.<br /><br />A feel good movie that leaves you with a sense that<br />there is still beauty and sweet innocence left somewhere in the world.<br /><br />Or maybe that is just a fantasy...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review.

B00004Y6Q5|5.0|&quot;Summer Overture&quot; is one of my favorite pieces of score ever. It's pure genius...Clint Mansell is a genius. If you love this film, you will love this great score. It's a brilliant piece of art.
B000051VWW|3.0|SADE and BONE THUGS-N-HARMONY are 2 of my favorite artists.so i get real hype when i hear something new from one of them.but this cd was a bit of a dissapointment.this sade album lacks the organic feel of her past cds.and its sounds a little bit too modern.and her band seems to be missing. plus the beats are mostly digital,and not live precutions.theres nothing wrong with drum machines,but the ones on here just wasn't interesting. neither was the rest of the digital music.although songs like my hearts been broken are beautiful,and a few other tracks too.but for the most part this album is kinda slow and boring.but it still blew away most of the other garbage that was out at the time.but if this album was from some other singer then this debut would of been off da hook.but sense we know its sade and that she is capable of much more this fact kills any good feed back that would have been given to a debut artist.it just feels average compared to her old work in most fans eyes.BUT most of the problem isn't from sade its the lack luster band.other then that sade's vocals are just as good as they were several years ago.HOPEFULLY if she makes a follow up the band will be more involved.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|Good film and performances from Crowe and Connely. Their best? I don't think so. You want to see their best performances...Go rent/buy L.A. Confidental or The Insider...go rent/buy Requeim for a Dream. Now, those are some fantastic performances and films.<br />Oscar for Howard? That just proves that the Oscars are a huge marketing joke!

B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is without question a songwriter of immense talent and overwhelming emotion. He puts all of his talent to work on this amazing album, finds talent he has not shown before, and gives us a touchstone to remind us of the pain that was September 11th; one that will stand as a testament to those who died, and as hope for all of us. That spirit of unity pervades this fine album, each track another facet of our collective experience, each lyrical passage a complete portrait in itself.<br />Springsteen reunites with the E Street Band on this album, and it couldn't have been any other way. Connecting all of the emotions and stories that came out of Sept. 11th took all of their prodigious talents, and the connection and understanding of each other's abilities pushes Springsteen's phenomenal songs to an even higher place.<br />Every song has at least one perfect passage, one shining moment that moves the deepest part of your soul. In a time when whole albums pass by without a hint of that kind of connection, and in a time when we need that connection more than ever, Springsteen has delivered what has to be considered one of the finest American musical achievements ever. He captures the pain of the lost in the track &quot;You're Missing,&quot; the courage of the fire fighters and police in &quot;Into the Fire,&quot; the emptiness of the survivors in &quot;Nothing Man,&quot; and finds hope in every song, even if it is hidden and almost impossible to hold on to.<br />Capturing the spirit of the living, honoring the memory of the dead, or shining a light of hope through the darkness of grief would be an accomplishment of artistic triumph. Achieving all three in one recording, at times in one song, in one passage, is a miracle.<br />In &quot;Countin' on a Miracle,&quot; &quot;There ain't no storybook story/ There's no never-ending song/ Our happily ever after Darlin'/ forever come and gone/ I'm movin' on/ If I'm gonna believe/ I'll put my faith/ Darlin' in you.&quot; The Boss has it all, lost dreams, recaptured hope, and the resolve to move on. This album is a gift that gives us all the chance to find our own hope, and gives us a knowing friend with a strong shoulder to cry on.<br />It is the most eloquent art about the most horrific events. It is nearly perfect.
B00005V9L1|5.0|No question about it.  This movie has it all.  Acting, effects, storyline, plot.  You name it, it has it baby.  The only thing else i can say is that its, hands down, the best movie of the century so far.  There is not a movie that can touch it.<BR>yeah baby
B00005JLDW|1.0|This movie was poorly made, the only thing that prevented me from walking out was the CGI dragons.  The acting is bordering on indie films and the scenery is the standard apocolyptic cliche, albeit the castle they live in.  Several plot holes easily distract viewers from the (thin) storyline and dialog.  Thinking back on it, I'm not sure any emotion was played out until the last minute or two of the film, and much of the action was standard stuff as well ... this movie was more like a D&D Mad Lib than a hollywood movie. Asides from the decent looking dragons (admittedly they did pull a few stunts to ease their jobs as animators, such as clouds and speed blurs) this movie [is bad].

1577311523|3.0|First I will give my praise to this book for literally opening my eyes about the mind and how it tries to control us. The Power Of Now did an incredible job of convincing me that us humans have really been imprisoned in our minds and Eckhart Tolle does indeed help to lead us out of the pain of our minds into an enlightened state where life is much more peaceful. For this I can't thank Mr. Tolle enough!<br />Now for the downer, I had to cringe half the time when the author quoted the words of Jesus. Too often Eckhart Tolle puts his own meaning into what he wants to believe Jesus said and thus Eckhart will only quote parts of Jesus' words that appear to benefit his own views on spirituality. Jesus taught of a literal heaven and hell and it seems that everyone wants to just skip right past those parts and just read the nice fluffy feel good words of Jesus as Eckhart does. Furthermore, Jesus did NOT teach that \\"Salvation\\" (as Eckhart keeps talking about) was something we find within ourselves but rather true salvation as Jesus teaches is found when we submit our lives to God and ask him to forgive us our sins and have a personal relationship with Jesus. Jesus died on a cross to save us from our sins if we will simply accept him into our lives to find salvation. He was the ultimate sacrifice for us. We are saved by the shedding of his blood and not by merely learning to live in the \\"now\\" as Eckhart teaches. <br />Other than this I wish more people would learn to live presently rather than in the past or future which tends to create pain for us. I only recommend The Power Of Now to people who already have a clear understanding of What Jesus really teaches in the Bible then that way you won't believe Eckhart's editing of Jesus' words.
B000069HKH|2.0|You'll have to rise above the hype and swim against the tide to proclaim just what a major disappointment this album is .. but, take heart; it can be done. Musically disjointed, lyrically self-congratulatory and smelling strongly of a publicity pose, &quot;The Rising&quot; is a misstep worthy of Springsteen's &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; fiasco with little to recommend it except curiosity. Where's the passion we felt with &quot;Live in New York City&quot;? Why bring back the E Street Band only to bury it in a melange of sappy strings and sonic garbage? Whose idea was it to exploit September 11 to sell this thing ... on the MTV Music Awards, ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; and NBC's &quot;Today Show,&quot; no less? I've been a Springsteen fan since the beginning and this sub-average album makes me wonder whether it's time to be a lot more selective when it comes to his future efforts. It's starting to look and sound like product placement and brand marketing in BruceLand.
B000069HKH|5.0|Lets be clear: we will never get another 'Born To Run' or 'Darkness On The Edge of Town'.  Those times are gone.  BUT, Bruce can deliver something meaningful and relevant in the present.<br />This album delivers in spades.  From the wonderful opener, through the hugely enjoyable \\"Waiting on a sunny day\\" and the haunting \\"Nothing man\\" to the pounding \\"Further On Up the Road\\" and the majestic \\"My City of Ruins\\".<br />Like all albums, this contains a few duds (\\"The Fuse\\" being one) but for 73 minutes you cant get much better, and I defy anyone not to just wanna sing along to \\"Mary's Place\\".<br />Also, the emphasis has been placed on 9/11 far too much. This is NOT a 9/11 album at all. Columbia should be ashamed of themselves for marketing it like that. These songs are relevant and meaningful to ALL people (even me - 3000 miles away from New York).  \\"You're Missing\\" and \\"Paradise\\" are moving in deeper ways than most of todays artists could ever manage.<br />So, buy this album and absorb it into your blood. In my opinion, it ranks 3rd behind the two albums I started the review with. Not bad for a 52 year old!!!!<br />Roll on 2003 when I can see him live...
0141301074|4.0|This is a WEIRD and funny book. I read it aloud to 4th and 5th graders. Be careful, there are things I chose to leave out...parts about drinking beer, etc. etc. and violence between man and wife, but the kids really saw the humor in it!
B0000025D0|5.0|'Darkness On The Edge of Town,' stark, staring, and pure to its core, stands as one of the defining moments of rock 'n roll.<br /><br />Charting a course of earnest youthful rebellion through a barren, stripped-away landscape of working class frustration and hopelessness, the album's protagonist repeatedly strikes out to forcibly carve his own opportunities for freedom, salvation, belief, and transcendence. These themes, the distilled essences of rock 'n roll, have been written into song thousands of times before 1978 and since, but few rock 'n roll performers have ever achieved quite as singular and powerful a vision as Springsteen does here.<br /><br />Presenting a far less enthusiastic persona that he did on the previous 'Born To Run' (1975), this album finds the Springsteen character past the initial golden rush of youth, thrills, and new frontiers and abruptly confronted suddenly with the unyielding face of reality's harsh and sobering truths.<br /><br />Writing with a sharp insight and wisdom he would later largely relinquish, Springsteen tackles, with a good view from the wrong side of the tracks, the inevitable toil, toll, and hardships of life, the inexorable and corroding passage of time, the dark psychology of the unexamined life, and, significantly, the problems of the father, but not those of the mother, who, unaddressed, quietly suffuses the album and may lie behind most of its presented struggles.<br /><br />Springsteen is smart enough throughout to acknowledge his own culpability, and on 'Prove It All Night,' sings of the thrill of transgression, stealing, cheating and lying, something Springsteen, standing in proud judgement like the king of the mountain, believes the square 'suits' in the good part of town will never know.<br /><br />Finding precious relief and moments of salvation in lust, the pursuit of love and women, drag racing, acts of defiance, and the night itself, Springsteen achieves a pure daemonic epiphany in \\"Streets of Fire,\\" the record's black center.<br /><br />Having abandoned life, society, and himself in a frenzy of spiritual destitution and derelict intensity, the singer, \\"a loser down these tracks,\\" remembers a nighttime walk to the place he used to drag race with others, and 'in the darkness\\" hears somebody call his name. But this is very likely not the voice of another person, but a vision, delusion, or transcendent force: this is a confrontation and communion, Springsteen's dark night of the soul. Does he answer? If so, what occurs? The listener is never told. In the aftermath of the experience he is doubly disenfranchised, \\"talking only to strangers,\\" walking \\"with angels who have no place.\\"<br /><br />In spasmodic rock orgasm 'Candy's Room,' a more confident Springsteen actively pursues another epiphany in the mythologically-imagined Candy, half high school virgin, half New Jersey moll and sad-eyed Mater Dolorosa who \\"can make men do anything she wants.\\" Our hero travels down the vaginal darkness of 'Candy's hall' as if through a gauntlet to her bedroom, where, surrounded by \\"pictures of her heroes,\\" he is confident that \\"what she wants is..me.\\" Numinous Candy, all-encompassing, takes eager control, and lusty Springsteen is blissfully absorbed.<br /><br />The album moves easily between rousing and deeply-felt anthems of will and determination, apocalyptic visions and revenge fantasies (Springsteen imagines a phallic tornado--his 'size does matter' proxy--descending from the sky and destroying the town), thoughtful ruminations, and poignant songs of quiet acceptance concerning life's inherent sadness and tragedies, such as 'Racing In The Streets' and 'The Working Life.'<br /><br />But 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town' is also a grueling document of an isolated loner's counter-projections towards society, one who has an equal potential for bias, assumption, violence, and inaccuracy.<br /><br />On later albums, Springsteen would lose much of the rigorous self-honesty that made 'Darkness onthe Edge of Town' possible.<br /><br />Becoming slowly but increasingly lukewarm and maudlin, the forces he and his characters battle remaining too generalized, unfocused and never exactly targeted, he would devolve into the champion of those who cannot cope, adapt, or evolve through the minimum stages of adult life.<br /><br />In light of the aura of victimization and finger-pointing that clouds his later work, it does not surprise that Springsteen appears on VH1 and other programs today not as a self-fulfilled and self-responsible man who has fought his battles and won, but, thick-set, torpid, and inarticulate, like one of the downtrodden and defeated men of his early lyrics.<br /><br />The great 'rebel heroes' of the 20th century, such as Marlon Brando, Jack Kerouac, Elvis Presley and James Dean, either died young by the code they lived by, or, in middle age, pasty, bloated and gender-erased, become caricatures not of themselves but of their mothers, whose influence they have spent a lifetime running from but have never escaped.<br /><br />Never having specifically located and accepted his own limitations, Springsteen, the fiery yet earthbound romantic, would soon see his problems generating everywhere but at their source, and, blinded, become his own oppressor.<br /><br />The 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' album art bravely portrays a sallow-faced Springsteen, emaciated, hung-over or strung out, perpetually about to go to bed or just waking up.<br /><br />The struggle for clarity, briefly won moment-to-moment here, Springsteen lost with time, as his vision expanded laterally but stopped moving forward.<br /><br />It may be that Springsteen, \\"tied and bound\\" by the umbilical cord of his complexes, spent himself early, leaving himself with nothing to produce but retreads of broken ideals.<br /><br />Defiant Springsteen shouts \\"Hey mister, I ain't a boy, I'm a man,\\" on this album; but the protagonist of 'The River' gets his girlfriend pregnant and so figuratively puts his head right in the oven, when unwanted or unplanned pregnancy is something millions of people around the globe cope with without permanent sulking or a sense of fatality.<br /><br />Are these actions and attitudes those of a boy, or of a man? Listeners may forward to the day when a Springsteen character, down on his luck, fired, or laid off, says resourcefully, \\"so I took some computer classes at the community college and eventually found work.\\"<br /><br />But on 'Darkness on the Edge of Town,' like a ten-song elaboration of British folk-singer Ewan MacColl's classic \\"Dirty Old Town,\\"with its themes of youthful innocence, love, disillusionment, anger, and violence, Springsteen, disconsolate idealist, got it absolutely right.the Edge of Town' possible.<br /><br />Becoming slowly but increasingly lukewarm and maudlin, the forces he and his characters battle remaining too generalized, unfocused and never exactly targeted, he would devolve into the champion of those who cannot cope, adapt, or evolve through the minimum stages of adult life.<br /><br />In light of the aura of victimization and finger-pointing that clouds his later work, it does not surprise that Springsteen appears on VH1 and other programs today not as a self-fulfilled and self-responsible man who has fought his battles and won, but, thick-set, torpid, and inarticulate, like one of the downtrodden and defeated men of his early lyrics.<br /><br />The great 'rebel heroes' of the 20th century, such as Marlon Brando, Jack Kerouac, Elvis Presley and James Dean, either died young by the code they lived by, or, in middle age, pasty, bloated and gender-erased, become caricatures not of themselves but of their mothers, whose influence they have spent a lifetime running from but have never escaped.<br /><br />Never having specifically located and accepted his own limitations, Springsteen, the fiery yet earthbound romantic, would soon see his problems generating everywhere but at their source, and, blinded, become his own oppressor.<br /><br />The 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' album art bravely portrays a sallow-faced Springsteen, emaciated, hung-over or strung out, perpetually about to go to bed or just waking up.<br /><br />The struggle for clarity, briefly won moment-to-moment here, Springsteen lost with time, as his vision expanded laterally but stopped moving forward.<br /><br />It may be that Springsteen, \\"tied and bound\\" by the umbilical cord of his complexes, spent himself early, leaving himself with nothing to produce but retreads of broken ideals.<br /><br />Defiant Springsteen shouts \\"Hey mister, I ain't a boy, I'm a man,\\" on this album; but the protagonist of 'The River' gets his girlfriend pregnant and so figurativelyputs his head right in the oven, when unwanted or unplanned pregnancy is something millions of people around the globe cope with without permanent sulking or a sense of fatality.<br /><br />Are these actions and attitudes those of a boy, or of a man?

B000001DTM|5.0|Since Sgt. Pepper's, this is the best album of the post-beatles era. (Sorry Led, Rolling, Pink Floyd, etc.) This album defined a path for the music in the 90's. And if you consider U2 as the greatest band on earth, and this album as their best ever, you have someting big here!
067942850X|5.0|&quot;Into the Wild&quot; is one of those treasures you rarely find in non-fiction media. This is a journey of ultimate freedom. Chris McCandless walks away from a life that many would envy. He becomes a nomad in a country that cherishes stability and security. He bravely did what most people just talk about. His adventures in the underground realm of the United States of America are truly fascinating. I admire his love and pursuit for such a raw freedom, but it scares me to even think about doing something similar. I just simply find the whole account of his journey fascinating, yet very haunting. Nature can be a dangerous playground, especially for us post-modern, urban Americans. I can't help but think what Chris McCandless did is not that out of the ordinary for most other countries, but shows how we, Americans, are too comfortable with our security and stability to truly be free. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B000067CPX|2.0|Okay, its not quite that bad, but that was my reaction on the first listen  - because stylistically, with hooks this big (\\"Zephyr song\\" i skip everytime), ballads aplenty, and production this overdone (\\"midnight\\") its hard to tell the difference. The rock funk hybrid that made the Chili's distinctive/musically interesting only appears on \\"By The Way\\" (the hardest rocking song on the album), \\"Can't Stop\\" and a few others (and \\"Venice Queen\\" is cool). this isnt taking their sound to a new place, its ditching all together for some conventential, classic rock, easy listening. at this rate of \\"maturation\\" the chilis are destined to become the 21st century's eagles - catchy, inoffensive, mild & bland.<br />yeah, a few songs grew on me, but this one is bound for early retirement from my cd player. this from someone who was permantently attached to BSSM when it came out and who's summer of '99 was spent with californication as soundtrack. <br />A massive disappointment - led me to write my first amazon review. I recommend sonic youth's \\"murray street\\" for a band that still keeps it interesting

B000002TLX|5.0|What song does one think of when you say the name Richard Marx??  In most cases people would answer &quot;Right Here Waiting.&quot;  Well, to be honest, that is not his only #1.  It's perhaps his biggest song, but this CD proves that he is most certainly an artist for the ages.  This disc is Marx's best of as of 1997, and it truly is what it calls itself....his greatest hits.  Contained within are rock songs, uptempo pop tunes, and of course the ever-so-wonderful ballads.  Marx seems to shine in all of these areas.  &quot;Should've Known Better,&quot; is a nice rocker, &quot;Take This Heart,&quot; is an awesome pop song, and &quot;Surrender To Me&quot; is a great duet done with Lara Fabian.  Continuing on in the duet department is &quot;The Way She Loves Me.&quot;  This was done with Lionel Ritchie and Luther Vandross and is simply a great 3-part harmony song.  The uptempo &quot;Angelia,&quot; a song with a bit of a twist, rocker &quot;Satisfied,&quot; and rocker &quot;Don't Mean Nothing&quot; are also found here.  Ballads &quot;Now &amp; Forever,&quot; &quot;Hold Onto The Nights&quot; and of course the smash &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; fill up more great aspects of Marx's career.  Other gems include the beautiful &quot;Angel's Lullaby,&quot; and &quot;Children Of The Night.&quot;  &quot;Angel's Lullaby was written for his sons, where as &quot;Children Of The Night&quot; draws inspiration from the stories of street-youth.  Both phenomenal pieces of music.  This disc is full of everything you could ask for in a greatest hits disc: a mix of everything from a career, a few new treats, and some great stories.  Richard Marx may not be at the top of the charts right now, but he is most certainly an artist that knows how to create music.  Once you buy this CD, you'll be spending &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot; listening to it, singing along and trying to pick out your one favourite....until his next greatest hits collection is released that is.
B000069CWE|5.0|'Reanimation' is possibly one of the best remixed albums from a rock band ever. Some consider this as the clone to Limp Bizkit's &quot;Old New Songs&quot; which also featured previous tracks remixed into new beats. However the music in itself is where the two differ, anybody who will listen to this album will hear completely different tracks than those of 'Hybrid Theory', yet most of the lyrics do undoubtedly remain the same. After the success of 'HB', this album is fitting, something all the fans knew Linkin Park would put out and they did it well...maybe too well..I highly recommend it.
0060005424|4.0|While Lirael, the hero of this engaging book (heroine is a politically incorrect term), is a magnificant character, Sameth, the worthless royal prince (\\"worthless\\" being my adjective, although many of the characters would agree wholeheartedly), is a complete bore. He's indecisive, unpossessing, and purile. Were it not for my devotion to Lirael, dirived from an earlier portion of the book dedicated solely to her, I don't believe I could have held on through Sameth's alotment. Being a Garth Nix fan, that was quite an unexpected experience for me. Only the knowledge that in the end I would again see my beloved character kept me from drowning in my own drool as I dozed through the middle.<br />HOWEVER!<br />Lirael did come back, older and wiser and--YES!--distainful of Sameth! It was a moment of joy. Their first meeting was one of those delightful experiences in which the characters come head to head in some sort of mutual misunderstanding or disagreement which in the end will be resolved to the:<BR> a) common good, <BR> b) dismay of the bad person (again, specifying gender--ie. bad guy/ girl--would be politically incorrect), or <BR> c) both A and B.<BR>In the end it was posible to forgive Sameth for being a terrible main character and well as a terrible prince. Or so was the case for me. Perhaps other readers will not be so magnamious.<br />But that one scene was not the inspiration of my forgiveness. I forgave that minor flaw in the wake of a much larger one: the book did not end. In fact, it barely even paused. The phrase \\"to be continued\\" is not something I have ever had much patience with. I'd always rage in front of the telivision when I found out I'd have to wait until tomorrow. Imagine the state of my house after being told I have to wait over a year (although now only a few months and a few unbroken objects remain, my computer being one of the articles in that catigory--imagine that).<br />I need to kick something. Don't expect to hear from me again; my monitoris moments away from being broken by a foot.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album is \\"anything but ordinary\\".  I've listened to all of the songs on this album numerous times and just can't get enough of them! My definite favorites are \\"My World\\", \\"I'm with you\\", and \\"things i'll never say\\". In \\"my world\\" avril completely covers american suburbia.  it's the story of her life, and she made it into a wonderful track.  it's very upbeat, and the chorus is awesome.  \\"I'm with you\\", this song is just..pretty. that's the only word i can think of to describe it. it just sounds like a really pretty song. a very sad song, but she makes it sound refreshing. and last but definitely not least, \\"things i'll never say\\", this is a song about holding inside your emotions and dying to let them out! another upbeat song, with an excellent chorus.  <BR>   i'm sure that a lot of you have only heard avril's single \\"complicated\\", honestly, it's not one of my favorites, to really get to know avril you have to listen to more than just this song, the others cover all of the blank spots for you ;) . do yourself a favor and go out and buy this cd, you won't be sorry!
B000069HKH|1.0|As someone who watches and listens to the AMAZING &quot;Live from NYC&quot; DVD, I am SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED by this CD.<br />This is NOT Rock and Roll. <br />It's whiney and dark ballads.<br />This is definitely NOT what I expected from Bruce and company.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|'Poses' is probably the best Rufus CD (well, he only has two) for the uninitiated.  It is more modern and mature than his first release (Rufus Wainwright) and shows more musical sensitivity.  With a pop feel reminiscent of classic artists like the Beatles', 'Poses' showcases influences from Edith Piaf, opera, and even trip-hop (on 'Shadows').<br />It took me some time to adjust to the somewhat nasal quality of Rufus' voice.  However, this was much more evident on 'Rufus Wainwright' than on 'Poses' and by the time I had listened to the CD a few times, I was impressed by the depth and richness of his voice and found that the &quot;whiny&quot; edge set it off even better and gave it a rather jaded and world-weary quality.<br />This CD is wonderful all the way through, and you will never find yourself in need of the fast-forward button (except of course, if you are finding a particular favorite, such as 'Grey Gardens' for me).  A talented melodist comparable to Leonard Cohen (though inarguably a better singer), Rufus' songs never get boring and can be listened to over and over again.<br />I would also recommend finding Rufus' cover of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, and the Beatles' &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (available on the re-release of 'Poses' and the 'I am Sam Soundtrack').  Also, if you get a chance to see Rufus live, he is even better singing in person than on the CD.
B000067CPX|4.0|This is an album worth owning. It has great sonic qualities and the songs are strong. The band plays great and Flea plays (as usual) like a magic monster. The RHCP have a very interesting sound that continues to evolve. I suspect the more neanderthal types will find it too soft but I feel this is a very strong move forward. In particular, DON'T FORGET ME is a beautiful song with a vocal destined for true classic status. All in all, a killer record with muscle and heart. A solid piece of work by a great band.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne really did it. Though she is a young singer, she is really good. I really like her song, \\"Complicated.\\" I like her better than Britney Spears, Pink and Christina Aguilira by a long shot! I like her because she has good topics that she focuses on in her singing whereas Britney Spears talks about boys and intimacy. She is a really good singer and you should consider buying her CD!
B00003CWN3|5.0|While I would never mistake Hilary Swank for a man I did find the acting in this movie to be brilliant. I didn't think I'd like the movie when it first started out. I hated the \\"white trash\\" moronic Southern style the movie started out with. I just know that if I lived near ANY of the people in this movie I'd pack my bags and move! Anyway, the movie really picks up when Hilary Swank is found out to be a woman and what happens to her is just horrible. Her death is very disturbing and even more disturbing is the mother who was murdered right in front of her infant child. There is some lesbian love scenes in this movie which might make some feel uncomfortable but they are necessary to strengthen the story.
6305268843|5.0|I am a Sophie Marceau fan.  She can't make a bad movie.  I didn't like her little girl, but I guess I wasn't supposed to.  The end of the movie is wonderful.  The violin music is gorgeous, and for the last two years I have been looking for this to be put on DVD in widescreen, waiting for my VCR to eat the tape at any time.  I see no sign that Buena Vista will put this on DVD, and by bad luck, it had to be Hollywood Pictures, part of the Disney conglorate, that made this movie.  The Disney crowd delights in coming up with new degrees of Macrovision, so the owned copy cannot be transferred to another tape or a be recorded to DVD-R to preserve the movie, which does not get put on DVD by the studio, while unimaginable ... does get marketed on DVD by the Disney crowd.

B000063JDE|5.0|\\"Blue Velvet\\" is one of the best movies of all time. David Lynch is Hollywood's finest director, and \\"Blue Velvet\\" is his best work. \\"Blue Velvet\\" is a shocking, disturbing, and yet brilliant masterpiece telling the tale of a hidden world that could exist in every small town. It greatly portrays how a seemingly nice neighborhood can be a portal into a world of unimaginable perversions. Kyle McLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, and Laura Dern all give brilliant performances. Kyle McLachlan is brilliant in the role of Jeffrey Beumont. He portrays his journey from boyhood into manhood with great poise. He has an air about him that portrays his loss of innocense greatly. Isabella Rossellini in her third film of her career took on a most challenging role of Dorothy Vallens. The seemingly perfect, yet tortured nightclub singer. She handled the many challenges of her role like a true actress. Dennis Hopper is just plain scary in this movie. His portrayal of Frank Booth is one that could not have been handled by any other actor. Hopper had recently come out of drug rehab, and was encouraged not to take this role. Because playing a violent, ritualistic sadist would not help his image with the public. But Hopper took the role because he believed in the story. All of the actors did, because due to many circumstances in making a film so original, the actors basically did this movie for free. Exactly like the actors in the recent movie \\"Monster's Ball\\" David Lynch was nominated for Best Director at the 1986 Academy Awards, but did not win. I feel that is a crime in every sense. You can't make a movie like \\"Blue Velvet\\" and not be a genius, and that is what Lynch is. He is a genius and a visionary in every sense of the word. His careful attention to detail, makes his movies cinematic masterpieces. All of the main actors in \\"Blue Velvet\\" McLachlin, Rossellini, Hopper, and Dern all deserved Oscar nominations, but were snubbed by the Academy. What a shame that when a trulybrilliant movie comes around like \\"Blue Velvet\\" that it is ignored because it is so original. \\"Blue Velvet\\" will give you a new meaning to the words 'movie masterpiece' and will take you on a wild ride that you will never forget. \\"Blue Velvet\\" is moviemaking at its very best.

WORSHIP HIM...YOU WILL GROW FROM WHAT HE HAS TO OFFER There are 2 types of people who purchase this book-and only two types-1)you will use his educational materials STEP by STEP to make REAL advancements-OR 2)you will become a great fan of the author, likely buy many of his materials...and use these materials to comfort yourself..never taking any steps to accomplish what he intended his readers to.  ...Fortunately, 5% or so of the people that read what he has to say DO accept his criticism and put it to good use.  Cashflow quadrant builds on book 1 and his new books continue to advance accordingly  He is a very skilled teacher in that he makes learning fun...the DOWNSIDE to that .is all the people that are thus attracted to him with no intention on DOING anything.
B00005JKNF|5.0|A number of people are invited for a weekend shooting party at the Gosford Park.  Throughout the party there are numerous secrets conveyed both by the aristocrats and the servants.  These are secrets of infidelity, greed, and deception, which display the thin line between the aristocrats and the servants.  It is known that secrets do not make friends, but how dangerous these secrets can be?  An excellent cast (Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Stephen Fry, Clive Owen and many many more) passes an intriguing tale in the light of social-economical differences and in the shades of deceit, greed, love, and murder.
6304080921|4.0|12 Monkeys is a top notch sci-fi scenario focused on Bruce Willis, an agent from the year 2034 who goes back in time to find a virus in its pure form before it wiped out the human race.<br />Madeline Stowe (though too beautiful to be believable in her role as psychiatrist) gradually comes to believe Willis isn't just another lunatic.<br />  Some interesting undercurrents come through which may or may not have been Director Terry Gilliam's intention.  One is when Willis hears the radio and says, &quot;I love the music of the 20th century&quot;...actually what he's listenning to is not music from 1996 but that of the '50s and '60s.  I mean he's not listenning to rap, the Backstreet Boys, Brittany....I think the underlying message is:  what happened to good music, not simply in 2034, but in 1996?<br />  Another message which is more overt is that psychiatry is a flawed (to put it mildly) profession.  We see some pretty bad hospital conditions and some pretty uncaring doctors (except for Stowe of course).  Unfortunately, though an important and true message, it detracts from the main flow of the film.<br />  Now the time travel aspect:  Willis says there is no way to change anything cause it already happened.  Well that opens up a BIG can of contradictory worms.  First, of course his simply being there automatically changes things, not only that, but (Spoiler Alert) why does he run after the guy with the virus at the end if he knew he couldn't change anything?  And why even bother to run away...where can he hide if he knows the virus is about to wipe out humanity?<br />  I did think the scenario where HE is the boy at the airport is very effective and really ties the plot together.  He keeps dreaming of that scene he saw as a kid in the airport and then Stowe recognizes him as the boy.  Interesting time paradox there.  He sees himself...so maybe he couldn't change anything because that's what happened in 1996...he was ORIGINALLY there from the future.<br />  Anyway it's great entertainment and Brad Pitt is hilarious.t's great entertainment and Brad Pitt is hilarious.
B000069CWE|5.0|...But these remixes are very good.  I loved \\"Pushing Me Away\\", it's the perfect song to get you up when you're having a bad day. I can't wait for their next album. Linkin Park rocks!
B00000K19E|5.0|I loved this movie.  I still pop the DVD in, watch it and repeat everyone's dialogue like a kid.  I can't wait for the sequels to come out in 2003.
0780622553|3.0|The movie has its moments. Cool special effects for your big-screen. The objective of the aliens is balmy if you are not a Star Trek fan. Well, one for the DVD library.
B000068R1X|1.0|Yes, indeed...after two largely excellent solo efforts (both of which have since been ruined with new drum and bass tracks by the way--sickening and shameful) in which Ozzy seemed to be keeping up artistically with what his former bandmates Black Sabbath were doing without him, he blows it here. This has a few decent riffs, but nothing more; this is the stupidest and most cornball cheese-metal that had ever been associated with anyone in Sabbath up to that point. 'Bark At The Moon', indeed! Talk about lack of subtlety, it's all over this wretched thing. Well, this sadly isn't the worst record Ozzy would make (they actually would never even be this good again), but kids and burnout metalheads continued to buy his records (in larger numbers than even the vastly, immensely superior records that Black Sabbath were releasing) into the early '90's. Sure. While bands like Venom, Death, Bathory and true metal outfits couldn't get arrested. It figures.

B00003CXE7|1.0|Garbage! Leave it to these new hollywood directors and very bad actors to try to made a serious movie. I'm sorry, but i found this movie very funny. It was totally unbelievable! It should have been titled &quot;Hollywood goes to Rome.&quot;  This was a joke!  If you want to see a great epic and if you can find it, get &quot;The sign of the Cross.&quot;  It's a very early talky but a wonderful story and great acting for it's day. You think Hollywood would have learned something after all these years in the business.  First and foremost Hollywood needs to get actors that can act and not talk with a New York accent.
B000069HKH|5.0|A beautiful and thoughtfully crafted work of art.  Springsteen at his best, dealing with the tragic events of Sept. 11 that have forever changed us all.  Highly recommended.
B000060P79|5.0|this CD is awesome, if your into this kind of genre of music, you'll absolutely love Simple Plan! this CD is totally awesome, go buy it right away
B00003CXI0|5.0|While there are, of course, liberties taken and omissions made from the actual text, this movie is by no stretch of the imagination any less magical than its literary counterpart.  From the first glimpse Diagon Alley, on through to the walls of Hogwarts and out, finally, to the vibrant Quidditch field...this movie is pure magic.  The film also carries today's audiences into what will certainly be an entirely new genre of theater entertainment.  The special effects are amazing.  The original John Williams score is a perfect match.  The casting,(no, it could never quite capture the exact book!), was thoroughly effective.  This movie is end to end fun, adventure, and, well, magic.  Perfect for all ages, save a little violence and Fluffy (cover the kids eyes), this movie gets about as high and honor as I can offer.  Well done.
B000069CWE|5.0|On October 24th of the year 2000 Linkin Park blasted onto the music scene with the release of their, now over 8 times platinum, CD Hybrid Theory.  Hybrid Theory was one of the best albums I had ever heard and it stayed in my player for over a year.  With songs like One Step Closer, Crawling, In The End, Runaway, and my personal favorite A Place for My Head.    Linkin Park has achieved the perfect mixture of Rap beats and Hard Rock tunes.  Now, two years later, we have seen the release of Reanimation and I have to say that this album is possibly even better than Hybrid Theory.  Maybe its just these songs, some previously unreleased, taken to a new level and reworked to become the perfect culmination of Rap and Hard Rock.  I just don't know, but this album just seems to be better than Hybrid Theory.
6305878323|4.0|No doubt this is a fantastic movie. Ask anyone. But there's one thing about this production that makes me want to break the disc over my knee: Disney has encoded this disc so that every time you watch it, YOU ARE FORCED TO SIT THROUGH THE ...PREVIEWS!<br />The DVD standard allows the producer to prevent viewers from activating certain functions at certain times (to make a DVD-based game, for example, play according to the game rules). But, aside from the FBI warning segment, this is the first movie I've encountered that WON\\"T EVEN LET YOU STOP THE DISC during the previews. You can't press MENU to get to other features, and you can't press STOP. You're stuck, basically, with the temptation to press EJECT. Fortunately, the production engineers at Disney missed one trick; you can at least Fast Forward through the previews. This is a shade better than turning off the TV and waiting it out.<br />C'mon, Disney. This isn't a rental -- I bought your disc! And you make me sit through 5 minutes of previews for things that I either: own, or choose not to own (thank you very much). I understand Disney's desire to \\"cross sell\\" their new stuff based on their old stuff. And I don't mind watching previews, but -- every time I play the disc? Shame on you!!<br />After you've wasted five minutes, of your life, enjoy the movie. It's a treasure and I wish someone would make another like it. But not on a disc like this!
0385505833|4.0|This is a delightful little story and unfortunately, probably too true as it describes how hard it would be in this culture to just not celebrate Christmas.  Nothing too deep here and no legal intrigue but it's fun.  I was cheering for the main characters to make it through the season with no tree, no presents, no parties.  May try it myself one of these years.  The message in the ending (which I won't give away) is a valuable one.
B000007MVD|3.0|The Beatles' &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; is entirely in mono, and it sounds great in mono, because that was probably the way it was originally recorded. It gives it a sense of oldness.<BR>There are lots of dialogue tracks, which are also fun to listen to. It seems like a real Beatles radio show. The unreleased songs are good, although some of the recordings aren't great quality, but once again, it sounds better the way they really recorded it. It would have been horrible if they'd &quot;remixed&quot; and &quot;Remastered&quot; all the tracks into stereo, and beefed it all up, the way they ruined the Yellow Submarine tracks with the new Yellow Submarine 1999 album. <BR>The Beatles at the BBC is an essential Beatles album.
B000069CWE|5.0|The album itself is an interesting and conceptual idea - a disc full of remixed versions of songs already released. With the help of such artists as Jay Gordon, Aaron Lewis, Kutmasta Kurt, Black Thought, Kelli Ali, and many others, this album has carried on the tradition of amazingly meaningful lyrics and instrumental talent that always keeps the listener guessing. I went out and bought this cd today because I was curious and I am so astounded with it. The beginning of the cd starts out with a slow symphonic instrumental, (which caught my attention because it doesn't sound like typical Linkin Park)and then quickly morphs into new remix versions of &quot;Points of Authority&quot; and &quot;In the End.&quot; The entire cd seems to flow together and the craftmanship behind this cd is fantastic. Enjoy it!
B000069CWE|5.0|awesome new lyrics with other artists.  has new hip-hop edge to it.  great beats and sample effects.  more guitar emphasis along with great new drum beats as well.<BR>definitely 5 stars!
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. I guess I was about 10 or 11 when it came out, and it never left my tapeplayer. This is Smashing Pumpkins when they were at their best during the early 90's grunge era. It fits in with a long string of great albums that came out around that time. I've strayed away from some of the more recent pumpkins albums such as Adore and mellon collie as they seem to be lacking the pumpkins oringinal greatness. Forget whatever music category this album is lumped into like &quot;grunge&quot; or &quot;alternative rock&quot; it is simply great music. Corgan's singing and the pumpkins creativity and talent on this album are tops. I'd recommend this album to anyone who has an interest in music.
6304595247|4.0|Sure, there's a lot wrong with Peter Kosminky's 1992 take on the Emily Bronte classic. For starters, Binoche and Fiennes are both too old for their teenage parts in the first half of the film, and then Fiennes and Janet McTeer(as longtime and long suffering Earnshaw servant Nelly Dean) don't age nearly enough in the second. Even more of a problem is the stunt casting of Binoche - her occasional slight French accent is a trifle inexelicable here, as others have noted - as both Cathy and her honey blonde daughter, Catherine Linton, neither of whom ever left Yorkshire. The script makes some wacky changes, also - instead of Cathy and Heathcliff spying on a lavish ball at the Linton's, they watch Edgar and Isabella play a game of indoor badminton. (O-kaaaaaay....Linton, badminton...well, it sort of rhymes...)<BR> <BR>Instead of focusing on the minuses, I prefer to admire this adaptation's stong points. Unlike the mushy tho' oddly revered 1939 version (and the 1970 one with Timothy Dalton), it tells the entire story, which despite everyone's fond memories, isn't a romance so much as it is a revenge tale and one of the first complex psychological portaits of an abused boy becoming a brutal, abusive man. To that end, Ralph Fiennes is a note-perfect Heathcliff; the scene of his humilitation of Isabella is right on the money. (One feels that he'd eat Olivier's wimp of a Heathcliff for tea, after making him clean the stables three times over.) Despite her miscasting, Binoche makes a lovely, haunting Cathy in the first half and a sympathetic pawn in Heathcliff's twisted plan in the second. Add to that fine support from McTeer, Simon Shepherd (Edgar Linton), Sophie Ward (Isabella) and a young Jeremy Northam (Hindley); heck, even Sinead O'Connor, with her eyes as wide as saucers, catches the right Bronte groove as narrator Emily herself. (What would O'Connor have been like as Cathy, one wonders...) Again, unlike the 1939 flick, Kosminsky sets the story in its proper time period (1770s - very early 1800s), with superb costumes and production values. Authentic Yorkshire moors and other locations add to the tragedy's flavour. The frosting on the cake, though, is Ryuichi Sakamoto's shattering score, which conveys the story's haunting wildness in one swelling phrase almost better than the entire film does itself. (Pity that - like the movie - it was never released in the U.S.; there's a suite arrangement on Sakamoto's CINEMAGE album that merely leaves you wanting the whole score, available only as a rare and pricey import from Japan.) Perhaps a DVD edition, if ever produced, will contain the score, as well as scenes chopped from the truncated print run on Bravo. Until a better version comes along (the 1998 MASTERPIECE THEATRE one with Orla Brady and Robert Cavanah had a few great gothic bits - Heathcliff digging up and sobbingly embracing Cathy's bones really hit the core of the tale), the Fiennes and Binoche take will remain my favourite visit to WUTHERING HEIGHTS. It's a bumpy ride all right, but well worth the trip.
0805066691|5.0|Americans have always studied the American Indian from a viewpoint looking Westward -- this is a book that looks at them, looking Eastward. New perspectives (at least new when the book was published in 1970) and shocking statistics changed our view of Indian-White relations in the 19th Century. Characters speak for themselves in quotes from Presidents, Chiefs, generals, braves and cavalry troops.<br />In one chapter the reader is invited to a Cheyenne winter camp to observe their preparation for the hard season. Then, before dawn the next morning, we are led to watch in horror as Lt. Col. George Custer leads a cavalry charge on the village. Of course there is nothing here of the actions that prompted such malevolent response, but that would not serve the purpose of the book. For the purpose of this book is totally one-sided -- to portray one side of the American Indian experience and to cast them in a much more sympathetic light had been done in previous writings. The book is pure, narrowly-focused historic revisionism with no pretense toward balance.<br />All that said, it's a valuable book because for us to understand our heritage, we need to know about and be sympathetic to, the truth of our history, whether it strikes us as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; What looks bad to us in the 21st Century may not have looked that way to us had we lived in the 19th and known only what they knew.<br />This book gives us some of the truth and it should be read and appreciated for what it is rather than lauded as the final word on Indian-White political relations. Let's hope that someday someone will have the courage to write &quot;the other side of the story.&quot; And, folks, there IS another side that is equally poignant and equally valuable.

B00005YW4H|5.0|This is my favority album of the year. I'm a Sarah McLachlan fan but now can't wait for Norah's to release a new album. Jazz purists don't like her because she's not &quot;pure&quot; enough for them. So... if your a jazz purist, skip it. For the other 98% of you, you will love it. I have already given 5 cds to my friends, all of whom say they can't stop playing it, it's the only cd they listen to (so buy extra now to save the shipping costs).
B00001OH7O|4.0|In the void before Bowie became the famous Ziggy Stardust, he was basically a singer/songwriter, not out to blow you away but to entertain. And this album is certainly entertaining, probably about as any folk, pop/rock record I own. Bowie was into his 'musical chameleon' stages by then but seems quite comfortable in the state he's in.<br />The record kicks off with the famous 'Changes', one of Bowie's most known songs. It's probably all that much more ironic coming from Bowie himself as nobody had a clue how many he would go through in the near future at the time. The song can take on a new meaning for each individual who hears it. The album lives up to Bowie's history of being in various styles at once as we're hit with some anthemic rocking of 'Oh You Pretty Things' and 'Life on Mars' to the folky 'Song for Bob Dylan' and 'Andy Warhol'. The best part is that Bowie puts all these differing styles of songs together and you never feel out of place jumping from one to the other. Probably would serve as a good starting point for a Bowie 'newbie' and if you're a fan of his you won't be dissapointed in the least.
B000069HKH|5.0|I haven't bought a CD the minute it went on sale in years. After reading the various interviews with Bruce, I knew I had to get out and get this new and wondrous work. Hearing it, I feel as if it is Sept 11th all over again. I feel the pain, the confusion and I feel the haunting loss. My heart breaks again for the 3,000 human beings no longer walking this earth. And for their loved ones . . .<br />And yet there is so much joy and healing on this CD.  Bruce takes us to the sorrow and shows us his version, and then he takes us to the healing that is one block down the road.<br />God Bless this wonderful artist.<br />It is so good to have his artistry and humanity back.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I think you can sum this record up to the phrase 'you don't know what you're missing'. A stunning record sure to grow in mystique in the future, Sigur Ros has brought us something totally familiar, yet strikingly new.<br />To call the music atmospheric is an understatement; this music flows and soars, bringing the listner with it. Mixed with the music are some haunting vocals, sung in native Icelandic, that match the music perfectly. It doesn't matter that you don't understand what they're saying because the vocals act as another, and here vital, instrument to take the awesome music to the next level. Each track builds on itself and by the end you're sold on it even though you don't know why.<br />It may take a listen or 5 to really grasp what Sigur Ros is offering, but the effort has vast rewards. It may not be for everyone, but that's hoping for too much. Any fan of more orchestral, experimental, or 'space' rock will absolutely adore this, as will fans of Radiohead, Bjork, or similar artists.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This clever comedy makes you laugh, warms your heart, and brings a huge smile to your face when it's over.  It pleasantly surprises you with its smart humor.

Here Bob invoked the angst of the 60's and turned it<BR>on its head.  sarcasm, and myth; the title alone brings to mind<BR>Robert Johnson, and the Crossroads.

B000069CWE|4.0|This is an overall good cd. Imagine Hybrid Theory with more rap than rock. There is still a Linkin Park influence in each song, but most of them are remixed into rap. I liked the cd overall but i was hoping the songs would be more techno like the Points of Authority remix by Jay Gordon. Good CD though, well worth the money
0316666343|3.0|I admit the book was haunting, and it has left an impression that is still lingering 3 days later, but I also don't think that it lived up to the hype.  But more specifically, I had the impression, time and again as I was reading it, that the book was somewhat scattered.  It was as if tiny portions of themes never developed, or perhaps edited out, were excised in a sloppy sort of way, leaving half developed thoughts and characters dangling.  If I could ask the author one nagging question, in particular, it would be this:  What did Mrs. Singh mean when she said of Ruth &quot;I will start with her&quot; (something along those lines, anyway).  It's as if a story that never went anywhere, or a piece of character development that was excised was done in an incomplete way.  Or am I missing something?<br />A good book, but not the earth-shaking masterpiece that some would have you believe.
B00005A46T|3.0|Like their previous release, Slipknot relies on unimaginative overdone speed riffs and screaming to sell records, it just becomes so boring.  At times though the band shows its ability to write some very clever songs, like &quot;Left Behind Full&quot;, just really really clever, but its so drowned out by yelling and monotonous playing that its almost not worth listening to.  Almost that is.  Other really good songs, Everything Ends, which has some really cool riffs, but same story, just drowned out by really unimaginitive playing.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is a great cd full of hard songs, which i love. the only thing wrong with it is that 2 of their songs are not really songs i'll tell you what that means in my song ratings......<BR>1 the Grudge- very hard, very long(over 9 mins) great way to start the cd 5/5<BR>2 Eon Blue Apocalypse- slower and short, but a good song 4/5<BR>3 the Patient- starts slow but gets very hard, fairly long (about 8 mins) 4/5<BR>4 Mantra- very dumb, it's just the sound of a whale for 2 mins 1/5<BR>5 Schism- this song is just great, all i can say is it ROCKS 5/5<BR>6 Parabol- soft and short, it goes right into Parabola, if you think of it as an intro to Paraboloa it's great 4/5<BR>7 Parabola- this song is so good, very hard and very awesome, words can't tell how good it is 5/5<BR>8 Ticks &amp; Leeches- great song very hard and a great chorus (over 8 mins) 5/5<BR>9 Lateralis- starts slow but gets really heavy, such a great song 5/5<BR>10 Disposition- hard and long, but still an awesome song (over 9 mins) 4/5<BR>11 Reflection- Hard and GREAT, really cool (over 10 mins) 5/5<BR>12 Triad- short and hard, no words in the song, gets you pumped up 5/5<BR>13 Faaip De Oiad- all this song is, is static with a guy talking about UFO's, very strange 1/5
B00005OAIE|5.0|I've never felt so much connection with anyone's lyrics as I do with this album.  As catchy as &quot;No Such Thing&quot; is on the radio, it does not begin to describe the depth of the rest of the album both musically and lyrically.  The intro to &quot;3x5&quot; alone is worth buying this album for.  I can see where comparisons to DMB come from, but John Mayer is his own powerhouse.  His songs speak to me and for me, and I can't stop listening to this album.
B00004XONN|4.0|My first reaction to this album was something along the lines of, &quot;What the heck am i listening to?&quot; I want to say, first of all, that optimistic is nothing like the rest of the album. However, once you get over the shock, this album is simply incredible. It begins with synths and voice warps making up the first 2 tracks. The title track has almost a jazz beat to it. There are also the self-driven rock sounds of the national anthem and optimistic. how to dissapear completely is a nice acoustic/strings song. i never listen to morning bell because i can't follow the rythym. basically, this is the most experimental album i've ever heard.<br />-( e [) /-\ z<BR>by the way, the first song from vanilla sky is on this album, so you have an idea what the album sounds like.
B000069CWE|5.0|I wanted 'REANIMATION' so bad, my dad and I went out on the 29th to see if anyone had it out.  On July 30th my dad got the last 'REANIMATION' in the store!  (It was the display case one!) Trust me. It's worth it.  It is way different than Hybrid Theory (Their old C.D.)  Also 'REANIMATION' has multi media value.  Just pop it into your P.C.!  There is 20 songs so it is really a good value.  Just a warning: NOTHING sounds the same.
B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park has done it again, but not alone this time.  They've remixed all of Hybrid Theory plus a few other songs they did to make the ultimate remix album.  They're not doing weak dance remixes or just changing a few effects, these are almost new songs.  Same beat and sometimes same chorus, but there are a lot of new verses and rhymes.  Very good too.  Other artists assited in the remixes and even added their own verses and rhymes.  If you liked Hybrid Theory you'll love this.  And there's no swearing, so don't worry about your parents getting mad.
B00005K3LW|4.0|This second sequel to the immensely popular Die Hard is a bit different this time around.  Instead of an enclosed location, this one spans all of New York City (making it a good, and far more thrilling, alternative to tourism), as Lt. John McClane and streetwise shopowner Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) have to race around the Big Apple at the whim of a mad bomber's (Jeremy Irons) demands.<br />This third-go-round for NYPD cop John McClane is the best of the series (and actually seems to negate Die Hard 2 considering he was LAPD in that picture), not only because it's more clever and thrilling than its predecessors, but because of director John Mctiernan's ingeniouse use of locales to build excitement and suspense.  The film uses inventive methods of making the locations add to the flavor, and doubles the effectiveness by adding the street-smart savvy of both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, whose knowledge of the city works like a charm both in terms of the plot and the film's entertainment value.  <br />Speaking of Willis and Jackson, DHWV is played as a buddy show, and the chemistry between the two is simply excellent, easily equalling anything Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have worked on together.  Jackson, as a new addition to the series, plays a near-racist black man who initially dislikes McClane, but eventually becomes friends with. Willis' and Jackson's verbal spars strike up some big laughs, and better yet, you actually care about their fates, not only as to whether or not they're going to live through the situation, but the fact that you hope they'll get past their differences and end up as best buddies.  Sure, it's all predictable, but it's all played out with so much fun, you don't even really care.  Also worth mentioning among the cast is a German-accented Jeremy Irons as the bomber, this being his last truly excellent villainous performance before he'd go on to embarrass himself in Dungeons and Dragons.<br />The action's great and non-stop, with the expected explosions, shootouts, and fist fights, as well as several superb car chases, including a drive through a park and a tidal wave of water in a tunnel that need to be seen to be believed.  Getting a breather is a little unlikely, but it's nice to see a film that manages to develop its lead characters nicely in the midst of so much action.  If the film disappoints in any aspect, it's with several leaps of logic in the plot (they're very noticeable, too) and the conclusion, which feels pretty limp in comparison to all the exciting material that came before it.  Still, that's only about five minutes out of a two-hour thrill ride that engages the nerves and the brain.
B000069CWE|1.0|This CD is a big disapointment to me. This is a bunch of remixed songs from there first cd, that sound terrible! I love the songs the way they were, this makes them sound terrible! The only good song  I was waiting for &quot;My December&quot; they made sound worse than the DVD. If you are looking for new LInkin Park, this is not it!<br />I played the first one 100 times, and I will not play this one again!!<br />Do not waste your money!
B000069HKH|5.0|It's rare in today's rock world where the music matters little and the 'stars' are just celebraties, when an album comes out that matters and means something.  This album comes at a time when the US needed a reassuring shot in the arm and rock needed an album that mattered.  Bruce gives us both.  <br />The song writing, as always, is top notch.  The sound of the album is incredible.  To paraphrase, 'This is not your father's E-Street Band.'  They sound more contemporary than bands half their age.<br />Lonesome Day, The Rising, My City of Ruin are all great songs.  Mary's Place is throw back to the Wild and Innocent Days.  This album is a balm to Springsteen fans - a few party songs, meaningful lyrics and a spirited studio performance (which he really truely hasn't had since Born in the USA).<br />Oddly enough however, the musical foil for Mr. Springsteen is not the Big Man or Little Steven but Soozie Tyrell on violin.  She plays on most songs and adds a very unique coloring and shading to the songs.  She is a welcomed addition to the mix and it's surprising.  Bruce could have relied on a big sax solo here, a Little Steven guitar lick there but the use of the violen surprises us and keeps the music fresh.<br />Will this stand next to the holy grail of Springsteen (Born to Run>Darkenss>River>USA), it's hard to say.  Will it stand as a great achievement and a great record - you betcha.<br />Buy it - dance to it - listen to it - rock out to a great songwriter, a great rock singer, a great rock band and remember why rock used to matter and hope that it can matter again.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Who would argue with this one? Some people would, but of course we still love it. It has some missing parts, but they have included more things into it, than it has in the books. I would love everyone to buy this DVD, while it's out. And also.. the 2nd movie is coming out, who would want to miss it? No one would, it's fantastic, so I say, see this and be amazed.. everyone would want to see a magical world.. of Harry Potter.
B000069HKH|5.0|Every time Bruce puts out a new album (which isn't often enogh for fans!), its an event.  What always amazes me is how good these records are, and how he constantly challanges himself as an musician, and us as his audience.  The Rising is no exception.  Bruce has put forth a collection of songs that actually work better when taken as a whole than individually.  Not to say that each individual song isn't great, because they are, but this is an album which needs to be listened to without interuption.  Bring on the tour!
B000069CWE|5.0|When I heard the four preview songs on the offical Linkin Park website, I was thinking 'Woah...this CD is gonna be cool.'  But when I got the CD a couple of hours ago, I became 'Linkin Park is now officially the best band in the world.'  This is a really cool CD for Linkin Park fans...I highly recommend it.  To me...it's as good as \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"  Linkin Park did it again!  Can't wait for the next album!
B00004XOLZ|5.0|the lyrics and the intensity of their delivery are incredible.  verging on the bathetic the album skims aloft to the sublime.  images of extreme angst and joy.  i loved this album and listened to it constantly for weeks and when i heard it playing in a bar i was mesmerized all over again.  antony's singing voice is a sort of alto falsetto that morphs the lyrics' meanings into other dimensions and one can't be sure from what depths their message springs.  the instrumentation is unique and well played with cellos, violins, piano in sometimes, it appears, deliberately kitchy yet sophisticated orchestrations.  the lyrics are well crafted and full of startling images.  i highly recommend this album as a unique and well crafted work.
B000069CWE|5.0|alrighty kids this linkin park cd is a great follow up to hybrid theory it has nice beats and some new songs.the best part about it is that if you like the first cd how can you not like a cd that is just remixed which sounds amazing to me anyways and has some new songs
B000069HKH|4.0|After one listen to the Rising, I could only think damn this is a really good album.  After a day of listening, I thought damn this is a GREAT album (definite Grammy nomination here).  If you are a Springsteen fan, this is the closest you are going to get to the Born in the USA days.  It is a mature rock album by a mature songwriter (yes lots of songs rock, but also lots of mellow tunes).  Lyrically, inspiration from 9/11 is throughout the entire album, and if anyone was going to write about the tragic events, Bruce is the one to do it (and probably one of the only ones I'd respect doing it).  I'm already singing along to the songs as I drive down the highway, they are infectious.  The first 3 songs really set the tone, each one is exceptional, and just fine songcrafting.  The production is top notch, and the musicians are at their finest.  I can only say, that if you have been craving Bruce to play some rock again, this is it.  It is'nt rock like his earlier stuff, but c'mon, he is a mature artist, and this is just what I would expect, and just what I needed.
B000001E18|2.0|This is definitely not U2's best album. This was recorded in a matter of a few weeks, and it shows. Only a couple songs: the title track, &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay for your Crashed Car&quot; and &quot;Babyface&quot; can be classified as good -- &quot;Daddy's...&quot; being the only one out of those that can be called excellent. The rest of the songs are pretty mediocre.<br />U2 displays here that they are at their best when they take their time in the studio and make us wait awhile before their next album. Their next two albums, Pop and All You Can Leave Behind are much better, and both were about four years apart in time from each other and Pop released nearly four years after this album. U2 should stick to that formula; it works better for them.
B000000OAN|5.0|This is it.  Queen did everything right on this, their best and consummate album.  The musical range of the four band members is almost beyond belief; each song differs entirely from the one before it.  Layers upon layers of vocal and instrumental tracks make A Night At the Opera an orchestral experience.  This is not just glam rock, nor is it completely metal, or hard rock, or even rock, for that matter.  Some people call it &quot;art rock.&quot;  I'm not so sure about the connotations of that term, but I am positive that this album IS a work of art!
B000069HKH|5.0|This is a spectacular album! Bruce has really captured the essence of the American spirit this time around. It's not about wearing flags on your lapels or singing jingoistic songs. There's nothing wrong with that but Bruce goes deeper and beyond the flag waving and the chest thumping that followed 9/11 to write about what it feels like to lose a loved one. Songs like The heart-wrenching \\"You're Missing\\" and the haunting \\"Empty Sky\\" put all of the emotions people have been feeling in a way that wearing a flag pin never can. Meanwhile \\"Into the Fire\\" is the most beautiful and eloquent homage to the firefighters and policeman that disappeared into the flaming towers that morning. \\"Mary's Place\\" is classic Bruce and classic E-Street band with everybody jamming and singing their hearts out.<br />When I was a kid Bruce changed my life with rock and roll and this time around I think he's going to heal and mend lot of broken hearts with his music. If you're a fan, you know what I'm talking about, if you're not, here's your chance to finally see what the fuss is all about.
B000000OAH|3.0|Jazz is punctuated by both high and low points.  Among the best moments are Brian May's &quot;Fat-Bottomed Girls&quot;  (chauvinist perhaps, but undeniably catchy), &quot;Dreamer's Ball,&quot;  and Freddie's &quot;Don't Stop Me Now.&quot;  &quot;Dead on Time&quot;  has a killer riff.  The rest of the songs hit and miss. Some work but wreak of vanilla  (&quot;Jealousy,&quot;  &quot;Leavin' Home Ain't Easy,&quot;  &quot;In Only Seven Days&quot;).  Others are markedly strange but add flavor  (&quot;Bicycle Race,&quot;  &quot;Mustapha,&quot; &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;).  Still others fall completely flat  (&quot;If You Can't Beat Them,&quot;  &quot;Fun It,&quot;  &quot;More of that Jazz&quot;).  Queen is showing signs of burnout at this point after extensive touring and recording and seem bored with their own brand of theatrical rock.  Notably, this is the last of the &quot;no synths&quot; albums; sadly, Jazz foreshadows the worst of Queen which--with the exception of two number one singles in 1980--was soon to come.
B000066NW0|4.0|I got this CD on a fluke.  I like to go out on a limb to find new music and was impressed by what this teenager had to say.  It is great rock music with meaning you'll never get from Britney or Christina.  However, there is plenty of room for improvement, and provide she isn't a one hit wonder, I am sure we will see it.<br />The only thing I find a bit disturbing is the lyrics.  While I appreciate the depth of them, the subject matter seems a bit much to be coming from someone still in high school...
B000000OAA|5.0|At this point in Queen's career, it was all starting to come together.  Though the songwriting is not as up to par as it would be on the next three albums, Sheer Heart Attack ranks among Queen's best.  &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;  has one of the most impressive guitar solos ever recorded; it is vintage Brian May.  &quot;Killer Queen&quot;  was the band's first bonafied hit  (number 12 in the U.K.), and &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; is rapid-fire fun  (later covered by Metallica).  &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot;  is a zany hodge-podge of vaudeville, boogie-woogie, and rag.  &quot;Now I'm Here&quot; worked especially well in live performances.  The album is a bit disjointed at times--&quot;Misfire,&quot;  &quot;She Makes Me&quot;--but the emergence of Queen as the ground-breaking force it would become is clearly evident.
B000001FS3|5.0|This album is U2.  Anyone who likes U2 now, i.e. All That You Can't Leave Behind, should listen to this album.  The Joshua Tree is essential U2 and All That You Can't Leave Behind is just a mirror image.  I think every song is great and on the whole the album spans a variety of moods and tempos.  The one thing that ties it all together is the writing.  U2 have always been a great lyrical group but songs like Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found, Exit, and Mothers of the Disappeared hilight the range possible by this group.  I find it most enjoyable that each song is a metaphor that can often be interpretted in multiple ways even if the group didn't intend it that way.  They also continue their political involvement with great songs like Bullet the Blue Sky (though the live versions are better, e.g. Rattle and Hum version).<br />All in all, I don't think any fan of U2 could be disappointed in this album.
B000000OAC|5.0|Tracks one and two speak for themselves.  &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;  will blow you away.  &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot;  is a gem of a song; I actually cried the first time I heard it!  &quot;Who Needs You&quot;  sports some fancy Latin-ish rhythms and guitar work, and &quot;It's Late&quot; is an epic of a ballad-turned-power-rocker.  &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; is tasteless, but the closing title, &quot;My Melancholy Blues,&quot;  more than makes up for it.  The latter could have come from a Broadway show or from the lounge scene of some movie from Hollywood's golden era.  The piano solo is terrific.  All in all, another Queen staple.  After 1977 it seems that, musically, not even Queen could top themselves.  This is the last flawless album they managed to produce.
B00000DFSK|4.0|Ok, well as a die hard U2 fan I am disappointed in this CD.  I probably wouldn't of bought it except I got the addition with the B-Sides.  The B-Sides alone would be a 5 Star disc.<br />However, I realize that greatest hits are typically targetted at the casual fan who doesn't own any material and wants all the \\"hits\\".  In this case the CD delivers.  It includes the single versions of all their singles.<br />My complaint as a U2 fan is that it isn't necessarily all their greatest songs.  This album should of been titled \\"Singles 1980 - 1990\\" instead of best of.  Songs that I could of been on this cd, their best: \\"40\\", One Tree Hill (included on some import versions), A Sort of Homecoming, and Tomorrow.  October is a nice addition at the end and they probably could of left off Angel of Harlem.  Last of all, I am greatly disappointed in the version of Where the Streets Have No Name which is a single version without the dramatic intro that makes it my favorite song of all time.
B000000OAL|4.0|Not the best Queen album, nor is it the worst.  &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;  remains a classic, and the scope of &quot;Liar&quot;  can still impress.  &quot;Son and Daughter&quot;  has a good, grinding riff.  One thing that sets this debut album apart from Queen's subsequent work is the lyrical depth.  Queen never tried to change the world with profundity of lyric, but it's hard to ignore the poetic qualities of &quot;Doing All Right&quot;  and  &quot;The Night Comes Down.&quot;  And, for a riddle, try deciphering Freddie's cryptic &quot;Great King Rat&quot;  and &quot;My Fairy King.&quot;  In the end, an impressive debut effort with vision; good things were definately on the horizon.
B000001DTM|5.0|Ok, well this is the album that started it all for me.  I mostly bought it because at the time it seemed so advanced from the mainstream of what was popular music in 1992.  I am a fan of music that extends the bounds of rock music, and this album did it.  The combination of lyrics and the music make this a superb album.  It was hard for me to believe this was the same group that made &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;.  Yet, 10 years later, it is hard for me to tell the difference.  Part of what has made U2 great is their progress.  Achtung Baby was the start of the progress.  Some of the greatest songs on this album in that regard are those that never made it as singles.  My favorite is Ultraviolet.  The Fly is another great one, but was probably too out there when it came out.  Until the End of the World is the 3rd gem.<br />This album and the accompanying Zoo TV tour were supposedly where U2 made fun of what they became and their &quot;selling out&quot; with Rattle and Hum.  Yet, lyrically, they only improved upon the Joshua Tree as the words are much deeper than their literal meanings.<br />Now to conclude it... This is a great album but probably not for everyone.  If you are one of those early U2 fans and not into more electronic / distorted music / 90's alternative, then this album may not be for you.  At the same time, I find it difficult to understand how anyone who is a big U2 fan could not like this album.  Even when I found it weird, it grew on me and is still one of my 10 favorite albums.
B00005JL3A|4.0|First off, you should realize just by the title that this is a popcorn flick.  It focuses on horror, suspense, gore, big guns, and the occassional naked Jojovich.  I watched this movie on a whim, expecting it to be horrible drek.  After all, it's based on a computer game (which I've never played) and the previews were AWFUL.  However, against all odds, I found myself absolutely LOVING this movie.  Great beginning, great suspense, great pacing, great soundtrack, and a great ending that keeps on giving you more just when you're afraid it's over.  Let's put it this way: I have a little under 200 movies in my collection, and this has just become one of my favorites.  This is not intellectual or deeply moving -- but it is fun as heck.
B00005JKQX|2.0|O.K. I know this is a \\"good\\" movie with good actors and perfect little sets. But, I have to say, the day people start realizing that those characteristics aren't quite enough is the day I'll stop complaining. How is it that people can not see behind the ease of this movie and realize it is excrutiatingly dull and not well thought out? I'd much rather watch a documentary of the life of John Nash than sit through a movie that rushes along just to hit all the \\"right\\" moments. It's called editing - a concept Ron Howard missed on this one.<br /><br />The thing I don't like about these over-done Hollywood movies is that everything is just so in place and \\"right.\\" In order to accurately portray a real life and get people involved in a visceral, intense way is to cut out all the sugar coating and drop huge doses of the heavy sickening reality we all live in. I'm not saying everything in film must be disturbing and cynical. What I'm saying is that film-makers should try to push the envelope and force us to see life in all its glory and all its sadness. This film pretends to be concerned with showing us a hard but glorious life, but fails because it doesn't dig deep enough-it doesn't just throw it all up. It carefully, politely sort of asks us to consider it and this is what I call a weak story and a weak film.<br /><br /> If you want to watch movies about people struggling, go watch Happiness or Bully or American Movie. Don't listen to the hype. This movie is dull, sometimes embarrassing, unrealistic (and yes, I know that John Nash existed and approved of this film) and not an ounce of innovation was felt. Please, everyone start thinking for yourself. Stop believing that slick, perfect movies are great pieces of art. Go watch something raw, something that can laugh at itself like Sleepaway Camp.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Everything about this movie and DVD is great.  This is one of the few rare sequels that is BETTER than the original.  I own the normal Terminator 2 DVD and it is a drink coaster in comparism to this DVD.  If only all DVDs had this much effort put into them.  Then they would really be worth the price we pay for them.
B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising is one of the best collections of up lifting songs since Darkness on the Edge of Town.  Bruce and the E Street band explore some different musical areas to create a sound that is inventive yet very much the Boss.  Don't think that this is a down trodden album because it is not even close.  Tracks like &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot; and &quot;Lets Be Friends (Skin to Skin)&quot; will have you pondering taking the day off work.<br />This album has been dubbed a &quot;9/11&quot; album and while many of the songs are applicable, the themes can be carried on through many levels.  Musically and spiritually, Bruce and the E Street Band has stepped up to the plate to save us. Like Bono said in Bruce's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, &quot;He's not the Boss, he works for us&quot;.  Bruce has proven this once again.
B00003Q438|5.0|All DVDs should be made as this one.  James Cameron has brought us so many great films and this is one of them.  This movie has one of the best punches captured on film when The Hammer knocks Michael Bein on his [rear] when he is attempting to choke Ed Harris with a chain.<br />Definately get this DVD over all other versions!

B00005QG9J|4.0|No its not a Napa Cabernet! Its this incredible collection of music from a band I somehow just discovered this month! On a whim I downloaded a few MP3s to check out (and YES I bought the albums here on Amazon so dont send the men in black to my front door) and I was simply knocked [down]. From heavy riffs ala Rage/System, to sophisticated melodies and vocal harmonies to a funky, scratchy melange of Beastie-like undertones to even a bit of the controlled noise of Radiohead, Incubus has depth that so many wanna-bes would give their nose rings for. <br />Okay, I know a lot of you empty vee kids and sk8rs will write this one off as too mellow, but anyone who has any understanding of the artistic process and has listened to their previous efforts can get where these guys are at. As a big Chili Peppers and Foo fan I listened to this album and really felt like I was hearing a group of musicians that were ready to assume the role as torch bearer for this ever-evolving punk/funk/grunge genre. Allow them their experimentation with strings, the slower tempos and more introspective lyrical tendencies, but dont write them off as sell offs. Their intent, authenticity and sincerity to make music that accurately captures where they are collectively and personally at right now cannot be questioned, period. What I love about their music is JUST when you think its melodies or rhythmic patterns are approaching predictable they throw sumpin at you that makes you think and feels original.<br />I've been listening to practically nothing but this disc for the past week and it gets my vote for best rock album -- hands down. For those of you who love Chili Peppers or any other band with a groove behind the noise give this one a serious listen.
6301963717|5.0|The Coen Brothers true triumph; their style blends perfectly with the gangster genre.  This movie has an incredibly thought provoking plot that isn't out to trick or confuse but keeps you wondering nonetheless.  It is wonderfully acted, especially Gabriel Byrne, John Turturro, Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, and Jon Polito.  The look, the feel, and the LANGUAGE of the movie relentlessly reinforce the story.  Stop reading this and buy it, or at least rent it, then buy it.
B000069HKH|5.0|You know what?    You probably won't know what to make of this album the first time you listen to it. Bruce isn't really breaking new ground, but ... it's definitely different. My first thought was .. why so much repetition in the verses?  Why include fun, bouncy songs amid the darkness?  <br />I listened again. I smiled. After reading some interviews he'd done, I knew what he was attempting to do.  The reason for the repetition is that .. these are, essentially, hymns.  It's the same call and response delivery that preachers use.   In other words, to drive home a point .. a FEELING.. you want to almost invoke a kind of meditative state.  The subject matter has its footing in the 9/11 tragedy, but it's not an album ABOUT 9/11.  It's simply that .. he's a songwriter and .. he felt a duty to describe the emotion that was/is in the air.   He was moved to write by a fan who pulled up alongside him, saying .. &quot;We need you NOW&quot;.  What followed just poured out from his soul...<br />The songs?  It's good stuff.  From the blues of &quot;Empty Sky&quot; to the wonderful &quot;Paradise&quot;, he covers every emotion here. I like the melody of &quot;Nothing Man&quot;, the church choir of &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; and .. well.. all of it.  The funny thing is, probably my favorite track is the most lightweight of them all - &quot;Let's Be Friends&quot;.   It might have been a &quot;throwaway&quot; on an earlier Springsteen album, but.. it's needed here.   The fun songs are melodic medicine to help bring you to that &quot;sunny day&quot;.  <br />There is a definite spiritual aura to these songs.  Bruce has been &quot;playing&quot; at the preacher role in recent concerts, but I think he now realizes that he is one of the few - the absolute few - who has earned our trust. We believe in his message.  He has always been about hope and inspiration, but... this is the first time he's literally trying to help us rise up.<br />We don't need to hear about the cool Romeos and the Tom Joads. We need to believe again - to find the strength to do all the little things: to travel, to hope, to love.  I was one of the fans praying for a return to the &quot;early music&quot; of '73-'75 - a romantic period with some of the most beautiful poetry.  That, or .. I was hoping for a return to &quot;Nebraska&quot; - an underrated gem of a record. I lost track of the fact that .. Bruce is 52yrs old.  He's a grown man with a family, with children.  His catalog is a cycle of life - from the romantic street poet to the brooding young man, from folk poet to rock superstar.  Finally, he's now become one of a small, rarified group of spokesmen ... not for a &quot;generation&quot;, but for all of us.  He's been writing songs the past decade that chronicle those hiding in the shadows, hurt - the poor in Tom Joad, the AIDS patient in Philadelphia and now ... those we just can't afford to turn a blind eye to - our next door neighbor who might be feeling a tremendous about of grief over the loss of a loved one or .. a man who is tired of hearing how &quot;brave&quot; he was (&quot;Nothing Man&quot;) and has to struggle, nightly, with guilt and a temptation to end it all - to quiet the noise.  <br />It's a wake up call.  He's always championed the common man - the hero in us all.  <br />The fascinating thing about Springsteen is that .. he rescued rock from disco in the mid 70's. He brought integrity back to rock in the glitsy 80's.  Now.. at a time when we're all just trying to find something positive to latch onto - some kind of hope, here comes Bruce again with an album of hymns to fire up that choir, help exorcise our demons and get us to rise again.<br />Welcome back, friend... and.. thanks.<br />I can't wait for the revival to come to town. &quot;Turn it up..&quot;
B000001F75|5.0|This is really good cd with excellent cuts such The Rocker( hard rock classic)..of course their biggest hit in uk whiskey in the jar..it also has slow blues(blusey)..randolph's tango, little girl in bloom, gonna creep on you, and mamma nature said. It does have a couple of lesser songs..black boys on the corner and the last song but doesn't detract from the cd anyway.
0609610570|5.0|Execution is a great book!  It is a must read for anyone serious about business.  The authors define execution as follows \\"Execution is a systematic process of rigorously discussing the hows and whats, questioning, tenaciously following through and ensuring accountability.\\"<br />Execution provides a systematic framework for making sure strategy and execution go hand in hand to get results.  The authors describe the three core processes that make up execution as the people process, the strategy process, and the operations process.  Unless there is alignment in these processes there will not be effective execution.  The book goes into a great level of detail on each of these processes and Larry Bossidy provides some great examples of how these processes work at GE and Honeywell.<br />To prove their case the authors show a couple of very high profile execution success and failures.  In light of many high level business failures recently it seems clear that these companies did not have a culture of execution nor were their top executives involved in how the company actually ran.<br />The bottom line is that execution is a great book with great advice on getting things done and establishing accountability for results.  Buy this book!
0553381709|5.0|There are not many new fantasy novels out there that truly move me.  But, when you read Martin and become depressed at what happens in the book (Red Wedding), that says a lot about a book.  Martin truly belongs in the big leagues of fantasy novelists....And hopefully, like some other reviewers have stated, not become another rudderless Jordan, enjoying, the swells of money...
B000024D4R|5.0|I have always thought The Wall was one of Pink Floyd's most overrated albums. Funny that I think their previous offering, Animals, is their most underrated. Perhaps the fact, with the exception of the opening and closing acoustic numbers (&quot;Pigs on the Wing Part 1 &amp; 2&quot;), none of the songs are under 10 minutes long, and are better appreciated by prog rock fans used to 10+ minute long epics, which this album is almost entirely comprised of. While Roger Waters was tightening up control of the band by this point, it hasn't yet ruined the band, and it still sounds like a band effort here. I remembered when I was young, I was trying to understand what the meaning of Pigs, Dogs, and Sheep was all about, why would such a band be writting songs about barnyard animals. Until I found about about George Orwell and his second best known work (after 1984) called Animal Farm, and now the lyrics to the album makes perfect sense. The &quot;sheep&quot; are mindlessly obediant followers, the &quot;pigs&quot; are the thought police, and the &quot;dogs&quot; are power-mad violent manipulators. So the album is basically taking a slap at the predatory &quot;dog eat dog&quot; capitalist system. Now back to the music, Pink Floyd's role in the progressive rock scene has always been in question, but make no doubt the impact they made in that scene (such little known bands like Hawkwind, Porcupine Tree, Eloy, Pulsar, and many more owe to the likes of Pink Floyd), but I have to say Pink Floyd was progressive and Animals is essentially the last album in that style, as songs like &quot;Dogs&quot;, &quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot;, and &quot;Sheep&quot; clearly demonstrate. &quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot; also takes a swipe at Mary Whitehouse, but since I live in America, I know little of her, but she's supposedly the mid 1970s, British equivalent of Tipper Gore, more or less. &quot;Sheep&quot; is definately one of my favorites because I heard this long before getting Animals thanks to my dad owning their A Collection of Great Dance Songs compilation album. This is their only post-Dark Side of the Moon album in the 1970s where there were no radio hits, but that never bothers me, in fact, that's the reason why I like it so much, because no songs on this album had been ran in the dirt by radio airplay. Animals is to me Pink Floyd's last great album, and if you're a fan, get this album.
B000002H38|5.0|I just ordered this CD to add to my collection.  I have the LP, but no player.<br />I had work to do in my home office last evening...needless to say I could not work for singing WITH Anita every song on what I consider the BEST album she's ever made.<br />Every song sounds like a woman who walks and lives in love...yes, she experiences the joys and woes of being in love, but her elegant tones and vocal inflections say \\"I'm in love...venerable...sometimes hurt...disappointed...but then...overjoyed and raptured.\\"
B00005TT77|1.0|The most dishonor any person or band can do to The Beatles is play cover songs.  If the great Jimi Hendrix, with his superb talent, falls short then no one can do it... well... Joe Cocker did a good version of With a Little Help From My Friends during Woodstock... but this sound track is horrid.  This CD can be only one thing... It is the sound track to my own personal hell.
B00000634J|5.0|This is a must CD for John Lennon fans. This CD offers some of John's best recordings.  Listening to this CD you get the feel for John's true talent as a song writer and includes so much emotion.  We often forget that John was a deep thinking, compasionate man, we are reminded of that with this CD.  Listening to this CD will allow you to go back in time and connect with the most awesome music artist to ever live (my opinion).  In the song &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; you can just feel him singing this song for Sean.  In the song &quot;Mother&quot; I can feel his pain and feeling of loss.  Who could forget &quot;Power to the People&quot;? Such a controversial song in it's time. The cut &quot;Love&quot;, will give you the chills...  <br />This is a must have to add to or complete a John Lennon collection.  Don't miss out...pick this one up, you'll listen over and over again and love it each time.<br />I love you John Lennon.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I saw this movie at 12:30 in the middle of the night on Tv. I didn't know much about the story but I heard Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were in it so I decided to watch it.  I wondered how Tom Cruise could portray a vampire.  He's my fav actor but he always seemed to be the nice (and cocky) hero.  Wow!! When he first appeared i didn't reconize him he was so good!!  The movie held me riveted the entire time by the great acting.  I was chilled by Kirsten Dunst's performance as the child vampire.  This movie is so good!!
B000069HKH|5.0|The Wait was worth it.  This instant classic could also be called the Healing.  Brilliant, beautiful record which will stand with the best of Bruce...and that's saying a lot.  See ya'all on tour...
0316666343|5.0|Rich, well-drawn, complete characters, a moving, emotional plot, and  narrator that grips you and won't let go. These are my initial reactions to Alice Sebold's newest offering, \\"The Lovely Bones\\".<br />Much has been said about the plot, in fact, too much has been revealed. The narrator of the book, a young girl named Susie, is brutally murdered and tells her family's story from Heaven, a profoundly unique point of view to tell this story. Susie is very much a middle school girl, and her doubts and fears ,and essential innocence serve this story very well. The different events spell out after her death, as you see her family seize the immediacy of her death and then force to deal with its quiet horror for years afterward.<br />I can appreciate some people's dissatisfaction with a certain plot device, but taken within the whole context of the story, it worked well for me. In fact, this isn't a story that solely relies on plot to move forward, but the rich characters that you come to love. This books unfurls before you like a rich quilt, and scene after scene builds a quiet sense of beauty, moreso than the last one, so that by the time the book is finished, you are sorry to let it go.<br />Letting go is a central theme in this book, and thanks to Alice Sebold, it has been explored in a truly unique way. Ignore the naysayers of the book... read this in the quiet of your life, and appreciate well crafted writing at its finest.

B000069CWE|4.0|This album is original despite the fact that its not that original. Of course yes, most all of the songs are cuts from the previous studio hit album Hybrid Theory. This is basically a remix CD. But its a very unique remix album. Linkin Park decided to ask many popular DJ's and well known-artist (I.E. Aaron Lewis of Staind) and come in and mix everything up. The result is an album thats sounds very much like its NOT Linkin Park, but its fun to listen to and some of the tracks are amazing (Aaron Lewis version of Krwling). Some of the songs words are changed from the original and so it does provide something different. The only reason this is not a 5 star effort for its lack of cohesivessness. Some tracks are hip-hoppish with annoying DJ making up their own words. (In the End) and some are downright Moby-ish. TECHNO. Anyway I would say I really do enjoy listening to it. Anyone who was a fan of Hybrid Theory should get this......at least it will hold them over until the next all-new studio album.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Wonderful, absolutely fantastic DVD.  Monty Python's crowning achievement in silliness is given fantastic treatment here and makes good use of it.  The behind the scenes bits are very interesting and quite funny.  The archives of the artwork and sketches are a nice inclusion, but it would have been nice if they were bigger or could be zoomed in on.  Maybe I'm missing a button somewhere.<br />The original trailers were brilliant and I had never viewed them before so it was great seeing them for the first time.<br />The movie itself looks great and should be standard issue for all mental hospitals or places where people are treated for depression.  Unstoppable giddiness is really the best way I can describe it.<br />There are some DVD's that you can be content to rent once or every so often.  The Holy Grail is a DVD that really must be owned.  No matter what awful events are happening in your life, this silly tale will certainly allow you to look on the bright side of life.<br />Just pop it in to see a scene or two, you'll feel better in no time.<br />Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time!
B000069CWE|5.0|When I first heard about this cd, I thought Linkin Park was destined to fall off the planet. It really takes a lot of balls to take your first studio cd and remix it into your second studio cd. Even more, it takes a lot of talent to make it work. <br />After listening to this cd, I regret ever having doubted LP. They came through with some brilliant collaborations and excellent new beats. This cd really has a techno/rap feel with some remix tweaking... <br />I would definitely recommend picking up this cd, it's destined to go multi-platinum with its quasi-twin, Hybrid Theory.
B000002BQK|4.0|I have always been a fan of Mariah's and this is one of my most favorite out of all her CDs.  The songs, My All and Breakdown are my favorites so check it out.
B00006690F|5.0|They're all good. I really only bought the CD to get 'Without Me', but I ended up listening to the whole thing over and over. I love all his CDs because you can listen to one of these super-serious songs, have it end, then burst out laughing when it's over. Great beats, all A+s.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is an awsome cd!I thougt it would [disappoint], but when i heard it , it blew me away!

0316666343|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time.  It is well written and interesting from the first line.  You fall in love with the main characters immediately.  You cheer for them, hurt for them, and worry for them.  This book will make you laugh and cry.  I highly recommend it and can't wait to see what Alice Sebold with produce next.
B000069HKH|4.0|Dear Friend,                           The Boss Is Back!   Today I broughtThe Rising, new music by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. The very act of buying a Rock and Roll record is exciting. After all I'm too old to rock and roll but to young to die rock fan. I cant recall the last time I brought a new, day of release, rock record.  Buying this Album is not a leap of faith its a reason to believe.   The Music For The Rising Bruce gives us 15 songs. I believe this is the most songs he has ever put on one disc.. I have listened all the songs to once on my stereo  and now I am hearing the songs for a second time on my headphones as I sit my compute and write this. With out a doubt this is the most challenging record Bruce has ever put out. As a writer Springsteen explores his usual themes, but it is as a musician that finds Bruce driving down roads he has never traveled. Produce Brendan OBrien must be credited for giving Bruce and E Street a fresh sound while always staying true to their roots. It is to soon for me to say which songs will be classics and which will be also ran I know I will be spending lots of time with this one for these hot summer days.  As Bruce would say My favorite record is on the turn table I drop the neddle and pray Turn it up
B000069HKH|5.0|If you think every Bruce Springsteen album is &quot;Born in the USA&quot;, if you think that every Bruce Springsteen song sounds like &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; or if you believe the critics that this an &quot;a September 11 album&quot; then you are wrong.<br />This is a remarkable collection of different styles of music, showcasing the diversity not only of Springsteen's songwriting, but of his voice and of the E Street Band.<br />The 9/11 themes are there, but the songs would be just as relevant if the terrible events of that day had never happened. Songs like &quot;The Rising&quot;, &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; and Counting on a Miracle&quot; are great contemporary music for people who have outgrown top 40. They deal with adult issues in an adult manner.<br />If you buy this album, you will not be disappointed. This is, hands down, the best record of the year and most likely, the best record of the past 5 years.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I personally think that this is one of the best movies to come out. It involves a lot of vulgar humor wich i love I think Kevin SMith is the best director and all his movies are the bomb. BOOOOOONG.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Ok, ok, first of all, I don't see this movie as a modern Pinocchio. This movie, as other great science fiction films, I think it deals with the identity topic. Philip K. Dick once wrote a story named \\"Do Adroids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\\", and that story would later inspire the movie Blade Runner. And Blade Runner has a lot more similarities to this film than Pinocchio, simply because it deals with the idea of artificial intelligence. How do we respond to this great advance of technology?<br />David, the young robot created to be an adoptive child for couples, knows he was artificially created. Because of that, his new parents aren't sure he can actually have feelings, so they treat him like a toy. His \\"mom\\" is even affraid of starting to love David because \\"it's only a machine\\". And there are people around who even enjoy destroying these robots, known as \\"mechas\\", while the \\"orgas\\" are the human beings.<br />So David starts a search for a way to become a \\"real\\" boy so his mommy can love him. And during his search, he only receives the help of a classy Gigolo (Jude Law) and a little mecha teddy bear (one of the finest things about the movie) and during his search, he realizes of a few important things about himself, about his identity, and about the fear of mankind to the uknown. This take us to the climax of the movie, which many people thought it wasn't as good as the rest of the film, but I think it's the perfect ending. And no, people, IT IS NOT a happy ending. If you still think so, maybe you didn't get the point of the film.<br />This movie is not great because of its special effects, it is not great because it is a Spielberg film, and it sure isn't great because of Haley Joel Osment. Yes, they sure are good elements, but what makes this movie exceptional is the storyline. Its premise, pure and simple. But that's my humble opinion, though. By the way, great music, Johnny!
B000069CWE|5.0|I bought this cd the day it was released, and I am not disappointed!  Don't take my word for it, just go and get it for yourself.  If you are a Linkin Park fan, I think you will like it.  If not, what the heck? Give it a try
B000065V1V|5.0|We have Bowie music again that you can't stop playing...over and over again. It is amazing to see an artist break through with a style that combines the past and present into something magical and brilliant. I have been waiting for this cd for years and he has done it. Bravo!
6305609721|5.0|This is a good movie if you want comedy. Anyways, the entire crew is back, back to the past that is. A probe causing earths atmosphere to go haywire sends the crew back to 1986 or so to find two whales, preferabbly Humpback. Spock calculates everyhing from memory, but leads the crew into a dilemma. The dilithium crystal in the \\"enemy wessel\\" (don't ask-they're in a klingon warbird) has run dry and they have to find more. They each split up into teams: Kirk and Spock find the whales; Scotty, McCoy, and Sulu find the plexiglass and helicopter; and Uhura and Chekov find the dilithium. Everybody but Uhura and Chekov find everything. Due to radiation, only one can beam up at a time. Uhura beams up, and the guards find Chekov. Prepare for the chase scene! It doesn't last very long though. He falls off a ledge and ends up in the hospital. Prepare for another chase scene!! Kirk and McCoy go to the hospital, and when they get back, they've got the beam up coordinates and everything set to go. The whale-chick(forgot her name) wants to go with them, and stay with George and Gracie(the whales), proving the point that \\"you don't see a marine biologists everyday in the 24th century.\\" Using the sling-shot effect with the sun, the crew makes it back to the 24th century, to face the charges agaisnt them. But, since they did all that they did, the headguys forget all the charges, but demote Kirk back to Captain. The probe leaves and everyone is happy.  The End!!!!
B00005A46T|5.0|Iowa is an album that was recorded by masterminds! The music is much heavier, faster, melodic, and better than their self titled debut which is still very good and is selling! Iowa shows a different side of the band with the vocals on songs like Gently, Iowa, and New Abortion. In those songs Slipknot have brought a new element with them! Corey8Taylor sings more but, has also brought a kind of sadness to the lyrics. This band is a heavy hitter that just will not stop! They are not for the weak so all you preps stay away from this nine man freak show which consist of Sid0Wilson, Joey1Jordison, Paul2Gray, Chris3Fehn, James4Root, Craig5Jones, Shawn6Crahan, Mick7Thompson, and Corey8Tatlor. If you are new to Slipknot then you are probably thinking \\"Who needs nine people to run a band?\\" Well this is the think so many people put this band down because, they can't stand them or they think that they have no talent at all. Well if you saw them on stage then you would know how much talent this band has! Sid0Wilson is the D.J. and he does a hell of a job at it on the song Spit It Out on their self titled debut! When he doesn't play a part in a song he will crowd surf all the time jumping from anywhere! He even jumped off of a twenty foot balcony once trying to crowd surf but, he missed the crowd and landed on a guard rail breaking two of his ribs. Joey1Jordison is one of the best new drummers that you will ever see! He invents stuff that you haven't even heard before that works out great with the guitars! Paul2Gray is one of the members of the band that doesn't look like he is much of a talker but, he will quickly reinvent himself with his killer distorted bass riffs! Chris3Fehn is probably one of the coolest guys in the band because, just watching him move around is a thrill! He is funny lookin with that mask but, he will bang his head and that nose will flop! He is a percussionist so he gives a heavy beat to the songs. James4Root on guitar is pretty cool! He looks like LeatherFace from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre! Craig5Jones is on sampler! He is one of the biggest members of the band because, he invents some stuff that you have never I mean even once in your life heard before! He does some scary stuff. Shawn6Crahan is crazy! He is a percussionist just like Chris but, he Bangs his head on everything! Mick7Thompson I think is one the best new guitar players on the metal scene right now! His work in the songs Gently, Iowa, and Everything Ends I couldn't believe it! I had no idea that he could do something that great! Corey8Taylor is a different kind of vocalist! Using all kinds of tones he does some things that no other new bands have done. If you really want to get into Slipknot then I think that you should get their debut first because, in this album they do alot of different things. If you are a fan of Slipknot then you are another maggot. I hope Slipknot are still going to be around for a couple of years so we can see if they have more to contribute to rock! Don't forget their reign of terror has just begun!
B0000541AM|5.0|In my opinion this is THE BEST gang movie ever made. I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters, which would have made me 9 years old. My friends and I even dressed up as The Furies for Halloween in the 6th grade. And how funny that those same friends and I are going to do it for Halloween this year and we're all in our 30's!<br />The soundtrack rocks and so does the movie. I won't go into detail, because I'm sure most of you know what it's about. If you haven't seen it yet, do so now!
0790729687|5.0|When I bought this DVD, I had already read some of Anne Rice's work and hoped that the film would do the book justice. It definately did.<BR> I won't describe the plot to you, you have probably already discovered the main drill from other reviews. But to sum it all up, the story is about a 200-year old vampire named Louis (played excellently by Brad Pitt), who is lured into the immortality of the damned by a supremely evil and charismatic vampire named Lestat (stylishly played by Tom Cruise), then tormented by an unalterable fact of vampire life: to survive, he must kill.<BR> Tom Cruise steals the show. He made a perfect Lestat. Brad Pitt also pulls off the \\"whiny\\" Louis brilliantly, and Kirsten Dunst shows her great talent in such an early stage of her acting career as Claudia, the child vampire who longs to grow up.<BR> Overall, I give this film 100%. I have never seen a more intriguing, sensual or spellbinding vampire film like this one.
0380789035|5.0|Gaiman really did his homework when researching religions. I was really impressed with the way the story unfolded.
B000001E3V|5.0|Yeah, so this album is simply the best rock album I own.  All I can say is that you desparately need to own this album.  If you like rock and roll or music at all, buy this album.  Each song can be chosen as a favorite and listened to multiple times so that each lick of the guitar and beat of the drum are remembered.  Why does love got to be so sad, and Got to Get Better in A Little While are absolutely phenomenal songs.  The version of Why does love... on Layla... starts and ends before you can even really get the feel for it.  Not so with the version presented here- it starts with a 2minute guitar preamble where Clapton sort of starts revving up the engine, then BAM you get main the riff and shouting voices and we're off into the song.  The playing on this song is simply transcendental.  On the Cream Farewell Concert DVD they interview Clapton who demonstrates the difference between aggressive playing verses relaxed blues emotional playing.  This song captures both perfectly as Clapton tears through blistering solos for the first half of the song.  Then, as they keep playing there is this beautiful and perfect transition to where the playing becomes more sparse and lower ferocity and wonderfully melodic.  Clapton shows his virtuoso mastery of the electric guitar.  And Got to Get Better in A Little While is equally intense, it is like a room created by walls of of blazing blues guitar, I personally think that Clapton's absolute best guitar moment on record is directly after Whitlock's drum bit at 6:02 at 6:10 to 6:46- absolutely sublime!  There are simply extraordinarily rare moments of this equivalent anywhere on record.  I have given this album to brothers and friends, immediately turning them into Clapton fanatics.  Don't miss this.  Lastly, I have to admit that after comparing this recording to many other albums, I have to agree with another reviewer here that the remixing that was done is completely second rate.  I have taken this CD to retail stores and tested it in top of the line radio equipment and it simply is lacking.  This frustrating fact makes me want to purchase all the equipement required to play the vinyl recording of this album.  Or maybe I'll have to blow a huge wad and get the gold disc version.
B00000HZFP|5.0|I got a chance to see this rock musical live in Austin, TX and the performance was totally awesome. I got goosebumps and I even cried.<br />I had to have the CD and I still love the music and especially the really thoughtprovoking lyrics. A very unusual story with an eclectic mix of songs. It's really all about tolerance and we could use a lot more of that in our world.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Wow!...That was my feeling after the first viewing of \\"The Usual Suspects\\". The entire movie is non-stop action. Between all the bomb explosions, interigation scenes, and intense situations lies a great plot. Then comes the end of the movie. The point where this goes from being a four star action film to one of the best movies i have ever seen. If you don't know what I'm talking about then you must see this film. It's definitely not your usual movie.
6304806418|4.0|I saw the film the week it opened back in 1996 and just bought the DVD. But I must say: If this film irked you, you should've seen the stage show, which was even more brittle and astringent with its completely *unsympathetic* portrayal of Sra. Peron. One masterstroke is that the film sets out to give Eva more sympathy than the play did (never mind that she ultimately remained an enigma; that was the case of the actual woman also). But the film makes some important alterations throughout the story. In the stage show Eva uses, then throws over, Magaldi. This is reversed in the film, with Magaldi leaving her at his door (making her a kind of spurned victim) which ultimately leads to the spotlight torch song \\"Another Suitcase In Another Hall\\" (sung on stage, by the way, by a background character). Later, when she sings \\"You Must Love Me,\\" she is further softening the Evita character. (The lyrics illustrate the couple's marriage of convenience and how now that they're coming to the end, maybe there's love in their union after all.) But many scenes- several of Madonna's songs, *all* of Banderas's - are quite impressive. And the scene on the balcony (the \\"Casa Rosada\\"), is worth the price of the DVD, just to hear the chant of \\"Peron! Peron!\\" change over to \\"Evii-ta! Evii-ta!\\"
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Oookay...Take it easy everyone. Why so much hate for this film?This is science fiction at its best. Cheesy? Check! Bad acting? Check! Creatures? Check! Awesome special effects? Check! (kinda reminds me of that 'masterpiece' Attack of the Clones, not worth the film it was printed on, but extremely enjoyable nevertheless). Who gives a crap whether or not it has a plot?  It's damn fine entertainment. And lay off Guy Pearce. I never thought he was painful to watch in any of his prior films- Priscilla/LA Confidential/Memento. Honestly, were you all expecting something better? In my opinion (and thank god I am entitled to one) this movie reeked in a good way (unlike 'planet of the apes', which smelled too bad to excuse). I really enjoyed it as much as I did \\"I know what you did last summer\\" and I am an adult who is not afraid to admit that sometimes my brain needs a break.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Effects were top notch ... story line a little long and not very dramatic.  The CGI effects were fantastic and well worth a look.  My advice is buy it for the effects and then lend it to your friends !!!!!
B00005JL3A|4.0|A Zombie film with no gore?...surely not!!<BR>However, it almost works...almost. Paul Andersons not done too bad a job with it considering i thought they were gonna turn it into a pg13 when Romero left the production, but far too many movies have been pillaged in it (Matrix, Dawn of the Dead, Aliens, Cube) so if you seen any of these films youll be seeing the same thing but in a slightly different way.  Acting is occasionally dodgy but bearable.  Overall a good film, if youre a fan of RE of course.  Sequel should be better.
B000069HKH|5.0|I can't believe I'm one of the first to get to review such a great album.  I expected it to be very good after I heard the single &quot;The Rising,&quot; but it just surpassed all my expectations I had for it.  This is truly one of best albums to have come out this year thus far.  Bruce Springsteen is such a good songwriter.  While other artists probably would have had written lyrics filled with anger regarding the events of September 11th, Bruce writes instead of love, hope, and the positive side of the human spirit.  The song &quot;Into The Fire&quot; deals with those who died trying to save others in the WTC. &quot;Nothing Man&quot; is a song from the point of view of one of the WTC rescuers who survived.  The CD has the studio version of &quot;My City Of Ruins,&quot; which was also on the America: A Tribute To Heroes CD.  I think the best song on the album is &quot;Worlds Apart,&quot; which actually has nothing to do with September 11th, but seems to belong and fit in on the album just the same.  This album is full of great songs. The music just rises above anything you hear on the Top 40 stations today. Definitely a classic album.
0385503954|5.0|It took me a little while to get into this book.  What kept me going was the way this guy writes, his choice of words, his flow, his structure.  Not much happens at first and I almost put it down, figured I fell for all the hype and shoulda spent my money on a couple of movies.  Wrong.  All of sudden the novel shifts into overdrive and took me for a ride until the last page.  This is the only book I've read by McEwan, but will read more.  I told a friend about the book; he had just finished it and made the comment: &quot;No wonder they write so well (they being the Brits).  They own the language.&quot;  I recommend you read this book, but be patient.  Let the author lay the groundwork, fully develop the characters, the setting... then look out!
B00005OM4N|5.0|I read some of the other reviews and saw that quite a few people didn't really dig on Britney's new album.  People said that it was too mature for twelve year old girls.  Well, I think that it is a more mature album...since Britney is growing up...and she's doing a great job.  The fans that were twelve when she started are growing up and so is she, so it would have to be assumed that her music would mature as well.  I think this album showed off her style and gave her some freedom in the writing process.  I loved it and think it's the best yet.<br />I'm A Slave 4 U has such a great beat and makes me want to dance.  Boys is a great tribute to Janet Jackson's Nasty Boys...but better.  I absolutely love Anticipating and it makes me just want to have fun.  There's a lot of heart and soul in \\"Britney\\" and it's more mature than the other two.  Love it!
B000069CWE|1.0|Did anyone stop to think that maybe this was a bad idea?  Thanks to Limp Bizkit, Destiny's Child, and P. Diddy, we now have a rise in popularity of something pathetic called the \\"Remix album\\".  The only sad thing is that Linkin Park wants to raise awareness that their album is not a remix project but rather a re-vision or a re-mastering of their past work.  <br />This idea and this type of music just doesn't work.  The first time around was a good time for all, but the new versions of Linkin Park's songs are completely unoriginal and frightfully boring.  The remixes lack the gravity that the originals had, snipping away essential parts of songs and melodies and pasting in stupid hip-hop beats and studio effects.<br />The only thing I can congratulate these guys on is the stellar sound production.  The treble really rings and the bass really pounds.  This is the second time DJ Joseph Hahn has outdone his usefulness for the band.<br />>>> 1 star for Linkin Park releasing filler material before their second album.  If you're looking for people who know what a remix is, go buy \\"Community Service\\" by the Crystal Method.<br />- the enlightened one
B000069CWE|5.0|this is definately worth buying if you are a HUGE linkin park fan! they redid the songs but in a good way so they dont lose there touch the beets are awesome the lyrics are sooooooo good! if your an lp fan and u dont buy it seriously your messed up this is going to be a hit cd!
B000069HKH|5.0|I have so much respect for Bruce Springsteen just for represent-<br />ing New Jersey so well! He's the ultimate rocker,man.He's down to earth,funny,witty yet still rocks.His music has always been personable and accesible.He even had a fairly big black auidence back in the day.Springsteen's lastest set is no exception.Yet another classic! Springsteen's trademark voice is still there and the producer,supplied by Korn producer Brenden O'Brian is pretty good.All the songs are likeable.This will be a hit.Another #1 debut for sure! I just had to give The Boss his due for representing Jersey!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is great music to listen to when you are stressed out and just want to unwind. Her voice and and the piano have a way of soothing you even on the worst day. I don't know much about jazz music, and so if you're a hard core jazz fan I don't know how you'd feel about this. But I do know that to the average listener, even people that usually never listen to jazz, this is a great cd to own and is a nice change from the same old sounds you hear on the radio.
B000065V1V|4.0|Poor Bowie . . . no matter what he does, unless he can create something that can eclipse his early masterpieces like &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, people will continue to pan him off as a pseudo-hasbeen. Which is unfair, because this disc proves that he can still make good music without just pickpocketing from his back catalogue or cozying up to the latest mainstream trend. Of course it's not better than Ziggy . . . but it doesn't need to be, because it's good all on its own.<BR>One striking thing about this album is how relaxed Bowie sounds . . . he makes it sound easy after all these years. Especially on his cover of &quot;I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship&quot;.<BR>This album also seems more aware of its surroundings than &quot;hours&quot; . . . the saxophone used on &quot;Gemini Spaceship&quot; spins the tune towards a 50's feel, acknowledging that songs about space are a bit silly (like the flying saucer movies of the 50's) and grounding it in more terrestrial concerns. And there's something delightfully 50's about the doowop background vocals of &quot;Everyone Says Hi&quot; and the chugging bass of &quot;Slow Burn&quot;. Of course, I didn't live through the fifties . . . all I've really got is a celluloid representation of an era, but Bowie seems to relate to time in a similarly stilted fashion, fusing together aspects and whispers from all over the last 50 years to create a timeless sound.<BR>So yeah, this is a good album. I got it because I'm a Bowie completist, but I enjoy it for it's own merrits, and when I caught myself singing &quot;A Better Future&quot; in my head the next week, I knew there was something to it.
0446677450|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki had the good fortune of having two dads: his biological father and his best friend's father, both of whom had opposing views on finances and building a financial future. His \\"rich dad\\" went on to build a billion dollar empire. His poor dad rose to the top of his profession, yet died poor.<br />Kiyosaki pulls no punches when he delivers hard-hitting financial advice that he learned over the years from his rich dad. These aren't \\"get rich\\" or \\"make lots of money easily\\" tips, but rather a system that takes careful planning and tough choices but, if followed, will change your life.<br />keep in mind that this book is a primer for investment strategy.  Kiyosaki does not lay out a step-by-step plan for accumulating wealth, but rather focuses on building the right foundation on which you will build your own wealth.  Contrary to what other reviewers have said, Kiyosaki does not encourage people to quit their jobs and not go to college.  He actually encourages both -- explaining that experience and knowledge are important.  Kiyosaki spends a great deal of time insisting that individuals take classes, read books and use tax/legal advisors to help build their empires from the ground up.<br />With that said, I've spent years studying investing strategies and the ins and outs of building companies so that I could make a move into self-employment and eventually financial independence. My drive to not waste my life making other people rich has been something that's been at odds with my own father's philosophy and that of most people I've known. Kiyosaki says it is this very attitude that seperates the rich from the poor and he takes his time explaining how. The knowledge I've gained over the years in investing and company-building now has a new perspective: Kiyosaki teaches you not to work for yourself, but rather have your money work for you and make you rich by acquiring assets rather than liabilities (sounds simple, but I was surprised by how many people don't understand the difference between the two).<br />There are a lot of books out there that try to teach you to be rich through being cheap, or how to make money quickly by day-trading or just about anything else. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.  Kiyosaki will help you build a foundation on which your fortune can be built, but it takes time and commitment on your part.  Most people are turned off by that concept and will spend the next 20 years trying to find a get-rich-quick plan, rather than just gradually building up their empire over that time span.<br />Kiyosaki concedes that you can save your way to wealth, but why? What's the point of spending years building financial independence and not enjoy the fruits of your labor? At the same time, Kiyosaki's strategies teach a healthy mix of self-control and wise-investing.<br />This book isn't for everyone. If you are willing to learn a new way of thinking and are willing to take some risk and serious commitment to your dream in order to meet your financial dreams, then this book is for you.<br />If you want to play it safe and go the \\"tried and true\\" route, then don't waste your time on this book.  The \\"tried and true\\" route is the one that keeps everyone else in debt and away from their financial dreams.  If that's your way of thinking, I'd recommend saving your money on this book and putting it toward your retirement fund.understand the difference between the two).<br />There are a lot of books out there that try to teach you to be rich through being cheap, or how to make money quickly by day-trading or just about anything else.

B00005QIPH|5.0|I love it how some reviewers have to point out that The Strokes are from privellaged backgrounds . . . so what?  If you're complaining about it, you probably are, too. <BR>Anyhow, this is a great album. Sure, it sounds a good deal like the Velvet Underground, but it doesn't come off as derivative or stale. Think of it as 'a velvet underground expansion team'. The Strokes have a gift for churning out just the right riffs that sound instantly familar and relentlessly catchy. <BR>And ah yes, they're actually getting mainstream attention . . . so what? I, for one, would not mind actually hearing something I LIKE on the radio.<BR>Yeah, perhaps not the most unique or deep album you could buy, but definitely a lot of fun.
B000069HKH|5.0|When you first listen to this album, there are times you think the Jersey native will go astray and disappoint, but he never does. Each song lives up to its potential and is rock ' n' roll at its roots. It's great to hear him wailing and the album is fantastic blend of rock ballads, rock tunes and wonderfully written lyrics. He never fails a song and the album just gets better and better towards the end as you feel his intensity. We finally have a rock album for today!! Way to go Bruce!
0316666343|5.0|I thought that \\"The Lovely Bones\\" was the best book I have read in quite some time.  It is absolutely haunting, the characters and the story will stay with you long after you finish the book.  The horror of Susie's death is conveyed, but without grisly details, and you feel the sadness of Susie and her family as they deal with her murder, and with life without her.  It was beautifully written.  I loved it.

1559408855|1.0|Intrigued by the controversy surrounding this movie, familiar with the supposed themes, and unfamiliar with the uncompromising and relentless brutality depicted in the film, I dove in feet first. I am no prude and believe in an artist's right to free expression.  However, this film has little redeeming value.  It is an excercise in perversion and exploitation.  It's depictions are almost as dehumanizing as the true life subjects that inspired this movie.  Those who believe it is hip and chic to apologize for films like this miss the point entirely.  I admit, I could not finish the movie.  I found watching a roomful of innocent youths forced to eat their own feces in graphic detail nauseating, unsettling, and strangely banal.  Populating a film with images of extreme violence does not substitute for commentary or condemnation.  Leering at these victims is tantamount to one being complicent in their fates.  There is nothing educational, liberating, life-affirming, or redeeming about Salo.  I strongly urge anyone considering viewing this film against wasting their time.  The points made in Salo have been made better in much more dignified settings.  Unless you have a desire to watch unspeakably dehumanizing acts, skip Salo.  If this is your thing, skip out on the nonexistent artistic pretense and take a trip to your neighborhood adult movie store.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is what I have been waiting for. Dave Matthews Band is alot, but not enough. John Mayer is pure music with a metallic voice and great guitar skills. 'City Love' is probably the best jam on the cd. Listen to the electric on that song. 'Love song for No One' is definetly one of the best songs. There's always the hit song 'No such thing' to listen to. '83' profiles a man's wish to be young again. 'My stupid mouth' portrays when men make mistakes while talk to women that they don't really mean, easing the pains of rejection in certain men, showing that you aren't the only one. 'Neon' also has great guitar. Try to find the live acoustic version if you can on the internet. It's better than on the album. 'Your Body is a Wonderland' talks about a man telling a woman what she needs to hear, and giving her what she needs AND wants. '3x5' exemplifies someone keeping things inside him that he WANTS to keep to himself. I kind of consider this CD sort of a 'Relationships 101' with looks from every perspective.
B000069CWE|5.0|This cd is great! I think Hybrid Theory is still a little better though. But seriously, get this cd if you love Linkin Park. I will these two cds forever and any more to come! Go Linkin Park!!! WOO-HOO!
B000056K04|3.0|DMB messed up a reputation of original music. This cd is way to pop-like. The Space Between was a hit, but it is not a good song.<BR>I used to think it was good, but then I bought other DMB cd's and compared them to Everyday. The songs were all-new. The album was hyped. But it wasn't good at all. I don't like it, but maybe you will. Buy it, I always like someone who supports Dave Matthews Band.
B000001DYJ|2.0|I've been a Kiss fan since I was 4 yrs old.  In all that time I've never given up on the band (even during the Unmasked & Crazy Nights eras, I even loved The Elder).  To be honest I didn't think it was possible for Kiss to make a bad live CD but I was wrong.  Don't get me wrong... the song selection is great, the band is great but Alive III is far to over produced.  It just sounds fake, like the band played to an empty hall and dubbed in the audience. It sounds so obvious during Paul's abbreviated between song chatter & as previous reviewers said during certain songs.  I am totally shoked that something bearing Eddie Kramer's name should be so poorly produced (Who knows maybe it's the \\"and Kiss\\" part of the production team that was the problem).  I like this CD but it just doesn't compare with Alive! or Alive II.  As a fan all I can do is hope and pray Alive IV doesn't suffer from the same GLARING flaws.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|&quot;How Wonderful life is, now Nicole Kidman is in the world...&quot;<BR>True is that statement. Nicole Kidman brilliantly lights up the screen in the oscar-winning production 'Moulin Rouge' From the very beginning with&quot;Nature Boy&quot; and through with Ewan Mcgregor's &quot;not his&quot; voice, (even though it is beautiful)the musical touch is a great adittion to the great plot. This movie also features compilations of touching love songs, like Your Song, by Elton John. I also have the soundtrack, which is great despite the overplayed &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; This is a story of lust and love, passion and romance, and a love that nothing can break. The villain, 'Count', has a awesome voice and a plays an excellent bad-guy role. The great part is how Christian (Mcgregor) persuades Satine (Kidman)to break the rules and love him like she wants too. Harold Sidler is the director of the Moulin Rouge (Jim Broadbent), and he plays a magnificent role, displayed with his Oscar Nomination. A great film for all ages, you will laugh cry, and want to have the love that Christian and Satine share in this epic film.
B000069CWE|5.0|I am always weary of so-called &quot;Remix Albums.&quot;<br />They are usually the same over-played song with a new bass line or beat.  This is not the case with &lt;i&gt;Reanimation&lt;/i&gt;.  The tracks have been remixed by a diverse group of entertainers and promise a mix for all people's preferences.<br />The songs are not exactly the same either.  Some of the lyrics have been redone to create a new effect or meaning(s) to the song(s).<br />This is a prime example of a remix album done right.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is the best story ever. Thousands of people saw and loved this movie. Hanks play Forrest Gump as slow, methodical person who comes through all of the hate that is given to him and uses it to create a positive life for himself. His travels; from Greenbow, Alabama, through college, playing football for Bear, and becoming a war hero in Vietnam, Forrest sets an example for everyone, even though it is a movie. I can watch this movie anytime and be satisfied. It is a movie for the heart. His love for the people close to him, his mama, Jenny, and his son, Little Forrest, evidences his good heart and mind. If you have never seen this movie, it doesn't matter, just go and get it. It is a necessity. Love to everyone, ---Julian---

B000003S09|5.0|If any album foreshadowed the end of the 1960s, it would be this one. This album is filled with morbid themes and unsettling rhythms and melodies. Their experiments in jazz, classical, and heavy rock was like the exact opposite of all things psychedelic. They avoided pop at all costs, which was extremely admirable.<BR><BR>What makes this debut so challenging is the length and structure of the songs. This album only has 5 songs, the shortest one 6 minutes (the mellow &quot;I Talk To The Wind&quot;). Most debuts have more of a pop sensibility to them and sometimes 6 minutes is the longest song on the album, but not this. Plus, the energy and the somber and angry attitude of the songs was rather daring.<BR><BR>The collapse of the 60s is expressed in the opener &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man,&quot; with its lyrics about war and greed, and a very chaotic middle 6/8 jazz-secion, and of course one of the heaviest riffs ever. War is also expressed in a more medieval way with the closing title track, with the use of woodwinds, and the mellotron. Depression and confusion makes up &quot;Epitaph,&quot; one of the saddest songs I can think of, and then &quot;Moonchild&quot; which deals with some sort of love. It has  a beautiful guitar line to it, before it goes into about 10 minutes of soft jazz guitar noodling. &quot;I Talk to the Wind,&quot; I think deals with the idea of poor communication between people, referring to humans as &quot;the wind&quot; for &quot;the wind cannot hear.&quot;  if you look at the lyrics closely.<BR><BR>A great debut by one of the most groundbreaking bands in history.<BR>King Crimson and John Lennon's solo debuts (though released a year after this one) was all the proof a person needed to say that the mentality of the 1960s was over.
B00006AUIG|3.0|Session Nine really left me scratching my head.  To be fair, the first time I watched it the conditions were somewhat shy of optimal.  I broke it up over two days and was pulled away during several key sequences by phone calls and babies crying.  To make sure that I gave the film it's proper attention I locked all the doors and watched it through a second time, but was still left with most of the same questions.  <br />To start off, the characters are the basic archetypes that inhabit thrillers such as these.  This being a `working man thriller', the roles do not include one of the most recognizable; the mad (or at least quirky) scientist.  Alien made it without one, so I guess we can survive sans one here.  Present are:<br />The business owner/corporate guy focused on saving the business/profits and damn the rest of the world. (Except, of course, his family back home usually shown through rain swept windows or in a nice soft focus memory)<br />The hard working, morally centered second in command who has recently lost the love of his life to...<br />The lazy bastard everyone loves to hate.  <br />Also present are: The intellectual who doesn't really fit in working with the blue collar guys, but has a secret; and the rookie kid on his first job who we all know will end up dying some horrible way.<br />The first third of the movie is dedicate to the set up and loaded with the required exposition.  I always find it amazing that security guards and DPW workers can be such a thorough source of back story and vital historical information.  The head of the DPW who contracts our heroes to remove the asbestos from the soon to be remodeled asylum is conveniently married to the local historian; a slightly contrived convenience, but forgivable since the device does allow the story to move along quicker.<br />Looking back,  I see that most of what I've stated thus far has been pretty harsh, but I did like this flick.  The characters, though broadly sketched, are likeable (well,except for the lazy bastard) and the acting made me forgive most of the weaknesses of the script.  What really pulled me out of the experience, even in the second viewing, was the \\"twist\\" ending.<br />The way the clues are laid out as to who the killer is really do point to pretty much any one of the guys working (young guy who you know will die horribly excluded, of course) and a few other folks as well.  What it reminded me of, strangely enough, was a stage play my wife and I saw in Boston several years ago called Shear Madness.  The plot revolves around a murder in a hair salon and at the end the audience actually votes to decide who the killer is.  There are enough `facts' pointing at each cast member that when the detective starts explaining the motives and opportunities we can believe the person we selected is guilty.  Session 9 could easily subject itself to such a gimmick.  (Hmm.  With DVD's branching abilities...)<br />I don't know if this is supposed to be a puzzle movie, like the Sixth Sense, or a straight on psychological/haunted house horror like The Shining and I'm not convinced that the movie itself knows what it wants to be.  If only the cast weren't so damn likeable it would be easy to pan this flick entirely, but I can't.  David Caruso and company bring such believability and a wonderfully grounded nature to this movie that I really do feel compelled to watch it a third time and really `get' it.  I only hope that there really is something to get.
B000069HKH|1.0|Unlike Paula Abdul's &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;, almost none of the musicians featured on &quot;The Rising&quot; are animated.  If you are looking for an album where a cartoon cat duets with a major artist, this is not the record for you.
0679882820|5.0|This book is a \\"Board Book\\", which means it's a smaller version of the original, printed on sturdy board pages that babies and toddlers can't tear, bend, or otherwise destroy. Hence, the lower pricetag.<br />This book has been great. It was our toddler's favorite for quite some time. She loved the sounds and would try to imitate us when we read the book to her.  I had this book when I was a child, along with many of the other Dr. Suess books. This is a great introduction into the series, especially for children who are just about to start learning to talk.
0609610570|1.0|Much to my disappointment, this book was not a &quot;how to&quot; guide to efficient corporal punishment, but rather some new-agey twaddle about how to run your business.  Don't be mislead by the title, there is almost no discussion of how to better conduct beheadings, firing squads, or hangings.  Save your money!
B000069CWE|5.0|This album begins with a strange, unexpected, classical tune in the opening.  Then they jump right into the music with the remix to &quot;Points of Authority&quot;, the first single of this remix album.  Then, fans of Linkin Park are treated to well-worked versions of the songs from HYBRID THEORY.  Most of the tracks include fresh, new beats, and more hip-hop verses provided by the likes of &quot;Chali 2NA&quot; from Jurassic 5, and &quot;DJ Babu&quot; from The Beat Junkies.  The music is stalled, skipped, and scratched to perfection by those remixing the tracks.  The intermission continues the strange classical music series of tracks taking place.  The rock fan of Linkin Park won't be dissapointed as the album closes with remixes of LP's first two singles (&quot;One Step Closer&quot;, and &quot;Crawling&quot;), featuring Jonathan Davis of Korn, and Aaron Lewis of Staind helping with the hooks of those respective tracks.  The strange, classical tracks are ended with the final &quot;Crawling&quot; remix.  This truly HYBRID album also includes mixes of &quot;My December&quot;, and &quot;High Voltage&quot;, the songs released with CD singles or the DVD.  In addition, the track &quot;X-Ecutioner Style&quot; gives the group their plug with a sort of Linkin Park Mega-Mix, and for no apparent reason, the album also includes three messages from Mike Shinoda's voicemail.  All in all, an excellent album.  <br />Best Tracks: Wth&gt; You [Way better than the original.],<br />Enth E Nd [Just when this song became unbearable to listen to (because of the radio station, not the band), Motion Man and Mike Shinoda make you love it again!]<br />Worst Track: Kyur4 Th Ich [Hard to remix what is just a bunch of scratches to begin with! Still better than it is worse.]

B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity is simply one of the best albums to come out in years, and System of a Down is the Elite of force in rock. You won't find any sappy love songs, or garbage lyrics on Toxicity. Lead singer Serj's vocals are hard-hitting, melodic, meaningful, and straight to the point. The bands songs don't dwell on social relationships, but instead their views on real-world issues. Their mix of hard rock riffs, powerful drumming, screaming vocals mixed with melodic lyrics, and heavy bassline work perfectly together. As do their Armenian influence mixed with Southern California attitude, provide rock fans a band with a completely distinct sound. Comparing System of a Down to bands like Slipknot, or Limp Bizkit though, is a complete insult. Slipknot is on a completely different playing field and has nowhere near the talent to hang with SOAD. Same goes for Limp Bizkit and with their garbage lyrics. System of a Down is far above and beyond their rock competitors both musically and lyrically. The only other bands that are in the same league as SOAD are Tool, The Strokes, Radiohead (Kid A; in particular), Incubus (before they sold out on Morning View), Linkin Park (even though their mainstream now), and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. System of a Down is the future of music, and I hope they continue to grow, evolve, and educate. From beginnning to end, SOAD delivers on Toxicity. My favorites are: Prison Song, X, Science, Shimmy, Toxicity, Aerials
B0000033WC|4.0|What's missing today from rock'n'roll is the sex. Most of the current rock bands sound asexual. It's like they'd rather be drinking beer and playing golf. If you want to listen to a work of art that oozes NYC attitude (Ramones/Iggy style, not the current kind personified by yuppie scoundrels who think they're on \\"Sex In The City\\"), then get this. This album moves, grooves and lays it on smooth. I defy you not to bop around to \\"Head Held High\\", \\"Rock'n'Roll\\", and \\"Who Loves The Sun.\\" This is a more straight-ahead Stonesy rock album, the others were much more avant-garde. The previously unreleased material is mostly stellar too. \\"Ocean\\" is a sensual psychedelic masterpiece.Just picture walking around the East Village on a Summer night with the smell of sex and fun in the air. This album not only captures that feeling, but actually defined it.
B00005JL3A|3.0|First of all, I'm a big Resident Evil fan, the game that is. But this movie is just a little disappointing. The sound is off somehow, sounds like they are far away or something. One would think that they would at least spend a bit more money to help support one of the best game series ever created. I did like seeing Milla kick some ass in a skirt though.
B000002IOW|5.0|This album really holds a special place in my heart.  Not only was it the first RUSH CD I ever owned (thanks Ma), but I saw them live for the first time on the PRESTO tour.  I saw the video for &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot; on Mtv and became hooked.  I drove my friends nuts senior year of '91 by playing the hell out of this CD.  If you haven't seen Rush live, you're missing out.  From the lasers to the 2 giant inflatable bunny rabbits coming out of 2 top hats to Neil Peart's awe-inspiring drum solo, it was at the time the greatest concert I ever saw.<br />  PRESTO begins with &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot; complete with the band's signature complex time changes.  Other highlights include &quot;The Pass&quot; an anti-suicide song beautifully written musically and lyrically. (You should see the video)  &quot;Scars&quot; simply rocks with its anthemic chorus and tribal beats.  The title track gives Alex Lifeson a chance to shine.  &quot;Superconductor&quot; is the heaviest track on the album; although it rocks, YOU should hear it live!  &quot;Anagram (for Mongo)&quot; Uh, I still don't know the parallel between the lyrics and the title, but it's still great.  &quot;Hand over Fist&quot; is another catchy tune with great lyrics and sing-along chorus. The final track is the beautiful &quot;Available Light&quot;.<br />  I cannot recommend this album enough.  I surprisingly heard a lot of people complain about the album being not heavy enough and lacking another &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; or &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot;.<br />Cry me a river.<br />  I don't know if this is their best album, but it still remains my favorite.  From start to finish there isn't a bad song here.<br />Enjoy the magic.
B00005JKNF|5.0|'Gosford Park' will, unfortunately, not appeal to everyone.  Some will think it moves too slow, some will think there's not enough action, and some will not want to keep up with all the characters.  That's too bad, but for those who stick with it, 'Gosford Park' will be a wonderful movie experience.<br />The plot is simple.  In November, 1932, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) has invited friends and family to his country estate for a hunting weekend.  Everyone arrives with his or her baggage, physical and emotional.  Director Altman expertly allows the viewer to eavesdrop on bits and pieces of seemingly random conversations that serve not so much to give us plot information, but to give us an insight into the characters and their lives.  And to pave the way for murder.<br />The first half of the film is a brilliant look at the rich and their servants.  The attendants are often treated as part of the furniture.  Often the wealthy guests carry on intimate conversations among themselves with the servants clearly in earshot.  But they are servants, their job is to serve, not to report conversations.  But when the rich are alone with their servants, they confide in them and share information they would never share with anyone else.  Altman does a masterful job of showing us that even though this is an English estate from 70 years past, things really haven't changed much.  <br />Many excellent characters are present in the film.  Sir William seems bored with the charade of hosting this event and seems to want to spend time only with his dog and his mistress.  The feelings are mostly mutual.  His dog seems to be the only one present who really loves him.  Bob Balaban is wonderful as American movie director Morris Weissman, who is more concerned about filming his next Charlie Chan movie than the real-life murder right under his nose.   <br />While all these character revelations are important and fascinating, they do go on perhaps a bit longer than they should.  Afterall, the film is past the halfway point before the murder is even committed.  But as the film moves closer towards the conclusion, viewers will begin to piece together all the information presented during the first hour to find a solution.  I would almost say that the solution is not as important as the journey getting there, but it is important because of its power.   <br />In watching the film, I almost thought that the movie did not deserve the R rating.  The rating was put there for some language and some very brief [love] situations, but probably to help define the audience.  Kids would probably not enjoy the film at all.  The same could probably be said for action-crazed teenagers.  However, if you enjoy interesting characters portrayed by a stellar cast in the hands of a masterful director, 'Gosford Park' is for you.  Enjoy.<br />Running time:  2 hours 16 minutes
B000002IWQ|3.0|No doubt about it.  The production is tight and smooth compared to the horrific production on albums like POWER WINDOWS, GRACE UNDER PRESSURE (compare the live version of \\"Red Sector A\\" to the rotten album version) and HOLD YOUR FIRE.  Alex Lifeson really works that distortion pedal on songs like \\"Stick It Out\\".  The songs mostly have good chops, but unlike their last two albums (PRESTO & ROLL THE BONES), they lack the musicmanship and melodies that stick to your brain.<br />    Now please let me get this off my chest:  I don't care if the song \\"Nobody's Hero\\" was written about the heros of September 11th, that still doesn't change the fact that the song is horrid.  It is the worst song Rush has ever written.  The melodies are as catchy as a car accident, the chorus sounds out of key and strained.  Lyrically, I'm surprised.  Neil Peart is a great lyricist, and these are a step backward.  He's capable of much more.<br />   Oh and another thing, my ripping of the song is NOT HOMOPHOBIA, and NOT ANTI-GAY!!!!!  The song is simply rotten lyrically and musically.<br />    The album itself is not bad, just slightly above average.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|This is one of Don Coscarelli's most frightening films that I have ever seen it is truly unlike anything that you've seen before & now finally with a new dolby digital and dts 5.1 sound & audio commentary by Don Coscarelli & Angus Scrimm with entire cast this is absolutely the best version of Phantasm that you'll ever see.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Yeah,yeah,yeah this movie is cool and has nice car scenes.Yeah.<BR>Whoopie-woo! But the thing that really makes this movie JUST stand out is VIN DIESEL.Vin brings out the little quivering,grinning little girl in me! And to see him topless in this movie.The joy!(LOL) Not to sound shallow but Vin,you're a beautiful man!:-) Another thing to look for in this movie is a good peformance by Michelle Rodireguez.She's a really good actress and her peformance was very strong.Whether you like or dislike this film is up to you,but Vin is all mine!(LOL)
B000069CWE|5.0|Since this was a remix album I wasn't expecting much from it. I thought it would be ... since another certain band made a god-awful remix album *cough* Limp bizkit *cough*. But after seeing the remix video for \\"Points of authority\\" on MTV2. I was amazed, it was awesome! So I downloaded a couple other tracks from the album and those were mind-blowin as well. I love the remixes for One step closer, In the End and High voltage. I just bought the album this morning and I haven't stopped listening to it since.This is a great CD for anyone who likes the nu-metal thing, there's hip hop, techno, alternative all mixed into one. It's like a whole different album! Defiently worth buying. Check it ouT!

0553212478|5.0|Those who know Frankenstein only from movies and television may well be surprised to read the original book by Mary Shelley.  Indeed, one may well look back to the cover to see if the book is in fact Frankenstein because the first pages consist of messages from an R. Walton to his sister concerning his expedition to the northern polar regions.  Victor Frankenstein appears as a wretched creature stranded on an ice floe beside the ship.  After he is rescued and recovers somewhat, he tells his incredible story to Walton, who in turn preserves the story in writing.  Frankenstein reminisces about his happy childhood, particularly the close relationship between himself and his &quot;cousin&quot; Elizabeth, and then explains how his interest in discredited natural philosophy led him to create a living man of his own design.  The creature is a hideous, misshapen, giant of a man who so disgusted Frankenstein upon his awakening that he fled his laboratory and residence.  The creation process, it should be noted, in no way involved an elaborate machine powered by lightning such as is portrayed in the movies; in fact, beyond the fact that chemicals are involved, we are told nothing of the process.  For two years, Frankenstein goes about life with a clinging sense of guilt and nervousness, hoping the creature has perished.  When his little brother is murdered, though, he returns home and soon discovers that it was the monster who committed the deed.  In an isolated mountainous area, the monster appears before him and explains his actions.  Although the creature does nothing more than grunt in the movies, the original Frankenstein was possessed of great eloquence and intelligence, and he tells a moving story about his attempts to make a connection with a society that is revolted at the sight of him.  He describes living in a small hovel at the back of a small house for many months, watching the interaction of the family inside, learning how to speak their language and eventually even learning how to read.  When he eventually tries to interact with the family, he is assaulted and runs away, and it is at this point that his virtuous and peaceful nature begins to become inflamed into a torrent of hatred for mankind. When he rescues a girl from drowning, he is rewarded with a bullet in his shoulder. Each time he performs a good deed, mankind runs from him in disgust or attempts to harm him.  Living in total isolation and loneliness, his one purpose in life eventually becomes tormenting his creator, and many terrible misfortunes ensue for Frankenstein, who himself eventually becomes dedicated to the sole purpose of destroying his tormentor.<br />Both Frankenstein and his monster are tragic figures.  The complete alienation of the creature makes him a very sympathetic character in many respects, and he does perform many kind deeds for humans early on.  Frankenstein is an utterly pitiable character utterly destroyed by his mad decision to create the monster; he burdens his soul with responsibility for every crime the monster commits, and his inability to tell anyone his secret for so long destroys him in body, mind, and soul; everyone and everything he cares for is taken from him by his horrible creation.  His tendency to bemoan his fate at every turn of the narrative can get rather tiresome, but one cannot question the depth of his turmoil.  Both creator and created seem to be mirror images of each other in important ways, their fates clearly tied to one another, each soul deserving both blame and pity.  There is much about human nature, both good and bad, revealed in the monster's life as well as Frankenstein's; the novel is a far cry from horror for the sake of horror.  This is actually a very complex, compelling story full of human pathos; it is unfortunate that modern media have turned Frankenstein's creature into a simple, heartless, mentally deficient monster for the sake of scares and laughs.even learning how to read.

B000001Y2U|5.0|First off, Brian warner a.k.a Marilyn Manson is a very brilliant man that does not get the credit he diserves.A Year ago i couldnt have imagined listening to his album. Some of my friends liked him and i was going to be open minded about him. The first coulpe of times i listened, i thought it was stupid. Later i Downloaded some of his songs and they grew on me. Later i was blow away by his musical talent.I own holy wood and mechanical animals and they are so different from ACS. ACS is on such a different level. I Heard Mechanical Animals before i heard this album and i loved it. The i bought ACS and was so overwelmed that when i popped in MA i was a little dissapointed. The Depth of the songs on this record is so incredible the talent is so unmatched. Amoung my favorites are Mister Superstar and tourniquet. I strongly recommend that if u plan to give manson a chance, get Mechanical Animals first, anybody that picks up this record should be prepared for its greatness and should be Pro Manson.If u like ANY of mansons stuff though give this one a try, and listen to it a couple times because you will be surprised on how much this cd grows on you (...)
B000069HKH|5.0|It's been a long time since Bruce's last studio album but The Rising proves the wait was worth it!<br />Bruce once again shows his ability to understand and empathize with everyday people and the life altering events that shape our world.
B000069HKH|5.0|After a too-long break from recording a studio album with the E-Street Band, Bruce is back in a big way.  Springsteen draws on his greatest strengths as a lyricist and puts together a great series of rock anthems, most focusing on life as it was affected by the attacks of September 11th (be prepared to get choked up with &quot;You're Missing&quot;).  <BR>      The sound of the E-Streeters is unmistakable, vintage Springsteen.  Some of the tunes (e.g. Mary's Place) could have jumped right out of the Thunder Road era.<BR>      Here's hoping that the Boss is back for good.
B000069HKH|5.0|The music and the words took me back to that day in September,  He sings about sacrifice, loss, coping, and hope for the future.  The songs are powerful.  The album is just that an album they all work together every song is a piece of the story, an emotion, and a time.  I hope this is just the first of the new records to come from Bruce, he has allot to say and I think he is worth listening to.
0140131558|2.0|I might be ignorant, but this book didn't appeal to me at all. I read it during my summer holidays, and it wasn't bad entertainment. However, I don't like the plot of the three stories, and especially City of Glass is a bit too &quot;pseudo&quot;. Some passages are like reading Umberto Eco, but without his brilliance and more important without importance to me as the reader!<BR>I rate this book 2 stars; 1 for Auster's writing, which (without doubt) is good ,and 1 for his description of New York. I've never had the pleasure to visit the city, but in this book it comes alive.<BR>My conclusion will be: If you want mystery novels stick to Raymond Chandler, and if you want the rest stick to Umberto Eco ;-)
B000069HKH|5.0|When terrible things strike the lives of everyday people, humanity reacts in a relatively predictable and understandable manner: shock, grief, and sorrow gently ebb into pools of anger, defiance, and resolve. These too evolve endlessly, until we are left with either bitter cynicism or newfound faith and hope. Bruce Springsteen has been a voice for hope and faith in times of struggle for nearly 30 years, and perhaps we need that voice now more than ever.<br />On the morning of September 11, Mr. Springsteen recalls running to a bridge over the Jersey side, the Magic Rat staring into the fires of Jungleland, his city in ruins. One can imagine that he knew even then that eventually, this album was coming.<br />Come it has, and it brings the return of the mighty E Street Band, back with their old swagger, but slightly tempered by age and circumstance. Ultimately these 15 songs are grounded in the spaces that Bruce Springsteen has always known - hope, faith, redemption, defiance against tragedy and picking up the pieces after loss. It occurs to me that we have lost not only the pre-9/11 everything, but also that small window of grace and humanity that shone so brightly in the months following that day. It was as if when those towers fell, so did all of our alienating American tendencies. It seems easy to believe that we as Americans have never felt closer, more united, more as a family living in a place without regard to sex, age, race or nation, than we did on the morning of September 12. In the past months, that too has been lost, and 'The Rising' echoes that loss as much as any other. This is echoed in \\"Nothing Man,\\" a story told from the perspective of a rescuer who survived the ordeal intact (physically, at least):<br />\\"Around here, everybody acts the same / Around here, everybody acts like nothing's changed / Friday night, the club meets at Al's barbecue / The sky's still, the same unbelievable blue\\"<br />\\"Into the Fire\\" is an early highlight of this release, withthe powerful voice of one saved by a fireman, only to see him turn and head back into the inferno, towards others in need, towards his own grave.<br />\\"May your strength give us strength / may your faith give us faith / may your hope give us hope / may your love bring us love\\"<br />This very simple anthem somehow works, so much so that it may well be the emotional centerpiece of an album soaked with the blood of human loss. Other pieces explore the uncertain journeys many found themselves on in the late autumn of 2001. In \\"Empty Sky\\" Mr. Springsteen seems to be on that sojourn, spinning through spaces where loss and longing dance with yearnings for revenge:<br />\\"I woke up this morning / I could barely breathe / Just an empty impression / In the bed where you used to be / I want a kiss from your lips / I want an eye for an eye\\"<br />The image of a river has flowed through many of Mr. Springsteen's finest works throughout the years, and it has served as a reminder that life itself is fluid. The river is always there to carry us towards a new life of hope and redemption. Its' waters are ever-present to cleanse us, it's life inherent to our sustanence. Now we find the sky above us as a new symbol for life and grief, permeating through \\"The Rising\\" not only as it's own entity, but also for the missing pieces of a city that used to reach skyward. On the title track he sings:<br />\\"Sky of memory and shadow / Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight / Sky of longing and emptiness / Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life / Come on up for the rising tonight\\"<br />These are, without question, E Street songs, but like every American, Mr. Springsteen and his stalwart band are different beings now. The rollicking \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" recalls the old joy and romp of the classic rockabilly anthem \\"Out in the Street\\" from 1980's double LP The River, but one senses something held back. The pure, unbridled joy, the freedom, the innocence, is gone. When Mr. Springsteen sings \\"everything will be okay,\\" we believe him, but this the hope found rising from tragedy, and that has a very different flavor.<br />This is an elegy for American innocence. <br />But while that innocence may be gone as assuredly as the 3,000 lives lost that sunny September morning, Mr. Springsteen has once again reminded us that from the darkest pits of our despair, hope still shines. There was, is, and will always be the chance to build again, to rise up with the help of our neighbors, and stand tall. Mr. Springsteen cemented his role as America's musical poet-laureate when he opened the \\"Tribute to Heroes\\" telethon with a soul-grippingly powerful performance of \\"My City of Ruins.\\" He took us into his arms at that moment and gave us hope, a clean and shining moment of light when our world was one of darkness. Pete Townsend once referred to Bruce Springsteen as \\"our fearless leader.\\"<br />Indeed, and thankfully so.
B000069CWE|5.0|I am so surprised that many songs have new melodies and lyrics.<BR>I think LP successfully break the music boundary.My favorite songs are PTS.OF.ATHRTY,ENTH E ND,and MY DECEMBER.If you're a LP fan,you must have this one!
0394298381|3.0|Mr. McCromick is indeed a great motivational writer/ speaker, but in this book, there is no new information that one doesn't already have by using common sense. No disrespect to Mark but they probably don't teach common-sense at Harvard Business School because there is a great possibility that the guys who make it to HBS already possess enough of it.
0805053883|3.0|What I had expected in this book was the onomatopoeia (\\"buzz\\", \\"meow\\", etc.) that is usual to other books about animal noises.<br />Although this book used some familiar terms, many of the terms for animal sounds were confusing to my daughter. For example, I had a difficult time explaining what \\"fluting\\" might sound like, since I really don't know what a flamingo sounds like (I live in the frozen Midwest). It's also hard to explain \\"trumpeting\\" to someone who doesn't know or understand what a trumpet is.<br />The text flows beautifully, the repetition is soothing to little ears and Eric Carle's illustrations are always a treat. Despite this, I can't recommend this book as highly as some other reviewers have.<br />I know that my disappointment stems from the fact that I had planned to use this book to explain the sounds that some exotic animals make. I really don't need this book just for the repetition and poetry, I think that the \\"Brown Bear...\\" book by the same team does a better job at that task.
B00005QDW1|4.0|underneath it all, hella good, making out, rock steady, and running.
B00005JL3A|5.0|So there are a lot of you who are very critical of this movie. That it wasn't an accurate portrail of (in my opinion) the greatest video game series ever, sans Final Fantasy. I throughly enjoyed this movie. It has a great premise, even though it's not based directly on one of the games. But I believe that Paul W.S. Anderson did an amazing job on this movie. The casting was outstanding, to say the least. You can't ask for anything more than for an actor to truly love what they are doing, and both the amazing Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez love the game. One of the greatest things about this DVD is the commentery by Anderson, Jovovich, Rodriguez, and Bolt. I've watched it about 5 times already. I truly hope there is a sequel to this movie because I really loved it and I'm looking forward to seeing how Anderson incorporates the characters from this film with the characters from the actual game. So go out and get this DVD now, you will not be disappointed.
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book - it was so different than anything I've read before - the whole idea of a young girl writing about her murder from heaven.  It was heartbreaking, funny, warm, so many things. I would highly recommend it.
B000069HKH|5.0|As I write this I am listening to this CD for the umpteenth time.  This album is Bruce at his best.  Perhaps it is the E Street Band that brings it out of him, but this is his best album since the River.  I was worried that all of the songs would be somber and depressing, like Nebraska or the Ghost of Tom Joad, but from Lonesome Day to Mary's Place, there is enough uplifting, fun, music to balance out the more darker edged songs.  My personal favorite song on the album is the title track, the Rising.  To me it is the perfect blend of tribute to the tragedy of 9/11, and a song of hope and triumph of the human spirit to overcome such huge obsticales.  <br />On a musical note, the band has never sounded better.  This is the first studio album that both Steven and Nils worked on together.  Quite honestly they sound amazing.  Roy and Danny help to add depth to the music that is just incredible.  Max once again shows the world why the people at the Conan O'Brein show were brilliant to hire him.  Gary and Patti are great as well.  And what can be said about Clarence that hasn't been said already, he IS the Big Man.  Without him the band would be flat.<br />This is the best album of the year.  No doubt in my mind.  Do yourself a favor and get it.
0316666343|2.0|After reading all the hype of this book, I was very excited to dive into something worthwhile.  After getting through 1/2 of the book, I was extremely disappointed and bored. I just had to finish the book since I already made it that far plus I was curious to see how all the loose ends would be resolved. Needless to say I was not satisfied with how everything ended. The author ended everything on a positive note.  Yet I didn't feel justice was served and the murderer got away easy, compared to what Susie went through on Earth and goes through in Heaven. If you are looking for a exciting read and feel good read, this isn't the book for you.

B000069CWE|5.0|When I first heard that Linkin Park's new album was going to be a remix album (at the beginning of this year) I was a little PO'ed, to say the least. Don't get me wrong, I love Linkin Park with all my heart, but you do have to admit they were turning into a bit of a sell-out. And with a remix album as their second album? But then I listened to PTS.OF.ATHRTY and H! VLTG3 (which, by the way, is a remix of the remix) on their site, and realized how much different a remix could be. I got the album the day it came out, but at first it was a little disappointing. I really wish I could say I liked the remix of In the End (ENTH E ND), but then I'd be lying. But as I listened more and more, I found myself getting hooked on the new styles and new lyrics. The highlights are, by far, the last two tracks (1STP KLOSR with Jonathan Davis from KoRn and KRWLNG with Aaron Lewis from Staind), but most of the album after track 5 is good. The bonus features are just the PTS.OF.ATHRTY video (very, very cool) and a &quot;Website Toolkit&quot; with a bunch of images and links to help with the creation of a LP fansite. All in all, if you liked their first album, or their old, pre-Linkin Park stuff, you'll love this. If you don't like LP, then you won't like this, which makes sense I guess... God Bless!
0316666343|5.0|Lovely Bones is without a doubt the best novel I have ever read. The characters, plot, the time-line, and the ending is written so well. You actually feel the emotions as you read this story. I would highly suggest this novel for anyone looking for a different take on reading about something as brutual as murder, rape, and deception and finding meaning in the story surrounding this family. A truly excellent read!!!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I am a huge fan of the books and I don't think this movie lives up to them. I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, it's not, I'm just saying that there were things in the book that just couldn't be expressed on screen. It was a great movie, but there were so many changes from the book (and I do understand that there was a time limit on the movie)that I felt that you had to of read the book to understand what was going on in the movie. Although that isn't a problem for me, I had dragged my friends to see it and all I did the whole time was try to explain what was happening to them. I do believe though that the actors in the movie did an incredible job portraying their characters and conveying the central feeling of the story.<br />On the dvd I liked the games you could play to get to the deleted scenes, they give a very fun spin to the whole thing.<br />I know the name of my review is weird, it means this:<BR>Putting a puzzle together is fun so you can see the whole picture at the end, but this movie is a puzzle that decided to put itself together and although it's almost complete and put together in the correct order there are some pieces that are missing and some that aren't even from this puzzle that are trying to get in, in all the wrong places, and the only thing you can do is yell at them and tell them what goes where and what shouldn't be there. Confusing? I know, it is isn't it?<BR>-tim
B000065V3H|4.0|Wow, hearing about this movie reminds me of wonderful memories back in the 80s when I was a teen. I couldn't resist not writing a review.<br />Let me put it this way, it's a teen story version of \\"Indecent Proposal\\". Of course the two movies are very different and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is extremely innocent movie compared to \\"Indecent Proposal\\" but still there is a thin line that matches between them... the use of money to buy love!<br />Amanda Peterson was incredibly sexy in that movie... she was HOT!<br />Loved the story, loved the innocense, loved the music & of course the lovely Amanda Peterson!

0871137380|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a magnificent work depicting the Battle of Mogadishu. Many war books/films loose their focus in an attempt to properly develop characters or to give the scope of the bigger conflict. <BR>The major criticism of the movie was that it was nothing but war and no underlying story. In the book Bowden's skill as a writer provides a story and excellent character development. <BR>This a great book for anyone interested in special ops or the Battle of Mogadishu. It is also a great read for anyone who is not a big reader because it is so exciting the text pulls the reader through the book
B000065V3H|5.0|This is a wonderful family movie, about coming of age and not being the most popular kid in school.  Ronald has a scheme to get himself into the \\"A\\" crowd, when he pays the head cheerleader to act like his girlfriend.  The story is very good with many lessons learned.  It is very family friendly, and I have seen it a good 25-30 times and still don't get board.  There are not enough good family friendly movies out there but this is one of them.  Buy and enjoy over and over again.
B00000K0DT|5.0|What earns a film the characterisation \\"classic\\"? First and foremost a great script. Check, then. The \\"Usual Suspects\\" has the definition of a great script. It keeps you guessing until literally the very last minute when it leaves you in awe. Story twists and state-of-the-art mind games are dominant throughout while parts of the story could actually be separate films alltogether. A big heist involving 5 former convicts, a mysterious underground lord called \\"Keyser Sose\\", and the story being told in retrospect by \\"Verbal\\" (Kevin Spacey), a cripple who is interrogated by a top cop (Palminteri) is the basic outline.<BR>    As you try to make sense out of what \\"verbal\\" says (while the \\"facts\\" keep constantly changing and \\"verbal\\" keeps adjusting his story according to the new clues coming in) the mind game keeps climaxing and the myth about Keyser Sose elevates to incredible manipulations. In fact, the basic theme of the film is \\"who is Keyser Sose\\"? And, exactly because \\"Keyser\\" could be any of a number of \\"suspects\\", he could be dead, or he might not even exist the intrigue remains intact till the end.<BR>    And what an end this is. Possibly one of the most ingenius film-endings ever on celluloid, one not to give away if you are a true fan of the \\"Usual suspects\\" or a true fan of cinema.<BR>    But the positives don't stop there. Kevin Spacey doesn't simply give yet another solid performance, he gives a trademark performance, one that many a character have since been based-on on film and doubtlessly more are to follow as the character of \\"Verbal\\" is sharply inspiring.<BR>    But then every character in the film has dynamic abilities, every character contributes as a corridor to the endless labyrinth of clues you are trying to collect as you watch. Gabriel Byrne and Del Toro, Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollack as well as Palminteri are all in superb form here. The second time I watched this film it became very obvious that all the actors loved being in this stunning flick. No wonder.<BR>   The director falls not short either, he lets the characters lead and he does his part in setting up the scenery where the elusive Keyser Sose can \\"exist\\". A scenery dark and intimidating like the character in question. The main element is the fear everyone seems to out over \\"Sose\\" but at the same time noone knows for sure what he does or what he is.<BR>    The most clues are given, perhaps, by Keyser's \\"right hand\\" the enigmatic \\"Mr. Kobayashi\\" who serves also as a guide to Sose's power for the viewers.<BR>    Mindblowing film. Puts the \\"C\\" into classic.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is a great CD.  The mix of hard rock and mysterious guitar are great.  I went to their concert and I was just blown away.
B000002UCN|4.0|I must confess to loving George's Beatles tracks. He was also the most consistent of the ex-Beatles with his solo albums containing very little in the way of filler and many quality tracks per album. This selection, however is something of an oddity. George's work can be split into three clear sections, and this album straddles them awkwardly.<br />His work with the Beatles is great, but couldn't we have made a whole disc of this? Where is the ecstatic Blue Jay Way? Where is Old Brown Shoe? Where are his great vocal covers such as Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby? And even George's guitar solos could have been showcased such as his last Beatles work on Free As A Bird. Having said that, Something, Here Comes the Sun, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps are songs that made such an impact they have a life outside the context of the Beatles and really give the listener the idea of Harrison the songwriter developing his art.<br />The second phase of Harrison's work was with his Apple albums. As we might expect, My Sweet Lord is here, but only one track each from Living in the Material World and Extra Texture.<br />The third phase is George's Dark Horse releases and the gravest omissions here come from this time. Blow Away, Got My Mind Set On You, Lennon tribute  All Those Years Ago and Beatles lampoon When We Was Fab are all notable by their absence.<br />OK, the compilers seem to be spoiled for choice, and everything here is great, but perhaps it isn't an overstatement to say that an artist as prolific as George deserved a two or even three disc set. And it isn't really excusable to leave out a number two hit single (Got My Mind Set On You).<br />So, 5/5 for the material, 3/5 for the selection, averaging out at 4/5.
B000001EQT|5.0|Incredibly sexy, slick, hard-rocking production.  I just love the contrast of that crunchy Les Paul against the sweet, vibrant orchestral strings, serving as a stirring backdrop for Marc Bolan's sassy, smooth vocals.
B00005RRG9|5.0|The original version of &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; is definitely my favorite Disney movie ever and it is also pretty high on my favorite movies of all time list. This is a cute movie about a pair of twins (both played by Hayley Mills) whose parents were divorced shortly after they were born. They were split up and never knew the other existed. Then one year they were both sent to the same summer camp, where they met and discovered what happened, so they decided to switch places in order to bring their parents back together. <br />Hayley Mills does a great job playing two different characters. You have to understand that this is a pioneering film. The idea of one actor playing the parts of the two main characters was unheard of at the time this movie was made. With the technology we have today, this is a much easier process than it was 40 years ago. There was a lot of tricky camera work involved here. In fact, if you look closely, you can see a couple of times where an arm or a hand or something gets cut off because Hayley Mills went past the imaginary line in the middle of the screen.<br />There are lots of special features on this new DVD to make it worth buying. The second disc is full of documentaries with background information on the making of the film. <br />This is a great family movie. It can be enjoyed by both children and adults. I would recommend it to anyone I know, no matter what type of movies they like.
B000002OZY|5.0|I just recently went out and purchased a re-mastered version of the original Kit Lambert studio recording, of TOMMY, on CD. It says it has been remastered by Bob Ludwig, reissue produced by Jon Astley. It is absolutuely delightful and very crisp sounding. You just close your eyes and you feel like you are in the recording studio. I really think this particular recording probably exemplifies what is really great about THE WHO: very honest, tight, loud, unpretentious, uncomplicated, visceral rock music...... Now I really like the later material too.. but the synthesizer, while fantastic in its effect, can obscure the band's true genius... On this recoding, you here the boys without<BR>any additional effects... <br />I really think that the degree of ongoing interest in THE WHO is not just a nostalgia thing, but a sign that there do not appear to be any other bands out there today that really understand how to effectively work with the formula THE WHO perfected. <br />TOMMY, by THE WHO, does NOT sound dated, it sounds GREAT, clear and fresh, like it was recorded last month, for today's audience.
B000069CWE|2.0|I love Linkin Park, and I'm sure you do too, but wake up man! This CD is complety overdone on a disgusting use of techno. Linkin Park is destroying there reputation on a complete remake of the amazing Hybrid Theory, which is the only album I can recall that every track on it was good. Linkin Park is my favorite band, but their new CD is not. Now you may think I only favor one genre, that not true, I like some forms of punk and metal. Linkin Park claims they are a Hybrid, I claim they are best off staying in rock where they prosper. Linkin Park is too good to invite inferior groups into their CD and reputation. I was shocked when I bought the CD, but it dawned on me, the only thing they are reanimating is there reputation. All I can say is, it is time for fresh new songs. I really can't redirect you to any other CD's because LP is so new. In my opinion listen to your second favorite band until they come out with a new album with the spirit of Hybid Theory and essence of improvement.
0385335482|5.0|This book is wonderfully written. It is among the few books I couldn't put down. I'm sure that people will love this book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|In this movie, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreger play a courtesan and a writer. In the Moulin Rouge dance scene Satine (Nicole Kidman) mistakes Christian (Ewan McGreger) and the Duke. Now both the real Duke and Christian have appointments to see Satine after her number (Sparkling Diamonds) in an elephant (not a real elephant, by the way). But as fate may have it, Christian gets there first, while Satine still thinks that Charistian is the Duke. So she tries to suduce him (you see, in order for Moulin Rouge not to shut down, Satine must sleep with the Duke). I won't tell you more of the story but the movie is wonderful, those who have not seen it must go out and see the movie.
B000069CWE|4.0|Im a huge Linkin Park fan, always have been, so you can bet that I know all the songs by heart (including non Hybrid Theory songs). After I listened to Reanimation, I was presently surprised after noticing how much effort was put into the CD. Not only are [most] of the remixes very different from the original songs, but some have even changed so drastically that it's pretty much a whole new song (not always a good thing). For example, &quot;Frgt/10&quot; is much more of a rap song now than a rock song, which is refreshing and dissapointing at the same time. &quot;Bi Myslf&quot; is also much different from the original song, however, it's much much better :). And yes, Linkin Park contributed to remixing the songs, so you don't have to worry about hearing the same things that you heard from Hybrid Theory (most of the time, anyway). Lots of new lyrics, and lots of things done VERY differently, and at times it can be very impressive. Reanimation is easily the best remix album I've ever heard.  <br />If your a Linkin Park fan, than you obviously need to own this cd. Although it sounds a bit too familiar here and there, and some of the remixes can be dissapointing (such as the Points of Authority Remix), theres easily enough here to satisfy any LP fan. It's a good refresher while we wait for Linkin Park's next album. which will be out later this year :).
B000069CWE|1.0|If ur gonna buy a cd buy Linkin parks Hybrid Theory reanimation is a poor version of hybrid theory ill give it 2 stars beacause it has 2 good songs and because ive liked Linkin Park in the past my reccomendation is too buy hybrid theory or wait for their next album.
0060012331|5.0|I don't agree with the Reading Level assigned to this book (ages 9-12). Sure, 9-12 year olds could read it without problem. But, it's not a really a kid's book. It's just a very, very good book that's fun and light to read. It's also almost entirely independent of any need for prior knowledge of the Discworld. At a guess, I'd assign it a place just after \\"Moving Pictures\\" (purely based on the \\"Gaspode-the-Wonder-Dog\\" affect plus the fact that Maurice is mentioned twice in \\"Reaper Man\\" (which comes just after \\"Moving Pictures\\")). It's definitely a book to read. Anyone CAN read it and everyone SHOULD read it.
0312265859|5.0|I loved this book. As A die hard Stephanie Plum fan, I was sorely disappointed with book 7, and think Book 8 was a nice recovery.<br />Stephanie is helping out a neighbor in this story. It was interesting to see the character changing. This story more prominently featured Ranger, one of my favorite Plum characters.  We finally see Steph get  serious with her handgun, and there's classic \\"only Stephanie\\" situations, such as being attacked by a flock of geese over a box of CrackerJacks.<br />I found myself laughing aloud and am anticipating next summer, when the adventure continues....
B00000GBHA|5.0|When I was 17 a girl gave me a mix tape. She was South African, and there was some really interesting stuff on it. The most immediately stunning track was a song from this album called \\"I Wonder\\".<BR>  This is one of the best albums ever, no two ways about it. Please buy this, it's so cheap, really. Do you really want to wait for a chance encounter with a South African? Do yourself a favour. I wish I could rate this higher.
B000069HKH|5.0|bruce and the e-street band are back and doing it better than ever.  this album is packed full with songs that will inevitably become classics.
B000063UR2|5.0|I snatched this one up the milli-second it became available - one of my alltime,favorite movies in any genre,EVER. It makes me want to run outside and check the bushes in the backyard for fairies and pixies. :)<BR>I was thrilled to be able to see Ridley Scott's original cut, with the orignal score. Although the Tangerine Dream score remains my favorite, there were some really cute scenes cut out. Tons of wonderful interviews and behind-the-scenes, too.<BR>The cast is headlined by the always superb Tim Curry - even in the most eye popping makeup, his talents still stand out and chill me as he revels in his role as Darkness. Tom Cruise as Jack and Mia Sara as Lily display a love for each other onscreen that still gives me a little lump in my throat every time - it's that love that we all hope for, endless, powerful, pure. <BR>The overall message: no one is perfect - we are all a little innocent, a little wicked, a devil, a princess, a hero. I watch this movie to remind myself to look for the all the love and magic in the world.
B000068TPN|5.0|The bottom line here is simple: This movie is extremely well done, and Mel Gibson (along with the majority of the other actors) does an incredible acting job. This is one of the most realistic portrayals of warfare on a battlefield-level that I have seen in a while.<br />Most of this movie is the brutal neverending Ia Drang Valley battle between American and Vietnamese forces. With bullets whizzing, soldiers screaming, and choppers flying overhead you feel as if the only thing missing is the smell of the gunpowder. However, when the movie switches to show the families back home and their lives, it is capable of exceptionally emotional and very touching moments. The transition between such scenes is very well done. You don't find yourself watching an adrenaline-pumping scene and suddenly switch over to a scene of a sobbing wife. Instead, it naturally takes you through the peaks and lulls of emotion and you never find yourself being taken off-guard.<br />The end result is an excellent movie that has definite replay value. I plan on adding it to my personal collection.
B000002C4J|5.0|This CD has something for everyone... Well, I should say it has something for everyone who isn't a &quot;HATER.&quot;  It's reality people so find a way too deal with it.  YES! CELINE HAS THE GREATEST VOICE IN THE WORLD...  When you write imbecilic, disrespectful and hate filled reviews, you only show how vapid and provincial you are.  Please, don't come on the board and embarrass yourself and others with your mindless drivel.  To those who understand great talent and enjoy wonderful music, treat yourself and get this CD...
0451523938|5.0|It seems curious that the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde should still hold such a fascination for modern readers. It cannot work very well as a mystery story, since most of us already know the secret of the book, that one character transforms bodily into the other. (Nor is Mr. Hyde a straightforward horror monster - he is capable of vaguely civil conversation.) This short tale unfolds in a somewhat disjointed series of vignettes, as a certain lawyer grasps various strands of the mystery of Dr. Jekyll through chance encounters and legal documents. For all these possible flaws, the concept of the book goes straight to the reader's imagination and also to the conscience. Hyde is the evil within all people, and who among us cannot identify on some level with him, and fear him all the more? Who among us has not in some fashion struggled for our better natures as Jekyll has? The concept is brilliant, and timeless. For this reason, the book remains as absorbing as ever. (Incidentally, the introduction to the \\"mass market paperback\\" edition by Vladimir Nabokov consists largely of a summary of the book's plot, and is thus of limited value.)
B00005JL3A|4.0|Resident Evil is one of those films that I said, \\"Ah, I'll wait until it gets to video to see it.\\"  I didn't expect it to be any good - not really.  How could it be?  It is based on a video game.  Now, I actually liked Mortal Kombat, which is also based on a video game (it wasn't great, but it was fun) - and I didn't know that the same director was responsible for it.  So, I was expecting the worst.  I was wrong.<br />As someone completely unfamiliar with the video game on which the film is based, I didn't know what to expect.  In short, Resident Evil is about a group of \\"security\\" personnel who work for a huge conglomerate that is doing all sorts of research - some of it suspect.  One of their more sinister viruses is released and they must go into the secret facility where it is created to try to fix things.  Little do they know that they will be facing all sorts of creepy security devices and ... zombies.<br />Milla Jovovich is the female lead and she manages to carry the film well.  I'm really not that informed on her background, but I will say that while she probably doesn't have a great depth of talent at her disposal, she is a capable actress and I liked her in her role.  To say that she was believable would be impossible, as I don't know that such a person could exist (how many zombie fighters do you know?).<br />Sadly, the men in this film are almost interchangeable.  I really didn't know who was who until names started getting fired off and I actually bothered to pay attention.  They all sort of look the same.  There are two other women in the film too, and I didn't realize it until one of them gets injured - they look the same as well.<br />The interesting thing in this sci-fi/horror film is that the horror aspects were not the ones I found frightening.  It was the sci-fi stuff.  The whole zombie aspect seems to be ground better covered by George Romero in Dawn of the Dead.  In fact, the zombie mythos seems to be taken directly from Romero's film:  they move slowly, they look terrible, and they eat flesh of the living.  If you get bitten, scratched, etc. by one of the undead, you, too, will become one of the undead.<br />The sci-fi angle worked better for me (and I don't really like sci-fi).  I found the security devices and the assorted set pieces to be very intimidating and frightening.  I definitely was feeling the suspense.<br />Part of the fun for me was that I DIDN'T know about the video game.  Why? I didn't know what was going on.  The beginning of the film was very confusing as I didn't understand what was happening or why it was happening.  Fortunately, the screenwriters did a very good job of having a few of the characters actually explain the subject to me - and it was done well - as a few of the other characters were designed to be as confused as I was.<br />The script, the sets, the make-up, and the actors made this a very enjoyably scary film.  I actually recommend it and give it four stars when compared with other films of this genre.<br />The DVD extra features are rather standard and I didn't avail myself of all of them.  However, as DVD extras become the norm, I think we'll see more and more added features for big budget films and more of the \\"standard fare\\" extras, such as these, offered:  Director and actor commentary, subtitles, music video, biographies of the actors, etc.<br />Have yourself a good scare and watch this film.
B000069CWE|5.0|This CD is remixes and a few new songs of Linkin Park. It is a great CD without a bad song on it. 61 minutes of the greatest music ever!! If you liked the first one, you'll love this one. It plays like one really long song that is great and you dont want it to stop.
B000067JHW|5.0|Amalie is the enchanting story of a young Parisian woman who lives a rather solitary, introspective life. Gradually, however, she starts meddling in the lives of her neighbors and co-workers and finds that she loves doing it. She becomes fascinated by a man who collects discarded instant-photos in the train station and, with the use of some clever photos of herself, they fall love.<br /><br />The thing that makes Amalie so utterly irresistible is the script: Amalie talks directly to the audience and shares her candid thoughts throughout the movie. She is funny and clever. The star, Audrey Tatou, reminds you instantly of Audrey Hepburn. She is petite, perky, and has her own style. She is simply adorable. I saw it twice and I'm going to get the video. I enjoyed hearing the beautiful French spoken in the film; it added to the film, making it seem lighter and more joyous.  Amalie makes life seem wonderful!
B00000IAU3|1.0|This is the worst CD I've bought in years. Only good song is track 6 &quot;Thank You&quot;, which should really be entitled &quot;Thank You for buying my CD even though there is only one good song&quot;. The recording of this CD is horrible. It sounds like they tried  something new but it just makes her voice sound like cr@p. Don't waste your money, like I did, just because you heard one good song on the radio!
B00005OWEG|5.0|'Redux' brings to life the greatest war story of this generation in a completely new perspective.  Copolla captured the insanity of Veitnam in a way that no other filmaker has.  20+ years since the original was released, I am still engrossed in this film and its story.  This is not a film about Veitnam in the traditional sense.  If you want that, go see Oliver Stone's Platoon (with all of the typical Oliver Stone sensationalism) or Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (which doesn't even look like Veitnam).  This is a film about a man's (in)sanity (Captain Willard played by Martin Sheen) delivered through the horror of Veitnam as he pursues the renegade Colnel Kurtz (Brando).<br />'Redux' adds nearly an hour of extra footage which gives more depth to the already epic film.  The French Plantation sequence (nearly 30 minutes long) is the real highlight of the new footage.  This is an elaborate series of scenes with completely new faces (including Aurore Clemente).  Considering all that went into these scenes, it is difficult to imagine how this was omitted from the final cut of the original.  But, in an effort to get the original under 2 1/2 hours, it was cut.  The only hint that anyone had of Copolla's mysterious French Plantation Scene was in the 'Hearts of Darkness' documentary released several years ago.  The extended sequence of scenes with Kurtz at the end is an additional highlight on 'Redux' along with a haunting new soundtrack.<br />The story doesn't change, however, and neither does the importance of this epic film.  Copolla explores the depravity of one man's mind during the horror of Vietnam.  Apocalypse Now takes such a different angle from any other war film of its era.  There is no hero in this war, as illustrated by Willard.  Copolla nearly lost his own mind (and his fortune) during the filming of Apocalypse Now (see 'Hearts of Darkness').  The result is as magnificent today as it was 20 years ago.  <br />In watching 'Redux', it is difficult to determine when the film was made.  The cinematography is unmatched and the attention to detail is witnessed in every scene.  This film is a 'must see' and a 'must have' .  The only real let down is the absense of any bonus material on the DVD.  I would have gladly paid extra for any extras that might have been appropriate.
0380789035|1.0|The book starts out with the anticipation that this will be an entertaining read but after the first five pages, it falls apart and doesn't capture the reader again until the last four pages.  Everything else between the beginning and end are just words to take up space and add thickness between the covers.<br />Character development is practically non-existent and most of the characters are really just a profusion of names that only make the theme of the book distracting and chaotic.  It is not clearly and understandably recognized that the name of the character Wednesday derived itself from the Norse word 'Wodinstag' which was the day honoring the Norse god Wodin (or Odin).<br />The book rambles from page to page without any continuity of meaning about the idea of what the author is presenting and each page becomes a struggle to finish.<br />In summary, the author was certainly not thinking of what the reader would like to enjoy.
B000000H4V|4.0|Brazilian band Sepultura reached the end f a phase with ARISE. Nwo they had to change, and a great change in the fantastic CHAOS A.D!! Great album!! Even MAx vocals are more bearable here!
B000068PQ0|2.0|It's sad to say, but although the Flaming Lips last 2 regular length albums are very Dreamy, Echoey, and Well-produced, they fall far short of the southern-noise rock gold that encompassed albums like Clouds Taste Metalic, Hit To Death In The Future Head, Transmissions From The Satelite Heart, and In A Priest Driven Ambulance. Through sharpening up their studio finesse, it seems they may have lost touch with that simple, grungy, happy/sad sound that so many had come to love. This album isn't a BAD album per se,it soars in production, but falls flat on its face in plain old fun.
B000069HKH|5.0|In his earlier incarnation, Bruce Springsteen believed in the magical power of rock and roll.  The majesty of \\"Born to Run\\" and the epic \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" served as a reminder of how rock and roll could save mankind, one song at a time.  It was an idealistic belief, full of youthful exuberance, and when that youth grew up, he turned inward, plaintive, and retreated from rock and roll into the hushed tones of \\"Tunnel of Love\\" and \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad.\\"  He delivered expert adult contemporary pop songs and went on tour, but he ceased to be the troubadour of the common man, instead choosing mostly to remain silent.  <br />Until now.  \\"The Rising\\" isn't just the best thing to hit American rock in a decade-it is the triumphant exclamation of the redemptive power of rock and roll, the expression of a faith in rock to transcend a compact disc and change the world.  From its opening, triumphant layered guitar strokes to its gospel-influenced choruses, the album oozes with the self-confidence that comes with being in the business of true rock and roll.  This isn't just an album or a group of songs-for Bruce Springsteen, it's a religious experience, a transformative work of a preacher getting ready to deliver yet another titanic sermon.  Which is exactly what it is.  <br />It is also a statement that requires many, many listens before subtleties begin to emerge.  Obviously, the work is the product of its times, but it is never restricted to those times.  Springsteen is painting wide, broad strokes that will live past memories of September.  He is working in the language of allegory and the vagueness of universality.  If the lyrics aren't as emotive and wrapped with wordplay as they were 25 years ago, they achieve a deeper, more immediate connection through their direct plaintiveness.  The lyrical highlights include the brilliant \\"Nothing Man,\\" \\"Paradise,\\" and \\"You're Missing,\\" the album's three dark, tearful ballads.  <br />The true extraordinary moment, however, comes with \\"Worlds Apart.\\"  Springsteen fuses languages and cultures in a momentous statement of idealism where the worlds of East and West come together in lyric and song.  It is a song, appropriately, about love, companionship, and a desire not to be alone.  The album takes its inspiration not in death but in life.  Musically, the E Streeters are back, although there are less of those distinctively classic E Street moments.  It doesn't matter.  This incarnation of the band can still rock, especially with the reconfigured three guitar line-up, backed by the always powerful Max Weinberg and the beautiful organs and keyboards of Danny Federici and Roy Bittan.  It's also an album of immense range-Springsteen channels American popular music in all its forms, from folk and country to rock and pop, to deliver an eclectic set of tunes, each one unique, different, and beautiful.  <br />In the end, Springsteen uses the language of America in creating an album full of redemptive hope and spirit.  It is a celebration, a celebration of heroism, of love, of sorrow, of sadness, of life itself, in all its complex glory.  It's a clarion call to rise up, to live, to breathe, to love, and to cherish, delivered from a preacher coming back to the pulpit to deliver one more shout to the crowd.  Twenty-five years ago, Bruce Springsteen saved rock and roll.  He just might do it again.
B00006F7IM|5.0|Major League is my favorite baseball movie ever, and it's been ticking me off for the longest time that it wasn't available on DVD where as the lesser sequals were. I just hope there are extra scenes included, given we've waited this long. I still remember the trailer and want to see the scene that included the lines \\"That ball wouldn't have been out of most parks.\\" \\"Name one.\\" \\"Yellowstone.\\" Why they cut that out I will NEVER know.<BR>Very hyped am I:)
B00005OAIE|4.0|I've noticed so many reviews compare John to Dave Mathews. ... seems myopic.  Why stop there?   So many good influences ... try Michael Franks, America, Steely Dan, Sting, Keb Mo, a flicker or two of SRV, maybe an afternoon with Cecilia (Simon and Garfunkel, Body is a Wonderland).   He even throws in thanks to Mike McDonald.  One should do so poorly as to hang out with the likes of these.  <br />For a 40-something who's turned a desperate ear to the radio for anything to listen to, John came and saved the day.  So what he is obsessed about his lunchbox and the lyrics don't always work. The point is still made ... &quot;I'd plot a course to the source of the purest little part of me&quot; ... all while managing to play tunes with more than 3 chords in a major key ... amazing!<br />Could we hope that a 20-30 year career awaits and James Taylor has a successor to the singer-songwriter throne. Well done Mr. Quarter-Life Crisis.
B000069HKH|5.0|There are 2 types of people in this world.  Those who put everyone into one of two categories and those who don't.  Likewise, there are 2 types of Springsteen albums.  The Great and the Good.  The Great albums are those which run from Born to Run to Tunnel of Love.  The Good albums are the rest.  (Perhaps a truly honest Springsteen fan would admit that there should be a third category of Truly Awful for Human Touch).<br />This album deserves to scrape into the Great albums category.  Of course Springsteen has a problem.  Usually he has experienced the emotions expressed on his albums or grown up with people who have felt them.  However for this album he has had to take time to talk with widows and other second-hand victims of September 11th in order to try to learn how they feel.  His language is therefore poetic and effective but not as raw as in the rest of his Great albums.<br />Nevertheless, this remains a strong album lyrically.  Musically it is as good as most which he has done and better than many.<br />Springsteen has travelled thousands and thousands of miles just to get here.  He came with a purpose.  He came with a mission.  A great album which works musically, lyrically and which rocks.  Welcome back, Glory Days.
B000069HKH|5.0|If your looking for the old sound of Bruce and the E-Street Band u may be disappointed .. but this album is just as good.  The album has less of the dual keyboards and more violin.  The songs are strong and much better than his last album the Ghost of Tom Joad.  Hopefully bruce will not splite from the E-Street band again!
B000069CWE|5.0|This is absolutely my best album purchase of the year so far.  I loved &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and like this interpretation compilation as much, if not more.  Even on my first listening, I am in love with it.  It's got a great mix of styles - from hip hop to a little old-school alternative to a &quot;Gladiator&quot; soundtrack-style opening.  Fan-freakin'-tastic!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's third album sounds better and better as time has past. It has been five years since this band dropped the bombshell on us. This album is as much an album for our times as \\"Abbey Road\\" was for the last generation. Few, if any other albums released in the last 15 years have so defined an era. I'm sure there are those people out there who contest this idea, but for most Radiohead fans, and, I think, serious music listeners, this disc was a revelation.<br />By 1997 we were seeing the wane of 'grunge' and the emergence of 'nu-metal'. The deftones were all over the radio. At least in this respect, the media were promoting harsh styles of music more than ever before. Radio was becoming increasingly homogenized. (You can now go practically anywhere and find a Laser Rock station...grr.) Many music-related magazines and publications were groaning about the death of rock music. OK Computer was released into this discouraging, doubtfull marketplace. The critics raved (most of them). (Early comparisons to Pink Floyd were rampant.) This 'concept' album about the dehumanization of the world, the ascendence of technology to our detriment, becomes a sort of warning call to all of us. Slowly, interest in the band that had been percolating since their magnificent 1994 release The Bends, exploded. Radiohead became one of, if not THE, most famous band in the world. Hailed as the saviours of rock music itself. <br />This disc contains such a dark atmosphere that it is actually enjoyable and depressing at the same time. The weight of heaviness accompanying songs like \\"Exit Music: For A Film\\", \\"Climbing The Walls\\", \\"Lucky\\", and \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" is palpable. But moodiness in itself does not make a great song. Here, the moodiness serves the song and the lyrics-each feeding off the other. The overdriven bass guitar on \\"Exit Music\\" is the musical equivalent of the tense, angst-ridden lyrics. The lyrics of \\"Paranoid Android\\" are non-sensical and the music reflects thisin the way it suddenly changes and meanders-it's like three songs in one.<br />What has changed on this album is that a good deal of the rawness of the previous album has been left behind for the creepy sophistication and coldness necessitated by the lyrics. In this sense, we can easily hear the group moving towards the experimental \\"Kid A\\". Although this disc seems cold and unpassionate, these songs still breathe somehow. This is the magic of OK Computer. Radiohead have managed to tell a story of disfunctionalism, existentialism, and claustrophobia in a way that engages the listener and raises many questions. Listening to this album is also a learning experience.<br />On a final note, kudos must be given to the attention and perfection of the sound itself. Nigel Goodrich and Co. have achieved an amazing diversity of sounds and textures. The drum and bass interplay on the opening track is more than enough reason to pick this up. OK Computer really needs to be enjoyed with headphones. The sounds on the disc are so rich and deep-the sound field is wide and varied. Often Thom Yorke sounds like he is a million miles away, but in the next verse he is sitting right next to you on your couch-or whispering in your ear.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna has always been skilled at adapting her music to emerging sounds, taking them to the mainstream in a way that no one else could. On this release, she grasps onto French electro-disco and takes it for a nice ride. The production here is just as integral as the lyrics that are painted across it, the best example being the incredibly infectious &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, which has a driving beat, and such left of center lyrics as &quot;Astral bodies drip like wine&quot; and &quot;I like to singy singy singy, like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy&quot;. As silly as that does sound, it works incredibly well. The funky clash of the title track made for a perfect intro single, followed on the chart by two totally different sounds, the organic sounding dance pop &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and the gritty &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;. This album, while being heavily coated in the previously mentioned electro-disco sound, is not content to give into just one sound, as the second single and the track &quot;Gone&quot; both have a much more natural feel to them, and the track &quot;Amazing&quot; is pure pop, a sister to the smash &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;. This record manages to keep you enthralled through ten songs, not one of which could be called a dud. She still has the touch.
B00005JL3A|1.0|This movie was garbage. Pure and simple.<br />First of all, there was no plot. At all. The story is is that the Umbrella Corporation makes a virius capable of wiping out mankind. Someone steals the virius and purposely releases it into The Hive, a research complex for the virius. The Red Queen, a supercomputer or whatever, kills everyone inside except...<br />The original directer, George Romero, made a script completly identical to the game. The script was canned and replaced with this garbage. Instead of a horror movie, it was turned into an action movie, which was a bad, bad mistake.<br />We don't know Alice's name until the credits roll. What the [heck] is that? Shouldn't she get a flashback of her own NAME? Michelle Rodrigeuz was a poor actor. All she did was look constipated throughout the movie and make smart aleck remarks...<br />I really didn't like some of the other reviews. Some of them seem focused on how \\"hot\\" Milla Jovovich is. Please. Give your hormones a rest and rate the movie on its content, and not how hot the actors are. Milla isn't that good of an actor! Her acting consisted of karate moves against dogs and being half-naked at the end. Wow! Milla Jovovich half-naked at the end? It MUST be a good movie! Blech.<br />Another thing was the Red Queen. In the game, you had to run around and read stuff, and it was quite a long time before you got what was happening around the mansion. The Red Queen explains everything in five minutes. God help us.<br />There's another thing, the mansion. In the game you spend half of it in the mansion. In the movie you get a brief glimpse of it.<br />The zombies were horrible. They didn't look decomposed or dead for one thing. Another thing was when they got shot or whatever, there was almost no gore. All you saw was a bullet hole and that was it. I want to see their heads blown off and have them keep on coming. I want to see limbs missing, I want to see their heads stomped on and crushed, oozing blood and brain matter. I want holes blown into them the size of my hand. I want their see their intestines spill out of their stomachs. I want them to EAT intestines and flesh and other stuff. I am not ashamed to say this. I love gore.<br />The director said that if their was any more gore, the movie would have gotten an NC-17 rating. What? Are you kidding me? There was no gore at all!<br />Almost all of the cmmandoes get killed in a laser sequence in one of the scenes. That's just a poor excuse for them not to get killed and eaten by the zombies.<br />The game is clearly superior. The game is known for its eerie music and dark surroundings. I was gripped with fear and suspense, worrying if another zombie was around the corner, waiting to jump at me. At the movie, I was gripped with boredom.<br />Do not get this movie. Period.
B00001P4RI|4.0|If You were of the DCD fans that favored Brendan over Lisa you will enjoy this album.  If you're a bigger fan of Lisa Gerrard singing in her fantasy language, I suggest you buy one of her solo albums instead, because this may not be abstract enough for you.  Either way, this is an extremly beautiful ethereal folk album:)
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce springsteen delivers an amazing album with The Rising. Bruce is one of the few artists that can literally suck the wind out of your lungs with his lyrics. Case in point is the song Paradise, simply the most powerful song the man has ever written, and thats saying a lot. Not far behind is Your Missing and Nothing Man. To say this is a project inspired by the events of 9/11 is selling it short. It is about that and more. It's about getting on with living and not getting buried by grief. The lyrics are in turn heatbreaking and uplifting and at the same timne so is the music. The E street Band has never sounded better. They give each song just the right feel. For an artist many aside from his core audiance had given him up for missing The Rising is a welcome return to form. Many, with the exception of the faithful,had given him up for missing. The reunion tour with the E Street Band A couple of years ago brough him back into the national conscience and with the arival of The Rising, It looks like Bruce is back to stay. Welcome back Boss.
B000002UDB|5.0|If you read my review of \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" you may be familiar with the frustration I had in gaining access to my true heart's desire, \\"Abbey Road\\", which I had heard several times in the car (on cassette) on a family vacation to Maine in the summer of 1977.  Shortly thereafter, on one of me and my dad's monthly pilgrimages to the record department at the Korvettes on Staten Island I had to come to grips with the reality of the fact that they were out of \\"Abbey Road\\"...They did have plenty of copies of \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and my dad bought that for me instead...I didn't have high hopes because I was completely unfamiliar with the music, but my dad assured me that I would love the album and that it was really good.<br />Did I mention that my dad tended to understate things at times?  I immediately put the record on my turntable and my life completely changed...Prior to that moment I was just an 8 year old kid.  After that moment, I had converted to a card-carrying, confirmed Beatlemaniac.  I didn't know about any of the Beatles history, I didn't know what their discography was comprised of (the extent of my record collection at that point were a couple of Simon & Garfunkel albums, and a bunch of Sesame Street records) and did not know where \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" stood historically...All I know is that I totally loved the songs.  Like \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", this album had catchy, sometimes spooky, altogether excellent songs with great and occasionally strange instrumentation.  A perfect album to let an 8-year old's imagination run free.<br />Where to start with favorite songs?  They're all good, except perhaps George Harrison's ode to an L.A. street, \\"Blue Jay Way\\", which is one of the few Beatles songs that have never done it for me...However, the title track just rocked with a great horn section and an ending that kind of just meandered off into someone's imagination (everyone's imagination?)...\\"The Fool On The Hill\\" brought a message that was familiar to an occasionally misunderstood kid...Other favorites is the vaudeville styled \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" which may be seen as schmaltzy, in typical Paul McCartney fashion, but in my eyes is just a really pretty song.  \\"I Am The Walrus\\" is absolutely brilliant nonsense writing with instrumentation and a choral performance that, when combined with the lyrics, is completely spooky - a musical adventure all on its own.  \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is a bit of fluff, but it's pretty good fluff if you ask me.  \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" are evocative odes to Lennon & McCartney's hometown - each have great melodies, the former in a more minor key and psychedelic, the latter using a great soprano trumpeter, interesting lyrics and a major key to paint their stories...I also really love \\"All You Need Is Love\\" for its utopian message and interesting instrumentation and ending.<br />Over the years, this album never lost anything to me...If anything, the lyrics and music took on more complicated meanings...But the album never lost that sense of fun and adventure that it had for me back when I was 8.  And again, this is a strength of this album and something which really makes it special - it is accessible to a kid, but is complex enough to be enjoyed by the adult...It works on various levels...THIS IS A GREAT, GREAT ALBUM - NOT QUITE A MASTERPIECE ON A PAR WITH \\"SGT. PEPPER'S\\" BUT ESSENTIAL NONETHELESS!!!
B000069HKH|1.0|First off, the beats.  Springsteen's drummer isn't very good, and his choreography seems to be way off.  Paula Abdul is a much better choreographer than Springsteen. Second, MC Scat Kat does a great duet with Paula Abdul on her album, but his contributions seem to be buried by the bombast of the E Street Band.
B000069CWE|5.0|I got this album on the first day out, and all I can say is wow.  It is totally fresh like Hybrid theory.  The guest artists and new lyrics are really awesome!
630319656X|5.0|I was not so much exposed to this opera although I am big fan for classical music especially Mozart's.  One of my best friends was so kind to show me this video and I am greatful to that.  I totally recommend this work for all those who love art because it does not only make you comforted by the music but even the decorations of the set is lovely and shows an art masterpiece.  Own it and do not think twice.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|So, there I was, lying in bed with my Walkman circa late 1985 or so, when the clarion call of one of the best guitar openings I'd ever heard came ringing through my headphones.  You guessed it...It was the first time I'd ever heard the song \\"Money For Nothing\\" and needless to say, the song's great hooks hooked me completely.   For the next several weeks, I'd search the radio stations for this song (which wasn't hard to do because the song was absolutely played to death...).  Over the next few weeks at least one other single received regular rotation (\\"Walk of Life\\") over the airwaves...All this was enough to motivate me to buy the album.<br />Boy, was this a music purchase that was well worth the price...It is true that this album contained the great singles mentioned above, but it also contained gorgeous, atmospheric songs that actually took you on a musical journey...There are those albums where the lyrics paint the musical canvas in your head...This is one of those albums where it's the music that paints the picture with moody, meandering slower pieces such as \\"Your Latest Trick\\" and \\"Why Worry\\" and with more uptempo songs in a minor key whose titles and music evoke images (in my mind at least) of a person on an adventure such as \\"One World\\", \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" and \\"Ride Across The River\\"... But the highlight of the album, at least as far as I'm concerned is the brooding anti-war title track.  What a poignant, sad song and what beautiful guitar playing, all over the sounds of thunder in the background.  This song puts a brilliant end to an album that was already really good.<br />In sum, this album is a near masterpiece...Actually, there is not one bad song on this album - in fact, I'd say that every song is very good and some are quite excellent...The album holds together very well as a collection of songs and many of the songs (such as the singles) do very well all on their own.  I would actually rate this album 4.25 stars, and of course, round down to 4...the deduction coming from the fact that I just don't listen to it very much anymore - probably because I listened to it so much in the 1980s.  At any rate, THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM - A NEAR MASTERPIECE - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B000069CWE|5.0|Let me just say that I love Hybrid Theory.  It's probably one of my favorite CD's.  I bought this album because I liked how Linkin Park was approaching it from the standpoint of wanting to reinvent their songs that made Hybrid Theory such a hit.  And with that said, I really like this album.  I'm not much on either rap or techno, but for some reason, Linkin Park makes it work so well.  The songs I enjoyed the most were \\"P5hng Me A*wy\\", \\"Wth>You\\", \\"Rnw@y\\", \\"By_Myslf\\" and \\"1stp Klosr\\".  Reanimation is great for people that enjoyed some of the more-rap songs from Hybrid Theory.  It really is a great CD.
0071373586|4.0|I finally understand why I am such a sucker for advertising - positioning is the reason! This book uses case studies on how we have come to recognize such names as Xerox, Milk Duds, and the island of Jamaica. Very thorough and a great resource for advertising and public relations students. I liked it as much as \\"Guerrilla P.R.,\\" by Michael Levine, one of my favorites. Very useful.
B000069HKH|5.0|Get ready for a different Springsteen sound. He changed producers and has added violins to the mix of most of the songs.<br />Some people call this album a response to the events of 9/11 ...<br />For me, it's so much more. Its songs are diversified, infectious and inspiring.<br />Can't wait to hear him sing these songs live.
0380778556|5.0|While I am not typically a fan of the \\"gothic\\" novel, I have wanted to read this modern classic for years to see if it would live up to the hype. I was pleasantly surprized to find that \\"Rebecca\\" is indeed worthy of the praise it has received over the years. I won't re-hash the plot, (naive young woman marries widower, goes to live at his creepy estate where the memory of his former wife Rebecca is everywhere). Suffice to say this novel has great suspense, a superb sense of foreboding, and enough plot twists to keep you hooked. As other reviewers have stated, it was a particularly brilliant detail to keep our heroine unnamed, it allowed the lingering memory of Rebecca to pervade this novel just as she infiltrated each of it's characters. Rebecca does not disappoint, highly recommended.
B000069CWE|1.0|This CD is a big disapointment to me. This is a bunch of remixed songs from there first cd, that sound terrible! I love the songs the way they were, this makes them sound terrible! The only good song  I was waiting for &quot;My December&quot; they made sound worse than the DVD. If you are looking for new LInkin Park, this is not it!<br />I played the first one 100 times, and I will not play this one again!!<br />Do not waste your money!
0688170528|3.0|&quot;The Pact&quot; is a wonderful novel about an unusual love story between two teenagers but with a macabre twist.The story is compeling from page one, a typical Jodi Picoult book, very hard to put down, but unlike the other novels that I've read by her this one seemed to have a very contrived ending. The end reminded me of the ending for &quot;Perfect Match&quot; which was truly a remarkable novel. I felt let down by characterisation towards the end. Emily comes across as manipulative and selfish to have compelled Chris to obey her wishes, and not as sweet and loving as she has been portrayed all along. She appears as far more dominant which is out of character. Despite this it is still a great read.

B00005JA2B|5.0|Unfortunately, Kansas were not very popular at all in Australia, and as such, we have not had this album re-released on CD here as yet.<br />However, it is one of my very favourite albums of all time. As with most of the music I like a lot it has a great &quot;sound&quot;. Listening to the CD I had sent from the US I can hear the layer of sounds and instruments that are in every song. Kansas to me were the American version of Yes, and at their best encompassed what was great about prog rock. They had an excellent variety of musical styles within an album, and even within an individual song. If I had a spare twenty minutes and wanted to listen to some music, I would always put on side one of &quot;Leftoverture&quot;. <br />Every track is a winner on this album. Some may find it a little hard to get into at first, but heard on headphones and with the volume cranked up you will be rewarded with some fine listening.<br />I reckon the sound is the key to all great albums, and this one certainly has it. Well worth a try if you want to get into Kansas.
B00005J6UR|5.0|Hi, movie fans!  If you like movies, you gotta see this 1984 family classic.  It starts when an Asian man gives another man a cute little furry critter called a Gremlin named Gizmo, which he then gives to his son (Zach Galligan).  The father has been given important instructions: Don't get him wet, don't feed him after midnight, and don't expose him after midnight.  The son accidentally gets him wet, and little furballs come out of him, which become Gremlins just like Gizmo.  They are very cool just like him, but then the guy accidentally feeds all of them, but Gizmo, after midnight, because his clock says 11:30, but the cord was bitten by the Gremlins.  They then become evil and ugly, and destroy much of the town.  Galligan and his friend (Phoebe Cates, Drop Dead Fred) must stop them before it's too late.  This movie was produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Joe Dante (both of whom directed parts of \\"Twilight Zone: The Movie\\"), and in parts is violent, yet it is a GREAT family movie.  You gotta see it!  It's VERY KOOL!

Now it's passing down to my 5-month-old daughter.<br />This book teaches colors and animals.  Then at the end it reviews the entire book.  It's a wonderful learning tool for young children.

B000069CWE|5.0|I retract my earlier 3 star rating- this album completely grew on me.  It still is completely sick, dark, and brilliant...but it is also seriously infectious.  Got under my skin after one full listening session, and now I can't get enough.  Linkin Park has outdone themselves.  Buy this album!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|18 years after Born In The USA, Bruce has done it again. While I enjoy his older stuff, I really prefer these albums: Tunnel of Love, Lucky Town, Human Touch, The Ghost of Tom Joad.<br />The Rising is probably the best current rock album out there. In a world of rap, synths, and \\"Moby\\", Bruce really brought the feelings of America home. The E Street Band is unreal but it is the lyrics that make this the one Springsteen album to own.
B000069HKH|5.0|The last time I saw Bruce Springseen and The E Street Band was nearly twenty years ago, actually the summer of 1985, so to be technical it was seventeen years ago.  I remember standing for three hours in the now disappeared Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, PA with 60,000 fists raised and pumping in the air to the muscle of \\"Born In The USA\\" and \\"Glory Days\\" and watched as total strangers danced in the aisles.  Men dancing with men, women dancing with women, men dancing with women, it didn't matter.  We were with our hero and we loved him. <BR>     Years go by and we get some music by Bruce...but, there was something always missing.  It was easy to tell what it was.  The lyrics and social consciousness was still there, and it still sounded good.  The problem was (with the exception of a few songs on a greatest hits album)...for those of us from the beginning in the early 70's...there was no E Street Band.  On July 30, 2002 Bruce hands the world THE RISING. It's now July 31 and the CD has been playing non stop from my computer for over a day now.  It rates among his best work.<BR>     I must admit that I was caught off guard until about a  month ago because the news of an upcoming reunion CD escaped me somehow.  Then I find out it is supposedly going to deal with the 911 tradgedy and I'm thinking...if anybody can pull this off so soon it's Bruce, but are we ready?<BR>     It doesn't matter if we're ready, Bruce and the band deliver and the only thing to do is sit back and listen.  Despite the subject matter, once the songs get some airplay people will once again be dancing in the aisles with strangers at the upcoming shows.  The E Steet Band is that effective and necessary in making the music work.<BR>     I'm not going to list off the songs because there isn't a bad one in the bunch, but the standouts are definately \\"Nothing Man\\" which deals with what the heros who survived the ordeal might have felt, \\"Empty Sky\\" which is pretty self explanatory, and the haunting\\"You're Missing\\" that deals with the loss through the eyes of the loved ones.  Springsteen even takes a bit of a dare when he gives us his ideas of what might have been going through the mind of a suicide bomber in the song \\"Paradise.\\" As far as a full blown rocker is concerned \\"Further On (up the road)\\" fits the bill just nicely and ten years from now, fans will be clamoring to hear it in concert the way they do with any of Bruce's old classics.<BR>     The album by no means is perfect because a couple songs feel as if they might belong on another album, but after a few playbacks you'll never notice because they become one with The Rising.  Anybody who's old enough to remember what it was like to wear out an album from overplaying it...well, I don't know if it's possible to wear out a CD, but we'll all be giving it a try with The Rising.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|When I went to see this movie with my family, I was predicting that it would be another Disney fairy tale (not at all realizing that there are no pleasant monster fairy tales). Once I got out of the theater, I realized that Disney had really outdone itself.<BR>The animation (which I believe was done by Pixar) was absolutely incredible. I wish Walt Disney could see how far we've gone from drawing only four fingers because it took less time to showing each individual hair with snow on it blowing in the wind.<BR>I think the best part of the whole movie (I won't reveal everything) was the chase scene. The setting of Monsters, Inc. (the company itself) fits in perfectly for the chasing, and it was funny, too, which you never expect when you're being chased by a bad guy!<BR>So, if you haven't seen this movie, you so have to, partly because of the original idea, partly because of the incredible animation, and partly because of the chase scene, which I promise is spectacular, wait, the whole movie is spectacular!

B00005UWBP|5.0|If you haven't seen it by now, why hesitate any longer?! Get this movie on VHS or DVD and experience the original motion picture that started it all, and set the standard for all dinosaur animation to follow it. There are so many good scenes that will capture your imagination through action, suspense and awe.<BR> <BR>The film is based on the book by Michael Crichton and it follows his story-line pretty well. Using of course much less technical detail, but enough to give the viewer a bit of an understanding. Illustrating the same idea of how dangerous and drastic biotechnology can be when developed with a greedy motivation. Okay, okay I know. What happens in Jurassic Park is taking it to the extreme, but it still makes an exciting movie, nothing else is like it. Jurassic Park is just one of those memorable movies that you'll never forget.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce has written some truly amazing music in the past and this is no different.  The Rising will definitely take its place along with Bruce's 3 or 4 most moving albums.  Paradise, in particular is pure poetry.

I hit the jackpot the day I met you!!!  =)  I included Hershey's Treasures, 100 Grand candy bars, chocolate and bubble gum coins, a piggy bank, lottery tickets and this movie.  My boyfriend loved how creative I got, but best of all was snuggling together on the couch, eating chocolate, and watching this movie.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This movie should have H. G. Wells turning in his grave. I thought this would be a hi-tech remake of the original Rod Taylor flick. However the plot was thin, no character development to speak of, a vague story line and the ending was very disappointing. I will say that the special effects, visuals, sound etc. were good, however the movie falls on its face.  Unfortunately, I bought this DVD without first reading the reviews here on .... I could have saved myself [$$$]. Maybe worth the rental price, but not worth purchasing.
B00005QDW1|5.0|And I have to say that this is one of their best CDs to date.  Unlike other reviewers who have only stayed w/ No Doubt through their ultra-successful ska/punk/reggae release &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; I have been a fan since their self titled, through the &quot;Beacon Street Collection&quot; and on through &quot;Rock Steady.&quot;  Yes, this is a different musical style, but the band has evolved completley since their self titled release.  The songs on &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; are notably different from those on &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; and the reggae infused songs of &quot;Rock Steady&quot; are very different from &quot;Return of Saturn.&quot;  No Doubt retains some of their old ska/punk/reggae, but mostly they are successful in their reggae attempts.  Those expecting a replication of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; will be greatly dissappointed, but that's ok; No Doubt has never been a band to stick in only one genre!

But what was wrong with Training Day could be a list the size of my arm. <br />Denzel and Ethan was nothing more than average in their roles. <BR>The director showed very little tallent with the material. <BR>The biggest fault was the script writer (whom i cant remember his name) who comes out with the most cliched story ever. <br />So the film goes on and never gets that bit interesting and then <BR>arrives at possibly the worst film ending in history...<br />There are plenty more bad points I can say about this film, but what really annoys me is the way the British media, mainly film <BR>magazines totally overrated the film, even more so when the Academy gave Denzel THAT OSCAR..... <br />It's a prime example of manafactured hipe that a good portion <BR>of the public swallowed. <br />To end Training Day is glamourised rubbish, B-movie in a celebrity Jacket --
0767834976|1.0|I saw this film for the first time some weeks ago. I expected a hard- hitting action thriller, with reasonable acting to boot. Instead I got, what I can only describe as the worst film with Arnie (and this includes the &quot;Conan&quot; series!!, yes this film really is that bad). <BR>With a storyline more irrational than a dog on heat, Arnie leads a cast which capitulates under some truly awful script- writing. The very thought that a boy, (who also annoyed me with increasing severity as the film trudged on), could pick up a magic ticket, which transports him into different places of compromising situations, is absurd. <BR>The villains are more wooden than the &quot;Mary Rose&quot; and just when you thought the film could not get less feasible, the ending comes along, and you are left to sit on your seat, flabberghasted that you've really watched the entirity of what is a really very poor movie.<BR>Verdict: If you're a fan of nonsensical storylines and below par (more like ten below par!!), then this is the film for you. To all others who actually want to see a decent film, watch &quot;The Usulal Suspects&quot;!
B00004Z4SD|1.0|Quite simply, this was the worst movie I have ever seen. This guy decides to ride his lawnmower half way across the country to see his long lost brother. Good for him. I wouldn't do it, and did not appreciate being along for the ride in this awful movie.<br />For some background info, I am not a David Lynch fan. I enjoyed Blue Velvet, but have pretty much hated everything else by him. But this is the worst.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I went into watching &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; with low expectations.  I get tired of movies portraying rich valley girl bimbos that have good luck in life because of their looks.  Well, now there is sweet revenge because this girl's got a brain!<BR>Reese Witherspoon is funny, charming, bright, etc. as Elle Woods, the fashion-design major who sets out to become an attorney to keep her snobby boyfriend Warner.  She meets adversity because of her Barbie doll looks and wealthy lifestyle, but she actually sets out to prove that she can work just as hard as everyone else and earn respect and success.  How very noble of her. <BR>And the character is worthy of respect.  The audience will undoubtedly root for her as she makes her way from being late to class to assisting in a sensational trial.  The rest of the cast is great as well, but Witherspoon just can't help but outshine them.  One exception might be Selma Blair who gave an excellent performance as the icy classmate who has stolen Warner's affection.  <BR>There are plenty of funny, even some ridiculous moments in this movie, most of them involving Elle trying confidently to fit in in Harvard's schoolbook-serious environment.  But there is also some drama to keep things interesting.  And it's not just a chick flick.  It's the kind of movie that both men and women can find humorous.  Overall, a nice, lighthearted, enjoyable movie.
B00003CX9W|4.0|\\"Fantasia\\" is a Disney movie for the older crowd.  I don't think small children can truly appreciate the blend of animation and classical music in this one.  My mother says I watched it when I was little and fell asleep.  Must have been the calming sounds of violins and flutes.  :)<BR>But she brought it back to my attention when I was twelve.  I was delighted to see sequences like the beautiful fairy and flower dances to \\"The Nutcracker,\\" the parade of centaurs and cupids set to Beethoven, and Mickey Mouse stirring up trouble in \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice.\\"  <BR>Some people balk at the restoration quality of the original film.  All I can say is this:  I remember seeing \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" sequence on the Disney Channel when I was a kid.  It was grainy, muddy and dull.  When I saw the first attempt at restoration on VHS in the early 90s, it was a HUGE improvement.  Sixty years can take its toll on film strip.  We cannot possibly expect perfection.<BR>You may ask, why did you only give it four stars?  I will tell you why, and I will tell you that I will feel this way until the day that I die.  I absolutely despise the \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" sequence.  I thought it was too scary, too evil to be part of a collection of much lighter cartoons.  I have only watched that sequence all the way through ONCE and that was enough.  It gave me nightmares for days (and now that I'm thinking about it...oh, not again).  I'm not overly religious or anything, I am just not a fan of cartoon demons.  Even at 22, they still scare me.  <BR>Even though the \\"devil\\" cartoon haunts me, I do enjoy the rest of the film.  Each animated clip is perfectly suited to the musical piece, creating a synchronicity between art and music.  It paved the way for the more technologically-advanced \\"Fantasia 2000,\\" another great film that unfortunately lacks the hand-drawn authenticity of the original.  \\"Fantasia\\" was one of many of Disney's revolutionary cinematic statements.
B000069HKH|5.0|15 outstanding songs, clocking in at 73 minutes. Mostly recorded in Atlanta, Georgia, this latest release by Bruce Springsteen proves again what a wonderful combination The Boss and the E Street Band make - and never mind the occasional synth drum loop.<br />At 52 years of age Bruce Springsteen returns with another classic album, a brilliant mix of sombre anthems and harmonious rockers. \\"The Rising\\" is a fantastic CD that should please both die-hard Springsteen fans and occasional listeners as well.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I first watched &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in college in a class called history of journalism.  We were drawing parallels between fictional newspaper giant Charles Foster Kane and real-life media mogul William Randolph Hearst.  There are so many coincidences that it's no wonder this film was almost halted before it hit theatres.<BR>But it's still fantastic and especially revolutionary for 1941.  Multi-hyphenate Orson Welles and cinematographer Gregg Tollan employed innovative filmmaking tricks that had never been thought of before.  And Welles delivers a stirring performance as sometimes carefree, sometimes brutal, but always wealthy Kane.  It's an engrossing and interesting story filled with success, heartache, and scandal.  <BR>In order to appreciate the caliber of this movie, you must understand film history and how advanced this movie was compared with other films made around the same time.  You must also have some knowledge of Hearst's life so you can appreciate some of the humor and satire.  Otherwise, you will find it boring and certainly won't understand why the AFI called it the greatest movie ever.<BR>Do I think it's the greatest movie ever made?  No.  What is the point in calling a movie the greatest ever made when movies are still being produced today?  Who's to say that a movie won't come along in the future that leaves &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in the dust?  It hasn't happened yet, but it could.  Either way, this film will still have a prominent place in cinema history that will never be taken away from it.
B00004YKUX|4.0|There's age in this great voice and some of these songs emphasize the age.  But the essence is still here, loud and clear.  <br />His opening cut, &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot;, is the immortal Johnny C., making a powerful statement, followed with another powerful statement, Neil Diamond's &quot;Solitary Man&quot;.  The emotion really gets to one in his rendition of Frankie Laine's &quot;Lucky Old Sun.&quot;  <br />&quot;I See A Darkness&quot; and &quot;Mercy Seat&quot; do rather send chills, and one wonders it these two are not reflections of Cash as an older man.  But there's sure some brightness with Johnny &amp; Merle together on &quot;I'm Leaving Now&quot;.<br />&quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot; is a somber windup to this album, but as a whole, this belongs right with his older recordings.
6305077630|5.0|Could anyone really create a girl on their computer in 1985?  Probably not, but that doesn't stop Gary (brat packer Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell Smith) from giving it a shot.  Mystical forces soon take over and the two high school losers are left with a beautiful bombshell who is willing to fulfill their every desire.  Every boy's dream, right?<BR>Well, not exactly.  They are so inexperienced and scared that they don't know what to do with the wild party girl.  The movie walks us through their journey from quirky geeks to studs when they finally stand up for themselves.  <BR>The two guys have great comic chemistry with Kelly LeBrock, computer babe Lisa and create many laughable encounters with each other and other characters.  Bill Paxton, a more serious actor today, is convincing as the rotten Chet.  This is the role I will always remember him for, no matter what other movies he goes off to make about ghosts or twisters.  <BR>Director/writer John Hughes delivers another timeless gem about teenagers, continuing with the traditions of \\"The Breakfast Club\\" and \\"Sixteen Candles.\\"  Here he gets a little sillier, but still remains clever and true-to-life.<BR>DO watch this movie uncut on VHS or DVD if you really want to enjoy it.  Cable TV does it absolutely no justice.
B00005JKL8|2.0|Who decided that Owen Wilson could be an action star?  He doesn't work as one.  He should stick to comedy and helping Wes Anderson create genius movies.  This movie is ridiculous and predictable and I really never felt myself pulling for Wilsons character.  Actually I found myself saying &quot;it would be cool if he died right here.&quot;  But like I said, it's predictable so that never happened.  Not the worst movie, but not that great of one either.
B00000IJPU|3.0|All in all I think this is a decently OK greatest hists collection. It does contain some of their best songs ever such as \\"The Number Of The Beast\\", \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", \\"The Trooper\\", \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\", and \\"Aces High\\". But before I get too far on the subject of how good it is lets skip the trash, and get down to the point. I think this is a terrible album. It focuses way too much on their latter yet not so good albums. Some of these are \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\", \\"Fear Of The Dark\\", \\"Somewhere In Time\\", and \\"The X-Factor\\" or something like that which dosen't even have Bruce Dickerson in it. NO! Instead it has someone by the name of Blaze Bayley who can't even sing. I would also like to point out the fact that there is not one song on here that features the singing of origional vocalist Paul Diano. He was only on 2 of their albums but those 2 were 2 of their best ones(\\"Iron Maiden\\", and \\"Killers\\"). There is however \\"Running Free\\" on here but it is a latter live version which is not nearly as good as the origional. <BR>On this album there is no \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\", \\"Sanctuary\\", <BR>\\"Wrathchild\\", \\"Flight Of Icarus\\", \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\", \\"Die With Your Boots On\\", \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" or \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\". There is a double album out which is better, because it adds in more of the early classics and only adds in a few of the latter songs. But either way \\"Flight Of Icarus\\" is still missing. <BR>So my main complaint is that some of the early \\"good\\" songs are missing because they are overshadowed by some of the latter \\"not so good\\" songs like \\"Bring Your Daughter...\\", \\"Can I Play With Madness\\", \\"Virus\\", \\"Fear Of The Dark\\" ect. So if you are a new Iron Maiden fan, don't buy this. Buy the double album because you will be exposed to a lot more good music.
B000069CWE|5.0|this cd has the phatest beats, the remises are relly great,thi is a must have cd in your collection. The artist that thy have rap in there songs make it sond really good, buy this cd you will love it!!!!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|The first thing striking in the new producer. It's like U2 meets John Mellencamp. I have to include Mellencamp because the drums have that same cracking sound like Scarecrow. The lyrics are stark and the vocals brooding on some tracks. However, there is a song here called Mary's Place that is like Rosalita revisited. He has that young Bruce voice that has me wondering where it's been for the past 20 years. <BR>There is an unmistakable rebirth of faith. While he doesn't draw on actual scripture like Dylan on Blood On the Tracks, he does use Biblical imagery. It's classic Bruce because there is the optimism found in the despair. I think it will translate well on stage with a healthy dose of the lesser know tracks from the River like The Price You Pay and Jackson Cage.<BR>Overall it's an exceptional piece that will probably stand up against his finest work. I'll say this, it's not going to be easily accessible (Like Born In the USA) because it is a difficult subject and the words are hauntingly vivid. There's a song called You're Missing that could really set you back emotionally. On the other hand, a song called Waiting On A Sunny Day is a feel good song that provides an easy listen. I would highly recommend it.
B000001F84|5.0|rush;s classic 1976 album 2112 is averry incredible well made album.first you got the 20 minute 7 part7 titlted epic that will blow youaway witch takes up the first halfof the album then you got 5 more great songs such as a passage to bankok and something for nothing.i got this on compact disc andit sounds great great job by geddylee.alex liefson and neail peart.any of you rush fans that  dont have this one ya gotta go out andget it.
B000002I6T|5.0|This is a fine solo effort by Mr. Crosby. Every song is good. The music is beautiful. Adjust your mood, put on the headphones, kick back, close your eyes and let the music take you away.
B000063K2W|5.0|I absoulutely adore this movie. It is a great chick flick. There are some very funny parts in it. The clothes are just to die for and the fashion show is fabulous. I love the ending it is absoulutely hysterical... \\"There is a name for you ladies, but it is not used in high society out of a kennel.\\" LOVE IT!
B00005JKNC|1.0|Well.  It's not often that a movie manages to bore me, offend me and make me groan, all at the same time.  First, yes, the mood is intended to be Capra-esque, although the plot is largely lifted from the much more acerbic Preston Sturges (&quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot;).  If you happened to like this movie, see if you can find the Sturges film.  And by the way, even Capra at his most sentimental is much tougher than this gooey flick.<br />It's painfuly slow and boring.  Endless (although it appears it's going to end several times).  <br />Setting aside the unlikely possibility that a whole town would indulge in a collective delusion without more questioning, the gosh-darn credulous sweetness of just about everybody in the town mirrors a nauseating nostalgia that has nothing to do with any real-life people ever.  Even Capra admitted this -- just consider the balancing view of Pottersville in &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot;<br />The worst part of the movie is when Carrey is able to overcome the dreaded red-baiters of HUAC by simply reading from the First Amendment.  This is such an insult to all the good people whose lives were ruined by the witch hunt that I was finally roused from my boredom to get angry.  And then to place the cherry on top, apparently the whole small town is filled with extremely enlightened liberals who consider him a hero for standing up to the committee.  If this unlikely event happened at the time, I suspect that McCarthy, Cohn, and Hoover would have put the whole town under surveillance.<br />Carrey is acceptable in the film, but the director and writer have drowned him in dreck.
0525946284|4.0|I... I think it's important to note that yes, at times the book is a little bit corney,but it has it's place, and even though it seems that they are some unlikely heroines, most of them die.Anyway I thought it was an awsome book.
B000001EL7|4.0|By the time I originally got this on cassette, several things had happened.  One, I had gotten so much KISS, I was getting burned out on them.  Two, the studio versions of \\"Christine Sixteen\\" and \\"Tomorrow And Tonight\\" were nothing compared to the barn-burning live versions on Alive II, which I heard first.<br />So, now that I've finally gotten it on CD, what do I think of Love Gun today?  Well, it's improved after my initial assessment.  However, I still maintain the piano intro on \\"Christine Sixteen\\" should've been junked for Ace's guitar to maintain a consistent rocking sound.  Note: for those wondering where Tone-Loc got the sample for \\"Funky Cold Medina,\\" \\"Christine Sixteen\\" is the source.<br />The swift and rollicking \\"I Stole Your Love\\" is one of the best openings KISS has during their early makeup albums.  \\"Got Love For Sale\\" is definitely a tighter number compared to anything done on Rock And Roll Over.  \\"Shock Me\\" is Ace's solo singing debut and one of the high spots on the album.  This really gives Ace to showcase his virtuoso guitar work.  Now why couldn't the crunchy rock guitar like that have opened \\"Christine...\\" oh, I already complained about that.  Skip it.<br />The title track is another KISS classic with its quickly hammered out chords.  This is a perfect example of the KISS synergy together--Paul's vital vocals, Gene's thumping bass, Peter's thunder god drumming, and Ace's soaring and snarling guitars.<br />Peter's \\"Hooligan\\" is good, but he's had better songs on the other albums.  \\"I'm a hooligan/won't go to school again.\\"  Hooligan, school again... nice!  And to show how much of a hooligan, \\"I've got a 35 chevy on a 55 frame.  Can't even spell my name.  Dropped out of school when I was 22.\\"<br />\\"Almost Human\\" has a close rhythm to \\"God Of Thunder\\" in parts, except that's it more refined and better.  And Gene sings this as well.  \\"Plaster Caster\\" has an opening guitar reminiscent of \\"Love'em And Leave'em\\" and a sound like \\"Ladies Room.\\"  Much of the comparison to the Rock And Roll Over songs is due to the fact the Eddie Kramer stamp here--yes, he produced both albums.<br />And finally, the first song KISS covered, the Crystals' \\"Then He Kissed Me,\\" regendered as \\"Then She Kissed Me.\\"  Solid and a worthy cover version.<br />This is a very strong album, in terms of the production and the teamwork of the quartet, continuing the heights they reached in their self-titled album and Rock And Roll Over, my two favorite makeup studio albums.  So a word of advice.  Get Love Gun, THEN Alive II in order to get the full effect of the album.f the comparison to the Rock And Roll Over songs is due to the fact the Eddie Kramer stamp here--yes, he produced both albums.<br />And finally, the first song KISS covered, the Crystals' \\"Then He Kissed Me,\\" regendered as \\"Then She Kissed Me.\\"  Solid and a worthy cover version.<br />This is a very strong album, in terms of the production and the teamwork of the quartet, continuing the heights they reached in their self-titled album and Rock And Roll Over, my two favorite makeup studio albums.

B000002HMH|5.0|Load is probably my favorite Metallica album.  The songs are so different from each other, you would think 14 different bands wrote the songs.  The best way to appreciate this album is to put it on the stereo while you're doing something (reading, eating, etc.), and let it play in the background as the soundtrack to your life.  You will be rocked.  Even &quot;casual&quot; Metallica fans can appreciate such knock-outs as &quot;King Nothing&quot;, &quot;Bleeding Me&quot;, &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;, and &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;.  Buy it for &quot;Outlaw&quot;, it is worth it!
0893860220|5.0|I read it the first time in June of 2002. It quite simply is one of the best books on the Absolute (non-dual). In a very direct, no-nonsense style, Nisargadatta spells it out. The book is full of deep metaphors pointing us beyond the mind such as:  &#34;The personal needs a base, a body to identify oneself with, just as a colour needs a surface to appear on.&#34;  &#34;The mind exists in two states: as water and as honey. The water vibrates at the least disturbance, while the honey, however disturbed, returns quickly to immobility.&#34;  What is not poetically stated as such is given very directly:  &#34;To know that you are neither the body nor mind, watch yourself steadily and live unaffected by your body and mind, completely aloof, as if you were dead. It means you have no vested interests, either in the body or in the mind.&#34;  &#34;Self-remembrance, awareness of 'I am' ripens him powerfully and speedily. Give up all ideas about yourself and simply be.&#34;  The value of this book cannot be overstated I hold my copy very close and dear. From the perspective of sheer knowledge this book wastes no paper. The non-dual doesn't waste your time.  I've noticed in that the same depth of wisdom is given by a few others such as: Jean Klein, Ramana Maharshi and Paul Brunton. All are authorities on the non-dual. The reason for the similarities is that essentially the books are written by the same author, The Absolute, filtered through the personality/ego of the body delivering the material.  Note: Not everyone is ready for this book (i.e.the few 1 star reviews). I wouldn't have been had I purchased this earlier than I did. The longer I have it the more it reveals. I would almost swear it's changing with me.
B00002MZ4W|3.0|I don't think that Fiona Apple's sophmore release is bad, I just think that it pales in comparison to Tidal. And while this is less than extradinary, it is, however, much better than some other similar disappiontments in recent years, such as Strange Little Girls by Tori Amos and Exciter by Depeche Mode. The lyrics (though not as good as Tidal's) are as witty as ever, but while the dark sarcasm is still evident it's not as forward as on Tidal. I also find the songs to have weaker melody lines that are thin on hooking the listener. The piano parts are also less beautiful here with more chaotic chords that seem to go nowhere. The only songs that really strike me as being good are &quot;The Way Things Are&quot; and her first single, &quot;Fast As You Can&quot;. I just love how she sings really quick on the verses and then slows things down on the soothing bridge release only to pick things up again in a feverish tornado. I even tried singing it once but found myself laughing too much because I didn't know the words very well... (LOL!). I just hope that when and if she does bring another album out that it will be better than this less than stellar follow-up to a grammy-worthy debut.<br />P.S. - If you understand what the title means in full than please oblige me by letting me know!
B000069CWE|5.0|In the year 2000, a new band came out of the horizon to fuse rock and rap together (which wasn't exactly a new thing)... but were different than Limp Bizkit or Korn or any other rap-metal or nu-metal group. Their name was Linkin Park. By now everyone knows who they are and probably has their &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; record, but I joined the revolution a lot sooner. Before &quot;In The End&quot; or 8 times platinum. Back when I had to convince people to at least try Linkin Park. Reanimation puts me back in that state of mind. They completely changed, &quot;reanimated&quot; every single song that Linkin Park ever did (well...except one or two off the Hybrid Theory EP). By now... I couldn't stand &quot;In The End&quot; and &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; barely gave me the thrill I got in Christmas of 2000. But today, I felt that Linkin Park redeemed themselves and gave me back the thrill I got when I first heard &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. To put it shortly...if you liked &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; you may not like this...but that's the entire reason why it's so groundbreaking. Sure, &quot;Reanimation&quot; may not sell 8 million copies, but it will make a lot of LP Underground members (like myself...come to Cleveland LP!!)and true LP fans very happy.
B000069CWE|5.0|Hybrid Theory was, in the opinion of most, an excellent album, and was certainly a financially successful one, especially considering it was the first serious recording venture made by the California band. The songs were usually bitter, often sorrowful, but seldom really angry in the dark, Nine Inch Nails sense of the word. NIN and bands like it have demonstrated that you don't have to be loud to be bitter and brooding, and Linkin Park has embraced this theory in Reanimation. By and large, the tracks on Reanimation are much quieter than their Hybrid Theory counterparts, but they are much darker. The effect complements the original album very well. The remixes themselves are very masterfully done, most notably 'Enth E End' (the almost jazzy new piano sample will catch your attention right away) and 'Krwlng' (Staind's Aaron Lewis lends himself very well to the song). The remixes of 'Place For My Head' and 'Pushing Me Away'--to which Korn's Jon Davis lends his considerable talents--and the previously unreleased track 'My December' are also well done. However, if you didn't care for Hybrid Theory, don't expect to enjoy Reanimation. Listening to the CD, I found myself preferring and disliking the same songs that I had when I got Hybrid Theory. Overall, though, it's certainly worth your money and an excellent CD to have, especially if it's to complement Hybrid Theory. Just as a brief aside, if nothing else go to a store and look at the back of the CD. You can have a little fun trying to decipher the twisted takes on the names of the original songs. 'Frg/10' gave me fits until I figured it out.
B00005KHJV|5.0|Nine years after the cancellation of his favourite TV show, a berserk Star Trek fan dons a Captain Kirk mask and returns home to exact his revenge on the ambivalent viewing public he holds responsible for its demise.  Perennial horror favourite launched the career of Jamie Lee Curtis and confirmed Charles Cyphers as a bonafide box-office superstar.
B000069CWE|4.0|The new CD by Linkin Park, Reanimation is very good but it's nothing new. They remixed alot of there old songs and threw in a couple of new ones as well. All they really did was transform there old songs from rock to dance/techno in a sense, which I admit is done really well, and theres really nothing to improve on what they did. But one thing is lost, in Hybrid Theory it had tons of raw energy that clearly ran through the entire disc and in Reanimation it was gone. Bottom Line: Linkin Park was the #1 selling album in 2001, and for them there is no where but down. But they did a really good job on Reanimation, and only took a small step down. If you like Linkin Park, or even tapped your foot to it before you owe it to your self to buy it.
B000069HKH|5.0|This album floored me -- I didn't think Bruce and the E's had it in them anymore -- hell, I didn't think rock and roll had it in her anymore.  This is classic Bruce and IMHO right up there with his best (BTR, DOTEOT, The River).  <br />Poignant . . . hopeful . . . beautiful . . . even fun.  (This stuff should be AWESOME live.)  &quot;Empty Sky&quot; resonates with me the most right now, and I think it will be playing in the back of my head every time I look at our skyline (&quot;I woke up this morning to an empty sky.&quot;)<br />I've got to give this album some time to sink in -- and I have a strong feeling it will only get better with time.  If you like Bruce, get this ASAP.
B000069HKH|5.0|The popular music scene has not been much to write home about lately.  There have been a few brief flashes of genius, usually from a previous generation's artist, but that is the extent of music's greatness in this age of mediocrity where every rap and R&amp;B song sounds alike and Limp Bizkit (emphasis on the limp part) rules rock.  Seems that most rock bands have forgotten how to roll anymore.  Re-enter Bruce Springsteen, possibly the greatest American artist of the rock'n'roll era (yes, greater even than Dylan, who I'm a big fan of, but who can't put much emotion into his music).  The Rising is, frankly, the greatest album yet released in this new millenium.  Heck, it's the greatest album released since U2's Achtung Baby back in late 1991.  It's tender, it's sad, AND it rocks AND ROLLS.  Springsteen brings humanity back into music, a device that is absent in the musical meat market of &quot;baby I need you&quot; or &quot;let's bump and grind baby.&quot;  In The Rising, Springsteen fuses loss with hope and humanity with spirituality.  Funny that these items have been gone so long that the ideas sound very original.  Some of these tracks are memorials (Into the Fire, Empty Sky, You're Missing, The Rising, and a few others) but the memorials are not downtrodden eulogies - they bustle with the excitement and heroism of the lives they celebrate and they make the men and women who have given their lives, in Sept. 11 and other events, very real.  Probably the greatest cut on this record is the title track, one of the best songs released in the last decade.  Every song here deserves special consideration.  Mary's Place is a rouser that is akin to Springsteen before Born to Run.  Paradise is a look into a suicide bombers head (empathy is one thing that no artist can handle like the Boss) and a very sad song as well when things do not turn out as promised.  Nothing Man is the story of a survivor of a tragedy - a tragedy that everyone else can get over, but he can't.  Eachsong is infused with energy.  Many of the songs are experimental (well, they're experimental in the sense that Springsteen has never done many of these things before).  Some songs seem fun on the surface, but may have more urgency to them.  Let's Be Friends is an example of this, a hidden desperation that is also found in Dancing in the Dark off of Born in the USA.  All in all, this is a great record and highly recommended.  It's easy to tap your foot to it, but I recommend reading the lyrics along with the lyrics a few times - you'll be glad you did.  73 minutes rarely ever passes by as quickly as when listening to The Rising.  I'm not gonna call it the Boss's best album ever, but I don't really think you can compare his records.  Each of them has a certain sound and spirit that makes them unique and great (except for Human Touch, not a bad record by any means, but not great).  This one is different just like any Boss album - and that's a good thing.  The Rising isn't a Born to Run or Born in the USA redux, it stands on its own.  Thank you Mr. Springsteen for bringing rock'n'roll back!
B00000ILDF|3.0|This third installment in the popular Alien series gets close to greatness but doesnt quite make it.  Alien 3 brings back the horror element of the series that was lacking a bit in Aliens, but in doing so we loose character development and a stable, tight, plot.  The begining and ending of the film are brilliant and riviting, yet in the middle we have a seemingly endless blur of unknown people being conveniently wasted, to the point where it takes away the horrific edge.  While a few moments of brilliance shine through (namely, Charles Dance's performance), its not till the very end that the plot kicks into high gear.  And even then we are treated to one last barrage of bald unknowns being torn to pieces; (I dont see how it would have hurt the film to let a few more guys live).  It is also most regrettable that the few characters that do become likable are killed off.  The movie leaves me pondering how great it could have been, if only more time had been put into the writing.
B00005JL3A|4.0|It's so refreshing to see a horror movie that actually takes itself seriously. I'm old enough to remember when scary movies actually believed they could frighten you and not show their insecurities through self-parody. The closest movie I can remember to this one is Aliens by James Cameron, in which the action takes turns with fear. <br />Of course, this movie is based on the video-game series which I know only by reputation. Probably one of the reasons behind the movie is a marketing one, which works, because now I want to play the game.<br />In the world of Resident Evil, the world's largest corporation is secretly conducting genetic experiments and developing biological weapons. A problem develops when one of these biological weapons, called the T-virus, is released in one of the company's underground labs. The lab, called The Hive, is controlled by a super computer called The Red Queen. She kills all the employees in one manner or another in order to contain the virus. A team of paramilitary soldiers is sent in to shut her down, not knowing that they will release zombies who have a taste for living flesh. Milla Javovich plays a soldier who guards the entrance to The Hive, and due to her proximity to the lab, was knocked out by nerve gas, and has lost her memory. <br />I really liked this movie. It reminds me very much of the George Romero movies, but with more style and more of a budget. There are a lot of frightening moments. You don't ever get a tongue-in-cheek comment or a moment of goofiness that you see in Wes Craven movies. In fact, what horror director can you name these days besides him? It's pretty sad about the poor lack of quality AND quantity in horror. Witness the idiocy of the new Halloween movie, or Jason X. They would make Ed Wood roll in his grave. Resident Evil is grim, gruesome, bloody, apocalyptic, sad, brutal, entertaining, and invigorating. The look of it is  beautiful, lots of greys, blacks, and whites, with Milla's red dress of blood flashing through it all. <br />The director, Paul W.S. Anderson, has really outdone himself with this film. It moves and pulses and oozes, and creeps around you. This is greatly helped by the soundtrack recorded by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. I really liked the Alice in Wonderland references. That's how you feel, as though you're in the land of the videogame, where only it has any reality. Anderson shows us what John Carpenter or George Romero could have become instead of sinking into obscurity and B-movies.<br />Now, for the DVD quality. The picture is beautiful and the menacing ambience of keyboards and guitar is really good. It features 5 short featurettes: \\"The Making of Resident Evil\\", \\"Scoring\\", \\"Costumes\\", \\"set Design\\", and \\"Zombie Make-up Tests\\". The making of the score is interesting because we find out that Marilyn Manson is actually a pretty intelligent guy.....uh, girl.....uh whatever. It also includes a video from the Black Sabbath/Texas Chainsaw Massacre band Slipknot, if that means anything to you.<br />Something pretty disappointing about the DVD is the movie commentary. It features Milla Javovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Producer Jeremy Bolt, and Paul Anderson. It's disappointing because everytime the two filmmakers start to discuss something interesting in the movie, Milla comes in and interjects \\"nobody cares about that\\" or \\"that's not very interesting\\" and goes into some rambling that has nothing to do with the film. In fact, at the beginning, it seems as if Milla doesn't even know what a commentary is: \\"you mean we're going to comment on the whole movie?\\" She comes across as an immature valley girl. You can always just never listen to it. <br />If you long for the days of a real horror movie, check this dvd out.
B000066NW0|3.0|first of all if you call avril lavigne punk then you donno how to define punk. this album and her is nowhere near punk more like pop. its very commercial and even tho skater boy may be one of the harder songs , it just does not compare. at all. Avril can also not compare to Alanis, her lyrics are so much more deep and thought-provoking and really gets you from the gut. I'm not saying Avril Lavigne is another bad poser for teenagers of this century, in fact her songs are quite good (although i dont like pop that much. Anything but Ordinary is my favourite song on the album.
B00005OAIE|1.0|This guy stinks....<BR>He is very boring and lacks enthusiasm and excitement. I didn't like him from the start and I still don't. He is a bad songwriter<BR>but an allright guitar player. I am a big Dave Matthews fan but I WILL DEFEND Mayer here... Where the devil does he draw similarities to Dave? He sounds nothing like him. Now I will suggest you try out Jack Johnson who is a new artist like Mayer...But Jack Johnson is actually pretty good.
B000069HKH|5.0|Excellent songs and excellent lyrics- a combo so rare today.  Bruce and gang do it again, and produce another fantastic album!
B00003CXI1|5.0|The movie edition of this wonderful first installment in the Harry Potter series finally brings the imagined word pictures to life. Wonderfully directed, artistically put together, this great movie is good for everyone. One suggestion- always read the book before you watch any movie. Reading is knowledge.
B000069HKH|5.0|Great songs, great lyrics- a combo that is so rare today.  Bruce does it again, and produces a fantastic album.  Highly recommended!
B00000HYXB|5.0|Blind Guardian is, in my humble opinion, the greatest band ever, and this is the essence of all that makes them great.  \\"Nightfall in Middle Earth\\" is the best album on the face of the planet.  It's perfection cannot be expressed in words, but I'll try.  <br />Blind Guardian have always made incredible albums, but they went far above and beyond anything they had previously done when they made this.  It's just unbelievable.  The texture, the layers, it's amazing.  Marcus and Andre may technically not be the best guitarists in the world (but they could surely play the fingers off anyone on the radio), but their ear for music is astounding.  Here, they ease up on the hyper shred solos, and make them more creative and melodic.  This album has the best solos around, hands down.  Not the hardest to play, but definitely the coolest.  Sometimes they sound like flutes or something.  Thomas Stauch is one of the best drummers ever, and this is some of his best work.  and Hansi Kursch..wow.  This guy has an amazing voice.  Is that really the voice he was born with?  Is it really the way he naturally sings?  One of the best, most unique voices ever.<br />The story is based on Tolkien's \\"The Silmarillion\\", and it's done perfectly.  Puts the book to shame.  Sometimes it's emotional, sometimes it's more upbeat and fun, but always highly enjoyable.  \\"Nightfall\\" is my favorite song of all time.  Don't bother to look for a catchier chorus, you won't find one.  \\"Noldor\\" is a close second.  It's more sad and mournful, and very emotional.  Hansi's vocals are downright bone-chilling on this one.  But how can I pick a favorite song?  This album is perfect in ways I still can't believe.  There is no album this good, it is just the greatest thing ever.  Even Dream Theater's \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" can't touch it (sorry, Wickerman).  If you love great music, you owe it to yourself to buy this.  It will change your life, hopefully for the better.<br />PS:  I still can't figure out the intro to\\"Blood Tears\\".  Very weird stuff!
0790734060|2.0|I think we live in an age where truth doesn't matter.  The film 'Amadeaus' is a prime example of how a completely fabricated story can pass off as something genuine.  The film has created a bogus story for the sake of drama and sensationalism.  It makes Mozart look like some God who had everything easy and then goes on to say his father's death had something to do with his death.  Hollywood will anyting to create mystery out of nothing.  Most embarassing of all, Mozart's wife calls him \\"Wolfy\\".  Boy, I'm sure people in the 1700's talked like that!!
6300214354|5.0|Forget \\"Airplane\\", forget \\"Naked Gun\\", and definitely forget \\"Hot Shots\\".  You want something funny?  This is one of the funniest, most underrated movies I've ever seen.  I never really thought of Val Kilmer as a funny guy.  At least, not until I saw this.  The story doesn't really make a lot of sense, but it's basically about a rock star who gets caught up in some kind of international conspiracy, and craziness ensues.  The story's not that important, it's the goofy little left-wing gags that will win you over.  Soldiers play tic tac toe with by shooting out window panes, the general's rundown of the plan of action in which a perfect scale model just happens to be nearby, and everytime Kilmer gets intimate with his lady friend, a fireplace suddenly appears out of nowhere, even in mid-air as they jump from an airplane.  If any of that made you smile rather than roll your eyes, you need to rent this.  Recommended highly to fans of \\"Airplane\\" and \\"Naked Gun\\".  It's pretty stupid, but in a good way.
B00003CXI1|1.0|I saw this movie thinking it was going to be the biggest thing since Star Wars, and can't believe the HYPE from such a Lousy Movie!! To think people actually said \\"Lord of the Rings was competition for THIS!! A Movie actually needs to be \\"GOOD\\" to have Competition. The only movie that compares to the entertainment and enjoyment of Harry Potter is \\"Ishtar\\". Brutal!
B00005ATQ9|1.0|This movie looks beautiful.  The costumes are impeccable, indeed downright gorgeous.  The details regarding furniture, horse furniture, glassware, uniforms, even playing cards is astounding.  The indoor scenes are shot by candlelight to give the proper feel.<br />This movie sounds beautiful.  Music by classical composers of the highest calibre and incidental traditional music by The Chieftans is staggering.  There is never the jarring feel of non-period music or sounds, no cars, no synthesizers.<br />This movie is boring.  Ryan O'Neal looks as if he is made out of a very fine quality of wax -- he never emotes, never even appears to stir.  Nothing touches him physically or emotionally.  The plot is dull, the acting duller.  There is no point in the movie where I give a damn about any of the characters, least of all our titular hero.  No passion, no interest, no involvement; everything is poor affectation, as if the tale is taking place at two or three removes from the characters supposedly involved.<br />I love this movie on DVD.  Now I can rent it, scene-select the truly fine sequences (the battle scenes, the card game) and not have to sit through the rest of the excruiatingly dull compost heap that is the rest of the film.
B00005MCX0|5.0|I was probably in 3rd or 4th grade when I first discovered Hawkwind.  A friend suggested I read Micheal Moorcock's Elric saga.  After completeing the series, the violent visions in my pre-teen head thirsted for more.  At my elementary school library I found that Moorcock was cross-referenced to a picture book about rock bands of the seventies.  I learned from the book that he played with a band called &quot;Hawkwind.&quot;  At the time I listened to alot of Twisted Sister and Billy Idol and I wasn't about to spend my allowance on something as bizarre as what I saw in that book.<br />As I grew older (and my tastes matured?), I would see Hawkwind albums in the used bin at the local record store but, at that time, they seemed either too &quot;cheesy&quot; (a word we used alot back then) or too metal for me to take a chance on.  Later, I became familiar with Motorhead and I had a renewed interest in science-fiction which lead me, after almost 20 years, back to Hawkwind.<br />What's the point?  Well, the point is that people who really love music find deep personal and emotional connections to their favorite bands and albums.  The fabric from which our tastes evolve is woven with memories of our pasts.  That might be why when I first heard In Search of Space, everything about the album made sense to me.  The smooth sonic segues between songs, the battling oscillators, the thudding bass and expressive drumming; faraway vocals and riffing guitars suggesting more than merely martian alienation.<br />This digitally remastered release of Hawkwind's In Search of Space album makes a perfect launching pad from which to explore other of the band's releases.  Hawkwind  completely come together conceptually and sonically on this album.  I have been searching for a band that does a better job of what these guys do and I have yet to find them.  (My buddy asked me recently why I buy so many albums; I told him it's because I've been looking for a band as good as Hawkwind).  They find the perfect balance between two styles: more prog than most rock and more rock than most prog (particularly on Master of the Universe and Silver Machine).  <br />I hope that you too will give them a chance and be rewarded as well as I was...
0151008116|5.0|This quite possibly the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  Without giving anything away, the story has so much heart, so much soul, and is so rich in detail that it is easy to immerse yourself and empathize with Pi's plight.<br />It is an amazing story laced with mythical and fablelike qualities that one read may not do it justice.  I especially enjoyed the section in which Pi makes a &quot;botanical discovery.&quot;  This particular portion is written so descriptively you feel as though you are sitting with Pi in his lush surroundings.<br />This book stays with you.  I finished reading it in May.  Now it is August and I am still thinking about it writing a review.  As soon as I am finished with my current book, I am going to reread it.<br />Enjoy it, pass it on, and share the experience
B000069CWE|5.0|I have not listened to this cd yet. But from i can tell this cd rocks. If you liked Hybrid Theory like i did. You will thourly enjoy this cd. Peace out.
B0000640SA|5.0|This movie is a testament to Christopher Nolan's artistic ability to direct a well crafted thriller and still tell a tragic story about loss, love, justice, and manipulation. The loss of love, memory, have happened to Leneord (Guy Pearce)who is seeking revenge for the murder and rape of his wife. He lossed his short term memory during the incident. The movie works in reverse, so the thriller is even more compelling.<br />He is further burdened by two others in his \\"short-term\\" memory life: Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and (Natalie) Carrie-Anne Moss. Both persons are manipulating Lenoard and as the story progresses, one feels sorry for are tragic hero, because no matter how hard he tries and every system he employs to remember events, he is surronded by people who have other agendas for him.
0316666343|5.0|I recently read this book.  I enjoyed it thoroughly!  I had a hard time putting it down, yet didn't want the story to end when I was down to the last chapters.  Sebold's visions of heaven and getting to know each character was a thrill.  For an easy and entertaining read, I highly recommend this book.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Well, if there is anything negative I have to say about \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" movie trilogy, it is that it almost feels like a pity we have to wait for almost an entire year to see the next movie (and the GOOD DVD!!!).<BR>Well, having now seen the first movie, read all three books,and seen the teaser trailer for this movie, I`m pretty sure Jackson & Co will do everything well with the second installment of the saga, too. <BR>Jackson said in an interview that the famous (for the fans of the books)Battle of Helm`s Deep is going to be a 45-minute action sequence, with no interrupts!<BR>I promise you all, this ain`t going to be like anything we`ve ever seen on the big screen before. <BR>In short : Peter Jackson is the king of Hollywood and         LORD OF THE RINGS ROCKS!!!!!
B00000IPAX|5.0|OKAY  SO  BLINK  MADE  A  BIG  CHANGE,  FROM 1992-1998   THEY WERE   LIKE   A  DIFFERENT   BAD.   BUT   NOT   TO  ME, EVERYTHING   NEEDS   A   CHANGE.   DURING   THE   &quot;DUDE RANCH&quot; ALBUM        (1997)    THEY HAD THE TO HITS     &quot;JOSIE&quot; AND &quot;DAMMIT&quot;.  FROM 1-10 AND 10 BEING AS BIG AS EVER THEY WERE LIKE A FIVE.     GETTING A LITTLE OUT OF THE UNDERGROUND.   <BR>       AFTER  THE UNKNOWN &quot;CHESHIRE CAT&quot; ALBUM. THEY   ASKED   FOR   HELP   FROM   THEIR   GOOD   FRIEND   AND THERE   PRODUCER. ON   THAT   ALBUM  &quot;DUDE RANCH&quot;   THEY  SINGED  FOR MCA   RECORDS.  THEN   2   YEARS  LATER  THEY  PUT  TOGETHER A HELL OF AN ALBUM    &quot;ENEMA OF THE STATE&quot;    WICH IS REALLY DIFFERENT   FROM THE OLD BLINK.   THEY NEEDED A CHANGE, AND CHANGE   IS GOOD,    DON'T CALL   THEM &quot;SELL-OUT&quot;    AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.   IF THEIR &quot;SELL-OUTS&quot;         WICH THEY'RE NOT,      THEN JUST DON'T LIKE THEM ANYMORE IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL.        AND YES WE ALL KNOW THAT SCOTT LEFT.<BR>IT   WAS   LIKE THE  BEST  RESON   TO  LEAVE THE BAND,          TO FINISH COLLEGE,  AND BLINK DID HAVE A SONG ON THE ALBUM             &quot;GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE&quot;,   BUT IT REALLY HAD NOTHING TO  WITH SCOTT.   ANYWAY   MARK   AND   TOM FOUND   TRAVIS (WICH COME ON, HE'S REALLY COOL) WICH   THAT   FORMED  THE   DUSTED OFF   NEW   AND   IMPROVED BLINK-182. AND &quot;ENEMA OF THE STATE&quot; PROVES   THAT   THEY ARE  BETTER  THEN EVER.  MY FAVORITE  TRACKS SUCH   AS &quot;ADAM'S SONG&quot;, &quot;ANTHEM&quot;   WILL LEAVE YOU   BREATH    LESS   AND    LEAVE   YOU    CRYING   BECAUSE IT'S   GONNA   BE   THE   BEST   THING   YOU'LL   EVER   HEAR. THIS   HAS  TO  BE  THERE   BEST   CD,   COME  ON   THE   TWO BIGGEST   BLINK   HITS  EVER   &quot;WHAT'S MY AGE AGAIN?&quot; AND    &quot;ALL THE SMALL THINGS.&quot;         THEY COULDN'T STAY THE SAME   BAND   BEING   UNKNOWN FORVER,   WITH NOT ENOGH MONEY AS THEY WANT IN THEIR POCKETS. THEY WENT ONTRL, YES TRL, WICH IS NOT  BEING  A  SELL  BECAUSE  IN  THERE   1997 AND 1995  ALBUM THERE  WAS  NO  TRL BACK  THEN,  SO  THEY  COULDN'T  BE  ON TRL COULD THEY.     AND 1999 THERE WAS A TRL,                        AND  THIS ALBUM WAS OUT TOO  SO WATCH  OUT  TRL, HERE  COMES BLINK. I   WISH   I SAW   WHEN   THEY   PERMIERED &quot;WHAT'S MY AGE AGAIN&quot; HISTORY IN   THE   MAKING   DEFFENITLY.  AND  THEY  ARE THE  BEST  OUT  THERE,  AND  THEY  WENT  FROM  AN  UNKNOWN ZERO AAAALL THE WAY TO A TEN and yeah the capital letters do hurt your eyes, sorry .- MICHAEL ZARATE
B000005IRG|5.0|Gushing reviews can be horrible, but this album deserves it.  Though it's only an opinion, I'd state that this could possibly be a perfect collection of music.  The four musicians play together well and are easily seperated, but couldn't be eliminated.  They play their instruments... they're talented.  The lyrics are thoughtful and interesting.  The music itself is visionary, if nothing else, but that's enough.  I've only had the album for two days, and I can't stop listening to it.  &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; and &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;...  It reminds me a lot of the Velvet Underground's &quot;Loaded&quot; album, though it's up to you to decide on that album.  It just has that same feel to it.  However, I think the musicians in Television were more talented than those in VU.  Yeah, so get this album if you like other music from this scene: Talking Heads, Patti Smith, etc.  I'd have given it 6 stars, if I could have.
B000002LMK|5.0|Wanna see a bunch of 70's folkies run? Just put on Ragged Glory and crank it up. This definitely isn't the Neil Young that I suffered through highschool with in the early 70's. It's not that he didn't write great songs. It's not that he couldn't sing. It's not that I was listening to too much Jeff Beck and Ten Years After at the time. I'ts just that I had too bad memories of those Neil Young folkie wannabees who liked to bring their acoustic guitars to school and give their own lame (and flat) renditions of \\"Heart Of Gold\\" or \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\". Ugh. So, I never was a big fan. But then Neil Young met this little garage band called Crazy Horse, and everything was good again. Which brings us to this Raggedly Glorious album. What a way to wring out the New Wavish 80's and bring in the Grungy 90's. Yes this is sloppy. And yeah, it's noisy. But it's also melodic. And it's also some of THE best Neil Young songwriting since those early 70's days. It's a very unique album that's mixes stretched out notes of distortion ( a great Crazy Horse trademark) and extended guitar solos that, as the old 70's phrase goes, \\"I can really get into man\\".  Songs like the great 7 minute opener \\"Country Home\\", which is actually one of Young's leftover songs from the 70's with Crazy Horse that he had never recorded before. And \\"Mansion On The Hill\\" feature some of Young's best songwriting of his career. They also can play some flat out mean grungy Seattle type rock with the excellent 60's garage classic \\"Farmer John\\" and \\"Love To Burn\\". I love the way they end this too, with a kind of acapella version of Mother Earth done live with just a hint of a quietly distorted guitar playing in the background. Young  doesn't sound half bad when he's singing a chorus with someone else. Especially on a song this catchy. This is great stuff. One of the best rock albums of the 90's. Even though I'm much more of a folk fan now than I was way back when, if I had to choose between the Gold Rushes,the Harvest's, and this Ragged little album, well let's just say I'll take the Crunch. Highly recommended listening!
B000001FOL|5.0|That's what I feel about Nico.  I think anyone could like her, if they gave her a chance.  Her very deep, German-accented voice can be hard to listen to.  I liked what I heard on &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot; immediately.  The only thing I'd criticize about this album is that she didn't have much to do with writing the songs.  Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Jackson Browne and John Cale wrote most of them for her, or gave them to her... It's a beautiful album.
B0000640VN|5.0|This movie is the cutest! Meg Ryan is supurb in her role. I recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This movie is scary every once in a while. But it's not a waste of time. You will love this movie when you see it. It's worth lots of watches. So if your home or at boring old work and your reading my review, then get up and go rent this movie. Your missing out on one of the best movies in the world.<br />Running Time: 122 Minutes<br />Rating: PG for Mild Language and Some Scary Moments
0786867973|5.0|The author's show, \\"Nigella Bites\\", always makes me think of the hamburger commercial that shows several young men betting on whether the beautiful young woman eating a hamburger will drop catsup on her shirt.  Nigella licks her fingers, brushes her hair off her face, dribbles food on her chin, and flirts with the camera.  Her show seems to be aimed at the same market as the hamburger commercial - randy young men.  However, the title of this book is intriguing and I ordered it.  I wasn't disappointed - Lovely recipes, very enjoyable to read.  Beautiful photographs, altogether an enjoyable cook book although I don't know if I'll actually bake any of these cakes; they all seem to contain a cup of butter and 8 ounces of almond paste.
B000069CWE|5.0|We finally have the first good remix. You don't have to hit the skip button any when listening to this, every song is good. Linkin Park is here to stay. Can't wait for the next album. Get this CD now!
0553210246|5.0|The Mayor of Casterbridge is undoubtedly one of the finest novels of the Victorian Era - quite a tribute given that the period produced a countless number of classics. The conflict between Michael Henchard and Donald Farfrae reflects a clash between tradition and modernity. This dichotomy is perhaps best encapsulated in their contrasting styles of record keeping; Henchard relies entirely on intuition and memory while Farfrae maintains extraordinarily meticulous accounts of all his transactions. Furthermore the struggle between Farfrae and Henchard reflects a conflict of vastly different temperaments. Henchard proves to be of a passionate temperament while Farfrae is rational and levelheaded. For instance, despite his modest means and limited experience, Farfrae boldly ventures into agricultural trading and through a series of shrewd bets manages to unseat Henchard as Casterbridge's preeminent merchant. In order to regain his erstwhile position, Henchard engages in rash and seemingly desperate speculation - in contrast to the prudent risk taking of Farfrae - that ultimately culminates in his ruin.<br />While some AP students have chastised Henchard for his inability to overcome his animalistic nature, the more astute reader realizes that his inveterate character serves to illustrate a basic theme of most Hardy novels - the philosophy of determinism. The rise and fall of Henchard illustrates the unpleasant reality that one's life is subject to forces beyond one's control - in Henchard's case a deeply flawed character - and these forces often overwhelm the power of one's determination and ambition. This doctrine is certainly anathema to 21st century Americans who firmly believe in the concept of free will and a future holding great promise. While constantly lamenting one's ill fate is self-defeating, it would be naive to entirely disregard the power of destiny to shape one's life for worse as powerfully shown in the tragic tale of the Mayor of Casterbridge.
B00005NW02|4.0|Most of the latest heavy-metal bands on the radio leave me unimpressed, with their similar names, similar sounds, and one-hit wonder songs.  System of a Down, on the other hand, stands out with their lyrics - instead of generic depressed lyrics, they're standing up for something.  The music is tight and real heavy.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons - the lyrics tend to repeat a lot in most of the songs, and the heavy guitar parts are either single-chord rhythmic patterns or 3- or 4-note riffs repeated in a single measure.  A little more riffage a la Clutch or Corrosion of Conformity would get a fifth star from me.
B00005MAM2|5.0|At first when I saw this movie, I wasn't a huge Anime fan. I saw the old version with the old voices before it was digitally remastered. I was blown away!!! The movie was just awesome. The voice overs were perfectly  matched to the adjacent character, everything was just perfect in the movie. It took me about 2 to 3 times watching it to totally get full grasp of the plot line, but when I did, I was blown away yet again.<br />It came out on DVD and I was so happy that it was digitaized and the visuals got even better. The voices were a little different but still excellent. I watch the DVD of Akira all the time and it one of my favorie movie's over all time. Definately in my top 3. So to anyone who thinks this movie sucks, give it another try because I have seen Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D, and Ghost in the Shell and only one of them have even come close to Akira, and that is Ghost in the Shell, but, since I am not writiing a review on that movie, let me just say once again, Akira is the King of all Anime movies, and this may be a pipe dream, but maybe a sequel just as good will come out soon.
B000069HKH|1.0|Bought it.. Heard it... Chucked it...<br />Why do people have to be so damn political.  Healing? Give me a priest, not some guy that sounds constapated.  <br />This album is all hype and no pay out, and you all just got suckered.
B000069HKH|5.0|I am yet to get the CD but I have had the chance to record the concert on NBC's Today show yesterday (hey, I leave for work by the time the show begins), saw Bruce on Brian Williams (MSNBC), and ABC Nightline last night.  So I have listened to at least 5 songs.   What a comeback!  USA reborn!  This album could indeed make Americans feel proud to have such character.  To have such deep sense of empathy and express what we all felt on or after Sep 11th through popular music is an art that only Bruce can showcase.<br />I have always loved his deeper writings and this one is the best.  It makes you feel that emotion all over again but in a way that you can move on with life and not be paralyzed.  In a way your kids can listen to 25 years from now and still feel the same emotion.  A masterpiece.  A classic. It will be listened to for many many decades.   Thanks Bruce.   You are the Boss!<br />Buy the CD.   Mine is coming.
B00003CXI0|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie.Especally when They are with Hagrid and he always says i shouldnt of told you that.Even though i knew that they had to cut some parts out they could have cut different parts out and showed more lessons!My favorite part in the book iswhen fred and george are talking before they get on the train.They didnt even put that part in it and it was the funniest part of the whole book.The movie could have been 10-15 minuts longer and they could of added those parts.And when they open the nimbus 2000 at the table wasnt it suupposed to be opened at the commom room in the boys dormitory?They also changed that when they meet fluffy its because of the midnight duel and nevil is there.They also didnt go on a changing starcase and what happened to the sinking step.Over all i think that the movie could have been much better i was so excited that there was a movie but when i saw a lot of parts were missing i was very dissapointed.
0767805712|4.0|Anyone who has studied genetics knows that this is not sci-fi, at least not for long. The day will come, barring some dramatic catastrophe that destroys human civilization, when we will deliberately alter the human genome to suit or wants, and (we will presume) our needs. It will all start out rather innocently; say pre-birth immunity to certain diseases like Malaria, Alzheimer's, or certain cancers. But eventually designer children will come, and when they do, natural selection will be determined by your birth therapist. This movie is very clever in how it deals with the social aspects of this possible (and perhaps unavoidable) future. As they say in the movie, ` we now have discrimination down to a science'. You can't help but feel for the main character Vincent, who is a `faith birth', because all of us (except perhaps Al Gore) were born naturally, without gene therapy. So we would all face discrimination, which is another interesting point the movie hints at. Who cares about the color of your skin anymore, we're more interested in what your genome looks like. <br />       This kind of sci-fi is based in science too, not in explosions, space car chases, or gritty unshaven (and possibly inebriated) main characters that make wise cracks every 30 seconds. There aren't many technologies in this movie that aren't possible right now either, giving it its not-too-distant future feel. Another aspect I liked was the costume design, and architecture incorporated in this film, which all come from various parts of LA, and Orange County. They gave a very minimalist feel to the movie, which is apparently one of the best and easiest ways to convey a futuristic setting. It's never too much to presume that 40's fashion and art deco might not come back into style either. If the 70's can be considered cool again, I guess anything is possible...    <br />      I was deeply impressed with this movie when I saw it in the theatre. I was living in L.A. at the time, so maybe that's why it was actually IN theatres. Genetics has been an interest of mine (probably ever since I was a kid watching GI Joe, and Cobra genetically engineered Serpentor), and so when I saw the adverts for this movie I knew I wanted to see it. This was the movie that changed my opinion about Ethan Hawke, who I couldn't stand after seeing that piece of [junk], Reality Bites. He actually convinced me that he was Vincent (and then Jerome). I wouldn't suggest this movie to just anyone however. Here's a litmus test (and if you don't know what that is then you've already failed): If you thought the movie Armageddon was good sci-fi, or for that matter even watchable, it's probably best to stay away from this movie. It's probably way beyond your ability to grasp, what with its subtleties, social commentary, and lack of stunt work, or professional wrestler cameo's. To everyone else with an I.Q. over 100 this movie may appeal to you, and therefore I recommend it.
B00006674X|5.0|Many people rate this movie based on how it stacks up to other Elvis movies.  Well this is not an Elvis movie.  This is a really well written, well acted movie which happens to have Elvis in it.  I think this movie shows that Elvis could act, but let's not forget that other people were in this movie as well.  I find Mary Tyler Moore a perfect match for the role of the love interest/nun in this movie.  Even she herself has said that she didn't think she was right for the part, but I disagree.<br />This comedy/drama has all the right substance for a GOOD movie and if you don't get what the movie is about, that just too bad!
0783225903|5.0|You're not smarter than everyone else for liking, or like me-loving, this movie. I admit that no one I have lent my copy to has yet liked this movie, and that's too bad (but thay are no less intelligent because of it). Years and years ago when I worked at one of those BIG video stores (which I will not name here), I used to try to talk people into taking back the movie they had selected in favor of Brazil. If they seemed reluctant then I would simply ruin the ending of the movie in their hand, and then assure them I was saving them time and money. The job was really boring, so I had to keep myself entertained. No one ever complained though...     That aside, the movie is really stunning. It's the theatrical equivalent of a Dali painting, at least in theme. Terry Gilliam has done some impressive things in film, but this movie, at least to me-and some others- is a masterpiece. With out a doubt it is bizarre, and the fantasy world of Sam Lowry is only slightly less bizarre than the reality this movie asserts. Its first rate satire, as only the British can supply it(yes I know Terry is from the states, but he's pretty much an honorary brit), with a love story that doesn't need to be believable for this movie to work. There's so much social commentary, that for it's time was ahead of it's time: a child asking Santa for a credit card for Christmas, Sam's mother and mothers friend trying to one-up each other in plastic surgery. Outrageous. Why can't Hollywood make movies like this? Fight Club was a good effort, but it tried too hard to be cool, and somehow tainted the over all quality of that film (which is not the point here). The Robert DeNiro cameo was so unexpected that it felt like a cavalry charge, and it worked so well because that's what his character represented.      The movie meanders on from one daydream to another, one bit of faux-reality to another, until it becomes difficult to tell one from the other. Its bleak landscapes are quite intentional, and serve well to crush the viewer with the monstrosity of modern living. Quality of life becomes a real question as the movie takes you through its paces, and caters to ones deepest anxieties about life in the near-future. But to say this movie is depressing does it little justice. At times it can be uplifting. It's just not Hollywood fluff spoon fed to you, which is ironic being that the consumer is the hand that feeds them. A mutually parasitic relationship perhaps? Who can say...     I could still watch this movie many times over, and really regret not to have been able to see it in the theatre, where movies get their best treatment anyways. Still I try to get others to enjoy this movie as much as I do, but it seems destined to be a cult classic, which to me has so many negative connotations. So buyer/renter beware. But I really don't think this movie should be a source of elitism, which also has its own negative connotations. I myself am an idiot, and still I love this flick, so maybe there is hope for the world yet!
B000066NW0|5.0|For anyone who has ever heard one of Avril's songs, you will understand when I say that her music is the best thing I've ever heard!  I seriously suggest listening to this.  Then again, I'm 13 so you may not take me seriously.  However, disregard the previous information and listen to this!  It rocks! (Especially Sk8er Boi!!!!)
B000069CWE|5.0|Guess whos back... i'll give you a hint, THE BEST BAND EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Yeah you read correctly Linkin Park is back with their album reanimation.  this is probably one of their best albums and it will forever stay in the minds of all linkin parks hardcore fans.  if you bought hybrid theory and you liked it then u will love Reanimation.  i definatly reccommend it to anyone who knows and likes linkin park and even to people who heard some of their song and enjoyed it.
B000002LOM|4.0|Do not allow some other reviews fool you.  There is a certain degree of consistency here such that you get an album feel.  Indeed, I've come to expect certain songs to follow each other.  Also, lets not forget that without this album, Morrissey would not have created Arsenal or Vauxhall.  This album truly captures a period when Morrissey was in the process of reinventing himself, a time when he was arguably at the top of the music world.<BR>I would like to note that music aficionados are going to love &quot;Mute Witness&quot; and &quot;Found Found Found.&quot;  The CD also ends with &quot;Tony the Pony,&quot; a song not originially on the album.  Goodbye.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I avoided this at all costs at first, thinking that it would be horrible beyond belief.  I began to become intrigued when I learned Paul Anderson made it, because of the fun unpredictability and B movie charm of Event Horizon.  I enjoyed this one more.<BR>As pure enjoyable trash, this movie is to savored over many times.  While I cringe at buying from Sony (because a Superbit DVD will likely follow), I was pleased with the picture and sound.  I hoped that there was an uncut version out there (it SHOULD have a rated X for violence version), but no deleated scenes were included, so I am unsure.<BR>With fewer horror filming coming out, I am looking forward to Resident Evil 2 next fourth of July.
B000002UAX|5.0|Some people may disagree with me, but I feel that this is their best work.  This has got literally something for everyone.  Whether you're into hard rock, country, pop, ska, etc you'll find a song to fit your tastes.  I prefer the first disc, with songs like 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' (My favorite Beatles song), 'Ob La Di Ob La Da', 'The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill', 'I Will', and 'Blackbird' to name a few.  But the second disc also contains such gems as 'Revolution 1' (Way better than the other version), 'Helter Skelter, 'Good Night', 'Everybody's Got Something to Hide, Except for Me and My Monkey', and 'Savoy Truffle'.  In short, buy this album it's really good!
B00005JKBC|4.0|Nathan Muir (Robert Redford), a CIA operative, is going to work for the last time before retirement when he finds out that his previous student, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), has been caught.  His last day at work ends up being much more exciting than anticipated, since Bishop only has 24 hours left to live.  Meanwhile, there is an investigation regarding Bishop and his capture by the Chinese government.  The investigators ask strange and unusual questions and are unwilling to share the purpose of these questions.  As a result, Spy Game offers a thrilling and touching cinematic experience.
B00004VXF2|5.0|It's one thing to hate this cd. Fine. I believe more than half of the favourable reviews explicitly say it's not for everyone.. But to  say these people who enjoy the cd are nuts is just absurd. This album has always polarised listeners just because of how bizarre it is, but it shouldn't induce name calling.
B000002U8G|3.0|For all the questionable praise \\"Meddle\\" received when it was released, it would still be a couple of years before Pink Floyd became phenomenons--this album was NOT their first set to crack the US Top 50, as inaccuracies might lead one to believe (that title went to their 1972 soundtrack album \\"Obscured By Clouds\\", which hit #46). One of their most highly praised pre-\\"Dark Side\\" releases, Pink Floyd's 1971 album \\"Meddle\\" is somehow simple in the winding journey of music it yields, yet at the same time very puzzling in its arrangements and overall production; the band itself produced the record, making the generally poor production all the more baffling. The first two tracks, the album's classic highlight 'One of These Days' and the lullabye 'A Pillow of Winds' are deliciously contradictory--the former is deep and exhiliratingly ferocious, while the latter is a soft guitar and vocal composition. The arrangements of these songs are just about the only things which give the production side of \\"Meddle\\" a leg to stand on. 'Fearless' is poorly recorded and written almost as badly, while 'San Tropez,' a cheezy little ditty is fun to relax to, but holds no place with the rest of the album, sounding more like one of Pink Floyd's earlier singles than a sign of maturity and progression. 'Seamus' was meant to be a musical 'joke' by the band, with a country theme and howling dog in the background, but its purpose on the album is puzzling. And finally, the epic twenty-minute plus 'Echoes.' One of the favorite Pink Floyd tunes of about ninety percent of the fans, its arrangement is disappointing and staggering to follow the disjointed waves of sound and variations it offers, though there are many places in the song which are promising. Overall, the production of \\"Meddle\\" is poor, leaving a lot of promising themes and ideas in the cold, yet the high points of the album are truly wonderful, just as the low points are truly disappointing.
B000069CWE|5.0|This cd is awesome! I got it in the mail today and it was definitely. It isn't just a bunch of remixes. It's a bunch of VERY VERY good remixes! The cd looks nice and the display cover and all look great. <br />The songs are all awesome and have their own uniqueness about them. The special guests are amazing and it's great how they put the cd together. I highly recommend it for any Linkin Park fan.
B000066NW0|5.0|I can't stand Britney, Christina, Jessica, and the rest of the teen-princess crew that's out there right now.  Being that Avril's nearly 1/2 my age I was a little concerned about buying &quot;Let Go&quot;.  I finally caved in and bought it because &quot;Complicated&quot; kept bouncing around in my head and I thought once I owned the thing, the song would go away.  It did...only to be replaced by 6 other songs off this album.<br />From this old Betty's perspective, the lyrics are fun and catchy.  I can also see how my 15 year old niece thinks the same lyrics &quot;speak her life.&quot;  Ah...to be young again.<br />Musically, Avril is just absolutely gifted.  Her voice is pure and powerful.  The tunes are melodic with a kick.  And more than one will bounce around endlessly in your head...trust me.
B000056H24|5.0|This new DVD is beautiful. It is actually a few minutes longer than the Roadshow Cinerama engagement back in 1965.  The 5.1 sound on a THX system is chilling. The music score itself brings tears to your eyes. As for the story of Christ i believe this is the best you will ever see. The all star cast plus the excellent work of Max Von Sydow as Christ is the most believable you will ever see. I feel very humble when i watch this movie and my faith excells more and more with each showing and i learn more an more also.Do youself a favor, forget all those other films especially the so-called epics of the life of Jesus and get this one. It is beautifully made and has an incredible music score to back up each powerful scene.  You will be blown away with emotion.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Blade was even stronger and faster and tougher to beat then the first one.When he fights vampires it's like he plays around with them it's so easy,but then he met the reapors which caused a bit of a problem for him but he got through it.I can't wait for the 3rd one of the blade series its gonna be even better i hope anyway,i think they should bring back decon frost(stephon dorff)because he is the blood god and the blood god came back once why can't he come back again.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Actually, all hail to the entire album, because everything about it is awesome.  I love Jack Black, so of course I was going to get it.  I'm glad I did.  These guys are hillarious, as well as also being very musically talented.<br />Tenacious D combines humor with music.  There are great songs along with some of the funniest skits you will ever hear on an album.  These guys aren't very heavy.  The songs are subtle, but brilliant none the less.  You will crack up in laughter and be in awe at the same time.  They are great singers and great guitar players.  Jack Black really does have a great singing voice.<br />Favorite songs: tribute, wonderboy, city hall, lee, friendship, karate, kyle quit the band.<br />Favorite skits: one note song, hard ****ing, inward singing, **** pushups, drive-thru.<br />A very awesome album, it is.  Don't let the humor fool you, these guys are very talented, and should come out with more great songs in the future.  Tenacious D truly rock.<br />Now, stop reading this review and go get the CD!!  What are you waiting for??  It's calling your name.  (Well, it's not.  But get it anyway!)<br />P.S.  Jack Black ripped me off.  I came up with the \\"one note song\\" years ago.  Well....actually I didn't.  Um.....Shut up!  Leave me alone!

B00005R87Q|4.0|The point of this movie wasn't the acting, or the plot. To say an action movie about street racing has poor acting is redundant. Obviously you sacrifice acting to make the cars the main character, and the cars ARE the main character. And they do not dissapoint, as long as you know that you're seeing street racing. Not F1, not Nascar, not unrealistic $300k machines racing somewhere, but street racing. Normal people putting in real work into cheap cars to push them to the edge.<br />I've also read too many ppl who are dissapointed with the cars, but the problem is that these ppl are simply clueless. The cars in this move are the epitome of street racing. No one races porsches and ferraris in street racing. Its all about the cheaper, souped up imports. Imprezas, Eclipses, Supras, Civics, Integras, RX-7s, etc. Maybe you'll see an American muscle car now and then, but not too often. They've gotten too expensive. Even more expensive but still retailed sports cars (i.e.- NSX, Viper) are too expensive for street racing.<br />Don't rent/buy this movie if you're expecting to see $200k stock sports cars. THe stock price of these cars don't exceed $25k. I've also read a remark that the directors made up a chemical name to give an extra \\"ooomph\\", so to speak. To the contrary, nitrous-oxide, or \\"nox\\" as it is referred to, is a REAL program, used in conjunction with the cars computer to alter factory settings in order to squeeze out extra performance. (Granted, the \\"turbo boost\\" that you automatically get from pushing a \\"nox\\" button may be a little unrealistic). It is quite illegal but it IS used on sports cars in street racing. If you love cars, like I do (All cars minds you, not just high priced lookers), then you will like this movie.<br />P.S.- After rewatching the movie, the acting nor the plot is terrible for an action movie. Vin Diesel does a decent job, as does Jordana Brewster. Michelle Rodriguez was quite disspointing though, I'm still waiting for her to play a non tough-girl role.
B00003CXI1|1.0|If your kids are Harry Potter fans, they will like this or any other movie about Harry Potter.<br />For any other person who wishes to see a quality movie and not a character legend, this is a bad, boring, absurd and a waste of time.
0060273224|5.0|Now, I first read this book when I was 12 or 13... Maybe.  Perhaps before.  Anyway, now I'm nineteen and still love this book.  Why, it's right behind me right now so I can read it in a lull.  It is wonderful and I would recomend it to anyone who loves fantasy.
0553260111|1.0|So *this* is the best-of-genre, best-of-author novel, correct?<br />I'm not impressed.  I'm disappointed, actually, and so thoroughly frustrated by two rampant flaws in Ludlum's work that I found it hard to finish the book.<br />One, Ludlum has constructed a plot with so many poor and impossible devices that I now see why the genre had acquired a bad name.  *This* novel may be the progenitor of all bad cliches for spy thrillers; if not, it certainly represents the pinnacle of achievement.  Example: the protagonist's companion has an omniscient ability to root out the intent of the US government; more likely, Ludlum found no way to tie in his loose threads other than to make her a forensic genius.  Or: the convenience of all encounters working to our protagonist's advantage.  The general who sees something trustworthy in his face, the woman who sees something courageous in his actions, neither holding any grudges or connecting past behaviour to the present.  Can you say &quot;inconsistent&quot;?<br />The characters are unbelievable.  It's as if I'm reading a parody, but since it's played straight, it's even worse.  For Ludlum to play off these ridiculous characterizations, his tongue would have to be *through* his cheek and not in it.<br />Two, and this is by far the most egregious, is that this novel was far, far longer than it needed to be.  The pacing is uneven; the beginning was hyper and subsequently, all chapters seem subdued in comparison.  However, the necessary buildup for the next part of the roller coaster is wholly inadequate.  And the complexity of the plot is unbelievable, both in scope and execution.  There's a secret government agency, but it's imbued with good people; there's a secret assassination cartel, but it has admirable ethics; the protagonist just happens to hook up with a beautiful woman who falls in love with him - loves him! - in a matter of a few weeks; the protagonist consistently outwits a professional killer, apparently just by going to school for it.<br />Oh, would that I could get back the time spent in reading this thing.  The reviews for this book serve as poor indicators of what's to be found; let this sacrificial review be a warning to readers of Andrew Vachss, Stephen Hunter, even Tom Clancy.  You'll find no consistency or solid writing here.  Don't pay to read this book.o school for it.<br />Oh, would that I could get back the time spent in reading this thing.

B00000DI2T|2.0|Ten years ago, I would not have evaluated this set in the same way. At that time, I thought Bernstein's Mahler and Mahler's Mahler were one and the same. Now my perception is that while Lenny did Mahler a great service in the '60s with his pioneering complete set on CBS (now Sony), in the '80s Bernstein smothered the music with his own apparent agenda. Put another way: If Bernstein in the '60s was \\"selling\\" Mahler to a skeptical audience, in the '80s he seemed to be selling his own interpretive stamp as the ONLY way to play this composer's music, overshadowing the less interventionist viewpoints of any rival conductors. It takes an outsized musical personality to eradicate most of what is recognizably Mahlerian in these scores and turn the composer into a hybrid--Mahlerbernstein or even Bernsteinmahler--but Bernstein was just the man for the job.<br />Compared to the more consistent (if in some ways outmoded) CBS series, the DG cycle is uneven in its successes, if quite uniform in its overall approach (less nervous energy, more world-weariness--even in the \\"young man's music\\" that is Mahler's First Symphony--and more spotlighting and underlining of details). The Sixth and (especially) Seventh Symphonies as presented here are among the most convincing available, while the First and Third Symphonies are also recommendable, even if both are marred by tempo and phrasing exaggerations and inflated sonorities. (The finale of the Third may be the slowest on disc, running for 28 minutes--not 25:01 as indicated on the original CD release and accepted without question by critics ever since.) As for the remainder, it's a very mixed bag, despite the (very high) level of commitment Bernstein gets from his orchestras. This performance of the \\"Resurrection\\" Symphony reminds me of William Shatner doing one of his indescribable spoken-word records, while the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies take an enervated, depressed, mannered view of these scores, forgetting all about such niceties asmomentum. Yes, there is \\"intensity\\" here, but it's forced. Tempi, dynamics, expressive markings are either exaggerated and distorted, or else Bernstein blots them out and substitutes his own. The Fourth Symphony here never quite comes together as Bernstein's underrated 1960 version did, and it's worth noting that the Eighth (a 1975 concert from the archives that was pressed into service when Bernstein's death in 1990 prevented DG from completing the series with a newly-minted Eighth) sounds more tired as it goes, and from the outset there are patches where everybody goes off-key.<br />The song cycles are also uneven. Thomas Hampson's contributions are fine, but the overblown set of \\"Wunderhorn\\" songs completely misses the rusticity and innocence inherent in even the most sardonic songs. (Soloists Andreas Schmidt and the late Lucia Popp have much better work in Mahler than this to their credit.) For \\"Das Lied von der Erde,\\" DG borrows the 1966 Decca recording (also issued separately on that label) in which Bernstein took the less-common option of two male voices. Unfortunately, one of those voices is Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau at his most histrionic (although his murmurs of \\"ewig\\" in the closing bars of \\"Der Abschied\\" are as spellbinding as the deathly hush Bernstein casts over the orchestra). However, the overall \\"sound-world\\" of this \\"Das Lied\\" is closer to Bernstein's CBS set, and unintentionally makes much of the latter-day cycle sound bloated by comparison.<br />In and of themselves, these recordings are distinguished, and never, ever dull. Even at their most wrong-headed they make an undeniable impression that you're in the presence of a high-powered musical entity. But what is on display here is rarely the music of Mahler as he composed it.
B000069HKH|4.0|This is the first Springsteen album I've bought since \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" and I must say that my first impressions of it are very good. Lyrically, it's obvious that the events of 9/11 had a profound effect on Bruce, and he expresses feelings that I'm sure many of us have felt or experienced in the months since the tragedy. That's always been one of Springsteen's great gifts--the ability to express the hopes and fears of regular people. Musically, the E Street Band is outstanding, and the album blends the traditional \\"Bruce\\" sound (in particular, the tune \\"Mary's Place\\" which could have easily fit on \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"The River\\") with more experimental sounds. It's great to hear Bruce and the band stretch out a bit (without trying to sound trendy). I think long-time Springsteen fans will be happy with the results.
B000069CWE|3.0|Reanimation does not even come close to Hybrid Theory, the best album in the world. Most of the songs take about 2 minutes before the music actully plays, and even worse, most of the songs are HIP HOP. This CD dosen't really stand out, and could've been a lot better. Oh, well, Linkin Park is still my favorite bands. And the best song is #19, 1Stp Clsr.
B00006690H|5.0|i HATE rap, but eminem's rap is sooooooooooooo good! in this cd, the beats to his songs, are so cool! and in one song, his daughter is in it, and another, eminem SINGS! not raps!  this is my fav cd ever, i truly reccamend it.  the clean version is good, cuz why do we need the curses?? i LOVE THIS CD!
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album is the showcase that Brian wilson begged his label to let him make. What you see here represents the greatest album of American history, and shows what music hacks the Beatles were. Everything that Paul and John wanted to be, Brian Wilson captures with his soulful, mournful songs. Pet Sounds captures youthful exuberance mixed with typical teenage depression-simultaneously. Pet Sounds isn't the peak of the Beach Boys harmonizing style. This is a Brian Wilson production through and through, Mike Love didn't even like this album. While only a modest commercial success, it only gets stronger with age.
B000069HKH|4.0|The Rising is Bruce Springsteen's best album since Tunnel Of Love which was released in 1987. Producer Brendan O'Brien has brought a new sound to both Springsteen's sound and songs. The addition of the violin and the way that the drums were recorded are refreshing to hear on a Springsteen record. Springsteen's sound has matured through the years but has still retained it's edge and power which continues to move his audience as well as bring new listeners to his music. There are several great songs to enjoy here. Nothing Man is beautiful, and Let's Be Friends is a great pop tune. Into the Fire is also outstanding. Springsteen now in his fourth decade of being a recording artist, really has nothing left to prove and yet The Rising is an album made by an artist who is still hungry to challenge himself and his art. The E Street Band sound as good as ever. This record should be nominated for the grammy for album of the year. My only critism of this record is that the Big Man did not get enough solo spots but I would like him to solo on every song that Springsteen writes because I love his playing so much!
B000069CWE|4.0|When I bought this CD I never heard the remixed versions on the album. When I saw Aaron Lewis's name next to Crawling and Jonathon Davis next to One Step Closer I had to buy it. When I got home, I couldn't do the normal routine of listening to the whole CD, I had to go straight to Crawling. The violin and cellos add to the mix of Aaron Lewis's amazing voice and Mike Shinoda's strong lyrics this song was instantly a hit. Then, I went back to the beginning. In The End was totally changed thanks to Kutmasta Kurt and Motion Man, but this song still cam through along with X-Ecutioner Style and High Voltage as the top three songs on the album. The only flaw that I noticed with this already perfect album, was the length of music before the lyrics begin, sometimes it gets annoying to hear 2 minutes of violin before even hearing one lyric. And the only other flaw noticed, was on the two tracks I was most excited about. One Step Closer and Crawling should have had more of an influence from the strong voiced singers, Jon Davis and Aaron Lewis. Both songs could have been much stronger with more lyrics layed down from the two singers. Still, Linkin Park stands strong with an off the hook album that is going to stay in my CD player for a long long time.
0380820846|3.0|This was a nice book..If I had not read the other books in this series first, I think I would have liked this one better. The reason being that I quite honestly adored Colin from the earlier novels, so, when I found that he was to have his own book..and then to be paired with Penelope!!!..I was ecstatic!!!!! However, I feel like..well...where was the romance? It was a sweet story, but I wanted more details..I felt like their feelings for eachother were lukewarm. What killed me the most was ....what the heck happened to Colin? He seemed to have lost all of his appeal in this book. Dont get me wrong..this was sweet and I was charmed by Penelope, but I think there could have been less focus on Whistledown and more on Colin and Penelope's relationship. Oh well...Im still glad that I read it..and I'm most definitely going to jump at the chance to read about Eloise.
0316666343|1.0|I do not believe that this book got a rating beyond one star!  I did not find this book interesting, in fact, it was very creepy and depressing.  I bought this book for the interesting details of heaven. The author failed to bring this alive...she made heaven seem like a cold and lonely place. The charcters were all lifeless and a bit selfish...they seemed more concerned with themselves....

B000069HKH|5.0|&quot;The Rising&quot; is quite honestly a beautiful work of art by a man and a band that are very good at playing songs together.  This album is over 70 minutes of great tunes one after another.  Complete with deep lyrics, and deep emotions throughout the songs.  &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; kicks this album off very well, and into &quot;Into the Fire&quot; which seems to hint at 9/11 with the choral line talking about people's hope bringing hope, etc.  I love &quot;Nothing Man&quot; it just seems so chill and kind of haunting with thought out lyrics, it is reminiscent of Secret Garden and Philadelphia.  You can't go wrong with this album, there is not a bad song on this album.  For bliss listen to this and Dave Matthews Band's Busted Stuff for two and a half hours of great music!!
B000069CWE|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS COMPLETELY AWESOME. WHOOOOOO MY MOM KICKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR PLAYING IT SO LOUD! BUT THAT'S OKAY. CAUSE I STILL HAVE THE CD. A DEFINITE MUST BUY FOR ANY LINKIN PARK FANS! WHOOO!!!

6301174240|3.0|With any hard-core MJ fan, you can't go wrong with this movie..even through it makes basically NO sense whatsoever. Not really a movie, but more of some small plots superglued together with some really cool music videos. <br />In between Michael excaping claymation groupies & paparazzi, he also battles drug lords, saves the children, destroys a 30s-era club with a machine gun (long Smooth Criminal video), turns into robots & cars & still has time to shake his thang wearing skin tight black leather pants & singing a cover of \\"Come Together\\"....just another day for Michael Jackson.<br />but let's get back to the MUSIC & even better let the VIDEOS to them. the highlights here are the videos, the long form Smooth Criminal video, featuring some of the BEST Michael Jackson dancing on film (imo anyways), the funky 80s-era special effects of Leave Me Alone.

0812550757|4.0|I would assume that most readers of this book would be those who recently read and were excited by Ender's Game.  If you are a fan of Mr. Card's writing then you will probably enjoy this book - but BEWARE!  It strays quite a bit from the light story telling and fun of Ender's Game and is a much &quot;darker&quot; book.<br />I enjoyed it, but only when I looked at it on it's own merits and not as a sequel to Ender's Game.  Unfortuately, Ender's Game is a must read if you are going to really follow the characters and story in Speaker for the Dead.<br />I guess it's hard to follow Ender's Game - but did Mr. Card have to take such a turn away from what made Ender's Game great?  Still a good read on it's own merits - just don't have Ender's Game-type expectations.
0553269631|5.0|I loved this book for its brutality, though that wasn't the only criterion. The prose is stylistically beautiful, and McCullers makes good use of shifting tones and dialects: Though the book is seen in third person, the passages spotlighting each character assume the diction of that character. The characters are believable and well-crafted, and there are ideas harbingerial of future crises. Jake Blount's Communist sympathies are vocal only a decade short of the \\"Red Scare\\" and McCarthy's obscene witchhunts; and in Doctor Copeland's war on racial oppression are hints of the militance and demonstrations of the Civil Rights movement only two decades past. It's not a matter of prescience, but a matter of a writer making good use of contemporary events. <br />The brutality I alluded to is not entirely violent, nor sexual as the blurb suggests. The dust jacket referred to this as an \\"Innocence Lost\\" parable, with the minor event of Mick Kelly's unmaidening apparently labeled the pivotal event. The climax is in fact the death of John Singer, the genial deaf-mute. Singer becomes an advocate and friend to a menagerie of damaged and impotent small-towners. Singer is the more successful of two confidants, the other also-ran being Bif Brannon, the proprietor of the New York Cafe. Brannon sticks up for the \\"freaks\\" and rejects who wash up on the streets of the town, part of which commiseration may be accounted for by the fact that he is himself an oddball, a romantic who collects old newspapers and dreams of having children even as his wife suffers with cancer. Or his sympathy could stem from aa simple sense of ennui. Though this is less likely, there is given evidence for both contentions.<br />Of the two, Singer is the more inviting, while Brannon is the more stable. Naturally Brannon is a bit suspicious of Singer's always open arms. <br />But Singer's attachment to his friend Spiros Antanapolous is the prevailing relationship. It is clear that Singer sees in both his new friends and in Spiros not only lonesome bedfellows, but a collection of people to coddle and sympathize with. Singer exorcises demons and allieves his own dejection with kindliness. When Spiro's kills himself, Singer realizes that all the relationships he's built can be just as easily broken as was Spiros. His suicide is not entirely due to his sadness at losing his friend, but at the sadness he predicts at the unavoidable loss of his new friends. As the novel is building to its crescendo, the characters are seen crumbling under the heft of strict and unfriendly southern ethics and society. The dream Singer has is support of this: Spiros naked at the top of the stairs represents Singer's ideal mate, a frail and vulnerable person put there for him to take care of. Singer is naked to his new friends, and they are naked to the captious town and family who fail to understand either their own unhappiness or that of those four. When Singer meets the mutes in the pool hall and can't relate to them, clams up and becomes uncommunicative, it is because he has exhausted all his understanding and intellect and energy on other people's behalf.<br />The unflinching portrayal of human hurt is worthy of twice as much paper and ink, especially with McCuller's handling.
0812550706|5.0|This book has become a classic in the sci-fi realm.  It is an extremely entertaining and fast read.  It is defintely on of Mr. Card's best works.  But even if you love this book, be careful on it's sequels - they are very different in story and tone.  If you're looking for a great follow up - try &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; - which is the same story told froma different character's point of view.  I know it sounds kind of forced and trite, but it is actually very good and will give you what you want if you're an Ender's Game fan.
B000000645|4.0|I finally got around to comparing the CD and the vinyl and my suspicions were confirmed: the attack on the CD is more assertive, the ambiance is somehow more jarring, brassy, overly bright.  By comparison, the vinyl is softer and, to my ear at least, much more listenable.<br />What do you think?

I just wanted to post this because I am young (19) and I really want to apologize to all music-lovers on behalf of the young fellow that says N'Sync is better than the Beatles. That's absolutely preposterous! I don't even know what to say. .... N'Sync, better than the Beatles? What's the world coming to!? Well, to each his own I guess. (NOT!) One thing's for sure, if musical taste was available for purchase, I'd definitely he go out and buy some. :)
B000069HKH|5.0|Into a world that needs more rock and more relevance, Springsteen delivers both. &quot;The Rising&quot; is stirring - stirs your heart, your soul, your feet. Its messages of hope, loss, faith, survival and bravery run through this memorable work. And you can dance to it. This is for folks who still think music matters.
B000025XKM|5.0|I first got into Nick Drake when I downloaded some tracks from Bryter Layter (also a great album), but when I first heard Pink Moon I was blown away. What this album lacks in length (28 minutes) it more than makes up for in pure musical brilliance. There is a lot to be sound for the beauty of one man and his guitar. For my money Drake is the finest lyricist of the 20th century; Parasite is my personal favorite from this album. Coupling his lyrics with his whispful yet powerful voice creates a feeling of honesty that seems so rare to find anymore. His guitar playing is absolutely exceptional, ranging from rhythm rich picking and strummng (Things Behind the Sun, Parasite) to the the plaintive sparseness of Horn. A truly masterful work, a must for any fan of the singer/songwriter genre. Actually anyone who considers themselves a true fan of great music should own this album.
0780622553|5.0|one of the best ever.  As simple as that.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I was a fan of The Beatles beginning in about 1966, and though I had heard much of their earlier music, I was influenced by my parents to be listening more to country at the time, so I wasn't exposed to their earlier music very much until years later.  Listening to \\"One\\" and putting myself into 1962, and considering the type of music popular at the time, I can see something of the effect The Beatles had on popular music then, to now, and into the future.<br />This CD has 27 songs that were #1 in either The United Kingdom or the United States.  As pointed out by others, these songs include some of The Beatles best songs, but not all of their best songs.  These songs were popular, not necessarily musically great.  However, being popular means that those of us over the age of 40 probably remember nearly every single song, if not all.  If you are below the age of 40, I would still be willing to bet that you've heard many of them, likely some of them covered by a newer person or group.<br />For those of you looking for a primer for The Beatles, this CD is it.  It covers the two periods from 1962 to 1966 and 1967 to 1970.  For those of you who do not know why The Beatles career is broken up into those two periods, I'll explain.  Generally most of the music The Beatles made from 1962 to 1966 was relatively simple, three guitars and drums, with occasional visits by other instruments from time to time.  In mid to late 1966 The Beatles began to be very experimental, adding other instruments, trying various technical effects, adding orchestras, and generally trying to grow their music.<br />Up until now the only way to get a good cross section of Beatles music has been to buy 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 at pretty high prices.  Now you can listen to a slice of music from both eras cost-effectively.  Once you've heard \\"One\\" you can decide whether you want more Beatles music.<br />You can argue that long-time Beatles fans will be disappointed for various reasons.  Maybe.  I have a lot of Beatles music and still bought this CD because it presents a particular aspect of The Beatles on one CD.  There are other times when I'm in the mood to play \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Revolver\\" or whatever, but then those albums are appropriate to my mood.  This CD gives me another option to listen to a great group.<br />I am always distressed by sound quality arguments.  I admit that I am working with a simple, $400 stereo, which isn't nearly what some of the audiophiles have.  On my stereo this CD sounds fine.  I suspect that most of us are casual listeners that just want to hear good music.  The sound quality of this CD is fine for that type of listening.  For everyone else, better go spend the money to find the vinyl versions.  I admit, they are better, but they are prohibitively expensive and increasingly difficult to find.<br />These songs are great.  I recommend this album as a good starting point for a new listener.  Once you've heard these you can decide which Beatles you like the best and buy albums from that era.  I do recommend that if you are new to The Beatles that you buy albums.  \\"One\\" is a narrow range of selections.

B000005IU2|5.0|The Stooges \\"Funhouse\\" is totally pure, and spews from the guts and souls of these truly rare & unique artists who were many decades ahead of their time. Listen to it, digest it and then listen to it again and again. Soak it in. You will never, ever experience a sonic onslaught like the one created by this legendary album of the highest order. \\"Funhouse\\" will forever be appreciated more and more as the sands of time trickle away. Part of the genius of the Stooges is that only a \\"precious few\\" can hear & feel the sacred magic in their timeless works. You can bet your life and soul that this album will be treasured one thousand years from now and beyond because it ranks in the upper echilon of Earth's many masterpieces...and Iggy Pop will always be remembered as one of the most electrifying frontmen in the history of music.
0316666343|5.0|It's been quite a while since I have a read a book that I did not want to end. I felt like I was right behind Susie Salmon at every turn and able to view the story in the same method she did. Richly drawn characters, all of them necessary, and not a wasted word in this beautifully written book. I wont give a synopsis of the story as many people do because I find it a wast of time. I will say that this book took me places. I would literally have to be interrupted at a lunch counter one day with my face close to the page so my lunch could be served. Do yourself a favor and read this heartbreaking and dare I day heartwarming book.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Once again another \\"band\\" taken over by main stream pop. This album will disappoint all fans of the earlier No Doubt considerably. The songs are repetitive and bubble gum to the last, without the meaning or intensity of their punk/skaa predecessors. Fans of Britney or N*Sync, will probably enjoy it very much, but other people looking for good music should try elsewhere.
B00005JKJA|3.0|This is one of the very few movies I ever felt compelled to watch twice in one night.  So, why not give it five stars?  The move deserves the five stars, the DVD does not.<br />The DVD has essentially no value added material.  It should be priced accordingly, yet it carries a premium equal to other new, popular, full featured DVDs.  <br />Just a plea for rational pricing.
B000063DFS|4.0|Indeed, this is one of those records you shouldn't miss! Fortunately for all of us, this new 24 - bit remaster wasn't [messed up] up like the other recent Ozzy re - releases. There is no reason to cry (therefore, \\"No more Tears\\"), here, as pretty much every song smokes! Actually, I used to like this record a whole lot more a few years ago, when I originally bought it, but still.<br /><br />When I heard it was coming out with extra tracks, I lost no time and got it immediately. The only reason I rate this with 4 and not five stars is because 5 stars are, as far as I'm concerned, exclusive for Ozzy's records with Randy Rhoads. After well over than a decade, songs like \\"Mr Tinkertrain\\", \\"Mama I'm coming Home\\", \\"Desire\\" and the title track still sound amazing. Other songs, like \\"S.I.N\\" and \\"I don't want to change the world\\" are also great, but for some reason, \\"Time after time\\" and \\"Road to nowhere\\" don't strike me as much as they used to... don't get me wrong, they are terrific songs, i guess i just changed a bit over the years... \\"Hellraiser\\" is fine, but i do like Motorhead's version better. The band, comprised of guitarist Zakk Wylde, drummer Randy Castillo and bassist Bob Daisley, is in tip top shape, turning up some of the best performances ever heard in an Ozzy record. Most of the songs are guitar heavy, and Zakk is the undoubteddly the one we have to thank for that, going far and beyond what he had already shown on the previous album, \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\". The Ozz himself is in good shape, too, and if you ask me, this was the last record where he actually sounded killer.<br /><br />The bonus songs? Quite good, actually:\\"Don't Blame me\\" is by no means an apology from Ozz, but rather a cool rocker, and \\"Party with the Animals\\" is another uptempo number chockfull of great guitar playing and an excellent overall performance. Just one question,though: is it Ozzy going ape, or is it a real gorilla doing those sounds at the end of \\"Party with the animals\\"? No, I'm just kidding... Buy the record, you won't regret it, as it is Ozzy's last truly great rockin album, now with a crystal clear remastered sound...Enjoy!Buy the record, you won't regret it, as it is Ozzy's last truly great rockin album, now with a crystal clear remastered sound...Enjoy!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I saw previews of this movie and thought that it looked really stupid. Well, to my surprise the opposite was true! Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are great in this movie! Ben Stiller has got to be one of the most underappreciated actors of our time. He is multi-talented and gets little recognition for it.<br />I love Ben's facial expressions and his weird voice. I thought the walk-off scene was pretty stupid though.... other than that, this movie was great. It is a stupid comedy, not something that all people will like but I think it's worth your time to watch. The DVD also comes with some funny clips such as a scene where ben stiller is talking to zoolander and Zoolander says something to the effect of&quot;oh you use those big words just because you graduated from 'high school'&quot; Ben responds &quot;enough&quot; Zoolander says, &quot;Oh now you're making up words!&quot;<br />I loved this movie and I highly recommend it!
0385334206|5.0|Have you ever thought that you were the only sentient being on earth? That everyone else was an automaton designed to test your reactions? That history and events in faraway places were simply constructs intended to cause you puzzlement or momentarily pique your interest? That there were far too many coincidences in this life to ignore forever the workings of a omnipotent (and quite possibly insane) Creator &amp; Instigator?<br />Vonnegut wrote CHAMPIONS as a birthday present to himself and he takes the opportunity to meditate at length on what it means to &quot;play God&quot; during the act of writing. He pushes his characters around the middle American landscape of his mind, devises horrible, dull, or joyous fates for them, and salutes them as they endure all his torments and whimsy. <br />This is one of those books that can change your life. I read it when I was 14 or 15, and then read it again 4 or 5 times. I suppose I wanted to make certain that I had soaked up every ounce of divine madness in the book. I had read SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE previously, but this book set me off on a Vonnegut rampage, I devoured everything he wrote in a matter of months. CHAMPIONS opened my mind to the idea of &quot;writer as Creator.&quot;
B00005KFUM|5.0|This album is the epitome of why Americans are lagging in the world of music.  While we continue to idolize and deify acts such as Kid Rock and more recently Creed, Muse has created a rock album so agressive and angst filled that Limp Bizcut would tuck their tails and run in fear.  Unfortunately, Muse's promoters are amongst the most ignorant I could think of, as this album would make a killing, ....  With such a raw sound, even to the breathing being extremely pronounced (not overproduced), this album is what any music enthusist needs.  Muse creates agression in the right way, and we are not treated like drone by listeningas as the music is complex and new (even using concert piano in several songs). ...
B00005ATZT|4.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire time and was great fun! It is a clever, well-directed thriller that also features great performances, especially from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.<br />The Fugitive, which is based on a TV series, is the story of a Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a man wrongly convicted of brutally murdering his wife. After the bus carrying him to prison manages to crash into a train (impressive special effects on the crash scene), Kimble escapes then attempts to solve the mystery of who actually killed his wife. At the same time, however, he has to keep on the run from an obsessive detective (Tommy Lee Jones) who is as determined to find him as he is to stay free.<br />There are many exciting twists and turns in the plot, which involves a one-armed man and a medical fraud...and to say any more about it would be to give too much away. Anyhow, this is one of the best recent thrillers - it has some great scenes, good action sequences, some comic moments, great acting (Ford and Jones are perfect...you simply root for whoever is on screen at the time), and is not TOO violent (although some of the initial scenes which show the wife being murdered are pretty grusome). This is one of the few recent Hollywood blockbusters that actually deserves its popularity - see it and enjoy!
B000069CWE|5.0|The cd Linkin Park:Reanimation is probably the best remix album i've heard! It's amazing how they still keep the original beat mixed in with the new one. This cd has it ALL and somehow the rapping was the perfect touch to make this cd the best. If you're a major Linkin Park fan like me you would already have it. I really liked the \\"In The End\\"(Enth E ND)remix. With all the other remix albums i've heard, this one tops ALL! And with 20 tracks you HAVE to have at least one favorite.<br />IN SHORT...THIS CD ROCKS!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|In this era of buying albums for a single song, or at best two, what a joy it was to put in this disc, turn it up and really enjoy every track!  Not often do I find music by anybody that really works, at every level, on every song.. but Springsteen comes very close with this album.  I've always admired Springsteen during the E-Street days, and not so much without them.. this brings it all back together, and has quickly jumped into my top 20 of all time, and may move up further with future listenings and lyrical review.. great album.. a must have!
B000063V8U|5.0|This is the ultimate season of Star Trek:The Next Generation. In this, the sixth, season you will see one of the all time best episode(s), 'Chain of command'. Patrick Stewart delivers an emotional and brilliant performace as the prisoner of war in the hands of a Cardassian interrogator. Another priceless gem in season six is 'Frame of mind', an episode featuring Jonathan Frakes in superb acting and a high quality script by Brannon Braga.
0553213105|5.0|Blinded by beauty, Mr. Bennett married his lightheaded Mrs., and ever since has been skewering her with his wit--with beauty faded, she remains lightheaded and his target.  Five daughters later, his estate is still slated to pass to a distant cousin, an obnoxious clergyman, because it can pass only to a man.  Had there been a son, something could have been done, but as it is, the daughters' only hope of avoiding eventual poverty is marrying well, for themselves and for their mother.<br />  Our focus is on the second daughter, Elizabeth.  More thoughtful than her sisters, she is her father's favorite.  We are not the only ones to like Elizabeth, the prideful and immensely wealthy Mr. Darcy also finds himself falling for her.  She rejects him because of the prejudice she has formed from his foster brother, the untrustworthy Mr. Wickham.  The rest of the novel allows us to watch as these characters manoever to finally get into a position where they can accept each other.<br />Absolutely stuffed with memorable characters and scenes.  I rate it as her best, slightly better than Emma, but reasonable minds can differ about this one.
B00005B36H|5.0|Starting with the Alex Grey artwork, the concept of this album is significantly brighter that Tool's previous works.  That is not to say that Tool has lost their dark appeal, but their music has evolved magnificently into something that is as thought provoking musically as it is lyrically.<br />Take, for example, the King Crimson-esque meter changes throughout the album.  The Grudge and The Patient both are entirely in 5/8 and 5/4, while the Grammy-award winning Schism is in a mix of 6/4, 9/4 and 13/4.  In addition, Ticks &amp; Leeches melds from 7/4 to 4/4 halfway through the song, and Lateralus exists in both 5/8 and 6/8, sometimes, simultaneously.<br />Through this album, Tool teaches a lesson, many so-called 'artists' would do well to learn from.  Vocalist Maynard James Keenan actually sings.  Guitarist Adam Jones introduces the novel concept of forming actual chords despite his use of drop-D tuning (drop-D makes the bottom 3 strings D-A-D, or root-5th-octave, which makes a power chord ridiculously easy).  Bassist Justin Chancellor has a habit of actually using the full range of his instrument.  Finally, drummer Danny Carey has musicality and technical skill comparable to that of the great John Bonham.<br />These are all great reasons why Lateralus should be a part of any discerning music appreciater's collection.
0316666343|5.0|Don't be put off by the premise of this novel.  The Lovely Bones is a wonderful, hopeful, moving read.  The story is narrated by Susie Salmon--a fourteen year-old girl who in the opening moments of the novel, informs us that she is dead--brutally raped and then murdered.  That's the worst of it--right there.  The novel is her story, what heaven is like (Sebold's version of heaven is nothing if not comforting), what her afterlife is like--watching her family and friends struggle to move on.  Susie's story is interesting and unique.  This novel would have been quite depressing if told in the third person, if all we saw were the grieving friends and family.  Instead, we see it all from Susie's perspective, as she tries to comfort them, tries to help them move on.  The most wonderful part of the novel, though, is how it makes you feel as you read it--something difficult to convey in a review.  Sebold fills the novel with emotion, without allowing it to become sappy and over the top.  The ending is very satisfying.  OK, maybe it tied things up too neatly--but because of the subject matter, the best it can be is bittersweet.  I urge anyone who is interested in The Lovely Bones to read it.  Don't be put off by what appears to be the subject matter.  This really is a truly emotionally satisfying novel.
B000069CWE|5.0|wow.  This CD is amazing.  I thought that all the DJs would butcher the songs and the feel of the music but they did an awesome job.  Im not a big fan of remix cds after listening to the Limp Bizkit one because the djs completley ruined all of the songs, but my opinions have changed.<BR>Every track is amazing on this album especially Aaron Lewis's KRWLNG.  It might possibly be better than Crawling.  If you are a Linkin Park fan( I know there is a lot of you guys out there!) this the cd for you!  Drop whatever you are doing and buy this cd NOW!
B00005JL3A|3.0|While the actual story line behind the movie is genuinely good and unique, it's extremely underdeveloped. The vast majority of the film's 101 minutes is spent focusing on flesh eating zombies. Yes, you read that right *Flesh Eating Zombies*. If that just happens to be something your into - more power to you! But if not, you might want to make this one a rental. Aside from the zombies, the story keeps you interested, it moves along quickly, the special effects are good, and it gives a nice sequel suggestion at the end.

Sure, this album has darkness about it, but Bruce's music always has, just like it has light moment, such as &quot;Mary's Place&quot;.<br />This album is fantastic. If any artist could talk about the post 9/11 world and do it justice and give it dignity, it's Bruce Springsteen. &quot;The Rising&quot; is a touching tribute to the firefighters and &quot;You're Missing&quot; is just absolutely haunting.<br />The album should be picked up by all, but for those who remember Bruce for &quot;Glory Days&quot; and &quot;Born In The U.S.A&quot; only, and not noticing the body of work that exists, you might be disappointed.
B00005BJ2O|1.0|I bought this CD expecting the soundtrack of the actual movie. (Crazy idea, I know.) Isn't that what a soundtrack is? This is not the movie soundtrack.And I am furious and disappointed that it is not what it says it is.
0316666343|5.0|This book was absolutely incredible. Ms. Sebold captured not only the obvious processes involved in grieving, but also the hidden shards and slivers that are buried deep inside.<br />Not only did she paint images that leapt off the page, but she managed seemingly effortlessly, to give the soft, quiet, often silent and therefore even more agonizing emotions of grief form. An invisible fog that rose up and engulfed me.<br />I have lost two people that were/are in my heart. I have discovered, at least for myself, that the horrendous pain dissipates after time, but that the haunting longing for loved ones lost remains. It is not a constant emptiness on the surface of my emotions, but it is always there, lingering somewhere deep inside me. I have wondered, occasionally, at those times when my loved ones have popped into my mind without obvious reason, if it is because they are thinking of and missing me. And, if, in their longing they haven't come by for a visit and on some level I sense them. I wonder if just as Susie watched her family, my loved ones occasionally watch me.<br />The person who felt that the book lost its punch and should have followed the murderer really missed the point. It was not a book about hunting down a serial killer, (try Patricia Cornwell for that)it is a book about loss and how that loss can effect so many lives. It is a book about grieving and finding ones way through the pain and confusion of devastatiing loss and ultimately finding a way to let go.<br />If I could give this book a rating beyond the 5star scale, I would give it 10!
0451191153|5.0|This is in my top three novels of all time.
1557131678|3.0|The stories are well written, easy to follow and maintain a consistent flow. Which is all very commendable because this is difficult to do. But the greatness stops there. The characters are likeable enough, but for some reason, I did not care about them. I can not explain why either. Gradually, I just lost interest. Perhaps it was because of the style of the author. Possibly, the text is too perfect. By that I mean that it lacks passion, energy and  --- elan -- or something. Again,  I can not put my finger on. Auster seems to be like a voyeuristic, transcendent being, detached from the world, watching things from above, simply recording events like a court reporter...... I really wanted to like this book. I just couldn't.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce Springsteen listens to how the person in the street reacts -- to pain, to love, and to loss.  Here, he offers a look at several of the universal human reactions to 9-11.  As before, he preaches endurance but also hope.  That's not to say that the music doesn't also stand up well on its own, even with repeated hearings called for by the words.  This is a keeper.

0738206679|5.0|Mathematicians have been studying and modelling networks for nearly three centuries, ever since Gauss puzzled out the arrangement of bridges in Koenigsberg. By half a century ago, there was a vast literature of tens of thousands of papers on what had come to be called \\"graph theory.\\"<br />The big surprise is that no one ever tried to model the growth of networks, or to compare the models with large, spontaneously occurring networks in the real world, until the late 1990s. Barabasi was in on the ground floor of those fledgling efforts, and luckily for all of us to whom real world networks matter (nets of business associates, of friends, of interlocking corporate boards, of Internet nodes, web links, power grids, and half a dozen other major examples to be found here), he happens to have a great gift for clear, lively explanation.<br />Barabasi's style is *crisp*: it crackles with the excitement he feels for this exploding field of study; there's enough real substance for us techies to get our teeth into (rather than skipping the few formulas, he sequesters them in footnotes); he waters down nothing, and still makes everything seem simple.  (Partly this is because the subject *is* relatively simple. It's been built from the ground up in just the last few years, so understanding it doesn't require understanding a lot of previously built technical machinery.)<br />It turns out that all the very different real world networks I listed above have, allowing for a certain modicum of randomness, the same life histories, the same adult form, and a penchant for obeying the same laws.<br />First, all of them are \\"small worlds.\\"  The average number of \\"degrees of separation\\" for the friendship web in the U.S. is clearly less than 6.  The maximum number of links separating two of the 800 million public web pages around in 1998 was under 19. The average distance between any two stars in the Kevin Bacon game is less than 4. And so on.<br />Second, the links aren't randomly distributed at all. There's a \\"the rich get richer\\" phenomenon, in which early members of the network acquire more links, and nodes with more links are more likely to acquire new ones.  Count and plot the number of links, and you'll get nothing like the familiar old bell curve. Instead it looks like what's called a \\"power law\\": the lion's share of links go to a handful of power nodes, which Barabasi calls \\"hubs\\" - think Amazon and Google. Most of the rest go to a larger, but still very small, collection of nodes. And so on, down to the vast array of the Johnny-come-latelies and also rans, with their two or three connections to the network.<br />A critical question these days is: how robust are these spontaneously grown networks?  How resistant are they to failure? And the reassuring answer is, that even when you remove an enormous number of nodes, a quarter or a third of them, nets like these stay up and working and connected. The less reassuring answer is, that all these networks are highly vulnerable to deliberate attacks. If saboteurs adopt a take-out-the-hubs strategy, removing only a few dozen can reduce a network of millions of nodes to fragments.<br />One of Barabasi's most intriguing examples is the network of chemicals in a living cell, where two chemicals are \\"linked\\" if there's some reaction involving both of them.  The hubs turn out to be water, and the energy transporters ATP and ADP. But the degrees of separation are atypical among all the networks discussed, which raises some fascinating evolutionary issues.<br />I have only one complaint: I was left thirsty for more detail on everything.  And only one quibble: he enthuses at one point that mapping out the biochemical network will make the search for effective drugs a breeze, whereas it seems just as likely that it will make it plain that the search is impossibly hard. After all,  many of the classic examples of NP-complete problems come from the older (and, being static rather than dynamic, simpler) realm ofgraph theory.<br />In an ever more interconnected world, all of us are plugged in to a battery of dynamic networks. So Barabasi's book has vital application to every reader's life. How fortunate that he has made it so easy for every reader to grasp the shape and the rules of the linked life.
B000066I6N|4.0|Recent releases from Tom Waits, David Bowie, and now Robert Plant demonstrate that good quality music is alive and well.<br />This is a great album. Period.<br />Only weak point seems to be the recording. I cant understand why there is distortion at the start of the second track. Tape hiss (and a bit too prominent) on others. I also found the sound quality of Clarksdale lifeless. This music deserves better mastering.
B000065U1N|4.0|I will echo one previous reviewer's comments:  The movie is terrific, and a lot of other reviewers can fill you in on the details of the movie itself.  The DVD package contents, however, are pretty underwhelming.  This seems to be Hollywood's new game; release a base version of the movie on DVD as soon as possible, than, around X-Mas, re-release a \\"special\\" version.  The fact that this DVD doesn't even include original Trailers for Blackhawk Down (instead for Spiderman and one other forgetable movie) is ludicrous.  <BR>I bought it, because I wanted to see it, and ***may*** upgrade to the inevitable \\"special\\" version when it is released.  My advice: If you have waited this long, you may want to consider holding out a bit longer until a better DVD version appears.  I reckon that to be around October, but a quick search of some relevant websites would confirm the actual date.  <BR>The movie is worth the money.  Just hope you don't buy this version today, than feel ripped off when they release a much more complete DVD shortly.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I saw this movie on opening night at the movies and again a week later with my freinds.Ever since it came out tuesday I watched 3 times and once with the commentary[Which is th funniest I'v ever seen].I hope they make a sequel to this movie.Also the DVD is packed with plenty of extra features;such as behind the scenes and plenty of trailers of upcoming movies.They also show how they got the makeup on the actors who played the zombies and how they created the Licker.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I love horror movies, but I'll have to admit, coming into this one I was not expecting a great movie.  I mean, come on, what video game turned movie ever is.  From the previews, it look as if there were barely any zombies and most of the monsters were the zombie dogs, a computerized girl, or Nemesis.  After viewing the trailer, I was dissapointed b/c, quite frankly, the zombies are the scariest part.  I am glad to say that I was pleasantly suprised.  The movie was great, the acting was wonderful, and there were more zombies than I could shake an machine gun at.  I went with my wife to see this and I swear, she spent most of the movie with her head buried in my arm, and she doesnt scare easily.  The only downside to the movie was that the beginning was a bit confusing, but it all makes since as time goes on.  If you like to be scared and on the edge of your seat, this movie is for you.  But dont go into it comparing it to the video game, because as you have probably already read, its not like the game.  Just forget the game even exist and view this title as just an A+, action packed horror movie.  No, RE fans, its not like the game......its better!
B00002EPMF|5.0|Control Denied's album is without a doubt Chuck Schulinder's finest hour in terms of writing songs.  Unfortunetly, it seems the album has the lyrical tone of a man condemned.  It seems with this album Chuck is trying to spread a message with his songs, particularly \\"Expect the Unexpected\\" and \\"Believe.\\"  <br />The music on this album is nothing short of jaw-dropping.  Especially \\"Consumed,\\" which has a great opening bass line.  Musically, I would put this album ahead of Death's \\"The Sound of Persevearance.\\"<br />All in all, any fan of Death or any power metal group will enjoy this album.  This album is denfintely one of the top three to come out in 1999.  Buy it and enjoy.

B000069CWE|5.0|Who can forget the awesome Hybrid Theory album Linkin Park released a few years ago. Well if you think you'll get the same sound by getting REANIMATION, you just may be in for a big suprise. But don't worry, Reanimation is money very well spent. For those of you who are not familiar with Linkin Park, you may put this CD on and say...&quot;hmm..what's this?&quot; But I have a feeling that you will quickly learn to love this very unique album. And for all you verteran Linkin Park fans out there...you will immediately value the beauty of REANIMATION..especially since you'll know where all these songs originally came from. Just about every song sounds different than the original version in some way or another but they will surely please the ears and mind of any true Linkin Park fan. And I give a Linkin Park a big salute for adding My December and High Voltage to Reanimation. These two songs were from back in the day when the band was known as Hybrid Theory and does nothing but add to Linkin Park's credibility as being one of the best bands in the world. So sit back, relax, and absorb this wonderfully put together piece of art. You will soon agree with me that it will be well worth your time.
006051048X|4.0|I really liked this story.  Although Amazon.com lists the reading level as ages 9-12, this is really a great read for older readers as well.  It's about a girl named Coraline.  She's bored and explores everything in her family's new flat and outside of it.  She has quirky neighbors, parents who don't have time to play with her at the moment, and the flat has a door that opens to a brick wall most of the time.  When it doesn't, it opens to another flat, exactly like the one her family lives it.  The food is better there and everything is more interesting.  Unfortunately, her other mother and other father want her to stay there forever.<br />It's a bit predictable at times (for instance, I realized where Coraline's parents were long before she did), but the story is interesting and creepy.  It's been a while since I've read anything that put shivers down my spine like this book did.  Gaiman's voice didn't always make the story seem very creepy, but the bits where the rats are singing are definitely worth a few shivers.  Just a quick note on the cd version, though.  Although it's great hearing Gaiman read it, it might be better to get the audio cassette version of it.  That way you'd still get to hear him read it and you wouldn't have to deal with the way the book is divided up in the cd.  When I listen to a book on cd, I like it best if each track (part of the book) is short, about 5 minutes long, since you can't just stop a cd and be at that exact spot a few hours or days later.  This cd breaks up the book at each chapter, which means the tracks are each anywhere from 9 to 22 minutes long.  If you don't mind that, that's great, but I just thought I'd warn those who do mind that sort of thing.
B000001E18|4.0|This is an excellent album and complements Achtung Baby quite well.  I think the only reason this album isn't that good is that it was written on tour and was inspired by the music that made up Achtung Baby.  It takes the mockery of themselves and technology a step further than Achtung Baby.  I actually think this album is meant specifically for this purpose while Achtung had many underlying themes that were presented metaphorically.<br />Specific examples would be Zooropa and Numb.  Lemon is also a great song though definitely no the typical U2 song while Stay does fit in this category.  The conclusion with the Wanderer and Johnny Cash on vocals is excellent.  With the electronic influenced sound of the album and Cash's voice, you get an interesting feel.<br />This album proves that the advances U2 made musically with Achtung Baby continued to Zooropa (and actually one more step with their Passengers album).  This album was the climax of their progress in this period.  Of course All That You Can't Leave Behind is also progress but of a different sort that I won't get into now.<br />So, this is a great album and demonstrates the versatility of U2.  It is great to have a group where every album is distinct.  It keeps things interesting and has for the last 25 years.
B000069HKH|5.0|I can't describe the emotions going through me the first time I played track #2 &quot;Into the Fire&quot;.  Only Bruce and Steve Earle, two of the greatest Story teller songwriters of our time (sorry Mr. Dylan) can move me with their words like this track does.<br />The album on a whole is fantastic.  I can never tire of listening to a Springsteen record.  It is haunting yet, uplifting.<br />Check this one out..
B000001FS6|3.0|I am a huge U2 fan and even I'll admit this is not their finest effort. Quite simply U2 tried to do too much too fast in the wake of the Joshua Tree.  By comparison they did the same thing with Zooropa following Achtung Baby, but that was more successful.<br />What you get on this CD is a combination of some live material for the Joshua Tree Tour, some songs which are just fantastic in that mode, and studio rechordings.  I particularly find the live version of \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" fantastic.  \\"I Still Haven't Found...\\" is great here with a backing gospel choir. As for the new songs, I think the standouts include \\"All I Want is You\\" which is a sequel to \\"With or Without You\\" , \\"Desire\\", \\"Hawkmoon 269\\", \\"Silver and Gold\\", and \\"When Love Comes to Town\\" with BB King.<br />My biggest complaint about this album (and even the movie) is that U2 seem to be trying to win America over, as if The Joshua Tree didn't already do it.  I think with a little more time they could have produced a full studio album of new songs (considering the awesome B-Sides that came out of the accompanying singles) and a full live album.  Of particular note are the absense of some wonderful live songs that were in the film and not on this album.  \\"With or Without You\\" from the movie is spectacular and even better is \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\".<br />Oh well, this album does provide a nice perspective on what U2 were feeling at the end of the 80's on the heels of the success of the Joshua Tree.

B000069HKH|5.0|Well some people might say that Bruce is taking advantage of the 9-11 situation to sell records, but anyone who listens to this will see that it is a superb album that reflects a more of a positive attitude towards the whole incident.  The lyrics are superb and bring out various aspects of life post 9-11.  Bruce acknowledges the feeling and need of vengence without promoting it.  He acknowledges the sorrow of loss and moving past it. I am quite sure this album will be album of the year.<br />The music is very reminiscent of all the great Springsteen and E-Street band songs of the bast with a great upbeat tempo.  The Rising is the first great song that everyone will know, but other songs such as Worlds Apart, The Fuse, and even Empty Sky follow up on this.  In fact it is hard to find a tune that lacks the upbeat rhythm.<br />In all, this is definitely among Springsteen's finest works.

B000002J1L|3.0|Released in 1971 Nursery Cryme is Genesis’ third album and sees the band finally playing with its definitive line-up. Mr. Phil Collins makes his first appearance on drums, new guitarist Steve Hackett helps fatten out the sound with his potent fretwork, ke yboard virtuoso Tony Banks and bassplayer Mike Rutherford reach new heights in songwriting and arranging while Peter Gabriel is a veritable fireworks of singing ability and deft phrasing. Nursery Cryme is not quite as good as Foxtrot or Selling England By The Pound - the band was still deveoping its sound - but has its fair share of strong moments. Return of The Giant Hogweed is an epic tale of giant predatory plants escape captivity to wreak a terrible revenge on the human race, and features that tradema rk Hammond organ sound that characterises early 70s music, Nursery Cryme (a live favourite) is probably the flagship song here - Genesis' Stairway to Heaven - although for my money, Fountain of Salmacis steals the show, a dazzling piece of songwriting and musicanship (Genesis still played this song live in the 80s),<br />To sum up, Nursery Cryme is a varied and thoroughly enjoyable record, although Foxtrot I think has the edge when it comes to Gabriel-era Genesis.<br />oo
B000069CWE|4.0|Those who bought this cd expecting to find rock remixes of tracks from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; were sorely mistaken when they purchased the cd.  This cd contains &quot;re-interpretations&quot; of all 12 tracks from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and some even remixes of tracks that were previously unavailable to the US.  <br />You can't really call this a &quot;remix&quot; album like P. Diddy and J-Lo have done because all they did was re-think the beats.  Linkin Park DEFINITELY re-do the beats, but on most occasions, they offer different lyrics as well.  Like the track &quot;ENTH E ND,&quot; Mike Shinoda and Motion Man offer different lyrics to a Raukus Records-esque hip-hop beat.  It's really different and really entertaining.  However, The best tracks come at the end and are not hip-hop influenced.  &quot;1STP KLOSR&quot; and &quot;KRWLNG&quot; are the tracks that feature Jonathan Davis of Korn and Aaron Lewis of Staind, respectively.  Both artists add their completely different, yet hypnotic voices to the tracks.  Each one's voice make the track stand out just that much more than how Chester Bennington was able to do on the original album.<br />Overall, I can't give this album 5 stars because even though it is revolutionary, it's not the best album it could have been.  &quot;MY&lt;DSMBR&quot; is too techno for my liking and i still prefer the original over the remix to that song.  The four skits are pointless, but nonetheless, seem requiste for any album nowadays, except for &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; which had no skits.  Still, despite some minor flaws, this is still a great album and i highly recomend it to anyone.
B00000099Y|1.0|Any music that you need a college degree to get through just ain't for me, Da Peace Dogg.  I'm all about opening your horizonz and stuff, but dis album is just radiculous.  Maybe if Tool did a &quot;Behind Da Music&quot; episode they might be more accepted and troo.  <br />Some of these songs span 10 minutes or longer!!  What's up wit dat!!  Plus, the guy singing seems to be on morphine or sumpthing, and I've never seen is face in videos or on TRL with my boy Carson Daley.  I just can't get into this stuff like I can Creed.<br />It's a real shame too, cuz these guys had troo talent when they started.<br />LATER!!
B00000DGUG|1.0|I loved Jagged Little Pill because it left me feeling charged - the music was energetic and powerful, and it left a listener feeling on top of the world. I could only get myself to listen to Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie all the way through once because it had much more of a &quot;why me, woe is me&quot; feel to it that left me wondering, &quot;wow, what happened to her?&quot; I bought this album a month after it came out; I haven't listened to it since. It is an artistic album, but not what I would have expected from the person who created Jagged Little Pill.
B000067G3C|5.0|I had forgotten how much I enjoyed &quot;Speed&quot; until I saw it again in its newest DVD transfer.  Forget about the plausibility of the plot, since if that were the standard to judge action/adventure movies, how many would qualify? Instead, enjoy the non-stop excitement, with &quot;Armaggedon&quot;-type pacing where each solution is followed by another problem.  <br />The movie is basically all-action, all the time, and that's what those of us who love this genre want.  If you're looking for profound dialogue or character development, you won't find it, but you will find lots of humor thrown in to lighten things up.<br />Keanu Reeves gives a glimpse of the sort of intensity that he would bring to the &quot;Matrix&quot;, and Bullock is about as believable as anyone could be behind the wheel of the bus. The two of them establish a good chemistry and this definitely lifts the film above the run-of-the-mill.<br />Dennis Hopper is his usual maniacal self as the crazed villain, and Jeff Daniels does a credible job as Reeves' partner; the two of them had some great lines at the beginning of the film.<br />The DVD transfer is excellent;  the video is clear and well-balanced with minimal digital artifacts, and the audio will give your surround system a real workout.  I haven't looked at the second disc yet but it's loaded with extras.  <br />Bottom line:  for a classic adventure flick with an outstanding new remastering, this Five Star version of &quot;Speed&quot; can't be beat!
B00005QFE5|4.0|The movie is pretty good, but I was really taken by the soundtrack. Where can I get it?
B00000G3PA|5.0|This is one of my favorite action-adventure movies of all time.  For one thing, you have Bruce Willis in a role that could have been created with him in mind:  arrogant, cocky, inflexible, and the best driller in the world.  Throw in a group of equally skilled misfits and a love story subplot between Ben Affleck and Bruce's daughter, and non-stop action with killer special effects and a soundtrack to match, and you've got a great evening's entertainment.<br />The plot is simple:  a killer meteor is heading toward Earth, and Bruce and his crew of drillers are sent to drill a hole in it, drop in a nuclear device, and detonate it as they speed back home.<br />The visual effects are quite good, and the audio is outstanding, with excellent use of the subwoofer and the surrounds to create an entire sound environment.  For action/adventure fans, this movie is essential.
6302820448|3.0|Groundhog Day is a very entertaining film though it's more of a romantic comedy than a plain one.  Bill Murray (Stripes and Ghostbusters) is Phil Connors, an insulting and mean news reporter.  When he is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover Groundhog Day, he thinks it's going to be a simple come and go routine.   However, he gets into a blizzard and is forced to stay.  The next day he wakes up and immediately wants to leave when he sees that is Groundhog Day..again.  At first he's confused but after waking up each day and seeing that the day is the same as the last one, Connors begins to take advantage and soon turns into a nice and good guy and gets himself the producer (Andie MacDowell, Hudson Hawk)  With a good cast including Chris Elliot (Snow Day) as a cameraman and Steven Tobolowsky (Hero) as an idiotic insurance-seller named Ned, this movie is pure fun for the whole family. It's directed by Harold Ramis (Stripes).  He makes a brief appearance as a doctor.  Very good!  Reccomended.  Compliment: Kind a get's boring after viewing it about five times.
B00005V9IK|5.0|I know that a lot of people dislike this movie because it's not the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of sci-fi/alien movies, but I think it does a great job of entertaining, and I have watched it many times.<br />The plot is thoroughly described in other reviews, so I won't belabor it here.  Suffice to say that its implausibility is really irrelevant, and for most viewers, that will not be a problem.  <br />What I liked about the movie the first time and on each successive viewing, were the great special effects (I cannot understand the reviewers who found them to be deficient) and the way that humor is used throughout the movie.  I also enjoyed the subplots and the fact that the characters are developed enough to be individuals, not just a group of anonymous Earthlings.<br />Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith are great together, and seem to be enjoying themselves.  The other actors are good in their roles, too.<br />Some people are critical of this movie for not succeeding as a patriotic movie, or for trying to be one in the first place.  I agree that some of the President's appeals to humanity might sound hokey, but within the context of this movie, it didn't seem out of place to me at all.  The movie sets out to accomplish a few basic goals, the primary one being to entertain the viewer, and on that level, it succeeds as well as any other recent film of its type.<br />The DVD has excellent video and audio.
B000066I6N|5.0|This CD is a recording of older cover tunes...songs that the artist has said were some of his favorites through the passage of time.  He has taken a unique approach.  Instead of copying them exactly the way the original artist<BR>recorded them, they have been reworked to sometimes sound like completely different songs other than those originally written.  Plant sings them in strong, passionate vocals accompanied by the progressive sound of his band, Strange Sensation.<BR>Although Plant uses a different style of singing than that which characterizes his past career, he continues to illustrate the joys and pains of what it is like to be human...his trademark.  As is customary with this artist, it is as if he has lived his life in the listener's shoes.  Further, this work creatively expresses the energy of living in the uncertain circumstances of our current times.  <br />DREAMLAND is in a class all by itself.  It cannot be catagorized into any single genre of music, as the sounds of blues, folk, hard rock, arabic as well as the use of modern technology can be identified.  It is the combination of these mingling styles and Plant's timeless voice that give the songs a futuristic promise as well as a reminiscent visitation from the past.
B000000OMB|5.0|As a teen of the '80s, I loved classic rock (still do), including many of the bands that the members of ASIA were alumni of ie ELP, Yes, King Crimson, UK, and others.  I saw them on the ALPHA tour, which was before the personel changes started.  I love this album possessing the great qualites of the era with great guitar playing, fluid vocals, and cathy rhythms.  Prog rock never sounded better or more accessible.
B000069CWE|3.0|Well, this is definetly a different CD than &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;..but it isn't as good. Nothing is as good as Linkin Park's first! Anyways, this CD has remixed all 12 songs from Hybrid Theory and added their all new verses. Some songs are slowed down, some are speeded. They have 8 new songs, that weren't in Hybrid Theory. I recognized a few songs from &quot;Hybrid Theory EP&quot;..Overall, I didn't really like all the remixes, I was looking for new songs by LP. Well, guess I'll have to wait until January '03 when LP's next CD is expected to come out. <br />If you're a LP fan, than you should get it. If you are into Techno/Rap this is also good. If you were more into Chester than Mike, there's a dissapointment, because Chester isn't featured as much as Mike, and rap is the main genre in this CD. This isn't really a &quot;rock&quot; CD, but it's ok. LP fans will like it!

0553801481|5.0|Finally! Great beginning of a new adventure. I went to the library and took first 3 \\"Assasin..\\" books and read and liked them again, even more than when I read them first time (read \\"Ship of Magic\\" trilogy twice already). Powerfull characters, well thought-out and 3(4!)-dimensional world. How very strong and refreshing. It's not some Wheel-of-time-like helpless and endless and beyond-boring wordchow. Excellent author! I consider Robin Hobb and Guy Gavriel Kay easy two top 5 star authors in fantasy world. <BR> The only flaw with the book - I somehow did not like this Jinna character as an (obviously) Tom's next love story, it just did not click it with me. I want Molly back!!!! I know, I know... impossible..., life is not all milk rivers and honey banks for you. I am going miss you, Nighteyes! Will Tom bond again? Is it time for Nettle to enter the scene? We'll see what happens next. Cant wait for the second book.<BR> Strongly recommend all series for a serious fantasy reader!
B00005JL3A|4.0|First of all, let me say that I had a preconceived opinion about this movie before I saw it.  Being a hardcore fan, I thought it would go the way of Super Mario Bros.  Much to my surprise, however, the movie turned out to be less a cold attempt to make quick cash then a proper tribute by real fans, as well as a fun ride.  Milla Jovovich plays Alice, a woman who is suddenly sucked into a mission to infiltrate an underground lab called the Hive, which has mysteriously killed its inhabitants.  Unknown to Alice, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), and the rest of the crew, everyone down there is now a flesh-craving zombie.  It's not deep entertainment, but it's fun as anything.  Just rating the movie, I'd have to give it five stars, for a movie which gives a fan like me everything he wants (including Milla in minimal garb, but I digress).<br />My rating takes its one star plunge when the DVD itself is analyzed.  Most of the extras are just fine.  The French students among us can listen to it dubbed or subbed in Francais.  You can watch it in widescreen, and you can check out the filmographies of five members of the staff.  It also contains a music video for \\"My Plague\\" by Slipknot.  I wasn't interested in this video, but that's just because I'm not a fan of Slipknot.  It's all about taste in that department.  The trailer section, however, pulls my least favorite of tricks.  Instead of offering the many different tv spots, teasers, and trailers, it offers you one trailer for \\"RE\\" and four more trailers of random other movies.  But this is just a pet peeve.<br />The real clincher for me that decided its three star rating was the commentary.  It presents the situation of four (the most I've ever heard) people in a room: Milla, Michelle, producer Jeremy Bolt, and director Paul W.S. Anderson.  Because of this turmoil, the commentary plays like having four people behind you at the theater: three film students, and their ditzy blonde friend, with Milla playing the part of the latter.  I loved her as Leeloo, and I think she's an accomplished and attractive actress, but damn, is she annoying.  The commentary rarely answers any questions that the viewer might have about the film, and when the director or producer is about to, Milla typically interrupts to talk about her topless scene, or something else trivial.<br />On the lighter side, the commentary does provide some fun moments.  It becomes clear after twenty minutes that all four are devoted to the video game series, and Michelle sounds like a die-hard fan of my own caliber, spouting reference after reference.  Also, it's kind of funny when they go off on tangents.  There's a hilarious moment when Milla and Michelle are arguing about one aspect of the movie, while at the same time, Paul and Jeremy argue about the music of the film.  It's obvious that they don't take the commentary too seriously, and they apologize for it routinely, and inform you that the real answers will be given in the production designer's commentary.  Unfortunately, this commentary doesn't exist.<br />All in all, I gave the DVD 3 stars, and the movie 5, which obviously averaged out to 4.  If you want a good horror or sci-fi flick, or are a big fan of the video game series, this DVD is just right for you, and it's not too expensive either.  Otherwise, you might want to just stick with a rental.I loved her as Leeloo, and I think she's an accomplished and attractive actress, but damn, is she annoying.

B000069HKH|5.0|After all the hype surrounding the release of The Rising, it's hard to know what to say, other than...yes, it really is that good!<br />If there's one thing that sets this album apart from its predecessors, it's the degree to which all of Springsteen's past styles mesh together here.  Up to now, we could choose between the working-class hero of the early LPs, or the folkie of &quot;Nebraska&quot; and &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad,&quot; or more adult arena rocker who emerged sometime in the late '80s and has turned up since then on the occasional movie soundtrack.  This time, they all seem to appear front and center at some point, and the result is something not quite like anything that's come before, but instantly recognizable as the same great talent we know and love.  As the boss himself proclaims in the album's opening verses, &quot;The joke's on me/but I'm gonna be okay!&quot;<br />As has been widely reported, the memories of September 11 are everywhere here.  But in his usual fashion, he sings of our national nightmare in terms that anyone could relate to after enduring a tragedy.  &quot;You're Missing&quot; is simply one of Springsteen's most brilliant creations ever; there's no doubt as to what he's referring to in this sketch of coming to terms with a sudden and mysterious loss, but he leaves just enough details out for any listener to see the tale through his or her own eyes and circumstances.  The closing track, &quot;My City of Ruins,&quot; is a more overt tribute (as the name suggests), and its refrain of &quot;come on, rise up!&quot; is just what we could all use today.<br />Instrumentally speaking, this is indisputably Springsteen's most unorthodox effort yet.  (Who would have expected the &quot;additional musicians&quot; credits to include hurdy-gurdy and glockenspiel players?)  Occasionally it sounds entirely too mainstream, particularly in the case of the overdubbed strings on the opener, &quot;Lonesome Day.&quot;  Elsewhere, though, he makes great use of a single violin from Soozie Tyrell - perhaps he's spent the decade since his last rock album studying roots rock.  He even tries his hand at synth-style percussion(!) on &quot;The Fuse,&quot; but stirring lyrics save that one.  Overall, it's clear that he hasn't strayed too far from the recent past.  &quot;Into the Fire&quot; struck me as what most of the songs on &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; might have sounded like if he'd let the band join him on that outing.  &quot;Nothing Man&quot; is keyboard driven, mellow but unsettled like &quot;I'm On Fire,&quot; while &quot;Waitin' On a Sunny Day&quot; and &quot;Mary's Place&quot; offer a welcome serving of his trademark sax and piano rock and roll.  Most adventurous of all, &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; lives up to its name by fusing Middle Eastern stylings with classic American rock, while the lyrics tell a succinct tale of love across an unidentified but rigid political divide.<br />Like a lot of us, it seems that Springsteen's concerns of the moment have pushed his old fondness for girls and cars to the sidelines.  But alongside the serious subject matter, his sense of determination and love of life in the face of adversity are still here in full force.  Bruce by the numbers it ain't, but if you liked ANY of his previous changes in pace and style, you'll appreciate this.
B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising is right up there with Nebraska for it's soulful thoughtfulness, yet it really rocks in other areas.  For the first studio album for Bruce and the E Street in 18 years, it delivers everything that Bruce fans could hope for.

B0000640VO|5.0|The Amelie DVD is so wonderful because of all the extras.  You already know what an excellent movie this is so I don't need to address that in my review. ....  I completely indentify with the character Amelie and grew up under similar situations as she.  The sex in the movie is insignificant.  As an only child and one having strained relationships with her parent(s), and also being that she did not attend school, relationships are an especially strange concept and she doesn't know how to deal with them.  She's not necessarily a shy character, but she does not know how to act with people.  She's become very observant because of this.  The reason she feels something for Nino is inexplicable and nothing like before, since it's only a feeling she's gotten, her destiny.  She has not had that feeling before.  And so even though it was awkward at first, she did not know how to go about things with him, when he's there at her door everything falls into place.  If you watch the movie repeatedly like I do, or at least decide to give it a second go-round, this will all be apparent.  In fact many many many more things will become apparent or subtly apparent as you watch this movie again and again.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|A fairy tale for everyone.  Witty, good natured humor for kids and adults.  Animation in the movie is excellent, as well as sound quality.  If you don't own this movie, its definitely worth purchasing!
078401213X|1.0|Ok this movie was pure garbage. The idea behind it was good but it was badly directed. First of all it was friggin black and white. Piece of trash movie! Im glad I don't own it! Don't buy it unless you are a math major @ MIT!
0767805712|5.0|Suspenseful and engaging, this movie was well directed. It questions issues in society, including genetic screening and predetermination.
0393312836|5.0|Ahhhh our humble narrator poor little Alex. I first came across this book in a box filled with musty old books like it, and as soon as i opened it's pages, i could not put it down. I have since read it approximatley 20 times. This is my favorite book of all time! Burgess takes you on the horrorshow journey of Alex and his four droogs (friends) and all thier violence, rape, and total sadisim. When double crossed, Alex (who is 15 in the book, 12 in the movie, if i'm not mistaken) is eventually is used as the first test subject in an experimental reform process, in which he cannot even think about violent acts without getting terribly ill. He is then thrown out into the real world where he must face all of his victims, who still haven't forgotten, or forgiven, who he was. Burgesses' story of inborn goodness vs forced goodness in one's own personality is a tale you soon won't forget. While some people found it tiresome, if you love a challenge, this book is filled with new foreign words, and do not be surprised if you must read lines over and over again to get their full comprehension. Read the book over the movie, b/c the movie is based on the american version without the last chapter, a crucial part of the story.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Fast and the Furious delivers exactly what the previews promised... a fun to watch movie with great special effects.  The digital surround sound makes you feel like you're in the movie.  No, the plot isn't superb, but no one actually watched this movie for the drama.
B00001U0DP|4.0|Benigni is brilliant.  Only he could pull this off.  Thank you, Roberto, for your sense of life and spirit.
B00000K19E|2.0|Contary to what has been written about this film, I don't see anything ground breaking, but only cliche'.  The reluctant messiah story is as old as Buddha, Jesus, and Burt Reynolds in the Longest Yard.  Even worst, it takes forever to more this tired story along.  I felt insulted as a viewer with average smarts by the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; reference.<br />For all the CGI hype, it is just that.  Slow motion bullets with trails have been done years before in &quot;Sniper.&quot;  I am surprised that the few scenes of over the top gun play where the good guys never get hit still plays with the young who seem to love this movie.  There is nothing visionary about taking bad Bruce Lee knock-off fight scenes and put them to slow motion.  <br />Production value and cinematography is a disappointment too.  Under exposure, and bluing doesn't create a mood, but does creates good night light of two plus hours of sleep.
0385503954|5.0|Excellent novel - one of the best I have read in ages, however - to all other reviewers, please do not give summaries of the plot as anyone wishing to read the book on the strength of a review will inevitably have the novel spoiled.<br />The characters &amp; plot of this novel are fantastic.
B00005T33W|1.0|I rented this movie based on a recomendation because I was looking for a quirky comedy. I was feeling a bit down, and wanted something to cheer me up. This was NOT the movie that I should have gotten.<br />The movie dragged on. It was so slow, that it wound up making me MORE depressed, because I felt like a loser just watching the movie. One of the reviewers compared the dialog to Daria. I disagree, as Daria is about 30x funnier than this thing.<br />I'm guessing that all the good reviews are from people that relate to the main character. I'm a bit confused why that's enough, because it seems that the main character doesn't have anything good about her. The movie does not portray her in a good light at all; it serves only to seem to point out WHY she is a loner, rather than showing that loners don't have to be pathetic geeks. If I related to her, I would have been offended that she was portrayed in the very stereotypical way that every other movie out there does for the misfit. The only difference is that she's the main character rather than some side bar and that there aren't \\"popular\\" kids as a focus.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Let's face it:  The animation looks creepy.  I've always thought so, and I stand behind that.  But Mike Myers is wonderful, Eddie Murphy is a delight, and my 13-month-old son is transfixed every time he beholds Shrek.  How bad can it be?
0312958455|3.0|\\"The Last Coyote\\" is the first of Connelly's Bosch novels that I have read.  I enjoyed the story thoroughly.<br />LAPD Detective Harry Bosch is very much a flawed hero.  Throughout this novel he is on adminsitrative leave from his job as a result of having assaulted and battered his lieutenant boss.  He decides to use the idle time (when not in sessions with a charming female police psychologist whose recommendation will determine whether or not Bosch is restored to active service) looking into an unsolved murder from 1961.  The victim of the murder was none other than Bosch's prostitute mother.  Bosch's unauthorized investigation leads to some very powereful political figures and puts not only Bosch's job, but also his life and liberty in danger.  There are villains galore, but even the villains may not be all bad.  Part of the intrigue of this book is that it shows there can be a fine line between good and evil, and in the end Bosch has to come to grips with the evil of his own ways.<br />The story is fast-paced, and it is nice to read about a hero who is all too human.  The plot is entertaining and involves enough surprises to keep the reader guessing up to the very last page.  <br />My only criticism is that I found some parts of the book -- for  example the descriptions of Bosch's exact street routes from one place to another in Los Angeles -- a bit tedious at times.  Also he uses some awkward sentence constructions that bothered me.  I find that when a writer's style attracts my attention negatively, it distracts me from my enjoyment of the story. <br />Still, \\"The Last Coyote\\" was an excellent, fast and compelling crime novel that kept me awake far to late a few nights just because I wanted to find out what would happen next.
B000067DNC|5.0|I have been waiting it seems forever for the release of Season 2, not to mention Seasons, 3,4,5 and 6 as soon as it is completed.  I have followed this show from the beginning and taped every single episode from day one.  It is smartly written, the casting is awesome and the intricate weaving of mythology, special effects and modern day issues is unparalleled in my humble opinion.  Buy every season!!
B000069HKH|5.0|Last fall, some nuts took down two big buildings about 15 blocks from where I live. All day, I watched the survivors march uptown. Droves and droves of suits, covered in that insidious gray dust, filed by in shock, disbelief, and guilty thanks. In the days that unfolded, Mayor Rudy--relentlessly pressed by the media--finally said the death toll would be more than we could bear. Somehow, a miracle happened. 12,000 to 20,000 became 5,000, and, once the dust truly settled, 2,800 were confirmed lost. But not quite, at least not to Bruce. Man, he captured the victims of that awful moment, without victimizing them. This is not a trite tribute to the NYFD. It's about lives suddenly torn apart and cast adrift in a sudden moment of shocking violence. Reading the lyric sheet (you have to) made me well up once again. As we move on, or stumble, as a nation on the hunt and a city uncertain how to rebuild, Bruce takes us back. Not to Ground Zero, but to Zero Hour. And to the lives and the individuals who felt 9/11 more than anyone in Washington, more than any of us will ever know. Bruce has nailed the unimaginable personal angst of children never seen again and lovers lost. Initially, I was put off by the E Street Band, which seems to have preserved its sound in ice these past 18 years. The more I listened, though, the more I welcomed the familiarity against Bruce's haunting lyrics. Rudy was right. Even 2,800 is more than we can bare--especially for those who were left behind. And, even as he invites the rising (becuase we have to move on), Bruce makes sure that the soul--and souls--of that awful moment remain in our minds. Bravo to the Jersey Kid for that.

0312952813|3.0|Christmas in California and detective Hieronymus \\"Harry\\" Bosch is on call. So begins another fast paced, action packed, mystery thriller by Michael Connolly. Listening to the LAPD scanner, Bosch sits at home alone \\"enjoying\\" a roasted breast of turkey and a glass of red wine while he savours the ceremonial opening of his three Christmas cards.  A cryptic message in cop-speak from the scanner brings Bosch back to reality and, abandoning his Christmas dinner, he heads off to a dingy motel room and a corpse.  Initially it looks like a suicide but certain aspects of the case worry Bosch who is certain it is a homicide.  The victim is a police colleague and all the circumstances of his death and the events leading up to it provide a deeply tangled mystery.  Is there any link with another homicide in town which the dead cop had been investigating? Is there a link with the new \\"Black Ice\\" designer drug being distributed around town and in particular with its source over the border in Mexico? <br />The excitement of the novel builds as Bosch gradually strips away the shrouds of mystery like layers of an onion, but still seemingly getting nowhere.  Romantic interludes with the late cop's widow and the thrill of  his undercover, even illegal, investigations in Mexico bring the drama to a climax.  The reader has to give his/her imagination free rein remembering that this is a work of fiction and that anything goes.  Our hero really is a hero and good must surely triumph over evil.  Relax and enjoy the ride.  This is not Michael Connelly's best novel but it is far from his worst. It sits comfortably in the middle of the pack and most regular Connelly readers will find it an enjoyable and escapist adventure story.
0767836286|5.0|Great film. Some action, but primarily this one makes you try to figure out what is going on.<br />You begin to think one thing, then start to second guess yourself only to find out that there is entirely something else happening. And the end is incredible. After you watch the film and start to think about it, you begin to realize how large the plot really was. Definietly need to see it a second time to pick up on the small things.<br />Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins! Both played their parts unerringly.<br />If you like movies that keep you riveted to your seat the whole time, this one's for you.
B000069CWE|5.0|With the variety in this remix CD, it makes sense to rate it track-by-track, as compared to the original and on its own. 5 tracks are interludes, so they won't be rated. Here we go:<br />2. Pts.Of.Athrty - 6/5 stars - Jay Gordon injected a certain pulse to this song with a heavy drum beat and compelling guitar sounds. The vocals remain fairly intact as per Hybrid Theory, with some sound effects. Overall, a genius performance, meriting 6 out of 5.<BR>3. ENth E Nd - 6/5 - An addictive beat coupled with nice scratches, wonderfully remixed electronic piano that is faintly reminiscent of the original, and rap stylings from Kutmaster Kurt and Mike Shinoda make this one a total success.<BR>5. Frgt/10 - 4/5 - The remix is very rap-inclined, moreso than the original, which seemed to me to be rock-inclined with heavier guitars. Still a nice listen, with a steady beat and new lyrics, but if you bought the first for the rock, you won't enjoy this one as much as the rest.<BR>6. P5hng Me A*wy - 5/5 - Retains a light, far-away drum beat, even through the chorus, which features new lyrics. I personally think the song would be suited better with a heavier overtone in both the drums and the lyrics, but as it stands, it's perfectly fine.<BR>7. Plc.4 Mie HÆd - 5/5 - A sparse beginning riff and beat are followed swiftly by a heavy chorus. Picks up near the end with a heavy, constant riff and hard drums, and the yelling throughout. Great song, but the only good part is after the bridge near the end.<br />8. X-Ecutioner Style - 3/5 - A quick scratch-fest with lyrics performed by friends The X-Ecutioners. Surely for the rap listeners; rockers can skip this without much remorse.<BR>9. H! Vltg3 - 3/5 - Behind pretty much the whole song is piano. The downside is that it's the exact same note over and over and over again... quite annoying. The presence of absolutely any riff behind it would've helped it some.<BR>11. Wth>you - 7/5 - Half the reason I bought this thing. 'With You' was, IMHO, the best song on Hybrid Theory. In the beginning, the difference isn't quite so apparent (and almost doesn't exist), but the bridge is a whole new verse that brings out the true meaning of the song and a wonderful piano accompaniment, which carries to the chorus. Absolute genius. Best on this album.<BR>13. Ppr:Kut - 6/5 - The theme of paranoia in the original is brought out by rampant lyrical repeat effects. The bass line, though sparse, adds depth. The chorus, though short, is very energetic, with a riff that will make your heart speed up. The whole song, including the rap section, makes your heart race and really conveys the panicky insanity in the lyrics. Success.<BR>14. Rnw@y - 5/5 - Steady beat and new lyrics compose the verses; the chorus is quite repetitive, though. The fast rap bridge by Backyard Bangers picks up the beat a bit. A nice listen, but gets tedious.<BR>15. My{Dsmbr - 6/5 - Here's where the album picks up. The addition of real, audible drums creates contrast with the relaxing musical effects, Kelli Ali's calming voice, and the original message. That's what makes this song so great. Undoubtedly an unforgettable experience; has a psychologically stirring effect on the disenfranchised that riles you for the upcoming final songs.<BR>17. By_Myslf - 6/5 - Heavy drums and sparse, heavy guitars mingle with Chester and Mike's lyrical energy to keep you interested in the beginning. The addition of Joe Hahn's synthesized sounds in the final pre-chorus dominate the song and leave you begging for more.<BR>18. Kyur4 Th Ich - 6/5 - Joe Hahn includes a nice beat with mystifying scratches and effects on lyric samples from the band's earliest material (when they were called Hybrid Theory). This song succeeds with flying colors, even without true lyrics.<BR>19. 1Stp Klosr - 5/5 - It's the DVD remix with an added verse and final chorus voice by KoRn's Jonathan Davis. The beginning is quite tedious; fans of the original are let waiting for quite a bit (2 minutes) for anything that really resembles it. After the first verse is a chorus played to the aforementioned tedious music, which leaves much to be desired. Davis then kicks in; his additions double the energy put forth from the original.<BR>20. Krwlng - 6/5 - Perfect for the end of the album; the violin throughout reminds you of the opening violin, both of which are by Phoenix. This makes you want to start the whole album over again. The song itself is, throughout the beginning, quite like the original, but the lack of heavy drums allows your energy to subside quietly. Their appearance later leaves you waiting for more. Aaron Lewis' voice adds power and emotion to a song that's already a cesspool of feeling. All of the ingredients here work together to form the perfect ending, and for this, merits the extra star.<BR>Overall: This is truly the work of musical genius. Though much of the foundation, Hybrid Theory, was left to shrivel, what we now have retains the best and adds better. Even the amazing, makes-you-jealous artwork reflects that this really is a new beginning to something that was exceptional to begin with.
B00004XONN|5.0|Absolutely the most intoxicating, mesmerizing CD of all time. I just must listen to it once a day.
B000002L3P|4.0|Kenny Wayne shepherd burst onto the scene as a young major league guitar slinger. A couple of releases later and he seems to have disappeared.Kenny Wayne earned and deserved all the accolades given him.Ledbetter Heights was and is still an excellent CD. Mostly originals with a few covers thrown in, Ledbetter Heights is his most bluesy effort.He has a solid and talented band.I have no preferance between Corey or Noah on vocals , both are strong singers.<BR>Shame,Shame,Shame is my favorite cut, a great blues jam.Kenny has a great extended solo that hints at Stevie Ray. Born Under a Bad Sign, Deja Voodoo and Aberdeen all enjoyed radio airplay and are fine blues\rock songs.Aberdeen is a Bukka White song, it starts with acoustic sound with some slide guitar and then the band kicks in, theres plenty of slide guitar fills its a cool song.While We Cry sounds toooo much like The Allmans song Soul Shine, but it is a good showcase for Kennys deft and subtle touch. I'm Leaving You is a Howlin Wolf song played ala SRV. Let Me Up is a true blue Texas shuffle, short but sweet.Riverside sounds like a haunted night on the bayou ,very eerie.The last two tracks sound like filler material to me, not bad ,but not up to the standards set by the rest of Ledbetter Heights<BR>My hope is that Kenny will put out a CD that will pay tribute to all the blues legends he mentions in the liner notes. Ledbetter Heights gave me a taste as to how good he can be.One day he will be mentioned in the same breathe as these greats but he will need to release more great Cds like Ledbetter Heights.
0671042734|1.0|In his Smiley sequel, this bloke has filled countless pages with the most boring stuff.  He cannot hold my attention for more than a few phrases at a time.  Mr. LeCarre writes like a pedant and probably is one, fills the cliche of Honorable Schoolboy, that's why he could fill page after page with nonsense maintaining best behavior with a straight face.  There is no doubt that he is a Tinker, less Tailor or Soldier, failed lousy as Spy.  gerborg
B000069HKH|5.0|I love this guy!  Another classic.  Those who will complain that &quot;there's not enough Clarence,&quot; or, &quot;no songs about cars,&quot; just don't get it; and that's OK.  There are plenty of artists who don't really have much to say beyond the scope of their early works.  Bruce has grown up; and if you can handle a few less sax solos, he's worth paying attention to.  <br />The writing on this record is absolutely stunning...the musicianship better than ever.  &quot;You're Missing&quot; is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard...right there with Beth Nielsen Chapman's &quot;Sand and Water.&quot;  There's no preaching here...but oceans of empathy.  There are no wild calls for vengence...but plenty of pain, survival, and hope.  <br />With all the hype of the new album...a new producer...all the talk about how &quot;this sounds different than anything we've ever done before...,&quot; I was prepared to take my time digesting this material.  No need.  For all the &quot;new sound&quot; talk, there's plenty of influence from &quot;The River&quot; and &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;.  And for all those who don't even acknowledge he's recorded anything since &quot;Darkness,&quot; there's &quot;Mary's Place.&quot;  All that's missing is the &quot;hey-hey-hey-hey&quot; ending... it's '73 all over again! <br />Thanks Bruce!
B00001QEBQ|5.0|I saw this on a whim in the theaters, and was amazed at the breath-taking scenes, the amazing (and that's amazing, not really catchy and annoying like Disney has been putting out) songs, and how funny it was.  Eddie Murphy was so hilarious--and you really have to listen, because the humor can be subtle.  I never get tired of seeing this movie.  I highly recommend it!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I think Enrique Iglesias has come a long way since he appeared on the charts with No Llores Por Mi.  He's shy, he's sexy, he's honest (No Llores Por Mi says the most honest things I've ever heard a man say when ending a relationship- hats off to Enrique for that).<br />The July 16th reviewer said there are only a few songs on the album - what cd do you have?  There are 10 songs on this cd, of which 9 are original material and one \\"Sad Eyes\\" is a Bruce Springsteen cover - included as a tribute to the Boss since he was an early influece on Enrique.  Spanish language recordings are also included for three songs; for me these recordings are a bonus, not a drawback.  In any case, I think anyone reading these reviews should skip the July 16th review because the reviewer doesn't seem to know what s/he is talking about.  I don't think that the reviewer has listened to the disc let alone purchased it.<br />Enrique has stepped away from the Latin American pop music which shot him to the top of the charts.  Other than singing in Spanish and some distinct Latin rhythms, there isn't much trace of his roots on this album.  Some songs, such as \\"If The World Crashes Down,\\" seems influenced by an ultra dance pop sound i.e. Erasure or Pet Shop Boys.  The sound works well for Enrique.  I think some of his vocals are sometimes (not always, not often) slightly weaker in English than they are in his native Spanish but the album isn't, by any means, weaker because of this.  <br />This album is less evidence that Enrique has sold out (though it is a sure bet to thrust him to the top of the charts along side other contemporary singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston and sure to knock out any competition from the likes of Boy Bands.  I would really like to hear Enrique do a duet with Melissa Etheridge, K.D. Lang, Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Tina Turner, George Michael (this would be a great pairing of styles - George Michael has demonstrated his own diversity (musical- that is) over the course of two decades of chart topping dance numbers and moving ballads.  A collaborative effort with Robbie Williams or Pet Shop Boys would also be a great creative coupling.<br />For anyone who has been a long time fan of Enrique, this cd will not be disappointing.  For English only speaking people who have just \\"discovered\\" Enrique, this album and his first English album \\"Enrique\\" are must haves.  But I would say, go out on a limb and get his debut cd \\"Enrique Iglesias\\" (Spanish) and his third release \\"Cosas Del Amor\\" (Spanish).  Those two albums are filled with wonderful pop music, some of the best of the 90s.<br />!!! Vive Enrique Iglesias!!! - and tour in Chicago soon and often!
0812548094|5.0|It is a great book and its sequals are great to.
B00003CX5P|5.0|i have seen this several times since buying it. True Star Wars fan will really appreciate this DVD. There are several hours worth of special footage and if you have a DVD-ROM in your computer , check it out. It takes you to a specail website. Nice.
B000067CPX|5.0|I have listened to the RHCP's since I saw them back in 1984 at little place in Santa Monica called The Music Machine.  It's awesome to see how they have evolved.  Life is all about change and growth and this cd exemplifies both.  I love this CD.  Thanks to the band for sharing there best with us.  I am loving this CD, it's the only thing I want to listen to right now.  Favorite tracks, Dosed, By the Way, I Could Die For You, On Mercury, This is the Place, but all are works of art.  Thanks RHCP's! Keep singing!:)
B00005QG9J|4.0|Firmly there are six songs you will play over and over again.  That's six, not the full album.  But what does that mean?  Girating pleasure for the full mix.  Though I haven't heard the acclaim I hoped it would get, take it from a pleasure seeker that Morning View does its duty, and will show a face to modern rock that has lacked; heavy-headed structure.  My personal pick is track 8, Warning.  These guys are something that few others are; smart.  They're not System of a Down or GnR (also Los Angeles), but maybe an advanced eightees band that never found their sound.  If you want your ass kicked in modern music, and you have a system loud enough to entertain them, go for it.
0783235615|5.0|1969's TOPAZ was Hitchock's second return in that decade to his earlier spy thriller films. Shot directly after 1966's TORN CURTAIN, Hitchcock's TOPAZ is a more matter-of-fact tale than a genuine thriller where real lives were at stake. Essentially an American intelligence head (John Forsythe) uses his friend in the French Intelligence (Frederick Stafford) to spy for the United States in Cuba and at the same time they try to ferret out a high French official passing on secrets to the Soviets. This all takes place during the height of the Cuban missile crisis. Roscoe Lee Browne as Philippe Dubois has the best scenes in the film as he has to get close to the Cuban United Nations delegation visiting Harlem and staying at the Theresa Hotel to photograph some secret papers from a high official (John Vernon as Rico Parra). These scenes were what Hitchcock called pure cinema. TOPAZ contains an interesting score by Parisian Maurice Jarre.
0060955775|3.0|My favorite parts of the story were that of the other patients', namely Mari and Eduard. As for Veronika's own story, I didn't really relate and felt that her life was too perfect and the ending of her story too magical. <br />Though I wasn't inspired by Veronika herself, the story made me understand how short a human's life on earth really is. After reading the book I thought about what I wanted to do with the little time given to me on earth.  <br />\\"Veronika Decides to Die\\" is not really a profound read, but I have no complaints about it being boring. I will recommend this book to young people bored with their life -- I think after reading it they can be impacted like I was.   <br />This story hopes to tell everyone to treasure life. It is also a short read. For its important message, I'll give it three stars and overlook its other flaws.
B000003S0I|5.0|It seemed that King Crimson was over in 1972, when Robert Fripp decided to put together another band. He teamed up w/ outstanding drummer Bill Bruford, who had just left Yes, bassist John Wetton (who would later croon in Asia), violinist David Cross, and avant-garde percussionist Jamie Muir. Together this lineup would create 3 albums (though Muir left in 1973 after recording this album), and this one proves that they had an awesome chemistry.<BR><BR>It starts with Larks Tongue In Aspic Part One, a 13-minute avant-garde jam which turns out to be very scary after a while, with its percussion intro, those somber violin tones, Fripp's guitar sounding like it's coming straight from Hell and Bruford just wailing at the drums. Unbelievable! Leaves all those people who say &quot;tsk tsk, Bruford shouldnt've left Yes,&quot; feel rather stupid.<BR><BR>&quot;Book of Saturday,&quot; is probably the only low point on the album because it's a 3 minute pop song, with Wetton's sappy (at times) vocals, and sounded pretty radio friendly, before going into &quot;Exiles&quot; a song very reminiscent of their &quot;Court of the Crimson King&quot; days, almost a mixture of &quot;epitaph&quot; and &quot;court of the crimson king.&quot; &quot;Easy Money&quot; is a rockin jam, and &quot;The Talking Drum&quot; is a 7 minute jam based around a percussion line by Muir, ebfore it goes into the finale, Larks Tongues In Aspic part 2, ahard-rock jamfest, except not as eerie as part one. Still fabulous though.<BR><BR>Overall, Crimson made another masterpiece with this album, and this was arguably their strongest lineup. A must have for any prog-fan, or fan of very experimental music.
B00005Q79B|3.0|Star Trek had grown remarkably flaccid during its third season, the result of the production crew realizing that their diminished budget and weak new time slot had already all but spelled out the series' end.  The season had moments of rallying, putting forth some of the best scripts the show ever had  -  but the majority were pretty weak.  These two are of the latter category.<br />\\"The Cloud Minders\\" is a pretty piece of fluff with nice sets, costumes and matte shots, a reasonably good cast, and a terribly trite \\"socially progressive\\" script that is just a cheap retread of the classic silent sci-fi film, Metropolis:  the title characters are effete socialites, whose wealth is derived entirely from the exploitation of a permanent mining underclass.  Can Captain Kirk demonstrate to them the ethical folly of their ways, before the end of the hour?  (What do you think?)  The episode does have Jeff Corey, who is never less than stellar, and a generous helping of eye-candy in the form of Diana Ewing and Charlotte Polite, one of whom has an entirely unconvincing romantic subplot with Mr. Spock.<br />\\"The Lights of Zetar\\" fares little better, but is at least a serviceable semi-horror story, rather like a sci-fi version of The Exorcist.  Scotty's new love, Lieutenant Mira Romaine (Jan Shutan), becomes the target of a number of celestial space-lights that have already destroyed a planetary outpost.  The lights are the surviving personalities of the long-dead planet Zetar, seeking a host body in which to live.  Can the Enterprise find a way to exorcize the evil invading lights from poor Lieutenant Romaine, before the end of the hour?  (What do you think?)  Jan Shutan is pretty and genuinely likeable, but you have to pity poor James Doohan being saddled with yet another of Star Trek's third season absurd love-interest roles.<br />You could do worse than these two, but they're pretty unimpressive overall.
B0000691U1|5.0|A new 24 bit mix edition of the classic recording with two alternate takes never before released. I just program my CD player and play the album as it was originally intended, and it is amazing. Mingus and Roach are great, but dont expect long solos from these guys, they are backing up the Duke. He is in the spotlight, and I am grateful for that.
078322799X|5.0|I don't know why I'm bothering since there are already 70 revies of this film, but I'm just compelled to do this.  The Frighteners is probably the best horror movie ever made.  Most films in that genre rely on gore or sudden action to scare there audience, but Peter Jackson is having none of that.  This film builds its creepyness into a frenzy that you should not watch alone in the dark.<br />What makes this film so good at scaring you is the way Jackon's story weaves the ordinary life of Frank Banister (Fox) from a chance encounter with some truly evil people, into a vice-like grip where Banister must break free or be brought down himself.  And when I say that the villians in this film are evil, I don't me the typical horror movie \\"I'm a phychopath, so I kill people\\" evil, no Jackson gives them motivations that hit you where you live.<br />Without giving anything away, let me conclude by saying that this movie is a masterpiece of horror worthy of Hitchcock (OK, that may be going a bit far, but not much).  It has almost no gore (and what's there is mild) yet it delivers a spooky, chilling aptmosphere that will linger long after you swich off your set.  The perfomances by the actors are top knotch and Peter Jackson does a masterful job of blending drama and comidy while still delivering a deep and complex plot.<br />See it today, but don't see it alone.
B00006G8HX|4.0|OK, first of all, I'm not going to bore you with plot details because anybody who's a Trek fan has most probably seen it and know it.  Now then, here's where Star Trek III - Special Edition will have a special place in my heart for some time.<br />Back in the Christmas season of 1986, I got my first VCR along with 2 commericially recorded movies.  One of these movies was Star Trek III.  I requested it because I had missed it in the theaters and as Trek fans know, 1986 was the release year for Star Trek IV.  And since Star Trek II thru IV form what is commonly known by Trek fans as the \\"Genesis Trilogy\\", I had missed the middle movie, so I wanted to catch up.<br />Now then, fast forward to Christmas 2001.  I get my first DVD player.  One of the first movies I get is Star Trek: TMP - DE.  Now we have both Star Trek II - DE and Star Trek III - SE coming out relatively close together.  This year, 2002, has been a good year for Star Trek fans.  With the release of the full series of TNG and at least 2 of the movies in Special Editions.  And rumor has it that Star Trek IV - SE is already in production.  So if you're looking to buy the Trek films, hang tight and wait for the impending Special Edition versions.<br />I give the movie 4 stars because although it's a pretty entertaining movie, it's not one of the best Trek films.  However, the Special Edition version will probably bump that up to 5 stars with all the extras.
0140186409|5.0|I believe it is a mistake for schools to continue to assign their students the job of reading The Grapes of Wrath. This is a book written for mature, adults, and it is obvious from reading the numerous negative reviews left by teens that they are not mature, adult readers. How can anyone expect a teenager from today's hurry up, rush rush, society to enjoy a book that develops as slowly as The Grapes of Wrath. And how can anyone expect today's teenagers to enjoy anything that doesn't have crashing cars, explosions, graphic sex..etc. etc. about every 3 pages. Teachers would be doing all of the mature readers who can appreciate a book as great as this a favor by not forcing their students to read it, and thus sparing us from their immature, ridiculous reviews. No offense to teens, but most of them are not capable of understanding a work this deep.
B000069HKH|5.0|I am not the biggest Bruce Springsteen fan around, but i can tell you that his latest release 'The Rising\\" Is a can't miss grand-slam. I was skeptical at first with all the 9/11 overtones, but the songs prove to be mature and thought provoking and add to that his original E Street Band and what you have here is his best collection of songs since \\"Born In The USA\\". With fifteen tunes Bruce gives the listener a great cd with little if any filler. This cd blows away any of his late 80's or 90's releases and is destined in my opinion to sweep the grammy awards next year. Songs like \\"Lonesome Day\\", \\"Into The Fire\\", \\"Empty Sky\\", \\"My City Of Ruins\\" would make Dylan proud. All the non-acoustic tunes have that unmistakable E Street band sound compliments of Steven Van Zandt, Max Weinberg, Garry Tallent, Nils lofgren, Roy Bittan, Danny Federici, and of course big Clarence Clemons on sax and vocals. If your a fan of the old Springsteen, and appreciate well written songs and a tight sounding band by all means purchase this cd and enjoy.
B000002I25|4.0|I got this on casette for $1 at a garage sale and that night I decided to turn out all the lights, put on my lava lamp and crank this up.  It was absolutely wicked, I had never even really heard the doors before but right from the groovy opening bass lines on \\"Break on through\\" I was tranfixed.  The only diappoinment on here was the too-slow somewhat boring \\"Crystal Ship\\" but other than that its great.  Other highlights are the brilliant instrumental interlude on \\"Light My Fire\\" and the wonderfully drunken-sounding stuck-in-your-head-for-all eternity \\"Alabama Whiskey Bar\\".  This is psychedelic, woodstock-ish, strung-out music which you won't soon forget.  And you don't even need a bong to enjoy it.
0790733897|3.0|When people think of this movie, the car chases are pretty much the only thing they think of, but Steve McQueen is excellent as a weary detective, and of course, the young Jacqueline Bisset is nice to look at. Unfortunately, the hugely overrated car chase in Bullitt overpowers the rest of the movie. Regarding the car chase, 1) One of the three Mustang fastbacks Steve McQueen drove is a GTA (A for automatic), but he's shifting like crazy all through the movie and 2) A large part of the longest chase is simply the same intersection shot from different angles: McQueen goes airborne over a hill with the Bad Guys' black Charger in hot pursuit, and SF Bay is seen in the background, as a light blue VW crawls across the intersection McQueen is approaching. You may notice this same light blue Beetle crawling in front of McQueen at least 5 times in the next 5 minutes. Either drivers of light blue Beetles had a way of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or the film's editor needed to fill up a lot of time...I think it's the latter. Still, Bullitt is a good movie, and when I see it, it makes me still miss Steve McQueen. Since I reviewed this, I got the remastered Collectors Edition DVD, which includes a great bio documentary about McQueen. It forced me to remember how much I loved this flick when it first came out.
B000002KIE|5.0|I've had this record for 10 years and still listen to it because it is classic - timeless in every way.  Johnny Rotten was punk incarnate.  By California hardcore standards, this record may sound like plain old rock music (not noise and screaming).  <BR>If you don't have it get it!  Every song on it is good - a rock connoisseur's wet dream.
B00005QATY|5.0|This is probably the best movie ever, or at least since 1971 (see \\"Harold and Maude\\", the best movie ever ever). \\"O Brother\\" is a classic movie, more like the classic movies of old than any modern movie I have ever seen. Even my grandmother, with whom I always watch Depression-era movies and who claims to never understand a single modern movie, likes this film. <br />     I am in love with the soundtrack, and I think it is incredible the way it has caught on. I understand that it would be a huge success with us bluegrass enthusiasts, but my cousin, my Brittney Spears, N*SYNC listening cousin, owns this CD. Go figure! I guess people have finally begun to appreciate TRUE GREATNESS!!! <br />     One of my favorite aspects of this film is its similarity, as I have mentioned, to great old movies like \\"It Happened One Night.\\" George Clooney is so like Clark Gable in this film, it's almost eerie. Not to mention the fact that \\"O Brother\\" is set in 1934, the very year \\"It Happened...\\" came out. A coincidence? I think not!<br />     The long and short of it is, this movie is specTACular, and so is \\"It Happened One Night.\\" If you are considering purchasing \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\", do so now, and get \\"It Happened One Night\\" too. Save on shipping that way.<br />     P.S. The title of this review is my favorite line from this movie. Just recently my friend told me a story: He was half asleep, wandering through his kitchen, looking for rug cleaner and pretty annoyed, and he found himself muttering to himself, \\"I don't want FOP, ...! I'm a Dapper Dan man!\\" over and over. Needless to say, he burst out hysterically laughing. <br />     The End.
B000069HKH|4.0|If there is such a thing as an important album to own, this is it. Using the tragedies of 9/11 as the genesis of many of the tracks on The Rising, Bruce Springsteen has delivered a group of songs that often touch us, sometimes make us dance, and ultimately console.<br />Few, if any, artists could create a piece of work inspired by such horrendous events with such honest sincerity without a hint of exploitation. Bruce Springsteen, however, has done it. At first glance, the subject matter might suggest a dark record wallowed in sadness and loss. While those elements are here, there is an affirmative sense of love and faith's transcendence. Having used religious imagery often in past, Springsteen uses it even more and to great effect here. He yearns for guidance in My City of Ruins when he says, \\"I pray for the strength, Lord.\\" In essence, these songs are prayers. <br />The themes and sentiments alone do not make this a great album. Couple them with the music and arrangements, and The Rising is a special treat. With new producer Brendan O'Brien on board, the record has a fresh sound. Soozie Tyrell's violin is featured on many songs. And strings are used well on a number of songs, especially the resounding opener Lonesome Day. The return of the E Street Band is also part of why this record is so special. They seem to get better with age. Although a couple more Clarence Clemons' sax solos would have been welcome (see Nothing Man and Further On (Up the Road), the band sounds great. Max Weinberg and Garry Tallent remain rock's most unassuming yet powerful rhythm section. <br />At 52, Springsteen has made a record that is distinctly his but also fresh with new musical ideas. Besides the strings, he has guest Indian singers on Worlds Apart, a horn section on Mary's Place, and backing vocalists on Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin). The later, despite its tepid lyrics, is a wonderful soul song that some longtime fans might scratch their heads over. But the RnB beats and Clemons'slinky sax make this not only one of his most unique songs, but extremely radio-friendly. Mary's Place will please longtime fans who have yearned for a River-esque rave up. Somehow, inserted into the album's mix of sorrowful images, Waitin' on a Sunny Day appears and makes things seem whole and happy again. This is about as infectious as a song can get. It smiles with hope and has a wonderful arrangement. The ballads work as well, especially You're Missing. They are somehow both hushed and powerful. Further On (Up the Road) and The Fuse are powerful rockers, but don't initially grab you like, say, the recent Land of Hope and Dreams, which, with a new studio version, would have been a welcomed addition. <br />And while the lead single and title track - a tale of rescuers going up the twin towers - is the heart of the record, Into the Fire is its soul. The chorus somehow makes the grim images of the verses fade away - not into resignation but into reconciliation. \\"May your strength give us strength/Make you hope give us hope/May your faith give us faith/May your love give us love.\\" Again, the words are coupled with a haunting melody and a gospel like refrain - a lot like the record's closing My City of Ruins, which ends with the words \\"Rise up.\\" <br />Although he's fabulously wealthy, Springsteen remains an everyman. He's a dad and a husband; he's like us in many ways. He was touched, unnerved, saddened, and frightened by the events of last September just like the rest of us. He, however, has the rare ability to channel those emotions into art. Many of the tracks on The Rising hold up against the finer songs in the Springsteen canon. That's a bold statement. It's a focused effort with a rich sound, a wall of instrumentation that still lets trademark E Street flourishes like organ and piano seep through. <br />Metaphorically, The Rising's name may reference Christ's resurrection. And this may not be a stretch from an artist who grew up going to church and once released an album, Tunnel of Love, author and priest Andrew Greeley once called one of the most important Catholic events of 1987. The lives lost on 9/11 were not for naught. Their spirit remains, and in that spirit, Springsteen has crafted a topical but ultimately timeless record. Still, the record is more than homage; it is a musical experience, a rich, melodic, and powerful collection. <br />Indeed, Springsteen is on the rise again.
B000058983|5.0|&quot;Remastered&quot; albums are quite often a gimmick to soak fans of cash.  Usually they'll just boost the bass in the mix or adjust EQ levels, minor improvements that you can take care of with a decent stereo.  This is the most justified, and the most apparently necessary, remastered album I've ever heard.<br />If you own the original CD, ditch it and buy this.  There is an omnipresent low buzz on the 1990 CD, and losing that makes these songs sound new.  The guitars are more distinct, the vocal sharper, it's like the album has been wearing sunglasses, and when they're taken off you finally realize how bright the sun is.<br />If you don't own Forever Changes, buy this 2001 release immediately.  Tough to pick out a standout song, they're all classics.  Alone Again Or is one of my favorite opening songs of all time, right up there with I Wanna Be Adored.  The opening guitar line gives me shivers every time.  It's Bryan MacLean's finest moment.  The Daily Planet has a great riff, and the song changes so many times, goes in so many different directions.  The genius of Arthur Lee is at its fullest on this album.  Lyrically and structurally the guy was years ahead of his time.  There are light moments, dark moments, unbalanced moments, it's all covered.  I can't listen to a single song without anticipating the song that comes next...<br />...which is the greatest fault of the album, as the disc does not end with You Set the Scene.  The bonus tracks are great, but they should be on a 2nd CD.  Wonder People, I think, could have fit on the album just fine.  Your Mind and We is my favorite Love song, again, sounding much better than the &quot;remastered&quot; Love Story version.<br />Along with Pet Sounds, this is a CD from the 1960's that I consider indispensible.  OK maybe the Nico album too.  This album might take a few listens to appreciate?  Instrumentally there is some phenomenal stuff going on, not the least of which is Michael Stuart's drumming.  I wouldn't mind afew more Johnny Echols solos, but this is an acoustic album for the most part.<br />You might want to check out the Bryan MacLean solo albums, which contain acoustic songs, many of which were written around the time of Forever Changes.  Love was more than just Arthur Lee's band, and this is obvious as the quality of his work slipped when MacLean quit the band.
B00005B238|5.0|Perfecting the man-versus-beast genre, \\"Predator\\" tastefully combines suspense, action, and horror. It demands my highest praise.<BR>The plot is simplicity itself. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers lead six other heavily-armed commandoes through a Mexican jungle to rescue officials held hostage by guerrillas. Along the way, they discover the flayed bodies of former comrades who came before them hung upside down from tree branches. They blame and fight the guerrillas in an explosive ambush, oblivious to the real culprit--an unseen humanoid alien. On the prowl for dangerous game rather than easy prey, this solitary hunter stalks the team with stealth, speed, and strength. Heat-seeking vision, light-bending camouflage, blade-sheathing armor, laser-guided weaponry, and trophy-taking intellect all give it a lethal edge. The creature is visible as a transparent silhouette against the verdant panorama, revealing its true form only at journey's end. Outfought in almost every encounter, the commandoes one by one succumb to shots of superhot gas and stabs of serrate steel. Bleeding away men and gear alike, Schwarzenegger must lure his assailant into a trap if he hopes to survive his pursuit. The hunt spirals out of predatory control when the hunter appears and the hunted vanishes.<BR>I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a head-whirling, eye-popping, blood-spewing hike deep in the woods. Ultimately, \\"Predator\\" and \\"Predator 2\\" (a sorely underrated sequel) are less story-driven and are more character-defining than the \\"Terminator\\" and \\"Alien\\" series. \\"Predator\\" boasts surprisingly subtle special effects despite its age. We see much of it through alien eyes cast down from the forest canopy. Militant and ominous, the score (which is second to none) keeps up a brisk pace yet draws out the brutal grandeur of the unfolding tragedy. Tensions between Schwarzenegger and Weathers run believably high, and the gravity of their predicament comes across in deadly earnest.So turn around, scan the horizon, see the ripples in the foliage, and take your best aim, for a monster on safari has set its thermal sights on you!
B00004THAY|4.0|I've heard better from both Clapton and Kink.  It's a good CD, but not great
0064407667|1.0|We've been reading reviews and recommendations for months, so I went out and bought an edition of Lemony Snicket's book -- the 1st book in the series. I read it last night and I must say, I do NOT get the fanfare it is receiving. I  think its a horrid little book. The anti-'Harry Potter'... children at the whim (evil or stupid) of adult forces around them and they never prevail over their fate. It is Charles Dickens without things coming out alright in the end.<br />The children are left orphans in the first chapter when their parents die in a fire. They are sent to live with a distant cousin who emotionally and physically abuses them while trying to steal their fortune. The children outwit his scheme to gain access to their trust fund and have happiness in their grasp when they are invited to stay in a wonderful loving home, but the executor of their parent's estate forbids it because he doesn't think it would honor the wishes of their parents to the letter. So they are dragged off to await his poor judgement yet again.  And in between this all is a rather stilted writing style with caricature characters. <BR>This is going back to the store IMMEDIATELY!

Because some of the moive is cut out because there is not alot of tape for at all.<br />Well, the moive did't do so well  the with other view's. But not with me. I think it can do more better than that?? I think (George Lucas) can do better than that because I have seen some of his moives.<br />I mean it's a great moive and all but the fan's did't like it at all. So if you like it alright it not that's ok too. HEY! neverbody can't better good at all the time you know.<br />I hope you enjoy it and I like to hear form you soon. Ok. <BR>Thank you for reading this and please vote careful.
B00005KFUN|3.0|Remember Muse?  A couple years back, their first album \\"Showbiz\\" was all the rage, and everyone it seemed was either praising or condemning them for sounding too much like Radiohead.  The album itself was a mixed bag, with some very solid songs ('Sunburn', 'Fillip', 'Sober', 'Overdue') coupled with some that were appallingly dreadful ('Escape'), all delivered with a penchant for falsetto cooing by lead singer Matthew Bellamy.  Yeah, the lyrics weren't great (\\"Come in my...cave!\\" Huh?) but the skillfull songwriting generally made up for it.<br />Now, out of what seems like a rock opera gone horribly awry, comes Muse's second effort, \\"Origin of Symmetry\\", and let me just say at the start that grandiose doesn't even begin to describe the framework upon which this album's content is based.  Almost every song is big and overblown, with some reaching well past the 6 and even 7-minute markers, and tracks such as 'Citizen Erased' tend to suffer because of it, becoming a bit bloated with excess musical material.  That is not to say that the musical material is *bad* (because overall it is quite good) but there's just too much of it and very little connection between musical events within the same song.  <br />That said, it could be the single cohesive element within \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" (the rich, dense harmonic progressions) that makes it both unquestionably interesting and also a certifiable guilty pleasure.  This is definitely one of the most harmonically advanced albums outside of the classical/jazz sphere.  In a move that almost seems to give a nod to early 19th century classical music (especially Schubert) with a hint of the Baroque, Muse has constructed what are essentially Lieder with a backbeat.  Dominant sevenths (an unspoken 20th-century music no-no) abound, and while some of them (such as the progression leading to the chorus in \\"Plug In Baby\\") are intruiging and even surprising, most are very straightforward and bland in their resolution.  All of them, however,have a distinctly \\"old classical music\\" brand attached, and as a result, listening to \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" tends to produce the same sort of dirty feeling that one gets when listening to \\"Hooked on Classics\\".  You know that there's *something* wrong with what you're hearing, but it's hard to put your finger on just what it is.<br />As for the vocals, it seems as though the old Matthew Bellamy is back, only turned up a notch.  His trademark falsetto coo now seems to border on the bizarre (such as in the downright odd 'Space Dementia'), but fortunately he never seems to completely lose control.  His lyrics are again his weakest suit and the listener is confronted with 11 sets of writings that seem to demand a context but never get around to offering one up.  This includes the Leslie Bercusse/Anthony Newley tune 'Feeling Good', which seems to share Bellamy's fondness for loopy lyrics (\\"stars when you shine, you know how I feel/*scent of the pine* (...eh?), you know how I feel\\") but is given an absolutely brilliant performance on this disc.<br />What else can I say?  For every head-scratchingly bad track like 'Megalomania' there's always another that more than makes up for it with the sheer interesting-ness of it's content.  I look forward to Muse's next release and hope they continue to keep exploring the kinds of new (albeit odd) musical territory they have explored in the past.
B000005HNQ|4.0|I`ve just been reading through some of the other reviews<BR>and nobody mentioned this CD isn`t the place<BR>to start, MANDYLION or HOW TO MEASURE A PLANET are more consistant.<BR>NIGHT TIME BIRDS has its moments but it does have a few clunkers, and the long term interest isn`t as strong as Mandylion or HTMAP. I would rate Night Time Birds as the third<BR>Best, but still a must have CD for Gathering fans anybody into Floyd through to Lacuna Coil may also be interestd in checking it out.
6300181340|3.0|The Birds is a good movie. I like the part at the end when the birds are attacking Tippi Hedren. It was one of the best Alfred Hithcock movies ever made. <br />I watched this movie about 3 years ago and it literally scared me away from birds. I was so freaked out, I couldn't go near any birds for weeks.<br />The only complaint I have (and it may seem minor to some of you) but I think it looks a little out-dated. I mean, come on, who wears their hair in the same style as Tippi Hedren now a days?<br />All in all, a good movie.
B000002JR8|4.0|This album's pretty great.  Not quite as great as CFH or VDOP, which were much better overall, but this has enough standout tracks to make it worth buying.  The first 4 songs are outstanding, and worth the price of the album.  The riffs are absolutely killer, and instead of mindblowing solos, Darrell explores a little space and still shreds sometimes.  The cover of \\"Planet Caravan\\", too, is quite awesome.  Overall, this is a slight step down from their previous albums, but much better than anything that followed it.
0804115613|5.0|Comic, poignant, serious, and anything-but-serious-these words and many more describe \\"Fried Green Tomatoes at Whistle Stop Cafe\\". It all starts one day in 1986 when fed-up, fat, and 48-year-old Evelyn Couch is visiting her mother-in-law at an Alabama nursing home. Somehow, she meets Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode, whose 86 years have been filled with fried green tomatoes, priceless moments,  and the best barbecue in the world at Whistle Stop Cafe.<br />Mrs. Threadgoode begins to tell Evelyn a story-her story as well as the story of Idgie Threadgoode (Mrs. Cleo's sister-in-law) and her friend Ruth Jamison, who opened Whistle Stop's famous cafe and kept life in Whistle Stop anything but dull. There's Idgie's off-the-wall Dill Pickle Club, the town's chatty newspaper (the Weems Weekly), and that murder that never did get solved...<br />Fanny Flagg is an expert author. She has filled a book with the most memorable sort of characters, and each one is special. Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode was the sweetest old woman you'd ever want to meet, and Evelyn is laugh-out-loud funny in her quest for happiness. And as you read about it, you'll think you're really in Whistle Stop.<br />\\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" is truly wonderful, any way you slice it!
0071373586|3.0|This is very good beginning book.  However, if you're actually in the business world, trying to position your product, this book is not for you!  It's too broad and should look for a positioning book that is aligned with your industry.
B000069CWE|5.0|Wow... My favorite band actually pulled another all-hit CD... ..., the first CD I bought since Hybrid Theory, all the rest of the CDs out there are nuttin compared to this CD. I mean the CD case is awesome compared to those boring jewel case. This time in this CD it's enhanced and has 20 great songs. Juss buy the CD!!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|I am basing my review on the movie, so I hope the DVD will be added fun!<br />My husband is not always thrilled to sit through kids' movies.  We took my daughter, who was 6, and my son, who was 2.  We all loved the movie.  The graphics were great, the story was interesting and fun, and the music was fabulous.  The movie is not a 'babyish' movie, and it appeals to a wide age range.  Great family viewing!
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|Okay, its not really Titanic 2, but it more then likely resembles it. besides the fact that there both histoicly sound, there both love stories, there are 3 wars scenes, and only 1 good one! dont let that through you off! the good war scene is approximatly an hour long! it is a great replica of what happened. and it gets you hating Japs!!!!! which is great fun!, it could have been shorter, and maybe a little better casted. I could relate to the characters!, it is inncrediably accurate, thas why it deserevs 4 stars, A blockbuster at its best
B000067CPX|5.0|This entire CD is excellent.  In the past, I have only liked certain songs by the group, but this group really seems to have changed for the better.  They even tend to harmonize (kind of &quot;Beach Boy&quot; like) on a few songs.  Their songs are long as well as the entire CD, so you are getting plenty for your money.  Purchase this one, you won't be dissapointed.  As a matter of fact, you might be pleasantly surprized.  The choruses on a number of different songs really rock.  If you have never cared for the group before, give this CD a chance.
B000000OSG|5.0|This is arguably GNR's best album.  It is superior to the similar but simpler Use Your Illusion I.  Appetite for Destruction may be better than UYI II; it depends on the listener's preference.  Appetite is more radio friendly (although UYI II did spawn at least 4 hits) and is easier to get into because the songs are shorter, simpler, and all contain catchy riffs.  Still, I prefer UYI II.  It is an epic experiment that stretches the boundaries of hard rock.  I find it to be one of the most amazing albums ever.  On &quot;Civil War,&quot; a desperate plea against the horrors of war combines with an ultra-catchy chorus.  And for the last couple of minutes, the band changes the song's tone from dead-serious to funky-jazzy.  And somehow, it works!  &quot;14 Years&quot; is a diamond in the rough, written and sung by unheralded rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin.  The lyrics may be whiny, but the riffs will stick in your head for months.  &quot;Get in the Ring&quot; is a wild, raucous, sometime live-sounding challenge to all of GNR's critics, complete with Axl bad-mouthing his critics by name during an interlude.  But the tracks that really set this album apart from other GNR ones are the long ballads with multiple movements (thats right, MOVEMENTS!).  These are &quot;Breakdown,&quot; &quot;Locomotive,&quot; and the masterpiece &quot;Estranged&quot; which very well may be the most unjustly ignored song ever.  On &quot;Estranged,&quot; Axl's edge-of-sanity pouring-his-heart-out singing combine with Slash's killer wailing riffs.  &quot;Yesterdays,&quot; &quot;So Fine&quot; and &quot;Pretty Tied Up&quot; are all great tunes as well that you will find yourself singing along to after a couple listens.  <br />On top of all that, there are the 2 biggest &quot;hits&quot; of the album, 1 being the cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Knockin on Heaven's Door&quot; and the other being &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; which we all know from the movie Terminator.  Although I am a huge Bob Dylan fan, Iactually do prefer the GNR version by far.  Basically it just rocks a whole lot more with Axl's &quot;Hey-hey-hey-hey-yeah&quot; addition to the chorus, Slash's 2 guitar solos, and the gospel chorus near the end.  The last 2 tracks on the CD are just a pretty pointless alternate version of &quot;Don't Cry&quot; from UYI I and a 1-minute spoken psycho-rant by Axl set over primitive techno music, titled &quot;My World.&quot;<br />All in all, one of my proudest purchases ever; one excellent song after another from start to finish.
B0000075ZB|4.0|Dionne Warwick has come and gone, but has always remained a valued musical icon.  This Gibb produced set with Barry Gibb singing back-up was the 'breath of fresh air' Warwick needed.  Reportedly, she did not want to record &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, as she considered it not suitable for her voice.  It became a huge hit for her even if the album didn't have a great sales record.<br />The other single, &quot;Take The Short Way Home&quot;, is an awkward endeavor, seeming forced and lacking the 'funkiness' it deserved.  &quot;All The Love In The World&quot; is classic Warwick and the Gibbs seem to have a knack for pulling out the personality of singers they produce and write for.  &quot;You Are My Love&quot; is another example of this talent and is a great bouncy number that makes for nice finish.<br />&quot;Our Day Will Come&quot; is the only non-Gibb tune in this set and although it's rendered nicely, it seems out of place - almost like Dionne wanted one of her favorites on this album.  That's fine, but the credit truly goes to Barry Gibb and his siblings for such a remarkable production.  This is a great tribute to the talent of Dionne Warwick.
B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising is the first full length studio album that Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band have released in eighteen years.  The album is also the first by major artist to have the core of its songs directly address September 11th.  The songs take on the events from the views of firemen, widowers, a man who lost his life and terrorists.  \\"Lonesome Day\\" opens the album up and is somber in tone yet uplifting in melody.  \\"Into The Fire\\" is a brilliant song about a fireman going into the towers.  Mr. Springsteen prays that their hope gives us hope and their love gives us love.  \\"Waitin' On A Sunny Day\\" has a classic E Street sound with a rippling Clarence Clemons sax.  \\"Nothing Man\\" speaks from the point of view of a man who has lost his life.  It is a sobering look at the fragility of life.  \\"Empty Sky\\" details the NYC skyline minus the Twin Towers.  This might be the most personal song on the album as Mr. Springsteen himself drove to a bridge near his New Jersey and witnessed the destruction a day after the attacks.  \\"Let's Be Friends (Skin To Skin)\\" is a jaunty number that has a bouncy beat and reminds one of War's classic \\"Why Can't We Be Friends\\" in its call for understanding among different people.  \\"Further On (Up The Road)\\" is a buzz saw rocker that first appeared on his 1999-2000 World Tour.  \\"Mary's Place\\" is a nod to the E Street Band's halcyon days.  Going back to \\"Thunder Road\\", Mr. Springsteen calls all his friends to meet him at Mary's place in front of a Born To Run era musical background.  \\"Paradise\\" is a chilling acoustic base number that speaks from the point of view of a terrorist.  \\"My City Of Ruins\\" was first played at his Christmas shows in Asbury Park a couple of years ago.  The song was originally an ode to his adopted hometown, but it was transformed into a song about New York City after he opened up the America: A Tribute To Heroes concert.  Unlike that stark version of the song, the album version has a bright, uplifting gospel feel to.  The album's title track maybe the best song on the album.  Powerful, evocative and anthmatic, the song has all the classic qualities of a rock anthem for these times much as his \\"Born In The U.S.A.\\" was an anthem for the disillusioned of the baby boomer generation.  \\"The Fuse\\" is a solid rocker with a pulsating beat.  His only misstep is \\"Worlds Apart\\" which is about love between a white man and an Islamic woman.  The song combines middle-eastern music and mimics the sounds of Sting's \\"Desert Rose\\".  Mr. Springsteen employs producer Brendan O'Brien to helm the album and he updates the E Street sound beautifully.  He helps retain the band's power, while adding a shine and gloss that gives the music a new and fresh dimension.  He adds quite of bit a strings to the album, mostly in the form of fiddles.  The Rising reminds us of the terrible tragedy of September 11th, but is full of hope.  Mr. Springsteen shows that he still can get inside the skin of the common man and reveal his hopes, dreams, fears, losses and love of his country and fellow man.The album's title track maybe the best song on the album.

B00005KHEU|2.0|One listen to this album and it is apparent that Jeff Lynne and ELO were running out of steam by 1979. Not that the sales were disappointing. DISCOVERY has the distinction of being the only ELO album to spawn two TOP 10 singles, &quot;Shine a Little Love&quot; and &quot;Don't Bring Me Down.&quot; The first of these was a blatant attempt at garnering a diso hit before the fad faded and is saved only by a pretty cool bass line. The latter is the biggest hit ELO ever had...a solid rocker that would have been better with a little less polish, but still real good.<br />The other tracks are really uneven. &quot;Confusion&quot; (which almost sounds like a Roy Orbison song) comes close to being a good track, but the production makes it sound childish. &quot;Need Her Love&quot; and &quot;Wishin'&quot; come close, but kinda limp along. &quot;On the Run&quot; is forgettable. The less said about &quot;Horace Wimp,&quot; &quot;Midnight Blue,&quot; and &quot;Last Train to London,&quot; the better.<br />Altogether, DISCOVERY (along with 1980s XANADU soundtrack) marks the low point for ELO artistically.
B00005NZBN|5.0|There are no bad tracks here.  Every track is good, most of them great.  Truly a remarkable achievement for anyone, not to mention a 60-year old man who has been putting out music since he was 20.  Dylan is finally having fun again, unlike his brilliant but melancholy, bitter &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; from 4 years back.  Besides having great, ultra-catchy rhythms and riffs, the lyrics on this album are some of the best I have ever heard.  Often humorous, sometimes sweet, sometimes deep, Dylan is always giving us lines we remember, and love.  Especially on &quot;Love and Theft.&quot;  My personal favorties are &quot;Mississippi,&quot; &quot;Lonesome Day Blues,&quot; and &quot;Po' Boy.&quot;  <br />Here are some examples of the great lyrics I am talking about:<br />from Bye And Bye:<BR>&quot;Well 'm sittin' on my watch, so I can be on time...<BR>I'm singin' loves praises, with sugar coated rhyme&quot;<br />and<br />&quot;Well the future for me is already a thing of the past<BR>You were my first love and you will be my last&quot;<br />from Floater (Too Much to Ask):<br />&quot;Romeo, he said to Juliet, 'You got a poor complexion. <BR>It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch!'<BR>Juliet said back to Romeo, 'Why don't you just shove off<BR>If it bothers you so much.'&quot;<br />from Po' Boy:<br />&quot;Othello told Desdemona, 'I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.<BR>By the way, what happened to that poison wine?'<BR>She says, 'I gave it to you, you drank it.'&quot;<br />And there are many many more great lines on this album.
B000002UAO|5.0|&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is one of the greatest albums in rock, period.  One of the few albums where every song is excellent, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is also the point where the Beatles would begin their stratospheric climb to previously unexplored regions in Western Music.  Lennon and McCartney contribute some of their best songs, which have proven to have more lasting power than some of their more ambitious work.  &quot;Michelle,&quot; &quot;Drive My Car,&quot; &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; &quot;Girl,&quot; and &quot;In My Life&quot; have all become classics, still garneringing radioplay some thirty odd years after the album's release.  Though &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; gets acclaim for being the first great &quot;concept&quot; album, this is where the Beatles first began putting together songs thematically.  If you are a fan of pop or rock music, this album should definitely be in your collection.
B00005JKNC|4.0|I have read previous reviews of this film which prompts me to write a review of my own.<br />First off, The Majestic is not perfect. But, for what it is, it's pretty darn close. I do not believe this is a film about anything other than an attempt on the writer's part to let us know that we have choices in life. The choices we make in life determine the quality and value of our life. I do not believe the subplot about communism is meant to be a majorly serious attempt to address the issue of the Hollywood witch hunts of the 50's. It is a plot device to help the main character see how there is more to living a life than just wanting to be comfortable in the material aspects of life.<br />The look of this film is wonderful. It is like a grownup fairy tale world of what we would like life in a small town in the fifties to have been. The music is without peer. Isham did a fantastic job of allowing the music to evoke a mood.<br />Carrey is sincere and without goofiness in his acting. But, Martin Landau steals the show as his father. The dignity and emotional integrity he gives to the father is extremely touching.<br />Since 9-11, I have taken stock in how I have had a part in creating a world of ugliness because of selfish thinking. Well, to see that selfishness in its ultimate form of insanity as espoused by a so-called religion, I have stepped back from the \\"ways of the world\\" and I have made a choice of surrounding myself with the prettier aspects of life. The Majestic reaffirms the dignity and character of mankind without violence and sex. I think we need more movies like this to help us as a civilization get back on track. We don't need another Black Hawk Down with its violence or There's Something About Mary with its demeaning sexual humor. There are beautiful aspects of life if we look for them. The Majestic proves it.
B0000025DR|4.0|This is the nice \\"little\\" ELO record. The one nestled nicely between the lush, orchestral ELODORADO and the over-the-top NEW WORLD RECORD and OUT OF THE BLUE. It's the one that came out before THE LOGO, before the spaceship, before the merchandising. It's the one with \\"Evil Woman,\\" which is probably the most instantly infectious single the band ever released. It's the one with the almost laid-back production (by ELO standards, anyway).<br />It's also the one that features some of Jeff Lynne's best songwriting. \\"Fire on High\\" is a tremendous instrumental (almost a set piece) that opens the album. \\"Poker\\" is a wonderful pop-rock gem, while \\"Nightrider\\" is a pretty good example of progressive pop. \\"Waterfall\\" is a lovely ballad and \\"Strange Magic\\" is a spooky mood piece that became a second hit single. \\"Down Home Town\\" is a goofy stab at something that at least resembles bluegrass and \\"One Summer Dream\\" is a wonderfully melancholic album closer.<br />Over-all, a worthy follow-up to the majestic ELDORADO.
B0000683DH|5.0|The Wrath of Khan is, thus far, the single best movie viewing experience of my life.  It did everything right.  Since the characters were ones I (and everyone else) were familiar with it could get right into the story, no tedious introductions, even Savak fits in seemlessly to the overall story. <br />And the story is so clean, so basic.  Revenge, madmen, old sins coming back to haunt you.  It was a giant tale, with giant characters.  At twelve years old I was astounded.  The music was incredible, the interactions were incredible, and the special effects were phenomonal.  <br />It was a great movie going experience because I was still young and was niave enough to wonder, not how the good guys would escape, but IF they would escape.  And what a price they pay for their victory.  Radiation poisoning, Scotty keeping complete panic from overtaking the engineering section one minute before caving in himself the next.  Khan holding all the cards, only to have them slip away.  A federation captian gnawing at a communicator like an animal!  Enterprise cremmembers burning to death! <br />Wow.<br />Other movie experiences have come close.  The opening scene of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the big 'waking up' scene in THE MATRIX, the final gun battle in JOHNNY HANDSOME, but no movie has ever been as cool, consistant, and complete, start to finish, as WRATH OF KHAN.
0393317552|5.0|Bill Roberts is a white supremacist?  <br />Would have been tough for a civilization to exist one billion year ago Bill, seeing as how humans have been on the scene for the smallest of fractions of that time.  <br />Not to mention that the shape of the continents themselves was very different than what we have now.  Continental drift and all. <br />Diamond goes out of his way to present a theory in which race plays no role.  You are the one who injects race into his book where it is almost never mentioned.  Simply because he mentions that non-white societies have some positive aspects does not mean he &quot;loves non-whites.&quot;
B000002LQR|5.0|I've listening to this CD no less than 300 times.  Since I first heard their songs on the radio, to more than a decade later, Blood Sugar Sex Magik continues to impress me with its stunningly unique and gifted sound.  All great albums have a certain feel and theme that separates it from all other work.  BSSM is an impressively cohesive compilation, with all of its tracks forming a focused whole.  The vocals, drums, bass, and guitar all complement each other seamlessly and effortlessly.  The subtle yet immensely creative guitar playing is guaranteed to be like no other sound you've ever heard before.  Flea rocks it out as usual, and Anthony provides his most focused performance ever.  This album is a true classic, a certain masterpiece - nothing before or after will easily duplicate the magic contained in these 17 tracks.  I give this album my highest rating.
B0000025DV|4.0|Ah, OUT OF THE BLUE.....where do I even start. This was one of the first LPs I ever bought back in the day. Let's face it, this was ear-candy at its finest. A few too many empty calories, but still very fulfilling none-the-less (that is if you like ear-candy).<br />The best stuff here is just as good as the best stuff on earlier (and more consistent) ELO records. &quot;Turn to Stone&quot; is immaculate, &quot;Sweet Talkin' Woman&quot; is fun, &quot;Night in the City&quot; captures its subject so well. The Concerto for a Rainy Day section is very nicely done, indeed (especially the melancholic &quot;Big Wheels&quot;). <br />But, alas, there is a fair amount of filler. This probably could have been avoided had Jeff Lynne decided not to release this as a 2-record set. I've always found &quot;Starlight&quot; particularly annoying and songs like &quot;Sweet is the Night&quot; and &quot;Across the Border&quot; make it seem that Lynne was scraping the bottom of the barrel. Then there are instances where the production becomes intrusive. &quot;Birmingham Blues&quot; is actually one of the better songs on the album, but the performance is too stiff, too calculated.<br />Still, this CD has at least one good album's worth of material on it and it is easily worth 12 bucks....that is, if you're into really well-crafted pop music.

B00003CXMG|4.0|Roll back the 70s: a teenaged reporter who writes reviews for  underground rock-mag Creem gets a sudden break when he's employed by big-league-mag Rolling Stone to go on the road with up and coming Stillwater and deliver a report on them. <BR>   During a wild 3 weeks on the road he (and we) sees the inside of rock n' roll of that era. All the elements are there. The 70's looks and attires, the drugs, the music (original songs written among others by P.Frampton and Cameron Crowe), the teeny \\"rebellions\\", the inner band strifes,the groupies and the developing rock industry, the then societal pulse, and the overall atmosphere set by the film's main characters, most notably the teen-reporter, star-groupie Penny Lane and of course the band members and last but not least the boy's \\"crypto-conservative\\" desperately-trying-to-be-progressive mother.<BR>    \\"Almost famous\\" is a brilliant film. Before you can even begin to care whether what the film depicts is accurate, you find yourself laughing endlessly, and being \\"sucked-in\\" by a story that at times has semi-documentary touches (makes sense, as the story is a semi-biographical account of Cameron Crowe's) and loving the main characters (all charismatic in their own sense).<BR>   The film's main \\"weapon\\" is its superb humor. I dont merely mean one-liners but the overall feeling it has, you dont only laugh but this movie tends to have a feel-good sense all over it as well. It's supposed to, right? After all, this is the 70s when everything still had a \\"purpose\\" or when things seemed to be more upbeat (compare with the prozac ridden 90s and their \\"nowhere to go from here\\" sentiment).<BR>   All the actors do a terrific job to make the time machine work here. The mother is great in portaying a representative of the mothers generation that first perceived music as an \\"enemy\\" and as a gateway to drugs and (oh my god) wild sex. The band members are going from cool to uncool all the time (as real band members very often do) as theytry to act like rock stars (\\"make us look cool, man\\") and at the same time try to maintain their human nature (...). The teeny reporter (in my opinion the least convincing of the lot) is decent too while the show is stolen by the enigmatic and pivotal character of groupie Penny Lane. She's is the one character that the others actually revolve around like satellites whether they realise it or not and also serves as a solid reminder of that period as well ( or maybe, not only of that period, in fact, why is rock music being mostly made if not to be \\"cool and get chicks\\")..<BR>    The dialogue is great, the directing is great, the actors do a great job. Anything missing from Almost Famous to keep it from being a classic?? I would think not, but: because of the way this film works and of its very nature ppl will tend to see it as somewhat of a documentary. Is it? Tough question that one.<BR>   The rock era of the 70s wasnt a monodimensional one. It wasn't only about bands that were Led Zepellin lookalikes and people who  were constantly professing \\"it's all happening man\\", and above all things were not always that lighthearted. In fact, a lot of people back then thought that there was a musical revolution going on which was going to -in turn- bring about an overall change of things. Ask anyone who's over 45 whether the music of that era did bring about a revolution and get prepared for some really long discussions with very differing conclusions.    Inotherwords, there were very many people around back then who took the whole thing very VERY seriously. Perhaps that is -epidermically- depicted by the rock critic in the film. <BR>    It would be unfair though to criticize the film on that premise. After all you cant expect a film to fit in all that in 2 hours. And even if it somehow had done that it could've very easily been boring albeit more accurate.<BR>   The fact of the matter is that \\"Almost Famous\\" is a wonderful film in very many respects. It goes from hilariouslyfunny to touching with its dripping nostalgia. And yes it does have this \\"things were better and purer back then\\" feeling to it, but in the end the way people perceive the times they live in depend on very many different factors.<BR>    I've seen this movie twice already and loved it both times and i hardly see how anyone could not love it actually no matter what other thoughts are to be had on the side.<BR>    Almost famous is almost perfect
B0000025DT|5.0|ELDORADO is probably the best ELO record, but A NEW WORLD RECORD still stands as the DEFINITIVE ELO record. It was released just as the band approached super-stardom and became a multi-platinum smash. The production is superb. It is also chock-full of pop gems. <br />There are, of course, the hit singles. &quot;Livin' Thing&quot; and &quot;Telephone Line&quot; would both hog the airways well into 1977 while &quot;Do Ya&quot; and &quot;Rockaria&quot; reminded fans that Jeff Lynne still liked guitar-heavy mixes, at least sometimes. But even once we get past the hits, the quality is still high. Let's face it, &quot;Tightrope&quot; is probably the best track on the album, and &quot;So Fine&quot; would have probably surfaced as a hit single if it had been released on any other ELO record. &quot;Above the Clouds&quot; has almost a PET SOUNDS type vibe, while &quot;Shangri-la&quot; is another great moody closing track (with a big choral ending - you gotta love that!). &quot;Mission&quot; is another great progressive pop piece despite the preachy lyrics. <br />If you were going to buy 1 ELO record (not including a best-of collection) this is the one to buy.
B00005ABX0|5.0|If you want to know more about the music within the cd, look at the other reviews. Sorry, but I'm just going to focus on sound quality here.<br />Mark Linett is the man who engineers all of the Beach Boys cds. He's always done a pretty good job, but, in my opinion, the first cd of Pet Sounds was not very good - he used so much noise reduction that the whole thing came out sounding terribly flat. <br />Well, the good news is that Linett has become a master at this stuff. The new reissues sound fantastic, and are encoded for HDCD, which means that, while they still sound good on a regular player, if you have a cd player that is HDCD compatable, you will thrill to a SUPERB sound, a very lush and warm high end that has been missing up until now. <br />In the case of these albums, that means that you get to hear the chaos that was Brain's home studio, with all the little extra noises that got in the way of making otherwise superb recordings. People breathing, things being dropped - they are all there! And the vocals - my gosh, they sound like the singers are right there! <br />Let's face it - these two albums are not sonic masterpieces by any stretch of the imagination, but they are presented here in their best-possible sound, and it is worth getting!
B000069HKH|4.0|I wasn't sure of what to expect from this CD, given that I had read that Bruce would be dealing a lot with 9/11.  What he has done on &quot;The Rising&quot; is nothing short of astounding lyrically.  He doesn't specifically mention anything about that tragic date for our country, but rather the ramifications that the tragedy had on individuals and the nation.  Powerful songs like &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, and &quot;You're Missing&quot; are touching, heartfelt snapshots into what the victims must be feeling.  Other songs like &quot;Mary's Place&quot; and the title track provide a sense of hope that we will be OK.  With the exception of Bob Dylan, I can't think of another songwriter who could capture the emotions of that tragic September day than Bruce Springsteen.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this CD 5 stars is that the music does not show much development, given the amount of time between the last recording with the E Street Band.  Perhaps, though, Bruce wanted to have a familiar sound to go with his words to provide some comfort and a sense of consistency.  The E Street Band plays extremely well, but they aren't given enough to do.  A few more solos from the other members would have made this more of a group project and maybe more of a sense of community. This is a CD that will touch you emotionally, plus remembering why you bought albums in the first place.  Great job and thanks for the effort, Bruce and the E Street Band!
B000069CWE|1.0|How can you top Hybrid Theory?  The songs are great, the music new and innovative, and the vocalalists are the best around!  Reanimation was disappointing at best.  It left me with one buring question -- can I get my money back?
0312952813|5.0|The Black Ice has been the fifth book of M.Connelly that I have read. So far, it is his best! The story is gripping, exciting, elaborate, suspensful, and absolutely well thought out.<BR>The tensness is increasing permanently till the end with a finish that is quite surprising. In particular, I liked the way Connelly describes the character of Harry Bosch. You really 'learn' something about him and get some insights into his complex and 'different' personality. <BR>If you like crime novels/police stories than this is for you! Although Connelly's way of writing is different from J.Ellroy or R.Chandler, his novels are absolutely comparable. <BR>My recommendation is, buy the book 'The Harry Bosch Mysteries' where you've got the first three H.Bosch novels in a chronological order (The Black Echo, The Black Ice, The Concrete Blonde). Although it is not essential it is better to start at the beginning due to the fact that some 'small stories' are much easier to understand. <BR>I will continue to read the other books of M.Connelly because he is a great author in a time where you find loads of rubbish in the book shelves. BUY IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B00005JKNF|1.0|This movie, without a doubt, is the worst movie I have ever seen.  Anyone who enjoys movies, even terrible ones, will NOT want to see this movie.  This is a complete waste of time & I was mad at myself that I sat through this movie for nearly 2 1/2 hours.  All this movie was about was Englishmen & women sitting around talking, eating...Servants sitting around, working, talking and eating...the rich talking down to the servants...by the time the murder happened you will not care & even more so this is the most boring murder mystery ever...again all the detective did was talk to people who wouldnt talk to him.<BR>Trust me people, this movie ...
6305736650|5.0|I didn't think that Bogie could top himself after the Maltese Falcon, but then he and Ingrid Bergman had the love affair of...well, all time in Casablanca.  This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever.  Surpassed in style, technique, and vision only by Citizen Kane.  This is a good love story, one that even men will enjoy.  What sets this apart from all the cheesy Hollywood romantic comedy chick flick hoopla is that in the end, they don't live happily ever after.  A superb movie.  Bogie and Bergman were at the top of their games, as was the whole supporting cast.  Go see this movie NOW if you haven't already.
1884737994|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It is explained simple enough that even a novice can understand, and learn, how to do everything from adjusting rim brakes, to adjusting bearings everywhere, and even bleeding hydralic brakes, if that is your cup of tea.<br />It is in depth enough that if you already have some experience repairing bikes, that it can give you some pointers you may never have thought or heard of.
B00005JL3A|4.0|The Good:<BR>1) Good looking sets.  Because of budget constraints they filmed many scenes on/in existing locations.  This worked in their favor.<BR>2) Fairly fast paced.  You are put in a bad situation that just keeps getting worse.<BR>3) The movie is actually 3 stars but I gave an extra star just for the director/cast voice over commentary option on the DVD.  Watch it once without it then switch it on and watch it again. Very, very funny.<br />The Bad:<BR>1) They didn't go far enough.  The movie has much less gore than you would have thought a movie like this would have.  The director said that any more and they might have gotten an NC-17 rating but I suspect they didn't have the money to do any more since I have seen many other movies that were more graphic that still got the R rating.<BR>2) Don't go into this thinking its a \\"Zombie\\" movie or that its particularly scary.  Its not.  Yes it has Zombies in it but its still not that type of movie.  Its more of an action/sci-fi movie.<br />The Ugly:<br />All in all just switch off your brain and enjoy.  Don't try to put it in the same league as an Oscar contender.  Just relax and watch.  Not everything has to be A Beautiful Mind.
B0000509C4|5.0|I own Creepshow 1&amp;2 on vhs but it is the same film so I write my view upon that.Creepshow 2 is one of the best films I have ever seen when you see it for the first time it is very scary.After you have seen it more than once which I garantee you will want to it isnt so scary.I wont give to much away but the film comprises three horror tales based on short stories by legends of<BR>horror Stephen King and George A Romero. It took a long time for me to add this little gem to my collection and I would never part with it if you have the film Im sure you&quot;ll agree.If you have not got it all I can say is BUY BUY BUY!!.
B00005RYKU|5.0|The Glass house starts Leelee Sobieski, Diane Lane, And Stellan Skarsgard. This movie is about Ruby (leelee) eho parents die is a car crash. Her and her brother Rhett, movie with the Glasses. Terry (Stellan) and Diane seen to be the perfect married couple. But when Ruby finds secretes shes not supposed to, she sees who realy her new guradians are. She suspects that they killed her parents and is trying to escape. But it doesent work because Ruby has no liscense, and she is caught by Terry. This movie is rated PG-13 for Sinister Thematic elemets, Language, Violence, And drug content. On my scale from 0-10, The glass house is a Tense, Twisting, Scary 9. Have fun and be careful who you trust!
0871137380|5.0|I strongly recommend that anyone interested in strategy, military tactics as well as military history pick up this book. The author, Mark Bowden does a great job of not glorifying war, just making you feel and dwell on the gravity of what happened. The book leaves you with so much to think about. Many times while I was reading it, I just had to put it down and think about what I had just read because I was so blown away. Although obviously written from the American perspective, it clearly shows how complicated things can get in such a situation and how quickly things can escalate out of control.  I feel more than anything that this book accomplishes what it set out to do, tell a story that needed to be told as truthfully as it could be, (the book was written based on many interviews conducted by the author with the soldiers involved and some Somalis.) It tells the story showing and at times attempting to explain what went wrong, all the while giving some insight into the politics of the situation, many times leaving me in disbelief.<BR>The only glorifying it does is it shows that when people are thrust into an impossible situation, how they come together, (or at least try) and do what must be done to survive. The loyalty they display in not leaving anyone behind and attempting to rescue those fallen is highly commendable.  Having said this I feel that I need to add in that Black Hawk Down is hardly complete, but it is a good attempt at telling this story and we owe that to all the people who were there and those who lost their lives. <BR>-Kosta M.
B00005RYLE|5.0|Hands down the greastest low budget gore film ever! The film has a huge reputation and lives up to it every bit. And this book of the dead DVD is the ultimate collector's must have! Don't think so? Well, middle finger to you. You're missing out. (geez, its a joke!) Honestly, though. Make an effort. What do you have to loose, besides a hour and half? Better spent on this than the dreck we know as Hollywood.
B000069HKH|2.0|The sheer mediocrity of this album is astounding. First, Springsteen has completely lost the ability to sing. Gone are the fullness and vibrancy that once marked Springsteen's vocals. We are left instead with a sort of talk-singing that is compounded by a grating nasal affectation. Second, the music simply does not deliver. The album has a noodling, mid-tempo sameness that is only occasionally lifted (Further On, The Rising). The E Street Band might as well be the session players from Human Touch and Lucky Town. Third, while the album packs some degree of lyrical force, the media hype that has surrounded the lyrical content, which Springsteen seems to be feeding, borders on the exploitative. As a fan, I had held out hope . . . but I am sorely disappointed.
B00005JL3A|5.0|OK. I know that Resident Evil had barely any gore. And people are saying that it should have had more. But I think becasue of thr lack of gore it made it better. I know I sound nuts. But I like horroe movies with out over doing the gore. Resident Evil is about a team od paramiltary commandos must battle flesh-eating undead, killer dogs, and a supercomputers deadly defenses before an unleashed virus cunsumes humanity. I think this movie is a good adaptation of the video game series. It has action, violence, language, brief nudity, and some blood. I heard a rumor that the director had to cut some scenes from the movie becuase they contained so mmuch gore, that the movie would have gotten a NC-17 rating. I had also heard that there was going to be a directors cut, but I bought the movie the 2nd day it came out and i did hear of any directors cut. Maybe it will come out in the future. I know there is going to be sequel to the movie coming out in 2003. I look forward to seeing it. On my scale from 0-10 Resident Evil is a Action packed, Screaming good time 8. I reccomend it for anyone who has played thr game!
B00006950W|5.0|I heard this movie was bad, but when I saw it it kicked ***.<BR>I havent seen a gorrier movie yet. The action was awesome,the special effects where great. I reccomend this movie to any horror fans, or gut fans.
B00005JKNF|1.0|When I watch a movie, I expect to be entertained. Gosford Park did not give me any bit of entertainment whatsoever. The scenery and setting was quite beautiful, and I would say that the acting was good, except that there was no story to act to. This so called \\"whodunit\\" mystery was hardly a whodunit mystery at all. The extremly thin plot doesn't suggest much motive for any of the characters to commit the murder. And when the mystery is solved, the ending is hardly suprising at all. I will not spoil the ending for anybody who has not yet seen the movie, but I will say one thing - I would've expected the murderer to be someone who had at least a decent amount of screentime. To me, they basically introduced the characters that were involved in the murder for the first time when they reveal the mystery. To make things even worse, the main character seems indifferent when she discovers the whodunit mystery.<br />I truly do not understand how this movie got nominated for Best Picture by the Academy. I guess it got nominated for the artistic qualities of the movie. If you want to watch a truly artistic movie, watch either The Lord of the Rings or A Beautiful Mind. Gosford Park is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
B0000640VO|5.0|What a great movie! The main reason why it's great: it focusses on the details of life. The joy of skipping stones. All the other little things that make life worth while. It's a great fairy tale about the way in which you can manipulate your life in a subtle way. It's a shame to tell you more, except that we are talking about a feel-very-good-movie. <BR>It's a bit warmer then Delicatessen or The City of Lost Children.
B00003CY0V|5.0|I truly can understand other reviewers negative comments about this film.  Unfortunately, the film industry has been putting out heaps of [stuff] like \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" and \\"XXX\\".  However, unlike those movies, Swordfish isn't a [poor] teen flick that makes you feel retarded after watching it.  I mean, this film has some definitely interesting ideas about dealing with terrorism.  Ironically, made before 9/11, Swordfish involves a black ops agent who acquires the help of a hacker who's down on his luck.  Mayhem soon follows as Hugh Jackman's character realizes the kind of mess he's gotten himself into.  I gave this film 5 stars because I actually apprecieted the fact that the characters were comprised of thirty something actors.  These days, Hollywood tries too freaking much to appeal to teenagers by having films featuring meat heads like Vin Disel.  Plus, in a wierd way, this movie stands out for me since there's sort of no real qoute on qoute \\"bad guy\\" in this film.  The director of Swordfish also did the incredibly awful \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\".  However, he definitely makes up for it with this movie.  Take the time to watch Swordfish, for an action flick, it definitely has some interesting views about such important topics like global terrorism, which is something that's lacking in today's films.
0790730960|5.0|Batman Returns certainly delivers. Everyone in this movie did a good job just like in the first Batman. Tim Burton really knows how to keep the dark nature of Batman alive. Also, I thought that Danny Elfman did as good of a job with the Batman Returns theme song as he did with the first film theme song.
B000065U1N|5.0|I look for movies that work on several levels at once.  The ones that do make it onto my shelf.  \\"Black Hawk Down\\" has a spot.  I first saw it in a theater with a colleague who saw combat in Korea.  At several points, I heard his sobs alongside my own.  BHD is, one one level, a cracking good war story.  Anyone interested in military hardware or tactics will be satisfied.  It's a story about human evil and the degradation it causes:  \\"This food is the property of Mohammed Farah Aidid!\\" cries a militiaman at a Red Cross station while his countrymen fall down faint with hunger.  BHD is about the power of one accidental event to throw already questionable plans askew.  Not even sure they have the right building, Rangers rappel from hovering helicopters to arrest Aidid's cabinet at a building in the marketplace of Mogadishu, Somalia, some of the most dangerous real estate on the planet, even today.  One man falls, his friends stop to assist him, and it's all downhill from there.  A militiaman scores a hit on the tail of a helicopter, and things get worse.  The word that changes the mission from arrest to rescue goes out:  \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"  The film is about courage and loyalty, and the ability of those virtues to bring men out of terrible danger.  Though several characters are composites, Sergeant Eversman, a fellow Iowan, is real and believable.  In his first stint as the leader of a \\"chalk\\" (a small combat unit), Eversman does his job and does it well.  Though the story is set against the backdrop of global politics (and particularly the politics of Clinton's first term), the film dwells no more on this than on any other area.  Everything works, and works well.  I hereby forgive young Josh Hartnett for appearing in the wretched \\"Pearl Harbor\\" (and what was Ben Affleck thinking?).  Someone said once that war is at root an experience of shared suffering.  Ridley Scott made me feel the suffering of everyone in Mogadishu that day.  Including the starving man who wordlessly carries the body of a child across a street as bullets fly.  BHD is not anti-war.  It's not pro-war.  It's war.  Each generation needs to count the cost, though none do.  More's the pity.
B00005B36H|5.0|I was an offbeat fan of Tool before Lateralus, but after purchasing this wonderful album, I can honestly say they are one of the finest current bands around. They have quickly moved into my favorite bands list, although mostly because they are a changed band. The &quot;old&quot; Tool (Opiate to Aenima) was a moderately stimulating group that had exceptional talent and even more potential. However, they have now broadened into a much higher form of conceptual art. And as an industrial fan partial to &quot;Stinkfist&quot; after all these years, you can be sure that if I love this new style, you'll love it even more.<br />Layered songs that keep you analyzing are key to the success of this album, yet not so much to keep the public away. (I'm a huge Skinny Puppy fan, so vague song meanings are not a new deal for me. -_-) Although, somehow, this album will most likely not be a big hit with TRL people. Well, Tool's genius and captivating videos are assurance of that. Definitely not MTV fare, so Britney fans need not apply.<br />A superb lyrical performance by Maynard, a beautiful drum track on every song, thoughtful guitar and bass tracks, and a series of provoking vocal manipulations (ala...every band I listen to: NIN, Manson, Puppy, ;Wumpscut...everyone) will keep those willing to listen pleased. My personal favorite song on this exquisite album is a toss-up between the title track &quot;Lateralus&quot; (hands-down, the best single in YEARS) and &quot;The Patient&quot; (overlooked masterpiece).<br />Not overly complex, yet highly stimulating. As Ogre once said in the hauntingly deep Curcible, &quot;not all is so black-and-white.&quot; Truer words could not be applied to Lateralus. Add that to the fact that you'll probably be tapping these babies' beats out on every flat surface you come across, and you've got yourself a winner. Hasn't left my CD player since I brought it home.
078322799X|4.0|Overlooked thriller from Peter Jackson, and I believe, MJ Fox's last movie.  This movie is definitely worth renting if not buying.  Original, unpredictable story line, a bit convoluted here and there, but it never lets you down.  The CGI effects are kinda dated as of this writing, but the comedic acting is right on target.<br /><br />Though the film has elements of Beetlejuice, Ghost, The 6th Sense, and Ghostbusters, it's still original in its own right.  It may take you a little time to appreciate the director's vision, but when you do you'll have a good time.<br /><br />...
0790731002|5.0|I liked the different approach to Batman Forever, even if it wasn't as dark as the first two. True, it would have been just as good if not better if Tim Burton did this movie and Michael Keaton had of stuck with the roll. Still, Val Kilmer did a good job as Batman, Tommy Lee Jones pulled off Two Face, and Jim Carrey made the Riddler shine.  And of course, it's good that Robin was included in this movie. Out of all the Batman films, I prefered Chase Meridian as Bruce Wayne's girlfriend but that's just my opinion. Anyway, Batman Forever makes three in a row for the successful Batman series.
0761536434|5.0|All I have to say after reading this book is, WOW! Steven Kent has done a remarkable job compiling and telling the facts about the strange and delightfully twisted history of the video game industry. Throughout the book, he effectively transports you through time and brings you into the board rooms, behind closed doors, and into the private conversations of top industry executives and designers all over the world. By diving into just about every aspect of the video game industry, he chronicles its growing pains with an eye for detail that will simply amaze you. If you ever wanted to be a fly on the wall in the back rooms of Atari, Nintendo, and Sega (to name just a few companies he dissects) then this is the book for you. I can only say that I hope Steven is deep into writing his next installment.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is the best remix album of the year.This is a cd that you can listen to all the way through with out skipping a song. It's Hybrid Theory remixed with more of a hip hop sound. If you like rap, Hybrid Theory, or you're just a linkin park fanatic, then purchase this cd.
0671646788|3.0|This has helpful advice, but it's kind of naive at times. To overcome shyness, \\"shake a person's hand and smile and you'll banish shyness.\\" I overcame shyness, but it took a lot more than that!! Also the money amounts should be updated. If you follow his advice you can be in the group that earns \\"$15,000 annually.\\" Wow, I'll be rich! Woohoo!<br />But, nonetheless, a lot of good is in this book.
6305095442|5.0|Sam Raimi had a much bigger buget for this remake/sequal and it shows. The special effects are stylish and original, Raimi really shines through in this movie. The making of the film on this DVD shows Raimi's comic side. He even done a scene based on a \\"Three Stooges\\" gag. This film zooms in more on the character \\"Ash\\" (Bruce Campbell). Bruce Campbell's comic side is shown also in this movie, with a massive character delvelopment from \\"The Evil Dead\\", he is more witty than ever with those immortal one-liners and over active expressions. Almost everything you see in this movie some how always tracks back to the original. The one that really sticks out is the cabin also the clock, tape recorder and many more the list could go on.<br />This movie seems much more enjoyable than the first as the atmosphere is very different also the \\"action\\" starts straight away. A good move by Raimi. The whole trilogy is a cult classic wrapped in a big bow. Raimi's ideas and scope can be seen in each movie. And it moves away from being your average piece of shlock.
B000069HK2|5.0|The CD is incredible... absolutely amazing.  Probably the best CD I've bought in the last few years.  That has been well covered in the other reviews, I want to get ot the real strength of the band... their live shows.<br />I'd heard a couple of songs by the Used that I really liked, however when I was waiting for them to take the stage at the Warped Tour I didn't expect them to be as impressive as other acts, such as Thursday, that I saw earlier in the day.  But I was wrong.  They came out and immediately kicked the crowd's ass, which was relatively small compared to the bigger named bands that were there.  But it didn't take long to see there was something special going on.  Bert was belting out his signature sound, and on the taste of ink, everyone who'd heard their stuff joined in.  <br />The band worked the crowd perfectly, allowing moments for us to sing on our own, and dialogues between songs.  The feeling was much different from the other bands though.  Instead of crazy moshing, the focus was intense on the music.  Leading up to them finishing with \\"A Box Full of Sharp Objects\\" where Bert's throat tearing intensity was matched by everyone in the crowd, which had been steadily growing throughout their performance.  This modest sized group of people generated a louder sing-along than even the biggest groups at the concert.  <br />In my mind, The Used may be the greatest live band out there today.  I look forward to getting to see them in their own concert playing a full set.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is the best remix album of the year. Its a cd that you can listen to from begging to end without skipping a song. It's Hybrid Theory remixed with more of a hip hop sound to it. If you like rap, Hybrid Theory, or are just a Linkin Park fanatic buy this album.
B00005JLDW|1.0|Although hyped and attractive through the trailers, this film falls completely flat. The most wonderful aspect of this film is the brief display of the dragons' prowess to destroy and the one initial sequence of a dragon capture and kill. Other than these aspects, there isn't any redeeming value to this film. The films begins with the uncovering of the sleeping dragon, then morphs to the post-apocalyptic period with the human race barely surviving in a dragon dominated planet. The script has so many hole in the design, it is very surprising that the script was not mistaken for swiss cheese. So many questions left unanawered ...Why have the dragons so dominated the planet? When the planets population became so devastated, how did the dragons continued to survive?..on and on. This film rightfully earned the right to receive Howie worst rating of one star.

B000069CWE|4.0|Before you buy this you need to think about it.  I bought it the first day it came out and i was lucky enough not to be disappionted.  Fact is, and there's no way around it, this cd has an entirely different sound than Hybrid theory.  If their DJ Mr. Hahn and eemcee Mike Shinoda had written Hybrid theory this might be how it would have sounded.  If you love LP and are expecting another dose of the Hybrid theory, then be prepared for something else entirely.  Some of the best DJs and Eemcees have gotten a hold of LP's music and it has changed completely.  I think that is a great cd, nearly as good as Hybrid theory, but very different.  Picture longer songs and more electronic music.  Some of the lyrics have changed and the guest artists on every song contribute their own styling and lyrics.  As far as remixs go these are some of the greatest i've ever heard.  Twenty tracks and an hour long you'll have plenty to listen to and it is worth the money.  So consider it carefully, it's great music but it isn't like that last LP album
0316776963|2.0|Maybe, being a 60 plus, I simply do not understand Sedaris' humor, but this book is the biggest disappointment I have read in a long time. Moderately entertaining, perhaps, but funny, no! If you want laugh-out-loud funny, read any of the Stephanie Plum mysteries by Janet Evanovich; or Edward Abbey's \\"Monkey Wrench Gang\\" or anything by Dana Stabenow, funniest being \\"Breakup\\"; or anything by Carl Hiassen or Dave Barry. Mark Twain is funny and smart. Sedaris is pathetic.
0380820846|2.0|To sum up, this book was a disappointment.  I am a huge fan of Quinn, in particular the Bridgertons, and I have been counting the days till the release of \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton.\\" Needless to say, this book did not live up to my expectations.  It started off great but towards the middle the only thing that saved me from eternal boredom was Lady Danbury and her sharp wit.  This book lacks the romance we have come to cherish in the rest of Quinn's novels.<BR> The majority of the book deals with Colin and Penelope's insecurities rather than the love they supposedly find for one another.  Colin reminds me of a whiny teenager, complaining because he has no purpose in life, rather than the witty character he portrays in the rest of the Bridgerton series.  Their courtship played only a minor part in the book whereas unveiling Lady Whistledown and helping Mr. \\"Insecure\\" Colin were the main topics.   <BR> In addition, this book also lacks description, we are never really given the opportunity to understand Colin and Penelope's feelings.  It's as if we are reading in the third person and observing tidbits from the outside.  Overall, I would have to say that this book had great potential and didn't follow through.  I hold out hope for Eloise though.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Anyone on here who has anything bad to say about this album has lost it! I would most definately check it out if I were you.  I can listen to it over and over without needing to skip a song because they are all that good.  Very relaxing, happy, and somewhat 'peppy' music in a way.  YOU MUST CHECK IT OUT!  It's my favorite CD I own right now!!
B0000634EV|5.0|When Phil Anselmo (Vocals) and Rex Brown (Bass) from Pantera, Pepper Keenan (Guitar) from C.O.C, Kirk Windstein (Guitar) from Crowbar and Jimmy Bower (Drums) from EYEHATEGOD come together, they form the sludge rock supergroup, Down. Influenced by the likes of Black Sabbath, Down plays thick, sludgey, powerful music. The album was far beyond what i expected. It sounds like Black Sabbath, EYEHATEGOD, C.O.C, and some steroids all mixed in a blender. I highly recomend this CD for any fan of Black Sabbath, C.O.C, or EYEHATEGOD
B00005ATZT|5.0|I found this movie absolutely fantastic. It was a well crafted picture, and is an instant great, thusly my short review on this movie. I do have one thing I did not like is the constant flash backs, but otherwise its totally chipper.
B000069CWE|2.0|i love LP .. this is the reason why i bought Reanimation on it's release date<br />BUT .. LP steps onto their hip/hop side to leave alternative fans hungry .. composed of mainly rap and throbbing beats .. there is no longer beauty in their tunes .. admist all the remix and cameos by outside artists .. LP lost their true identity which is disappointing.
0385720920|5.0|This is the finest work of literature that has ever been published. It is a funny, profound novel. <BR>Victor Mancini, a medical school drop-out, is the funniest pestimest/sex-addict I have ever read a book about. And the only to this state. His mother is crazy. Ever since he was a kid (a stupid, nail-biting boy) she had been that way. Now she has amnesia, so he decided to choke on food so the 'HERO' who saves him will feel more commited and prideful to him.<BR>And so they can enrich Victor with valuable checks to show they still are his hero.(?) And that's how he pays for his mother's care.<BR>As his colonial flash-back-to-1776 district gives him some money for his employment, his best frend decides to collect rocks and live with Victor. Victor is in a society of craze and he is supporting it himself. In between all this he still has time to research his life to see if he is actually the second-coming of Christ, and have great fulfilling sex.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is such a cool album by Madonna. The Material Girl is back. My favorite songs are her major hits \\"Ray of Light\\" and the amazing \\"Frozen.\\" This album is co-written and produced by Madonna. She does a pretty good job in these fields. The album in itself also has nice techno beats. Way to go Madonna!
6305320802|5.0|Out of all the DVD's that i own, this is my all time favorite. Everthing is perfect!  The picture quality is awsome, the 5.1 channel stereo sound is better than most theatres. The overture, the intermission, the entra'ce, the exit music,,,,all there from the Roadshow presentation.Of course for some reason my favorite character is Aunt Eller (Charlotte Greenwood) I've always loved her. She's always been one of those great supporting actresses that is so awsome in structor to whatever movie/stage show she was ever in.  Great talent and great talent to everyone in this movie version.  I believe a remake would be impossible in todays world and the newest Broadway version has comfirmed that. It just lacks soul. Sometimes you should just leave the classics alone. Don't try to improve on them because you can't and in this film you could never muster up a cast like this one. It's a perfect movie musical.
B000003TA4|5.0|This CD is great. It puts me in a trance whenever i listen to it. I could just sit on my bed for hours thinking \\" ...
B000069CWE|5.0|This cd is the best Remix CD BAR NONE! It barely qualifies as a remix cd as most of the songs have been comepletely redone both musically and lyrics. It's more of a reinterpritation of the themes of Hybrid Theory than remixes. Anyone who is a real Linkin Park fan will Love this cd.
1884737994|4.0|Whether you have a shiny new mountain bike or one that has been on more than a few trail rides, this book is a must to have in your collection.  For about [price] and the price of some tools you'll be able to perform the most common maintenance on your bike yourself.  Not only will this save you money (tuneups aren't exactly cheap these days), but you'll understand your equipment much better and be able to handle unexpected situations on the trail.<br />The book is a large format with two columns of text per page and hand drawn figures (basically no photos).  Each part of the bike is covered in great depth in pseudo-outline form.<br />The only downside is that the figures can be a bit difficult to understand.  I can see how they can be more clear that photos, but some combination of the two or perhaps just more figures would have helped.  I've found it is always best to look at the figures alongside my bike so there is no ambiguity.
B000069HKH|5.0|Wow!  Just got this today and spent the whole day digesting the music.  Definitely among Bruce's best; I'll have to listen for a while to figure out exactly where it ranks.  For today, tied for second place with TUNNEL OF LOVE after BORN TO RUN sounds right.<BR>    I'm I diehard fan and admittedly biased, so readers of this review should keep that in mind.  Springsteen's passion for writing about everyday people rising above adversity makes him the definitive musician to help us explore our reactions to 9/11.  He accepted this burden and produced a truly great and powerful work.<BR>    Traditional anthems like &quot;The Rising&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; are comparable to fist-in-the-air sing-along-with-the-Boss songs from BORN TO RUN, the full of energy &quot;Mary's Place&quot; reminds me of &quot;Rosalita&quot;, and darker but still inspirational pieces like &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; brings to mind songs of endurance and faith from TUNNEL OF LOVE.  The CD has a couple of relatively weak songs - the sappy &quot;Let's be Friends&quot; does nothing for me - but even that one plays a lighhearted role in a CD of such overall seriousness.  What most impressed me were several songs where Bruce branched out in some new directions:  the hard-edged rocker &quot;Further on (Up the Road) was in more current style than what the E-Street Band has done before; and the true stand-out among all these great songs was &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; - an intriguing fusion of Middle-Eastern melodies and U2-like rock.<BR>   Get this CD - it's an instant classic for rock purists, and it contains messages of faith and endurance that all of us can benefit from this year.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I will start by saying that I gave this 2 stars for the production value. I have a tendency to agree with the reviewer that said he could feel nothing for an android. Because outside  the realm of compassion is reality. And realistically speaking, who cares about someone who never was or will be human. It's just a machine that is confused. I found almost all of his \\"Mommy Mommy\\" banter to be really annoying. She never was his mom to begin with. Just another store bought product. If he was meant to be human he would been born that way. Not created in a labratory. I think for the most part that sums up the whole approach to this godforsaken [film] Steven Spielberg calls a movie. Heavy handed & boring. I could go on forever about the horrible psychology behind this [poor movie]. But why bother?
B00005S6K8|5.0|When i was but 14 years old, i knew nothing about classic movies and actors. I didn't know why i loved Audrie so much and how could bogat be so stiff when kissing this imortal girl.<BR>All i knew was that when i first saw this movie, i was touched.<BR>I was moved by the sweetness, by that girlishness, and by that thing that made that wonderfull story so authentic even by today's standards.<br />Sabrina's story - in this latest producsion- didn't loose much of its old charm.<BR>The actors - if not Hepborn & Bogart -than at list the wonderful<BR>Ormond & Ford. <BR>With all my admiration for the late Bogy, i still think that ford has done a much better job on the older brother,<BR>and Ormond came quit close to our beloved Audrey, so close that she has in-fact captured that certain magic.<BR>The story is still the same though,: A girl falls in love with her idole, girl lives home, girl comes back -refined-, idole makes a pass at her- not recognizing her-, and so on to the plonder with the older brother and ofcourse the inevitable HAPPY-END.<BR>Gotta love it, even- and aspecially- today.<BR>\\"5 thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\"
B000069HKH|4.0|Let me tell you first how I like Bruce Springsteen: I love Bruce when he rocks! I love songs like `Two Hearts', `All or Nothing at all' or `No Surrender'. So I did not quit know what to expect from `Springsteen 2002'. The last thing I have heard was his dark and sentimental contribution to the `Concert for Heroes' called `My City in Ruins'. And I did notice right away, that this song was now on his new album, occupying the last slot, number 15. Would this be the mood of the entire CD?<BR>I needn't have to worry. The opening track immediately lets you know, that Bruce is back - and he came back to rock! Not in a way like he rips through songs like `You can look but you better not touch' but he rocks in the perfect mid-tempo Springsteen style. And best of all, Springsteen has been listening to the radio! He gave his sound a refreshing face-lift. Nothing too drastic, but he updated his sound enough to make this album definitely sound 21st century-ish by adding creative drum breaks and arrangements here and there.<BR>Well let me about the songs then.<BR>1. Lonesome Day starts with a dramatic string intro, and then evolves in a nice rock song along the `Human Touch' lines.<BR>2. Into The Fire opens with a nice slide guitar and a beat box in the background. A nice mid tempo song with lots of acoustic guitars.<BR>3. Waitin' On A Sunny Day starts like a classic Springsteen rocker, but instead of some electric guitar, it is kept acoustic again with some nice fiddle arrangements. `Everything will be ok - Don't worry we're gonna find a way' proves the positive vibe of this whole album.<BR>4. Nothing Man is the first quiet song on the album, along the lines of `My Hometown'. A really beautiful song.<BR>5. Countin' On A Miracle starts with a quiet acoustic intro before the drums kick in and the song evolves into another mid-tempo rocker.<BR>6. Empty Sky - another song that starts with a drum machine before the real drums kick in. Again, lots of acoustic guitars.<BR>7. Worlds Apart is the first real highlight of the album. Picture Springsteen doing Sting's `Desert Rose'. But two minutes into the track the song explodes with the first dose of electric guitar. Very powerful! Just great!<BR>8. Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin) - again, a drum machine intro. But this time not much happens. Lots of organs, a bit of acoustic guitars, not my favorite.<BR> 9. Further On (Up The Road) is my absolute favorite: This is Springsteen at his best. A fantastic driving beat, a splendid melody that you can't get out of your head, and an arrangement that leaves no room for improvement. The only real rocker on this album with lots of electric guitars. I catch myself repeating this track over and over again while driving to work and back.<BR>10. The Fuse - hey - another drum machine. But then there's an un-Brucie beat and the song evolves into a nice melodic mid tempo rock song with some electric guitars.<BR>11. Mary's Place starts with strings and a mandolin. Again, the song picks up after about a minute - another classic Springsteen rock song - could have been on `Born to Run' or `Darkness on the Edge of Town'.<BR>12. You're Missing - another nice, slow track. After a quiet piano intro this song evolves along the line of classic early eighties Springsteen.<BR>13. The Rising goes back to the `Human Touch' area. The drums kick in after about one minute and we have another nice Springsteen rocker.<BR>14. Paradise is the only song that could have turned out a bit `too bruucie'. But even this tender ballad (the only really slow song on the album) is delivered and arranged beautifully.<BR>15. My City Of Ruins - There it is, `My City in Ruins' - but this time, almost one year after the devastating September 11, Springsteen delivers this song in a beautiful, positive manner, looking forward to better days to come with its gospel choir in the background. That's exactly what we need: A positive attitude from one of America's greatest songwriter and observer of current affairs.<BR>It is very tempting to say, this is one of Springsteen's best album! In my opinion, it is right up there with `The River' and `Born in the USA'.
B00005S8FC|5.0|A release with heart, soul, guts and seething passion. The use of accordions with beats and tango is novel and instantly grabs your attention. A powerful and enjoyable release, not to be missed.<br />When I play tracks from it on the radio I always get calls from listeners wanting to know what it is.
0140149295|5.0|I couldn't put the book down (Hense the reason I didn't need a book mark). This book is easy to read and it was exciting and suspenseful. It starts off in the beginning, when he was a child. No one can remember vivid detail of their younger life (I'm talking kindergarden). The way Rubin wrote this book was like he remebered everything. The description of the racism and corruption in the police force back then just made me scream! It angered me on how much the prosecution lied to frame Rubin. <BR>    You'll love this book like no other! <BR>       Rubin Carter's style and attitude he put into this book was great! It is as if he had written other great books previously.<br />       IF YOU WERE INTERESTED ENOUGH TO READ A COUPLE OF REVIEWS (INCLUDING MINE) THEN YOU WILL DEFIANATLY LOVE THIS BOOK!<br /> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S OUT OF PRINT! <br />THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!!
B00000269M|4.0|No doubt about it. Michael Jackson is the greates Pop Star of the decade and his fame n charm would never wane. Thriller had been a great success with MJ's rare 80's album featuring great songs like Thriller, Billie Jean, Beat it and Girl is mine. Bad came out of the blue, a newer style of Michael Jackson's singing and &quot;Bad&quot; turned out to be the *Best Pick* among all his albums. Though I luv to listen to Blood on the Dance floor, Earth song, Invincible, Black or white and many more, Songs of MJ's 'Bad' are all A +. Michael Jackson created waves with his videos and Bad itself is a great video n a song 'Whose Bad?' is # one UK &amp; US and a concern voice. Liberian Girl is my fav song. The way you make me feel is a sweet song and I just can't stop loving you is a great romantic song - could be a valentine pick. Just good friends alongwith Stevie's vocals, together makes it grand and rare talent exposure of the duo. The way you make me feel, speed demon, Smooth criminals are all equally good songs. Quincy jones &amp; Michael Jackson has some real good Album 'Bad' for fans and created waves. History had some great numbers too and Invincible too but apart from all 'Bad' is my fav album which I possess. Sure, MJ is the King of the Pop next to George Michael, my fav too.
B0000696I1|4.0|Personally I myself am a film buff, and this movie cinimatically has its faults, but at its heart it goes back to the roots of the TV show which i watched as a child, The first 2 movies were  dark, They had better writing and puppetry but were so grim. this disconnected it from the younger generation of turtle lovers.<BR>it is not the best in the series but it is my favorite, it has more fantasy and charm than the first 2

B000069HKH|5.0|This is a GREAT record. Not good, GREAT. But after 30 years, what else would one expect from Bruce? A singular talent that shines through on this record.
B000002HMH|3.0|First off, Metallica was one of the first bands that got me listenting to rock and roll, and I thank them for that. i have listened to everyone of their albums, from Reload, the Black album to the legendary Master Of Puppets(their best and the second best rock album of the 80's next to Guns N Roses Appetite for Destruction). Load isn't nearly as impressive as the 80's Metallica, but it [not bad] either. Until It Sleeps, King Nothing and 2X4 are some of the highlights on the album, but there is definite filler on the album. Overall a solid performance.
B00000HYXB|5.0|There are several stylistic affectations that the casual music listener will have to accept to appreciate this album.  Presumably, though, if you are looking at this hear you are already familiar with all the usual Progressive and Metal tropes (bellowed and shrieked vocals, panzer-brigade guitars, etc).  This album is really spectacular stuff.  If you like big bombastic music, this is some of the best ever made.  I don't care what anyone says, Hansi's vocals are a cut above all of the other &quot;clean&quot; metal vocalists out there, and several above the gutteral mumbling that passes for modern rock vocals these days.  In terms of content, this album is no lightweight either.  They follow the Silmarillion admirably.  I am still confused as to who the narrator of several songs are supposed to be though.  I assume Ungoliant is speaking on Into The Storm, but assuming that the chorus doesn't make sense.  Thorn, as best I can tell, is about Maeglin, but it is too vague to be certain.  The songs follow the story well until they skip from The Kinslaying (Noldor Dead Winter Reigns) to the Dagor Bragollach (Time Stands Still) which is a pretyy big part of the story to cut out.  And also does anyone know why it ends with Morgoth's seeming victory in the Fifth War, when the book ends with the coming of the Valar and Morgoth's fall?  But these are minor quibbles.  If you like this kinda prog metal, this stuff is the best there is.
B00004WIBW|5.0|did not think this would be my type of movie...boy was i wrong. excellent directing by the ever creepy tim burton.  johnny depp is magnificent as is christina ricci.  christopher walken makes the perfect headless horseman......great great great movie an absolute must see.  especially for those who are expecting it to be just another movie about ichabod crane and the headless horseman like i was....you will be pleasantly surprised.
B00005UQ9F|2.0|This movie seems to me to be another case of a director filming the first draft of his script rather than taking the time to construct a good story.  The script is a jumble of creepy ideas, creepy scenes, creepy sounds, all thrown together but never successfully TIED together.<br />Anderson himself says in one of the special features that he came up with the story because of the location.  It shows.  He started with an eerie place and tried to force a story into it, rather than starting with interesting people and putting them into a situation they had to deal with.<br />One of many examples of what's wrong with this movie--what's with the chair at the end of the hall?  It's the main visual image in the poster, it is shown repeatedly during the movie, leading one to think that the climactic moment and the key to the richly-layered mystery one hopes one is being caught up in involves this chair, in this room, and guess what?<br />The chair doesn't mean a thing.  Nothing.  Anderson just thought it looked spooky.  And that pretty well sums up the whole film.<br />The ending is a lame attempt at tying together all the disconnected images that come before, and it fails completely.  It's a shame, too, because Anderson's superbly atmospheric direction and the wonderful performances (they're all wonderful) are very enticing.<br />But it's a fake.  Anderson really has no story to tell.  He just couldn't wait to shoot and edit some footage.
B00000255F|5.0|Wow, you start the CD off with Thunder Road an emotional roller coaster of a song.  This CD contains brilliant lyrics that goes right along with the amazing music.  The great song if I had to pick one is Junge Land.  This 9 minutes epic contains amazing lyrics and also includes a saxaphone solo from The Big Man.  Then there is the title track that is so powerful and uplifting.  If you are a true rock and roll fan, or a Bruce Springsteen fan you must pick this up.  Enjoy this CD and see how Bruce saved rock and roll back in 1975.
B000065U1N|5.0|The characters in &quot;Black Hawk Down,&quot; remain fairly anonymous. The film isn't about the participants of the battle, but the cold, fierce battle itself. It is told from the point of view of the collective American soldier--although omnipresently--who only wishes to do his duty.<br />The soldiers are comprised of typical people next to whom the average person may live. There's the idealist, the class clown who would impersonate everyone for laughs, and the hotshot who everyone wanted to emulate. He was brave, dashing, and resistant to authority. <br />It is important to note that the only reason that it appears this way is because it was this way. Battles aren't fought by glittery or gruff characters such as Mel Gibson, John Wayne, or Tom Hanks. They are fought by our friends and neighbors. Some are boastful, others humble, but always someone we can approach and trust if need be. This is what makes the relative anonymity of the actors in &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; one of its most redeeming traits.<br />The action sequences are hard to beat, since it doesn't waste much time with character development. The movie portrayed different forms of the enemy--the calculating strategist and the vengeful savages. One need only look up the footage of the way the Somalis paraded the dead troopers to know part of the portrayal was accurate, and the makers of the movie should not be raked over the coals for being honest in this regard.<br />One team leader from &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, a D-boy whose courage and experience helps preserve the lives of many of the men on that mission in Mogadishu, offers a bit of advice to the recently promoted leader of Chalk four. &quot;Once the first bullet flies past your head, all that politics flies right out the window.&quot; Just so. However, the movie manages to magnificently straddle the fence of mildly condemning either the political mission or those who initiated it, while vindicating those who were charged with fulfilling it.We would do well to learn the lesson this movie teaches, that we need not condemn the military to protest a &quot;rightly-fought&quot; war. Likewise, nor must a protest of the war be construed as an assault on those who were ordered to conduct it.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|There is no question as to why Fiona Apple is a sucess; we have craved the voices of pain-stricken, angsty women since Nico lended her melancholy vocals to the Velvet Underground. Fiona's first album &quot;Tidal&quot; was a debut with the elements of hurt and anger that are, as history has proven, typically lost in an artist's second attempt. Yet, Fiona has not been cursed with the notorious sophmore slump. With lyrics like &quot;No matter what I try you beat me with your bitter lies, so call me crazy, hold me down, make me cry, get off now baby It won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hand&quot; (Limp) &quot;When the pawn...&quot; proves to be more enraged than it's proceedor. This album is all around more mature and structured. It is built apon blues vocals and strong melodies. The lyrics are better eloquated and the chords have a smoother, less choppy sound than in previous work. &quot;When the pawn...&quot; is beautifully done and sets high expectations for Fiona Apple in the future.
B000069HKH|5.0|There they are, Bruce and his old E Street Buddies - sounding strong and vital. The sound is a little different than on the old cd's - but doing the same over and over again would be no fun. The songs are for the most part heart-wrenching, yet hopeful and defiant. It's like a secular mass in a way, the repeated choruses like on The Rising and Into The Fire conjure faith and hope, fist-pumping resistance to death and madness. There's also Mary's Place, a nice party song in the vain of the classic Sherry Darling. As someone having seen Bruce and owning every CD I am very impressed by this rebirth of Bruce and his E-Streeters.
B000069HKH|5.0|Other than a greatest hits album, this is the first Bruce Springstten album that I've purchased.  I think as I've gotten older I've grown to appreciate a musician like Bruce.  He never stops working at his craft and is he's not afraid to bare his soul in his music.  This is a great album.  I think because of all the references to emotions and feelings of what he and everyone else were and are feeling after 9/11 make this probably the best record I've heard this year.  It's not often that you can buy an album today that is filled with good songs from start to finish.  Kudos to you Bruce.  You've gained a new fan and a convert from NJ!
B000000H48|5.0|If you're reading this review as a person curious about King Diamond, please, start here.  BUY THIS DISC for it is a masterpiece.  <br />I use to mock KD, just because of his opera voice and gothic insanity, but then I listened.  And I was blown away.  The guitars on this disc are simply amazing.  The tempo changes, the moods, the solos and even the intricate rythms are second to few.<br />&quot;At the Graves&quot; is loaded with changes, &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot; could have been written by Randy Rhodes, &quot;A Visit From The Dead&quot; is hauntingly beautiful and brutal in the same 5 minutes, &quot;Amon Belongs to Them&quot; is wonderful and &quot;Victimized&quot; has more great changes, wonderful drum work, and also my favorite guitar solos after Sleepless Nights.<br />KD is a strange dude.  But don't let his looks/image/beliefs deter you from this disc.  If you like metal, this should be in your collection.

B00005JKG7|4.0|\\"The Fog\\" is one of those films that gets creepier with every showing. The plot is a classic ghost story of unrelenting suspense. Antonio Bay is a seaside coast that harbors a deadly past. Centuries earlier, a leopard colony wanted to settle in Antoinio Bay to make a new lives for themselves. A group of people decide to double-cross the group by forcing the ship they were on to crash into the bay and sink with all hands on board. Now the crew have returned from their watery graves to seek gruesome vengeance on the their ancestors. Carpenter's flare for atmosphere goes well and the creepiness is very effective. I recommend \\"The Fog\\" to anyone who loves a good ghost story.<br />Note: \\"The Fog\\" is coming soon in a \\"Special Edition\\" with these features                                                             <BR>    1.

B000069CWE|4.0|This cd is cool. Most of the songs were just turned into rap versions. &quot;Crawling&quot; is definitely different from their original version, but I like the violin's solos. All in all, I think the cd really comes together as a rare and excellent album. I would recommend this album to everyone that's a Linkin Park fan.

068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes teaches its readers so much about life and being human. This book is so down to earth and real. I love it because there are so many messages woven throughout the book and it makes you want to laugh and cry and be angry and so many other things all at once. You become a part of McCourt's life, or so it seems, and his extraordinary telling of it took me on a journey of amusement and sorrow and wonder. Everyone would enjoy this book.
B000002J6H|5.0|Great album one of the best of the early 1970s, but there's still a lot of material left in the vaults, accoring to Dave Zimmer's book on CSN, Stephen Stills cut a lot of material with Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix which remains unreleased to this day during the sessions which took place in London. (Yes, for anyone who didn't know, Stephen Stills lived in England in the early 1970s which explains for the inclusion of Andy Johns engineering and Ringo Starr appearing on two tracks). So maybe this great album should either be expanded or the best of his unreleased work become available on a seperate CD or maybe double CD.<br />Great album, go out and buy it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Wow... the reviews for this film certainly do swing from one extreem to another.  Fight Club came out during my freshman year in college, and i never planned on seeing it, untill a Girl that i know, told me i had to see it.  I figured it was because of Brad Pit that she enjoyed it so much.  I walked out of the theatre in what you could call a state of shock.  This movie took me places that I never thought possible. It was more twisted than my own personal daydreams...  this movie rocked.  So when it came out on DVD, i bought it immeadiatly, and must have watched it 20-30 times in a row.  Now, i know im not the brightest person out there, but im not slow either... I learned, watched or understood something new every time i watched it. and i still do.  I would call this movie my anthem, the anthem for a 19 year old boy, who has just moved out into the world for himself, and trying to define himself.  In a world of possessions, i think i learned the most valuable lesson that can be taught, from a movie called Fight Club.  happines is not your clothes, toys, cars or amount of zeros in your bank account, happiness comes from your life, and what you make of it.  Watch the movie, think about it, and Watch it again.  it will make you think.
B000000I0D|3.0|The best are QE2 and Five Miles Out.<BR>The introducing instrumental, the main compositon is so weak that I could'nt rate this CD more than a three.<BR>The pop songs are okay, but Taurus 3 is not that good.<BR>Just simply compare the title song to Taurus 2 on Five Miles Out. That one is far better I think.<BR>May be you'll like it. I did not.
B0000683DH|5.0|The Wrath of khan is definetly one of the best Star Trek movies to date.  Bringing back Khan and adding several different movie themes was a great idea.  The space battle at the end is marvalous not a Star Wars knock off of any kind.  The story and action all together make this a great Star Trek movie.
B00005QZWJ|3.0|Sadly, a predictably lush score that only serves to distract in context. Shore's work has typically hit subtler emotional notes than this; ponying up to treacly convention undercuts the epic momentum required for this film. A suprisingly weak point in an accomplished film.
B0000020C4|5.0|I've been reading these reviews, as well as other Les Miserables reviews, and have noticed the big hoo-haa surrounding the issue: Who is the best Eponine?  Here is my opinion- they all are, in different ways (and in different songs).<br />Frances Ruffelle- cute voice which sometimes borders on whiny.  She captures the youthful resigned-ness of Eponine very well.  Her contributions in the Love Montage (In My Life, A Heart Full of Love) are the best.<br />Kaho Shimada- despite the accent, she does an admirable job in portraying the playfulness and tragedy of the character.  Her 'On My Own' is the best one I've heard, in my opinion.<br />Lea Salonga- excellent voice, perhaps a little too perfect.  In her Eponine, she captures the her bitterness, strength, and wisdom.  Her 'Little Fall of Rain' brings me to tears almost every time. <br />Another side issue: I've noticed a few rave reviews of the Aussies Philip Quast and Anthony Warlow.  If you'd like to hear them together, there is another recording you may be interested in.  It is the Australian recording of the Secret Garden, with Warlow playing the main guy, and Quast playing his slightly evil brother (sorry, the names of the characters escape me).  Their rendition of 'Lily's Eyes' is stirring.
B000069HKH|3.0|On first listen it comes across as mostly a pop/folk collection, some tracks reminiscent of earlier Bruce, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Phil Spector.  The anger, angst, and personal redemption/liberation themes are gone, but we shouldn't expect (or wish) those to stick around into middle age.  What's left is Bruce as sage, counselor, cheerleader, and the songs consequently don't cut as deep or inspire in the old way.  Nonetheless, the fact that he's trying to transition is both palpable and worthy of admiration, and of course we listen because it's Bruce.
0312954468|5.0|I loved this book.  On July 24 'bamahony' commented \\"Many reviewers seem to forgive Taita's utter perfection and endless accomplishments and talents - this eunuch single-handedly invented, saved, or otherwise was responsible for every single aspect of Egyptian history and art that has survived the ages. How anyone could claim realism with this character is beyond me...\\"  This is what truly made me feel a sense of realism: many writers of ancient history enlarged their own parts in events.  I found Taita to be intelligent and creative, but a braggart.  This story is Taita's tribute to himself and those he loves.  I doubt that anyone would have accomplished all these things, but I believe that someone would CLAIM to have done so.  Smith's writing was beautiful and majestic.  The scenery was fantastic, and I was choked up at the death scenes towards the end.  I can't wait to read Warlock September!
B000002JST|5.0|AC/DC. The name screams electric power. That's exactly what this band is. This is their heavy classic from '77. AC/DC is a metal band that takes the blues metal of Zeppelin and turns it up to 15. Sabbath couldn't match this band for sheer volume. This is a classic record from one of the top 5 classic metal bands in history.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I purchase quite a number of CDs thru ... based on the recommendation feature.  It's probably my favorite ... feature, and it has introduced me to a broad assortment of great music.<br />I've been familiar with Diana's name -- not her music -- so I took a chance when this CD kept popping up on my recommendation list.  I'm honest enough to admit that I was somewhat captivated by the cover photo.<br />Unfortunately, the cover photo is about as good as this CD gets.  I really didn't grasp from the other reviews that Diana Krull is a female Frank Sinatra.  Yes, she's apparently a musician as well, but that really didn't come thru to me based on this effort.  As I listen to this I just keep thinking, \\"lounge singer, lounge singer, lounge singer.\\"<br />I'll keep this CD in my car for a week or so and see if it grows on me, but I don't see a lot of promise.
B00004ZD69|5.0|This nine-piece orchestral rock (referred to as &quot;post-rock&quot;), is a band of incredible talent and is some of the most unique and interesting music you can find these days. However it is not for everyone, only for those with a very open mind. The average song length is a vast 23 minutes, however the songs radically change from beginning to end. The Music is dark, depressing, bleak, meloncholic, ethereal and beautiful. Mostly, the songs are very slow and require a lot of patience to listen to. Sometimes you might think it is too repetitive or boring, but you must fully indulge to appreciate this. However, usually it can be difficult to do that, you will most likely get &quot;lost&quot; in the music. There are sometimes ambient, quiet sections but they either suddenly explode into a chaotic rush of instruments, or slowly make their way up to a climatic point, then come crashing back down. Guitars, cellos, and violins are mostly used, and also once in a while, quite mysterious sound clips in the background. Not only does this band have great musicianship and put out an excellent performance, but their songs, mostly on the second disc, give you a exhilarating feeling inside. Personally, I like both songs on disc 2 the best. they seem more diverse and more progressive. If you like the music of Tortoise, Mogwai, Sigur Ros, and other post-rock type bands, or if you're just looking for something different and interesting, this will fit in perfectly in your collection.
B000000OQF|1.0|C'mon, folks! This is just Hollywood stuff. Pretended rebels, pretended punks, fake clothes, lots of overdubs and ultra-kitsch videos on MTV.<br />You can't be serious about this being one of the best things you've heard...<BR>Try harder, there's MUCH more to be enjoyed than this petty appetite.<br />Axl's voice is disgusting and the bass/drums are SOOO predictible.<BR>It's a SIN to compare these guys with a band like Led Zeppelin.
B000069CWE|5.0|Although REANIMATION has mostly the same songs as Hybrid Theory, the songs are so different, it's almost like they're completely new songs.  REANIMATION has a completely different feel to it than Hybrid Theory, but it's still power-charged and fun to listen to.  It's a little bit more laid back and has more rapping and rhyming to it, but it's still cool and has Jonathan Davis and Aaron Lewis adding more flavor to the tracks 1STP KLOSR(one step closer+DAviS) and KRWLNG(Crawling+LeWiS).  I would recommend it to all LP fans.
B00004TRD8|5.0|First off I will say that the DVD itself is possibly the best DVD ever assembled, I mean there are so many special features I don't even know where to start.  Not to mention every special feature you will find yourself watching, including the three versions of the film itself, and at the price it is at right now, this is extremely essential.  Now onto the movie itself.  Arnold is back, only this time he's the good guy.  He's been re-programed and sent back in time to 1994 to protect a young John Connor (Edward Furlong in his film debut) from the new model Terminator, the liquid metal T-1000 (Robert Patrick, who is absolutely haunting).  While on the run from the T-1000, the pair rescue John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton, who has gone from would be victim to gung-ho heroine) who is incarcerated in a mental institution.  I remember seeing this film in the theater when it was released and I remember how awe inspired I was, and I still get that feeling when I watch it today.  The special effects were way ahead of the time, and they still hold up today.  While not as action packed as the original Terminator, Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi action epics ever made, and with this Ultimate Edition DVD, now has never been a better time to own it.
B00000G3PL|5.0|I gave this DVD 5stars for three reasons.  First, because it has both Wide and Full screen.  Second, because it has all four theatrical trailers.  And because they are action packed.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This is the film that cemented director James Cameron as a visionary director, and also cemented Arnold Schwarzenegger as a premier action superstar.  Schwarzenegger is chillingly perfect as the heartless, soulless cyborg killer sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will unknowingly in the future give birth to a son named John who will become leader of a human resistance in a distant future war with cyborgs called Terminators.  Michael Biehn plays a soldier sent back in time as well to protect Sarah and stop the Terminator from fulfilling his mission.  Imaginitive special effects and makeup are abound, and the film is action packed from beginning to end, and all the actors give superb performances, but this is mainly Arnold's show, and like I said before he is chillingly perfect.  A little side note: Arnold was originally supposed to play the soldier sent to protect Sarah, and Lance Henriksen (who plays a cop) was supposed to be the Terminator, but Arnold expressed to Cameron that he would do better as the Terminator, and he was dead on the money.  Look for Bill Paxton as a punk in the beginning of the movie, he has an unfortunate run in with good 'ol Arnold.
B0000640VN|1.0|It never ceases to amaze me that drivel like this gets funding but talented actors and film makers are overlooked by Hollywood and the public at large.<br />Meg Ryan is irritating as usual in recent years in her typical dorky cutsy-poo role.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against her and I think she is a very capable actress but she hasn't reached outside of this type of role since &quot;When A Man Loves a Woman.&quot;<br />Hugh Jackman?  I really don't understand the hype around him, he's not THAT good looking and he's a so-so actor.<br />Breckin Myer was cute as Meg Ryan's brother but what made me stay awake and endure this movie was Natasha Lyonne.  I was shocked she was in this since she's pretty much an indie queen and in my opinion way too talented to take a bit part in this fluff.  Even her part in this can't persuade me to rate this above one star.  Kate &amp; Leopold was just painfully long and SO predictable.  I, too, like the occassional light romantic comedy but c'mon, this just tried my patience.
B000002KHF|5.0|Van Morrison's 1970 classic, Moondance, is the rarest of beasts, a wholly substantial and completely consistent rock album. Never on this spell-binding LP is there a clich&eacute;d or superficial lyric, a lazily-sung word, an unnecessary instrument in the accompaniment, an instance of fabricated artistic posturing and nowhere on Moondance is there a song that is not completely outstanding. Casual classic rock listeners are probably familiar with the dreamy \\"And It Stoned Me\\" and the jazzy title track, but none of these ten songs would sound out of place on a best-of collection. Even lesser known songs such as the bopping \\"These Dreams of You,\\" the emotion-rendering \\"Brand New Day\\" and the simply breathtaking \\"Into the Mystic\\" are compositions strong enough to rival Lennon/McCartney. On Moondance, Mr. Morrison obviously reached a zenith of artistic maturity and focus. The album is a perfect ten.
6303419607|2.0|I didn't bother reading the other review.  Very upset that the trilogy turned out to be 2 movies & 1 making of the movies.  I ordered the trilogy because I specifically wanted the last show-Die Hard with a Vengenance.
B000066I6N|4.0|Some aging classic rockers whose muses are not currently tending to them are smart enough to realize it (although evidently not many). A number of these artists responded by recording collections of cover songs while waiting for inspiration to return. While these releases are certainly not ambiguous and almost never on par with the said artists' top work, they are definitely better than hearing one's favorites stumbling at composing new originals. Bob Dylan, for example, followed 1990's mediocre Under the Red Sky, with two admirable collections of traditional folk songs, 1992's Good as I Been to You and 1993's World Gone Wrong. Metallica, who gravely upset fans with their MTV-conforming 1996 and 1997 albums, Load and Reload, regained some esteem with their 1998 covers album, Garage Inc. Paul McCartney concluded a decade of baffling creative decisions with 1999's Run Devil Run, a very fun collection of fifties pop songs. Robert Plant, who has not been heard from since Walking Into Clarksdale, his ploddingly boring 1998 collaboration with his former Led Zeppelin band-mate Jimmy Page, is the latest veteran rocker to release an album of (mostly) covers, this year's Dreamland.<br />Dreamland consists mainly of songs from the American folk-rock scene of the nineteen-sixties. This is no new territory for Mr. Plant whose live repertoire has always included a few nods to Spirit, Love and Moby Grape. He understands the sonic textures and emotional atmospheres that make these songs tick and that is evident on each of Dreamland's ontarget renditions. He delivers a subtle, lush and ominous take on The Youngblood's \\"Darkness, Darkness,\\" a gently lulling performance of Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren,\\" an excellent, epic and urgent-sounding version of Bob Dylan's \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" and a forceful and combative performance of Skip Spence's' chilling account of his self-destruction, \\"Skip's Song.\\" The decision to write only scarcely (The album contains just two originals) wasa good one for Mr. Plant, only because it clearly allowed him to focus more on vocals and instrumentation. On Dreamland, his vocals are delightfully airy and emotive and the instrumentation is always completely appropriate, warm and encompassing (without ever becoming mushy) on the dreamier songs and twinkling and eerie (without ever becoming sluggish) on the downbeaten ones. Dreamland is obviously a well-planned and proficiently constructed LP. Mr. Plant had likely maintained a thorough understanding of these tunes for years and knew precisely what he wanted when it came time to record them. Likewise, Dreamland is a pleasure to listen to. As mentioned earlier, such latter-day cover collections from classic rockers are unlikely to be great, but they often do make for very pleasing listening experiences. Dreamland is one of the most enjoyable to date.

B000002KBD|3.0|Considering that Van Morrison recorded His Band and Street Choir only months after 1970's Moondance, one would think it would be the same caliber. His Band and Street Choir retains the same jazzy ambience and traditional sense of charisma as its predecessor but the material is significantly weaker. There is a number of love-dovey clich&eacute;s and space-filling do-do-do's and baby-baby-baby's in the lyrics. Listen to the banal \\"Sweet Jannie\\" or the by-the-numbers R&B replica \\"Give Me a Kiss\\" for examples. Also, many of the arrangements fall flat such as the outstretched \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and \\"I've Been Working\\" with its fake-sounding funk.<br />Still, it would have been almost impossible for Mr. Morrison to follow such seminal work as Moondance with a complete dud and His Band and Street Choir presents a fair selection of enjoyable tunes along with the more prosaic ones. There's the toe-tapping \\"Call Me Up in Dreamland;\\" the soaring \\"Street Choir\\" and the invigorating, happy-go-lucky hit, \\"Domino.\\" His Band and Street Choir is not the fortress of substance, quality and raw talent that one might expect of Morrison at his point in his career, but surely includes enough shining moments to be a noteworthy album for his aficionados.
B00005TT77|1.0|\\"You can't reheat a souffle,\\" said Sir Paul McCartney. And the artists on this album have unintentionally proved that he's right! Why try to improve on something that's already better than everything else out there? I almost died after hearing some stupid fool plodding along slowly through \\"Revolution\\"; and a bunch of teenage-sounding guys screaming \\"I'm Only Sleeping.\\" The latter of these two songs particularly made me think \\"They have taken a great song off one of the greatest albums, (\\"Revolver\\") and messed it up, they turned it into a rock and roll thing, when the original Beatles track was more acoustic. There are very few high points, only \\"Two of Us,\\" \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" and \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,\\" which is a great cover. Besides those three, the covers on this album are disgraceful. These singers should be ashamed of themselves.
B0000024SD|5.0|Bringing It All Back Home is a turning point in the career of Bob Dylan and in the progression of popular music in general. The most strikingly revolutionary facet of this 1965 release is the fact that, for the first album side, Mr. Dylan donned a rumbling electric guitar and was backed by a full rock band, an unexpected and, at that time, controversial, move for a leading folk singer. Also important is Mr. Dylan's new approach to lyrics. On Bringing It All Back Home, he employs scribbly, surreal wordplay, inspired by beatnik writers such as Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs. The album mixes rough rock and roll; bizarre, free-flowing lyricism and the social unruliness and artistic boldness Mr. Dylan brought with him from the folk movement, a fantastic combination that moved popular music a step away from its relatively innocent teeny bopper days and a step towards to the realms of counterculture.<br />Regardless of how important the album is (How many people enjoy a record only because it is important?), there is no denying the strength of a majority of its material. Easily the most represented album on Mr. Dylan's many best-of retrospectives, Bringing It All Back Home is an album studded with bonafied Bob Dylan classics such as the seething, anti-exploitation anthem, \\"Maggie's Farm;\\" the surrealistic take on Mr. Dylan's renowned witty spitefulness, \\"It's All Over Now Baby Blue;\\" the tough-talking proto-rap, \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" the ghostly, bleakly toned ode to dope, \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),\\" an absolutely mind-blowing eight minutes of music that does nothing less than brilliantly assess all that is phony, blood-thirsty and soul-draining in society. Music journalist-types will be evaluating the impact of this album for decades to come, but in the meantime, more casual listeners will no doubt be impressed by the sheer weight of the material.
0441172717|2.0|How can anyone find Dune to be entertaining. Frank Herbert rambles on incessantly about politics, religion, and society. There is little action and Herbert never goes into detail about the technologies of his universe. However, he never seems to shut up about his philosophy either. This is a VERY tedious book. The concept is quite fascinating, but the book itself lacks the entertainment factor.
B0000025VU|4.0|1983's aptly titled Infidels represents Bob Dylan's return to secular music after a not-so-well-received trilogy of CCM albums, inspired by his brief conversion to fundamentalist Christianity. While there are no directly blasphemous or offensive lyrics on Infidels, it does sounds as if Mr. Dylan were making up for lost time, indulging in forms of boldness unheard of in Christian rock. \\"Jokerman\\" and \\"I And I\\" employ pungent, outer worldly imagery characterized by a non-specification that has little hindrance of their strength. \\"Neighborhood Bully,\\" \\"License to Kill\\" and the scathingly anti-capitalistic \\"Union Sundown\\" (a song that is as poignant a protest anthem for the eighties as \\"The Times They Are A-Changing'\\" was for the sixties) demonstrate that the cunning social critic that has always resided in Mr. Dylan has awaken with a furor. He even attacks the duplicity and shallowness of the fire-and-brimstone preachers he emulated during his Christian period with \\"Man of Peace.\\" Infidels is a welcome return for Mr. Dylan to non-pious music and an excellent display of the power and bravery his music can possess.

B000055ZB8|3.0|This film is interesting but well within the limits of the 1922 cinema from which it sprang.  Hardcore fans of the genre all know the story about how the filmmaker &quot;borrowed&quot; Brahm Stoker's story of Dracula, embellished it in some ways and released this film without the proper permissions.  The Count is portrayed as a grotesque creature in this version, bringing with him infestations of rats.  There is a twist at the end where this creature shows humanity and self sacrifice which is quite a departure from Stoker's original novel where the Count is hunted down and destroyed in order to save the heroine from becoming a vampire.  All this makes the film interesting but it is a silent movie and therefore may not appeal to most people who just want to pop a movie in the machine on Friday night.  It's nonetheless very much a film for fans that are interested in the evolution of the vampire in cinema.  The film has been called quite extraordinary for its time.  I would still only recommend it to the curious or silent movie fans.
B000060P79|5.0|I came across this CD by fate, and its awsome!! Definetly worth the $$, and you will love it!
B00006G8K0|5.0|\\"The Horror of Dracula\\" is one of the most faithful adaptations of Brahm Stoker's original novel.  Starring Christopher Lee as Dracula, this film tapped the incredible sensuality of the vampire.  The effects are naturally not nearly as good as more modern films but if you want to see a film that really follows both the story and intent of the original novel this is the version of \\"Dracula\\" to choose.  It was a natural predecessor to the 1979 version of he film that starred Frank Langella, which took the mystery and sensuality of Dracula even further.  This film was a bold early step in the direction of the course that vampire films would naturally follow and is still one of the best.  It's a must have for any true fan of vampire films.
B000069CWE|5.0|Reanimation is what Hybrid Theory should have been.

B000035Z3K|4.0|This version of &quot;Dracula&quot; is a movie buff's film.  For its time it was groundbreaking.  Nowadays, it comes across as a little overacted and since it's in black and white a little less than interesting visually.  (Or if you're a fan of black and white films I suppose it could be MORE interesting visually, it's all a matter of perspective.)  It can still be viewed as the &quot;where it all began&quot; as far as how all major films about Dracula would be approached for many years to come.  The 1922 silent film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; presented the Dracula-like character a great deal differently and did not take hold the way this 1931 interpretation starring Bela Lugosi did.  This movie paved the way for the success that the Dracula genre still enjoys to this day.  I'd recommend it to anybody who is interested in seeing the &quot;roots&quot; of the vampire in the film industry.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Resident Evil is a scary, exciting, and fun horror/action film. Fans of the game will appreciate the suspense, and detail that Paul Anderson put into the movie. Starring the amazing Milla Jovovich, the tough Michelle Rodriguez, and the future `nemesis' Eric Mabius, Resident Evil's cast performs very well. Even though the plot is based on a video game, it is still solid, and believable. Another selling point is all the bonus features that the DVD has. With movie comments by Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez, several featurettes, and a Slipknot music video, the DVD provides hours of entertainment, and behind the scenes insight. I look forward to the sequel, Resident Evil: Nemesis, which comes out next year. If you are a fan of the games, or you just want a fun, and action-packed DVD, then Resident Evil is for you.
B00005YJMX|3.0|It's surprising somebody didn't attempt this a lot sooner. This film was an updated remake of the 1922 silent film \\"Nosferatu\\". The end result is effective and much more enjoyable for the average modern viewer. Like the original silent film, the vampire is portrayed as a hideous and sad creature. As in all \\"Dracula\\" based films, the humans must outwit the vampire in order to save the people they love. The film is very well done and would appeal to fans of the more \\"classic\\" horror movie style. With all the high budget slick presentation vampire movies available now this one may fall short for some viewers and may seem a little dated. I would nonetheless recommend it to anybody that would like to see \\"Nosferatu\\" but can't quite bear the idea of sitting through a silent film.
B000002AZ8|4.0|This cd is a good one. Pearl Jam sounds great on this cd. The hits that are on here are &quot;Better Man&quot; and other hits like that. You will be very surprised when you listen to this album. So what are you waiting for? You'll love this cd. Go and buy it today! Thanks!
B000069CWE|5.0|Reanimation is the follow up to Linkin Park's First CD; Hybird Theory. Most of the songs on this CD are remixes from their first CD. The new ones are beautifully mixed and dont really sound like the origanal songs. The only new songs on their are My December, High Voltage, an Excutioners mix, and Mike Shinoda's answering machine. Overall this CD GREAT! Most of the songs are more rap than rock. Just go out and buy it.
B000069CWE|4.0|Reanimation, while not as good as hybrid theory, is still an excellent CD.  It only has one mellow unlike Hybrid theory which had several.  Don't get this expecting it to be the same style as Hybrid Theory.  Also don't buy this if you don't like Rap.<br />Altogether, while it might disappoint some, I would definitely recommend this Cd to any true Linkin Park fan.
B000069CWE|5.0|This Cd is awosme! I reserved mine and then got it the day ot came out. About all the songs are remixes from their first CD, but they are so beautifully mixed they sound completely different. If you are a heavy metel fan and like their first CD you may not want to get this CD because most of the songs are mainly rap. If not go out and buy this CD.
B000002JAX|5.0|I just recieved this C.D. yesterday. I am so awe-struck! Please Madeleine I beg of you &quot;Give Us More&quot;........
B000069CWE|5.0|But this one is definately deserving of the high rating.  It's a nice compliment to Hybrid Theory, which is more rock-based, and Reanimation has a more hip-hop feel to it.  They are true to their form with unique, creative, collaborations and I really think they're opening the door for &quot;fusion&quot; music.<BR>With about 17 songs (20 tracks but some are just clips) I'm definately satisfied that I got my money's worth.  I was not disapointed with the remix of my favorite song, Place for my Head, and Krwling sends shivers up my back everytime I hear it.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album just keeps getting better.  Songs 1-9 absolutely floor me, especially \\"Do You Realize,\\" which contains the simplest yet most thought provoking lyrics in the Lip's career. \\"Do you realize/That everyone you know/Will someday die?\\" it sounds so silly, but it's quite a shock when it comes after lines like \\"Do you realize/That you have/the most beautiful face\\"....fantastic.  I think this album is a much more cohesive work than any of their more recent outings.  Some people will probably think I'm nuts for not liking the Soft Bulletin more than this.  Quite an amazing band.
B000002JS6|5.0|Over twenty years have passed since it's release and all facets of the tribulations surrounding Back in Black's recording have been amply documented (the band's recovery from Bon Scott's death etc...).  But what makes this album stand as arguablly THE testimonial to the brute power (and glory?) of churning guitars, shrill vocals and simply put, rock and roll distilled to it's purest elements?  I'm not certain I have the answer but contained somewhere in this hallmark album's ten tracks lies the solution.  Perhaps this is the fruition of five plus years of hard living, a firm belief in the convictions and adhearance to solid blues based rock and roll or some ethereal connection amongst the brothers Young and Scott's spirit temporarlily embodded in Brian Johnson's howl.  Admitedly it seems odd to attach words like \\"ethereal\\" and \\"spirit\\" to the music of AC/DC but with hindsight being 20/20 and the record's continued success, this album does bear such rewards and praise.  It is devoid of a single weak moment and stands, quite possibly alone, as the one album that trancends genres such as \\"rock\\", \\"pop\\" and \\"heavy metal.\\" Is it an \\"important\\" album like \\"Are You Experienced\\" or \\"Sergeant Pepper?\\"  Maybe so, maybe not.  I side with the former and argue for Back in Black as a nominee for the most virtuous demonstration of absolute rock music. <br />To Bon!
B000002LLC|5.0|I'm Breathless was released in May 1990. It was a moderate success selling 5 million worldwide. This is, as I've said on my reviews of Erotica and Bedtime Stories, another one of Madonna's underrated albums. A companion to the film, Dick Tracy, in which Madonna stars as Breathless Mahoney (hence the album's name), I'm Breathless goes right back to the 1940s. This just proves that wherever Madonna goes in her career, her die-hard fans will just follow it and learn to love it. Her wide versatility to bound from one medium to another proves that all her fans will love whatever she does in the future...<br />I'm Breathless begins with He's A Man (10/10). A perfect song to start off this album, the bassline really gets going with Madonna's soaring vocals. Madonna's backing singers, Niki Haris and Donna DeLory have been with her since her 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour and are still going strong! They deserve credit as their vocals are first-rate on this song too. Track 2 is Sooner Or Later (10/10). This is a really amazing bluesy track that Madonna also performs in the film. Short but sweet, the assortment of no less than 8 instruments (drums, bass, piano, tenor sax, alto sax, clarinet, trumpet and trombone) produce an amazing bassline. This is definetly one of the highlights of the album. Stephen Sondheim also won an Academy Award in 1991 for writing this amazing song. Track 3 is Hanky Panky (10/10). Released in July 1990, Hanky Panky hit No.2 in the UK and was a multi-million seller worldwide. Different to anything Madonna has ever done, Hanky Panky was more tounge-in-cheek and rude than controversial. \\"My bottom hurts just thinking about it\\" croons Madonna along with the re-appearance of Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. Track 4 is I'm Going Bananas (9/10). A very short track at 1:44 but still hilarious and different, you almost forget it's Madonna with her Jamaican vocals. The chanting and \\"ay, ay, ay\\"'s in the background are hilarious. The lyrics are very silly but you just gotta love it! Track 5 is Cry Baby (10/10). A lot of people hate this song and I can see why because the lyrics are a bit silly - but I just love it. Madonna's forced New York accent is superb along with the amazing keyboards and deep bassline.<br />Track 6 is Something To Remember (10/10). The title to Madonna's multi-platinum 1995 ballads collection, Something To Remember is one of Madonna's greatest ballads. Patrick Leonard was Madonna's co-writer since 1984's Like A Virgin. He gives a great performance on the keyboards. This should've been released in the UK but never was...Track 7 is Back In Business (10/10). This wasn't featured in the film but should've been because it's a great song. I like the way the first verse is very quiet then the chorus is so loud and up-tempo. Then it drops very quickly for the second verse. Track 8 is More (10/10). Another great track from Madonna, this was included in the film and rightly so. The bassline is so 1940's. This is definetly one of the highlights of the whole album. Track 9 is What Can You Lose (9/10). The male voice by Mandy Patinkin is amazing. It sounds just like a voice from a black and white film in the 1940's. Track 10 is Now I'm Following You (Part 1) (10/10). Very short but good, this is an up-tempo track with lots of tap-dancing. Warren Beatty who stars as Dick Tracy in the film is the highlight of this song as hit vocals are just as good as Madonna's. Track 11 is Now I'm Following You (Part 2) (10/10). Better than Part 1, this version is much longer, very diverse and very up-tempo! Another one of the albums highlights. The last two minutes ate the best. Track 12 is Vogue (10/10). This sounds very out of place on the album but is one of Madonna's greatest singles. This became Madonna's 7th UK No.1 single in May 1990. It was No.1 for 4 weeks and sold more than 4 million copies worldwide. Madonna's rap on her favourite Hollywood stars is legendary. The classic black and white video is one the greatest videosof all time. Madonna made it hip to vogue as millions of teenagers took to the dancefloor to try out the moves.<br />Overall, you have to have this amazing album. I would definetly consider this one of Madonna's greatest albums even if it was one of her poorest selling. Overall grade: 10/10, A+, 97%.of all time.

B00005YUNY|5.0|Yes are great on this DVD -- their best yet -- but what really makes this one such a joy is the wonderful participation of the orchestra.  Not just the playing and the fun of hearing all the classics with orchestral arrangements, but even more the obvious thrill the experience is for the young musicians of the European Festival Orchestra.  They are on top of the world to be performing with the band.  <br />I don't want to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen the DVD yet just how the young musicians' energy comes through, other than to say it was unexpected, it was a delight, and it was pure.  In that sense, it was very Yes.
B000002MUW|5.0|What a great album by Madonna this is! Released in October 1994, it sold a poor (for Madonna's usual sales) 6,000,000 worldwide. This is, however, one of her greatest achievements. I would say it is one of her Top 5 best albums. This album is mainly an R'n'B/Ballad album. If you liked Ray of Light or Erotica this is for you. If I could describe this album in three words, it would be; laid-back, soothing and different (from her other albums)...<br /><br />1. Survival (10/10) - A good song to start the album. A nice R'n'B/ mid-tempo ballad type of song. This wasn't released as a single but I'm sure I've heard it somewhere before I got this album.<br /><br />2. Secret (10/10) - This was the first single from the album in October 1994. It charted at No.4 in the UK. Another nice R'n'B track that flows along almost unnoticed...<br /><br />3.I'd Rather Be Your Lover (10/10) - One of the stand-out tracks on the album. A really heavy bassline supplied by husky vocals from Madonna. The highlight comes when guest singer Me'Shell just comes in and starts the rappin'!<br /><br />4. Don't Stop (9/10) - Another nice dance-pop track. A change from the usual R'n'B/ballad's of this album. Although Madonna does emphasise the \\"got to see you move it\\" part a bit too much. She sounds a bit excited.<br /><br />5. Inside Of Me (10/10) - This is one of my favourites on the whole album. A really nice ballad that features what I can only describe as an instrument that could be used in the jungle. I think it's a sample from Aaliyah called Back and Forth. This is a really nice ballad with a great sound. I like the way Madonna uses heavy-breathing as a dance beat instead of the usual riff-raff that was being used around the time.<br /><br />6. Human Nature (10/10) - A very clever dance song. Being the fourth and last single to be released from this album in August 1995 charting at No.8 in the UK, Madonna wanted to close the book on the whole sex fiasco. The only way to do this was to come out with one last thing - telling the critics how pathetic they are; \\"Oops I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind\\". Check out the video - very cool.<br /><br />7. Forbbiden Love (8/10) - Probably the worst song on the album. An O.K. R'n'B song that's just a little too flamboyant for it's own liking!!<br /><br />8. Love Tried To Welcome Me (10/10) - My absolute favourite song on the album ever!!! This is SUCH an amazing, laid-back ballad with beautiful lyrics and amazing sounds. Madonna's voice is perfect and the first two seconds sound like an old-faqshioned steam train!!! You could just imagine listening to this on a cold, snowy winter's day or walking around in a field in the middle of the countryside in early spring!!!<br /><br />9. Sanctuary (9/10) - Another nice R'n'B/dance track. The lyrics are good and thoughtful. Sounds a lot like Bedtime Story (the song). Speaking of which...<br /><br />10. Bedtime Story (10/10) - The third single released from this album in March 1995 charting at No.4 in the UK charts. This is very different from anything Madonna had done before. Would fit perfectly on Ray of Light. Check out the video. One word: weird!!!<br /><br />11. Take A Bow (10/10) - Such a beautiful, sultry ballad. The second single to be taken from this in December 1994. It became Madonna's lowest UK chart entry making only No.16 - her first single in the UK to not go Top 10 for 11 years!!! But in the US, it became her biggest single ever hitting No.1 for 7 weeks!!!<br /><br />This is a fantastic album that deserves more recognition than it recieved. An essential in any Madonna fan collection.etic they are; \\"Oops I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind\\". Check out the video - very cool.    7. Forbbiden Love (8/10) - Probably the worst song on the album. An O.K. R'n'B song that's just a little too flamboyant for it's own liking!!    8.

0066620996|1.0|rather then real insight and ideas.  <BR>WARNING: Those who gave this book more then 2 stars are the same same business people who made &quot;Who Moved My Cheese&quot; a best seller.
B000069CWE|4.0|Okay so I am not a die hard LP fan but I do have Hybrid Theory and picked up the new album.  It is great.  It turns old songs into epic jorneys.  I think that this album is very ballsy and I credit it with the fan base.  Don't give up on them becaues it is a remix album.  It's in my opinon as good if not better than the first.
0064471837|5.0|I have read quite a few fantasy/science fiction novels, and to tell you the truth, I have never read anything remotely close to the way this story unfolds itself.  The ways of a necromancer as Garth Nix portrays it is extremely interesting.  How he ever came up with some of the things in the book astounds me.  He does a superb way of bringing everything together at the end of the book.  A definate read for those who are looking for an intriguing book.
B0000026J6|3.0|Laughin Lenny writes great simple melodies and brilliant complex lyrics, but he doesn't seem to take a firm hand when it comes to arranging and producing his records. When he's got sympathetic collaborators who give him folk arrangements, the albums are brilliant. When his collaborators try to bring him &quot;up to date&quot;, the results can be very frustating.<br />The songwriting on &quot;I'm Your Man&quot; is peerless - dry and sombre moralism, witty and self-deprecating. But the production, which may have been &quot;industry standard&quot; in 1988, is now so dated it's a trial to listen to this from start to end. Tinny drum machines, synthesiser washes, cheesy female vocalists. Not everything suffers equally: &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; has a beautiful flamenco guitar counterpoint, and &quot;Take this Waltz&quot; features gorgeous violin and co-lead vocals from Jennifer Warnes. But it's tough to sit through the stuttering artificial drums and sweetly anonymous backing vocals of &quot;Jazz Police&quot;.<br />This is one of the strongest available doses of Lenny's worldview, and I'd love this album like crazy if I could block out the 80's veneer.
B00005MIZ5|4.0|Since I first heard them, Thelonious Monk's Blue Note recordings have captivated me like no other jazz recordings. They are simply the best work by a genius modern composer. While numerous pictures of Monk exist in which he wears the boppers uniform of beret, horn rim glasses and pin stripe suit ( the photo of monk, roy eldridge and howard mcghee-taken in front of Minton's comes to mind) it's a mistake to think of monk as just another exponent of the Bebop school. He is something much more than that-a unique individual in his music, rendering something much more deeply personal...you will hear that in this stellar music. If you like individuality, uniqueness, playfulness and adventure in your jazz, then this is for you. You won't be disappointed.<BR>   My only quibble with this set is that there is simply no reason not to include the July 2, 1948 session either at the beginning of this set or at the end of \\"Genius of modern music, Volume 1.\\" That brilliant session included such classics as \\"Evidence,\\" \\"Misterioso\\", \\"Epistrophy\\" and \\"I mean You,\\" all of which are essential blue note monk tunes. Why aren't they on either of these volumes? There are no time constraints. There's simply no good reason.<BR>   But be that as it may, this is still desert island modern jazz. And you can pick up that missing brilliant session on either \\"The best of monk on blue note\\" or the french CD \\"Thelonious Monk 1947-1948,\\" ; Classics CD 1118. In whatever form you find it, don't miss this superb music.<BR>   And, \\"I mean you.\\"
B00000729S|5.0|Now and again a forgotten \\"rock classic\\" gets rediscovered, the tapes dusted off , a record company pays for a digital remaster, then the marketing machine cranks up and targets suckers like me. I buy the shiny new package, read the breathless liner notes by some Rolling Stone magazine hack for hire, then slap 'er in my CD player. After 4 or 5 plays, I glumly accept that I've been had.<br />This is not one of those albums. This rocks like a landslide. It's simple, stupid, and great. Psychotic raving? Hell yeah. Ridiculous mid song key changes? Toss 'em in. Overamped electric banjo? You betcha. This is like the best tracks on \\"Nuggets\\" magnified to the nth degree.<br />\\"I Hate You\\" was so familiar it was driving me nuts, until I watched \\"The Big Lebowski\\" yet again. It's playing while Walter and the Dude shout at each other in the bowling alley. If it's good enough for the Dude....
0449227421|1.0|So, my main complaint is this-I hate it when characters have ESP and are suddenly able to jump to the right conclusion.  that is annoying.  Unfortunately, that sums up every \\"plot twist\\" in this sophomoric book.  Also, there is no purpose whatsoever for Jeannie's mother in this book-in the beginning she is introduced as having alzheimers and jeannie is just sooo concerned about her and her welfare that she IGNORES her for weeks and runs around with an octuplet.  nice.  That was just plain bad writing.  None of this book was written in any convincing way.  At one point, when the clones are brought up, one character suddenly is hit out of the blue by the revelation that the cloning is to breed the perfect soldier...wha??? ugh.  I can't stand the main character, Jeannie, either.  She is a whiner...and a dumb one to boot (even though it seems she has a degree in computers...no, i mean psychology...no, I mean genetics..again, I say wha??).  Give me Patricia Cornwall and her good research any day over this novel.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My wife and I went to see this movie and we loved it. I have always enjoyed the Toy Story movies, but this was a cut above the rest. Monsters, Inc. is funny and it is a blast to watch- We pre-ordered our copy in April and we cannot wait for it to come!
B000066AXC|5.0|I loved this movie. I saw it 3 times at the cinema, and enjoyed every minute. I saw that others complained about it dullness and simplisity, and it might be right, but I liked it. True, the movie isn't really deep and can't be considered as a documentry movie on the &quot;life and math of John Nash&quot;, yet, it is focusing on the more human part of Nash, the husband, the father, the geniuse and the &quot;carzy&quot;. After I watched this movie and got impressed from Nash's humanity, I went home and learned more about his math. The charming simplisity of the movie, in my opinion, turns on your curiosity, and after you saw the movie you go and read the book, and go and learn more about Nash's discoveries. In short, this movie causes a chain reaction of learning. I think it can be a great movie to show to high-school students in their first lesson of progressive math, it really make you want to sit and solve math problems. (I really enjoyed my final math exam, sitting there with my pen feeling like John Nash, it was cool.)
B00003CXS4|3.0|Not the greatest comedy I saw this year, but I must applaud Brad Pitt in a stellar performance of a incomprehendible piker burned-out bare-knuckle boxer. The flick was fairly drawn out in portions, but somewhat memorable nonetheless.
B00003CXAA|5.0|If you haven't seen these movies yet, you were either just born or in a psyciatric ward. Some people say that these are just movies but, these are works of art. The only people that shouldn't see these are children, the rest of you SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES! These dvds are loaded with extras that will keep you watching for hours. These should be in everyone's home.
0316666343|5.0|This is definitly one of the best books I have ever read.  I was totally unable to put it down.  I felt the pain and the grieving of Susie, her family and her friends throughout the entire book. It is beautifully written.  I will recommend this book to everyone I know.
0380820846|4.0|It wasn't too hard to discern from the other Bridgerton books to know that something must happen between Penelope and Colin.  These two characters were constantly paired off because of Violet's (the Bridgerton mother) tendency to pity Penelope. It was hard not to miss the hints throughout the other books.  However, this book contains a bit of a tease in trying to discover who is the Whistledown lady.  Overall, I liked Colin and Penelope's courtship immensely.  And after reading this book, I'm more interested in knowing what Eloise Bridgerton is about.  The dialogue is witty and there's a tenderness about Colin that hasn't been seen in any of the other books.  It makes him very likable and the match much more believable.  Good charcterization in this book.  You will definitely want it for the collection.
B000069HKH|5.0|Why to write reviews? Well, this album surely needs one. I've listened it now six times and it gets better. First reaction was dissapointment. Oh, yes it was, but i also knew that this was a Bruce springsteen album so I didn't give up.But I did think it was over simplified, lacking energy and too much a september 11th album. Maybe I just wasn't in a right mood or something, but did things change in a few days. Now I enjoy the album more and more each time I listen to it. Band is great and Bruce sounds great too and there is energy and there is message of hope (rising). Maybe the hype is a little too much but this album does deserve attention and listening. A lot of listening. Does it deserve 5 stars or maybe 4? I give it 5 because i can't give 4 1/2. Born to Run and Darkness are super classics and deserve fifteen stars, but this one isn't bad at all. The Rising is here!<BR>And the songs. I like them all. Even the 'Let Be Friends'. But the song 'Paradise' is one the best songs his ever done. That song alone is worth buying this album.<BR>There's a lot of hidden in this album. It's like every really good record out there - it doesn't reveal it's secrets very easily. It's a difficult poem a sort of like koan. There's just this feeling in this album that captures imagination if you let it. It tells you to listen to yourself.  It takes you to a ride. A different kind of ride like before. It themes are universal. You can understand and feel them even outside the context of september the 11th.  It doesn't give you any answers but gives you an opportunity to seekout answers. There's beauty in sadness. That beauty is hope. A hope about humanity and kindness. Thanks Bruce for teaching that through your records. <br />Rock'n Roll is here to stay, rock will never die. Well, not as long as Bruce Springsteen is alive. ... <BR>Love!
B000069HKH|5.0|This album is as good as anything Springsteen has done in his remarkable career.  The sound is fresh, the lyrics are superb, and the band (as always) is simply brilliant.  I know already that this is an album I will be listening to for the rest of my days.
B000065U1N|1.0|Don't Get me wrong, I think Black Hawk Down Is A Great movie, but this dvd [is not good]!!! it has basicly NO extra features. However In a few months a collecters edition 2-disc set of this movie is coming out. I am waiting for that one before I buy this movie. It will be worth it!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I'm referring to the song &quot;No Such Thing&quot;.  I don't usually listen to this type of music, but the first time I heard this song it sent chills down my body.  I LOVE this song.  It just moves me.  It took me a little over a week to figure out who sang it because the radio station I heard it from never seemed to say who sang the song.  I was hooked from the first day I heard this song...I can relate to his words and the music is awesome.
B000001DU5|5.0|Tears For Fears stand out from the other skinny tie wearing,big<BR>hair-having '80s artists obessed with synthizers.Their songs actually had some strong messages in them(i.e. self-assurness;<BR>family;politics,etc.) and they presented a sophiscation that wasn't really prominent in their eighties peers.This greatest hits collection has been getting a lot of play in my house these<BR>days and it STILL sounds relavent in these times.And that's saying a lot! <br />&quot;Tears Roll Down&quot; features TFF's several hits.Mainly from their<BR>hugely successful 1985 smash &quot;Songs From The Big Chair&quot; and their very impressive followup,1989's &quot;Sowing The Seeds Of Love&quot;<BR>.Among the standouts on this set is(suprise,suprise) &quot;Every<BR>body Wants To Rule The World&quot;,&quot;Shout&quot;,&quot;Heads Over Heels&quot;(that<BR>video with the monkey in the library:priceless!),&quot;Mother's Talk&quot;<BR>,and the beautiful &quot;Woman In Chains&quot;,which features strong vocals from Oleta Adams who was featured promintely on &quot;Sowing The Seeds&quot; album.And how can I forget that very song,the lush<BR>six minute Beatlesque relic &quot;Sowing The Seeds Of Love&quot;.Good stuff.<br />Too bad TFF split up but this set collects all their well-known,<BR>memorable hits perfectly.'80s synth-pop that actually has <BR>SUBSTANCE and dare I say...timeless appeal.GASP!(LOL)

0812550706|5.0|I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and contrary to some opinions, very believable.   If you want a complete review, read no further.  If you are interested in why this book delivers convincing fiction, read on:<br />It is often stated that the flaw in Ender's Game is the assumption that a child could become a military genius.  Is it conceivable?  Although Ender is young, he became a military genius in the context of a futuristic war.  In Ender's Game, war is a tactical simulation controlled remotely like a computer game.  In this isolated world where only the \\"game\\" exists, Ender's ability to excel is similar to Bobby Fischer's ability to excel in chess.  Thus, Ender became a general, but not in a form as we would recognize today.  <br />Readers occasionally criticize how effortlessly the main characters gain control of world powers through ficticious personas and the media.  Again, if you find this part unbelievable, think of the future context in which Card presents his story.  In Card's world, the 'net' is omnipresent and media is both centralized and uniformly believed by the masses.  With this type of medium, is it possible for a small group of people to gain control of the powers that be?  (Before the 'net', consider Hitler, Macarthy, Martin Luther King).  Decide for yourself and give Ender's Game a try.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple is just,amazing.Most of the public label Fiona as some  &quot;waifish distrubed firecracker&quot; but she's more than that.Fiona is a sad,kooky,sultry,intelligent women with a sense of what she<BR>wants and who she is even if she's more than a little unsatisfied<BR>with that that.How do I come to this conclusion? Listening to Fiona's remarkable sophmore release,&quot;When The Pawn...&quot;,the followup to her dark yet spellbinding 1996 debut,&quot;Tidal&quot;.<br />&quot;When The Pawn...&quot; is more self-asssured and more even than <BR>&quot;Tidal&quot;,it's obvious that Fiona did a lot of maturing.Opening with the ominus sounds of &quot;On The Bound&quot; with it's scornful piano taps and weird,creepy sounding coda in the middle,it's obvious that Fiona hasn't turned into a cheerful cheerleader yet.&quot;To Your Love&quot; continues with it's sharp drums and a strong<BR>bridge.&quot;Limp&quot; mixes an angsty hook(&quot;My fingers turn to fist/I<BR>I never did anything to you man&quot;) with a memorable drum solo(yes,drum solo).All very deep,well-written stuff like most of the album.&quot;Paper Bag&quot; is a jaunty number that sounds like a semi<BR>sunny ode to love but with a closer listen to the lyrics,Fiona<BR>actually sings a tale of hating oneself after losing out on an<BR>unrequited love.The bossa nova-tinged &quot;Fast As You Can&quot; seems like a skittish mix of two different songs(check the bridge) and the fed up &quot;Get Gone&quot; has all of the soul that say,Mary J.<BR>Blige or even Fiona's labelmate Macy Gray has.Like the more glossy soul &quot;divas&quot; that belt out &quot;I'm sick and tired&quot; ballads,<BR>Fiona sounds like a woman with grace and dignity.Great music,yet<BR>again.<br />So there you have it,Fiona strikes again with what was defintely<BR>of 1999's most special releases.Soulful and wistful,Fiona's still not bright and chirpy.But isn't that what we love? Fiona is way,way,way MORE than the blonde record company createdpop<BR>tools out there.This is grown up music from a young woman whose experienced her share of dramatics.So if she'll  continue to be<BR>wrongfully labeled as an &quot;oddball&quot; time will only tell but Fiona<BR>will most likely stand.&quot;When The Pawn&quot; is great music to listen to when you feel misunderstood.
0761536434|5.0|Viewing the cover of this book and its shamelessly corny title, one might make many different assumptions regarding the content actually covered, none particulary appealing. Fear not. This book is almost too cool for its own good. Instead of taking a boring trip down the technology-heavy history of gaming, Steve Kent enlightens us with a \\"hit-em-where-it-hurts\\" detour of the gaming age. From drug abuse at Atari to Nintendo and Sega battling it out in the halls of Congress, this book doesn't pull any punches. You will certainly not be bored.<br />What makes this book particularly entertaining (and convincing) is the sheer volume of quotes used. Unlike other 'history-of-gaming' books, Kent goes straight to source and gives it to you on a silver platter. This tactic allows Kent to explore aspects of the industry that would otherwise be considered extremely risky.<br />This shouldn't lead one to believe the book is perfect, however. There are many areas that were merely brushed over, and others that weren't mentioned at all. The whole online revolution, for instance, and its tremendous effect on every aspect of gaming, wasn't given so much as a mention. Neither was PC gaming, a subject that merits its own book. Another bit that bothered me was the low key coverage of the original Playstation. Considering how in-depth Kent covers Atari, I think the PS deserves at least equal attention, if not more. While perhaps we don't have the hindsight yet to appreciate it, the Playstation took console gaming, commercially, to places unheard of beforehand.<br />But these omissions can be excused, since what is there is incredibly good. All the main characters are covered (Nolan Bushnell, Howard Lincoln). What makes me extremely excited is that this is just the beginning. In today's world Kent had to make this book less fact-based then he could have, in order to sell it. But what the future holds in terms of video-game history boggles the mind. Kent could have easily written 4 books of this size and still not have covered everything there is to cover. But this is certainly a stellar begginning, and is by far the most exhaustive and yet entertaining account of the video-game age to date.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I have a relatively common hearing condition which causes me difficulty in discriminating a single voice over other voices. This explains why Gosford Park is hard to hear for me, and some other reviewers: the audio consists of many layers of conversation going on simultaneously. In the pivotal after-dinner drawing room scene, there are at least 6 concurrent British-accented conversations layered on top of a paino singer!<br />Never fear. I strapped on a pair of headphones and listened real hard. I discovered this is a GREAT MOVIE!
B00005A46T|4.0|The songs &quot;skin ticket&quot; and &quot;heretic song&quot; are the worst on the CD, everything else is listenable, and &quot;People = S.h.i.t. has got to be the loudest track on the CD.

B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park scores once again with this awesome Cd titled Reanimation.  The remixing is awesome with several rap beats to bob your neck with and guitar riffs simalier to hard rock bands.  This cd is equally as good or better than Hybrid Theory.<BR>It was well worth the wait and new vocal tracks for the words to get stuck in your head again.  Chester's voice once again amazes you Mike's rapping skills shine, Mr. Hahns scratching is a big role, Rob continues with great drumming, Brad has new and improved riffs, and Phoenix has great bass playing and also does all the orchestra instruments to show he's multitalented.  This cd is great.  Take it from me its a record breaker in the making and i am predicting for the second year in a row Linkin Park will have the best selling cd.

The cd features songs from \\"hybird theory\\" but there all completely redone.  Features lots of underground artist's as well as Aaron lewis, The X-ecutioners and more. Lots of rap..                               <BR>However if youre only kinda of into linkin park, dont purchase this cd!<BR>THIS CD SHOULD ONLY BE PURCHASED BY HARDCORE FANS!
B000069HKH|4.0|Q: How important does Bruce Springsteen remain in the eyes of American record buyers?<br />A: What other musician had the weight of articulating an artistic response to 9/11 placed on his shoulders?<br />There is no other rocker alive that I wanted to hear from after 9/11.  I'd love to know what Lennon would have said, but that option remains closed.<br />So this will always be looked at as the 9/11 Springsteen record.  That's too bad, because it distracts from what is a great CD--and it's just not fair to ask Bruce Springsteen to sing away the nightmares brought about by one of the worst stupidities in human history.<br />It's hard to absorb all of a Springsteen album in the initial go-round.  I spend the first few days just enjoying the sounds and then the lyrics and the characters start to sink in a while later.  He is, I've always said, a novelist stuck in a rock star.<br />That said, the first thing I've noticed about THE RISING is that there aren't many characters to speak of.  A lot of this is abstraction--to be completely analytical about it, there are lots of verbs and adjectives and not many proper nouns.  That makes it easier to grab on to some of the sentiment but will, I think, make some of these tunes drop off your radar after a short time.  Kind of like LUCKY TOWN and some of the other non-E-Street records Springsteen has done. (On the other hand, &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia&quot; was a first-person singular tune with no other characters in it, and I consider it one of the Boss's best tunes.  So wadda I know?)<br />THE RISING is a very good record with some great cuts.  After just a few days I'd say I'm hooked on the title track, &quot;World Apart,&quot; and the perfect &quot;Paradise.&quot;<br />Frankly, I think the name of the album could have been called The Awakening, because that seems to be what it's about: receiving a cold slap across the face--literally, metaphorically, symbollically--that wakes you up, points out how the years and the mileshave passed by; trying to make sense of where you are and where you thought you would be.<br />I have only one specific complaint about THE RISING: where is Clarence?  The sax isn't used much on this LP.  That makes about 20 years since the Big Man played a big part on a Bruce record.<br />By the way, if the Letterman appearance tonight is any indication, the Boss is thin again, Little Steven is still wearing the silk do-rag, Nils Lofgrin still doesn't quite fit.
6304696566|5.0|These are the famous words prayed by Hank Worden, as he, John Wayne, Ward Bond, and Jeffery Hunter prepare for an Indian attack.  My favorite of all of the John Wayne movies.  This is a story of a man who has a fericous hatred of Indians that put General Sherman to shame.  General Sherman believes that the only good Indian is a dead Indian.  Wayne's character Ethan beleives that a dead niece is better than a live niece turned squaw.  His neice, Debbie, is kidnapped by by a Commanche Chief named Scar.<BR>     Scar isn't the typical sterotype Indian.  Like Ethan, he is full of hatred and vengence from his dealings in war.  Ethan is a man who dearly loves his neice and gives her a civil war medal.  However, he is also a man who dislike Marty (Hunter) because he is quarter Cherokee whom he regrets rescuing as a baby.  Ethan also has a mysterious past.  He's been missing since the end of the Civil War, shows up with a lot of money freshly minted, and matches quite a few descriptions.<BR>       To ease the tension, John Ford wisely includes some comedy.  Mose Harper (Worden) provides the best as an idoit who's the Texas Ranger's mascot.  Cpt Rev Johnson (Bond)is fire and brimstone whom gets the best of by Wayne and Lt. Greenfield (Pat Wayne!).  Marty accidently marries a squaw and later fight a Seven brides for Seven brother fight with Charlie (Curtis).<BR>     If there's any flaws is that the beautiful Vera Miles doesn't use her natural voice.  And that fight could have been improved upon.  Netherless, these are minor infractiions.  The picture quality could be improved, but the beauty of the Monument Valley is timeless.<BR>    The main theme is the theme of whether love can conquer vengence:  to a certain extent yes.  The ending says it all.  Wayne picks up Debbie and sees her not as a squaw, but as a lost child.  Then when everyone goes in the house except Wayne who walks off and the doors shut.<BR>     Nice features, nothing extra as in a documentary.  The reason forbuying this DVD is for John Wayne's performance and John Ford's directing.
B000002JS6|5.0|While this is(argumably) not the best AC/DC album, it is the one they will certainly be most remembereed for. The fact that the band released this album barely 5 months after Bon Scott's death in itself is remarkable. AC/DC and their newly found frontman, Brian Johnson, buckled down and recorded what is generally cnsidered one of the greatest rock albums in history. Every track, from the hauting \\"hell's bells\\" through the hard-rocking anthem \\"rock and roll aint noise pollution\\" is  a masterpiece, with angus young throwing in some of his best leads yet. personal favorites are hell's bells, shoot to thrill, WDYDFMH, given the dog a bone...ok, the whole album is. this goes beyond essential.
0375703764|5.0|If Orson Welles produced the Blair Witch Project as directed by Stanley Kubrick and adapted from an H. P. Lovecraft story by Bertolt Brecht, the result would be House of Leaves. House of Leaves isn't a story - it's a madcap all-out assault on reason, performed in a maze of mirrors and viewed through a kaleidoscope.<br />This isn't a novel - it's an entertainment, par excellence. I'll be reading and re-reading it over and over again in succeeding years, no doubt exploring formerly undiscovered passageways in the leaves of Danielewski's book that will provoke greater and greater laughter for my having missed them on previous readings. I strongly suggest you do the same.
B00005Q4GV|5.0|The year was 1970, a time for the motion picture indistry when epic war-glory films were dwindling in demand, and a younger generation of self-proclaimed social commentators was moving in fast. It seemed a breed of films was dying, but fortunately, \\"Patton,\\" a poignant biography of the decorated General George S. Patton, gave the genre something to hang its hat on--and set the standard for epic war films, for those to come, and somehow for those in the past.<br />Contrary to the popular summary, this is not a glorification of General Patton, or of war itself; \\"Patton\\" is the insight of a man absorbed in a world of guts-n-glory, a world of conflict between himself, his duty, and the threat of being overun by ego and arrogance. George C. Scott's portrayal of the general will take the viewer's breath away with his brilliant and detailed performance; the brilliance and accuracy of the directing and screenwriting go without saying when one sees the power of the film for the first time. There is no better way to end a genre than to summarize it all with one film; \\"Patton.\\"
6305252521|5.0|This is such a creative movie.  The story of a man's whole life being taped on television in a town that is actually a production set, and he has no idea. The parts when Truman start to find out that something is not right are the best.  Like when one of the lighting fixtures fell from the sky, or when it started raining on Truman but nowhere else.  <br />Are you wondering, &quot;What in the world is this guy talking about?&quot;  If so, pick up a copy of this movie, and all your questions will be answered.
B000003TAR|5.0|\\"In Utero\\" is, without a doubt, the apex of Kurt Cobain's musical and poetic genius. The man possessed an almost surreal gift for transforming pain into art. The songs on this album churn with a beautiful, visceral, wonderfully punk-inspired rawness: Cobain growls and moans with anguished sincerity throughout the entire record,  pouring his prescient, soul-bearing lyrics over a deluge of crashing guitar hooks and thumping drumbeats. His songs succeed in accomplishing the near-impossible: they're both melodic and abrasive, beautiful and disturbing, angst-ridden without being overly self-absorbed. They're at times eerily quiet and at other times blistering with chaotic, guitar-fueled noise. This was the last album that Nirvana would make, and it is my belief that Cobain's vision was never purer or more potently realized. The album was, for the most part, successful in its need to alienate Nirvana from the greed-driven superficiality of the media and the ignorance of the band's shallower fans. It was heated, heartfelt and raw - the perfect antidote to the shamelessly vapid, trite, prefab \\"music\\" that continues to permeate our collective consciousness.  Sadly, Cobain's uncompromising artistry and acute sensitivity to the world around him would eventually be the death of him. He was a brilliant, complex and deeply disturbed human being - truly, one of the greatest artists of our time. To the average skeptic, that last statement may sound like typical hero-worship fluff, but I don't care. In my mind, \\"In Utero\\" is and will remain one of the greatest punk rock albums ever made.
B000068PQ0|5.0|...this is my first Flaming Lips album.  I'd been putting off buying anything because I'd been so disappointed by so many highly-touted albums over the past couple of years.  &quot;Yoshimi&quot; has classic written all over it.  I don't think Wayne sounds as much like Neil Young as he sounds like Jon Anderson of Yes with a slight southern drawl.  And the album vaguely reminds me of Yes, particularly &quot;Close to the Edge,&quot; but without the pretensions or clutter.  I think this is one of the few albums that 2002 will be remembered for in the pop pantheon.
B00005JL3A|3.0|The movie itself was overall enjoyable.  It had terrific special effects, but yet the whole movie was not special effects.  Some of the zombies did have to go on the blue screen, because they couldn't just do that with make-up.  You will understand when you see the movies.  The bad thing about this movie, is the plot, and that the zombies are really the star of the show, not the licker, and not the main character.  The plot was almost laughable, it had nothing to do with RE games, but I'm sure that the &quot;movie makers&quot; had good reason for this.  The characters weren't developed, I only really felt sorry for Michelle Rodriguez, she was the star of the show.  She was &quot;hot&quot; in many scenes with her tom-boyish approach in the movie.  She was the only one the cracked any jokes in this movie.  Milla Jovovich was good, she looked reallll good in clothing that barely covered her.  Thats one reason why I saw the movie.  The licker look just like the game, but the special effects that used to create some part of the licker, except the train scene, were again, laughable.  It looked like the licker was put together in a minute.  I hope they do the RE series justice in the sequel.  As I said before, this movie is for you if you like blood, gore, women in skimpy clothing (Alice), and things lurking around the corners.  The zombies really made this movie bearable to watch, and Milla a.k.a. Alice.

So, I gave them noise!\\"<BR>                                      -Hank Shocklee (Bomb Squad)<br />   A furious mixture of whistles, whines, and noise over dense samples, scratches, and beats which Shocklee later called \\"Music's worst nightmare.\\"  Aside from Chuck D.'s intelligent and thought provoking lyrics and Flavor Flav's hyper-active, idiotic, role playing of the court jester, it was Hank and Keith Shocklee, and Eric (Vietnam) Sadler of the bomb Squad who put PE on the map.  As a whole, the group was way ahead of it's time.  Boldly putting out their political views and  attacking the media, PE was also unfairly attacked in the press portrayed as anti-semetic and anti-white.  <br />From the groundbreaking \\"Bring The Noise\\", to Slayer's guitar sample on \\"She Watch Channel Zero\\", to the pulsating piano chord on \\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\\", PE simply shines.<br />Sad that this group never got the financial recognition it rightly deserved.  Back in the day, I was the only one in the group of friends who worshiped PE.  Everyone else couldn't handle the intelligent lyrics that [weren't] sprayed with 4 letter words.<br />   Feed your brain.  Listen to the genius that was PE and READ the lyrics.
0385501560|5.0|This is probably one of the best Chuck Palahniuk books so far. Its detailed, well written, funny, involving....Its just about everything anyone could hope a novel to be. After reading Fight Club I became hooked on Chuck's books. Now, after reading all of them, I concider Fight Club to be one of his worst books, while Choke and Survivor top the list. Anyway, this is a great read no matter how you look at it. read this book.
B00000I8BX|5.0|You could of asked me last year who Fear Factory was and I would of said, \\"What's that?\\" Before than I had heard the name of the band somewhere and seen T-shirts, and had no idea about them even around the time that Digimortal first came out and I had seen ads and saw the album at Best Buy among a few places. I first started off with that album, then bought this and never turned back. Fear Factory forever!

B000002G6J|5.0|This was one of the finest CD's in production. The music of <BR>Jobim is not just Brazilian, nor bossa nova, nor even <BR>autobiographical, but merely picturesque. You feel easy-going free of the world you live in everyday. You feel as though you are on the Mojave, or on Antiqua. Jobim is always moving, and painting a scene for you to witness with him. Jobim seems to ask us or hypnotize us to Look to the sky, or to see the Red Blouse. It is essential to listen to many cuts on Jobim's songbook, but at least we should kick back, have a cool drink, sit in a hammock, and soak up the WAVE of Antonio Carlos Jobim.
0316666343|5.0|THE LOVELY BONES works on three different levels: as an unconventional mystery, as a view of heaven, and as a Kubler-Ross kind of analysis of the murder of a young girl.<br />  Fourteen-year-old Suzie Salmon is murdered by a neighbor, having been enticed into a cornfield to look at this room he'd built underground. Almost immediately her father suspects Mr. Harvey, the neighbor, but there's not even enough evidence to issue a warrant to search his house. Sebold de-emphasizes this aspect of her story, concentrating on how each member of Suzie's family reacts to her death.<br />  The book in narrated by Suzie, most of the time from her gazebo in heaven. Her take on heaven is rather original. Each person has an individual heaven. There's a jock heaven, there's a dog lover heaven etc. Some of them converge, then branch off in other directions. When Suzie's grandmother dies, she's not part of Suzie's heaven. She liked to drink so she's probably with the other party animals.<br />  Then there's the most interesting part of the book, how the family and her friends deal with Suzie's death. The mother, Ocean Eyes as Suzie's father calls her, runs away from her daughter's death. The father is obsessed by Mr. Harvey, going so far as to allow his surviving daughter to search his house. Lindsey, Suzy's sister, copes by holding everything in. There's a funny scene where the clueless high school principal tries to console her, failing miserably. Her four-year-old brother, Buckley, latches on to his father and won't let him out of his sight.<br />  Sebold's portrayal of teenagers is the best I've seen since DeGrassie Jr. High. Ray Singh, the boy Suzie'd kissed before she died, is one of the first suspects because the police found a love note he'd left in Suzy's copy of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. He's east Indian, wants to be a doctor. Ruth Connors, whom Suzy's spirit touches on her way to heaven, becomes a loner poet who sees dead people. Others are more grounded. Lindsey's boyfriend wants to be a carpenter; his brother is a motorcycle head.<br />  The whole point of the book is how the death of a fourteen-year-old girl impacts so many lives. The book is so topical, considering the outbreak of abducted little girls. Bravo, Alice Sebold!nd wants to be a carpenter; his brother is a motorcycle head.<BR>     The whole point of the book is how the death of a fourteen-year-old girl impacts so many lives.

0060926317|1.0|As an Aboriginal Australian this book made me sick. It is arrogant and self serving, totally disrespectful of Aboriginal people and factually incorrect. Many Aboriginal people have protested about this book and there are more being printed!!??<br />It is the hight of racism to suggest that Aboriginal people need saving by some white middle class woman! We have a culture that is more than 60,000 years old - we have survived more than two hundred of colonisation.  Do you think we need Marlo Morgan to save us? She would be better off trying to save herself.<br />BAN IT!
0316666343|4.0|Ms. Sebold has talent. It's not a gimmick, it is called imagination, a vehicle choosen to tell the story.  It appeared that Susie was in her first stage of her eternity in heaven.  She had still had solid ties to earth, grieving parents, a killer to bring to justice.  Hints were made that she would journey further into heaven after these conflicts were resolved.  Maybe the supreme being would be at the end of her journey.  We do not know.  New age has nothing to do with it.
B000056K04|1.0|I'm sorry.  Dave Matthews Band has to be one of the most overly-hyped and boring bands that I've ever seen.  <br />This album lacks taste, depth and all the other elements to make an album a true standout.  I don't really even know why I bought this album, I thought, maybe I would try to like them this time, but album after album, they are a true bore.  Dave can't sing and most of their music sounds the same.  <br />I would suggest not buying this album - only if you are a true DMB fan.
B000069HKH|5.0|I love the use of incantation - the lyrical repetition of the verses to help invoke a spiritual state of mind.  Springsteen has created a moving portrait of real courage.

068981528X|5.0|I've read and reviewed most of the basic tellings of \\"The Three Little Pigs\\", as well as most of the variants.  Here's my take on it.<br />My favorite variant as a child, this is charming tale reverses the traditional plot.  The pig is now after the wolves, who all live in a brick house, then a cement one, and then one of sheet metal.  Each time, the pig manages to knock it down, until the wolves are forced to change their strategy.  The art is bright and beautiful, not overly cartoony.  The surprise ending is a delight.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Well, even if no one in the band is practicing any Eastern-derived practices such as meditation, this album really appears to capture these sentiments.  There are many songs related to ego, death and awareness of the moment - surely the main pillars for any student of Zen.  Wayne's commentary on the album generally backs this up with such words as<br />\\"To derive one's happiness from only specific moments in time is to miss out on the cosmic accident that is all of life's moments...\\"<br />I bring this up since it is impossible to separate the music from the general 'message', particularly for the Flaming Lips.  There has been a general trend in the albums since \\"Clouds Taste Metallic\\" towards an interesting take on many aspects of life; or perhaps this is simply the Lips' once again messing with our minds...<br />As always these guys are completely non-linear in style and delivery.  Last album we had lush symphony-assisted music, reminiscent of 70's grooves such as the Moody Blues.  Now we're in the 80's with some low-fi electronica.  But unlike the 80's we've got lots of layers and some interesting mixing to boot.<br />Then there's the very noticeable influences starting from track 1 with Cat Stevens.  Or how about that Daniel Lanois bass on track 5?  The Bowie-like guitar on \\"Do you realize?\\"?<br />A great album considering the critical success of the Soft Bulletin.  Wayne's wish is for the listener to \\"just simply be... entertained\\" and I certainly am.  Enjoy.
B00005JLDW|4.0|Reign of Fire is a decent movie. Way better then movies that made a whole lot more. Wish it would make more money. Anyways, the movie is pretty good considering it wasnt anything like I thought it would be. Like a whole lot of people I thought the movie was going to be all action. It wasnt, but I still liked it. It never really slowed down and it kept a pretty good pace. Good movie. You should see it. Its at least worth a rent.

B00004Z4WQ|5.0|To say the least the box office hit &quot;Scary Movie&quot; is a cult phenomenon! It's so funny that you will pass out from all the laughter! The cast is absolutely superb, (which I wish David Cross would've been in this), as well as the jokes. Very few fall flat. It's the usual Keenan Ivory Wayans (Dont Be A Menace, Scary Movie 2) slapstick humor which will leave you with a belly ache! IF you missed this, then pick up a copy, I promise you will love it!
0767020308|5.0|This version is true to the book and the acting is superb.  The novel's complexities are brought out by the actors in subtle ways.  Kate Beckinsale was the perfect choice for Emma because she played her duel layers so wonderfully.  Beckinsale played Emma's intelligence against her lack of knowledge of the world, without being dumb.  She showed that Emma thought she was superior and had to learn that someone's rank in society does not make them a better person.  Mark Strong is great as Mr. Knightley.  He plays it serious and heartfelt.  Strong brought out Knightley's strong beliefs and feelings with grace.  Everyone else was also cast perfectly.  The story was very loyal to the novel.  Emma is funny, but really a serious novel about women's place in society.  This version showed all these conplexities with ease and grace.  It was beautifully shot and directed.   This is truly an adaptation to be proud of and lots of fun to watch over and over. Emma is my second favorite Austen novel on behind Persuasion.  I am glad Austen's less popular works had such great adaptations.  Emma got the right treatment here concidering it was Austen's longest novel...  I am happy to say that enough people liked it to make this great adaptation of her work.
6305508550|5.0|To say the least Beavis &amp; Butthead's creator Mike Judge makes you laugh till you cry again. Only this time its about work. I mean from begining to end you will laugh. I thought I was gonna drop dead about mid ways through. My favorite character without a doubt is Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), who is put through hell at work, even though he was laid off five years earlier, and by some glitch in the payroll system, he still recieves a paycheck! (I mean he's hilarious)! Im gonna go by saying the same thing Milton always said to his bosses, &quot;Okay, I'll set the building on fire&quot;. Dont Miss This!

B000065U1N|3.0|Black Hawk Down is indeed a good movie, but the critics and fans over praised it. It does indeed have Oscar worthy directing at some points, but at others I think Ridley Scott over did it. The acting is about average (nothing to talk about I guess). The visual effects are about up to par with Saving Private Ryan, they are that good. But at some points your just begging for it to go ahead and end. The story telling is horrible, which leaves a gap in whether or not you would care about the characters. (Which you don't, or I did'nt). I think BHD did deserve the two Oscars for Best Editing &amp; Best Sound, but thats it. I wouldnt own the DVD either, why you may ask? I have two reasons: #1 The DVD has NO Special Features #2 the movie isnt worth owning. For a older release movie rental just to pass time, I would recommend this, otherwise, save your time.<br />Other Films Recommended In This Genere:<br />- Windtalkers (2002)<BR>- We Were Soldiers (2002)<BR>- Behind Enemy Lines (2001)<BR>- Band of Brothers (2001)<BR>- Saving Private Ryan (1998)<BR>- Platoon (1986)<BR>- Apocalypse Now!

0790731894|3.0|*<br />First of all, there is absolutely no question about the entertainment value of this movie.  When I received it, I watched it twice two days in-a-row!  It is an excellent action movie if you like hostage/terrorism themes.<br />Although there have been complaints about Seagal's early demise, I am neutral about it.  He played a great part and his role/performance was effective.<br />Mostly, I review the quality of the DVD so here we go:<br />\\"Widescreen review\\" must be crazy with their 5.0/picture, 5.0/sound, or I didn't receive the same DVD.  The picture is pretty bad for a 1996 film (released on DVD approx. two years ago).  The picture is grainy with various spots and blurs.  At times, there are blue lines around the actors' faces, and it's not from anything glowing, either.  It is just poor quality.  The DVD starts right away without going to the menu.  <br />The best sound comes at the beginning of the movie with some cheesy words typing across the screen and the effect follows the typing from left to right.  Was that necessary?<br />My picture rating:  1.5 at times, 3.0 maximum in the best shots.<BR>Sound:  3.0 overall<br />I hope that they remaster this movie in the near future.  Clearly, this film was slopped to DVD just to make hasty sales.  If you don't mind the [bad] picture, by all means purchase this DVD and enjoy!  But I would wait another year or so.  It doesn't look like it has a lot of sales so a new release may never happen.<br />Oh, entertainment rating on a scale of 5:  my vote = 6.0!<br />*
6305897786|1.0|If you were able to stay awake through this movie, then congratulations.  I did too....barely.  I really had high hopes for this movie.  I love a good story, even if there isn't a lot of action, but this is ridiculous.  In all, there was about 20 minutes worth of interesting scenes.  The rest is Johnny Depp bumbling around Europe.
B000069HJI|4.0|How does a band follow up a mega-smash album? Simple: they just follow it up. 1979's \\"Breakfast In America\\" was such a gargantuan success all over the place for Supertramp, that, after the world tour in support of the album, the band took some well-deserved rest for a couple of years before re-grouping for their next disc. However, one of the band's key members, singer/songwriter Roger Hodgson, wasn't so sure about his future with the group, and the next album, 1982's \\"Famous Last Words,\\" would be his last album with the band (hence the title?). As Hodgson's swan song with the group, \\"Famous Last Words\\" certainly has an element of sadness attached to it, and although the album did not signal the end of Supertramp, it did signal the end of an era. It was nowhere near as commercially successful as \\"Breakfast In America\\" (how could it have been?), but \\"Famous Last Words\\" is still an excellent, heartfelt album filled with the high quality mix of pop, jazz, & rock that this great band are famous for. Hodgson's opener, \\"Crazy,\\" is a great piano-thumper, while co-leader Rick Davies' \\"Put On Your Old Brown Shoes\\" is an excellent shuffler to clap along to. Hodgson's \\"It's Raining Again\\" is a very nice, uplifting song (and a Top 20 hit single), and \\"Bonnie\\" is a great showcase number for Davies. Next up is Hodgson's haunting, achingly beautiful \\"Know Who You Are,\\" one of the very best songs he has ever written. Davies then picks things up with the great 50's fun of \\"My Kind Of Lady,\\" followed by Hodgson's majestic \\"C'est Le Bon\\" (featuring Ann & Nancy Wilson of Heart on background vocals), and finally, for a powerful one-two punch of dramatic Supertramp rock, there's the double-header of Davies' \\"Waiting So Long,\\" and Hodgson's grand finale---and, judging by the lyrics, his farewell to the band---\\"Don't Leave Me Now.\\"After the tour for \\"Famous Last Words,\\" Roger Hodgson left Supertramp, apparently because he & Davies could no longer agree on the band's musical direction (Hodgson wanted the group to stay more pop, Davies wanted the group to be more jazzy). Since then, Rick Davies continues to helm Supertramp on his own, and the band has since recorded four great albums, starting with 1985's \\"Brother Where You Bound,\\" and continues to tour. Hodgson has also recorded four fine solo albums since his departure from the group, and he recently went on tour with Ringo Starr, so both camps are doing just fine. While Hodgson may not be interested in returning to Supertramp (and he has said as such), we can be grateful of the terrific music he did make with the band---seven albums worth, in fact, as well as the live double-album, \\"Paris.\\" \\"Famous Last Words\\" is a fond farewell to Roger Hodgson, and a lovely album to close out his time with Supertramp. A definite must-buy. :-)
B000069HKH|5.0|A mature, thoughtful disc, packed with emotion and great music.  Springsteen goes into new directions with his music that work beautifully and the spiritual side of the songs is transcendant (especially the chorus to Into the Fire).  It's great to see Bruce dealing with issues that really mean something to him and communicating with such eloquence.  Throughout his career Springsteen has demonstrated his integrity as an artist taking chances when the easier road is the one traveled before(following the River with Nebraska?  Blew my mind).  This disc goes to the top of the list of my favorite Bruce albums (I'd put Born in the USA dead last if you want a frame of reference); and is easily the best disc I have bought in a very long time.
6304493681|4.0|This is truly a great anime, with stunning graphics, great action sequences and marvelous characters. The first time I saw it, I didn't understand the story or what the characters were trying to accomplish. The second time I understood more of the story itself, and noticed little details I skipped when I viewed the movie the first time. Even though I viewed this movie countless times, there are still new things I discover every time I see it, and more of the story I understand. Still the story seems somewhat confusing to me, especially with the extremely confusing ending. I recommend this movie to any anime fan whose looking for a serious movie, with a lot of mystery in it. There isn't too much fighting in it, but the few action sequences are marvelous. The graphics were stunning, with amazing enviorments, and beautifully textured characters. I recommend borrowing or renting it if you aren't serious about anime...yet. To completely get the whole movie, you have to watch it three, or at least two times. But overall, this is a fantastic movie.
0780020685|5.0|I was simply amazed watching this film at how simple the tale was but at how masterfully crafted and told the story was written. This movie will seriously play upon your emotions and only a cold-hearted person, without emotion wouldn't be able to connect to this plot. Compassion, sadness, desperation, love and triumph are all prominent in this film. And the balance between these elements is impeccable.     The cinematography is masterful. There is an intense attention to detail. Every shot is masterfully done. The atmosphere will pull you right in. The acting is top notch and there absolutely no room for improvement in the script. It's just hard to say something bad about it. Even being a foreign film, Japanese too -[and you know Japanese and Chinese movies have a lot of mythology involved that is hard for us Americans to understand.]- but the plot is truly one that is worth high praise. Seven Samurai is a roller coaster of emotions and it gives an in depth view into the mind and soul of the warrior spirit. Seven Samurai is the best movie I've seen in a long time and definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. I'd gladly recommend this movie to anyone. 5 glowing stars. 10 if they were possible.

B000065V1V|3.0|I was so excited to buy this CD after all of the raving reviews I read on this site. Unfortunately the CD really doesn't feel like a return to form. It still doesn't feel like he's really writing &quot;songs&quot;, i.e. he's got a guitar in his arms and has a melody in his head and puts it together that way. Instead it seems like there's some sort of loop in the studio that he improvises vocals over, and because of this, there aren't strong melodies and there's a lack of harmonic movement in the songs. They basically just drone on and on.<br />I think people are responding to the sonic quality of the CD, more than anything. They like the fact that there are elements of his old music: the overdubbed saxophone, Tony Visconti's bass playing, etc. It reminds listeners of his old music. BUT STILL, the songs just aren't there, folks. The reason people are responding to his covers of Neil Young and the Pixies' songs is because, yes, they are SONGS.<br />Will anybody be covering Bowie's songs from this album years in the future? I don't think so. This CD will be in the used bargain bin a year from now, if it isn't already.
0060171928|5.0|that lasted three months.  Marlo Morgan embarges on a journey deep into the mysterious origin of the human soul by finding herself in the company of Australian Bush People.  Her story is a master piece of style and suspense, iridescent nuances and intelligent insight.  Being raised in a left-brain world to become water.... is a miracle.  Mutant Message Down Under is one of the greatest books you will ever have the privilege to read. Left-brained critics on their dishonest search for the truth give this \\"hoax\\" only one greedy star.  If I had more stars, I would add a few from the Milky Way.  gerborg
B00003OO3O|5.0|Doesn't quite have the production that obesseion or lights out did, but this cd maybe ufo's best material wise. Shoot, Shoot basic straight ahead hard rock song, out in the street kind of ballad type song, too much of nothing, dance your life away( great southern style rock like solo in it), this kids with in between in the walls coming in perfectly afterward..all songs on this cd are excellent. If haven't bought it do so
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is just a tadpole in the music world, but she has entered this vast and competitive field with a vengence. Her album, &quot;Let Go,&quot; is one of the best albums I've listened to in a while. I can honestly say that I like every track and people shouldn't base their opinions on her breakout single, &quot;Complicated.&quot; She also has a number of great songs, such as: &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; I'm With You,&quot; and &quot;Naked.&quot; Her punk rock/pop style is one that will set well with anyone who cares to listen. Not only are songs a blueprint of herself, but the lyrics are all hers also. It's refeashing to see a young artist come out with a CD that's all their own music instead of the manufactured sounds of Britney and Christina. I reccommend that anyone interested in finding a new artist with style pick up Avril Lavigne's newest release.
B000069CWE|3.0|First off, this CD falls short of Hybrid Theory's water mark by a long shot, but admitted that's a lot to live up to. So fan's waited about 3 years and this is what we are given, a bunch of retooled, recycled, and retarded remixes. my advise is buy it from the bargain bin or just down load it, not worth you money...
B000069CWE|5.0|This is basically a remix album of Linkin Park's previous awesome sounding album, &quot;Hybrid Theory,&quot; With 2 new tracks added in, High Voltage, and My Decemeber, both of which are remixed previously unreleased tracks. But my, my. If you liked Linkin Parks last album, consider this: 1. Did you like the rapping or the Rock solos in Hybrid Theory? If you liked the rap part better, you'll probably think that the songs sound alot better on this CD. If you like the rock part more, hold buying the CD and listen somewhere before you buy. If youre a big metal junkie who listens to Korn besides Linkin Park, you will be a bit dissapointed by some of the tracks on this album. If you liked BOTH the rap and rock parts of Hybrid Theory, which is one of the most revolutionary CD of rap/rock for the new generations I've ever listened too, then you will LOVE this Cd. Some songs sound a bit better then the originals, while some remixes sound like whole new songs. They put a rap version of In The End which is one of the dopest songs on there. If youre a rap/rock fan, though, is a ABSOLUTE MUST BUY for your collection. I guarantee you will not be dissapointed with this album unless you strongly detest rap or hip-hop.
B000002I2M|5.0|Just when they made such a great album, Jim had to go and get himself dead.  But nonetheless, before he left us, he and the rest of The Doors gave us their best album.  &quot;LA Woman&quot; and &quot;Riders On The Storm&quot; are excellent epic songs in the tradition of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; and &quot;The End.&quot;  The WASP is that funky blues that The Doors were great at, similar to &quot;Roadhouse Blues.&quot;  Jim's incredible &quot;vocal guitar&quot; on &quot;Cars Hiss By My Window&quot; is truly something to behold.  Just great Doors, wonderful music, some of the best ever written.
B000002LEU|5.0|Everytime I hear &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; I almost want to cry. It's one of the most beautiful songs ever made, and musically it's flawless. The combination of everything, guitars and synth, is perfection. I don't know how to describe it -- if you haven't heard the song, give it a listen sometime and see how you like it. It's simply one of the best songs ever made.<br />I know I haven't spent much time on the other songs, but the other songs are incredibly top notch. &quot;She's Lost Control&quot; is a classic, as is &quot;Warsaw.&quot;<br />Any amount of money is worth these beautiful songs.
B000002UAO|5.0|Very folkish.  Kind of country.  Soft and gentle.  Over flowing with beautiful melodies and toe tapping rhythms.  It's just so good that I don't know where to start song by song, but I do know that I can say that this is just about as good an album as can be made.  There are three essential albums in my opinion: Dark Side of The Moon, Revolver and Rubber Soul.  Essential: that's the best word to describe it.  &quot;Drive My Car&quot; is full of jive, &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is probably the best story song ever written, &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; is probably the best Beatles you've never heard and the best song on this album.  It's landmark and monumental and just so inspiring to make me want to form a band and make music just like it.  You better &quot;Run For Life&quot; and get this album.  &quot;In My Life&quot; is the most meaningful song I've ever heard.  It applies to everyone in some way, even if you don't know it.  This is just so good that I can't even begin to put into words just how much it means to me and the music world as a whole.  There would be no music world without The Beatles and there would be so many fewer bands if not for this album.  Essential, you must buy this album.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I think that the time machine was a great movie. it all started out when his fiance emma died. he tried to go back to the past with his timemachine to change the past. but, she was destined to die that night . so , he went to the future for some answers. Why instead of me telling you about the movie . why don't u go rent or buy it today! I recommend to get the dvd. dvd has better quality.
B000002I25|5.0|Along with Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, this is one of the greatest debuts ever. It has \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"The End\\" which set the tone for those epic Doors songs we're so familiar with. \\"Break On Through\\" is the one everyone knows, just a firey and driving and out of control song that just makes you beat your steering wheel as you drive or drum along in the living room as you hear it on the radio. \\"The Crystal Ship\\" is the most beautiful and melodic The Doors ever got. Followed by the raucous and punchy \\"Alabama Song,\\" the funnest drinking song ever. Then its predecessor, 20th Century Fox is about as pop as The Doors ever got but it's still a damn good song on a damn fine album. Check it out, it's great.  Theren't many albums to which I can give a higher recommendation.
B000069HKH|5.0|Why I love the Rising:<BR>1. It sounds so fresh and new, not at all like he's trying to be a cliched version of his old self. Yet it also captures much-loved and familiar essences from every one of his previous works! <br />2. I have managed to overlook the pathetic (on the media's part) marketing of this as solely a 9/11 album, and instead let myself become re-aquainted with all of the emotions surrounding our country post-9/11 on the level that Bruce himself intended! All of our hope, grief, sadness, uncertianty, anger, and worry that came out last autumn is embodied PERFECTLY and SINCERELY as only Bruce could be expected to do!<BR>Also, not all of these songs were even written post-9/11, (i.e. Further on up the Road was written a few years back; My City of Ruins was originally about Asbury Park NJ and had been a concert favorite since 2000!; And \\"You're Missing\\" is actually a re-working of an old outtake that never made it onto an album thus far - of course the reworking is VERY reminscent of 9/11 and largely due to the telethon on 9/21, so is My City)<br />3. There is a superb blend of the poetic ballands AND the rock n roll Bruce has been known for! No matter which 'era' of Bruce you like, you will find its resonance on here!<br />4. Now, I personally love Bruce no matter what band he's with but I am sure enthralled that the E Street Band is back on this CD!!!!<br />5. The fan who told Bruce \\"We Need You\\" right after Sept. 11 was SO right! In all my times of trouble I have always turned to Bruce for comfort, solace, and inspiration to move onward, and this CD is right up there with \\"Drive All Night\\", \\"Promised Land\\", \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\", \\"Janey Don't You Lose Heart\\", \\"When You Need Me\\", and the Live in NYC \\"10th Ave. Freeze Out\\" (It's all right now!!). <BR>I mean, as with \\"Drive All Night\\", \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" sounds like he's singing right to me, telling me personally to be strong! And I nearly died when I heard him use my favorite hard-luck phrase, \\"This Too Shall Pass\\" in \\"Lonesome Day!\\"<br />6. The music and lyrics are perfectly matched and create one of the best CDs ever! It's so hard to come up with the right phrasing to describe it! (I'm not as good a writer as Bruce!) But all I can say is, it is one of his BEST!!! And everyone knows how great Bruce's best is!!!<br />And a few notes about the tracks: <br />\\"Mary's Place\\" is the new \\"Out in the Street\\"!<BR>I LOVE the opening to \\"Empty Sky\\" (and the rest of the song, too!)<BR>The gospel choir on \\"My City\\" and \\"Let's Be Friends\\" rules!<BR>I love the exotic sound of \\"Worlds Apart\\"!<BR>\\"Paradise\\" is haunting and \\"You're Missing\\" always makes me cry!<BR>Ignore the negative comments: \\"The Fuse\\" is a great song full of imagery and mood and it turns me on, too!<br />And to top it all off I'll semi-quote \\"Countin on a Miracle\\"<BR> If I'm gonna live, I'll lift my life, Darlin', to Bruce!!!<br />What a fabulous CD! Thank you Bruce and E Street Band! You are the best!!!
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band???  Oh no, no, no!  This should have been named &quot;Rebellion.&quot;  Take that dirty record executives.  Just by looking at the cover of this album, probably top five album covers of all time if not the best, just by looking at the cover, you know this is going to be something special.  And it was so much more special than I think any of The Fab Four could've imagined.  It's begins with a distorted and very funky guitar in the introduction of the much slower and much more melodic and gentle &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends.&quot;  On to &quot;Lucy In The Sky&quot; full of its surreal images, then &quot;Getting Better,&quot; it's funky opening licks, then &quot;Within You, Without You&quot; is about as deep and poignant as a song can get.  The there's the utterly sad and depressed &quot;She's Leaving Home.&quot;  Beautiful melodies on that song and the jaunty and fun number &quot;When I'm 64.&quot;  To think that this album could get any better is clearly unthinkable, but just when you thought it was over, &quot;A Day In The Life,&quot; some say the most controversial song of all time, is the perfect hallmark of this landmark and monumentally momentous album.  In 1966, John Lennon said The Beatles were bigger than Jesus.  Well, they may not be bigger than Jesus, but after you listen to this, you just might think that Jesus talked to John and the boys and asked them to write the most quintessential album, maybe even the soundtrack of all humanity and put all of that nonsense behind them.  I hear The Big Guy is a big Beatles fan anyway, so no harm done.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|Ryan Adams is essentially a kind of country beatnik. Spurred on by love and drink he is kicking with extreme musical energy and impetus that cannot be hidden nor completely satisfied. His second solo effort Gold probably doesn't come close to doing the job but that's not to say it isn't a damn fine record. Adams wears his influences on his sleeves and they are many, varied and well chosen. Pieces of  Steve Earle, Neil Young, Gram Parsons and Dylan are scattered throughout Gold but Adams is no poacher, he's just kind of hybrid. A gifted songwriter, he mixes sultry ballads (La Cienega just smiled) , anthemic country  (Somehow Someday) and  frenzied blues (Gonna make you  love me) , his southern rasp the perfect vehicle for his tales of lost women and folly. Ones only major complaint would be that Adams has a tendency to overindulge. Yes we all like enjoy a good rocking but many of the tracks here are far too long and subsequently lose their appeal. This is a minor complaint however and on the whole Gold is a more than satisfying record from an artist with a considerable amount of talent.
B000002UB3|5.0|Arguably, &quot;Something&quot; is the best Beatles song ever recorded.  &quot;Come Together&quot; is funky John Lennon with The Beatles most toe tapping beat, very funky.  &quot;Her Majesty&quot; is a cute little ditty, just a little something extra to add on top of perfection.  &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; is a melodic wonder.  &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; is a piano driven blues number.  The suite of last several songs is like the second act of some masterpieceof a stage production.  &quot;She Came In Through The Bathroom Window&quot; is just plain solid Rock 'n' Roll.  This is a phenomenal album, masterpiece is a more apt word for me to use, and I find it hard for anyone to say that this is not perhaps the second most monumental album ever recorded, behind only Sgt. Peppers in over all effect and long lasting appeal.  Just damn good!
B00005JL3A|4.0|For anyone who has the strategy guide to the new GameCube edition of the original Resident Evil game, you'll find that the development team of RE has called this movie a good \\"trailer\\" (whatever that means) and that Milla Jovovich did a good job with it. This leads me to believe that Capcom isn't overly happy with the end result. Who cares...it's solid in it's own right and doesn't pretend to be the game, but rest assured it is well based upon the concept of the game franchise, maybe more in spirit than actual application and a welcome addition.<br />Of the horror films that have come out in recent years, excluding Hollywood smashes such as \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" or \\"The Others,\\" and so on. \\"Resident Evil\\" happens to be the best, more intelligent than \\"Jason X,\\" and the last 2 \\"Alien\\" movies.<br />The movie begins with a very familiar concept to the hardcore RE gamers. The breakout of the virus, S.T.A.R.S. team infiltration, and so on. I don't feel the need to rewrite the synopsis of the movie, which you can get from the Official movie website and Amazon's own review. What I am going to say is that there's plenty of action, gore, mutated zombies, zombie-dogs and so on. Milla Jovovich will keep keep you enthralled herself, I guess that's reason enough for men to see it, ya? The \\"Red Queen\\" is the eeriest thing in the movie, \\"You're all going to die here.\\" Not an original line, but the visual and tone of her/it is quite enough to give you the chills. I recommend watching the movie to find out what the \\"Red Queen\\" is. To me that was a reason to stay in my seat and be thankful that there were other people in the theater. The DVD is a hit, sharp, crisp, and chillingly Gothic. All the things I love.<br />I gave it 4 stars because I wanted a game controller. No I didn't, believed that didn't you? The reason I left one star of is because the movie is shorter than what it could be, even though it doesn't appear that way when watching it. All thing's being equal, well that's a crock line, but who cares, ya? If you're a horror fanatic, or like the occasional, twisted and demented scare, this one's a good choice. &lt;P...ock line, but who cares, ya? If you're a horror fanatic, or like the occasional, twisted and demented scare, this one's a good choice. <P...
B00000253N|5.0|OK, let me get this straight, the first track on this album is \\"Tangled Up In Blue,\\" right?  This album begins with \\"Tanlged Up In Blue???\\"  Honestly, I can not possibly think of a bigger and better song to begin an ablum with, because it is a truly epic masterpiece, and then the rest of the ablum gets better, every other track all the way to the end.  \\"Simple Twsit of Fate,\\" \\"You're  Big Girl Now,\\" \\"Idiot Wind...\\" you just can't go wrong with this album.  Every song has that Dylan magic just spilling out of every chord and bursting out of every note, that tired and hurting voice on just such beautiful lyrics on songs like \\"Shelter From The Storm.\\"  Every Dylan song is a chapter and every album is a novel, filed on the shelf with the other masters of the English language like Shakespeare, Hemingway, Steinbeck, O'Brien, Wolff... this is a masterpiece.
B00005QG9J|5.0|this album has great stuff if u like ll kinds of music then morning view is the album u wanna buy. If u dont like this kind o music then dont listen to it. Most ppl think incubus sold out but acutally there just tring something new theyve done alot gone from hardcore to hip hop alternatve to softer music incubus can do it all. Great Album.
B0000020C4|5.0|Whether you're rating this recording or one of the many others, this is about as good as a musical can get.  It is a faithful addaptation of the classic Victor Hugo novel, one of the finest books of all time, and is awe inspiring every time I listen to it.  The music is memorable, such highlights as \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" and \\"Castle On A Cloud.\\"  The struggle is timeless: good versus evil, love triumphing over adversity.  The roles are complex and diverse: men of wealth, men of poverty, men in power, men in the dregs.  The orchestration is sweeping and classic, near impossible to top.  The lyrics and book are momentous and meaningful and full of emotion.  This is about as good as a musical should be and about as good a muscial as your going to find, anywhere.
B00005NWM3|2.0|As in mono-tonous.  Every songs sounds the same....Even my kids quickly tired of this one.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is so uncharacteristically Beatles, but it's so familiar all the same.  The best song on here is &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps.&quot;  Just that title alone is enough to make me weep.  It's beautiful, so poetic.  &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun,&quot; who would've ever thought we'd hear The Beatles singing that???  &quot;Back In The USSR&quot; is funky and up beat and it just makes you wanna get up and dance.  &quot;Birthday!&quot;  How unexpected is that???  &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is the hardest rocking Beatles song and it's all about a slide, go figure.  No one but The Beastles can do that.  This is the album that makes us all relaize that Rock 'n' Roll doesn't need flaming guitar heroes to be great Rock 'n' Roll.  Ringo's gentle and soothing vocals on &quot;Goodnight&quot; are just so beautiful and calming.  You don't expect to hear this sweeping orchestral number to end of this album, let alone come right after &quot;Revolution 9.&quot;  &quot;I Will&quot; is that familiar Paul we all know and love.  &quot;Piggies&quot; is the same socially critical George we remember from &quot;Taxman.&quot;  &quot;Martha My Dear,&quot; &quot;Don't Pass Me By,&quot; &quot;Honey Pie&quot; and &quot;Why Don't We Do It In The Road..&quot;  This is a phenomenal, unbelievable, remarkable, unforgettable, landmark, controversial and all in all groundbreaking album that must be listened to and admired by all.
B000020617|5.0|There is truly nor arguing taste.  For my money this recording is one of the most delicious sounding of the past couple of years.<br />Lush and lusty...<BR>Big and busty...<BR>For tart and tawny...<BR>It's all so big and brawny...<br />Though my musical sensibilities span centuries (not just rock decades) a person can't help but feel they're on to something when the intergenerational thing happens.  Both my kids and I give this one the highest marks...<br />And I for one can hardly wait for the Grohl's next release...cause it's all good on this one...
B000050HTO|4.0|The Essential Bob Dylan??? Oh no, no, no!!! There is no such thing as the essential Bob Dylan. I find it impossible to stop anywhere short of The EVERYTHING Bob Dylan. Honestly, you can't just listen to these thirty songs, as great and glorious as every one of them is, but you can't stop there. There are so many other great and utterly phenomenal songs, song so great that it justs make you sick that one person can be blessed with such groundbreaking talent. This is Bob Dylan for Pete's sake! You've got to listen to every Bob Dylan song there is because there is no Bob Dylan experience short of listening to evry damn song!!! Bob Dylan is a legend. A master. THE master.
0316666343|5.0|I actually bought this book on the recommendations of Amazon, and am I glad they were right on....When I first started the read, I thought I would be to consumed with actually plot, but was I ever surprised.  I finished it 2 days ago, and I still can't stop thinking about Susie and the possibilities...I actually was using a highlighter and underlining certain passages, because they truly moved me to halt and contemplate on the hereafter.   EXCELLENT, first novel, can't wait for more.....
B0000024SI|5.0|It's Bob Dylan.  It's Highway 61 Revisited.  It's &quot;Like A Rolling Stone.&quot;  It's &quot;Desolation Row.&quot;  It's Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisited.  What more do I need to say?  You've got one of the greatest song writers of all time, writing songs as the greatest song writing/story teller of all time.  This is a landmark.  A positive zenith of music making, for everyone who ever strummed out a chord or belted out a tune.
B000069HK2|5.0|I first heard of The Used on the Atticus compilation, (which I bought for the GlassJAw song cause their new cd wasn't out yet)  after looking to see if there were any other good bands on it, I found &quot;Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot;. <BR>So after being addicted to &quot;Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; for about two weeks, I decided to give them a try (I HATE pop-punk, by the way). The cd instantly was glued to my cd player, and I was into all the tranks except 3-5, but I figured it was the newness of the cd that compelled me to keep pressing repeat. Now after about a month of constant listening, (I listen to it the whole way through 3 times a day) the songs still remain fresh every time.<BR>&quot;Maybe Memories&quot; blew me away from the opening vocals, and the melody in &quot;Noise and Kisses&quot; (fav. song) is amazing. The lead singer has such a perfect voice, and his screaming is so...so perfect. Really every song after &quot;Poetic Tradegy&quot; is great. 3-5 get annoying, mostly because they're kinda pop-punkish, but that is but a mere scratch to how great this cd really is.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This is about the most fun movie since \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  I haven't read the books although most of my friends my age have, but I must admit I was skeptically about the movie.  My friends that saw it recommended it to me said I would love it, but I still relented.  However, I have recently seen it and WOW!, I was pleasently surprised.  Man, this is a seriously fun and exciting movie.  It's funny and serious and adventurous and that little girl who play Hermione Granger is cute too.  This is a lot of fun and I think everyone should see it.  I look forward to the Chamber of Secrets on November 15th.
B000002LEM|5.0|Needless to say, &quot;Red Rocker&quot; Hagar pulls out all the stops on this one - this is Halen at their hardest, at their absolute finest.  Save for Cherone who steps in later on, there's just nothing better than hearing the piercing wails of Hagar as he tells us like it is, boy!!<br />OU812 features Halen's biggest hits, and MTV rocketed these boys to #1 with a bullet.  I wish they'd consider bringing Hagar back, since they foolishly ousted Cherone.<br />Whatever the case, Diamond Dave will never be back, and that's probably as it should be.<br />PEACE OUT, BROS!!
B000069CWE|1.0|I have some reservations concerning this album.  I have listened to it being a day of release purchaser of it and I am not at all impressed.  First of all, where is the creativity?  We have been waiting for a new studio album from Linkin Park since October of 2000 and this is what we get, a remix album of songs that we already have heard.  I was taken away by the wave of new rock/rap with Hybrid Theory and pulled of the ride with Reanimation.  The album features a plethora of artists in my opinion tearing up Linkin Park songs of old.  The riffs are heavy bass line with a stronger emphasis on rap rather than a emphasis on rock or even a complete mixture.  The album features clips of answering machine messages left on Mike Shinoda's answering machine, for what reason I have yet to conjure up.  I know the difficulties of releasing a sophomore album after great success with a debut including a Grammy.  This album showed lack of creativity, a walk away from the style and arrangements of Hybrid Theory and an attempt to keep the Linkin Park name around while they go into the studio to record what their web-site says are completed tracks.  (I would have rather they waited.)  If this is the new sound of Linkin Park and you were taken by the initial sound of their 2000 debut, please do not waste your money or time with this album.  I sincerely hope that their next studio album (no release date yet) will feature a new array of songs, a better mix of rap and rock instead of favoring one particular side and a return to mainstream music that we have enjoyed with their initial release.
B000002H70|1.0|Disintegration is right...<br />The Cure were best when they did fun pop songs, like in the 80's and early 90's!  Pop songs are what gets played on radio, and the radio is the only sure sign of what's good in music.<br />Obviously this album doesn't get played on the radio.<br />I took a chance with this album, thinking it would feature the \\"fun\\" rock side of Robert Smith.  Alas, it's totally boring rock. I understand that The Cure wanted to try their talented hands at ethereal rock or whatever, but this stuff just drags on and on and on like a movie or something.  Yes, it's very cinematic; cinematic with Smith's mopey vocals, which sound so much better when he's in a good mood.  And why wouldn't the guy be in a good mood?  HE MAKES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS!!  Simply put, this album is too long, too brooding, and too ambitious in scope.<br />For people in college only.<br />TAKE CARE!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|In the age of mainstream boredom such as Creed, Matchbox 20, and Korn. And in the dawn of the nu trend, NU ROCK, such as The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines, and the White Stripes it is refreshing to have a real rock record that means something. We all know how we felt during those bad times almost a year ago and this record hits the mark. Thanks Bruce.

B000067CPX|2.0|The follow up album to Californication  would have been better titled Pussification. I started listening the the RHCP with Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic and fell in love with there hard hitting, funky sound. Californication was a slight departure from this, but I still found myself liking the album. It had a good mix of songs. \\"By the Way\\" has good songs on it however, they are all pretty slow, at least by their standards. One of the best things about the RHCP is Flea's base playing and on this cd he doesn't get a chance to let loose. I don't think they should just keep turning out the same tunes, but why go so soft! In conclusion, it is a good cd but not a very good RHCP cd, if you know what I mean.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is a very talented new artist.  Every single song on this album is great.  I would also highly suggest seeing Mr. Mayer live.  He has great stage presence and sounds even better in person.
B00004RGUU|5.0|I saw this at the show when I was 13.  It was a huge hit, and I can still remember the audience reaction when Newman and Ross took off on the bicycle to &quot;Rain Drops Keep Falling on my Head,&quot; by B.J. Thomas.  Of course the song was a huge hit because the movie was.<br />Newman and Redford had a great chemistry.  They were pals on screen, and became great buddies off screen.  The director originally wanted Steve McQueen for the part of the Sundance Kid, but for reasons I can't recall, he didn't get or take the part.  McQueen would have been a great Sundance, but Redford made it his own and we have this classic to watch over and over again.<br />Parts here and there now date the movie, such as the vocals in the later part when Butch, Sundance and Etta are in Bolivia robbing banks, but the script is timeless, as is the hilarious bickering and banter between Butch and Sundance.<br />Westerns are not my favorite genre, but this is one western I truly love to watch.
B000069HKH|5.0|I always figured that being a Springsteen fan was kind of like being a Dallas Cowboys Fan;  either you are or you aren't, and it can't really be explained.  I, for one, am a longtime Springsteen fan.  When I heard about this new album I approached it cautiously;  I thought to myself, the man is over fifty now, for goodness sake, how much can he possibly have left in the tank?<br />Well, what I got was a pleasant surprise and a CD that I have almost worn out after two days;  'The Rising' is one of Bruce's best albums ever.  It is easily his best studio work in twenty years, leaving the 'Human Touch/Lucky Town' non-E-Street misfire in the dust along with the well-intentioned but waaaay too slow 'Ghost of Tom Joad'.<br />Now, there are some jaded individuals out there who are probably going to give The Boss a hard time about the 9/11 oriented material on the album;  this is the same guy who a couple of years earlier scathed the NYPD with the uber-liberal 'American Skin (41 Shots)', and this album might be misconstrued as a way of trying to capitalize on the tragedies of September 11th.  As a longtime supporter, fan, and admirer, I am not sure how to address that, and I am too humble to try and define 'America's New Attitude' after 9/11.  But I will say this;  the album does make for a well done tribute, and I think we can agree all in all that most of us would rather have Bruce summing it all up than Christina Aguilera or Limpbizkit(!).<br />The majority of the songs do ambiguously (or blatantly, in the case of the bluesy/gospel mix of 'Into the Fire') touch base with issues stemming from 9/11, and it will be interesting to see how the material holds up with time.  The sudden, unexpected loss of a loved one is a recurring theme throughout the album.  Humble, 'out of nowhere' heroism is sung about first-hand on the mellow, keyboard driven 'Nothing Man', which sounds like it could have been recorded during the 'Born in the U.S.A' Sessions and is one of the best songs on the album.<br />Bruce does mix in some fun on this album;  'Waiting on a Sunny Day' is a melancholy, light, fluffy, radio friendly tune that reminds me a little bit of 'Hungry Heart'.  'Mary's Place' could have come right off of 'The River' and it evokes a joyful, concert-ready reaction similar to 'Rosalita'.<br />Regarding Bruce being over 50 and wondering 'how much he had left';  obviously, no one has told BRUCE how old he is getting!  Half of the songs on the album are cranked out and rock as hard as anything Bruce has ever done.  The catchy title song has plenty of heart behind it and probably will wind up being the song off of the album that gets the most radio play.  The dark 'Further On (Up The Road)' is as energetic as anything off of 'The River' or 'Born in the USA'.  'Worlds Apart' jams after a funky, slow extended opening.  'Countin' on A Miracle' might just be the best straight rock tune The Boss has ever done;  it stands out in the middle of the album and for an Old School Bruce Fan, this itself is worth the price of the disc.<br />Everything does not click perfectly.  'Empty Sky' and 'The Fuse' did not leave much of an impression on me other than being somewhat droning.  'My City of Ruins' (supposedly written prior to September 11th) has a good sound but is confused as to whether it is upbeat or a downer, and somewhere in the middle it just sounds a little whiny.  'You're Missing' is the slowest, sappiest song on the album.  And 'Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)' is an annoyingly positive little thing that is easily my least favorite song on the album;  it should have been left off in my opinion.<br />On the flipside, there is 'Paradise', which is the second to last song on the album.  You have probably already heard about this song;  it is about a Suicide Bomber in a Middle Eastern country.  I know, it sounds kind of stupid.  Then I listened to it.  The song is very low-key with cautious, muted keyboard work, and it's first verse sent chills up and down my spine.  'Paradise'  might be the most haunting, eeriely beautiful song Bruce has ever done in terms of both music/sound  and lyrics (and hopefully, fans realize that this is saying something!).  If 'The Rising' is remembered (as it probably should be) for Album of the Year consideration come Grammy-Time, 'Paradise' is the song that will lead to Bruce winning the award.<br />All in all, an excellent album - 4 and a half stars to five stars.  The handful of throwaway songs are more than made up for by several outstanding songs that are as good as anything Springsteen has ever done - maybe better than anything he has ever done.<br />Way to go, Bruce.  Now, don't go getting old on us anytime soon!first verse sent chills up and down my spine.

B00001OH7U|5.0|I am a former fan who gradually lost interest in David Bowie's theatricallity, and more recently his nice-guy modesty, all of which feel a bit forced to me. <br />But listening to Station to Station remains both an interesting and emotional experience after all this time. This lp makes my neck hairs stand up on end.
0316666343|5.0|I remember the first time I read \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", and felt that, somehow, this was a special work and would be around literary circles for a long time. Now it's a modern American classic, and I felt the same way when I read this book. It's simply a wonderful story to read, and I feel that it is destined to be shortlisted for the Pulitzer in Fiction. The writing and character development are first rate, and the plot moves you along at a perfect pace. At times you cry, at times you laugh, and at times you do both together. Even though the underlying action that propels the book is a horrible crime, it's pushed into the background, as it were, to get to the unintended consequences of the murder, not only on the victim, but on her family and friends. Maybe I'm just an optimist, but I truly wish the author's idea of heaven were actuality. Read this book, you won't ever regret it!
B000069HKH|4.0|Bruce Springsteen may be a rocker down to his boot heels but in my mind he's a folk singer.  He's the journal keeper for those who haven't been taking notes or paying attention.  Which may explain his overflowing fan base.  When someone takes time out of living their life to listen to \\"Thunder Road\\" or \\"Glory Days\\" or \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" the listener will likely react with, \\"Damn.  How did he know?\\"  <br /> &quot;The Rising&quot; is our journal's most anticipated entry because even eleven months after September 11th, how many of us still haven't defined what that day did to us?  I guess I expected Bruce to sort through my feelings, arrange them in order of importance and hold them up for me to look at.  He did...sort of.<br />     Rather than providing a cathartic experience though, Springsteen has dipped his lyric pen into the whole pond of 9/11 without stirring too much or diving to the bottom.  He shows a great restraint that I fear is borne of respect.  Respect for those who lost a life partner.  Respect for emergency workers who witnessed horrors we'll never comprehend. Respect for a city with a hole blown through the middle of it.  Bruce sacrificed release for respect and I would much rather forgive him that transgression than for holding back. There is much to appreciate about \\"The Rising\\" but more than anything I just wanted Springsteen to let `er rip.  Just one song of wailing would have done me a world of good in a world of hurt.<br />     The lyrics throughout the album are precise and carefully considered but what's lacking is a gut punch image: the musical riff or few words that stop us dead in our tracks and make us say, \\"Damn. How did he know?\\" <br />     For me, the song that comes closest is \\"Nothing Man.\\"  It reached that place in me that is still grieving.  It's a song about a hero who lost himself when he lost his city on 9/11.  It is incredibly mournful and meaningful and gives a voice to those who did the job of heroes and can find no solace despite their sacrifice.<br />     What happened on September 11th happened to all of us.  I may not have been physically bloodied but my spirit took a hit.   I suspect Bruce Springsteen was wounded as well.  My hope is that when I see him in concert on August 30th in St. Louis, he shakes off the constraints of respectful distance and lets loose with his full voice.  I think he will.  I have no reason to expect otherwise.
B000062XM3|1.0|\\"Fight Club\\" tries to be provocative and oh-so-hip, but it's essentially an ugly, mean-spirited -- and worse yet, *pointless* -- tantrum.<br />You can't help despising every one of the characters.  Ed Norton plays a weak, neurotic nonentity.  Helena Bonham Carter plays a thoroughly unpleasant lowlife -- the sort of woman who wouldn't care if she were wearing underwear even if she were hit by the proverbial bus (which, by the time she'd been in the movie ten minutes, I was devoutly hoping for).  Brad Pitt (whose character \\"Tyler\\" inspired similar bus longings) plays an insufferable overaged brat.  He's a smug, know-it-all windbag who spouts preachy anti-materialistic rants -- while wearing expensive trendy clothes -- but in garish colors, so we know that he's a \\"nonconformist\\".  Luckily for Tyler, his physical attractiveness lends a specious credibility to his lectures, because their content was simplistic and hackneyed -- we've all heard it many times before, done better.  If they'd cast, say, Dennis Franz in that part, the tirades would have had the underwhelming effect that they actually merited.<br />The movie begins with the content and theme of a fair-to-middling \\"Dilbert\\" comic strip -- suburban white guys whining about how they can no longer assume as a given a life of effortless wealth, privilege, and power.  Their jobs are dull and don't offer intellectual challenge, spiritual fulfillment, or satisfaction.  In other words, because of evil corporations...  or having been raised by single mothers...  (or something)...  they've been cheated out of what they'd considered their rightful due, and are now stuck with the same problems that everyone thinks normal when faced by women, African-Americans, and the working class.<br />For some reason -- possibly because the filmmakers quite correctly surmised that a movie consisting entirely of anti-corporate sermons wouldn't sell very many tickets -- Tyler's solution is to reclaim their masculinity...  or overthrow thecorporate hierarchy...  (or something)...  by picking fistfights and blowing stuff up.  This becomes popular with other suburban white guys with way too much time on their hands, who decide that they're all victims, too, and that they all want to pick fights and blow stuff up, too.<br />This spirals out of control, Sorcerer's-Apprentice-like, and (d)evolves into a dystopian cult/army of suburban white guys; complete with rules, chants, and rituals (see what I mean about these people having way too much time on their hands?); every bit as dehumanizing as their jobs.  The members of \\"Fight Club\\" start as sheep-like drones mindlessly obeying corporate bosses, and end as sheep-like drones mindlessly obeying rabid-dog sociopath Tyler.  The movie has the nerve to try to pass this off as rebellion...  or asserting their individuality...  (or something).<br />Granted, the movie is well made, well acted, and visually interesting.  Granted, it makes points -- about the amorality of megacorporations and the inadequacy of consumer capitalism as a substitute for independence, worthwhile work, and fulfillment -- which are valid, and might even have been thought-provoking, had they not been delivered in such a God-awful heavy-handed fashion.  Anyone intelligent enough to contemplate such issues doesn't need them pounded home with a sledgehammer.<br />But a competent presentation of a ridiculous, muddled premise (\\"Single mothers\\"?  Who is this -- Dan Quayle?) is worse than an incompetent one, because it's harder to dismiss.  The filmmakers attempt to disguise/justify/redeem the movie's hateful, no-win false dichotomy (one can escape being a victim only by victimizing others) with trite thematic content (materialism bad), but all that does is make it prissy and hypocritical as well as thuggish -- like putting a doily over a Sherman tank.<br />The movie has no African-American, Hispanic, or blue-collar characters, although those groups face at least as many difficulties and injustices as the middle-class office workers depicted.  The lone woman character is physically and personally repellent -- worse, her only purpose is as a spittoon for the men.  So if I understand correctly:  The movie has no blacks, no Hispanics, no working-class people, only one woman (who's a caricature, and loathsome as well), and crypto-Nazis (Tyler actually confesses he renders soap from human flesh -- but it comes from fat people, so that's supposed to be hilarious and cool -- apparently he's not quite subversive enough to deconstruct mainstream esthetics), setting bombs and beating people up as a solution to depersonalization...  but it *does* rag on Ikea.  REAL progressive!<br />Get a clue, fellas.  If your self-worth and autonomy depend on a \\"masculinity\\" defined as brutality, a dull job is the least of your problems.  It's supposed to be shocking news that jobs are unrewarding sometimes?  Companies are in business to make money -- period -- and *nobody's* life is fun every minute of every day.  Imbuing your life with meaning is *your* responsibility, not your employer's.  If you're bored or unfulfilled -- paint a picture, climb a mountain, volunteer at the homeless shelter -- do whatever matters to *you*.  If you hate Ikea -- don't buy their stuff.  If you hate consumerism -- throw your cellphone in the trash and wear your 1980s-vintage stonewashed jeans until they fall apart.  Or wouldn't that be trendy enough?<br />Testosterone run amuck and mindless nihilism have cathartic appeal to angry, frustrated adolescent boys of all ages, but they don't make for a good story, nor interesting filmmaking.  Despite pretending to be a Deep Meaningful Parable...  (or something), \\"Fight Club\\" is still very obviously a movie about picking fistfights and blowing stuff up, and not much more.  Presenting bombings and beatings as self-empowerment is reprehensible enough without also insulting the viewer's intelligence with a smokescreen of \\"moral\\" posturing -- to say nothing of the infuriatingly condescending assumption that those who disagree \\"just don't get it\\".<br />Even Brad Pitt with his shirt off can't make this movie watchable -- and I am a person who likes looking at Brad Pitt with his shirt off.  Unless you prefer your dimwitted violence with a side order of sanctimonious rhetoric, skip this movie and watch \\"Beavis and Butthead\\" -- at least they're funny.

0790736039|1.0|This movie is so far off from the book its not even funny!! Pennywise's suit is wrong, they added stuff in, took stuff out, put the events in the wrong order and in the wrong settings, etc. The acting is horrible (except for tim curry) so all in all, its just BAD! B-A-D! I absolutely loved the book and was looking forward to seeing this movie, and I was pretty [darned] dissapointed! Stay away from this movie at all costs and just read the book.
079073382X|5.0|I once shared this movie with several friends - to my amazement they didn't care for it.  Their criticism was misguided, and amounted to something about how they disagreed with some of the philosophical points made in the dialogue, and that they weren't impressed with the youthful conversation.  I don't know how one can miss the point of this movie so badly.  It functions on many levels, but one way to describe it in a few words is that it depicts what it means to be young (I am in my mid 40's).  You really have to have a tin ear and a tin heart to not be moved emotionally by this movie.  It's really great to read all the positive reviews. It is the only movie I have ever purchased.<br />Again, it is beautiful on many levels and filled with great scenes and music, but let me say that the ending is the most visually and emotionally moving ending to a movie I have ever seen.  I'm referring to the scene where the camera revisits at sunrise the places the 2 characters have been during the night.  Like all art, one can't really describe it, but it depicts and underscores loneliness, the human soul, and how relationships and the &quot;in between&quot; give meaning to our lives.

B00005JKNF|5.0|The only way to appreciate this movie is to see it several times. When I first saw Gosford Park, I liked it in a general way but I left the theatre confused. Apart from the magnificent performances by Maggie Smith (who is a national treasure)and Helen Mirren (who just gets better and better) I had a hard time following all that was going on. Look, there's the once beautiful Alan Bates. Oh, there's Derek Jacobi; why is his part so small? Wait a minute, isn't that Charles Dance from &quot;A Jewel in the Crown?&quot; Clive Owens? Didn't he play the ape child of Charles Dance in some Masterpiece Theatre years ago? My oh my isn't that Jeremy Northam charming? It was one dizzying moment of recognition after another and not much more. Thanks to Julian Fellowes narration in the DVD, now I get it. It's a rich tapestry of a way of life to which all of us might aspire except it's gone for good and good riddance!

B000059WOD|5.0|Although I don't own this specific CD, I have heard the 2 additional tracks that it offers. After hearing those songs all I have to say is, wow! This is one of the best CDs I have ever purchased. You can listen to it over and over again and never get sick of it. With the smooth lyrics of Mike Shinoda and the screaming, yet strangely calm voice of Chester Bennington, everyone will be satisfied. Their combination of hip-hop, rock and electronica help to give the CD a great balance of form and function which will keep you hooked for hours on end. <br />I must say that &quot;My December&quot; and &quot;In The End&quot; are my favorite songs. &quot;My December&quot; steps away from the hardcore rock sound and adds that soothing, kick-back tone that will relax you yet also force you to put your CD player on repeat. One of my other favorite tracks is &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot;, a song that any true hip-hop/turntablist fan will love. And for anyone that doesn't understand the name of the song, think about...how do you cure and itch? Scratch it, which is exactly what this track is, scratching!<br />If you haven't purchased this CD yet, do so, or if you already own Hybrid Theory and are merely looking for the 2 bonus tracks then you can purchase the &quot;One Step Closer&quot; single. Either way, pick up one of the two discs, you won't regret it!
B000006045|5.0|Mezzanine was fixed, almost permanently in my car for two years. Now, it shares space with Morcheeba and Hooverphonic and Portishead, who also enjoyed semi-permanent status. Thing with Mezzanine is, there are so many levels of sound that every time you listen to it, you hear something new. That in itself is a wonder, but the vocals are simply gorgeous, the beats are hypnotic...bone conductive...and the lyrics are completely incomprehensible. With this album, it's all in the sound, which just wraps you up and takes you away. Massive Attack is a an eclectic mix of genres: jazz, pop, folk, rap, blues, even classical. They take what they need from each and create their own, unique sound. One of the best things about this album is the unique style of each cut: different vocalists, different styles, totally different sounds, but all absolutely Massive. I could not rate this album higher. I'm not a kid, I'm well past the half-century mark but always searching for really good new music and Mezzanine delivers in spades. The very first song on the album, Angel, has been in five films that I know of, including The Matrix! Why these movie guys never got past the first song is anybody's guess, but the rest of the album is just as good as the beginning. It just keeps getting better. I know Massive has a new album coming out and I'm almost afraid to hear it; equalling Mezzanine would be an amazing feat, but to best it seems impossible. Mezzanine just may be my favourite album of all time, ever, but be warned: you need a very good sound system to hear it all. There is nothing simple here.
B000069HKH|5.0|...by the fact that, as a longtime fan going back to '72 and Greetings, I am so loving the atypical Bruce tracks on this disc...&quot;You're Missing&quot;, &quot;The Fuse&quot; and &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; have proven to be my favorite. The band is still tight, Soozie Tyrell's strings add the right amount of haunting emotion, the lyrics are just as moving on print as is sung, Bruce's guitar cuts deep and his vocals, esp on Missing and Paradise, are in top form.  This will prove to be an important musical work, not just for it's content, but for its artistic achievement.
B000069HKH|5.0|It is hard to give an objective review when you are a die-hard fan, but I'll try.<br />I don't know what the person who gave The Rising one star was thinking. He described the songs as whiny. It is true that this CD has some gloomy songs, but what else do you expect? a party album? hip-hop from the Boss?<br />Even before it was released it was very well known what the CD would be about. Besides, looking at the Boss' back catalogue, Nebraska is hardly a \\"happy\\" album.<br />Focusing on the music though, I think the Boss and the E-Street Band have not missed a beat since \\"Born in The USA\\". In fact, I think they sound better than ever.<br />The album has a nice balance between slow and rockin' songs, best exemplified in songs like City of Ruins and Further On Up The Road.<br />He's not telling you how to feel, but rather how he feels about what's been going on in the US lately. Besides, he talked to relatives of 9-11 victims. He did his research. Kudos to the Boss and the E-guys (and girl) for another great album. Welcome Back!
0684874350|1.0|I don't know why everyone likes this book so much, I find it very boring, dull, never goes anywhere. It's about as much fun as molasses. In fact I would rather rip out my colon and skip rope with it then read another word. :-)
6303122647|5.0|Truly one of a kind.  Tim Burton's best (brilliant) work.  Delightful accompanying music score by Danny Elfman.
B000069CWE|1.0|This band just might as well go completely rap. There are bands out there that I thought were the most rap-influenced rap metal out there like Crazy Town and (old) Primer 55 but neither of them made an almost all rap remake of their old album. This band, first of all, must be completely incapable of writing new songs because they've been living off of Hybrid Theory for the past 3 years now and instead of releasing a new CD they re-mix their old album as if it wasn't bad enough already. If you like rap or techno, only then would I recommend this CD to anyone.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is as good as it gets.  If you are a Python fan, watch out, you may wind up wetting the couch.
0783208227|5.0|This film is not for everyone, 'cause people are afraid to smile today. This story casts cynicism aside, but it takes a bit of patience to follow. Downey is the only cynic in the film (at the beginning), but after his special encounters with four 'heavenly' strangers, his life and our outlooks are changed a bit- maybe forever. That's the beauty of this movie. It is handled with deft comedy (Downey's physical comedy as the result of souls invading his body is on a par with Chaplin and Keaton), but it is also one of the most loving stories, with truly loving characters, I've ever seen. The four vignettes with Sizemore, Grodin, Woodard, and Sedgewick are quite nice- and for me, the final two with Sedgewick and Woodard are bewitching. This film will make you shed a tear or two (if not downright bawl), but you'll be smiling- and that's no matter how many times you watch. So watch, hokay?!!
B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park is everything they say they are, they are neither rock nor rap, its a hybrid theory that people still do not understand. If you are into strickly hard core rock or rock then I seriously think you should reconsider this album, if you are open to various sounds, riffs and samples then this is the album for you. The boys at Linkin park did a great job with their first album and on this one, they created a true hybrid theory,,,<br />Good going guys.
B000060OFT|4.0|Ok, so here's the deal... When this movie first came out I was about 15 years old, and what blew me away was the number of my friends that went out and saw this- and actually enjoyed it! Sure they probably only went to see Leo, but when it comes down to it, a bunch of Gen X teenagers were voluntarily going out to see Shakespeare and not just liking what they saw, but understanding what they saw. <BR>I love almost anything Baz Luhrmann does and this was no exception (almost). Yeah, if you're older that 15 it can be pretty tough to stomach Leo and Claire. But the way I look at it, anything that helps a larger (and younger!) audience to appreciate The Bard is OK with me. I plan to teach English when I've finished my degree, I can tell you that this film will make a great stepping stone to Branagh's 4hr Hamlet.<BR>So the dilemma- great film, terrible actors- what do you do?
B000069HKH|5.0|An excellent CD.  I wasn't prepared to be so moved by the words and music from this CD.  I bought it because it was Bruce and the E Street Band.<BR>Great lyrics - most with a definite message of hope and the power of the human spirit to survive what seems beyond endurance and to in fact - rise up.<BR>The music rocks like Bruce and the E Street of old.
B0000640SA|4.0|This movie will keep you guessing all the way through.  And if you don't watch it several times, you will miss out.  Enjoy...it's a brain twister.
B00005R87Q|2.0|The movie was good and the cars were [bad]. Wait, I got that backward. The movie was bad and the cars were sweet. The acting is aweful. Seriously, the only reason why I bought it is for the cars. I even ripped it to vcd and deleted all the \\"acting\\" I parts so all I had was the racing. It makes a great movie.
014028009X|5.0|Bridget sounds like every woman's nightmare.  She's a seemingly shallow, insecure, ego-centric, delusional, semi-feminist, weight-obsessed, cigarette-and-alcohol-addicted, boyfriend-hungry \\"singleton\\" surrounded by \\"smug marrieds\\" and her garish mother - at least in her diary, where all her flaws get to come out.  All in all, a pretty normal woman.  The nightmare part is that it's constantly (and publicly) found out that she's not the superwoman/goddess that modern society seems to expect.<br />But that's alright.  She's also beguilingly charming, warm-hearted, witty (after disaster occurs, of course), and keenly observant when you least expect it.  All the wrong funny things lead to all the right funny things.  Follows Pride and Prejudice much closer than you would believe (try reading them in succession/concurrently), this is an inspired re-writing of Jane Austen's classic.  A fresh voice in an timeless situation of woman v. the world.  Guess who wins?<br />So, it's a bit predictable, but that doesn't take away from Bridget's charisma.  She's wonderfully, deleriously human.  An overdose of self-help books has her aiming for high, vague ideals like Inner Poise.  Her friends, having read different self-help books, aren't much help, but a crazy continuation of Bridget's frazzled, endearing self.<br />The movie captures Bridget's screwball comic essence (as well as Daniel Cleaver's caddishness) brilliantly, but the rest didn't do justice to her friends or mother.  A great read at any time, it will go all too quickly.  V. v. good.
B00005OWEG|4.0|I have been a movie enthusiast all my life, but when i saw this movie (on its original release) I was blown away.<BR>I could not believe that sound, image and story could be mixed in such a magnificent way... The movie was a trip for me.<BR>Years latter comes the Redux... Apocalypse is still as powerful as ever but some of the added scenes break the frenetic rythm of the original.<BR>Some of the scenes help us to see Captian Willard as the auto-destructive S.O.B. is only hinted in the original, but others not only break with his image, but also put the character out of context.<BR>I would have loved to give this one a 5 stars review.
0375751513|4.0|What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart?  This story gets to the bottom of that question and takes you on a journey ending with a surprise.  Dorian Gray is the perfect main character.  You will love him, dislike him, loathe him and then pity him.  Just as relevant 100 years after it was penned.
B00005LB9O|4.0|I love this cd.  It has a song to fit every mood your in.  Happy listen to Sing.  Mad listen to Last train.  Need to be lifted up listen to Safe.  This is the must have cd for car trips.  If you want something not to rocked out but not to soft sort of a Counting Crows but a little bit deeper buy this cd. Don't listen to any one who dissed it they are just haters.  This is one cd you won't be using as a coaster
0060090367|4.0|&quot;Watermelon&quot; by Marion Keyes is a most entertaining story.  A sad (but also at times) funny tale dealing with the frustrations of life and love.<br />The characters are easy to connect with, the dialogue moves right along and the plot as I said before is most entertaining.<br />A wonderful effort on the part of the writer!<br />John Savoy<BR>Savoy International<BR>Motion Pictures Inc.
6304383177|5.0|They say It Happened One Night is the quintessential screwball, but I have to disagree, much as I love that movie.  Hepburn and Grant are Colbert and Gable (the couple in IHON) on speed.  A movie that's funny without trying, it defies logic while engaging your mind.  Almost every line is a gem - brilliantly witty.  Hepburn is sincere, though feather-brained, and Grant is all but hopping with exasperation and attraction.  The chemistry sparkles.<br />Grant's awkward, shy David Huxley is bewildered and helpless when faced with the human whirlwind that is Hepburn's Susan Vance.  She knows what she wants and she wants David.  Poor David - he and his dinosaur don't stand a chance.  You know he's stuck when he's missing his glasses, his clothes, and his fossil.<br />Both befuddled, patient David and speedtalking, enthusiastic Susan are not the type of characters you expect these distinguished actors to play.  Here Grant is unlike his general image as the experienced, classy man about town.  Instead, his is a man whose world is hilariously turned upside-down by the women in his life (see also Arsenic and Old Lace, Holiday, The Philadelphia Story).  Hepburn is chirpy and ditzy (but not stupid as we see later), but lovable and oh so maddening.  The whole film is a breath of fresh air, while being stylish and intelligent.<br />I don't think I need to tell you that any story that involves:<BR>a leopard (or two?)<BR>mixed-up identities (and golf balls and cars)<BR>a million dollar giveaway<BR>a brontosaurus' collarbone, and <BR>a dog named George<BR>will be simple or calm.  If you can't suspend disbelief for two hours, this is not for you.  But if you enjoy rapid-fire, whip-smart dialogue, madcap antics, slapsticky action, and a touch of romance, this will be perfect.<br />I love this movie so much, I have two copies on tape since it's not yet on DVD.  A great pick-me-up when you need something bright and energizing.
6301095294|4.0|\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" all starts when \\"a man buys a ticket\\". That man happens to be Richard Starkey who is taking his Aunt Jessie on a trip. And what a trip it is! I have to say most of this film is great. I particularly love the spaghetti scene, (this is an actual dream John Lennon had). He is a waiter serving quite nasty looking spaghetti with a shovel to Aunt Jessie. The parts with the magicians are great as well.  The music is wonderful, including spectacular performances of \\"I am the Walrus\\" \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" and \\"Blue Jay Way\\". This might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it does feature some great scenes that you definately don't want to miss. (P.S. And don't forget to watch for John as the ticket salesman when Ringo buys a ticket and notice how George only has about three lines total in the whole show!)
B00005QY5Y|3.0|What a disappointment!  A thoroughly average album with few memorable moments.  The one word that best describes this album -- soulless.  This album sounds decent enough, but it didn't make me feel a thing.  Maybe I am just missing the boat.  Plus, a lot of the songs are so soft (I swear they could easily have been on a Celine Dion record), leaving the realm of alt-country way behind, skipping right over pop, and landing squarely in schmaltz territory.  If you want to hear Ryan Adam's best stuff, pick up Whiskeytown's &quot;Stranger's Almanac&quot; instead, a truly great album.
B00000IQW0|4.0|I have read many reviews of the videos and DVD regarding this movie and all are in error as thay have said that this release is the pilot episode for the series. Sadly, it is not. Nor is it a combined version of the pilot and the 4th episode.  It is merely the pilot episode minus about 14 minutes(I have compared it to my old recording of the pilot) and some of the sequences are edited differently. However, it is still great in this form, Dolby Digital Mono is ok but it sounds better in Pro-Logic surround. The trailer would have been a nice bonus feature. But it wasn't apparently available, perhaps a Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS Special edition will be released with the trailer included to make us DVD collector's happy. I have heard rumors that maybe the entire series, incl. the pilot, will be released on DVD soon.
0060977493|2.0|I will say one thing--Roy certainly has a knack for lovely description and painting a scene. I found this intriguing when I first started reading the book, but less than half-way through, I felt like I was completely bogged down with descriptions of irrelevant scenery. Not only that, but I felt that Roy had expended most of her energies painting scenery and little energy creating characters that I could identify with. Furthermore, Roy bombards the reader with pages and pages of summary and back story that would have been more effective if told in scene form. The story jumps around in time, making it confusing at times, but that wasn't a huge problem. Overall, I did not feel I really knew any of the characters well enough to connect with them, nor did I feel that there was any real driving force that moved the story forward. Roy touches on some interesting social and political issures, but I feel that these could have been incorporated into a better-told story with characters that weren't so flat.
630382336X|5.0|A Hard Days Night is full of humor, fun and of course many great Beatles songs including &quot;If I Fell&quot; &quot;I Shoulda Known Better&quot; and the title track &quot;A Hard Days Night&quot;. I have seen all of the Beatles films, but this one has to be my favorite and it is the first Beatles film I ever saw. I have to admit the first time you watch it, if you aren't used to Liverpudlian accents, it is a little hard to understand what is being said. But once you've watched it a couple hundred of times, you get used to it. This movie is packed full of jokes, you just have to listen for them. The basic story of &quot;A Hard Days Night&quot; is that John, Paul, George,and Ringo are traveling to a film studio for a television appearance, which is seen at the end of the movie (see if you can find Phil Collins in the crowd). Along with them is Paul's grandfather, referred to by everyone as &quot;very clean&quot;, even though he is very mischievious. Paul's grandfather talks to Ringo during the film, which makes Ringo leave the band to go on his own. This is one of the best scenes in the movie, showing Ringo looking lonely and dejected as he walks the streets, eventually getting arrested(Don't worry, he is rescued). I also enjoy when George accidentally ends up at an audition for a teen tv show. I would tell a lot more about the movie, but I think you should get the movie and see it for yourself. You can watch it anytime and it is great for kids as well. And believe me, I wouldn't be giving &quot;A Hard Days Night&quot; a five star rating if it didn't deserve it. :)
B000069HKH|5.0|Great album, couldn't think of a better person to put words to the 9/11 tragedy then the Boss, and he doesn't disappoint. Up there with Born To Run as among his finest. The high points far outnumber the low; Bruce is at his best when he writes from the heart, not as good when he sounds like he's trying too hard to write a hit (out of the 15 songs on this album, to my ears, only 2-3 don't measure up to the rest of the album).Too many high points to mention, and some of the best writing of his career. Stunning.
6301963717|5.0|This is an ultimate CLASSIC mobster-type movie. Great performances by the always-amazing Gabriel Byrne, John Tutoro and Marcia Gay Harden. This movie was robbed of mainstream success back in 1990, but for those of us who have seen it, i think i speak for everyone when i say that it is an overall brilliant movie. Great script, great cast, great director.
0066620996|5.0|I really enjoyed this audio book.  I could not stop listening to it.  While it was focused on companies that were probably turnaround good company poised for greatness, the steps were an affirmation of what I am doing now and I found it very entertaining, comforting and well researched.  I enjoyed it.
B00000JR2A|5.0|The Big Chair LP is one of the 80s best albums but that album is nothing compared to this album which I can easily say is their most creative album to date. Sowing The Seeds Of Love was a worthy single that got the recognition that it deserved by making it to number 2 on the charts. It's unfortunate that the making of this album would tear apart TFF. Elemental was a step down from this album. My favorite track is the haunting Standing On The Corner Of The Third World. I just love how it blasts into a Gospel-like song. The bonus tracks are great as well and actually work well with the original tracks. Go out and buy this CD.
B000006045|5.0|Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said.
B00005JK1C|5.0|The Usual Suspects is an amazing, action-packed psychological drama/thriller type movie that will definately leave you guessing till the end! Amazing direction by Bryan Singer, great script with an OUTSTANDING ensemble cast including the amazingly talented Gabriel Byrne (the sexiest man alive), the brilliant Kevin Spacey and Kevin Pollack, possibly the most hilarious man alive. The DVD offers great features such as a number of cast and crew interviews, featurettes, and a gag roll, and lots of behind the scenes footage and deleted scenes. Not too mention, i find that the visuals of the DVD are FAR better than any VHS, it's a lot brighter and easier to see everything. All in all, this is a great, great cult classic for any movie freak. If you haven't seen this, you aren't a movie fanatic!!!
B000055Y0X|5.0|This movie has two levels.  On one, it is the kind of movie that is so funny that dead men would laugh.  Though I had seen it before, my neighbors must have concluded I was nuts because I burst out laughing while returning from emptying the garbage.  Thinking of the scene in which Dr. Strangelove tries to suppress a salute is that funny. In his own, usually quiet way, Peter Sellers surely was one of the funniest men ever to live.<br />On the other level, the film is what Kubrick started with the intention of making.  The project started with the intention of making a very serious and alrming statment about the threat of nuclear war.  The movie was released at the Cold War when the omnipresent threat of total annihilation hanging like smog over everything we did.  That this movie is able to make serious, effecting statements about this era through a comedy is surprising, yet arguably the movie is so effective only because its conclusions are premised on a comedy that has Kubrick's trademark, brisk pacing.<br />This is a marvelous movie that has a deservedly high ranking on the AFI's list of both great films and great comedies.  Unfortunately, this is not the best presentation I can imagine.  Amoing other flaws, the film is in full screen rather than widescreen format.<br />I would love to see a better edition of this film released.  However, I don't regret the purchase for a moment.  This is a must have for my library.
B000069HKH|5.0|This isn't Springsteen's best album musically or lyrically - it lacks the depth and storytelling complexity of Nebraska or Tom Joad, the epic scope of Born to Run, and the raw emotion of Darkness on the Edge of Town.  It isn't his worst either: that is reserved for his bland pop trilogy of Tunnel of Love, Human Touch, and Lucky Town.  Running 75 minutes, with fifteen songs with the theme of September 11, I feel that it would have been stronger if he left out a couple of weak tunes. <br />But those things are details.  The virtues of this album don't lie merely in the music, but in the themes and its context.  This will probably be the album Springsteen may be most remembered for - and perhaps rightfully so.<br />It IS close to being his most enjoyable album - the sound is halfway between the r&amp;b influences of The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle and the somewhat repetitive (but catchy) anthems of Born in the USA.  Springsteen is breaking no new musical ground, and for the most part the style and production could have been churned out back in 1978 (there is a short incorporation of world music influence, but certainly no nod to electronica or rap or grunge).   What he and the band attempt, however, they accomplish masterfully.  <br />I was fearful that the album was merely cynical marketing exploitation of a tragedy.  Unfortunately, with the hype surrounding it, and the unthinking way I'm sure many will embrace it, Bruce and be an overappreciated and oversimplified icon once again for a time.  But that isn't fair - the songs are not jingoistic, simplistic, or overly sentimental.  They are unrelenting in their message that people of all countries must band together to overcome hatred and tragedy.  Some songs, such as &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; are sublime.  Some, like &quot;Mary's Place&quot; and &quot;Countin on a Miracle&quot; are catchy, rolicking classic Sprinsteen.  Some, like &quot;The Rising&quot; are uplifting anthems.The solid songs far outweigh the few missteps.<br />I don't think that any other artist could pull off a full album of songs about 9-11.  The events of that day touched most of us profoundly, and there are many moments on this album that take me straight back to those early moments, when I saw the first pictures of the towers on television.  For that reason these songs will be woven into the fabric of my memory and they will be woven into the collective memory of our culture, along with the images and stories we shared.  In that, this album is a grand ambition realized for Springsteen once again, and another shining moment in a great career.  Buy it.
B00005Y23E|5.0|After being in the Caribbean a few times and getting a basic overload of reggae, junkanoo, and soca - I can still pop this CD in and be in awe.  It really is that good.
B000069HJI|4.0|After this album, co-lead vocalist &amp; songwriter Roger Hodgson left the band and Supertramp went on for at least 3 more albums without him, though they'd lost the magic Roger brought to the mix. The songwriting and the vocals are split almost equally between Hodgson and Rick Davies on this one and they play off each other well. Beautifully produced, with some masterful 12 and 16 string guitar playing by Hodgson that simply shimmers. <BR>A must for Supertramp fans and not a bad introduction for anyone not familiar with their tuneful, often miscategorized sound.
B00005QIPH|1.0|Everyone here says that &quot;it doesn't matter if you're original&quot; and &quot;who cares if you can't play instruments?&quot; If you go by those criteria, then any old garage band with anything resembling an instrument and a &quot;voice&quot; could achieve fame and fortune...haha it's not that simple!<br />Everything on &quot;Is This It&quot; has been heard before--the tired three-chord guitars, the stop-start drums, and the garbled vocals, all of them have been done before by bands such as The Clash, Television, and The Velvet Underground (and done MUCH better, I should say).  However, the similarities between the pretenders (i.e., The Strokes) and the contenders (i.e., the other bands) stop there.  <br />The Strokes have no original leanings whatsoever and are basically a cover band of the classic New York punk scene.  If one were to look at the classic albums throughout history, he would find that all of them has their own unique and distinctive sounds--just look at &quot;The White Album,&quot; &quot;Born To Run,&quot; &quot;Nevermind,&quot; &quot;Automatic For The People,&quot; and &quot;OK Computer.&quot; &quot;Is This It&quot; cannot be distinguished from the endless stacks of garage-punk records done before, and will most definitely not be remembered 20 years from now.<br />If a band possesses no originality and no instrumental precision, then what does it have?  Looks?  Leather coats? It seems that in today's music world, the latter two are the only qualifications one needs to be a &quot;talented musician.&quot; And furthermore, if The Strokes and their fellow garage-imitators (The Vines...don't even get me started) are leading some type of &quot;revolution&quot; that is changing the musical landscape, then why are their record sales so dismal?  Why are they adored by only a select audience? Though record sales aren't the end-all-be-all indicator of a band's talent, they indicate very well the effect that a band is having on the pop scene and the extentto which it is shaping certain changes in style.  For example, Eminem sold more records in one week that The Strokes, The Vines, The Hives, and The White Stripes have combined since each of their respective albums has come out!<br />Guess even rappers can be original and instrumentally powerful...sigh...
B00005JY1B|5.0|I love this movie.  I'm a sucker for romantic men, and Keanu<BR>has that special sexy/sweet combination down pat.  If I were<BR>to name the top ten 'hankie flics', this one would be #1, above<BR>Cary & Deborah, and Tom and Meg.  Why? Because of the vulnerability that both Nelson and Sarah show, as well as, their<BR>chemistry on screen.  Critics who cite the unbelievability of<BR>the premise should remember that this is a movie, not real life.<BR>I would recommend this to everyone, but especially gals who<br />needs a dose of a man who 'treats a woman right'.  Bonus is the<BR>great moments Nelson has with Abner. See it!  Buy it! You won't<BR>be disappointed.
B00005J73X|5.0|Bon Jovi's live album &quot;One Wild Night Live&quot; really captured the essence that is the band, thier live performances. If anyone has ever been to a Jovi show, they know what I am talking about. Whenever I pop in this cd, I feel I am jammin' to the music in one of their sold out concerts. There are many great tracks, from Livin' On A Prayer to their new single It's My Life, and many from in between. And who could forget the Bon Jovi National Anthem : Wanted Dead Of Alive! Anyone that is a Bon Jovi fan should really pick up this album to add to thier collection. Or if you know someone who is a fan, get the cd and listen to it to understand what the fuss is really all about.
B00000AD94|5.0|Okay, I'm a Beard obsessive, tracking down live and obscure albums, singles, etc., but IMHO, this, their debut studio album, is still the best. The two long tracks, The Light and The Water are fantastic. Like other reviewers, this disk sent me on an immediate quest to buy the rest of the catalog. This is one of my &quot;desert island&quot; disks.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|Absent from the role of 007 for 12 years (he last played the part of Bond in 1971's \\"Diamonds Are Forever), Sean Connery took one more stab at it the same year that the movie \\"Octopussy\\" was released as part of the authentic, Eon-produced Bond series. \\"Never\\" is an entertaining two hours, but only serves to sorely remind us that Connery was once great in the role and had done precious little of substance in the tween years. The movie lacks the panache and technical beauty of the Eon series, but Connery gives a fine performance, while Barbara Carrera turns in one of the best performances by a Bond woman in any of the movies.<br />A word of caution to Bond purists: Those who have been spoiled by the excellent DVD extras packed into each Special Edition disc released by MGM/United Artists will be disappointed by the lack of special features on this disk.
B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising<br />Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band<br />I'm so blown away that I'm gonna throw away all my CD's - this one is the only one I am ever going to need.<br />Bruce is one of only a few artists who could pull off a collection of songs inspired by 9/11 - and do it without draping himself in an American flag and shouting &quot;We're number one!&quot; (Bono is another who comes to mind- at least he put the American flag inside his jacket.)<br />What we have here, plain and simple, is a masterpiece. A soulful, soul-filled opus, which may very well be the defining work of Mr. Springsteen's career. On one level, it sounds great. Pop this baby in the car CD player, roll the top down and you're cruisin' - just like a real like rock album is supposed to do.<BR>From the opening riffs of &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, to the Li Li Li's of &quot;The Rising&quot;, the hip-hop beat of &quot;The Fuse&quot;, and the exuberance of &quot;Mary's Place&quot;, Bruce and his E-Streeters have re-created the lexicon of American rock music, paying homage to familiar sounds, while keeping it identifiably E Street.<br />I want to hear Van Morrison sing &quot;My City in Ruins&quot;, and Smokey Robinson do &quot;Let's be Friends&quot; - these songs seem to be written for them. On the other hand, &quot;Mary's Place&quot; could have been found from the missing tapes of the &quot;Born to Run&quot; sessions. The gospel revival choir of &quot;My City in Ruins&quot;, the Middle Eastern chants of &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, the twangs of &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, - all rich chocolate candy for the ears. I wonder how much of the credit for this goes to Brendan O'Brien - a wise choice, Bruce.<br />And the lyrics, ohhh the lyrics. Bruce has masterfully found the delicate balance between standing face to face with the deep, desperate, ultimate despair that's still hanging in the air, and the hope that things can, and will, get better. &quot;Things are bad,&quot; he is saying, &quot;as bad as theyhave ever been.&quot; And he puts it right out there for us...<br />&quot;Hell's brewin' dark sun's on the rise...&quot;<br />&quot;Sky falling, streaked with blood,&quot;<br />&quot;It's raining, but there ain't a cloud in the sky&quot;<br />&quot;Can't see nothin' in front of me, ... nothing coming up from behind...&quot;<br />&quot;Can hear the organ, but the congregation's gone&quot;<br />What Bruce also does here, is get to the poignant specificity of personal poin loss...<br />&quot;Coffee cups on the counter, jackets on the chair<BR>paper's on the doorstep, but you're not there&quot;<br />&quot;I heard you calling me,<BR>then you disappeared into the dust&quot;<br />&quot;Without you,<BR>I'm workin' with the rain falling down&quot;<br />Bruce is telling us it's OK to grieve, we have to grieve. He is helping wade through the darkness.<br />But there is hope. There is light. We will be alright...<br />&quot;I'm gonna find my way<BR>through this lonesome day&quot;<br />&quot;Meet me at Mary's Place,<BR>We're gonna have a party&quot;<br />&quot;Let's take the good times as they go<BR>and I'll meet you further on up the road&quot;<br />You can here him lifting us up on his back..<BR>&quot;Come on up for the rising&quot;<br />&quot;Come on Rise up!<BR>Come on RISE UP!&quot;<br />In classic Bruce lyrical style, recurrent themes appear throughout the songs, a la Nebraska. Seems fascinating to me, though, that the song that sums it most up succinctly, My City in Ruins, is the one was written before the tragic events that inspired the rest of the album. Not sure what that means - a<BR>testament to the genius of Bruce?<br />Hardly - just evidence that the themes that Bruce writes about are universal and iconic: Love, Hate, Despair, Fear, Grief, and Hope. But in the end, with a little Rock and Roll to help along the way, it's gonna be alright.

B000069CWE|5.0|I just bought this cd the other day, and when I put it in my CD player, I admid that I did not know what to expect. I found out that this reworking of Hybrid Theory is the best thing to hit the shelves this summer. I was amazed by the various artists that collaborated on this album, especially Jay Gordon and Aaron Lewis. The new version of Krwlng is amazing, and I can say the same for the rest of the masterpieces on the album. Linkin Park fans, you will be suprised and in awe of what they have done this time.
B0000071J0|5.0|This is my first experience of Le Orme, and I'm impressed. Though often compared to Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, this band bears relatively little musical resemblance to the British supergroup, at least on this 1973 release. There is a drummer, a keyboardist who plays organ, piano, Moog (?) and string synths, and a bassist/guitarist who also is the singer, so in that sense, the two groups are similar. However, Le Orme is far and away much more melodic than ELP.<br />The first track is the most energetic, and at 8:43 is also the longest. The drummer gets a good workout, and as the instrumentation here is tastefully sparse, he can be heard very distinctly. The singer has a very mellow and pleasant voice that would be hard not to like. The tracks all flow together well, though one could argue that the overall pace slackens a bit too much towards the middle. Still, there's little to dislike here. Simple but tasteful production values put everything in its place.<br />Silly observation: track 8 (All'Infuori Del Tempo) has a dominant riff/melody line that sounds nearly identical to John Williams' Star Wars main theme... five years before the movie!<br />My only complaint is that this is too short - only 33 or so minutes. When I hear this kind of melodic progressive rock, I wish it would go on and on. <br />Felona E Sorona is highly recommended to anyone who likes melodic rock, and especially those who enjoy symphonic progressive rock. You can't go wrong with this one.

B000069HKH|2.0|Don't believe the record company marketing, and don't buy into the 9/11 story.  This sounds like our beloved Bruce is still in the mediocre song writing rut he has been in for the last few albums.  There is nothing new here besides some Sting-like production and nice packaging.   I really, really hoped for more, but I have to be honest about this one.  The stuff is boring!  The pop tunes sound like first attempts by beginners, and it goes down hill from there.
B000002OU6|5.0|As I've been slowly but surely replacing my old and worn 60s and 70s classic vinyl record collection, I wanted to get a great CD by The Who.  I am so glad I chose this box set, as it's the absolute best collection of great Who songs I could have ever hoped for! When I purchased this, the most recent release by The Who, entitled, \\"The Who\\" compilation was not yet out, but was due to be released within 2 or 3 weeks.  But I couldn't wait that long.  I needed to have my \\"Who\\" fix in one big hurry!  I absolutely love this box set!  It has all those great songs we listened to as kids growing up and contains every Who song I could have every wanted in one kit!  Plus, it comes with a priceless book with the coolest pictures and a great timeline of The Who's career!  I mean, how do you choose a great CD by The Who if you don't already own any? One great disk to buy would be \\"Who's Next\\" of course.  And as a huge Who fan, I of course bought that one.  But I needed more...more...more!  About 3 weeks after purchasing this box set, John Entwhitle died.  I was well into grooving to this dynamite box set when the so very sad and shocking news of his death was announced.  How sad it truly is to loose a legendary bassist/musician like Mr. Entwhistle.  He was sick with a heart-condition and still ingested cocaine, which ultimately killed him!  Why,why, why???  What a shame it truly is.  But at any rate, I will always love listening to JE and The Who, and this box set is in my humble opinion the finest compilation of classic Who music available in one complete package today!  This box-set compilation is a must for the dedicated Who fan and it also contains some great skits with Keith Moon which are priceless and funny as hell! The best!  Long live rock!
B00005JL3A|5.0|This movie makes just like a good old classic horror film.  I loved it. And the extras on the DVD are awsome.  The slipnot video and All the behind the scenes axcess.  This film is the best monster fest since the game.  Michelle Rodriguez and Milla Jojovitch, both totaly hot, and both withhold tons of attitude, and do i have to mention the resemblance between the charecters in the film and the game????  This movie is definatly a classic.
B00000K3CM|4.0|This is the sequel to the mega-hit 1990 movie Home Alone.  I actually think this was one was better because they show the beautiful New York skyline and it seemed more like Christmas in New York.  I loved how they showed all the famous areas in New York the World Trade Center FAO Swartz The Plaza Hotel.  The only part I didn't like was the getting the bad guys part because I thought it was to violent for a kids movie.  I recommend this movie for the Christmas movie.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Mystery, Gore, Thrills, Chills, action, sex, pure fun.  It's the perfect monster fest since the game.  Michelle Rodriguez and Mila Jojovitch make the perfect team.  Both hot and tons of attitude, not to mention the resemblance between the charecters in the film and game.  It's pure eye candy for all your desires.  I loved it.
0553801481|5.0|This book is amazing! Its the best thing ive read yet (and ive read a LOT of books) i am awaiting the sequel with lots of exitement! If you have read Robin Hobb before, than i can tell you she has excelled herself in this book. (As she did with the Farseer trilogy, i havent read the ship trilogy) If you havent read any of her books yet, where have you been? They are the best thing since we invented pen and paper!!! I write for my enjoyment, if i could write one tenth as well as she could, i would be extremely pleased with myself! Hire it, loan it, buy it, but do whatever you can to get this book! You cant miss it!
B000001IPL|4.0|It seems amazing to me that this band is grouped with Green Day in the history of rock vs. their more similar cousin Bad Religion. This and all Offspring albums are quite good, but I take exception to two recurring comments. This is not really punk rock (this is NOT the sex pistols), i think it is power pop or skate punk, and anyone that considers this the best \\"Punk\\" (or whatever label) album of all time has probably never heard Bad Religion because they did what Offspring does well much better and much earlier. Of course, a person's personal preference is not just about song lyrics and construction, it also has to do with what was going on in their life at the time. If you found this genre of speed pop via The Offspring, it would naturally hold the \\"best ever\\" kind of place in your heart, which is fine. My only suggestion would be if you really like this album, dig back and get some vintage Bad Religion or All (the Allroy/Decsendents guys) and it will blow your mind.
B000069HKH|5.0|This new Bruce Album is a mix of mostly sad songs and some rocking and uplifting songs.  Throughout the album you hear lyrics that you say,&quot; Ah Ha that's about 9/11!&quot; The songs &quot;Into the FIre&quot;, &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, &quot;You're Missing&quot;, and many others pertain to 9/11.  Every song is at least good,but most of them are great, especially the title track, You're Missing, Mary's Place, Lonesome Day and My City of Ruins.
B000066NW0|5.0|Not pop Not punk Avril Lavigne is in a group all of her own in which she created and no one else can ever be apart of this young taltented artist is a simplely stupindous writer and a steller singer i have 2 copys of her cd and take it every where i go she is simple her self in a world of artisist who conform to consumer driven ideals she is an origanial and will stay this way i see her around for a very long time
074322454X|5.0|I have read other Ambrose books in the past, like D-day, and when i bought this book i was expecting a similar read. D-day the book was a good informative book, the first 300 pages werent even about fighting, so it was boring, but band of brothers was anything but boring.<br />The book starts off at training. Ambrose introduces you to the characters, therefor you start to feel like you know them, you feel the hate they have for colornel Sobel, and you too start to hate Sobel. This is what Ambrose did best in his book, he made it more personel, you are sad when someone you feel you know dies, you can feel their fear in those cold foxholes. This book is as informative as d-day the book, and as exciting as a tom clancy nove, that is the best thing. So if youre attention span is that of a dog and your interested in World War two, I highly suggest this book.
0553801481|5.0|I loved this book!  Robin Hobb has made a triumphant return to the world of Fitzchivalry Farseer.  As a man destined to suffer and persevere in the name of honor, Fitz is a character you can immediately respond to.  This story contains magic, triumph, suffering, tragedy, true friendship, and overall a beautifully crafted story that draws every emotion from the reader.  Highly recommended.
0380977788|3.0|\\"Coraline\\", by Neil Gaiman, is a children's book in the tradition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\", \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", in that the main character passes through a portal into a strange and wonderful world, has some adventures and comes back a wiser individual.<br />So why bother writing it again?<br />Gaiman has populated Coraline's world with two exasperated and inattentive parents, whose neglect seems to border on child abuse, two sad, mad old women who once were actresses (who are also inattentive and dismissive) and an old man who claims to be training mice to play musical instruments.  In all, it's easy to see why the poor dear would be depressed and bored and so open to the possibility of exploring the mysterious world beyond the bricked-up doorway she finds.<br />On the other side are mirror images of all the people who live in Coraline's flat, weird images with paper white skin and buttons for eyes, as well as a talking cat who aids her.  The \\"other mother' wants Coraline to stay forever and kidnaps Coraline's real parent's in order to coerce her.  Instead, Coraline musters her courage and saves the day, her parents, and three dead children whose ghosts were locked in an old closet, having been captured by the evil critter decades before.<br />I appreciate Gaiman's attempt at updating the concept, making the story a little darker and the protagonist a little more resourceful, but the gothic elements didn't really work for me, as they seemed too forced, to dark for dark's sake.  Overall, I was entertained, I enjoyed the book, but I was not mesmerized.  I was not dragged in, as I was with Charlie and his adventures in the Chocolate Factory or the Great Glass Elevator, or Alice, or Milo.<br />I realize that today's readers may not have read the old standards, so the similarities to Roald Dahl, Norton Juster, Lewis Carroll, et al.,may not seem so obvious and distracting to them.  Perhaps it's better left as a book for children.
B000069HKH|3.0|I was really anticipating this record, hoping that it would mark the return of Bruce to his &quot;glory days&quot;.  After several listens of &quot;The Rising&quot;, however, it appears that Bruce just doesn't have it in him any more.  I have been a huge fan of Springsteen since the mid-70's, but it pains me to say that he has not produced anything of lasting value since Tunnel of Love.  While I can appreciate most of the lyrical content of his new cd, the music does not match it in intensity. Everything is mid-tempo or a ballad. Bruce's vocals also do not ring with the same passion as was evident in previous recordings, such as Darkness on The Edge of Town or Born to Run (or even Born in the USA - not one of my favorite records).  Likewise, the E Street Band does not sound inspired, and the mix does not bring out the dynamic sound we have come to expect from them.  The Rising is a big disappointment, because I think Bruce and the band can do better than this. Bruce's music used to be exciting - unfortunately, this newest effort is not.
B000003TAW|5.0|Oh my gosh... One of the best albums of all time. This album could cater to anyones taste... It has everything! From the beautiful acustic rhythms in &quot;my name is jonas&quot; and &quot;surfwax america&quot; to the rockin' hard &quot;say it ain't so&quot; and ultra creative &quot;undone-the sweater song&quot;. The album finishes up with the best ending I've ever heard to a rock album... a two-minute long electric guitar duet. It's beautiful, amazing, and rockin'! Get it! Weezer is the best band of all time! The CD always makes me happy and it gets me jamming! You won't be sorry you invested in this piece of art.
B000069HKH|5.0|If you're chronologically or musically fifteen years old, don't bother buying this CD since you won't connect with either the sound or the messages. However, if you are a musically and emotionally mature listener, then buy the CD, give it a few listens, read the lyrics and you will be happy that you did.  Showing a musical range that Springsteen rarely displays while still retaining that classic \\"Springsteen Sound,\\" the Boss has put together a terrific collection of emotional and musically engrossing songs. No, you won't find any sampling (we used to call it stealing) of other peoples' music, no hip-hop beats, no electronically altered sounds, no rap crap about \\"poppin' a cap in some fool's head,\\" just straight-up rock-and-roll from one of the all-time best. <br />Though its unlikely that Springsteen will gain many new fans with this effort (though he deserves to), long-time Bruce fans will love this CD.  It is certainly his best effort in a long long time, both in the lyrics and the music.  The E-Street Band gets to strut its stuff (though not as much as I would like) and the few musically guests add interesting texture and depth to the recording. Bruce has always written songs with beautiful and emotional lyrics, but often the musical effort was lacking, or at least too predictable.  That is certainly not the case with this CD. Excellent lyrics and finely-tuned music on virtually all the tracks, each with its own deeply emotional story to tell. <br />You can argue that this CD does not deserve five stars, but it certainly does not deserve a one-star rating.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The editorial review given at the top of this page is ridiculous...if anyone out there is frustrated with the new &quot;mainstream music coming out these days, this will really be like a breath of fresh air. He is not trying to be like dave matthews and in my opinion has a much better voice. And his songs are wise beyond his years. I highly recommend this cd to anyone with any sort of taste.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Incandescent, incomparable waves of shining stardust for your ears.  This album is almost unspeakably lovely.  Each song could have been the highlight of an inspired band's career.  It almost seems a shame that Sigur Ros have given us this many songs of majesterial loveliness and beauty on one album.  Everything is here, from quiet moments of heartbreaking sadness to symphonic, multi-layered moments of incredible complexity.  Words can do much, but 5 minutes with this album will do more.  Don't come to this album looking for Radiohead.  Kid A and OK computer are different beasts--each a masterpiece in its own right, but not the same style as this at all, except that both Radiohead and Sigur Ros are pushing the edge of what we know as rock music.  Rather, come to this album with an open mind and heart.  Come to fall in love, to be soothed, to be enriched. This hasn't left my cd player for longer than a few days in 6 months, and there is no other CD in my collection that can say that.
B000069HKH|2.0|I was disappointed in the album overall. Bruce claims to have written the album rather quickly and I have to say that it shows.  Many of the songs repeat, repeat, repeat chords and lyrics in a monotonous droning that I can only describe as filler. I found most, but not all, of the songs and lyrics uninspiring despite the subject matter.  This would have made a better acoustic album and, in fact, what there is of piano and sax that are trademark E-street seem to blend into the background and lack the prominence and power that I have come to expect.<br />There are two noteable exceptions that stand out on the album, either for the lyrics and emotion [Further On] or the classic style and power that Bruce is revered for [The Rising].  The album is worth a listen, but won't make it into my stack of favorites.
B000007UA4|4.0|I just want to start out saying that I love this album!:) Kylie gets down and dirty on this one. Many tracks such as \\"Word Is Out\\", \\"Finer Feelings\\" and \\"Too Much Of A Good Thing\\" have a very prominent bass line and makes the songs seem \\"dark\\", in a way, reminding me of Madonna's \\"Erotica\\" and Janet Jackson's \\"The Velvet Rope\\". Other songs such as \\"Give Me Just A Little More Time\\" and the title track, are very upbeat and \\"happy\\". A very pretty track, \\"There's No World Without You\\",which is just Kylie & a guitar (I love the way she sings this---she actually sings \\"without you\\" instead of \\"withou-choo\\" like other singers would)and is placed almost at the end of the album. The album ends with the frantic \\"I Guess I Like It Like That\\", a shameless rip-off of 2 Unlimited's \\"Get Ready For This\\"<br />but it's awesome anyway. My personal favorite track was mentioned before; \\"Too Much Of A Good Thing\\" reminds me of Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam's classic \\"Let The Beat Hit 'Em\\" and makes me wanna dance. A great effort from Kylie. If you like \\"Fever\\", \\"Get To It\\" and grab this one.
B000069CWE|4.0|Good CD overall, but not as good as Hybrid Theory.  Too much rap, and not enough hard rock.
0767805712|5.0|<Non spoiler><br />If you thought that The Matrix was a mind-crunching look into the future, then Gattaca is something you should definitely give a shot at. Ideally, you should see Gattaca without hearing about the story or reading the reviews, and let the movie hit you with the force of its ideas. <br />There are several reasons why I rate Gattaca as one of my all-time favorites. Unlike the Matrix, which seems like its a possibility a few 100-200 years from now, Gattaca is disturbingly around the corner. The movie gives a sneak peak in wonderful manner, of the possibilities of Genetic engineering, and allows the viewer to ponder over some of its more unintended consequences. <br />The movie also has some truly sterling direction, through the use of colors, and through the depiction of the interplay of human emotions. Uma Thurman's dilemmas, Ethan Hawke's determination, Jude Law's helplessness - are masterpieces of directorial brilliance and acting superiority. The casting is definitely one of the most definitive aspects of the movie, with even the fringe cast being appropriately selected - Be it Ernest Borgnine as the Janitor, Xander Berkley as Dr Lamar and even Blair Underwood in his 10 minute role as the Geneticist. Gattaca uses some stunning shades of color and hues, which accentuate emotion, convey depth and enhance the visual experience of the movie - be it the Green hues of the beach or the orange hues of the launch pad and external world. <br />Beyond the directorial elements and acting brilliance, is a wonderful storyline. A storyline that in addition to raising some fundamental questions about mankind's role in Nature, also brings out the spirit of human passion, the emotional interplay between Ethan and Uma, the friendship between Jude and Ethan, the relationship between Ethan and Elias Koteas (who plays his brother), and even Ethan and Ernest Borgnine in one honest-to-god natural sequence.<br />There is much more to be said about Gattaca, and it is bestleft unsaid for the viewer to see the movie and experience it. Surprisingly, for such an accurate view of the future depicted so well, Gattaca is surprisingly less known than The Matrix, along which it stands as one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the last decade.<br />And yes - Uma Thurman sizzles in her muted performance!
B000059XUP|2.0|Before I start, I want to say that the main reason why I have a problem with the film is because I LOVE THE ORIGINAL.  That, to me, was an absoulute masterpiece.  So, I fail to see the reason why there should be a sequel other than to make a quick buck or two.  But that's just me.  I am not trying to change anyone's mind, and I am not trying to say that I am right about everything.  It all comes down to taste in the end.<br />I'll give the movie some credit: It looks spectacular.  At least it didn't lose the darkness and danger like the last two Batman movies did.  I guess the big problem for me was the story.  I don't know.  It just didn't affect me the way the first one did.  The bad guys seemed a lot more eviler and creepier as well.  (How can one not shiver at the sight of Michael Wincott?)<br />DVD is pretty poor as well.  No eye-popping special features on this disk.  Then again, I didn't like the movie all that much, so I guess it really doesn't matter to me.<br />Again, maybe it's because I'm so in love with the first movie.  I just think that \\"The Crow: City of Angels\\" failed to entertain me on the level the first one did.  It looked awesome, but that's the only good thing about the movie.  But, to say something positive, I will take this movie over \\"Batman Forever\\" or \\"Batman and Robin\\" any day.  So that's a good start.
6305171769|4.0|Halloween H20 is one of the best halloween films that has ever been made. It starts of with  2 young boys and an older woman murdered by of course Michael Myers. Then Myers goes after his sister and friends of her son. This is not that gory and it will not give you a scream unlike the Exorcist. If you like Halloween then watch it.
B00004Z459|4.0|.....let's face it.  This has to be one of the most overrated albums ever.  The fact that it's STILL on the billboard charts and selling crazy is really stretching it.  It's been long enough, I think.  And the airplay these guys get is unbelievable.  It can even get on your nerves.  Yes, even if you enjoy them like I do.<br />Don't get me wrong and think that I don't like this album.  No way.  I DO like the album, and I think there are some really good songs on it.  These guys combine industrial, hip-hop, and rock all together.  The results are pretty impressive, I admit.<br />My favorite songs are &quot;papercut,&quot; &quot;one step closer,&quot; &quot;crawling,&quot; &quot;in the end,&quot; and &quot;pushing me away.&quot;  I didn't really find a song that I disliked.  I like the music and the lyrics that are in the songs.  Linkin Park is a clean band, too.  So you don't have to worry about profanities if that's a big concern for you.  I, personally, could care less, but just thought it was something that should be mentioned.<br />But, I do think these guys get WAAAAYYYYYY too much recognition.  Give them time to grow, man.  They are just starting.  If you give them too much attention now, you're gonna burn out on them pretty quick.  Look what happend to Bizkit.  And, I'm not too hopeful or impressed with the group when I heard they were coming out with a re-mixed version of this album.  What?  How can they not come out with a true second album?  Maybe it's just me, but to me it looks like slacking in some way.<br />Again, I like these guys, and I do like the album.  I just think it's time to stop paying so much attention to these guys.  I can think of at least twenty albums that should've gotten more recognition and never got it.  But, that's just me.  All in all, these Linkin Park's &quot;Hybird Theory,&quot; is an awesome start.  I just fear the worst for these guys, being that they get so much attetnion.  Now, there's nowhere to go but down.  Sad, but it's true.  Then again, I could be wrong.ue.  Then again, I could be wrong.
0316926345|4.0|This is another of those books that has been on my to-read list for years, which people regularly recommended but which I kept pushing down the list . . . probably because I've never been particularly partial those other works of Waugh's which I've read -- superficial and stilted parodies like _Decline and Fall,_ _Vile Bodies,_ and _The Loved One._ But _Brideshead_ is, happily, quite different and shows Waugh at what I take to be his best. Charles Ryder, artist and scion of a minor upper class family, is a captain during World War II whose unit is posted to a large estate (Brideshead), a place where he spent some of the happiest, and unhappiest, times of his life back in the early 1920s, when he was at Oxford with Sebastian Flyte, the younger son of the wealthy and Catholic Marchmain family. The first part of the book is the story of the rise and fall of the friendship between Ryder and Sebastian, who hates his mother and sinks into alcoholism. The second part, which seems disconnected, is the story of Charles's success and the collapse of his marriage, and of his tenuous affair with Julia, Sebastian's sister. And that's about all the plot there is. But I enjoyed the book mostly for Waugh's mastery of character evolution, his depiction of the changes in Sebastian's grasp on the real world and on the growth of Ryder's cynicism. The supporting characters are fascinating: Sebastian's eldest brother, Brideshead (a lovely name!); the younger, pious sister, Cordelia; their friends, Anthony Blanche and Boy Mulcaster, who grow from tiresome undergraduates to men occasionally worth listening to; Julia's Canadian husband, Rex Mottrom; Sebastian's parents and Charles's father, and even quite minor figures in the story. There are also some great comic scenes, such as the thoroughly heathenish Rex's efforts to be converted to Roman Catholicism to please Julia's family, and Cousin Jasper's disquisition on how to be a proper Oxford Man. And Waugh's take on the peculiarities of the Anglo-Catholic world are very good. On the other hand, few of these characters are actually worth the reader's sympathy; they all have far too much money and the associated freedom to do just as they please, and none of them ever contributes much, if anything, to society at large.Anglo-Catholic world are very good.

B000059XUO|5.0|How many of you remember \\"The Crow\\" when it first came out on DVD.  If you do, chances are that you were very disappointed with it, like I was.  It didn't have any extra features, but that's not what upset me so much.  What really got to me was how horrible the picture looked.  The quality was terrible.  It was as if they just copied over the VHS and just put it on DVD.  It was bright when it was supposed to be dark.  Talk about a let down.  But now, everything has changed.<br />Now, a new and improved version is out, and it is outstanding. It was like seeing the movie for the first time. The picture quality was more than satisfactory. When it was supposed to be dark, it was dark, and when it was supposed to be bright, it was bright. The sound quality was also a big improvement, now that you can watch it in DTS if you have it. There were even some scenes that I could've sworn that I had never seen before. That goes to show you how much better this version is.<br />Although Amazon doesn't go into detail about the special features, believe they are there.  Tons of them, I should say.  There's two disks in this collection, so that pretty much lets you know that there are plenty of extras lurking about.  A very big improvement on that front.<br />Here's the story for those who haven't seen \\"The Crow\\": Eric Dravin and his girlfriend, Shelly, are brutally murdered on Devil's Night. Eric was shot and thrown out of the window, while Shelly was horribly beaten and raped to death. A year later, a hypnotic crow comes about and starts pecking on the tombstone of Eric Dravin. He digs out of his grave and is back from the world of the dead, and he wants vengeance for the murder of him and his girlfriend. He plans to make everyone who was responsible for the crimes pay with their lives. Dressed in black, with white makeup on his face, he begins his quest for vengeance and justice in this dark adventure.<br />This still reamains a favorite to me.  It is a masterpiece, or at least that's how I feel about it.  The movie has everything.  Action, drama, suspense, and much much more.  The acting is great, the script is outstanding, and the look and feel is better than ever in this new transfer.  Believe me, I know it's a pain to rebuy DVDs, but if you are a true fan of the movie and still only have the older version on DVD, get this one as soon as possible.  You will not regret it.that's how I feel about it.  The movie has everything.  Action, drama, suspense, and much much more.

B00003CXI1|4.0|I never read any of the Harry Potter books, but my mother had read the first in the series and enjoyed it, so I treated my parents to an afternoon at the movies.<br />As my mother had already read the book, she  knew in advance who the villain was... but as someone who hadn't read it, it came as quite a surprise.<br />The special effects are excellent, but are not constant... so this film may be a little too slow-paced and/or cerebral for tiny kids.<br />Fantasy is fun... and most people go to the movies not only for entertainment, but from escape. I won't go into a diatribe about \\"New Age\\" or Witchcraft influences... quite frankly, they are everywhere and I don't want to beat a dead horse... but aside from those concerns, a parent should be concerned with the trend in all child-targeted films (including this one) of making authority non-existent.<br />Harry Potter has been orphaned and growing up with hateful, loathesome relatives. Too many kids in our society live  in blended families or other situations in which there is favoritism and/or verbal and/or emotional abuse.<br />Harry is \\"rescued\\" from his life as the unwanted child by being whisked away to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Parents are not present, nor do they visit. The children at this school live in dorms on campus and there are several \\"forbidden\\" rooms that contain monsters or booby-traps and all children are informed that a visit to the library will result in certain death.  That school is one scary joint! But the attitude of the film is \\"let's have fun\\" and \\"there are no consequences for disobeying authority\\" and \\"if you don't like the ways things are going, cast a spell.\\"<br />We live in a very selfish society... and the story subtly gives the message that adults are only good for instruction in some areas, but can otherwise be ignored and not listened to.<br />Yes, it's \\"just a movie,\\" but in a world where kids are kidnapped from their own bedrooms and terrorists are looming around the corner, kids tend escape further and further into fantasy and have less and less interest or desire for reality.<br />In a nutshell, if you're going to buy this movie for your kids, then you need to watch the film with them and talk to them about it and ask them questions about what they thought about it. Any movie, including this one, should not be used as a babysitter or as a substitute for exhibiting family values instead of just espousing them.<br />As for myself (an adult) and for my parents (in their 60s), we found the film to be entertaining, humorous, clever and a good way to escape... but we all agreed that we never needed to see it again. Some films (like Star Wars) can be seen over and over again... this is not one of those films... at least not for adults. Kids who obsess on Potter, et al, may feel differently.d the corner, kids tend escape further and further into fantasy and have less and less interest or desire for reality.<br />In a nutshell, if you're going to buy this movie for your kids, then you need to watch the film with them and talk to them about it and ask them questions about what they thought about it.

0380778556|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I found it a little hard to get into, but once I did, I loved it. It's full of mystery and romance. I couldn't put it down!
B000066C87|3.0|This British movie is set in the nineteen thirties and  surronds a shooting party where one of the party is killed it then turns out that everyone had a motive for killing him even the servants.<BR>It gives a good impreshion of what it would have been like for the people back then living both upstairs and downstairs . If you only want this movie for the murder mystery you will be disapointed it does not feature in the movie as much as you would expect . It is amazing when you realize that all the charachters are dependant on one man , the man who is murdered.<BR>The acting is terrific and the casting is superb . The plot is very cleverly imagined however it can be confusing at times because it is hard to remember who all the charachters are and what they're backround is . This is a brilliant film but I would have to watch it at least twice to enjoy it properly .

0790729725|5.0|First off I HAVE to say, who cares if you have to flip the DVD to watch this INCREDIBLE movie. I was grateful to have my taped off of the television copy for a long time! And stop lessening the stars. This movie deserves a full 5 star rating no matter what the DVD plays like.<br />Anyway, moving on to the film. This is such a success I think because, well, to put it simply, there are no flaws. The incredible and perfect cast had an absolutely amazing script, and they were directed perfectly among other things that made this movie one of the best I've seen, and certainly the best mobster movie. Sorry Godfather (and part 2), but this one has it all. It shows the truth of the mob (which should really make you think) and includes comedy. So you see what their life is like. Not everything is drama all the time, not even in the mob! At the Oscars this movie was robbed and I feel horrible. At least Pesci won, thank god. I could rave for days about this movie, but I won't, just buy it and rave to as many people as you can about it. It's impossible not to!
B000068QY7|1.0|I have heard very few recorded efforts that are as poor as the offerings from Oasis. To put it simply this effort, together with everything else they have produced is simply AWFUL. The music, if you can call it is whiney and dreary and instantly makes you reach for the 'off' button. The lyrics are weak and are delivered in a pathetic whinging tone and generally the overall content is lacking in just about every single department you could possibly want to think of. Small wonder they failed so magnificently in the US, if this is the standard of garbage they have done and continue to produce. There should be a slot for 0 stars, or maybe even negative for this rubbish
B000069HKH|4.0|August 2, 2002<br />After a few initial listenings, my response to \\"The Rising\\", <BR>as a life-long Tramp and Bruce-Nut, is that it manages to <BR>get away with what it tries . . . but just barely.  <br />Had Bruce not employed a new producer for this one, it <BR>might've been a disaster.  Bruce's trend towards minimal-<BR>istic songwriting gets away from him on a few tracks here.  <BR>(At some points the repetition gets embarassing.  There is <BR>lots of \\"dust\\", \\"blood\\", \\"sky\\", etc., and a few too many <BR>tracks pound their choral refrains into the ground.)  Had <BR>\\"The Rising\\" been produced a la \\"Tom Joad\\" it might've <BR>been unlistenable.  Luckily, a good number of pop hooks <BR>and studio whiz-bangs have been infused into the mix, along <BR>with a few good, plucky love tunes.  And the band still <BR>sounds great.<br />Except for the excellent white soul and choir components <BR>on the record (at which Bruce and the E-Street Band are <BR>becoming truly masterful), \\"The Rising\\" comes across as<BR>something Steve Earle might produce, were he as inclined <BR>as Bruce to simply tell the human stories and leave <BR>outright politics aside.<br />Fans like myself, dying for either true economy to the <BR>rock tunes (how about three minutes for some of the <BR>bashier songs, Boss, instead of beating them into the <BR>ground at four or five minutes) or, better yet, a return <BR>to the days of the Bruce Springsteen epic, might be a <BR>little impatient with the more plodding tracks.  Otherwise,<BR>I think casual purchasers will be pleased by a good number <BR>of the tunes on \\"The Rising\\".
B000002BSG|5.0|THIS WAS THE ALBUM THAT INTRODUCED ME TO THIS GROUP AFTER SEEING THE VIDEO VIRTUAL INSANITY OVER AND OVER. I WANTED TO SEE WHAT ELSE THEY HAD TO OFFER AND THEY BLEW ME AWAY WITH THE SOUND TRUELY UNIQUE. EVERY TRACK ON THIS ABLE IS DOPE. EPSPECIALLY USE THE FORCE/ALRIGHT/HIGH TIMES/DIGITAL VIBRATIONS/EVERYDAY SO SMOOTH WITH THE BASSLINE. THIS IS A CLASSIC IN MY COLLECTION AND STILL GETS PLAY FROM TIME TO TIME. AT THE TIME I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE BEST ALBUM OF THERES I WAS TOTALLY WRONG IT IS GREAT BUT I HAD TO GO BACK AND GRAB THE FIRST TWO TO SEE WHERE IT ALL EVOLVED FROM. BUT THIS IS MOSDEF CLASSIC MATERIAL MUCH BETTER THAN AFO THERE CURRENT ALBUM.

B000069CWE|3.0|I waited for this CD with great anticipation.  After listening to it, I am disappointed with it.  Maybe I don't like it that much because it doesn't even come close to the original that I loved or maybe it was because it really isn't that good.<br />People that enjoy more hardcore rap/hip hop may like this CD more then Hybrid Theory but I seriously doubt that individuals who fall more on the rock side will like this CD.<br />If you are going to spend some money on a CD, I would say pick up a good bargain like FLAW or an incredible rap/rock band called Reveille (CD Name: Bleed the Sky).
B00005JL3A|5.0|Okay this is for those of you that have no idea what this movie is about.  This movie takes places a few months before Resident Evil the game comes into play, ...<br />For those of you that have never played the games or read the novels this is still a great movie with lots of action and suspense to make it worth owning and seeing countless times.  I have a feeling, with the fan support for the first movie, there is going to be a new genre of movies based on this hit game.  Look at the novels already present on the market, and still increasing with each new storyline or game.  Read the other reviews and you will see an overview of what the movie is about,...I am expecting to see a backtrack to the Mansion Incident from the game, and then a more in depth of what happend to Raccoon City.  I would recommend anyone who wants to see the movie to do so, and, like anything else, there are some who hate it and some who love it.  I happen to love it!

B00000GAIW|5.0|Aqualung is one of the albums that literally made the reputation for Jethro Tull. It is a wall to wall tour-de-force, commencing with the title tune and ending with \\"Wind-Up\\". What does one say about an album so chock-full of innovative, pulsating rock songs that it stayed on the top of the charts for endless months? Many of the songs included here later found their ways into various best-of compilations for the band, but my favorite here is \\"Locomotive Breath\\".  Ian Anderson's songs and arrangements were always irreverent, iconoclastic, and innovative, but he outdoes himself here. I especially like the way he uses the combination of classical instruments, and juxtaposes them with rip-roaring rock instruments like drums, basses, and virtuoso electric guitar work. I love listening to this album, and I'm sure you will too. Enjoy!
B000002UJQ|2.0|Is Radiohead trying to be ironic here?? Fans who listen to this album must appriciate the irony of this albums mechanical, over produced feel-the very thing this album attempts to condem. The truth is, this is not creative music, and will never be considered as such by those familiar with good music. Musically, this album shares nothing in common with Pink Floyd, and to this day, I am still baffled as to how people can see any similarity between the two groups. Sure, both groups deal with themes of dehumanization, isolation, and mental instability, but the difference lies in the actual music. Wereas Floyd did actually break the rules of rock music-through their surrealistic sounds, and the fact that often their songs can't be listened to individually but rather in the context of the album they are in-Radiohead conforms to the pop groove all the way through on this album. Personally I think this band has more in common with NSYNC than Floyd. Also, this album offers nothing new in the way of concept. Dehumanization due to technology has been happening for a very long time-most people are aware of it-they are just too weak and scared to do anything about it. It is a very real problem confronting our society. But all Radiohead is doing is preaching to the choir-reiterating an alwready known fact. They complain about dehumanization, but offer no vision for the future. All in all, I think this commercial peice of [stuff] will only serve the social machine by making people wistfull about their situation without taking action...
0684857219|5.0|This is, as one would expect, an excellent resource for anyone interested in pursuing progressive weight training as a pastime. Given the fact that Arnie has decades of personal experience and a wealth of knowledge on most aspects of the sport, who is better situated to write a comprehensive treatise of the sort offered here than Mr. Schwarzenegger? Included here is everything either a neophyte or even more experienced bodybuilder might need to engage himself fruitfully in the science of the sport.<br /><br />I might also mention that for those of us who have spent the better part of our lifetimes working out, it is quite interesting when non-bodybuilders sometimes make commentary in passing regarding aspects of the sport they either poorly understand or about which they are totally clueless. So imagine my surprise when the editor for this item remarks that some of what Schwarzenegger says regarding bodybuilding advice is \\"lore\\" rather than science, such as expanding the ribcage or developing the inner or outer chest.<br />Were he more knowledgeable about the sport, he would recognize that one can in fact successfully stretch the ligament, cartilage, and connective tissue to allow the klings to expand, and thereby expand the area through progressive exercise. Also, references made to the inner and outer aspects of the chest area actually refer to that area or aspect of the pectoralis major  muscle group, which have several aspects, and to the surrounding muscle tissue and fascia.  And these certainly can be improved and made much larger through progressive weight training. One look at someone like Mike Katz in his prime can show how well both the ribcage and the pectoral muscles can be encouraged to enlarge. So, contrary to what literary types might believe, it is not impossible to expand one's rib cage, especially for younger enthusiasts who are still in their adolescence, And while it may be difficult for older bodybuilders to do so, gains in chest expansion can be gained with persistence.<br />At any rate, this is a terrific resource for anyone looking for good, solid advice regarding the essentials of progressive weight training.  Schwarzenegger has updated and improved this book from the original, and has included a number of additional exercise, nutritional, and physiological aspects so that it is even more comprehensive than before. I can highly recommend the book, and know that anyone using it will have good, solid advice to follow in his or her physical training pursuits.

0441003257|5.0|This book is one of few books to actually have me laughing out loud.  Even the funniest of books, just made me chukle on the inside.  <br />You've probably read enough about the plot so I'll keep this brief: It's the end of the world.  Satanic nuns misplace the antichrist, and the representatives of heavan and hell don't really want the war.  So... a bunch of funny stuff happens.<br />I loved this book, and I think anyone who's in for a good laugh will too.  It's funny without resorting to all the toilet humor and stuff that I'm used to from Austin Powers and such.<BR>My only warning is that those who don't have a sense of humor (or at least a sense of humor about their religion) will find it offensive.  It doens't really mock relligion, but some people don't think humor has a place in religion.
B000069CWE|1.0|How could Linkin Park do this to their fans.  The only decent track on this CD is the Points of Authority single.  I feel deeply cheated by this album.  I hope this genre of remix albums dies here.  How can you try to better the best album of 2001.....impossible.  I am extremely open minded about all music and do like certain rap and hip hop but this is plain trash.  A bunch of wannabes trying to make their names by remixing linkin Parks songs and failing miserably.  Save your money and please, please Linkin Park don't sell this rubbish to your fans.  Stay original and fresh and bring us more unique tunes.

B000066NW0|5.0|for people who enjoy true talent, definitely check out this cd... avril's voice is incredible... and she rarely uses her falsetto... not even on track 8, and that goes pretty high... she's an incredible songwriter and musician, and i definitely recommend this cd to anyone who likes good, quality music.  track 8, \\"anything but ordinary,\\" is definitely my favorite (and it seems anyone who likes this cd gives it their highest rating, so maybe that's telling you something about the song)... i just can't get enough of this cd.  avril has a nice range, demonstrated by how low she gets in \\"complicated,\\" and how high she goes in songs like \\"i'm with you\\" and \\"anything but ordinary.\\"  there's one song i'm not too fond of, and that's because she raps/talks the verses... it's called \\"nobody's fool.\\"  don't get me wrong, i love the chorus... it's definitely worth getting through her rapping to listen to =)  for anyone who reads this, and who appreciates real talent, definitely buy this cd... it may very well be the best [money] you will ever spend.
B000001F3C|5.0|Forget the comeback album (all that you can't leave behind), the breakthrough album (the joshua tree), and their first and most successful electronic album (achtung baby), and you're left with &quot;war,&quot; the masterpiece of early, if not all U2.  This album encompasses everything U2 came to represent as well as some of their best songs. the first four as well as &quot;the refugee&quot; and &quot;2 hearts beat as one&quot; serve as some of their best songs ever. It is U2 at their most passionate and sincere.   At this point they were becoming the biggest underground band in the world.  They weren't as we know them today, they were more like System of a down for the 80's, in a way.  and this was their most unexpiramental straight-laced rock 'n roll album.  No beats or dance rhythyms here, just great rock 'n roll.

Just listen to Yanni's &quot;Live at the Acropolis&quot; to hear how much &quot;The Boss&quot; wants to be Yanni.  He always has.  I give this album 5 stars, however, because Yanni is so important that, just by trying to sound like &quot;Yanni,&quot; &quot;The Boss&quot; raises his musings a notch above the rest.  Bottom line: if you love Yanni, you will love this disc.

B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce and his E Street comrades are back and in fine form. The Rising is a wonderful mix of Rock, Pop and slower compositions that all succeed in striking an emotional chord in its listener.  <br />From the opening energy &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; to the closing gospel-like chorus of &quot;My City of Ruins&quot;, the band takes us through a changed world filled with sadness, but never losing sight of the faith and hope that's present in much of Bruce's earlier work. <br />Emotional high points &quot;Into The Fire&quot; and &quot;You're Missing&quot; recall our nations tragedy while the uplifting sounds of &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot; and the rockin' &quot;Mary's Place&quot; take us to the fun and familiar places that many fans have been longing to go. <br />Bruce and the EStreet Band are a quite a ways &quot;Further Up On The Road&quot; that they have been traveling together for over 25 years. However, in a world of &quot;disposable pop&quot;, they're still making music that's as current, relevant and exciting as anything out there. <br />Come on up for The Rising!
B000001FKY|3.0|My love/hate relationship with \\"Hysteria\\" is kind of weird.  There has perhaps been no album in my life that was more anticipated by me, and no album that generated a bigger disappointment when I put it on and realized how glossy and overproduced it was, and how it really didn't sound anything like \\"Pyromania\\".  And outside of \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\", none of the songs really grabbed me the way \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Rock of Ages\\" had done four years earlier.  Of course, as more and more singles/videos were released from it and I was able to hear those songs individually on their own merits, I started really getting into it and accepting it more.  But it was definitely a bell-shaped curve, because as still more and MORE singles/videos were released, and as more and more teenyboppers and girls got into the album, and as it blared from more and more college dorm rooms every time I walked by, I kind of got turned off by the whole thing.   By the time \\"Rocket\\" was released as the SEVENTH single almost two years after the album came out, it was like, enough already.  I probably did not pull out my \\"Hysteria\\" CD for about five years after that.  I still play it a couple times a year to relive the memories, but it's amazing just how burned out you can get on an album.  <br />So here's a summary - the first six songs are all bona fide hits that everyone's familiar with, so I'm not going to elaborate on them.  If you don't like any of those songs, don't waste your time on the album.  The second side starts out with another DL trademark, the big \\"message tune\\".  This time they discuss nuclear arms in the form of \\"Gods of War\\", replete with the sounds of bombs and then-president Ronald Reagan.  Decent tune.  From there we find perhaps the two most rocking tunes on the album, \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun\\" and \\"Run Riot\\".  Unfortunately, neither one is catchy enough to really make an impact.  Then comes the title track, which was by far and away my least favorite tune on the album for a longtime, but I soon came to like it, particularly when they perform it in concert.  \\"Excitable\\" starts out good but quickly wears thin with its repetition.  \\"Love And Affection\\" is a decent power ballad in the same vein as \\"Hysteria\\", but never really caught on with the public the way the title track did.  <br />I like \\"Hysteria\\" a lot, really I do, but compared to \\"Pyromania\\", \\"Adrenalize\\", \\"High N' Dry\\", \\"Euphoria\\", and even \\"Retro Active\\", it just isn't as good to me.  Still, that's like saying Cindy Crawford is my least favorite supermodel.  I think she would make me quite happy regardless.  Def Leppard is one of the few bands who in my opinion has NEVER put out a bad album in over 20 years, and that's saying something.
B000002MTU|5.0|Eric Clapton has seen and done it all over the years whether it's rock, pop or blues few do it better.  When you consider all of the material EC has released over his career and the hundreds of discs and compilations that contain his material, one might argue that this CD is not Clapton's best.  However, from strictly a blues perspective, this CD represents one of the very few, all blues, live recordings released by Clapton and in that regard, is his best live blues disc hands down.  Clapton has plenty of help on the disc including the guitar of Andy Fairweather low, the harp of Jerry Portnoy, the drums of Jim Keltner, the keyboards of Chris Stainton and a horn section consisting of Roddy Lorimer, Simon Clarke and Tim Sanders.  Clapton's slow hand riffs on &quot;Five Long Years&quot; and &quot;Someday After A While&quot; prove that a few well placed solo's are better then endless meandering on the guitar and help to solidify his reputation as one of the premier guitarists of all time.  Vocal wise, Clapton sings every tune with a heartfelt sincerity and pours passion into every note.  One listen to this disc and you will understand why this CD played to rave reviews when it was released, all of them deserving in every way.
B00005JL3A|1.0|I watched most of it then skipped to the end. <BR>The beginning was promising- the special op type guys were cool & professional-especially their commander. Some of the special effects were cool. But all in all I was disappointed. Perhaps if I were better aquainted with the video game I may have enjoyed it more. I'd have to say though that the \\"R\\" rating is well deserved-that is \\"R\\" for Ridiculous or \\"R\\" for \\"Rent only if you are a hard core fan\\"
0312265859|1.0|I have totally enjoyed the Stephanie Plum series and anxiously anticipated each new book, however, I am really having a hard time with this one. The characters have always been amusing but I thought believable, I no longer find them believable. Stephanie seems kinda dumb for lack of better words, and Grandma Mazur (my favorite) seems to have lost her zing as well. I keep trying to like the book so I can read #9 when it comes out and hopefully it will be better! I think Janet Evanovich has ventured a little of course with the silliness and hope she gets back on track.If this were a first time read for me I might be a little easier on my review, but I KNOW it can be so much better!
B00006690F|4.0|I am a big fan of the Slim Shady LP and the Marshall Mathers LP and bought this would right away. It took me a few spins to get to know the album and I must say I really enjoy it. Good production values. Probably a little less edgey, overall, when compared to the two previous albums. Worth a few listens if you are an Eminem fan (ie, listen more than once so you really get a feel for the album).
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the first CD that i bought, that i could actually listen to over and over again.  Every song was awesome.  With good guitar rythyms, neat DJ beats, an awesome drum line, cool rap parts, and an explosive rock voice.  These six guys (Brad Delson, Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda, Joe Hahn, Pheonix, and Rob Bourdin) have an awesome thing going.  Linkin Park takes the Rap/Rock to a new level.  Its pretty cool of what they did.  Get this CD, it is the BEST!!!!
0517201658|4.0|\\"The Thorn Birds\\" looks like a story that will be with us for a while. It's certainly an above average novel in the \\"family saga\\" genre, even though I can't get quite as rapturous as many of the reviewers. <br /> McCullough fits the cliche of \\"born storyteller.\\" She puts a lot of words down on paper, spinning the yarn out a long, long time and with no small amount of extraneous stuff. For example, she devotes at least one hundred pages to the lives of Justine and Dane when what we really want to know is what happens to Meggie and Ralph -- the ill-fated lovers who dominate the book.<br /> I don't find the love story of Meggie and Ralph all that compelling -- although it will keep you turning the pages. The real merit of \\"The Thorn Birds\\" is the vivid picture it gives of life on a sheep station in the Australian outback before about 1950 when life there became electrified and telephoneified, and more or less the same as everywhere else. <br /> \\"Thorn Birds\\" would be better if it were cut down to about 500 pages from the present 700. It seriously falters when the emphasis shifts from the outback to the theater in London and the Vatican in Rome. These are dime-a-dozen stories, but life in the outback, now that's a tale worth telling! And the author does it well.
B00005UWBQ|2.0|I'll agree that this movie has plenty of typical thriller fare which can entertain, and seeing the dinosaurs is still interesting (though nothing like the first time). But when I saw the Raptors streaking through the field, closing in on a party of unsuspecting humans, I said, \\"This is just a monster movie. Nothing more.\\"<br />I bother to write a review, however, because I'm still irritated at this story's philosophy judgement. The good guys are horrified at the team of \\"capitalists\\" who want to put the animals in a zoo. How could they be so cruel?! So an Earth First activist works with the lead female character to set them free and rescue a baby T-Rex. That single act causes almost all the deaths in the movie (including the activist's partner), but the story gives the activist a pass. The capitalists are the bad guys in this picture, least the viewer be confused, and most of them get eaten as they deserve. Ugh.
6305524866|4.0|Just watched this film for the third time, and my conclusion is the same as after my first viewing: the ending would have been much more satisfying if Charles ended up with Fiona (then I would have rated it a 5). She has more heart and honesty in her pinky than Carrie has in her whole body. I thought all of the other supporting actors/characters were wonderful as well.<BR>Granted, Carrie is absolutely georgeous. But what else is so appealing about her? She's sarcastic (in reaction to some of Charles' honest and vulnerable moments), disloyal (to the man she supposedly loves by sleeping with Charles while engaged), egocentric & insensitive(encouraging and lapping up Charles' compliments one minute and marrying someone else the next)and greedy (checking out what people have bought her as wedding gifts). Not to mention promiscious (32 lovers -- hope Charles gets a blood test). Overall, a very unappealing character. Of course, that's the character as written. All the more reason for Charles to have chosen the better woman - Fiona.<BR>I must admit that I don't care for Andie MacDowell as an actress. She's made many films, but her acting never seems natural to me. She always looks like she's acting (and preening), holding herself apart from the other characters, and never really connecting.
B000021Y77|5.0|This is one of the best foreign films of all time, next to Amelie, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Amores Perros, and Hard Boiled. It is the most fast paced movie I have ever seen, and a unique way of showing things. The soundtrack is great, and the pace is one of the best ever. Though it is a 81 min. film, it does not seem rushed, it seems like Lola did everything she could and you as well as her are satisfied.
B000002H97|1.0|I don't like it. Why all the hype about Metallica? There isn't one thing special about them, just slow, boring music on this one. However, there are worse Metallica albums called Load and Re-Load. I'm sorry, but Metallica is very overrated.
B000063DIR|5.0|I think that this is one of Ozzy's best cd's.  I have all of his albums and i would put this in the top 3.  The song \\"Diary of a Madman\\" itself is good enough to buy.  \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\", is on this album and it's a great tune. \\"Tonight\\" is one of the best songs I have ever heard, and that song is on this very album. Also the rifts from Randy Rhoads are amazing, so if you want to buy a good Ozzy Osbourne album, this is the one to get.
B000069HKH|5.0|I am still amazed at how bruce springsteen continues to speak for his audience and how he understands how they feel. on his new album, he took a different approach to his music, which was inspiring and deep. but the thoughts expressed in his music are the same thoughts his fans feel. this is an amazing album that will pick you up when youre down
B00004HYLF|5.0|The songwriting and musicianship on this brilliant work are unparalled by any music I have ever heard in any genre. As a twenty year professional musician myself, I find it hard to believe human beings can play like this and I am amazed how underappreciated this recording is by the public at large. I am thrilled every time I listen to &quot;Romantic Warrior&quot;, which is often, even after all these years. I must have heard it a thousand times, yet it seems fresh each time. I love it!
B00004XQ83|4.0|I've heard some people say that this album loses its authenticity because it was all about marketing traditional music to the masses. But considering that this kind of music never had the widespread appeal, or at least the initiative to push it, that really is a weak argument. And it's weak considering the songs themselves, the performances, awards and sales figures.<br />I might add that if you had asked me 10 or 15 years ago to buy an album of this music, I would have told you you're crazy. But the honesty of the songs and the playing and singing give me goosebumps every time I pop the disc in my player. It really is a fabulous snippet of traditional music.
0316666343|4.0|I am enjoying this book and hope to see more from this author!  I read it quickly but would not consider it a &quot;light&quot; read.  The characters have depth, and it has honest, believable dialogue.  The first chapter covering the girl's abduction is gritty but it reflects events we read about daily in newspapers. The book overall demonstrates that violence impacts and changes everyone.  Would be great for a book club because the book touches on many topics for discussion.
0671027344|4.0|When I started reading this book I will admit I was not impressed, I found it to start out slowly, with the same boorish teenage angst and cliched themes that are present in most novels dealing with American Adolescence these days. However, at some point this short little book became enrapturing, and enthralling. As it tells the story of Charlie, a high school freshman growing up in the South Hills of Pittsburgh, a world or bourgeois boredom in this former steel city. For Charlie, his freshman year is filled with episodes of reality few high schoolers experience during these four idealic years, but yet perhaps most should. From the cliched adolescent topics of friendships, homecoming dances, and Friday night football games, to the bestial and sordid of homosexuality, sex, drugs, and of course the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Chbosky does an excellent job of walking a fine line between the cliche and angst filled pessimism. Chbosky also litters the book with realistic scenes from Pittsburgh, from a cathartic experience in crossing the Ft Pitt tunnel, to Patrick's trips to the \\"Fruit Loop\\", dancing at Pegasus down on Liberty Avenue, and frequent trips to [a restaurant](Big Boy as Chbosky titles it, but we know the truth). A definite read for anyone unable to relate to Holden's whining, and optimistic about life after high school.
B00006690G|5.0|This is probally the best of all of his albums. My favorite song would probally be superman.You should listen to it on the preview list and i think that you would agree with me that it is a good song. I would recomend this album to anyone who: 1) Is having problems with their life right now because he talks a lot about his life problems.<BR>     2) Anyone who likes eminem because he is probally the best singer/songwriter i have ever heard<BR>     3) Anyone who wants a change in their music and hasen't heard eminem yet.
B000069HKH|4.0|I was a bit amazed. yes, amazed. Because this album of Bruce with his E-street band (finally, after 18 years!!) is so beautiful! Man, this is good!!! Good & Pritty. Why? well, first & foremost: the E street band (Nils, Steven, Patti, Gary, Danny, Roy, Clarence & Max) sounds better than ever. Second, Bruce's voice is still one of the best. Third: this album goes mainly about that sad day we all know, without becoming too melancholic. Some songs (like \\"Mary's place\\") are even a bit of... optimistic. Last but not least: producer Brendan O' Brien (who worked with pearl jam, aerosmith & countless others) did his job very well, so the sound quality is more than good. But why only 4 & not 5 stars ? Well, 4 & a half would be better. There are a few reasons: the song \\"worlds apart\\" is weird. It's more of a world music song. Second & last: the violin is beautiful, but not in all songs. Sometimes it's too heavily there. That are the only weak points I found. But \\"the rising\\"'s song material is so strong, you forget them easily. This album is already a classic and I hate critics who compare it to \\"born to run\\" or \\"the wild, the innocent & the E-street shuffle\\". Those albums were made 30 years ago, so don't do that!! I'm not saying that they're bad, not at all, but this is a new age. A very beautiful, strong & intense one. Simply a must!! by the way, can't wait to see them live!!
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down's, Toxicity, was the cd that got me into heavy music(nu-metal/metal).Toxicity is my favorite cd for one reason.....it's perfect.  It's heavy when it needs to be, and melodic at the right times.  Every song holds it's own unique message and sound.  I love every song on this musical masterpiece.<BR>Rating(1-10)<BR>Prison Song-(8/10)<BR>i'll finish this later
B000065V1V|3.0|The last Bowie work, \\"Heathen\\", reminds me the \\"Black Tie White Noise\\" experience of 1993. That year Bowie got married, he was in his mid fortys, and his music was in a transition from the trash-80s-pop he has been doing since 1984 to the modern and risky techno beats of his \\"Outside\\" and \\"Earthling\\" albums. Now Bowie got a new daughter (Alexandria, born in 2000), he is in his mid fiftys (getting dangerously near to the sixtys) and going from the techno music to nowhere, apparently. \\"Heathen\\" is definetly in the \\"Hours\\" way, without that noisy and disgusting guitar riff of Reeves Gabrels, but with the colaboration of Tony Visconti, the producers of his early records. In the same way of \\"Black tie...\\", \\"Heathen\\" contains lots of collaboration and cover versions, but little of something new. \\"Cactus\\" by The Pixies is much better than this weak interpretation. \\"Ive been waiting for you\\" is OK, but Neil Young is better. The Dave Grohl and Pete Townshend guitar riffs sounds more like a desperate help than a real co-work. The lack of original and fresh music is dramatic, but Heathen is still a good record, if youre a Bowie fan. Personally i feel cheated buying a CD with covers of other songs. \\"Black tie...\\" contained than awful Cream version of \\"I feel free\\" and that strange Morrisey song \\"I know its gonna happen someday\\", plus several remixes of the same album songs. That year i felt cheated too.<BR>If you buy the special edition, the cheat is bigger: a second CD with a mediocre remix of \\"Sunday\\" (by Moby), plus a live and not so original live version of \\"Panic in Detroit\\" and \\"Conversation Piece\\". Why they choose that and not other songs? What that songs has to do with the first CD? If someone could answer me, I would feel a little better...
B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising just keeps getting better each time you listen to it.  More poignant, more on target, more compassionate.  Beautiful ballads, with painfully true lyrics of loss segueing into uplifting rock rifts.  The sequencing of the songs is very well done.  I think down the road when we think of 9-11 we'll hear songs in our head like Empty Sky, Nothing Man and Into the Fire. I was in downtown Manhattan on 9-11 and Bruce's music has an unmistakable ring of meaning for me.  This album should please Bruce's long-time fans (of which I am one) as well as those who listen in for Bruce's 9-11 - inspired tunes.  I can't wait for Aug. 12 when I see him in concert.
B000069CWE|4.0|Alright in contrast to some people in this review section I'd have to disagree to calling this stuff just \\"Hip-Hop\\"...In my mind these remixes are more rap and industrial/metal remixes with a little hip-hop here and there  If you like Rammstein, Orgy, Gravity Kills or any other band along those lines you'll love these remixes...except for the rap portions of course but those are there so there's something for everyone
0783230702|5.0|There is a tiny handful of great filmmakers in the Western world, and Terry Gilliam is perhaps our only great fantasist.  Each film he makes creates a world you've never been to, and shows you something you've never seen - and isn't that really why the works of great artists are remembered?  This would be a saner world indeed if the movies of Gilliam and his collaborators were as popular and as discussed as those of derivative hacks like George Lucas; I predict that Gilliam's are the movies that will be studied, and revered, by future scholars of film, should we - and the form - survive.  And no speculative film of the 1990s - with the possible exception of Gilliams's own, more realistic &quot;The Fisher King&quot; - got anywhere near the tragic beauty, dramatic intensity, or sheer breath-taking scope of vision in &quot;12 Monkeys.&quot;  It's a sad commentary on the state of our collective literacy that a complex movie like this one is considered &quot;confusing&quot; rather than exhilerating, and whose emotional canvas, subtle and devastating, is deemed cold and out of reach.  Viva Gilliam!
B00000JMQC|5.0|This was a pretty good sequel. Many people didn't like it because it didn't live up to the standards of the 1939 masterpiece The Wizard of Oz. Well, let's face it, you can't remake a clasic! For a sequel, this was pretty good. It's a little too scary for the smaller children, but other than that you see a lot of great stuff.
B000069HKH|5.0|When we thought the Boss had lost his rock and roll heart, had become a man of acoustic balads and old standards, he comes out with the stories of those he has always written about, at a time when these people are most in our hearts and minds.  The hard working man and woman, carrying a lunchbox who saw their city, their country crumble before their eyes on that awful day.  Saw thousands of their brothers and sisters disappear in a storm cloud too awful to contemplate.  It was that American, the union member, the firefighter, the police officer, the teamster, who decended upon Ground Zero and began to dig with their bare hands.  Dig to find their lost friends and heroes.  Dig to find their country.  This album, with the Jersey beats and the painful cries, the desperate lows and the joyful highs, truly captures the spirits of those people that The Boss has sung about for years.  A classic that may just help the future understand what the American working man and woman went through during these hard times.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Surely the best of the movies based on computer games. I guess it did help that the game actually had something resembling a plot (unlike &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Mortal Combat&quot;, &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; etc).<BR>Cool fx's, a serious amount of fighting and Milla nekkid really makes this worth 90 minutes of your life.

0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones had me from the first page, a morbid curiousity for a horrifying story, but one that sucked me in immediately. The first page tells us, from  first person narrative, that her name is Susie Salmon & on a certain December day, she was murdered while walking home from school. So begins the story of Susie Salmon's murder. The rest is a look at how the Salmon family & the rest of the community cope with this horrible tragedy. On the flip-side we get to see, what Heaven looks like to Susie. Not only is the story line incredibly unique, the writing is excellent. Sebold seems to take a look at all of the supernatural things that people talk about after a person's death, and offer up unique explanations. More importantly though, the story centers on watching how the Salmon family copes, imperfectly, at one of the most devastating losses, that of a child. A true page-turner, The Lovely Bones is about family, love and the afterlife.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Eight years after it's initial release, there has been some backlash, (by a small minority of people) against this movie for various reasons. Reasons ranging from the film's financial success, it's portrayal of the mentally challeged, the \\"Bubba\\" (Mykelti Williamson) black \\"sidekick\\" character, the portrayal of a paraplegic (Gary Sinese), the revised use of historical events and famous people to fit into the story...etc. The list goes on and on. Overall, everyone generally likes this movie (but some hate to admit it). As things go in cycles, perhaps the small negative backlash will subside and people will admit that they really like this movie again. No need to reiterate the plot. Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis have produced a feel good movie hitting some pivotal points in American history from the 1950's to the mid 1980's, seen through the eyes of the title character. Great special effects, great cast, great acting, great direction, and great script. Great everything! FORREST GUMP deserved all of its accolades and awards. Anyone who needs to feel nostalgic, get a lump in their throat, and wants a short history lesson, should watch this film. One gripe is that there was nothing written about Robin Wright's performance of \\"Jenny\\". She was great in this movie. The Special Edition DVD has all the extras. A timeless classic film overall!<br />Note-- Best piece of subtle filmmaking(with minimal special effects,which the film had loads of): Forrest Gump gets on a bus for new army recruits. In a profile shot, he intoduces himself to the bus driver(a soldier) and the driver yells at him with expletives etc. In the background, the windsheild wipers are going back and forth because it is raining outside.  It looks like the bus driver is slobbering as he's yelling at Forrest, but it is the rain water and wipers that's causing the effect. Whether this was an intentional or unintentional shot by the director, it's brilliant and funny nontheless.
B000066NW0|5.0|I heard Compicated on the radio, and was impressed, so I downloaded Things I'll Never Say at random to see if Complicated was just a fluke. Needless to say, I bought it as soon as it came out, heh.<br />After listening to the entire album, I realize that Complicated is actually one of the weaker songs on the album. <br />Things I'll Never Say is a Michelle Branch-ish pop-rock song that blows you away. Avril really shows off her voice in this song. <br />Mobile is another groovy pop-rock song. <br />My World is one of my favorite songs on the album. It's pure pop, but is more musically diverse than Complicated. I live in a small town and this song captures the feeling of living in one perfectly.<br />Nobody's Fool (If) is a song I like alot, but might turn some off with the rap bits. But Avril pulls it off somehow.<br />Too Much To Ask and I'm With You are the other stand-out tracks. Quiet rock ballads that gives me chills.<br />Sure, some of the songs may sound similar, and the lyrics may be a bit immature (Sk8er Boi), but this girl is definitely going places.
0446608955|5.0|This is a very cute, funny, romantic, and heart warming book.  It's about true love, something each and every one of us long for.  It is very well written and I read it in about 2 days.  Definately worth everyone's time.
B000069CWE|4.0|Big ups to Linkin Park on a great Remix album. It's definitely not Hybrid Theory, so if that is what you are looking for you might want to pass this one up. But if you're into West Coast underground and &quot;real&quot; Hip-Hop then this might be an album for you. I'm amazed that nobody so far has complimented them on the mix of artist that they were able to assemble for this project. It's nice to see a multi platinum band put on such artist as Evidence &amp; DJ Babu (Dilated People &amp; The Beat Junkies), Chali2Na (J5), Aceyalone (Freestyle Fellowship), Rasco &amp; Planet Asia (Cali Agents), and Cheapshot (Lexicon). Hopefully it will expand the horizons of some of their fans......because I'm guessing more than 90% of you haven't heard of Aceyalone, Planet Asia, or Ev before this! Do yourself a favor, if you like this LP remix album.....pick up a Freestyle Fellowship, Dilated People, or J5 CD......it's some of the most under rated and under appreciated music around.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I thought resident evil was brilliant, although the story line was changed from the original story which was supposted to be based on the game. The actual mansion is not infested with zombies it is the HIVE (A Special Research Place) which is underneath the masion and also runs under the town above (Racoon City) The zombies weren't what i expected, because they werent gory but on a scale of puking i would say 7+. <BR>The film overall was a superb success and i can't wait for the sequel.<br />Hope u enjoy the film.........
0446677450|5.0|I really enjoyed reading \\"Rich Dad\\". Besides presenting a few valuable concepts likely to really help the average guy improve their attitude towards money and getting rich in important ways, I really liked his insights into how most of us are brainwashed into building a view of life very much like that of the poor dad's. I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with living like that, except that most people who go that way are not usually given the choice... (Which is why I think the poor dad was also pretty cool to recognize his limitations in this direction and send his son to the rich dad for advice.)<BR>After finishing the book I checked out the free audio downloads you can get at the poor dad website, but I was disappointed. Both the materials and at least a couple of other books that followed this great market success seemed (like it happens so often) very \\"commercial\\", with very little to add and mainly intended to exploit the newly-acquired prestige of the author. Maybe some useful factual information in \\"Own your own corporation\\" and \\"Real Estate Riches\\" from the same collection (actually written by other authors), but you may still want to consult a professional before you decide to swing into action...
B00005JKQZ|5.0|After watching this movie for the first time at a friend's house, I decided that it was one the best films ever. The next day I went out to the nearest DVD rental store and got it to show my parents. They loved it just as much. The acting is fantastic - I was an overnight Russell Crowe fan. The story is amazing (it's true!) <br />One thing that really got stuck in my head was that music. I was humming it for weeks afterward!<br />One thing that I also really liked was how extra stuff there was on the DVD. I'm a person who when I see a movie I like I  have to know everything I can about the making of it, the actors, everything. This DVD gave me all that. And not just a whole bunch of writing that you get on some DVDs but actually little movies with Ron Howard etc... talking about it. Very statisfing. I also highly recommend the CD of the music!
B00003CWNR|5.0|As a John Irving fan, I would have to say that all other attempts at crossing over from books to bigscreen have failed. The Cider House Rules is the exception. Although many will argue to say that Garp was successful, I think this movie stays a lot truer to the book. I think in the future if more Irving books are to be made into films, the screenplays had best be left to John Irving Himself. It displays an extroidinary performance by Michael Caine, and an equally amazing performance by Tobey Maguire as Homer. The bottom Line: Worth a look
B000069CWE|5.0|i like it.  it is as good if not better than &quot;hybrid theory&quot;.
B00003ETJQ|5.0|Baraka is a 104 minute ecstatic musical/visual journey into the diversity of human culture and the common threads that bind us all: humans from different cultures and ethnic backgrounds, as well as humans to non-human animals.
B000021YQV|5.0|It's almost surprising to hear a band of Systems' intensity<BR>played with such regularity on the radio, but they're popularity<BR>doesn't detract from their quirky, powerful metal stylings. This disk kicks MAJOR *SS all the way through!! From the intro cut, \\"Prison Song\\" to the last track, \\"Arials\\", it is an aural treat. Serj's vocals combine with music that is undenialbly crushing to produce a sound that is unique, and oddly enough, despite the dark undercurrent of this CD, celebratory. Listen for yourself if you think I'm off my rocker!!!<BR>      System Of A Down's music on this sophomore effort doesn't over-shadow their previous self-titled disk, it merely expands upon what they began with it. And Serj's lyrics relay a man in tune with his reality......he gives voice to angst and sarcasm, along with biting social commentary ('Science', 'Toxicity' and 'Psycho'; reveals an upbeat side with tracks like 'Shimmy'; and finally balances things out by revealling a thoughtful flirtation with spirituality in tracks like 'Jet Pilot', 'Chop Suey!',and 'Aerials'. All in all, \\"Toxicity\\" is a very satisfying release. It's quirky, dark, fun and intelligent. Definitely a must for your collection!!
0066620996|5.0|When it comes to business books written about research work, I have tended to place them at the lower end of my reading stack.  However, once I picked up this book, I could not put it down.<br />The author even admits that the results were surprising, that many of the traits of the leaders, culture and style of the \\"great\\" businesses did not fit the mold of what we would normally expect.  How timely to read about great companies when so many companies are being destroyed by their leadership.  The findings were surprising to me also...but supported what I believe is the key problem with today's CEO's...short term focus to satisfy Wall Street.  \\"Good to Great\\" confirms that these companies and their leaders are building businesses...not for this quarter's results, but for the long run.<br />You will discover the findings of \\"Level 5 Leadership\\" to be eye-opening and refreshing...but very contrary to the \\"star\\" CEO stereotype that the media honors.  You will also get very good insight into \\"First Who, Then What\\".  This will be a hard concept for many executives to really grasp and adapt to, as it has the nuance that really good employees can better define the direction than the leader....Mmmm.<br />I personally also enjoyed the \\"Technology Accelerators\\" section from my first-hand experience in dealing with corporate innovation initiatives.  The author's findings support that great companies \\"apply\\" today's technology...you don't have to invent the new technology. This is really a hard concept for corporate executives to understand.<br />This is a keeper...I highly recommend this book.  A must read for business leaders that really, I mean, really have a passion for \\"building\\" a business that will last.  I don't think that there are too many executives out there that truly understand that anymore...these findings just have not been a part of executive scorecards for quite some time.  It is time to learn from these findings and change our leadership ways.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is a fabulous CD to add to your collection!  Every song on this is a great song to listen and dance to.  I guarantee you'll be singing along!  I bought this CD because I saw the movie (a great movie), and what a surprise I got when I found six other fabulous songs on it that weren't even in the movie!  You won't regret getting this!
B00005JKNC|5.0|This movie, as I recall, was laregely ignored when it first came out. It deserves a bigger audience on DVD or VHS. For some it might be overly long and preachy but if you look beyond that you will find a sweet, sentimental movie that has a lot of heart. I thought this movie would expand Jim Carrey's scope into more mature roles which he is capable of and is deserving. I could easily see him one day winning the respect of the Academy voters and finally getting an Oscar for a movie and not a lifetime of them. Why is it that comedians like Robin and Jim Carrey do so well in dramatic straight roles? Supporting actors like Martin Landau and David Ogden Stiers also give unforgettable performances and Laurie Holden is not only a gorgeous actress but she emotes depth and emotion with subtleness. The movie is also very beautiful to look at with a lovely California town and scenery which looks like it was painted by Thomas Kinkade. This is also a great movie to watch with your grandparents, your mom and dad without worrying about swearing or sex. Yes, it's schmaltzy and sentimental but sometimes we need movies like this!
B000003TA4|5.0|Looking at the one-, two- and even three-star reviews of this album, I find it painfully disheartening that there are so many seemingly intelligent \\"music fans\\" out there who cannot grasp the fundamentals behind punk's musical and social manifestations. If Kurt Cobain were alive today, he would be quick to deride all the brain-deprived sheep who lament that his band's musicianship is substandard or that his lyrics are nothing more than confused, depressive, \\"heroin-inspired\\" drivel. His music is much, much more than that; true beauty need not be made-up to be beautiful, after all.<br />Cobain despised the contrived, emotionally hollow arena-rock acts of his day; he was avowedly anti-mainstream, and he would have sickened with disgust over the mere thought of writing a clichéd, feel-good radio anthem filled with fancy guitar licks and meaningless machismo lyrics about sex and fast cars. Like all sullen, dissident youths of the `90s, he was profoundly disillusioned and dissatisfied with the state of his surroundings. That inner pain and confusion lead him to create art of astonishing originality and depth: his songs relay feelings of anger, discontent and alienation with a piercing, infallible sincerity and a gorgeous vulnerability that remain unparalleled by the majority of today's well-known artists.<br />The simple guitar riffs and brisk, catchy hooks that power \\"Nevermind\\" are an unalienable quintessence of the punk-rock sound - and they are a vital force behind the album's ultimate greatness. Cobain's creative genius can be felt everywhere on this record - from the magnificent, furiously impassioned call-to-arms that is \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" through to the bleak, heart-wrenching strains of \\"Something in the Way,\\" this is a timeless record that is as revelatory and powerful as it is culturally important.  Some may call it overrated, but I find those opinions to be completely immaterial. Although \\"In Utero\\" is my favourite of Nirvana's studio albums - it was the only record that Cobain believed to be a true reflection of his artistic vision - I still harbour an immense appreciation for their commercial debut. Simply put, it's an amazing piece of work, and it deserves every ounce of praise that it's received.
038533558X|5.0|In my previous review, I was unfair to Mr. Coben, by not checking with him first about my concerns.  He replied to my e-mail and &quot;enlightened&quot; me about my misconception.  This is a great book, and I sincerely apologize to all those fans who felt I trashed it unjustly.  To err is human, to forgive is divine.  A little footnote, though:  if you read the description of John's thoughts about Julie Miller, they still seem cold and harsh, which is what misled me.  But all in all, it is a great book!
B00003CXSM|1.0|Don't Bother to watch this Movie! It has a stupid plot. But Even Worse, The whole time you are watching the moving, you know the actors are Acting!
B000003TA4|5.0|After getting their start with &quot;Bleach,&quot; Nirvana put many fans under a spell, but they longed for something better.  It was 1991, when &quot;Nevermind&quot;, their second CD was released.  This CD, in my opinion, changed new rock and roll forever.  With the heavy songs like Smells like Teen Spirit and In Bloom, to the sttractive come as you are and Lithium, Nirvana simply did it all perfectly this time, as every song on the CD is enjoyable.  Highly recommended.
0316779237|5.0|...the content can be found in all of his other books, which makes this one more of a &quot;collector's item&quot; for those of us who have read literally every other thing Mr. Sedaris has written. <br />Well, what the heck! It's a cute little book and it's on sale.
B0000035E7|3.0|Bleach was Nirvana's first CD.  There really only are a few memorable songs, such as About a Girl, Downer, and Negative Creep.  You may enjoy the 80's-ness of the others, but they really don't do well with repeat listens.  If you're a true Nirvana fan, you'll own this album, but otherwise, choose carefully.
B000067CPX|4.0|I'm noticing a trend here: long-time rhcp fans are disliking this album and the newcomers are totalling eating it up. I realize this album isn't as raw as previous outings, but its not supposed to be. This is the most seriously introspective and emotional chili peppers album ive ever heard. The songs aren't about sex and drugs on this one, there about growing-up, death, and love. and it sounds great. Johns guitar playing is magical and in your face on this one, while flea settles in the bakcground, quitely adding backgrounds for the songs(every now and then getting extemely funky). <br />I still love past albums by this band, the ones you play louldy over the wind and noise, while driving to the beach or to a party. but this album, its more for the late drive homes. The songs are more meaningful i guess, more mysterious and emotional; this is an incredible album ; and i place it above anything else the chili peppers have ever done. sew me.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This time around, Britney has created some more involving songs like \\"Boys\\", \\"Im a Slave 4 u\\", and \\"Overprotected\\".  Not to say her last album was bad, but this album is a great improvement over that one.  Also, if you're looking for music from Britney's film, Crossroads, this CD has a few songs from that.  A Very enjoyable album.
B0000046KM|5.0|If you read the earlier reviews, almost anything I could say would be redundant. I believe this is Shirley's finest album (also my favorite). This is a woman who sings about all of the experiences and emotions that we have all felt......and makes it so extremely personal. With a ballad, she has no peers. Her use of time and space between words has always reminded me of the way Miles Davis played the trumpet. <br />The orchestration should be required learning for those arrangers who aspire to use strings in a jazz album. This is the ultimate example!<br />If you want to experience something excruciatingly beautiful, get this cd!
B000003TAR|5.0|Shortly after the release of In Utero was the suicide of Kurt Cobain, which foreverleft fans helpless.  But it helped that In Utero is a good album.  There are many favorites here, like Scentless Apprentice, Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me, Dumb, and All Apologies. I also like Serve the Servants and Tourette's.  Highly recommended album with great songs.
B000069CWE|5.0|when i heard this cd i thought O MY GOD the songs are so PURE thjey JUSS flowed through my head!!! i was lookin for 100% alternative AND THIS IS IT they should make a new gernee called reanimation!!! the songs are put 2 getter so.....so.....perfect. if u lovbe metal and alternative GET THIS CD NOW!!I would pay [large dollar amount] for this cd<BR>its so hard 2 put it in words....MY GOOD IS THIS CD REAL OR AM I IMANGIN IT??? I WANNA RATE THIS 5000 STARZ
B000069HKH|5.0|I have the top down, driving to work and taking my time.  The Rising is in the CD player.  Without listening to the lyrics, it's vintage Springsteen (although I prefer a little more Clarence).  With the lyrics---I have to close my eyes wide and barely see the road ahead, as the images of these words are strong, sad, knowing.  A mature artist who still rocks better than most.  A collection of related tunes that is worth the country drive.  Lyrics that are worth taking your sadness and anger back to 9/11, to examine how it made you feel and where you've been since that day.  <BR>Who says &quot;blouse&quot; anymore?  Such a lush word that pins his age and experience to his poetry.  Give it a listen.  A rockin' road album with the emotions of winter!
B00006690H|5.0|i haven't actually heard the clean version of The Eminem Show, but since i got a hold of the explicit cd a few weeks ago i swear i have not taken it out of my stereo....except to put it in my discman so i can have it with me wherever i go. <br />i have never been a fan of eminem as i dont appreciate all the unnecessary cussing in his songs, but after listening to a friends cd one time thro i was a convert and it has instantly skyrocketed to being the most AWESOME cd in my collection. <br />the lyrics are all incredibly deep and often brutally honest, and its amazing that a person with such a background and public image can have such amazing talent. his passionate love for his daughter is as beautiful as the stories of his mother, father, and wife are painful.<br />i would recommend this cd to anyone who loves hip hop, eminem fan or not. it is a must have
0767906543|5.0|This was one of my favorite books all year. The main character's turbulations in finding the meaning of commitment is remarkably true to what happens in life. I found it very warming and at some parts I found myself laughing out loud! Highly recommended
B000069HKH|5.0|Although they may have gone seperate ways, this album proves that when Bruce gets with E. Street the magic happens. There is never a moment on this album where you feel that ANYONE is running on empty, everyone is giving their all and thanks the production of Brendan O'Brien (most notable for his production work with Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and other alternative acts) the sound is updated just enough to not sound like 80's rehash, yet it retains Bruce's signature.<br />Why five stars? Well, the music is great, Bruce's vocals sound as strong as they did twenty years ago (actually stronger) and the lryics are as fine as Bruce has ever written. Bruce has always had a gift of being able to document American history though his eyes (the perspective of the common man) and his finest work is when that happens. This has been Bruce's style and that's why he is probably the only artist alive who could deliver an album like this and recieve high critical acclaim for it.<br />On The Rising he holds nothing back, every American had feelings of fear, anger, sorrow, and we all went though healing in our own way. Bruce's lryics document his feelings from the perspective of those most touched, he accomplishes this silenty and without any direct reference, in fact it's so descreat at times you can't tell if the song is about 9/11 or if it's something else and inbetween the great moments of silence we have some really great rockers: The Fuse, Further On (Up The Road), Waitn' On A Sunner day are fantastic.
B00003CXRM|4.0|It was funny, right under Miller's Crossing as the best Coen brothers film.<br />The Odyssey is on my night stand, just waiting to be read.<br />And to the woman that coplained about George Nelson shooting the cows, c'mon. Do you really think that the ASPCA would allow them to use real cows?
B000002BUY|5.0|Science is truly an icredible album, it gets you hooked from the beggining to the end. Their album's unique style of funk and metal, deserves the title SCIENCE, almost like an experiment. With Brandons fast rapping (or whatever you want to call it), and the electronic touches from DJ Lyfe, truly makes this album stand out.A must have album for every Incubus fan.For those who are expecting this album to be more like Morning View and Make Yourself, it is totally different, much more heavier and funky.  And for those who are looking for something more refreshing, just get this album. Fav Tracks: New Skin, Certain Shade of Green, Deep Inside, Anti Gravity, and Vitamin
B0000047CW|5.0|&quot;Jazz Samba&quot; is such a great album that only one other bossa nova album exceeds its quality- &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;.  Getz and Byrd, jazz musicians, not only introduce Brazilian bossa nova to a larger audience, but do so in a way that is timeless.<br />Many of the compositions here have become classics of our culture, &quot;Desifinda&quot;, &quot;Samba de Uma Nota S&oacute;&quot; and &quot;O Pato&quot;.  Don't worry if you don't recognize the titles, once you hear them you recognize the music.<br />If you have &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; than &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; won't disappoint.  This is great music that belongs in everyone's collection.
B00004U8JV|4.0|The Lost World takes us back to that good ol' land of the dinosaurs to see another experiment screw up, and a lot of people attacked. This time, John Hammond thought he was just sending a team of four (Including a returning Jeff Goldblum) to another island where they housed the dinosaurs to photograph and document the dinosaur's lives. What Hammond didn't expect was that the new head over InGen has sent a huge team to capture a variety of dinosaurs to bring back to the states for a theme park. When the capture of a T-Rex baby goes wrong for the bad side, and the good side rescue it, all things go awry and the action begins.<br /> Steven Spielberg brought us The Lost World, based again on the book and screenplay by Michael Crichton. Although there's not all the spark that was ignited in Jurassic Park, The Lost World still has enough light to give an enjoyable action ride. I see it as this. When Jurassic Park ended, you wanted more T-Rex and raptor attack scenes and you wanted to see more beautiful imagery with extremely crafted CGI dinosaurs walking around. Well, that's what was given to us in The Lost World, but they used an interesting plot to surround the mix. And we get even more dinosaurs this time around.<br /> Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm, and his character is a bit less annoying here, even though the same character feel is obvious. Julianne Moore is his scientist girlfriend who is sent to the island by Hammond. Vanessa Lee Chester adds the usual kid element in the JP films, and much like Joseph Mazzarello and Ariana Richards in Jurassic Park, she wasn't a bit annoying, and her chemistry with Goldblum was great. Vince Vaughn held out his own, and play the protector pretty good. The rest of the supporting cast were a mix of likeable / annoying characters. And the dino talk between the red headed / bearded guy and Julianne Moore was fairly interesting and it sounded as if they were truly discussing dinosaurs.<br /> The DVD is almost similar to the Jurassic Park one, with the Making Of feature, and plenty of photos and special effects featurettes. The Dinosaur Encyclopedia is also present. As is two uninteresting deleted scenes. My question is why isn't the pterodactyl helicopter attack scene here? There's also another scene not present that was shown when FOX aired The Lost World a while back. The video and audio transfers were great.<br /> It's obvious I'm a fan of the Jurassic Park movies, because most people actually dislike The Lost World for either being boring or not like the original. I know it's not like the original, but in its own, The Lost World is a great action flick with plenty of Spielberg heart.
B0000047CX|5.0|Bossa nova would never be like this again.  Getz, along with Jobim and Gilberto managed to craft a collection of songs that remain timeless.  Too often relegated to tacky lounges and muzak, the songs on &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; define both an era and an genre exceeding even the great &quot;Jazz Samba&quot;.<br />While not only an album of great artistry it also became one of the most successful jazz albums of all time. The compositions are so tasteful and accessible that they rise beyond genre satus to that place where jazz lovers and popular tastes share. Not to be underestimated is Astrud Gilbero's vocals on great songs such as &quot;Girl From Impanama&quot; or &quot;Corovado&quot;.<br />I've yet to share this album with anyone who didn't like it regardless of their musical tastes.  An all around classic and winner in every sense.<br />No matter what your musical tastes are listen to &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;. You won't be disappointed.
B00000JZC4|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever heard.
B000069CWE|1.0|I thought this cd would be still in the rock scene while mixing. Though it was well remixed, It's to into the rap, hip hop, ghetto cr@p. I've give this cd the thumbs down i regret buying it...Linkin Park can do better then this, this was some rap garbage to me.
B000067CPX|4.0|&quot;Don't Forget Me,&quot; and &quot;Dosed&quot; are stand out tracks and &quot;Carbon&quot; and &quot;Warm Tape&quot; stink up the record. All in all..it's good..but it lacks the RAW, EDGY, EXCITING, flavor of their other records. I suggest listening this CD very loud, dancing to it, and singing along. It also helps me fall asleep.
6305718954|4.0|This is a thought provoking and generally wonderful film. Yes, there are religious errors that a Catholic can easily spot, but the basic message that Christ should be found inside each individual person, not in buildings, is really valid and important. Anyone who thinks that their religion is to be found only in chruch buildings and not inside themselves really needs to seriously examine their own faith.<br />The biggest fault to be encountered with &quot;Stigmata&quot; is that to really discover many of the subtleties and meanings in the film is that the view MUST listen to the director's comment track. The first or even second time viewing of the film not knowing the director's intent raises questions not easily answered. Example: many of the views of water and water drops and candle flames look like beautiful photography but whose meanings are muddled. The director points out that he was showing that the spirit of the priest who caused the stigmata was traveling through the elements - water, air and fire. The whole idea of the clensing fire at the climax of the film can be lost without hearing it on the director's track. It is also interesting that he explains the meaning of the ending on the theatrical ending of the film, but not on the alternate ending.<br />The film takes on a much deeper meaning when a viewer is familiar with what the director wanted to convey. This is a real fault and the reason I had to give it 4 stars and not 5.<br />After listening to the director's comments, the meaning of the film really becomes clear and the film much more important. Anyone who has only seen the VHS version sould really make a point of viewing and listening to the DVD extras.
B000067G3C|5.0|An excellent video source with an amazing audio track(s) make this non-stop thriller come alive again.. Wall vibrating sound and a tension level not often experienced....enjoy and turn up the volume--A great THX release...
0316666343|5.0|I was really afraid to read this book after sifting through all the hype surrounding it and reading a few of the reviews on Amazon. I didn't want to waste my time reading a maudlin, sentimental \\"beach read.\\"<br />But I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. *The Lovely Bones* is not a highly complex, multifaceted novel, and the prose occasionally borders on purple--that's true. But the narration and characterization are straight-forward (as befits a 14-year-old's perspective, in my opinion) and there's something so fresh and original about the whole novel that I was immediately captivated. <br />Sebold has crafted a work that plumbs the depths of need, longing, and maturing on both sides of the thin veil that separates the living from the dead. It's not another talk-show-pick-of-the-month book, delving again and again into all the horrible things that can happen to women, children, and the people that love them; it's broader and yet narrower in scope, tracing the ties between the victim and her family and friends over a series of years, limning the way those ties tighten and fade and eventually heal.<br />Sebold has created a truly original heroine in Susie Salmon, one entirely believable and real, yet the other characters manage to live just as fully in the reader's imagination as she does, from her parents to her sister's boyfriend. The settings (mainly suburban Pennsylvania and Susie's heaven) are well-drawn as well, although I admit I'd have liked a few more details about heaven. Who wouldn't? <br />All in all, I highly recommend this book.
B0000640VN|5.0|Even though Meg Ryan is a very good actress, this movie was all Hugh Jackman, baby. Without him, I don't think this movie would have even made it out to the public. Don't get me wrong, Meg Ryan wasn't bad in this movie - the role just didn't seem like it should be for her. Her cute little routine of scrunching up her nose and having that boyish walk was not exactly glorified in this movie, so heh yea..anyway, I recommend this movie for rainy days, I suppose, and when you have the urge to watch a gorgeous man (ahem, Hugh Jackman) strut his stuff. Very romantic, and so incredibly cute. It'll keep you entertained all the way through. =)
B00005R2M3|4.0|The range of this sassy CD is as fun as the music.  Her voice jumps from latino spice to mature woman and then sashays through a country sound that leaves you wondering if there is no end to her roaming variety of vocals.  She flirts, reprimands and dreams while inviting the listener to enjoy and partake in the ride that is Shakira.  Even the songs that she sings in her native tongue relay the message she is conveying, through the soulful sound of her voice. Enjoy this one!
B00000163G|5.0|There's not much to say. Tupac is one of the best all time rappers, wait, no, he IS the best all time rapper. This album, like all his others, is simply fantastic.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Her voice overrides the accompaniment of the instruments behind her.  Norah uses her voice like a low melodius trumpet to the surprising bliss of the listener.  Getting lost in her music, you are tranported to a smoky southern summer night, filled with thick air and swaying moss, dripping from trees.  The lyrics and tunes come from a place of joy and pain and her voice relays those emotions in this wonderful morsel of a CD.  Buy it, pour a mint julep and sit on a porch while drinking in the libation, the night and her songs.
B00005Y228|5.0|I had never heard of Kylie Minogue (other than seeing her name on Madonna's shirt) until 'Cant Get You Outta My Head' was played on the radio.  I instantly fell in love with the song, and I still haven't gotten sick of it.<br />I decided to purchase this album two days ago, after downloading a few other songs from it.  I really enjoyed listening to it.  It gives you the &quot;want to dance&quot; feeling...but also can be very relaxing in an odd sort of way.  Some of her songs sound like something from 'Super Mario Brothers' which is original and refreshing! <br />My favorite songs off this album are the title track Fever, Love at First Sight, Can't Get You Out Of My Head, Dancefloor, In Your Eyes.  Note:  If you are expecting to get the US version of Love at First Sight on the CD, be aware that the album version is different.  I prefer the 7&quot;/Radio/US version, so if you have an opportunity to get it / download it you should do so.  <br />I strongly reccommend this album.  If you are not sure, trying downloading or listening to some of the songs I listed above to make your decision.  Its a greay purchase!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|From Mr. Rochester to a professor in &quot;Circle of Friends,&quot; Ciaran Hinds finally gets a role that is truly spectacular!  &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a wonderful movie that will not disappoint any Jane Austen aficionado.  It is worthy of a space on your self next to A&amp;E's &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;
B000069HKH|4.0|.<BR>Oh it is sooo good to hear Springsteen back, singing songs he cares about.  When all the artifices of clever chords melt away, popular music has to boil down to sincerity, and this CD has tons of it.  The melodies and arrangements are more interesting than I've heard from him in a LONG time - - if he weren't such an established artist you might refer to this as a &quot;breakout&quot; album.  It's that distinctive.<br />The PROBLEM (and I'm saying this as a New Yorker) is the Sep 11 thing.  It doesn't need to be so strong in a record.  It's not that I'm offended, or that it's because I lost friends - - it's just that the theme is SO unrelenting.  It needs a break.  Imagine a CD of oh you broke my heart and several variations.  You'd get bored of that.<br />Mr Boss, I want to send you hugs, but there's a lot more than Sep 11 going on.
0316666343|5.0|I'm a father of a girl who is half Susan's age and with everything going on in the past 2 months I was compelled to read this book.  With the narrative being from a childs point of view and myself a father, I felt so much for the family.  Alice brings you right in to feel for everyone affected by Susan's death.  How it affects the rest of their lives, and I felt like I could relate.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Bought this CD yesterday out of sheer curiosity. Now I can't stop listening to it over and over again. It's music drives me happily mad. Yes, is true: you can find Bjork, trip-hop, lots of noise, crazy (but well thought and crafted) lyrics around a robot-killer girl whose name is Yoshimi and a robot who fell in love with her (so he decided to kill himself in the middle of a fight with her). Although this is not a concept album, believe when I say that this album was supposed to be a logical step to bands like Genesis or Pink Floyd. They lost it. But we have Flaming Lips and this album, which is fascinating. Buy it. Enjoy.
6303965415|5.0|This movie was magnificent because it wove such a sweet story and told us of love that stood the test of time.  This story doesn't give a lot of attention to the high society or wealth of the characters, nor did it dazzle us with splendid manors; it showed us only enough to show the situation of Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth.  The storyline is more focused on their enduring love.  It is simplicity; yet, way beyond with all the puzzlement and confused thoughts from Anne and the tortures of Captain Wentworth, who tries to treat Anne with indifference after she refused his love years ago.  I liked this story because it was genuine, with characters you can sympathize with.  Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds give wonderful performances; truly hard when most of the battle is within themselves.
B000050IKM|1.0|This video, as well as Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart, was apparently created by the most self-centered stage mom in the world.  I believe that my children are cute, yet I would never include snippets of them being just \\"oh-so-precocious-and-precious-and-sassy\\" on a video that I am selling under the guise of being stimulating and educational!  I just want to tell Ms. Aigner-Clark to please, if you want them to be in the movies, then go ahead and audition them -- but leave them out of videos that are supposed to be educational!  (And that are making her millions, I'm sure!)  It's not the fact that she shows children in the video -- it's just that their sudden and random appearances are incredibly irritating and disruptive, and there are no other children shown.  If you have blond-haired, blue-eyed daughters with pretentious names like Aspen and Sierra, then by all means, purchase this video -- they can watch it while you're working on their pageant gowns.  However, if you like the thought of babies and children appearing in the actual context of the video (such as playing with the toys -- what a concept!) and want your children to be exposed to some ethnic (and gender) diversity, then stay away from this series and buy the Brainy Baby videos!  My sons adore the Brainy Baby tapes -- and I think they are much more entertaining and educational, and are of a higher quality.  In addition, the voice of the narrator on the Brainy Baby series is very baby friendly without being irritating to adults.  Ms. Aigner-Clark's voice, on the other hand, sounds like she's been breathing helium.  These videos were very disappointing to me, but we have really enjoyed the Brainy Baby series.  So there's my 2 cents worth --might sound harsh, but the creator of this video should have focused more on the actual topic rather than on showcasing her daughters!!

0811826848|5.0|The Beatles Anthology is a wonderful and very informative book on how the Fab Four came to be.  Starting with the childhoods of the 4 men, ending with the Beatles' breakup in 1970, leaving not a moment behind.  After reading this WONDERFUL, informative book filled with loads of pictures, I feel like I know every Beatle personally and that I was there for every performance, every recording session, every high, every low and EVERYTHING in between (even though I was born 16 years after the Beatles breakup).  EXCELLENT!
B00006690G|5.0|When I ordered this, I fully expected it would get three or four stars. That is the way most follow-up albums go. The first was best. The second was great (and awfully popular). Not much hope for the third, but it is a surprise. Yes, Marshall has grown up. His lyric roll, like, non-stop (mix of Dr. Dre and David Lee Roth). The album is full at 77 minutes. Much pain shows, more so than anger of the first two albums. Actually sounds like he will make a good dad. Be fore-warned, \\"Drips\\" is probably one of the most sexually explicit songs on the charts (and probably one of the worst on the album, unfortunately).  I really like \\"Sing for the Moment\\", \\"Hailee's Song\\" and \\"When the Music Stops\\". Much like David Bowie and Elton John, there is more there than you hear at first.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I liked this CD, it was interesting to me. She sort of remind me of a Madonna jr. She dances and sings way better than Britney! The little young woman, with a strong voice, had something to say. She spoke her mind, in this CD, and some folks were intimidated by it. I'm sure she doesn't care, and I say to her; &quot;you go girl!&quot; The key tracks on her CD that I really liked, were: (Get the party started), (Going to California), (Respect), and (Family Portrait.) Keep up the good work Pink!
020161622X|5.0|Okay, so it has been a long time since you read &quot;Code Complete&quot;. Time to brush up. This book is a retreat for road-worn warriors. Many good ideas (okay, not all of us will give up our productive IDE habits). Good presentation. I like the exercises along with the answers in the back. I especially like how the answers are presented. Typically, it is just the answers. This book has both the questions AND the answers in the back. No need to flip back and forth. Also, it is harder to get the answer to the next question by accident (typically if it is just answers, my eyes wander to the next answer).<br />The only complaints I have are the cover. First, it curls too easily. After reading first 20 pages, had permanent curl to it. Second, the color/material is grease prone. I take good care of my books (I often sell after reading once and the buyers swear they are in mint condition). However, after that same 20 pages, the cover had fingerprints and smears on it. It may be due to the dark charcoal color. Probably more due to poor materials. So, buy it, read it, keep it on your bookshelf.
