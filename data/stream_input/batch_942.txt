B0026P3G12|5.0|I Dreamed a Dream, the CD is outstanding.  The title song is probably her \\"signature' song, now, however,in this CD she displays a wide range of songs and singing virtuosity.  I can't wait for her next album and, perhaps, a live concert in my area.  Thank you, Susan!
B000P0J0DI|3.0|Wow.  Does this epic, award-winning Western look and feel like the real deal.  It's gritty, rugged, brutal, dirty, inhumane--yet tender and poignant when it needs to be.  You can't beat Clint Eastwood as both actor and director; fellow cinematic heavyweights Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris give UNFORGIVEN plenty of star power.  And the story--a former bounty hunter coming out of retirement to avenge the disfigurement of a working girl--is as compelling as the day is long.  So what is it about UNFORGIVEN that so disappointed me, and continues to disappoint each time I pull up a chair to watch this very well-made film?<br /><br />Dichotomy.  It's a trait we all possess, to some degree.  It's certainly present with Hackman's character as Sheriff Little Bill Daggett--a dedicated public servant on the one hand and brutal thug and bully on the other.  That's a character contrast that's believable; we can see, and understand, both sides of the coin Little Bill represents.  But Eastwood's character presents a whole new set of problems (for me, anyway).  Bill Munny is a quiet, soft-spoken, gentle widower with two young children.  From his mannerisms it becomes evident he wouldn't harm a fly; he reluctantly agrees to accept the bounty because he's so desperately poor, but approaches the job with dread and despair.  As this film moves to its violent climax the viewer is treated to such a transformation of Bill Munny that I was unable to suspend disbelief.  The wild-eyed, almost evil incarnate killer Munny became was simply too much--even after he was so savagely provoked.  Thus I was aptly disappointed in UNFORGIVEN, a great visual epic with too much to digest.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
037583494X|5.0|I think it was a great Idea to have the CD with the book.  I had made a Dr Seuss for a friend who just had a baby and I purchased the book and cd so the older brother who is 4 could read the book to his little brother.

I challenge anyone to read the vicar and the afghan hash cake story and not laugh!!<br />It's good that Ozzy gets out some of the classic stories in his head. Sure the book mentions drug use and alcohol abuse yet what i like about it is that the book doesn't get bogged down on that issue. Unlike the Eric Clapton book.<br /><br />The book has great photos. Is well written and is very entertaining. Once you start is very hard to put down.

0307408833|5.0|I've made a couple of things from this cookbook so far, and have had no problems, in fact the banana bread and chocolate chip cookies turned out delicious.  I have celiac disease and my son is allergic to milk, eggs, and nuts, so finding treats that we can both eat is very difficult.  It is somewhat expensive to buy the ingredients, but pretty much all of the gluten free, allergy free products are expensive and usually don't taste great.  It is also hard for us to find baked goods without egg in them, so this book has been great for us.      I don't know if I've just been lucky as far as my desserts turning out correctly, but I will say I read all of the intro part of the book and the back of the book where ingredients are discussed before I cooked anything.  She talks about the brands of ingredients she prefers, and discusses things like melting your coconut oil before you measure it.      I love this book, and I can't wait to try more recipes!

B000W7JWUA|5.0|An awesome mix between Risk and Monopoly, but better than either one. In fact, I know people who don't like Risk or Monopoly, but still love Catan. Because the game board can be randomized, the game can change each time you play it and there is no one sure-fire strategy to win. There is enough skill involved to give an edge to those who seek it, but enough chance that anyone can win any particular game. Try Settlers, you won't regret it.
B00005JOHC|4.0|Co-creator Chuck Lorre has been involved in several good sit-coms, a television form that we can see degenerating before our very eyes as producers found out that people would just as happily watch a television show that consists of a collection of nobodies with no discernible talent being followed by a camera.<br /><br />If that sounds like an editorial comment aimed at bashing reality television - you are correct, and my advise is to make your OWN lives interesting enough that you're not tempted to watch a television show that consists of the exploits of real people less interesting than YOU!<br /><br />But I digress.  I enjoyed Lorre's previous shows: Roseanne, Grace under Fire, Dharma and Greg, but it wasn't until I became addicted to the genius \\"Big Bang Theory\\" that I decided to go back and check out \\"Two and a Half Men.\\"<br /><br />I see \\"Men\\" described as a modern version of \\"The Odd Couple\\", and there are similarities as both shows featured a fastidious man who is kicked out by his wife, then moves in with a slob.  \\"Men\\" stars Charlie Sheen as older Casanova Charlie Harper.  Charlie is a jingle-writer and has made enough money to live in a Malibu beach-house where he avoids work and responsibility and beds as many bimbos as possible.  Jon Cryer plays brother Alan, a chiropractor who has an inferiority complex about essentially everything.  Alan's son Jake is played by Angus T. Jones and provides the writers an opportunity to exploit the ways that young Jake may be influenced by Charlie's degenerate lifestyle.<br /><br />Melanie Lynskey steals her scenes as Rose, a neighbor who has been stalking Charlie ever since a one-night stand.  Holland Taylor plays the brother's shallow, self-centered mother Evelyn and Marin Hinkle plays Judith, the cold-hearted wife who booted Alan.  Conchata Ferrell is another scene-stealer as Berta, Charlie's no-nonsense housekeeper.  Berta sees people for what they are, and as the show is populated with one character flaw after another, Berta has ample opportunity to unleash her sarcasm with maximum comedic effect.<br /><br />I withhold my highest recommendation because the characters are shallow and one-dimensional.  Charlie is perpetually irresponsible and completely lacking respect for any woman while he is more than willing to engage any dim-witted beauty in a sexual encounter.  Alan is perpetually downtrodden and lacking respect from himself or others.  The other characters are even more \\"one-note\\".<br /><br />I find \\"The Big Band Theory\\" better than any comedy on television today.

0385532458|1.0|I like to listen to most books as audiobooks. I try to steer away from those read by the author, as usually authors are good at writing their books, but not at speaking them. There have been a couple notable exceptions, such as Stephen Frey and Frank McCourt,  where the authors have had drama training and are quite good and entertaining on the CDs. John Grisham is not among them. I could not even listen completely through the first story it was so badly read with too many punctuated words and choppy sentences. I am a huge Grisham fan and will may have to find this book in a paper version and read it.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|Man on Wire is an incredibly impressive documentary about a man who's most impressive achievement, the achievement this documentary is centered around, wasn't even caught on video. Almost as impressive as the man this documentary is about is the way the documentary was made, using present-day interviews, dramatic re-enactments, and photographs to illustrate the one-of-a-kind tightrope walk by Philippe Petit.    The title comes from a description of Petit in the police report filed after he walked between the two World Trade Center towers. The film begins with people recounting what lead up to Petit's high-wire act, while a well-filmed reenactment plays. This opening scene is actually suspenseful, even though much of the audience will already know what Petit did. The film follows Petit, a self-taught wirewalker, as he recalls first hearing of the towers before they had even been built and his desire to walk across them the moment he heard about them. The World Trade Center was not the first building Petit had walked across; in fact he once walked the Notre Dame Cathedral. Of course, we do see video footage of Petit walking on a tightrope, as well as jogging on one. When Petit does his tightrope walks, it's a beautiful spectacle and Petit should be happy to know that the beauty he saw in his acts is not lost on his audience.    Of course, when Petit finally announced his plans to his friends/team to walk the two Towers, he was met with skepticism. Even his girlfriend Annie, who had supported all his (illegal) walking endeavors, was unsure of this. The towers were still under construction when Petit began planning and it made it easy for him to sneak in. While there is video footage of Petit plotting, there is (as I said earlier) no video footage whatsoever of him walking between the towers. The photographs of this act alone are breathtaking, but video is not necessary to lend to the credibility of this documentary.    Annie says that Petit saw his act almost like a bank robbery and there are scenes here that seem to be illustrating a real-life bank robbery. This makes the documentary all the more engrossing and accessible even. How often can you say a documentary was not only thrilling, but suspenseful? Not only that, Man on Wire uses dramatic reenactments better than just about anything I've seen. It's done in an artistic way as a way to visually illustrate the story being told to us, without just being a contrived way to have less interview footage. Petit says in the film, referring to the dangers of his twin tower walk, \\"if I died...what a beautiful death.\\" This is obviously a poetic outlook on the consequences that could have come from his act, but you believe that he believes it to be true. Some have called Petit narcissistic, but he deserves to be. I personally would be quite impressed with myself if I had pulled something of this magnitude off. Petit did not help world hunger, his act did not change the world, he's not a hero to the world...In fact, before the release of this documentary I had never heard of Petit. But he did give the world something dangerously beautiful to marvel at and this marvelous documentary, as well as the events that have occurred since Petit's walk, have taken that beautiful act and made it all the more beautiful and poignant.    GRADE: A-

B000063JZQ|4.0|I'm no Shakespeare junkie; let me get that out of the way right quick. I've only read a few Shakespeare plays and I've seen only a few Shakespeare film adaptations, none recent enough to tell you what I thought. Having recently read Macbeth and seeing that Roman Polanski (whose name has been a lot more prominent lately) made a film version, I was intrigued and that's why I'm here now. Having never seen another screen adaptation of this famous play, I have no standard to hold Polanski's Macbeth to. However, I can tell you that Polanski's controversial adaptation is an unsettling, challenging film that has been hated by as many as those who have loved it.    A synopsis of the story from me is not necessary; while Polanski does not follow the play verbatim, he maintains the spirit of Shakespeare's play enough that the story is still the same. The script was written by Polanski and Kenneth Tynan, with Hugh Hefner as the executive producer, but rest assured...This is not another Caligula. Polanski uses virtually anonymous actors to tell this timeless tale and what a wise choice it was; it allows us to see the character's onscreen rather than the actors that portray them. Despite their anonymity, all of the actors are credible and believable.     I was shocked watching this film that it hasn't received more acclaim. The three witches are rendered perfectly in the physical sense and are creepy without being campy. Moving on, while Polanski and cinematographer Gil Taylor give Macbeth a monotonous look, adding to the somber tone of the story, there are moments however where the imagery here is picturesque. Not a single review I've read mentions Jon Finch as Macbeth and I was greatly impressed by him. The actor really does take Macbeth through a complete transformation over the course of the film. Polanski's Macbeth is not a perfect film and there are aspects I feel Polanski could have handled a little better, particularly the scene of Macbeth with the dagger which felt somewhat campy to me.    This is not the film version of Macbeth you're likely to stumble on in a high school classroom. Lady Macbeth sleepwalks in the nude (which I think may have something to do with the name on that producing credit) and many have commented on the violence in Polanski's Macbeth. I don't think that Polanski has made Macbeth violent as, written by Shakespeare, Macbeth is a violent story and Polanski has simply refrained from sanitizing the violence in Shakespeare's work. Yes, the murder of Duncan was not shown in Shakespeare's play while it is shown in the film. One gets the feeling that Polanski was still reeling from the violent death of his wife Sharon Tate at this point and I think that many of the more violent scenes were a way of showing the animalistic nature of humanity. There is a scene where Macbeth has a vision in the witches' lair and I think there are few who are familiar with Tate who will not be inclined to bring her to mind. I got the sense that Polanski was not in the happiest of moods while shooting this film.    Macbeth is an underrated, overlooked, very well-made adaptation of Shakespeare's work. It's a challenging, dark, pessimistic film with a haunting ending (one that differs from Shakespeare's). It's not the most accessible film whether you're a Shakespeare junkie or a Shakespeare virgin, but it is a terrific film worth of praise and attention.    GRADE: B+
B002SJIO5E|1.0|The aliens looked totally fake & a lot of the time that should have been used explaining why the human race appeared not to care that aliens were on the planet Earth was wasted with what appeared to be live camera footage in the main actor's face.

Just for the sensible ones do not spend 1/3rd of your album on covers of theist's recycled old standards.  IN Short...do some original work to really show your voice.

B002XGRSBI|5.0|I have literally been in love with Paul McCartney since I was a young girl.  I have loved the Beatles music -- Lennon and McCartney is unbeatable team.  I loved Wings.  I have seen Paul at RFK Stadium and Cleveland Stadium back in the late 80's.  I thought that was amazing.  I have to say that having attended this new concert series at the Redskins stadium a few months back, I was amazed.  This wonderful man who has given us so many songs and memories was just AMAZING.  He sang and rocked for over 3 hours almost nonstop.  His voice was top form, especially for his age.  He looked as handsome as ever.  I fell in love all over again.  It was a high like no other.  This CD/DVD set is a wonderful way for me to relive the memory of this event over and over again.  I will never get tired of it.  Thank you, Paul, for the concert and for putting it on CD/DVD!  Unbelievable!!!

I believe in her potential but this CD is weak.

0882709194|5.0|I believe in God not Darwin.  In Lingit (Tlingit language) our first name for Creator is Kaashgeinya \\"He who made everything from nothing\\".  That said, I believe, that for the age he lived in, Charles Darwin did a remarkable job explaining the 'How' of Creator's work.<br /><br />Mr. Comfort is fearful of people using the brains Creator gave them.  This deceitfully titled book abridges Charles Darwin and replaces the original with Mr. Comfort's (weak) defense of his god.  Most persons comforted by it will never read the real thing.  They know everything already.<br /><br />Like Jon (22 Oct.'09) I'm giving this book 5 stars because I think it's important to ensure as many as possible intelligent, educated, and thinking people show this book to their children and say, \\"look kids, this is what blind dogma does to you -- it turns you into a complete moron\\".

It's the perfect combination of beat-driven passion and beautiful melody (instead of being bland and soporific). This is an album with which to sing, loudly.
B002C6K7NU|4.0|Anytime Lynyrd Skynyrd comes out with a new CD, infrequently as that maybe, the reaction is almost universally the same: They're not as good as the original.  Well, how could they be?  Skynyrd was born of a bunch of high school friends who learned all the facets of their craft together, plus Ed King (good), Billy Powell (great) and later Steve Gaines (brilliant).  Few bands can compare with this, let alone replaces the pieces taken away by the famous plane crash that killed Ronnie Van Zant and Gaines, among others.  A downgrade was inevitable.    Johnny Van Zant on his best day is a passable singer.  He has bad days.  And if Ricky Medlocke was good enough originally, Ronnie would have kept him around.  Instead he moved on to Blackfoot, a  band not in any way in Skynyrd's class.  Only Guitarist Randall Hall was worthy of the Skynyrd tradition, and he's been gone for years.    But that doesn't mean Skynyrd's second incarnation can't rock.  The tribute tour gave of us a very good reworking of Swamp Music.  1991 offered \\"The End of the Road.\\"  The Last Rebel, the album, represents their best work.  And there's scattering of very good rock since:  \\"Good Luck, Bad Luck\\"; \\"Talked Myself Right into It\\"; \\"Rockin' Little Town\\"; \\"Mad Hatter.\\"    And that, too, is the best description of God & Guns: Solid Rock.  Though, as with most things, it has its highs and lows.  Of course there had to be highs.  Gary Rossington is still with them.  And Billy Powell, but sadly only for five songs due to his death in January of '09.    But more importantly, a major low has been removed.  Johnny Van Zant has finally gotten away from the heavy-handed way in which he has always delivered his messages.  I believed this self-revelation was revealed in the line \\"I ain't here to preach no sermon\\" from \\"Right-Side Up,\\" off Van Zant's Brother to Brother, a truly great rock CD.  This realization was a long time coming.  Just make your point, as passionately and cleverly as you can; the rest takes care of itself.  To wit:    Still Unbroken:  A song about surviving life with your true self intact.  Nothing preachy here; just straight-ahead lyrics.  An effective way to open the CD.    Simple Life:  The opening verse is as close as Johnny gets to Preach Mode.  But quickly the song veers back toward the subject reflected in the title.  Not as good as Still Unbroken, but far from bad.    A Little Thing Called You:  Back to a staple of all music: love songs, or busted love songs, as the case may be.  This is the latter.  Again, solid rock n' roll.    Southern Ways:  Remove the second verse, which applies to Skynyrd directly, and I can picture Tim McGraw singing this.  Perhaps a touch too mellow for classic rock, but still worthy of Skynyrd, which has a long history of dipping into both country and blues.    Skynyrd Nation:  Unfortunately, considering the subject, one of the lesser efforts.  Though sporting some good guitar work, the vocalists seem to get carried away beyond proportion to the song.  Here enthusiasm is a detriment.    Unwrite That Song:  Easily the best song on the CD, and the best ballad from the Skynyrd family since Johnny's Brickyard Road gave us \\"Love Is Not Enough.\\"  Not to be missed and should be a radio perennial.    Floyd:  Another example of getting carried away to detriment of the song.  I hate deriding artistic integrity--you have to play it the way you feel it--but the insipid repetition of one word (more than once, even) ruins a potentially great effort.    That Ain't My America:  Here it is.  Their beliefs out front for all to hear but not a sermon in sight.  This is how it's done.    Comin' Back for More:  Some of the phrasing is reminiscent of Van Zant's \\"Show Me.\\"  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  A good song is a good song.    God & Guns:  You can probably guess the subjects.  Pure politics in a song that changes tempo in the tradition of \\"Freebird\\" and \\"The Last Rebel.\\"  Works for me.    Storm:  Another quality cut.  Nothing greatbut it doesn't have to be.  Again, good is good enough.    Gifted Hands:  Like Mad Hatter was in memory of bassist Leon Wilkinson, this one's for Billy.  When their heart is completely involved in a piece, Skynyrd is magic.  It's just unfortunate that it was necessary.  It doesn't even matter that the lines in the chorus don't rhyme.  Rest in Peace, Billy    Bang Bang:  The over enthusiasm that ruins \\"Skynyrd Nation\\" and \\"Floyd\\" is kept in check here.  The song is by no means frivolous but fun was had too.  Fervor done right.    Raining in My Heartland:  Not all the images and their connections work, but enough do.  Heart and a great tune help.    Hobo Kinda Man:  A throwback song.  Works for what it is.    The Live Tracks  (\\"Red White & Blue,\\" \\"Call Me the Breeze,\\" \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\"):  Financially I can't complain about filling out the disc with these performances as we were not overcharged for the second disc.  But considering live CDs are all that Skynyrd have released over the last decade or so (and another on the way, I hear) it can get wearing.  OTOH, since we'll never get to hear Billy play live again, I'll take it.    This could well be Skynyrd's last CD of original material.  It SHOULD be if we lose Rossington, the only surviving active member, along with his wife.  But there are conflicting emotions here.  I understand Johnny has dedicated his life to, as stated in \\"Rockin' LittleTown\\": \\"Makin' good music, keeping it alive. . . .\\"  And yet the second verse of \\"The Last Rebel\\" was about Rossington:    'Cause he's the last rebel and he's all alone  He's the last rebel, his friends are all gone. . . .    That's how I see him.  Maybe it should end with him.  But I have to admit that Billy Powell was my favorite and it's just not the same without him.  My view is skewed.  If this is their Last Hurrah, however, I'm satisfied.    For Skynyrd fans: B+  For those who just know the hits: B-  For Amazon's rating system: 4 Stars
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I grew up with the original Star Trek series but that is where I stopped. I could never get into the ones that came after. Why? No Spock, pure and simple. When this movie came out, I didn't go. I didn't think they could get it right. So I waited for the DVD. Did I like it? Well, I've watched it three times in the last week.     I thought Zachary Quinto as Spock was dead on. In fact, it revived the unrequited love I've had for Spock since 1967. I could definitely kiss this Mr. Spock in an elevator. I'd like... No, love to be Uhura.    Seriously, it was fast paced, fun and a joy to watch. A great popcorn flick. I hear they are making a sequel. I can't wait.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This CD strikes a major chord!  Every song is heartfelt, soulful and perfect.  A great alternative to mainstream music.  I have recommended this CD to all of my friends and family.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was really suprised when I put this DVD into the player!  Level 1 is intense and it only increases from there.  I really like the 6 minute circuts and the fact that the only equipment you need is a mat and some handweights.  I have been doing this workout 2 times per week over the past month and have seen increases in my cardiovascular endurance and muscle tone.  The only caution I have is for people with knee limitations -- you may find some of this to be very difficult.  Overall, I think this is a fantastic workout video; and who doesn't have 20 minutes to put towards better health?!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This CD is great!  Her music is simply delicious.  It's great to finally have one of her CDs in my collection.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|I've always enjoyed Tarantino's films, but someone needs to put a leash on this guy.  I don't mind watching an unconventional war film that presents itself as alternative history, but, in the end, what did this film really amount to?  The dialogue was interminable, the scenes were interminable and the film's self-aware, I'm-so-clever-and-quirky-and-outside-the-box tone just aggravated me.  Plus, I'll say it, I thought the film was boooooorrrrring.  Do your worst, if you care to comment.

0385504225|1.0|Let's see, what qualities does this book have.    Boring prattle that goes on and on and about ridiculous trivialities? - Check  Extensive, lengthy offensive segments about torture and murder from the victim's perspective? - Check  Completely unbelievable plot with holes the size of small planets? - Check    Frankly it's difficult for me to believe how stupid everyone in the book has to be to allow the plot to move forward.  Apparently everyone in this story is a complete moron to not see through the \\"masterful disguise\\" and the \\"evil genius\\" plans of the antagonist.    I accept that suspension of disbelief is required for any Dan Brown novel, but this one is beyond the pale.    To each their own of course, but I found this one to be terrible.
B002VECM6I|5.0|I go to see movies all the time while they are still in release.<br /><br />At this time of year we have high profile movie offerings like A Christmas Story, New Moon (same vampires), and the world coming to an end with 2012.  So. it's easy for this movie to get lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />It would have been so easy to miss this movie, and such a mistake to do so.  For, this is one of the best movies of the year, and one of the few I recommend whole heartedly.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock gives probably the best performance of her career, playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, a tough business like mom, who sees big Mike, a young oversized kid who never had a role model, and who never did well academically, because he had no reason to believe in himself.  He is the underdog we love to root for.<br /><br />The Tuohys take him in to their plush house, and we get drawn into the experience, perhaps sucked into this story might be a more apt description.  Yet Mike has a hidden gift which others like the sports coach can identify, and other teachers start to have faith in him, so who knows what will happen.<br /><br />If you're like me it's a movie about the importance of a mentor and believing in people, the more you believe in them the more they start to believe in themselves. If you like this one, I also recommend [[ASIN:B000G1R38U Akeelah and the Bee]], another five star movie.  In its first 14 days The Blind Side has done over $108 million at the box office, assuring that it will be one of the big hits of the year.<br /><br />While the Academy does not typically reward comedies with awards, Sandra Bullock may get a nomination, and so might the writers for best adapted screenplay, and she might win a Golden Globe  for her performance.<br /><br />A point of interest in the movie is Lily Collins daughter of Phil Collins who plays Sandra Bullock's daughter.<br /><br />Update, Jan 29, 2010. As she has now won the Golden Globe, which is a dress rehearsal for the Oscars, I expect she will get the Oscar nomination, and it sets the stage for an interesting contest with Meryl Streep for her performance in Julie and Julia. Both actresses played real life characters, with an interesting mix of drama and humor.  Although Oscars are not usually given for this type of performance, the exception is Marisa Tomei in [[ASIN:B000SFOW8I My Cousin Vinny]].  I predict this will be the year of the exception.  Streep has been nominated 15 times winning only twice.  This would be Bullocks first nomination.<br /><br />Update 2/3/2010. The Blind Side has been nominated for 2 Academy Awards, for Best Actress, and Best Picture. As of 2010 the Best Picture category has been expanded from 5 to 10 pictures, partly because of falling ratings, and partly because many popular movies have not historically received the same level of Oscar love, as movies such as The Blind Side has received from the public.<br /><br />Blind Side has grossed over $238 million dollars domestically, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of 2009, and no 63 all time for domestic box office, and it's still in release.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful to you, and I think you will enjoy the movie.eresting contest with Meryl Streep for her performance in Julie and Julia.

0439023483|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I read it in one day because I could not put it down.  It was engaging and the characters were interesting.  New things kept coming up in the book, like how people looked, new animals, new experiences, it was really interesting.  It reminded me a little of star wars, with the way the world was and the people in it.  I can not wait to get the second book and am ordering the authors other series.  Even though this is a young adult book, adults will love it (I'm 35).  Well written and is highly recommended.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Just an amazing voice and it sounds better on my Ipod than on TV.  I loved Daydream Believer, and How Great Thou Art as much as the title song.  I hope she releases more CDs soon.
B000002H70|5.0|Just to let you know about this new remastered version out in Spring 2010: it will sound better than this one which was released 20 years ago. The 2010 edition has been remastered at Abbey Road studios and will include rarities + extended version of Entreat.
1400063736|2.0|I was intially looking forward to reading this book but it fell short of what I was hoping it would be. I could not figure out what the son in Vietnam and him working on computers had anything to do with it. Am I missing something? I appreciate authors and the work they put into their stories but I just wasn't pleased when I finished the book. May try to read again.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Too many people are talking about how great the series is and not enough about the Blu Ray, so Ill try to keep it brief and do both<br /><br />First,<br /><br />ROME series is FANTASTIC, say that 5 times to yourself, there is not a better series or movie on ROME, PERIOD HBO went all out they went all out so much that it cost to much to maintain and they had to end it despite raving reviews.<br /><br />Second,<br /><br />BLU RAY looks FANTASTIC, worth the upgrade if you have it on DVD or the version to go with if you have none (I have both), The image is cleaner, smoother, better contrast, and looks like it was made for the world of HD<br /><br />Final Words<br /><br />Buy it, Now, and don't look back, ROME never looked so good
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Let me begin by saying that like many of you, I grew up watching Star Trek reruns in the 70s and loved the show. I saw all the later incarnations and all the movies and read many books and just loved the concept and the characters. I don't consider myself a Trekkie and don't speak Klingon or dress up funny either but I do consider myself a big fan of the series.<br /><br />Also, let me say that I thoroughly enjoy the TV series LOST created by JJ Abrams. It is revolutionary in its design and the characters and stories are amazingly great and I think Abrams and his creative team have made a wonderous show there.<br /><br />Now to the movie Star Trek...<br /><br />First of all, this is NOT really Star Trek at all. Oh sure they call it Star Trek and there is an Enterprise and Starfleet uniforms and even the original Mr. Spock, Leonard Nimoy, in the movie. But aside from those cosmetic window dressings this movie is primarily a JJ Abrams video game inspired piece of high octane drivel. C'mon the story is absurd to anyone with even a passing familiarity with Star Trek as many reviewers have noted! I mean having virtually the entire original crew with vastly different ages all at Starfleet Academy at the same time??? Helloooooo!! I mean how crazy is that? It is laughable. The Romulans? Looks too much like Star Trek: Nemesis when they had the sister planet of Romulas, Remus, as the source of the villains in huge menacing ships. I could go on with more examples but what would be the point?<br /><br />Simply put, this movie is a big budget action thriller designed to draw in a young audience who has no experience with Star Trek and to tread on the brand loyalty with the older viewers to exploit us all for big bucks to Paramount and to further JJ Abrams career. And if you watch the special feature called \\"New Vision\\" on the disc you will see how Abrams is portrayed almost like the next Steven Spielberg. It just comes off as a major ego stroking for JJ Abrams who seems happier reinventing the wheel with Star Trek rather than trying to make a Star Trek movie that was true to its original roots.<br /><br />To sum it up, if you want to see hot young actors and a lot of special effects and over the top action you will probably lick this up. But if you hoped to see something more thought provoking and true to the original show then you will be sadly disappointed.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because it is watchable and I suppose that is being generous on my part.Trek rather than trying to make a Star Trek movie that was true to its original roots.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|While Dan Brown's first three books I read were incredibly engaging for me, this one left me feeling a little bit like watching great previews and then being disappointed when I saw the movie.  It felt too much like National Treasure. The facts are intriguing and enjoyable to read about, but when I was reading it, it felt like Brown was reaching for a story to sell, instead of writing a great story that would sell anyway.  Maybe he's writing movie scripts now instead of novels. There just wasn't the character development and great plot line that the other books had. This is definately a book that didn't live up to the hype. It's better bought in the sale section after a nice discount.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|John Mayer is evolving into some different genres, shifting into folk and blues. I'd consider this album an interim effort and I'm expecting a masterwork the next CD.     There are some winners here. \\"Half of my Heart\\" it's smooth and bluesy.  \\"Who Says\\" which is the opener CD questions what our shoulds ought to be.   \\"Do you know me\\" opens beautifully and just makes you want to know more.      \\"Crossroads\\" ala Eric Clapton and Cream, is one of the two serious mis-steps on Mayer's part.  Mayer's lost the soul of the original masterwork--this is one I am programming to SKIP every time it comes around. The second \\"All we ever do is say good-bye\\" isn't so much of a mis-step but too much repetition for my taste.     So, in this reviewer's opinion, the CD is hit or miss. Other fans may like what I do not. \\"Battle Studies\\" is definitely listenable and I believe Mayer's next work will be brilliant as he eases into the new genre.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2009
B001FB55HQ|1.0|I agree with everyone else here.  I call this an EPIC fail!  The sad part is, I own a PS3 and STILL won't buy this in protest!  I find it very offensive that only Blu Ray customers get the Director's Cut.

0553385461|4.0|A Briefer History of Time, by Stephen Hawking was an interesting book summarizing many of the advances and discovers that have come to be understood only by educated physicists now available to merely everyone. Difficult concepts such as time, theory of relativity, space-time, energy, quantum mechanics, time travel, etc. were discussed. The book allowed for so much of the advanced knowledge that has been gained in the last centuries to be succinctly abridged into just as the title implies a \\"briefer history of time\\".                   The author of the book taught difficult concepts that astronomer's, physicists, and scientists faced then and now and he taught it in such a way that \\"non-science\\" coordinated people could grasp. The many difficult equations and figures that usually accompany physics were not used which caused the daunting task of learning about the ever-expanding universe and the way it works easier to swallow. Hawking was very good at taking deeper thought and theory and teaching it so even a struggling college physic student could better understand the world of physics.                 The book itself was very well written. It made available the less understood concepts of the world of physics. A few of the concepts flew pretty far over my head. Over all, however I felt that it allowed me to gain a better understanding about how much there still to know about our universe. The little bit we do know is just so small when comparing the deep universe still unknown.
1881273156|5.0|So before writing this review, I read a bunch of the one star reviews and was really shocked at some things.  Yes, it is a \\"christian\\" self help book, but it's not as bad as some were saying.  I guess if you have such a closed mind and you can't simply overlook/skim past any biblical/Jesus references, then this book may not be for you.  I actually got this book from the library after searching for marriage self help books and it is currently on my wish list.  I personally am fascinated by the \\"why we do what we do\\" reasons for how we relate to people, etc. and this was no exception.  It was fascinating to me to learn what my love language is and was very thought provoking.  At the back of the book, Dr. Chapman has a test to find out your love language and I was even more intrigued when my husband took it.  It created some great discussion about how he was raised vs. how I was raised.  But seriously, if your one reaon for not buying this book is b/c you don't like \\"christianity\\" being \\"littered\\" into your self help book, check it out at the library...and try to look past it and get the real reason of the book.  Understanding your spouse better...and yourself.

B001FB55HQ|4.0|Ok. Finally a good movie of 2009. Ironic that the dvd itself is weak. The crappy Transformers sequel and Star Trek movies get great treatment but this excellent movie does not???    Anyway.....    This movie is excellent. Great story of redemption. The character Marcus is a death row inmate then changes and becomes hero to mankind, saving John Connor in the end. He gets his second chance at life.  There are many great nods to the other movies. You see how John Connor gets his scar seen in the very first movie. You see the T-800s as they come out of the factories(has the Arnold look), great touch to the 1984 movie.  There is lots of action too and many different versions of the enemy, from snake like to King Kong sized to the evil looking T-600s.  I reccomend this to any Terminator fan.  4 stars for the actual movie and 1 star for the poor dvd release. This was the best action movie of the 2009 summer.   No crude sex jokes or complete insult to the franchise.  Just great sci fi action.  This won't disappoint.
B0026P3G12|5.0|When I first saw the array of songs on her CD, (a Christmas carol, old hymns, old jazz)I was puzzled because it seemed as if the producers didn't know what genre to pick for the album. Then I listened to it and I understood they were selecting songs to show off her stunning vocal range and to set a precedent for her next work. I liked the arrangements very much, because they didn't have the techno-glitz that we all get tired of on every album, but the simplier arrangements that showcased her true talent and let her voice shine. I think this is one reason so many people love her, as she is so genuine and not another corporately-manufactured pseudo-talent that we are so tired of. She is original. She puts heart into her songs and I think that is another thing we all love about her. The song \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\" made me cry (and I missed my freeway exit!) because it seemed to be about her achieving her life's dream. Her millions of fans are so happy that this seemingly ordinary woman was able to let her incredible hidden talent shine on the world. At times I felt her voice was restrained, as if a vocal coach was telling her to ease off, or maybe trying to let us hear how beautiful her softer voice is. She has such vocal power that I'd like to see more of it on her next album, and I'd like to hear more Broadway tunes because I think that genre fits her voice and interpretation very well. The album has nice graphics too, great photos of Susan that really seem to protrait the real woman. The only downside to this album was that the volume was different between songs and I had to adjust it. Otherwise, this album rates a 9 for me.

0307266303|5.0|I downloaded this book on my iphone, partly because I was trying out Kindle for iphone and partly because I love these kinds of books -- true adventure stories.  I can't really add anything more, since so many positive reviews have been submitted, but I will say, I rarely find a book these days that I can't put down.  Chris McDougall writes with a wry, humorous voice and tells a compelling story.  I highly recommend it.
0061914177|4.0|I purchased this book without reading any reviews and I'm glad I did.  It certainly looks like many of the 5-star reviews are hype related.  On the other hand I certainly feel the 1-2 star reviews are completely unjustified.<br /><br />Here's why.  There's no doubt that Gary's methods are unique to him.  Kind of a love-hate thing.  I love him!  Straight to the point and providing useful, actionable information that he feels will actually help his readers become a success in their passion.  He's done it, lived it and is currently living it.  I don't know how you can criticize someone for that.  The reason I didn't make this a 5-star review is because I would have liked Gary to talk more about finding your passion.  The target market for this book are people that have a strong desire to be successful but they often times chase one dream after another because they don't know their passion or exactly what they want to do.  So they bounce around from opportunity to opportunity.  My concern is that a lot of people will absolutely love this book, because its that good, but then not take action because their passion is designing yard signs but they have bills to pay.  Sure the can work till 3:00 AM while working their day job to pay the bills but how long can someone realistically do that?  Overall I totally agree with Gary in that if you work your passion its not working at all.  But for most people its easier said than done.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is this: I am a better person by reading this book.  It has opened my mind and allowed for new, fresh ideas to consume me.  I highly recommend this book.
B0026P3G12|5.0|It is so rare that a person comes along who exhibits a natural aptitude for one thing. There are pilots who are inspired to excellance through their God given natural talents. This is the realm of Susan Boyle. I knew the first time I was privaliged to hear her singing that here was a natural talent, not assisted by any manipulation of technology. Her voice is awe inducing and hypnotizing. I could listen endlessly. I would love to meet her but am content with hearing her sing. It is absolutly mezmirizing. I look forward to future albums and consider myself one of her biggest fans. Anyone who can listen to her and not be engulfed in the sound could not appreciate the purity of the human singing voice. As far as I am concerned she is on the level of a Strisand, a Billie Holliday, a Celine Dion, all combined.

0525457585|5.0|Fans of the 1980s film version of Michael Ende's NeverEnding Story will love this book - although they may be surprised to find that the movie tells only half the tale.    The NeverEnding Story is a book within a book: it begins with the story of Bastian, a lonely school-age boy who picks up \\"The NeverEnding Story\\" in an old bookstore. As Bastian begins to read, the story shifts back and forth between a fantasy novel about a hero's quest to save the dying world of Fantastica, and Bastian's own somewhat parallel feelings. The film follows the first half of the book fairly closely - but it ends when Bastian enters Fantastica, while the second half of the novel is just beginning. The rest of the story features even more extraordinary magical beings and locations, as Bastian struggles to balance the best and worst aspects of power and to find his true self.    A fabulous tale, beautifully written and perfect for reading out loud. Full of imaginative lands like the Desert of Colors and the lake of tears, as well as unforgettable characters like the old man of wandering mountain and the foolish former emporers who've forgotten themselves.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The series is top notch and only gets better with each episode. It feels like Sopranos on wheels and leather. All and all a great show. As far as the DVD, the package leaves a lot to be desired. Fortunately, what's inside more than makes up for it.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I am definitely not a pro photographer... more \\"enthusiastic amateur\\". That means I can't comment on the more advanced features that many other reviewers have called out. What I can say is that I use this with my D300 and have got exceptional results. Some key points for me:    *  It is very powerful, giving great illumination at night and it also gives great control for fill shots.  *  Very easy to use, and to learn new techniques  *  The diffuser that comes with the unit really makes a difference without having to buy additional accessories.  *  I have had no issue with the thermal shutdown problem mentioned by other reviewers  *  After reading other reviews, I use Eneloop batteries with this flash and get great battery life and recycle times  *  It's very big, but I suppose that it's height at least gets the light further away from the lens (when mounted on the camera shoe)    Expensive, but highly recommended

B00192KCQ0|1.0|I'm a long-time Metallica fan.  You can't beat the triumvirate of Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and And Justice for All.  And unlike some fans, I think the Black Album was an incredible piece of creative work which helped push the progressive metal genre.  And Load and Reload, while having a lot of forgettable garbage (including most of the \\"popular\\" songs), also had a few gems.  But Metallica is over the hill and going downhill.  The music just isn't that tight anymore.  It doesn't all sync up and sound cohesive.  It's not a matter of getting back to their '80s sound, it's a matter of having a good ear for music again.  And the vocals are increasingly strained.  It's not just the new songs, but even doing their old stuff, James just doesn't have it anymore.  He's too monotone in an annoying resonance.  There's no longer the crispness and vocal range he had a few decades younger, even in purely thrash titles where you wouldn't think it would matter that much.  Listen to a recent live performance of Enter Sandman (a selection they often do live) versus the recorded version or an old live version and the difference in vocals is stark.  I really wish it weren't so, but people do get old and they do lose their edge.  Metallica is now like Michael Jordan playing for the Wizards.  It's time to hang up the guitars.  You should have gone out while on top.  Now it's just getting sad.  Why not sponsor and support an up-and-coming group and pass the baton?  I can't recommend wasting your money on their most recent albums.

0142000671|3.0|It is quite depressing to read this novel, but I guess it is a good introduction to American culture, or the lack of it. For example, if you are an Indian immigrant, coming from a fairy tale land of Buddha and Gandhi and you find it hard to understand predatory nature of American corporate culture, this is a novel that will give you a glimpse of \\"American way of life.\\". I think one should read these books before one starts to dream about migrating to America. Otherwise the reality shock that one gets after living and working in a private corporation in the USA will be not only surprising but also painful.<br /><br />Steinback has tried to condense as much possible in as few pages as possible and it has kind of dramatized the story too much. But I agree with Steinback in his depiction of the American way of life. The strong trying to prey on the weak. This is what has always happened in America from day one. From Native Americans that were the first victim of white lust to the today's common man in America who is nothing but a unit of production in the capitalistic system, it is always the weak that have been used by the strong. The masks have changed, but exploiter and exploited always continue to exist and the American dream is for the exploited to think that one day he will be the exploiter.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|This is alot of 70s guitar music fans go to CD. It certainly is mine.I pick the best of my favorites and sometimes go through a number of CDs to find it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This lady is better than good, she is GREAT.  First singer that has ever brought tears to my old eyes and sent chills through me. She is one of the OUTSTANDING TALENTS of her generation.  In my 66 years of living she is the best I've heard and made songs I've heard many times come alive with real meaning.  Anyone who isn't touched by  some song on this album is totally out of touch with living life.  Funny how you realise how you have missed hearing real talent until you hear it again.  Sing on Susan!!!!!!!!
B00009UTQD|5.0|Was exactly what I needed. No more fumbling with clamshell cases - I can easily organize these for quick accesss. When not on my belt the pouch stays on the camera bag strap. The only thing that would make it better is if the back strap could be attached for vertical or horizontal strap attachments.
B0015DROBO|5.0|From start to finish this is an inventive, thrilling read. It's depressing that there will only be three books in the series due to the authors untimely death. I can imagine this as a movie = but it is best to make your own movie in your mind. A must read!
0064410935|5.0|When I read this as a 4th grader, I didn't see half the insights and life's lessons that I did as I grew up. Maybe I did, but just didn't see it the same way, Either way, this book is a gem to introduce young readers into partaking into reading for pleasure. My 4th grade teacher would read a 1/2 hour to us after lunch every other day, and she chose both E.B. White's classics, including \\"Stuart Little.\\" But \\"Charlotte's Web\\" at such a young age left such a lump in my throat, that when sick from school for a week, my mom gave in to my pleas for buying me that book. Felt like a celebrity when I returned to school w/ that book in hand-like George Kennedy's character in Cool Hand Luke with Newman's picture w/ some ladies. I had something everyone else in class wanted. Even got some chocolate milk offers to borrow it! All in all, this book evokes some great memories, not just of the story told, but how such books can form one's life, in this case my desire to read more. This book stands above all other children's books in my lifetime. It's an easy, wonderful read for kids of all ages.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|Taking Woodstock is one of the most underated films of the year.      the texture, the composition, the entire film is amazing.     it captures the essence of the period perfectly.    I loved the film. I believe, you will too, with an open heart.
B000002KFJ|3.0|To say this album was the beginning of Sabbath's decline isn't so much an insult to this CD as it is a salute to the superb previous 4 albums. But this CD didn't have the same themes and era to flourish like the band's earlier material. The early 70s (even late 60s) gave bands more themes to feed on-war, pollution, politics, etc.-that by comparison, when you got to CDs like Sabotage, the themes seemed a bit scattered, and the music followed it as a result. This is the last album that still had a dark edge to it, the very essence of Black Sabbath. Though not as much edge. That would decline further in future recordings when like other bands, Sabbath felt a need to ruin a perfectly good formula by adding even more pointless keyboards. But with an opening attack of \\"Hole in the Sky, \\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\" and \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" Sabbath still proved capable of delivering a good opening punch on their records. While \\"Thrill of it All\\" and \\"The Writ\\" still maintained remnants of their more sinister sounding material. I felt \\"Supertzar\\" was a song waiting to be delivered by the likes of Sabbath-a real horror movie soundtrack sounding tune. This isn't a bad CD. Just not as solid as its predecessors. Keyboards tossed into a song or 2 needlessly and scattered direction, relatively speaking just made this  CD a little less palatable. It didn't measure up to my beginning to end listenings of the first 4 Sabbath CDs, and that says something to me. After this CD keyboards would be utilized even more liberally (Technical Ecstasy, for eg.), making this the last Sabbath CD I was actually passionate about. This CD has some real high points. Just not as many as before.

0307266303|5.0|If you run, read this book.  I've been running off and on for 35 years.  I'm 63 and just getting back into it after a couple months off for a knee injury that wouldn't go away.  Surgery not an option.  After reading this book I, and I'm sure many runners, realized we were running the wrong way with the wrong shoes.  I've since changed my form to match the optimum ultra runner form described in the book.  Funny, I can't walk on my knee without slight pain but I can run on it using this ancient, (and natural) form and old tech. shoes with no pain at all.  The book is illuminating for runners who've been at it for a while and have had injury after injury.  Being told by \\"running shoe experts\\" and shoe corporations that their new 100 + $ shoe would cure all ills.  Seems exactly the opposite is true.  I loved this book.  Read it in 3 days and wished it would have gone on longer.  The characters are out of Central Casting in Hollywood and a hoot to be introduced to.  Again, if you run read this book.
B002OR18HQ|5.0|John Fogerty has some fine musicians with him on this new DVD as you will clearly hear.I highly recommend it and the price was right.     I saw John Fogerty in 1986 at Riverbend Music Center where he did not sing any CCR tunes.Even so that was one of the best concerts I have been to.   I saw him again in late 90`s where he preformed solo and CCR tunes.That was another great show.     I prefer the studio version of Born On The Bayou and most CCR tunes to any of the live recordings.I will say Fogerty`s voice was strong on Fortunate Son and the other CCR tunes covered on this live DVD.I have Fogerty`s other live videos and I was glad to hear some different CCR songs in this concert.    John Fogerty is not an oldies act he is still comes up with some great songs,just listen to this DVD version of *Somebody Help Me.     I have to add as far as Rock-A-Billy or Country Fogerty does it his way.     Someone mentioned the documentary is not included on this DVD for some reason and that`s true.This may be for the best.Because every documentary I have ever seen on John Fogerty and CCR seemed to dwell on the problems the band had in the latter years.
B002DKF47O|5.0|This is my first Behemoth album since there was so much good word surrounding this release. I dont usually listen to black metal im more of death and thrash metal guy because all the make up and battle axes put me off. But im glad i got into this band i love its brutality. A lot of peopla are saying best metal of 2009, i'm almost conviced it might be...
B002HWRYJE|2.0|The movie from the point of view or context of the \\"real\\" Star Trek world is a disaster.  The characters had different premises, values and demeanors. They had no rapport with each other and absolutely none with the audience.  By the way were those supposed to be Romulans? I mean Romulans can be mistaken for Vulcans..right?...well not in this movie.  Here the Romulans looked like rejects from the WWF.  Over the past 45 years a detailed and integrated Star Trek world has evolved.  It is premised on the Gene Roddenberry creation that was brought to life within the context of his vision of the world of the future.  Writers, directors and actors have developed and added to this world incrementally, but always within the Star Trek vision and context. This movie has nothing to do with that context...well yes in a way as some of the characters do have the names we all know, but that is pretty much it.  The context of the Star Trek world has either been ignored or absolutely shredded. The characters, their backgrounds, their relationships--none of it makes coherent sense.  The effort here, has been to make an action movie for a less pensive and reflective audience.  Anything beyond elements which contribute to the action scenes has been given only cursory attention. I remember some time back there was on television the second of Bob Newhart's comedy series; it was named \\"Newhart.\\" In it he owned and ran an Inn.  Those who are old enough (or watch reruns) may well remember his first comedy series called the \\"Bob Newhart Show\\"; in it he played a psychologist.  Both of these shows were quite well received.  In the last episode of the latter show ( \\"Newhart\\") he awakens from a dream and he is back in the original \\"Bob Newhart Show.\\"  It was a clever way to end the second series.  It was as if the last 8 or 9 years had never occurred--all that had happened during those years had been a dream.  I mention this for one reason; there will no doubt be another Star Trek movie.  I sincerely hope the opening  scene shows Spock on his home planet, waking up with an almost emotional and confused look on his face, he walks to a window, he sees his beautiful home planet stretched out in front of him, shakes his head and says \\"ah...I must have experienced what humans term a nightmare.\\" Then we will all know this movie was just a sci fi hoax, a joke, and after a mild laugh we can sit back and enjoy a \\"real\\" Star Trek Adventure.  Honestly except for the action scenes and the special effects, which were spectacular nothing really worked in the movie.
B002QEXN2K|2.0|Ok let me start with ... I love John Mayers music.   I loved everything from the beginning. I went to every concert that I could.   I have every CD, I have every live recording.     But how incredibly plain is this CD?   I don't even know how some of these songs can \\"grow on me\\" cause there is nothing to grow on. No melodies, no fun, no jokes. Is that how you he expects to go no1 and fill the stadiums? really?     Well I am truly happy that I did not buy the tickets for his show yet.     \\"Who says I can't get stoned?\\"   Well John you sure can, but your music does not benefit from it.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I'm not going to review the film itself here because I think the Underworld trilogy is ace. However this particular DVD version did not impress me much. The picture seems murky and so does the audio. It looks like a bad DVD rip, to be honest. In addition the subtitles are big and blocky; not very pleasing to the eye on a larger HD screen.<br />I guess I couldn't expect more at that price.
0893860220|5.0|This book can be opened anywhere, read for a few minutes, and you will delight in the gentle, loving, human, profound and sometimes humourous responses of this simple sage, who took his own master's words to heart and went deeply into himself to realize that he was himself one with the absolute, and that beyond our ignorance of this fact, we are also that.  A book to keep at your bedside and reread when needed, for a quick boost into reality, which as he says in so many ways, is itself beyond all words.  Precious and priceless book.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I just ordered Susan Boyle's cd a bit ago and I can't wait to listen to it. I, along with millions of others, saw her on the talent show and was absolutely blown away by what I was hearing! What a beautiful voice!! I believe she could sing any type of music and be a success. I would love for her to sing some classical pieces as well as more hymns. God bless you, Susan, and may wonderful things come your way!
B002YMXF5Y|5.0|Kurt Sutter and more. This is a great season of S2. I'll buy S1 and S2 asap. Worth a watch but not for kiddos. This is a mature audiences show that will keep you waiting for ea new show and season. The male ego, heart, and life styles are collected in one place. Awesome watch!
B00005N6KG|1.0|I knew they were a cheap pair of headphones, but they cut out in one ear the first time I used them.  Save your money and get a good pair!  I liked the style and the over the head, but if they don't work, then it's pointless.
B000PC6Z48|4.0|Another American reviewer once accurately referred to Sergio Corbucci's Django as disappointing to an audience accustomed to the better-known works of Sergio Leone.    That said, Django is still an excellent, very original Spaghetti western with several memorable and iconic scenes: Django dragging his coffin, prostitutes fighting each other in the mud, the forced removal of a man's ear (referenced in Resevoir Dogs).  Django is not up to par with the Dollars trilogy or Once Upon a Time in the West but is nevertheless recommended for any true fan of the genre.    This DVD contains both the original Italian and horrenously-dubbed English versions.  The English dubbing truly is awful and should be eschewed in favor of the more natural Italian dialogue with English subtitles.
B002QH2NUA|1.0|Big Paul fan, was at one of the NYC shows, have seen the fan-flimed clips on YouTube....and I will never watch this DVD or listen to the CD again, once was enough.  The use of auto-tune on Paul's vocals is just ridiculous - he sounds mechanized, synthesized, processed - you pick the term.  Very disappointed in Paul and his team, he should be above this.  I have read comments saying Paul's engineer denies the use of auto-tune - does he not realize we have ears!!!  Please.
B00000I0XW|5.0|I'm a Sarah Brightman fan and looked forward to her interpretations of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.  It's a great album, ranging from the ethereal \\"Piu Jesu\\" to the gritty \\"Don't Cry For Me\\" and Sir John Gielgud's spoken lyrics.  As I listen to her duet with Jose Carreras, I find myself wondering why she never collaborated with Placido Domingo.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I have to admit that I did not purchase after listening to the previews of all the songs. The only one that spoke to me was \\"Cry Me a River,\\" possibly because I could actually hear Susan's voice. She has wonderful phrasing and musicality in this cut, making me hope that her next CD will be in a jazz format. I agree with another reviewer who thought the music too big and loud which forces Susan to push her voice too hard. Yes, I still like \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" but didn't you think the accompanying orchestration just a bit much? She has a sweeter voice when she doesn't force herself to sing too loudly. Great potential!
0307269752|2.0|Having finished the book, I'm frustrated. The story is interesting, compelling - even riveting at times. However the writing style is despairingly bad. It's more than simply being a translation problem.<br /><br />The text is filled with nauseating and unnecessary details. While some writers paint luscious and vivid scenes by using rich descriptive language, Larsson simply bores. Although this is an action novel, it's written in the past tense, destroying any sense of immediacy to the action. The book is also filled with thinly veiled attempts of Larsson pushing his own social agenda and opinions onto the reader. While Larsson supports admirable causes, his descriptions of the abuse of individuals with mental health problems, the causes for under-reporting of rape, racism and the fundamental evilness of the stock market simply feels forced into the story for the sake discussing these socials problems. Finally Larsson gratuitously fills the book with technical references that make the book feel dated. The constant references to Apple hardware largely feel like product placements. A significant portion of the plot centers around \\"hacking\\" - unfortunately the technical description is disturbingly inaccurate and does not correspond to reality. Omitting the technical discussions would have made for a better book.<br /><br />While this book might be an interesting starting point for a movie script, it fails to qualify as good literature and as a pleasant read.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|OK - So much has been written, but I picked this up yesterday and after hearing the mono version released 20+ years ago, this remastered stereo version has PUNCH.  I mean the bass drums & tom-toms KABOOM.  The rhythm guitar playing has never been this clear.  Track 4, Happy Just To Dance With You, was the cleanest.  It could have been recorded the other day.    I have a new appreciation for the recording techniques employed back then.    Great album, much improved sound and all for the low, low price.    Do you think you know this album?  I thought I did until yesterday afternoon when I was in my car listening again.  When I play it in my home system I expect to be amazed again.
B002MRROKS|4.0|This DVD/CD set is a must for any music fan, not just of  Nirvana or even the grunge era. Tracks from In Utero in their embryonic stage (pun intended), lyrics not yet in place and an odd, actually up-beat bass line on All Apologies. Tourettes (\\"the eagle has landed\\") is the same version on Live from the muddy banks of Wishkah. As a Nirvana fan I once again enjoy \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" because on this DVD you witnessed the band before the song alienates even them. As expected you can witness the devistation of all musical equipment on stage for the \\"climax\\" if you will. The CD is good, but the DVD is excellent. After the credits on the DVD you get a behind the sceens look @ Kurt Cobain with a young fan which was touching to see.
B002JODV3S|5.0|To make a long review short, if you are a fan of Steve Vai then this is a must buy! I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was shot in the State Theater in downtown Minneapolis, I'm from St. Paul so I thought that was pretty neat. This is a great venue with awesome acoustics so if you have a nice sound setup you will greatly enjoy this one. The only downfall (which isnt really one in my opinion) is that it was shot in 720p and not 1080p. Oh well, it still looks and sounds fantastic! Enjoy!
B002RV01Q8|5.0|Both the jewel-box CD Edition and the hard-cover book-bound CD/DVD Editions have a previously unreleased version  of \\"Aniron\\" from \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\". The soundtrack CD had a version just over 2 minutes, and this new collection has  a recording that is about 30 seconds longer and has more of a familiar Enya studio-sound, as opposed to pure orchestral.   In the liner notes, Enya refers to it has the \\"previously unavailable full version\\". \\"Aniron\\" had never been on an   Enya album in any form.    Both editions share many of her popular hits, but there are major differences in the tracks included,   with the CD having 19 songs, and the CD on the CD/DVD edition having 22, many of them different.    Included on the regular CD, but missing from the CD portion of the CD/DVD version:   Storms In Africa, Book Of Days, The Celts, Water Shows The Hidden Heart, Cursum Perficio, Aldebaran,   A Day Without Rain, and Oiche Chiuin (Chorale).   (2 of those - The Celts and Storms In Africa - do appear in video form on the DVD)  In their place on the CD portion of the CD/DVD are 11 songs that are not on the regular CD edition,  including the beautiful Stars And Midnight Blue, Drifting, Fallen Embers, and Athair Ar Neamh.   So the 2 sets are very different in the audio portion, with the regular jewel-box CD edition  being more of a concise \\"greatest hits\\", and the CD/DVD being more in depth and featuring some less familiar  tracks along with most of the hits. The order in which the songs are presented is also completely different,   with the CD/DVD edition audio being mostly in reverse chronological order, and the CD edition being somewhat random.    The CD/DVD Edition is the very first release on DVD (in the USA) of most of Enya's videos.  The DVD also includes the documentary \\"Enya: A Life In Music\\", and \\"Making Of\\" specials about 2 of her videos,  Caribbean Blue and Only Time.    The CD/DVD packaging is excellent; a hard-cover book filled with both familiar and new photos of Enya, notes  by Enya, Roma Ryan, and Nicky Ryan, and pockets to hold the CD and DVD, housed in a glossy slipcase.    One surprising omission (from both the CD and CD/DVD versions) is the hit \\"Only If...\\"   from the CD \\"Paint The Sky With Stars - The Best Of Enya\\" (1997), which is now out-of-print in the USA.   It was also missing from the \\"Enya Collection\\" box set in 2002.  It does appear, however, in video form on the DVD.    In either edition, this is an excellent overview of Enya's incredible music to date.

B001GQSY5K|1.0|This movie was, is and always will be the worst movie in the Star Wars Saga.  This mountain of a terd should have been created.  Ok CGI is not bad but the story does not follow the events that happened in the movies or books.  Don't bother with this !
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I know it wasn't as good as the series, but I was fully expecting that so I wasn't disappointed. It was just a different experience and it was good seeing how the characters had progressed. The series was one of the best so it's understandable why some people didn't care as much for this movie. However, it was still very good and I really look forward to the next one.
B002T45VX6|4.0|Its a very good Cd, i like most of the songs and its an easy listen... but... Look, i am a huge Shakira Fan, loved Donde estan los Ladrones, Laundry Service, Oral Fixation 1 and 2, heard the cds a million times, know the songs, in conclusion my favorite cds. It just good, for shakira im used to music being better, im not listening to this cd as much as i hoped, and a lot of good music is coming out these days, im afraid She Wolf pales in comparison to Timbaland for example.    But its a good CD, different wich is good (I am kind of annoyed that people say: \\"This isnt Shakira, go back to Pies Descalzos\\", come on people, if she did another Pies Descalzos o Ladrones, everyone would say \\"She doesnt try anything diferent\\", i like her experimenting, the results is good and fun music).     Most shakira fans will like it.    Favorite songs:  Loba  Spy  Long Time  Give it up to me  Men in this town.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Celtic Music - My blood stirs. I am an American, but I reckon it's my 50% Scotch-Irish heritidge.<br /><br />I was first introduced to M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Nesbitt's fiddle and voice in an album entitled \\"Celtic Women\\" (one of the Clancy women was also featured) that predates this album/video by several years.  The entry was a kids song, D&uacute;laman, (about a vegetable per the album song info) sung entirely in Celtic by M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad.<br /><br />I also have the audio CD. The DVD proves the quartet's looks match their sound.  All are beautiful singers.
B000002KAT|5.0|Astral Weeks, Van Morrison's seminal 1968 album has been praised by musicians and writers from Lester Bangs to Bruce Springsteen. Known previously for his role as the singer in the Irish rock and blues band, Them, Van Morrison has helped define rock and roll with such hits as 'Gloria' and 'Here Comes The Night'. On Astral Weeks he abandons his pop sensibilities and amplified sound in exchange for a more 'rootsy' and organic vibe. The long lasting success of this album demonstrates that Van's songwriting is timeless and has appeal for all listeners of all generations. I would recommend this album to any fan of Van's solo music or the music of his previous band Them.
0739368044|4.0|There is good evolution in this story, which flows from the previous books Eldest, and Eragon.  I do not want to give the story away - there are pleasant and sad surprises. Eragon now has a tool for defeating the evil king Galbatorix. I believe the book could have moved a little quicker sans elaborate and sometimes bloated descriptions. Paolini is gifted - However, I pray Paolini concludes this saga soon (Wasn't this entry to be the finale? The four stars reflect my disappointment).<br /><br />I reckon I will have to wait until the next novel for a conclusion. Regardless, this is good listening on a long trip - especially if you're the passenger ;-) (For continuity, my wife and I like listening to any of the many audio series on long car trips).
0385504225|4.0|I would say I am surprised that so many people have been writing negative reviews of this novel and saying that they find it dissapointing when compared to the Da Vinci Code, but given the hype of the Da Vinci Code I think this is to be expected. If you were expecting the secomd coming of...well...you know, then this novel probably would dissapoint you. But just like Angels & Demons and the Da Vinci Code, the Lost Symbol is simply a great thriller written by an author who is an expert at hooking you from page 1 so that you keep turning the pages.     Now is this the greatest book ever? No, it is not. Is it a little silly and over the top at times? Yes, but so are his other books. But as far as thrillers go, The Lost Symbol is about as good as it gets. Shakespeare this is not, but a great \\"beach read\\" it is.     I am not going to analyze all the plot details, but I will say that I found it refreshing that the action took place in the United States this time. Maybe I found it more interesting since I attended school in DC, but still, the fact that it took place out of Europe made it feel at least a little different then the two prior Robert Langdon novels. And the main bad guy in this novel is a REALLy bad guy. I thought Angels & Demons and Da Vinci Code were both really bad movie adaptions as they were dull and so workmenlike, but if they cast the right actor to play the part of the heavy in the eventual adaption of the Lost Symbol, they will be going a long way to assuring it's the best movie adaption of these novels. Also, I can usually spot the predictable \\"reveal\\" or surprise at the end, but this book's reveal did take me by surprise.     My only gripe is that after the big reveal and conclusiin of the main plot, the book keeps going for another 30 pages of explanations that felt a little extraneous.     So I would recommend this book easily if you liked Dan Brown's prior novels, especially Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code. But if you keep your expectationsrealistic and just go in expecting a really good thriller and nothing more, you will most likely enjoy this novel very much.

B000NQRE0K|5.0|I recently purchased Braveheart on Blu-Ray from Amazon during their Black Friday sale. When I watched the film, I was blown away by how beautiful the movie is in high definition. I usually cannot tell much of a difference on my television(37\\" Olevia with 1080i and hdmi cables) between up-scaled standard and high definition. However, while watching this movie, I was blown away at how wonderful this movie looks. While certainly no slouch on DVD, this movie in HD is a sight to behold. The colors are vibrant and the detail is extraordinary, especially in the outdoor scenes.  The movie itself is excellent. It practically swept the Academy Awards in 1995 and made millions and millions of dollars. Of course it isn't entirely historically accurate, but if I want historically accurate, I'll watch the History Channel. If you haven't seen this movie, you are in for a treat.  Another reason to get this would be the manufacturer's rebate for people who own the DVD version. If you send in the proof of purchase tab from both the DVD and Blu-Ray, as well as the form inside the case and your receipt, they will send you a ten dollar check. I think it expires around June of 2010. However, I'm not very keen on cutting up my cover insert, so I'll have to call Paramount and see if there is a way around this.   There is a second disc of extras, though most of it is rehashed from earlier releases. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie. No Blu-Ray collection is complete without it!
0920668372|1.0|I really have to agree with the other reviewers who deemed this book as creepy and a little bit frightening.  In all honesty, I cannot imagine why this book was even published! Even more, why? WHY? WHY???? do readers not see that an old woman driving to her adult son's home with a LADDER on the roof of her car so that she can CLIMB INTO HIS BEDROOM WINDOW in the middle of the night to cradle him and watch him sleep isn't really weird (not to mention physically impossible)?  It makes me wonder whether this was actually a joke which was mistaken for something serious, like the song \\"The Leader of the Pack,\\" or the radio broadcast of \\"The War of the Worlds.\\"  Anyone have info about this theory?  I received this book as a gift by a well-meaning grandmother, but if went into the trash bin after the first reading.  Please spend your money on something worthwhile.
0312370849|3.0|Interesting premise, and a different event in Holocaust history, but the book was a little light.  The last 30-40 pages I was begging it to be over, skimming through.  I don't think this one is worth the hype, but a good light read.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I really liked this film. It's the best Marvel Comics movie yet. As a long time comic book fan, I find this movie fascinating for how it combines elements of the original comics with new takes on the character, all to perfectly capture his essence.<br /><br />Iron Man first appeared in 1963. Stan Lee who created the character and wrote his early adventures makes no secret of the fact that Tony Stark was originally based on Howard Hughes. I'm not talking the later, paranoid, mentally unhinged, obsessively germophobic, hasn't-trimmed-his-fingernails-or-taken-bath-in-five years Howard Hughes, I'm talking the young, amazingly good looking, high-level genius, kinda-looks-ike-Errol-Flynn-and-bonks-any-gorgeous-Hollywood-starlet-he-wants-to Howard Hughes.<br /><br />The early parts of the movie pretty much follow the 1963 origin. While in a foreign country supporting the American war effort (in 1963 it was Vietnam and doing a field review of Stark-designed weapons' performance, in 2008 it's updated to the War on Terror and hawking the Jericho missile system), Tony Stark is severely wounded in an explosion, a piece of shrapnel lodged near his heart that will in weeks work itself inward and kill him. Imprisoned with Professor Yinsen (originally Vietnamese, natch, in the movie not) they work together to free themselves from the evil warlord who has imprisoned them both. Tony builds an armored chest plate that will keep the shrapnel from piercing his heart, and around that he and Yinsen design and build a crude suit of armor, somewhat paradoxically inset with all the cutting edge technological weaponry that a high-level genius intellect, feverishly battling for freedom and against death, can invent when pushed to the edge under incredible time pressure. Tony uses the first, bulky, prototype Iron Man armor to escape but Yinsen dies in the attempt.<br /><br />Stan Lee always felt that every good hero, no matter how powerful, should have a counterbalancing weakness. In Tony's case it's the damage to his heart, and the irony (pun intended) that the Iron Man armor (or at least the chest plate of same) is not just there to be his superheroic identity, it's a necessity to keep him alive. Tony can never take off the chest plate, he has to wear it constantly, hidden under his clothes when not Iron Man, openly when he is. Eventually this goes away when Tony's damaged heart is removed and replaced with a cybernetic heart of his own design. Overtones of the Wizard of Oz's Tin Man without a heart do occur to me.<br /><br />But...I get ahead of myself. Back to the early comic books, and the movie's storyline.<br /><br />When Tony returns to the world, in short order, having seen and felt the ravages of war up-close and personal, he terminates Stark Industries' production of war materiel. Up til this point, the movie is pretty much a well-produced updating of the original story.<br /><br />The rest of the movie skips ahead and pillages ideas from Iron Man stories of decades later, specifically Iron Man's conflict with Obadiah Stane who starts out as Stark's business rival and eventually dons a set of armor called Iron Monger to become Tony's armored antagonist. (Iron Man is always at his best when he's battling high-tech armored villains with suits to pit against his own.) In the movie Stane is recast as Tony's business partner and paternal figure after his own father's death.<br /><br />We do skip in the movie the iterations of Iron Man armor between the first gray suit and the most current versions which are visually based on Japanese samurai armor, very techno-geek manga-esque. In particular we skip the sleek design that Stark wore longer than any other suit, and for me has always been THE classic Iron Man.<br /><br />Pepper Potts was an early cast member who then disappeared for decades before eventually being reintegrated into the Iron Man mythos. James Rhodes (Rhodey), though retconned as one of Stark's oldest friends, was actually a much later addition to the series, not first appearing until the late 1970s. They both work well as supporting characters in the movie. The robot Jarvis, for those who aren't comic book fans and thus don't get the little in-joke, is a play on the long running character of the Avengers' butler, Englishman Edwin Jarvis.<br /><br />The linchpin of the film is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark. When I first heard of his casting, it was from a guy bitching about what a BAD idea he thought it was. \\"Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, that's just ridiculous.\\" I said slowly as I thought about it, \\"Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark....that's just F--KING BRILLIANT. Perfect casting.\\" And it was. Downey Jr. can play an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high-IQ addict (I've heard it said we'll get into Tony's alcoholism in the second film) because he is in fact an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high-IQ addict. It's tempting to say that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play this role.
0684824906|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  Having grown up in the south in the 1950's where children knew its horrors from grandparents who heard from their parents, the Civil War I learned about was quite different from the one presented here.  Lincoln was revered but a seemingly mythological way.  Doris Kearns Goodwin lays out facts and events wonderfully, connecting them into a most meaningful picture.  Excellent!
B000WZAE1I|3.0|It took a month for the movie to arrive.  I had actually forgotten I had ordered it and purchased it in town a week before this one arrived.  Great movie.... slow shipping.
0312370849|5.0|I loved this book, Sarah's Key, even though I cried almost all through the whole story and carried the sorrow it evoked within me long afterwards. I saw Sarah a little girl in 1942 and I saw Julia, a journalist in 2002 who learns about the roundup of the French Jews, Sarah among them, and sets out to find out what happened to Sarah. Both came alive to carry their story as if they were real and not fictional characters created by the author.  I have read a lot of Holocaust stories, but had never heard of non-Germans, non-Nazis carrying out the deportation of the Jewish people.  How the French police could act so robotically in this most henious of acts is really upsetting. What would have happened, I wonder, if the entire force had refused to do the Nazi's bidding? It makes one wonder what acts we ourselves might be capable of.   On July 16, 1942,  10,000 French Jews, parents and their children were taken from their homes by the French police to a large enclosure where they endured thirst, hunger,deplorable unsanitary conditions, and most of all a dreaded fear. Afterwards they were separated into three groups, men, women, children, and all but the few who escaped, Sarah among them, were exterminated.  I still feel deep sorrow as I write this review, nearly a week after reading the book, and have to hold back the tears for this little 10-year-old Sarah whose heart was broken and who never in her lifetime, ever really mended that broken heart.  How many others who survived the horror of those years lived the rest of their lives with broken hearts?  The chapters are short, especially the ones concerning Sarah. They needed to be, so we could stand to read them. I must mention that the French, like people all over the world, have among them, individuals who would risk all, perhaps even lay down their lives to help another human being, and they were the ones who saved Sarah's life even if they couldn't keep her heart from breaking.   Eunice Boeve, Author of Maggie Rose andSass
B000VECAC6|4.0|Even funnier than the first time I saw this movie, years ago.  Classic Python humor - never gets old.  Even turned my kids onto it.
B000093FLA|5.0|I recently saw this movie on cable even though it has been out for a couple of years.  I enjoyed it so much that I knew I had to add it to my personal collection because it kept me in stitches.  I am so glad I did!
B000WTBMBK|5.0|i just love this cd... even its a few years old its still one of the best album
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|My daughter had this movie and I watched it about 20 times. I finally bought my own. I love Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightly. I mostly watch it with the subtitles because they talk so fast it's hard to understand everything they say. If you love chick flicks or love stories, this is the movie for you.
B001TK8TJO|5.0|This book is simple and to the point. My fiance and I identified the portions that pertained to our own personalities, tore them out, and gave them to each other. We have been showing love to each other in ways the other perceives it, not the way we like to show it. It's been wonderful!
B0026P3G12|5.0|We purchased this CD soon after it was released and have been playing it non-stop for days. Susan Boyle has an incredible, beautiful voice. The song selection and arrangements are perfect. There is not a bad song in the bunch. Her rendition of Who I Was Born To Be gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.
B000002UQJ|3.0|The album is ok I guess, but I find the tracks just lack that extra something. I think that Paul reaches true magic when he is solo: listen to 'little willow' or any of the other solo outings on 'flaming pie', they have a kind of organic mellowness to them. Here, he is with a band, and it feels strained and a little artificial in the way he sings. There is a lack of heart in these songs.  That being said, there are a few good songs here: 'Golden earth girl' is the one time he records something near beutiful on the album and the oboe/flute (not sure) is excellent. 'The lovers that never were' is nice. But I dislike the tuneless 'get out of my way' and 'biker like an icon' has no melody, similarly 'looking for changes' is overblown and pretentious and irritates me, especially the 'you know what I mean' bits. Overdone and false. I also find 'cmon people' overblown and pompous.  Not great.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is one of those films that should be at, or close to, the top of anyone's list of \\"must-see\\" movies. George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the end of his rope and he buys into Mr. Potter's (Lionel Barrymore) opinion that \\"he is worth more dead than alive\\". As a result of the prayers of his loved ones, George's guardian angel, Clarence (Henry Travers), comes to help. Clarence is somewhat inept as an angel and has only reached the rank of A1C (Angle first class). He has been promised that if he succeeds in helping George through his \\"critical night\\" he will finally earn his wings. Clarence learns that George, who dreams of traveling the world and becoming an architect, is a kind and generous fellow who constantly puts his dreams on hold when life gets in the way. George appears to take things in stride, especially after he marries Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and becomes the father of four children. But one unfortunate Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) misplaces $8,000 belonging to the Bailey Building and Loan. Even more unfortunate: the bank examiner wants to look at the books. A desparate George Bailey falls apart and in dispair decides to end his life. Enter Clarence...who gives George the \\"gift\\" of seeing what the world would be like if he had never been born. I don't want to spoil your viewing pleasure by revealing the details. Suffice it to say that there is a meaningful message in this wonderful film...that every life is of vital importance as it impacts every place and person with which it interacts. In addition to James Stewart, Donna Reed, Henry Travers, Lionel Barrymore and Thomas Mitchell the film also boasts wonderful performances by Beulah Bondi (George's mother), Gloria  Grahame (Violet), and H.B. Warner (Mr. Gower). I personally prefer this black & white version. I like films to remain as they were created.
B001FB55I0|1.0|This is one of those movies where you watch half of it hoping it will get better, but it never does. As the time progresses, your hope of the filmmakers salvaging the project or building up to something really great fades away, and you're left with an ending that was obviously changed at the last minute and doesn't fit with the rest of the movie (not that the original ending could have been much better). I don't know how you can pour so much money and talent into a film like this and have this be the product. It's a stunning failure when you think about it. The special effects are great and there is a lot of action, and you can tell they even TRIED to put some depth into the story, but even these solid ingredients somehow turn bitter when thrown together the way they are in this movie. Perhaps the movie's worst offense is the dialogue. The very first scene sets the bar for the film so low that you wouldn't think it could possibly get any worse, but apparently the director loves a challenge and he found a way. By the end of the movie you won't care if all the characters die, in fact, you might even wish they did.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I watched this with my kids (5 and 2.5yrs old) - and they really enjoyed it.  The beginning of the movie actually nearly made me cry, but the rest of the movie is really fun and enjoyable in every way.  My 5yr old got a little scared of the 'bad guy', but was happy to see that justice prevails in the end.  It really is a great movie for the whole family, and I recommend it for any family.    The digital copy that comes with this set is great! We loaded it onto an iPod and took it with us over the Thanksgiving holiday and the kids enjoyed the show with their grandparents.    I really appreciate having all three formats (blu-ray, DVD, and the digital copy) so I can have it available on any system we have.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|I purchased a couple of these to have on hand, and almost immediately found uses for them. So I bought another to have a spare; found a need for it, so bought another spare, etc. Now I have five of them!       They are simple, well-built, and do the job. They are especially handy when matching unbalanced outputs to balanced inputs, as when connecting consumer equipment to professional gear.      No, they won't clean up dirty audio for you - that isn't what they are for. But for matching and hum elimination, they are a quick and inexpensive fix. I especially like the dual, independent channels; and yet, they are inexpensive enough that I don't mind using just one channel if that is all I need.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|This show didn't do what some spinoffs do, which is to take the exact same show and just add different characters. This show found a cast that melded well together, had some incredible humor, and was just something fun to watch in the evening. I have to admit that before 6 months ago, i could care less about Sci-Fi, but this show is something that broke thru the stigmas and preconceived ideas about what I thought science fiction was and now I really know what it is all about. Taking your imagination, and letting loose in the galaxy, but still keeping the characters you hold dear as close as if they were friends. I can only imagine the fun they had in creating the show because it comes through in the acting and how it is put together.
B000063UR1|5.0|\\"Silent Running\\" is one of those films that sneaks up on you. Bruce Dern, the only real actor in the film (there are others, but they are more stage dressing), is an established \\"character actor,\\" and that character is usually crazy. In \\"Silent Running,\\" everyone seems to think Freeman Lowell (Dern's character) is crazy, which is important to the film, but you gradually come to wonder if, in his own quiet, idiosyncratic way, Freeman may be the only sane human you see. Three robots become important characters and add greatly to the film. Touching, subtle and blunt, the film is visually stunning, and every single thing you see has meaning. Worth watching several times.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|It is amazing to watch Michael Jackson 17 years ago .. what a talented entertainer in every aspect.  He was ahead of his time.. Looking forward to getting the new DVD too....
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I loved the movie. I saw it this summer at the theater and I decided to buy it when it was released. I grade a movie by whether I can sit through it more then once and you can with this movie, just love it and glad I added it to my movie collection.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan's voice is simply beautiful.  I want more... more gospel, more show tunes, just more.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|This movie does have alot of action, but what about the character, James Bond?  In past James Bond movies, he was always cool, handsome, smart, sexy, and tough. I found Daniel Craig lacking in some of the qualifications.  Apparently, they wanted a new look and edge to James Bond, but I feel they should have stuck to the look of the character.  There had to have been other actors to choose from.  James Bond as a blonde, come on. They must have thought about how some of the fans would take to the new look of Bond.  I am still a fan of Bond movies, but maybe someday, the old James Bond look will come back.
B002MBAJ4M|2.0|I love Gov't Mule, I own basically every cd they've had including some live stuff and bootlegged concerts.  This isn't very good.  Truly Dissappointed
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Arguably, this is the funniest of the Vacation movies. The true test of a good comedy is being able to still howl over the film years later, and \\"Christmas Vacation\\" more than does that for me. But this one works in reverse: Instead of the disaster-prone Griswolds travelling abroad to places like Europe or Wally World, they're anchored to the homefront as the calendar ticks off the days to Christmas. Chevy Chase is clearly in his element here reprising his role as well-intended but hopelessly klutzy matriarch Clark, who naturally, goes overboard with creating \\"the perfect Christmas\\". The reliably good Beverly D'Angelo is here too as Clark's supportive wife who gets her buttons pushed by annoying relatives & whining children as well as her doltish husband.   The late John Hughes crams the script full of holiday satire & references, punched up with the trademark \\"Lampoon\\" slapstick & lowbrow humor. Granted, sometimes the humor tanks, but it's a nobler effort than the previous uneven \\"European Vacation\\". This one just defies you not to laugh your head off as the Griswolds' efforts to have \\"the best Christmas\\" turns into one long train wreck, which can tickle the funny bone of any \\"Scrooge\\".   Look for familiar faces Juliette Lewis & Johnny Galecki (the latter currently on the hit sitcom \\"The Big Bang Theory\\") as the Griswold kids; a pre-Seinfeld Julia Louise-Dreyfuss as one-half of snobby yuppie neighbors suffering at the hands of Clark; and Doris Roberts, Diane Ladd & William Hickey as some of the troublesome relatives come to visit. But it's actually Randy Quaid's reprisal of goofy, freeloading hick cousin Eddie that steals every scene he's in.    If you want a serious rendition of a Holiday classic, watch \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"; if you want to laugh hard & often, then definitely watch this one!
0385532458|5.0|I haven't read many of the Grisham novels, but was pleased to come across this fine collection of entertaining stories, which verify the author's talent and versatility.  My only complaint would be that a few of these tales seemed a bit longer than necessary.  Perhaps a tad too much filler?  Nonethess, I highly recommend this collection, which will provide a good deal of reading entertainment for most mainstream readers.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|This is for a Christmas gift.  I was really thrilled that it included the bonus tracks, and the DVD of her videos.  I think it will be a big hit.
B00009MGGP|5.0|The melodramatic and funny adventures of a backstabbing British politician who schemes to higher office with unanticipated effects.  A very creative and entertaining series with superlative acting and convincing portrayals.  I used the closed caption feature to ensure that I fully grasped the British accents and pronunciations.
B000AGTPUU|3.0|The book is a lovely story with exquisite illustrations.I bought the book and the Tom Hanks DVD  for my 3 yr old grandson not knowing the story. It is too old for him but he enjoyed the book anyway because he loves trains. This is his first year having a clue about Santa Claus so he was hooked by the story.  The movie, however was way too scarey for him starting with the very loud  noise of the train when it came into the yard.   I thought it was dark and heavy not the uplifting story I expected. It was not the warm and fuzzy Christmas entertainment I was looking for.
0811869261|3.0|I ordered this book for my almost 5 yr old daughter after reading about it in a parenting magazine.  The book is visually interesting and each 2 page spread has one block of text that gives the overview of Mouk's travel experience in that location.  Then there are a few little text bits within the illustrations that are a foreign word, the name of a local food or a short description (example:\\"it's raining bougainvillea blossoms\\").    Another reviewer thought this book would appeal to artsy, design-conscious adults, and I completely agree. Grown-ups will like it. But I'm not convinced that young kids will find it so engaging (I returned the book after we read through it).  I've learned my lesson before with books and toys that I think are cool, artistic and educational, and my kids haven't been taken with it as I was.  I found the book's illustrations pretty full of details as it was, and couldn't imagine layering the reusable stickers on top - there's no empty space.  I found the text to be trying too hard to cram in cultural references, so it wasn't a narrative, it was more like a list - and for the age 4-8 crowd definitely bordering on pretentiousness.  I was hoping that \\"Mouk\\" was going to be more like an around the world Richard Scarry book and for our family it wasn't.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|If you're a fan too, you know you want this.  Perfect for a Gilmore marathon during the holidays.
B002VECM72|5.0|I played Division 1 college ball and knew some basics about the Michael Oher story, so the trailers on TV were enough to make me want to see this movie. But my sister who works in the film industry in Hollywood (and is not a big football fan) said that the reviews were lukewarm - so I was having some doubts based on her assessment. Well, over Thanksgiving weekend we flipped a coin to see Blind Side or 2012 and we ended up watching one of the most moving and uplifting films I think I have ever seen in my life. Hell, I was in tears at one moment and laughing like a hyena the next.    I rarely get to the movies, as I usually wait for the DVD release - and I miss a lot of good stuff because I don't really keep track of what's going on even after they go to DVD (I'm still buying vintage discs after seeing something on TNT or BRAVO that I missed back in the '80s). So take this advice from the \\"perpetually uninspired\\" - go see this movie and/or buy the DVD when it becomes available. Sandra B. (who I have secretly lusted after for years) gives an absolutely amazing performance. And Quinton Aaron was born for his part. As for Tim McGraw in the role of Sandra's husband, I sheepishly have to admit that - as big a country music fan as I am - I didn't recognize him, and only realized that he was in the movie after hearing about it on the local country station a couple of days after seeing the flick. The boy can actually act!  And his verbal banter with Sandra is nothing short of hysterical.    Go see it if you haven't already done so. As much as I love football movies, the director of Blind Side kept it in perspective and didn't allow the sport to dominate or overshadow the human elements of the story. There were a TON of opportunities for the director to screw-up by diving into Oher's early life, his experiences in college, his mother's drug addiction, etc.  But all of these elements were addressed in just enough detail to keep the movie clean and crisp (pardon my 'theatrical analysis' but you learn a few buzz words when you have a family member \\"in the industry\\"). My sister even walked out of the film remarking that the \\"timing\\" and \\"sequence\\" of the storyline was impeccable (whatever that means...). BOTTOMLINE: If you're like me, you'll be on the waiting list for the Blue Ray in the blink of an eye. This is a movie the whole family can rally around!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I just wrote a  lengthy review of  [[ASIN:B002BSHXJA The Beatles Mono Box Set]], debating the advantages of listening to the Fabs in both mono, and stereo.<br /><br />There is no right or wrong to this argument, but there are certian advantages to each.<br /><br />For the early albums, up to Revolver, it is mono's hands down. The clean rock and R&B and folk works better in mono, because the music works around the guitars. Since the Beatles used a sharp guitar sound, mono brings this fourth in a huge brick of sound, which may be part of the reason the mono albums were given the Fabs stamp of approval. The 1964-1966 albums were mainly relased in stereo in the US because, first, it was a relatively new medium, and second, the added eccho allowed this music to have the blast of AM radio.<br /><br />On Revolver and after, Stereo becomes more of an asset. Those symphonic records benefited from sounds moving between the speakers. Still, in mono, you can hear more clearly the 100s of sounds the Beatles packed into these masterpieces. Ironically, I find the mono to be a good primer for stereo. You hear more clearly what to listen for when you do play the stereo albums.<br /><br />A Beatle fan can go quite insane trying to decide what the perfect audio treatment for the entire catolouge is. It really, though, is not a question of which is better. You are really hearing different albums in stereo as opposed to mono. So you really do need both if you are a major leauge Beatle fan.<br /><br />If you are not, though, and don't want to invest the time or money involved with these massive sets, I would argue, pick up the albums you remember. If you are English and liked the 1963-66 EMI records with their clean sound, there is your answer. The same is true for the other side of the pond--get the American discs if you want the albums you grew up on. If nothing else, you'll be used to the running orders.<br /><br />But for hardcore Beatle fans who want to hear how every nuance of this music works, both box sets are the toolchests.<br /><br />There is even, though, a complication with this. You have EMI vs. Ebbits, and given the option, I would go with the Ebbits for the albums you know. The EMIs are louder and more modern. There are defiantely sounds you can hear better, but they are moved up front. This is antithetical to the rounded sound the Beatles gave the albums in the 60s, where every little sound worked together<br /><br />. Getting the Ebbits, though, will take more legwork.<br /><br />To get the whole deal in two shots, this and the mono box are the way to go.<br /><br />***PS 12/4 It is interesting that I reviewed the stereo and mono boxes on the same day, and have gotten six votes on the stereo and one on the mono. I guess more people are looking to the stereo albums. I wonder what is driving that.***.     There is even, though, a complication with this.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Her voice is a gem!!  I would love to hear her do an entire album of classic Christmas music.  Go Susan GO!!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Well. Take a breath. This past year sure has been great, but overwhelming and confusing for Beatle fans. We have gotten the holy grail redone for us, four times. Ebbits and EMI, Stereo and Mono.<br /><br />For the few crazy, or lucky enough, to be able to lock themselves away for a few months and disect each album, four times, that is either a privalge, or a form of pathology, or both. But for those with jobs and cars and wives and babies and other music sitting that we have not gotten to, it is quite a daunting proposition to go through these albums again, hearing every sound, picking the music apart.<br /><br />With a knee high stack of unplayed free jazz albums and 100cd burns of Kruatrock bands I have not heard yet, I almost feel guilty trying to find the sound on Pepper that only Paul's dog could hear in 1967. But of course I do so attentively because I know when I am playing any Beatle album, I am going back to school. Ivy Leauge. And I just LOVE being in class. Beatle music is one of the top five pleasures on earth.<br /><br /> But where, and how, to start to think about and  absorb this new, massive amount of material is the hard part. So maybe it would help to provide some type of framework to think in.<br /><br />Well, let's start with mono vs. stereo. Certianly on the early albums-lets go up to Revolver-the allure of mono is absolutely undebatable. These were recorded in mono, and the Beatles were there for the mono mixes, not the US stereo ones.<br /><br />The rock, rockabiliy, folk, blues and boogie of the 1964-66 records cannot be beat in mono. This was clean straightforward rock from made with love from the Beatles to you.<br /><br />Mono is just a stark block of sound. And the growling guitars on, say \\"You Can't Do That\\" or \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\\" certianly pack a wallop in mono. Don't forget that the Beatles were staging an insurrection, overthrowing Bobby Vinton and Frankie Avalon. The same advise applies today as in 1964. Play loud.<br /><br />For us Yanks, the Capitol stereo mixes are what we grew up hearing, eccho and all. But still, once you get use to crisp mono on the early albums, it is hard to deny it works better. Besides, it is what the Beatles wanted<br /><br />Revolver is where this gets trickier. This is when the mighty four started to insert those little sounds--the ones we STILL are finding. Stereo speration--the same sound moving back and fourth between channels--became more important, especially on Sgt. Pepper and the White Album. These were the conerstones of early American FM radio, and the big thing about FM in the 1960s was that is was in Stereo. So the case for the later albums being in Stereo is undisbutable, right?<br /><br />Well, not quite: remember, it is not that you hear LESS in mono, you just hear it differently than you do in stereo. Its true that, say on Revolution no 9. you are not going to get those waves of fire bouncing between the channels in mono as you would in stereo.<br /><br />BUT you may actually hear more of the sound, more starkly and more clearly and mono, and there is a lot to be learned listening to those symphonic later albums in one massive block of sound. You can actually pick up on sounds you may not in stereo.<br /><br />This is not to say stereo does not have its advantages. I would say, for Revolver up, listen in mono first, then know what to listen FOR when going to the stereo mixes.<br /><br />EMI vs. Ebbits. I gotta go with Ebbits on this. I have listened to both, and I find the Ebbits are the albums I remember. Yes, you can hear things on the EMI remasters that you don't know from the records or the 1980s reissues. BUT they are not the albums you grew up with, regardless of whether you have the English or American issues. I think what EMI has done is tried to make these able to compete on modern digital stereos, but to me, they are bass heavy, too bold, and unrounded. The Ebbits, on the other hand, are the albums you know, and you can hear these as the Fabs intended, just without the pops and skips and with CD clarity.<br /><br />However, as with hearing mono to find new sounds on stereo, listen to the remasters to hear sounds you can than hear on the more balanced Ebbits mixes.mono to find new sounds on stereo, listen to the remasters to hear sounds you can than hear on the more balanced Ebbits mixes.
B002QB1910|5.0|The first half of \\"Rated R\\" threw me off because I wasn't crazy over most of the songs, but then by \\"Fire Bomb\\" it kept getting better and better.  This is a creative album and I'm quite impressed with Rihanna.  You can tell they spent alot of time on this cd, from the liner notes, cover and musical content.  It has a dark, 80's new wave type of feel, especially the song \\"Photographs\\".  I also like how Rihanna incorporated real instuments on some of the songs.  It's nice to hear real guitar in combination with new generation music.  The stand out tracks for me are FireBomb, Photographs, G4L (best song ever!), Te Amo, Cold Case Luv, and The Last Song.  \\"Rated R\\" takes u on a journey, like a well put 2gether cd should.  Rihanna evolves into a true artist on her latest release.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Couldn't wait for this film to be released.  What a disappointment.  It wasn't the worst of the Star Trek saga, but it sure wasn't the best.  Interesting to see what happened to the Romulans.  They seem to have morphed into a completely different species???  They look and act like \\"pro Wrestlers\\".  Also, too much pummeling Kirk.  It's utterly amazing he lived to be Captain!  This movie is okay, if you just want a futuristic film, but it it NOT in keeping with Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek.  DVD quality is fine.  Still waiting for the future where we boldly go...

B00005JKGZ|5.0|I discovered this movie pretty late in life, I was 37 or 38 and I bought it basically because there is a book on classic movies for kids of all ages and this is the movie the author recommends as the first movie to introduce to your kids. So they showed it on TCM and I recorded it, and I was blown away. My daughters loved it, especially the dance Margaret O'Sullivan has with Judy Garland.  The movie takes you thru a year in the life of an american family at the beginning of the 20th century. Beginning in summer up to spring of the following year. As I'm writing this I can't help but smile as scenes of the movie come to mind: Judy staring longingly thru the window at the boy next door as she sings \\"The Boy Next Door\\"( this is my 6 y/o favorite scene), the halloween scene, the dinner scene waiting for Rose's \\"boyfriend's\\" long distance call (hilarious scene), the aforementioned dance scene with Judy and Margaret ( my daughter's 2nd favorite scene), Judy singing \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" (if you don't tear up, you're made of stone), Margaret destroying the snowmen \\"family\\" ( a little girl's frustration with adults changing their world, again if you don't tear up... well you get the idea).  Give yourself and your children the opportunity to see a real classic movie, that will bring warmth and smiles all around.
B001OQCV24|2.0|Shockingly, \\"2012\\", the new film from Roland Emmerich (\\"Independence Day\\", \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\") is getting some good reviews. I just don't get it. Sure, the special effects are great, but the story is so unbelievable, so filled with cliches and so preposterous it is impossible to take seriously.<br /><br />Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), the writer of a single Science Fiction novel selling about 500 copies, now works as a limo driver as he waits for the next book to materialize. He arrives at his ex-wife Kate's (Amanda Peet) house to pick up their two kids, Noah and Lily (Liam James and Morgan Lilly). Before they leave, Kate makes sure that Jackson knows their daughter must still wear these pull up training pants to bed. \\"She still wets the bed at seven?\\" he asks her. They drive off for a weekend of camping in Yellowstone and stumble across an area fenced off by the army. Jackson doesn't pay any attention to the signs and has his kids climb over the fence...<br /><br />As I sat in the audience, I woke up because I heard a loud noise that I didn't sense was coming from the film. When I opened my eyes, I realized the sound was my snoring. I was able to fall asleep during one of the loudest, most bombastic films I have ever seen because the narrative is so preposterous and the characters are so cliched.<br /><br />Long story short, a scientist (Chiwetel Ejiofor) learns the Earth's core is heating up because of rays from the sun. His data indicates that the Earth as we know it will come to an end in 2012. He takes this information to the White House Chief of Staff (Oliver Platt). Quickly for politicians, the President (Danny Glover) and other members of the G-8 set a plan into motion to save as much of Earth as they can. They begin a top-secret building project in the Himalayas. Strange, secretive men go around selling transport to the world's rich for $1 billion Euros per person. The President's daughter (Thandie Newton) travels the globe to save the \\"best\\" artworks. John Cusack runs into a rogue radio broadcaster (Woody Harrelson), a crazy guy broadcasting from his Winnebago in Yellowstone who claims he knows what is going on. Then, earthquakes begin to hit Los Angeles. Cusack puts two and two together and races to Kate's house to get them to safety. If he had stopped at a Starbucks, he wouldn't make it because the streets begin to buckle, freeways collapse and the skyscrapers of Los Angeles begin to topple. But Cusack and family make it out of Los Angeles to the next stop, Las Vegas. There, Emmerich and his team get to demolish a lot of the signature Las Vegas hotels. Then, they get to blow up and destroy various Washington landmarks. Then, the world.<br /><br />One thing I found odd was that the destruction of the world isn't tied into global waste and global warming, much like \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". The cause of the Earth's core overheating is solar flares. In other words, there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. So there is no message to the film. I guess Hollywood has realized that global warming in a fiction film doesn't lead to seat warming by ticket-buying patrons. \\"The Happening\\" ('the wind is out to get us\\") was a big dud. It seems like I vaguely recall another film with global warming as the protagonist, but I can't quite place my finger on the title because it wasn't bad enough or good enough to remember. So Emmerich uses a device that no one can fix. The only solution is to try to save as many people as possible and as many resources as possible. When they can, they will start to rebuild.<br /><br />As Cusack drives his limo through the buckling streets of Los Angeles, the awkward vehicle does a remarkably good job of evading the destruction occurring all around them. When they make it to the Santa Monica airport, Kate's new husband has to fly the prop plane quickly, putting to use his rudimentary skills as they attempt to evade the eroding runway. As they fly away, Emmerich treats us to a view of Los Angeles sliding into the sea. For some reason, they head to Vegas next. I really think this is a ploy to allow the filmmakers to blow up more recognizable landmarks. When you learn the full story, Vegas doesn't make sense.<br /><br />In fact, Curtis picks his kids up in Los Angeles, in his limo, and is driving the same limo when they are camping in Yellowstone, a couple of states away. When the chaos begins, Kate demands they return and they seem to get back early the next morning. Can you really drive from Yellowstone to Los Angeles in such a short time? Maybe, but it seems unlikely.<br /><br />The special effects are good, make no mistake about that. I was particularly impressed when a fault line destroys a Los Angeles supermarket. The smaller scale makes it seem more interesting and believable. But we wouldn't expect anything else from Emmerich would we? He clearly relishes recreating landmarks with as much attention to detail as possible only so he can destroy them. This happens in all of his films (except for \\"10,000 BC\\" which doesn't have any) and he clearly acts like a kid in a candy shop.<br /><br />But Emmerich is only an okay storyteller. He seems very reliant on the notion of good and bad. John Cusack is a good father, who really cares for his kids and still loves his ex-wife. To get this point across, and hit us over the head with it, Cusack works for a shady Russian Billionaire with two bratty twins and a freshly implanted bimbo girlfriend complete with a yappy little expensive dog. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a scientist who first learns of the problem. He wants and needs to do everything he possibly can to save mankind. To get this point across, his main liaison with the White House is the Chief of Staff (Platt) who doesn't bother to save his aging mother from the destruction. And there are more examples like this. Thankfully, Emmerich doesn't play favorites when killing people off. Both good and bad people die.<br /><br />These extreme examples of good and bad wouldn't be so egregious if there were any thing else. There are no characters with a little of both. Ejiofor is friends with an Indian scientist (who first uncovers the problem in an old Indian mine). He promises to get help for his friend, to help evacuate him and bring him to safety. The Indian scientist (played by Jimi Mistry, a recognizable actor who was in \\"RockNRolla\\" among many other films) and Ejiofor are good guys, so much so they could be considered saintly, so when and if they die, they must die in biblical ways. Two more nods at how unsubtle the filmmaker is, laying on the emotions with a trowel. Cusack's Curtis is a good guy as well, but he is only out to make sure his family is safe. This makes him the most complicated character. And he isn't saying much.<br /><br />Someone at Sony clearly likes Emmerich's work because he also seems to have been given too much money to make this film. This leads to multiple conclusions and multiple \\"suspenseful\\" situations. Really, as soon as you think the remaining people are safe, someone does something to jeopardize them. Then, everyone has to run around, look tense, and shout, \\"Nothing can be done\\" as one-person risks life and limb to fix the problem. These scenes are so overdone; complete with ticking clock and computer generated images showing how close everyone comes to oblivion. Emmerich seems to believe the planet creating havoc isn't enough.<br /><br />Just to make sure we know a new day has dawned, as the survivors look out at a sunrise, Lily Curtis, Jackson's seven year old daughter proclaims she doesn't need to use the training pants any more. Hooray! The world is in pieces, but the little girl isn't wetting the bed anymore. All is right with the world. Good thing she isn't wetting the bed anymore. Where would she get the training pants?<br /><br /> \\"2012\\" is way too loud, way too long, way too broad and not relevant enough to make any of this worth it.they head to Vegas next.

B001PR0YDA|4.0|I actually liked Robert Zemeckis' new film \\"A Christmas Carol\\", which surprised me.<br /><br />A few years ago, Zemeckis began to use and develop his own motion capture technology. Basically, in motion capture, an actor wears a special suit with pinpoints all over it. A special camera films the live actor as they perform and this is transformed into an animated character. This technology allows the filmmakers to create a more human animated character with more fluid movements. The main advance of Zemecki's work seems to be they are able to use this same technique for facial expressions, allowing the characters to be more emotive and responsive to the action going on, The first film using this new technology, \\"The Polar Express\\" starring Tom Hanks in a number of roles, is a strange film. All of the people in the film look like zombies and have soulless eyes. The second film was \\"Beowulf\\" and it was a SLIGHT improvement, but not much. Now, we have a new retelling of Charles Dickens's \\"A Christmas Carol\\" starring Jim Carrey as Scrooge and a number of other characters. A vast improvement.<br /><br />There are a couple of things at work, contributing to make this film more enjoyable. In the past few years, the use of Digital 3-D has exploded and it seems particularly suited to animated films. Now, some studios will only release an animated film in 3-D. Why? The premium charged for the 3-D glasses helps the box office. And I don't mind paying the premium either, because this new 3-D technology is heads and shoulders above what we are used to. I decided to see \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in IMAX 3-D. If I thought regular old Digital 3-D was good, IMAX 3-D is AWESOME. There is a product trailer at the beginning, which makes you feel like you are being transported into the screen. The screen size, enhanced projection and great sound system all work in concert to create an almost immersive experience, exactly what 3-D is trying to accomplish in the first place.<br /><br />When I initially heard about this film and the use of Zemecki's technique, I as skeptical. I just didn't like \\"The Polar Express\\" or \\"Beowulf\\" that much. Why is Zemeckis so enamored of this technology? He can have all of the actors on one completely bare soundstage and transport them to Victorian London. It must save a fortune to not have to physically create all of the sets, props, costumes, etc.<br /><br />But from the first moment of the new film, you feel as though you are being transported to a new time and place. The book opens and we see the first words of the immortal tale and a line drawing before the drawing becomes the film, dropping us next to Scrooge as he inspects the dead body of Jacob Marley, his longtime business partner.<br /><br />With each new scene, Zemeckis and his team recreate a different part or aspect of Victorian London and they leave no small detail untouched. Some of the scenes look like paintings, but in a good way, lush, beautiful and evocative of a different time and place. Others look dark and foreboding, scary and haunted. These compositions really seem to come to life and help to make the story seem real and authentic.<br /><br />There are still some problems with this technology. They seem to have fixed the problem with the eyes, but now the characters have this weird look to the faces. For instance, Colin Firth plays Scrooge's nephew, Fred. Fred looks a lot like Colin Firth, but they have given the character a larger chin, a Jay Leno chin. I guess because Scrooge has the same. But the chin makes his face seem odd. Gary Oldman plays Bob Cratchit and he seems to be a short man, shorter than even Gary Oldman is in real life. To accommodate for this, they have made his head more squashed and round than it is. His face still looks like Gary Oldman, just squashed and round. Each of the characters looks like the actor portraying them, with 'make-up' enhancements, but their faces seem to be stretched onto mannequins, a little like examples of plastic surgery gone bad, like the skin is stretched a little too tight. This and the combination of the odd enhancements make most of the characters seem unpleasantly weird.<br /><br />Because the filmmakers create the exact look and feel of the characters, one actor can play multiple roles.  Jim Carrey plays Scrooge as an old man and at different times throughout his life and all three Ghosts of Christmas. Carrey does an excellent job and brings Scrooge to life, making him seem like the most despising miser ever. The film opens with Scrooge visiting his recently deceased partner Jacob Marley at the funeral home. Convinced his partner is dead, he pauses the undertaker and quickly takes the coins resting on Marley's eyes. Seven years later, when he returns home on Christmas Eve, he walks through his dark house, reluctant to light lamps. He gives his assistant, Bob Cratchit, a dressing down for merely looking at a new lump of coal as he shivers uncontrollably at his desk in the cold office. But then you probably know all of this already because I have no doubt you have seen at least one version of this story already.<br /><br />Carrey has already proven he is an adept comedian, willing and able to do just about anything for a laugh. He has also done some good work in more dramatic roles. In \\"A Christmas Carol\\", he does more dramatic work giving a real depth to Scrooge and all of his personal prejudices against the poor, his family, happiness. At one point, there is an extended chase that feels odd, almost as though it has been included to up the comedy level, to ensure Carrey has access to some slapstick.<br /><br />I find it odd that Carrey is listed as the actor providing the voice for the Ghost of Christmas Present. In the film, this ghost is represented as a semi-opaque black specter, very scary and very much like you would imagine a ghost to be. But this ghost doesn't have a face and I don't think he utters a single word. What exactly did Carrey do to portray this character? Stand and point?<br /><br />The Ghost of Christmas Past looks the most like Carrey, like the filmmakers used his face and simply pasted it on a flame. The Ghost of Christmas Present looks like a cross between Santa Claus and Jim Carrey. What I am describing to you probably sounds very familiar, again because you have no doubt seen another version of this same story.<br /><br />Zemeckis and his team have done a great job of making all of the familiar bits of the book look real and they have adapted the book in a way that seems more faithful. For instance, the Ghost of Christmas Future is a scary specter and would give anyone a fright. It actually might be the scariest representation of the ghost I have ever seen. Marley's Ghost is also pretty terrifying and the darkness, the cavernous of Scrooge's lonely, empty home has been brought to life in a way that most film adaptations couldn't even attempt. Strangely, the spaces don't only look real, they seem to have depth.<br /><br />The depiction of Victorian London, at Christmastime, is really beautiful. Even the dirty, rundown, awful parts they show look like you would imagine Victorian London to be. But the good parts? These moments are what many of us think Christmas should be like. It really puts you in the spirit for Christmas.<br /><br />Which makes me wonder why Disney released the film so freaking early? November 9th? I know they didn't want to compete with Avatar for 3-D screens, but releasing the film three weeks before Thanksgiving when people just aren't in the mood yet? If I were Disney I would have switched the release dates of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"The Princess and the Frog\\". The traditionally animated \\"Princess\\" would have already transformed the box office. Instead, \\"A Christmas Carol\\"'s box office seems a little miserly.a little too tight.

I definitely expected it to be lackluster.. I am not in love with every song..but she has great singles of course, Hard & Russian Roulette -- but the best song is Cold Case Love.. so poetic & Justin Timberlake production makes it amazing. He is pure genius.. Photographs w/ Will.I.Am is next .. Te Amo & Rude Boy are hits.. Go Rihanna.. I hope you are #1. If you love Rihanna, you will love this album.

B000006MS3|5.0|Without a doubt, \\"The Dreaming\\" is one of the weirdest recordings in music. It is the first album by Kate Bush that she fully produced herself, and it heavily uses the Fairlight CMI. The CMI along with some of Paddy Bush's expertise in ancient and exotic instruments give \\"The Dreaming\\" its unique sounds and textures.     Upon its release, \\"The Dreaming\\" was met with mixed feelings from both critics and fans. However, it did peak at #3 on the UK album chart and was the first Kate Bush album to enter the US Billboard Top 200 reaching #157.     The songs on this record are diverse in terms of sound, topic, and even the voices of Kate Bush. The opening track `Sat in Your Lap' is an up-tempo song with pounding drums and piano chords along with blaring horns in the foreground. `Suspended in Gaffa' is a great piano-driven track with a fantasy bounce to it. The title track plays along like a tribal doomsday trance with a constant bullroarer in the background. `Night of the Swallow' is the most majestic and Irish song on the album with soaring vocals, and a personal favorite of mine. Another one of my favorites, `Houdini', is a dramatic and emotional song that is beautifully sung by Kate in a sweet, operatic voice and with a strained growl between verses and instrumental breaks. The last tune, `Get Out of My House', is probably the weirdest song of the album, but a good closer nonetheless.     As a body of work, \\"The Dreaming\\" is a complex and sometimes misunderstood masterpiece, a one-of-a-kind journey that will take you through the strange underworld of Kate Bush.    5 Stars!!
B0000A118M|3.0|Not Coltrane's best.  A meandering search for something more.  There isn't much particularly lovely about the music. Sort of a match with \\"My Favorite Things\\":  While that record toys with pop banality, \\"...Supreme\\" plays on the opposite edge of the groud, with spirituality and mysticism.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Great cinematography! Kiera Knightly did a poor job as Elizabeth, she swaggered about in her tomboyish fashion like she was still on board the Black Pearl. Donald Sutherland was wonderful but the movie over all fell flat. The script touched some points in the book but few of the important points. Matthew Mc Fayden was far from the proud arrogant Darcy and came across as a petulant child. His lines were rushed and devoid of emotion. This could have been a great sucess.
B0016BPWNM|4.0|This is a classic fantasy that holds up well. It has never looked better than it does on the BluRay. Well worth the price.
B001GKYBXA|3.0|'Electric Arguments' is not your father's McCartney, but that may not be all bad. While the album suffers from an overdose of echo and reverb which appropriately reflect the title,  there's a tremendous amount of originality left in Sir Paul and he displays it to good effect. This album reminds me a great deal of 'Revolver' and the latter sound of the Beatles, with a few extra sound effects added. Of course, any pop album that uses Native flute in it can only be good too, but as one who plays it I'm very partial.    On hearing Paul's voice during the 'Good Evening New York' special on PBS, it's apparent to me that time is taking its toll on it, which is only to be expected. His quality of range isn't what it once was but McCartney manages to get us close with some studio help on this album. His bass has lost none of its punch with age and anyone who thinks Paul only plays simple music has obviously not listened to this great album. Even with the overwrought studio gimmicks, I'd recommend 'Electric Arguments' to anyone. It seems that musically speaking, Paul's journey lags far behind his age and this effort gives us good reason to believe that his best may yet be in the future.

B002JIOQCO|5.0|After really getting addicted to Wolfmother's debut album, I hoped they'd be a band I could sink my teeth into time and time again.  Too often, musical artists fall short after a powerful debut album and never regain their momentum.    No such worries here...    Cosmic Egg delivers with a sound that truly rocks from start to finish.  Wolfmother stays true to the style that attracted listeners to its first album, while building on it with a sound that is even richer and more powerful throughout.  \\"Sundial\\" stands out as an early favorite, but there isn't a single song that fails to impress.    The more you listen to this album, the more you'll love it.  You won't be disappointed!
B002NXSRX4|3.0|First let me say my buying experience with Amazon was great as always. Pirce was good and delivery was as expected. Why anyone would buy DVDs or Blurays anywhere else is is a mystery.  The movie...well that was disappointing. There was the expected action and so on but, the movie had a \\"toy\\" quality to it. I think it was more the story line than the production values. Ublike the Marval comic movies G I Joe was after all just a toy with no story to be told.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|[[ASIN:B001GZ6QEC The Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]]] I'm blown away with the quality of The Dark Night. I like to watch the extra features on movies. The director Christopher Nolan shot this on IMAX  film that exceeds the quality of all other movies. The picture is so crisp and clear. My own eyesight isn't that sharp. The make-up is so real looking. Especially on Harvey Dent after an explosion. One of the reasons I bought this film was for the visual affects and stunts. I certainly am amazed.   The Dark Knight is full of action, romance and suspense. Never a dull moment! It's a battle of good versus evil and heroism. Having the courage and character to take the fall for someone else to serve a bigger purpose. The Joker is certainly an evil character, and Heath Ledger did an outstanding job playing him. I wish he was able to see how many people loved the movie.    The Dark Knight exceeded my expectations beyond what I thought was possible.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|What can I say about Micheal.  I did not need to know anything about this CD.  What else is there to say? Except you should own it
B002HML6Y8|4.0|[[ASIN:B002HML6Y8 Van Helsing [Blu-ray]    I have watched Van Helsing many times before, but viewing it on Blu-ray on my HDTV brings it to a whole new level. The little details that I never thought I would notice are clear as day. From the actors wrinkles to the detailed fur on the Wolf Man. The sound is sweet just as well. I just wish I had a home theater system to excel the experience of watching the movie.   I like Van Helsing for several reasons. It captures the interest of many viewers with action, science fiction, comedy and romance. Even though it's a little more than two hours long, I sat on the edge of my seat through the whole film the first time I watched it. Van Helsing is one of my favorite movies, and I would recommend buying it on Blu-ray to get all the extra bonus features.
B000HIVOFU|3.0|I have only heard the samples and opted not to buy. I'm sure the sound quality is audiophile quality, but I can't get past the \\"FLAT SINGERS'. It must be fashionable in this day and age to sing flat or to consistently force notes flat. The GREATEST of entertainers made a fortune doing that (setting a trend?),  and it drives me nuts! I don't want to offend any one's favorites, and if you don't notice or don't care,  then more power to you, but I personally feel that one's voice is his/her instrument and it should be in tune regardless of how much money you make or who doesn't take notice! If I only cared about the content and not quality, I would listen to the Muppets sing Sinatra. I'm sorry, but I don't apologize for my convictions, these are professionals who should know better, and who have at their disposal the marvel of electronic pitch correction. It's like jazz-crooner grunge. Don't you hear it? I won't listen to it!

B002OB9KPE|5.0|SO many good memories of the initial offerings by Transatlantic left me extremely skeptical. My caution was indeed unwarranted as this band, which is so excellent on so many levels, has indeed once again given us something that will last for a very long time. The 77 minute title track worried me at first but after several listens it fit together perfectly! The vocals and bass have taken on a much more enjoyable and prominent role and the guitar and drumming as usual are as interesting as Roine's vocal style. It's rare that you can lose yourself in modern music and this disc is truly the exception. There is flow throughout the entire piece, periods of beauty as well as periods of intense musicianship. Parts 1 through 4 of Whirlwind are exceptional and the rest of the piece does not disappoint at all, as this piece takes us on a journey that in my opinion makes us forget all of our daily distractions. Other reviews have focused on lyrics which they think are too geared towards religion and to that I say who cares what you think of what the lyrics say because the music is flawless. The bonus disc of 4 originals and 4 covers is absolutely fantastic! I love \\"Spinning\\" and its' similarity to vintage Yes and \\"Lenny Johnson\\" is a personal favorite for its beat and wonderful lyrics. \\"Salty Dog\\" is so damn wonderful and emotional due to the interpretation by the band as well as the passing of Mike's dad that I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this.  \\"Hogweed\\" is wonderful and \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" brought me back to some wonderful teenage years.  Thank you Transatlantic! If you tour, I will be there!!!
B00006L3S3|2.0|Recovering from the failure of \\"Some Time in New York City,\\" John Lennon tries to recapture the \\"Imagine\\" spirit with this pleasant, inoffensive album. \\"Mind Games\\" (1973) benefits from its reggae-tinged title song, the underrated ballad \\"Out of the Blue\\" and punchy rockers such as \\"Tight A$\\" and \\"Meat City.\\" Too bad the remaining tracks are undistinguished by Lennon standards. \\"Bring on the Lucie (Freeda People)\\" is a rehash of \\"Power to the People\\" - while \\"Only People\\" sounds like the lightweight commercial jingle it soon became. Though uneven, \\"Mind Games\\" would prove a step in the right direction, as evidenced by John's harder-edged \\"Walls and Bridges\\" (1974).<br /><br />OVERALL RATING: **½
B000IJ79WU|5.0|It's a shame it took over 20 years for this film to see the light of day. This films makes chronologically more sense than Mr. Lester's II. The first time I watched it, I was in awe. The second and third times I've watched, I kept thinking that it was a shame it was not released back in 1980.  I hate to think 'what if..', BUT just this once, 'WHAT IF Mr. Donner's II been released?' I'm sure it would've been a huge success, then we would've had III and IV, all with Donner at the helm, and there might not have been 'Superman Returns' (a great homage to Donner's I an II, but missing the heart).  The beginning and end sequences are a thrill to watch. The 'missing' scene where Clark gets his powers back is not only great, but if you are a father, inspirational. A father sacrifying his own life for his son to live? Great stuff.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I don't know why I am bothering to add to over 1000 reviews, but what the hey.    For me, this is THE album of the decade along with Neurosis's [[ASIN:B00029LNUA The Eye of Every Storm]], ISIS's [[ASIN:B0002Z83KC Panopticon]], Sunn O)))'s [[ASIN:B001UJSVTC Monoliths & Dimensions]] and Red Sparrows [[ASIN:B000H0MMBS Every Red Heart Shines Toward the Red Sun]].    This is less obviously prog and more metal. I am surprised some think this is (1) less heavy that previous - they clearly haven't had the volume up nearly high enough - and Justin's bass sounds better than ever; (2) less sophisticated or expansive than Lateralis - have they not heard Wings for Jambie, Marie, Rosetta Stoned, Intensions and Right in Two? (Vicarious and The Pot are just great Tool rock and roll).    If it wasn't for Parabola (which I think is below average for Tool - too obvious), Ticks and Leechs (great moments but again too obvious after Aenima), the nonsense at the end and Justin's weedy sounding bass guitar, Lateralis would be my fav album of the year. While Danny's drums don't sound as good on 10,000 days as on Lateralis (this is no comment on his imagination or technique, which remains wonderful), on balance 10,000 days takes the lead for me.    Buy and enjoy
B001AVCFK6|5.0|When I ordered my player I ordered this disc as well.  I loved the movie at the theatre and knew I would want it for my collection.  I do not buy movies very often.  I started on the original Star Trek show when it was first on TV, progressed to The Next Generation and all the movies generated by the television series.  This movie often brings a tear to my eye with the nostalgic nuances and it is just plain fun.  The HD experience was awesome!  This is one I will watch again soon!
B0015ABRE2|4.0|*** 1/2<br /><br />After two very strong seasons, \\"Dexter\\", the show about your friendly neighborhood serial killer, takes a slight quality dip. Not that it ever becomes poor or even mediocre, really. It's just that, so far with \\"Dexter\\", the show's seasons seem to be as good as the main villian, who usually serves as a twisted counterpart for Dexter. In Season 1, the Ice Truck Killer, who turned out to be Dexter's own brother, served this role. He offered Dexter a chance to find brotherhood, familiy, and acceptance, but in the end Dexter chose his \\"fake\\" life over a completely chaotic, amoral \\"real\\" life with his brother. In the second season, Lyla, a beautiful sociopath, also offered Dexter the chance for real acceptance by a disturbed kindred spirit, and yet he made the same choice in the end - to save the innocents in his life.<br /><br />The third season finds Dexter looking for a truthful connection with not a brother or a lover, but a friend. Miguel Prado, played by Jimmy Smitts, is a powerful, respected DA. Like with Lyla, the two have an instant attraction, probably because they can each see the other for who they really are - a damaged and disturbed vigilante. Unfortunately, the storyline is slow to really catch on, and for a while, the season seems to drag. It's only at the end of the season, when Miguel and Dexter engage in a killer's game of chess, that the storyline gains momentum. It doesn't help that the subplots aren't particularly interesting either: Deborah's relationship with a musician, Dexter's impending wedding and fatherhood, or Batista's affair with a vice cop are all storylines that don't offer a lot of interest.<br /><br />Fans should take heart, though ... Season 4, so far only two episodes from its finale, is right back on track. John Lithgow's Trinity Killer may be the show's best villian/counterpart so far.
B000002KHH|4.0|I've never really been a fan of this band, I thought the act was \\"cartoonish\\" and simple minded.  But now at 50+ years old I'm learning to play guitar and this music is really fun and easy to play.  These songs are easy for a beginner to play and people know them.  Buy the CD listen 50 times over then buy the sheet music and have fun with this mindlessly stupid and loud music.

B001BJ690Y|5.0|I bought this Blu-ray version of Kill Bill after I discovered my standard definition version was defective. I'm not a big movie collector, I probably own only about a dozen movies on disc. I'm very happy with this purchase. If you like watching movies to be entertained with almost non-stop action, it does'nt get any better than this. The Blu-ray makes the picture crisp and clean, and the soundtrack is top-notch! This is an ideal disc for showing off your home theater set-up!

0307702103|5.0|John Grisham is one of our 21st century contemporary authors from the American South. The Ford County stories are current typical depiction of Southern 'folk life' in Mississippi and Southwestern Tennessee (where his setting usually takes place) states where I used to live for 4 years. I agreed almost everything what Grisham talks about in 'Ford County'. It's somehow politically satirical and entertaining. You'll know the South more once you read Grisham's stories such as Ford County.

B000VBIGD6|1.0|What a dissapointment. This is not true widescreen. The image has been formatted so that it is surrounded with gray bars. When the image is enlarged to fit the entire TV screen, the quality of the image suffers greatly. Plus, there is something wrong with the color and contrast of the image. I'll stick with my VHS version.
B001676320|5.0|Man, this is good.  I caught it on HD Net one time and thought it was amazing.  I wish they offered a regular DVD in the package to listen to in my car.  THis rocks.
B0017VG69U|4.0|A really nice job was done on the film to get all the imperfections out of the film - dust, blank spots, lines, etc.  The new shots of the ships and planets are wonderful.  They didn't go overboard with it and did a remarkably tasteful job.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is the trailers were not remastered.  This still is my favorite show of all time.  I've been watching Star Trek since about 1976, and it never gets old.  It's amazing how the stories have held up this long.
B002VKE0XA|5.0|Went to see this with my wife and we both loved it. It builds slowly and comes to a climactic, albeit un-Hollywood ending. I'm sure the home release will be great, especially if the other two alternate endings are included.     This film does have a lot of haters. Fortunately they're mostly wrong. The movie does build rather slowly, but it fits in with the flow of the story.     It pretty much boils down to the fact that the people who badmouth this film are either the type of people who think that the quality of a film has a direct correlation with the amount of gore in it, or people who simply lack the attention span to sit and watch a movie with an actual story, instead of explosions and boobs (see: Michael Bay).    I received the BluRay today.     I was happy to see that the elusive third version of the ending is included (which was only shown at one showing and features Katie walking up to the camera and, well, just watch it.)    I am very disappointed to say that the second version of the ending shown at most film festivals is absent.     Also, they found it fit to include a Spanish dub of their dialogue, but absolutely nothing in the way of extra features. They even put the trailer for Shutter Island in there, and yet no making of or extra features. The BlueRay transfer does look very good though. Much better than I expected considering how it was filmed.     I still give the movie 5 stars, but the BluRay version is woefully lacking.
B001P06GX4|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2EF2048KYMUZV]]We love playing board games as a family and Blokus has been a big hit.     The very simple game play mechanics make it easy for people of all ages to understand. And don't think just because you're older that you can beat younger players. We've all been trumped by our 6 year old. Playing with 3 players is possible, but it is funnest as a 2 or 4 player game.     The colorful pieces are also very durable - which is good, because we know we'll be playing it for years to come.     See for yourself as our daughter explains why she likes to play Blokus.

B001JNNDBA|3.0|First I would like to say that this review is more targeted at the Blu-Ray transfer of this movie. When I first found out this movie was available on Blu-Ray I had to have it since it's one of my favorite movies. I already owned the DVD, and was happy with the quality of the video on my up-converting DVD player. I figured the Blu-Ray would have to look better since it advertised as HD 1080p. Unfortunately that was not the case; in fact the DVD looks better up-converted than the Blu-Ray does. How does that happen? It appears the studio did very little to prepare this film for Blu-Ray. If anything they made it worse by trying to doctor it up rather than spend the money to re-master it properly. The movie has a lot of dark scenes which are almost all grainy and not very detailed. The light scenes are not as noticeable but you can still see it unless you're sitting a good distance from your TV. I guess the point I'm trying to make would be to hang on to your DVD until they fix the Blu-Ray transfer. At the new price it's worth buying if you don't already have the DVD, but don't \\"up grade\\" to this from your DVD.

B002IR3PSC|4.0|As a life long fan and having seen them numerous times dating back to the early 70's, this concert DVD/CD combo is a pretty good representation of what the concerts looked and sounded like back then.  I think it's more of interesting look at the group at the time and the state of technology and television at the time.  There is only 50 minutes of video, so the DVD part is quite limited by the television show it was appearing on in the UK.  As for the CD part, it is very similar to \\"Bursting Out\\", so musically it is nothing new or different.  For the long time fans who long for those days when the first chords of Aqualung, Cross eyed Mary and Locomotive Breath would bring an entire arena to its feet, this brings back some good memories.  For those newer fans, it is a good sampler of what it was like when they were at their peak. I just wish someone had videotaped the entire concert.

0307588335|5.0|Superb story telling!  Larry McDonald proved the old adage that hard work, perseverance, and true passion to chosen profession can get you where you want to be.  After reading the book, I now see why the BEARS are important in financial markets.  They're part of the system of 'Checks And Balances' to make sure capital resources are allocated adequately to deserving businesses in 'Main' streets all over America.  Unfortunately, the BEARS at Lehman were not able to stop the raging, arrogant, and stampeding BULLS that led the venerable bank to an irreversible insolvency that nearly toppled the world economy. I hope this book becomes a required reading in business schools here in America and all the countries that espouses capitalism and free markets.  I will definitely keep a few copies of this book for my daughters, nephews, and nieces to keep them forewarned about the dangers of history repeating itself!

His thorough grounding in the foundations of art shine through on every page of this new book. There are a few pages devoted to traditional materials and methods, but most of the book contains information any artist, digital or otherwise, will find helpful. Even if you're not painting fantasy images, you'll find useful techniques for composition, altering lighting, color schemes, focus, directing the eye, telling a story, and so forth. Gurney gives quite a few examples of how he creates models, known as maquettes, to paint from. These help with composition and lighting. You may find that, instead of learning a complicated 3D package to create buildings and space ships for your paintings, all you really need is some Sculpey. Need a reference for a mountain? Take a hike and look around for some craggy rocks. Sometimes we get stuck in a \\"digital fishbowl\\" and forget that sometimes the old methods are still the best.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book that's a pleasure to browse. Fans of Dinotopia will find the \\"making of\\" information interesting. Artists of all stripes will find useful information here. Most of the time, your photos need to be adapted or combined with other references. Learn how to make it work with this wonderful book by James Gurney.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|If you value your health, if you care about anyone around you including your family, watch this film. Buy it here or stream it on netflix but get it. ITS SHOCKING how twisted our food industry has become.
0375413405|4.0|This cook book is a very good resource for learning how to cook french food and it goes in to the details on how you can go wrong and even how to correct your mistakes.    Just try the recipes, they're delicious, for example I tried one chocolate cake recently, what a taste.    I was inspired by the movie Julia & Julie. So after seeing this movie within one hour I ordered the book :D.    Only thing it lacks are images. But if you don't mind that the pictures are few and want to learn about cooking with Julia Child just buy it.
0375842209|4.0|A novel about Holocaust in Germany, where the main character is a little girl, and the story is narrated by Death - this sounds like a recipe for kitsch, a disaster. Somehow Markus Zusak's \\"The Book Thief\\" escapes such a fate, probably because of the author's subtlety and ability to write about the deepest and most complicated feelings in simple, although indirect, way. I was very skeptical at the beginning not only because of the subject and the fact that the novel is addressed to children, but also by the unusual, poetic form - I thought it would be another failed experiment - but it was not. The pictures really add to the book and there is no place for routine.<br /><br />It may seem that volumes written about World War II, Hitler and Holocaust have exhausted the subject, so why to continue coming back to it nowadays, when even the youngest participants of these events are very old (certainly, Zusak himself does not experience it directly)? The answer is obvious, of course, and it became a clich&eacute; itself: to remember and to prevent. Especially in children's novels the subject is still valid and has to be approached with caution, when the readers have no other means of learning, what was going on then... Markus Zusak wrote a book for children, which can be read by adults - and the readers, while reading, become transformed back into children.<br /><br />Death meets Liesel for the first time, when the girl is ten years old and travels with her mother to the foster family to Melching close to Munich. Liesel's little brother dies in the train... This first tragedy is followed by many more, accumulating during the war. Nevertheless, Liesel, althout stigmatized by the trauma, is a child who is curious, imaginative, and daring, doing everything young children do at this age: making friends, getting life experience, loving, discovering the world... The book is destined to squeeze the tears from the reader's eyes, talking about real, ordinary people in cruel times, about friendship, sacrifice, beauty and misery in very unpretentious manner. There are no unnecessary explanations, comments or moral lessons (it actually helps that the narrator is Death). The events are just told, as they are - a kind of a contradiction considering that it is also a novel about words, stories and books. Very clever. The only minus may be that the plot does not develop very fast, it is not straightforward, it is bumpy, with many digressions, there are many loose threads, the novel is really like a child's life, and only in the end things come together (well, sort of).ifice, beauty and misery in very unpretentious manner.

1400063515|5.0|Some thought Taleb was redundant but I think he did a great job looking at the impact of Black Swans from different angles with examples. He has a refreshing and non-apologetic approach. When I read the chapter about how the banking system is networked together and his warning about what might happen if one goes down, I thought that was a slam dunk. IT DID HAPPEN.    I enjoyed reading the book. Thank you NNT

B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I'll be honest, I'm not a really zombie/mutant monster film fan. This is one of three that I like. Not really overly gory. Decent characters and a good back story makes this film a good watch. One of the better based on a video game films I've seen.
B000286S8S|5.0|This will be short and sweet since i have the attention span of a 2 year old.  I'm a metal head too (Metallica, Pantera, Megadeth, Sabbath).  Thanks to my parents, I was raised on Van Halen.  There's such a huge difference in sound between Vol. 1 and this since it's remastered.  And they've added some tracks like \\"You Really Got Me Going\\", \\"I'll Wait\\", \\"Finish What Ya Started\\", \\"Black And Blue\\", and \\"Everybody Wants Some\\" among others.  What I don't like is Hagar singing Roth's songs live but i'll be ok with therapy(just kidding).  I'm surprised with all the 1 star ratings. Oh well, you can't please everyone.  Long live the legacy of Van Halen!!!
B0029LHW4U|1.0|Nearly 13 years after the release of their phenomenal self-titled album, Alice in Chains return with a new singer.  This album pales in comparison to the previous one.  Their trademark droning guitars and eerie vocals are still there, but it just seems that there is something missing.  I must say that Layne Staley's vocals just about made this band, you could always tell it was them as soon as he sang the first word, but it's not the addition of a new singer that made this a mediocre effort in my opinion.  The new singer is good, and even sounds a little like Staley.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad album, but it just lacks variety.<br /><br />The songs just seem to go on FOREVER, and seem so very SLOW.  Take the opening track, \\"All Secrets Known.\\"  It's just boring.  The same cord ascension for what seems like 10 minutes.  If you've ever heard their debut album \\"Facelift\\", a few of the songs on it have that same plodding, down-tempo style.  \\"Check My Brain\\" was a single off the album, but it's just not \\"single-worthy\\".  A seemingly endless guitar drone with a radio-friendly chorus.  The ONLY song on here that sounds like them is \\"Last of my Kind\\", a dark, grungy song which could have been on \\"Dirt\\".  Honestly though, their style has never really changed.  I don't really have anything else to say about the remainder of songs, they all kind of meld together in a vague, heavy swamp gas cloud.  It's seriously hard to tell where one starts and the next begins.  They all seem to be about the same tempo.  All in all, an unimpressive effort from a once impressive band.  Buy it used.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|I waited till Dec 1 to buy this and it was AWESOME! This movie had all the elements of the Terminator movies, it had the cyborg tracking John, it had the Terminator chase scenes (again and again), it had the fiery Terminator factory end scene, YES!, it had Arnie as the Terminator and he looked very, very close to how he looked in T1/T2, it had Sarah Connor, the music, the story, the director, it was all pieced together so well and Bale makes it so believable with his angry acting, just awesome. BUY IT!
B001HN69AE|2.0|This movie is weak! But the graphics are not bad! If you're a DBZ fan. I prefer you not watch it! It's a disgrace to the original cartoon shows!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|This if my first set of surround sound headsets and I have to say I enjoy them thoroughly.    -The surround sound works great.  Playing CoD I can hear the people coming up from behind me and determine where the explosions are coming from.  Granted the game is so hectic you can not discern things like that too often, but on large maps when someone is sneaking up behind you it is a blessing.    -The battery life is as expected at around 20 hours.  Thankfully I gambled on rechargeable batteries for them and they have worked out perfectly so far.  (when they are going dead people will tell you on live that they can not really hear you speaking, I also do not hear a loud screech when they die, they just die)      -The wire connecting it to the Xbox 360 controller is nice and not too long to get caught on anything.  A nice heads up also is that when you are not using the mic it is best to unplug this wire since it will cut down on background noise when idling.    -The \\"boost\\" button I have not really used, but when I do, I do not notice a tremendous difference.    -The headset is very comfortable, although I am used to heavier sets where I can have a little more feeling, for some reason in my mind light = cheap.    -The only real drawback after using these for 3 weeks straight that stops it from getting 5 stars is the earphones.  As someone else has pointed out also, after a while on my ear or skin near my ear it will discolor them to a weird black a blue color.  It easily comes off with a little water rubbed on it but it was very disconcerting when I first noticed it.
0061689246|1.0|I really did enjoy this book, but I am disgusted that it is being marketed as a Young Adult novel.  There are two very erotic scenes, and one use of the \\"F\\" word.  I don't even think the \\"F\\" word was being used during Dickens' time.  Shame on you Mr. Gaiman for marketing smut to children.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and for being a chick flick I think most men would really enjoy it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this  because, well, she did blow me away on the You Tube thing.  But I also kind of wanted to support the Cinderella story in a way, and I thought the CD might be okay. I have not bought a CD in years btw, I am a totally iTunes devotee.  I kind of half thought of giving it as a gift to an aunt or something.  But it arrived and I opened it up, and curious, I played it. WOW!    It is really amazing, and a CD I can actually listen to end to end.  Wild Horses brings chills, and when she sings Cry Me A River, she is just flat out awesome.  She sounds like she has been doing this for years and years, with incredible feeling and polish.  I am now truly a fan!  I think I found a theme song somewhere on this amazing little CD.  What an inspiration!

B002QEXN2K|1.0|Except for the title track, the only other \\"good\\" song on this CD is Friends, Lovers or Nothing.  I guess I shouldn't be so surprised because John Mayer is always a little hit or miss, but this one is mostly miss.  If you like his title track, I would just buy that separately.  As for the rest of the songs on here, John Mayer;s style and sound need to evolve enough for you to tell songs apart. good luck everyone.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Before I bought this flash, it seems most reviews were about thermal shutdown. Well, I've now owned my SB-900 for roughly 6 months and here is yet another take on the issue.<br /><br />\\"Thermal Shutdown\\" is an alarm system built into the SB-900 to shut the flash down from further use. It happens when it is too hot and is shut down for a few minutes.<br /><br />I shoot car auctions and car museums. I have spent days and days with this flash and love it. Yes, I have had it shut down on me several times over the last months. The first time it happened, it was a total panic. I thought the naysayers were right and the flash was a dud. Well looking back, all my thermal shutdowns have all happened when I really pushed the flash in a rush. It has since become easy to gauge how hot the flash is getting and how close I am getting to the shutdown point other than looking at the thermostat. (yes, there is a thermostat btw on the flash).<br /><br />The thernal shutdown serves a purpose on this flash and it is easy to live with.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|UP seems poised to win an Oscar or Best Animated film and I can see why.  Who'd have thought a film with a 78 year old hero would be such a hit?  But UP is unique in every way from its poignant opening wonderfully displaying Carl and Ellie's courtship, marriage and her death to the fantastic adventures on Paradise Falls.  And it does so without resorting to the expected cutesiness found in most animated films.  The voice characterizations especially Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer are perfect.  UP is that rare animated movie that appeals to all ages and I highly recommend it.

B001ECE6C6|5.0|If you are a Metheney fan then you've got to add it to your collection. He resonates on a deep level with Jopek in that mystically spiritual way reminiscent of Pat at his best. Her vocals are enchanting and a supreme work of art. The two are magical artists on another level. This work is sensual, deep, and profound. I hope they get together again. Maybe she can be a special part of the next Pat Metheney Group adorned in a feminine ambience?  I love this compilation.
0307454541|5.0|As I write this review, I am sitting at my desk looking like a bat out of hell and feeling like a loafer for lack of sleep.  I got into bed last night at a healthy 10:00pm and decided to read a few pages of Girl With a Dragon Tattoo before shutting off the lights.  At 1:45am I was still awake and had read 175 pages without even realizing it.<br />This book starts out with three equally compelling narratives: 1.An eccentric and highly disturbed PI is given an assignment to investigate a recently maligned financial journalist, 2. Said financial journalist is likewise given an assignment to research the history/mystery surrounding the disappearance of a young female member of a prominent Swedish family 40+ years ago, and 3. Said prominent Swedish family turns out to have an exceedingly dark and twisted past.<br />For about the first 200 pages the story moves along a fantastic clip; each of the many characters really take shape, and histories and back stories are well laid out.  After the 200 page mark, the story becomes an addiction.  More than once I found myself to have knots in my stomach and goose bumps on my arms, I was extremely irritated to have silly interruptions such as WORK, and my sleeping patterns were quite disrupted as I previously discussed above.<br />Unbelievable book; 100% recommended.<br />Rating: 5+ out of 5 stars<br />Suggested With: Unemployment
B002L5GQGY|5.0|About a year ago I got one of his CDs and was underwhelmed - seemed like fairly generic blues and I was a bit disappointed. Boy was I wrong! He can play anything from acoustic classical to metal, and his phrasing and musical ideas are beyond compare. Sound quality and production values - and his band - all excellent. Some negative comments here by others that his stage presence is lacking. I'd disagree and think he puts a lot of juice in his performance. At any rate, it's all about the music and one doesn't to to see someone like Derek Trucks for his stage animation! (Clapton, however, looked a bit bored during his set but did crank it out.) Joe allegedly mastered SRV's song book by the age of 12 and he hasn't stopped moving forward since then. I'd suggest starting with the trailer on disk two, the bus interview where he gives a brief overview of the songs played; the bonus track that follows is a total jaw-dropper.

B002RV01Q8|5.0|\\"The Very Best of Enya\\" is finally issued in its physical formats. The Irish chanteuse, (whose creative work demonstrates sensitivity and imagination) celebrates her landmark career with 22 of her industry-changing classics. Although a collection of hit's, it is the strongest batch of songs and entrancing music videos assembled to date for the artist. \\"The Very Best of Enya\\" has already gone Gold!     All vocals and instrumentation performed by Enya, Arranged by Enya and Nicky Ryan, Engineered and mixed by Nicky Ryan, Lyrics by Roma Ryan, Recorded at Aigle studio. Includes 3 documentaries beginning with \\"Enya: A Life in Music\\", \\"The Making of Caribbean Blue\\", and \\"The Making of Only Time\\" in addition to 13 exquisite music videos.     Excellent design and art direction by Peacock. I love that Enya was photographed as The Poppy of Remembrance - it is perfection.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I ordered and listened to Susan Boyle's debut CD, which turned out much better and touching than I expected from the 30-second Amazon samples.  I also happened to watch the Celine Dion's Las Vegas show on HDTV last night, and came up some thoughts.    First, both have great natural vocals, yet, Boyle's renditions are all unforced, while Dion simply put too much decor on her songs.  I'd like to hear Boyle sing Titanic, that could put Dion to shame (seriously!).      Second, Dion's songs are simply too \\"flavored,\\" just like going out to restaurants all the time - one could only do every so often.  Boyle's songs are simply pleasant one could hear over and over again, whether as a main listening experience or just background music.  Boyle's songs do not \\"demand\\" one to pay attention, if one doesn't have the mind sometimes.    Boyle's debut CD included enough \\"unfamiliar\\" songs, with much different interpretions from their originals that as a listener, I enjoy them all.  Since it's her first CD, she needs to get her \\"feelings\\" out of the way, thus the selection of the songs.    I am pretty sure in her follow-up CD(s), she would do more \\"obscure\\" kind of songs that would sound just freshly new.  If she could do Rolling Stone and Madanna, she could do Lady GaGa (ha!) only if there is one with the lyrics suitable for her and her audience.....^_^
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's first album (and I hope there will be many more) is so much better than I expected. I just cried all the way through the first time I listened to it.  To think that the world almost didn't get to hear her, if she hadn't auditioned for the talent show.  I can't stop listening to her singing.  World class!! right up there with the best singers ever.

0765356147|4.0|With THE HERO OF AGES (THOA), Brandon Sanderson completes his intricate Mistborn trilogy.     On the positive side, first of all, there are many more positive things to say about this book than the longer and slower middle-man, WELL OF ASCENSION (WOA).     --There is more variety in the settings and locales where the plot unfolds.  --Considerably more action mixed in with the balls, political, philosophical and religious musings. All the axes and Allomancy flying around remind me of the god-mode frenzies of old.  --Some of the lesser characters become more developed.  --In general, the characters and the decisions they make aren't as simple as choosing between black or white, yes or no.  --A great many revelations and puzzle pieces fall into place, confirming my belief that Sanderson had this whole series VERY well plotted out from the get-go.    The only negative I have is this: Good novels depend on the reader and the characters having a relationship together. The more human the characters are, the higher the chance the reader is going to be engrossed in them and the story. However, here, as some of the best characters became more god-like, I found that it became harder to relate to them as a human.    And that's it. I'm sure there could have been a few other tweaks and edits Sanderson could have done, but overall this last volume was a great conclusion to the trilogy.    You could say that it has renewed my FAITH that there is still hope for the fantasy genre, that not all authors are trying to walk in the paths of Tolkien.
B0026P3G12|2.0|I was really looking foward to this CD and played it as soon as it arrived.  It is very disappointing--the life, tone, and quality of this beautiful singer are completely missing from the CD. It is as if the producers did not trust Susan Boyle enough to let her show her talent and as others have said the mix of songs is disjointed. Maybe the fact that this one has sold so well will lead to a better second CD.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|The CD more than met my expectations.      I only wish Disc 2 had more of MJ's music, demos, and/or poetry on it.  There was so much he did not publish, this would have been a good time to add more (new, unheard) materiel to Disc 2.      \\"This Is It\\" was tremendous....  His new music on Disc 1 was awesome.

Love him.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is tough and you instantly will start sweating from doing this workout. I really love it, and the things she asks to do are fairly easy to pick up, unlike some of the other exercise DVDs I've tried (I always feel lost doing TurboJam). Just note that you will need weights for the DVD. The only thing that is s lightly weird for me is how sometimes you see the demonstrators doing the exercises in time with the music, and other times it's not in time. Really throws me off since I like to do the reps along with the beat.

B001AQO41E|5.0|My husband and myself watch on an early version of pay per view in 1982 and the version we saw in the hotel in New York had at least two if not three scenes.  The conversation in the kitchen was longer and the Mr. Freeling suggested they speak to the their neighbors.  There as an horrific scene in the kitchen dealing with the dead bird.  I can't recall the other scene but it had some to do with the dead.  Am I imagining things or did my husband and myself just happen to pay for a special copy for the hotel we were staying in for the weekend.  The hotel was the Milford Plaza.<br />Please, someone help me.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|My initial reaction to the segregation trailers of District Nine was a resigned sigh. Here we go, I thought. Another cheezy movie with one gimmick and a bunch of special effects to carry it through the cinemas.<br /><br />I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />D-9 is a film of surprising depth, particularily in character development, something not seen often in modern movies. I don't think I've ever seen a film where I have throughly disliked the main character, only to find that by the conclusion I'm completely engrossed in their fate.<br /><br />In case my first paragraph was misleading, there still are wicked graphics in this film. The film even includes a gravity gun, perhaps a gamer nod to the fact Peter Jackson (producer) ended up working on D-9 instead of the Halo movie.<br /><br />The only criticisms I have of this film is that, although excellent at establishing the setting the documentry style intro is drags out too long. Also the main badguy is a little too one-dimensional and spends the film stating just how much of a dick he is: \\"I love killing prawns.\\" \\"I'm just going to kill you.\\"<br /><br />District nine is the movie of 2009, the only movie in history to make a human mid-way turning to an alien look noble and heroic
B002T921AC|4.0|Want to be Justin Bieber's favorite girl? Then his new album, My World, will be perfect for you.     Released on November 17, 2009, Bieber's pop album contains eight songs, four of which were singles before they appeared on his album.      Included on the CD is \\"One Time\\", the first song on the album. It is about Bieber and a girl who is his \\"one love.\\" \\"Favorite Girl,\\" the second tune, talks about a girl who is better than the rest. The third melody, \\"Down to Earth\\", is about Bieber's relationship with his parents.     In \\"Bigger\\", the fourth number, Bieber sings about how he and his girl have grown up and are \\"big enough to stand next to love.\\" \\"One Less Lonely Girl,\\" My World's fifth track, is Bieber's attraction to only one girl, and how she will not be lonely if they get together. \\"First Dance,\\" the sixth song, featuring Usher, tells the story of Bieber's first dance with his girl, at prom.     In the seventh piece, \\"Love Me,\\" Bieber loves a girl and he wants her to love him, too. His last song, \\"Common Denominator,\\" is about a girl who is the common denominator between Bieber and love.     Overall, My World is out of this world. The sweet lyrics are heart-warming, extremely catchy, and put you in a marvelous mood. The album also has a fine variety of slow and fast songs that make for superb listening.     One thing Bieber could work on in the future is to give his lyrics more variety. Every song, excluding \\"Down to Earth,\\" is about a girl he likes, making the songs sound the same. Also, My World, overall, was not as good as Bieber's singles that came out before the album's release. Last, in \\"Favorite Girl,\\" Bieber says his girl is, \\"[his] prize possession.\\" This can anger girls everywhere, as girls are people, not objects.     What are you waiting for? My World is a great album to buy for $7.99. It helps that Justin Bieber is more than attractive, too.

B00006FDCD|5.0|Love Love Love this movie!!!! Classic Stephen King must have movie- horror filled and won't disappoint!!!
B000001ED1|5.0|This cd is perfect for romantic evenings and laid back parties.  Every time it's played, someone asks \\"Wow, who is this?\\" or \\"God, don't you just love Joan Osborne?\\"    I wore my original copy out, so glad to have another one.
B00000IFP6|5.0|Wow! - David Zinman and the Tonhalle Orchestra created one of the best collection of Bethoven's nine symphonies in circulation. After listening to these CDs, I really cannot go back to listen to the other version I have. The authenticity and genius of Zinman's versions actually brought tears of pleasure to my eyes. To David Zinmad and the Tonhalle Orchestra, thank you a thousand times for these terrific versions of Beethoven's nine symphonies.
0307387178|5.0|Jon Krakauer writes sympathetically but it is still possible to keep from falling under McCandless' spell.<br /><br />I am the same age as Christopher McCandless and while I have lived and traveled to some far-out places (Christmas vacation in Hohhot, anyone?), I never hung myself out on the edge as he did. Then again, perhaps I was not troubled by the same demons. I don't necessarily see the mental illness that Peter Christian does (see personal insights below). I think that's just a face-saving measure to explain away a pattern of poor decisions on McCandless' part.<br /><br />Ultimately this is a compelling book about a young man who wouldn't have been so compelling if not for his desire to be different. What if, like others, he starved to death in the middle of Central Park? Would there be a book and a movie? Would countless others make the pilgrimage to see Fairbanks City Transit System No. 142 if Chris had managed to walk back out of the wild?<br /><br />I think in his heart, Krakauer feels bad for the guy. Even the original article (for Outside magazine) was titled \\"Death of an Innocent.\\" But defending McCandless' reckless actions as the bravado of someone who wanted to be \\"first to explore a blank spot on the map\\" doesn't cut it with me. After all, McCandless lived (and, ultimately, died) in an old bus. It's not like he was building survival shelters.<br /><br />Then again, perhaps that is unfair. Perhaps we should give credit to Chris for at least having faith in himself if nothing else. Hiking out to an abandoned bus in Alaska and living on squirrels and a bag of rice is more than most of us would do. At the very least, \\"Into the Wild\\" provides an opportunity for each of us to question how far (literally and figuratively) we would go to express ourselves and find answers.<br /><br />I was in northern China for much of the period that Christopher was wandering around the American Southwest. Then, when he headed north to Alaksa, I was living in Washington, D.C. and working in Virginia, very close to where Chris grew up in Annandale. We could have easily switched places (upbringing, education, desire to travel). Did he gain insight I can never have? He's dead so we can't ask him.<br /><br />Said Jim Gallien after dropping off McCandless (who was then calling himself \\"Alex\\") at the Stampede Trail: \\"I thought he'd probably get hungry pretty quick and just walk out to the highway, That's what any normal person would do.\\" The problem was that Chris--to his credit and also his misfortune--wasn't normal. He was idealistic and brave, but also selfish and lucky. He had been helped (indeed, even saved) by strangers many times in the past, which probably led to an inflated notion of his own survival skills.<br /><br />I am rating the book 5 stars for the quality of Krakauer's writing (at once investigative and compelling), despite my own inability to embrace the main character, even in spirit.<br /><br />************************************************************************<br /><br />Chris McCandless from an Alaska Park Ranger's Perspective<br />by Peter Christian<br /><br />Both Chris McCandless and I arrived in Alaska in 1992.  We both came to Alaska from<br />the area around Washington, D.C.  We were both about the same age and had a similar<br />idea in mind; to live a free life in the Alaska wild.  Fourteen years later Chris McCandless<br />is dead and I am living the dream I set out to win for myself.  What made the difference<br />in these two outcomes?<br /><br />There was nothing heroic or even mysterious about what Chris McCandless did in April<br />1992.  Like many Alaskans, I read Jon Krakauer's book \\"Into the Wild\\" when it first<br />came out and finished it thinking, \\"why does this guy rate an entire book?\\"  The fact that<br />Krakauer is a great outdoor writer and philosopher is th e bright spot and it makes a great<br />read, but McCandless was not something special.<br /><br />As a park ranger both at Denali National Park, very near where McCandless died, and<br />now at Gates of the Arctic National Park, even more remote and wild than Denali, I am<br />exposed continually to what I will call the \\"McCandless Phenomenon.\\"  People, nearly<br />always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving<br />wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are<br />practically nonexistent.  I know the personality type because I was one of those young<br />men.<br /><br />In fact, Alaska is populated with people who are either running away from something or<br />seeking themselves in America's last frontier.  It is a place very much like the frontier of<br />the Old West where you can come to and reinvent yourself.  In reality, most people who<br />make it as far as Alaska never get past the cities of Fairbanks and Anchorage because<br />access is so difficult and expensive (usually by airplane), travel is so hard, the terrain is<br />challenging, the bears are real, and so on.<br /><br />A very few competent and skillful people make a successful go at living a free life in the<br />wild, build a home in the mountains, raise their children there and eventually come back<br />with good stories and happy endings.  A greater number give it a try, realize it is neither<br />easy nor romantic, just damn hard work, and quickly give up and return to town with<br />their tails between their legs, but alive and the wiser for it.<br /><br />Some like McCandless, show up in Alaska, unprepared, unskilled and unwilling to take<br />the time to learn the skills they need to be successful.  These quickly get in trouble and<br />either die by bears, by drowning, by freezing or they are rescued by park rangers or other<br />rescue personnel-but often, not before risking their lives and/or spending a lot of<br />government money on helicopters and overtime.<br /><br />When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did<br />wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic and inconsiderate.  First off, he spent<br />very little time learning how to actually live in the wild.  He arrived at the Stampede Trail<br />without even a map of the area.  If he had a good map he could have walked out of his<br />predicament using one of several routes that could have been successful.  Consider where<br />he died.  An abandoned bus.  How did it get there?  On a trail.  If the bus could get into<br />the place where it died, why couldn't McCandless get out of the place where he died?<br />The fact that he had to live in an old bus in the first place tells you a lot.  Why didn't he<br />have an adequate shelter from the beginning?  What would he have done if he hadn't<br />found the bus? A bag of rice and a sleeping bag do not constitute adequate gear and<br />provisions for a long stay  in the wilderness.<br /><br />No experienced backcountry person would travel during the month of April.  It is a time<br />of transition from winter's frozen rivers and hard packed snow with good traveling<br />conditions into spring's quagmire of mud and raging waters where even small creeks<br />become impassible.  Hungry bears come out of their dens with just one thing in mind--<br />eating.<br /><br />Furthermore, Chris McCandless poached a moose and then wasted it.  He killed a<br />magnificent animal superbly conditioned to survive the rigors of the Alaskan wild then,<br />inexperienced in how to preserve meat without refrigeration (the Eskimos and Indians do<br />it to this day), he watched 1500 pounds of meat rot away in front of him.  He's lucky the<br />stench didn't bring a grizzly bear to end his suffering earlier.  And in the end, the moose<br />died for nothing.<br /><br />So what made the difference between McCandless and I fourteen years ago?  Why am I<br />alive and he is dead?  Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide while I<br />apprenticed myself to a career and a life that Iwanted more badly than I can possibly<br />describe in so short an essay.  In the end I believe that the difference between us was that<br />I wanted to live and Chris McCandless wanted to die (whether he realized it or not).  The<br />fact that he died in a compelling way doesn't change that outcome.  He might have made<br />it work if he had respected the wilderness he was purported to have loved.  But it is my<br />belief that surviving in the wilderness is not what he had in mind.<br /><br />I did not start this essay to trash poor Chris McCandless.  Not intentionally.  It is sad that<br />the boy had to die.  The tragedy is that McCandless more than likely was suffering from<br />mental illness and didn't have to end his life the way he did. The fact that he chose<br />Alaska's wildlands  to do it in speaks more to the fact that it makes a good story than to<br />the fact that McCandless was heroic or somehow extraordinary.

B002HWBS96|5.0|About the cast:<br /><br />With a cast like this I had high hopes--and I wasn't disappointed.<br />Yes, the singing was excellent--no weak links.  There will never be another Kurt Moll, but Franz Hawlata's acting really added to this Rosenkavalier, which was, by the way, originally intended to bear the title \\"Baron Ochs von Lerchenau.\\"<br /><br />There have been many great Octavians, and often many have been so lovely that it was difficult to achieve that \\"suspension of disbelief\\" and accept them as the young romantic leading man.  Sophie Koch's good looks notwithstanding, it is her practiced acting that lets her pass herself off as a young chevalier.<br /><br />Renee Fleming is at what I'd consider just the right age to play the Marchallin, and her singing and acting skills are likewise at their peak, making her \\"just right\\" for the role.<br /><br />It just keeps getting better, as we see Diana Damrau as young Sophie.  She has the voice, control, and acting skills to present a perfect fifteen-year-old marriageable daughter of the rich Faninal--and she looks just delicious too!  She would turn any young Rosenkavalier's head.<br /><br />Franz Grundheber is Lord Faninal, and plays the role with energy and confidence that add a new dimension to the usual image of Faninal as a social-climbing idiot whose only asset is a large amount of money.  Grundheber's Faninal has strength and authority that let us know that he earned his wealth. He just wants to marry into the societal standing to which he thinks he's entitled.  This may be the best Faninal ever seen.<br /><br />About the opera:<br /><br />I found these to be some of the reasons I'll return to this performance again and again:<br /><br />The \\"presentation of the rose\\" scene.  This is the epitome of a first \\"love at first sight\\" experience.  Sophie Koch and Diana Damrau show perfect timing as they handle the rose and look into each other's eyes.  Is there a heaven more beautiful than this Strauss duet's magic moment of love at first sight!  A nod to the costuming here too, as the young couple, resplendent in silver-white, looks like a couple belonging atop a magnificent wedding cake.<br /><br />Baron Ochs' \\"Mit mir\\" aria is delightfully self--indulgent, and the grand waltz music accompanying it is dripping with sugar--just as it should be.<br /><br />This might be the best ever performance for introducing newcomers to Der Rosenkavalier.  Efforts have been made throughout to insure continuity and clarity of the plot.  Nothing is more illustrative of this than the opening of Act 3, which shows the innkeeper and his staff, setting up for Baron Ochs' romantic rendezvous with Octavian getting dressed as Mariandel to show us that they are all in on the plot to expose Ochs.  A recurrent theme of Der Rosenkavalier is that, at so many levels, things are not always as they appear.<br /><br />One last reason why I love this performance and think you will too, is the bonus feature with various members of the cast explaining their own feelings about Rosenkavalier.  Renee Fleming surprised me with her facile German, easily answering questions in a fluid German that demonstrated that she was thinking in German too.  Grundheber says of the scene with three sopranos on stage together, that there's nothing else like it in music:  three soloists on stage, in private monologues, each describing the situation.  Composer Strauss is commenting on the situation at the same time with the individual voices singing separately and all together, to comment so amazingly on the pain, joy, sorrow, and misfortunes of life.  This is what great opera is all about:  the artistic presentation of Life in a microcosm.of love at first sight!

B00204AA0O|5.0|I've enjoyed Regina Spektor since my oldest daughter introduced her to me several years ago with \\"Fidelity.\\" And though I've loved a number of her songs (\\"Samson\\" is fantastic), her tendency to experiment and dabble with many styles made it difficult for me to latch on to her CD's as complete units. With \\"Far,\\" Regina has released what I believe is her masterpiece to date. There are no filler pieces here, and though she does cover a lot of ground, every song is pure, real Regina. It's simultaneously quirky and serious, melancholy and happy. \\"Far\\" is now one of my all-time favorite CD's, and stands in elite company (Mark Cohn's debut CD comes to mind) as a collection of songs in a single package.

B0009K8L5W|5.0|I think \\"ladrones\\" was probably shakira's last good album before she fell off to being a sellout and joined the mainstream  cult. This album is at a time when she was hungry and gave us a glimpse of her inner soul, what great musicians do. She was a musician at this point in her career- now a mere pop performer. This goes well for Alanis fans, but as a sentimental guy who loves folk and rock I immediately fell in love with this album. But let's face it, great soulful music doesn't necessarily sell. But man does she jam and sing on the guitar. And her voice is majestical- yes! I love all the tracks on this album and still listen to it to this day.  I also suggest laura pausini who goes above and beyond soul music. Her voice is amazing as well and she can hit those notes. Shakira, now that u have millions can u at least make an album for your old true fans? te lo doy la gracia - ahora ponte las pilas.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|Danny Kaye was a comedic genius. He made many movies which highlight his tremendous skill, but none so broad in scope as this. Walter Mitty is a classic \\"milktoast\\" character, henpecked by his mother, his fiance and his future mother-in-law. He is also absent minded, for he is constantly dreaming up new characters for the serial fiction company at which he works. In these delightful daydreams, Mitty creates adventure stories built around his larger-than-life heroic alter-ego.<br /><br />Danny Kaye plays the absent-minded milktoast character so well that you believe that this must be Kaye's true personality. But then, during the day-dreaming sequences, Kaye plays the heroic legends with such bravado, such pinache, that you realize the full scope of Danny Kaye's talent. This is the perfect showcase for a man of his enormous skill.<br /><br />I have always believed that comedic acting is more difficult than dramatic acting. Our modern times have seen the proof of this, with the invention of the come-drama, and with so many comedic actors making the transition to drama and scoring multiple Oscars for their preformances. Comedy requires a range of acting skills from subtle to flamboyant in order to be truly successful at it. Danny Kaye was a brilliant performer, on a par with any we have produced today, and this was one of his proudest moments.

1594488843|4.0|In [[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind]], Daniel Pink argued that America's need for left-brain (logical, linear) skills has largely been replaced by automation (software) -- just as physical skills were replaced by machinery in the industrial revolution -- and he described what right-brain (creative, empathic) thinking adds that makes it critical to today's business success. Now in DRIVE, Pink tackles how to motivate these creative workers (hint: think intrinsic empowerment, not extrinsic rewards and punishments).    His first 130+ pages rate 5 stars; they're filled with highlighter-worthy content that's developed logically and presented simply. They're followed by a 70-page \\"toolkit\\" for applying the principles which, while helpful and interesting, is laid out with huge fonts and lots of white space and feels frankly padded and dumbed-down.    DRIVE is recommended reading for anyone involved in motivating people in the workplace, school, or home ... though I wonder if Pink's message might have reached even more readers if it had been published as the short, succinct book it really is.

B002RSDW80|5.0|What a lovely movie! Amy Adams is playing Julie -- a part that Meg Ryan used to play when she was young and adorable. Amy so is! Chris Messina as Eric, her husband, is a saint (you'll understand why I say that when you see the movie). Stanley Tucci is wonderful and you'll just love him. But nobody can top La Streep! Every time she appears on screen, the film just glows. She is amazing and you will smile every time you see Julia on screen. The only thing that might upstage Meryl is the food being cooked. I had eaten dinner before I went but was actually salivating several times during the movie. Julia Child made French food accessible and you will want to eat -- a lot afterward. Everyone was laughing a lot -- sometimes on top of lines being said, which made us miss the next few lines. This is NOT a chick flick -- I highly recommend this for people 14 and older (younger kids will probably be bored ---- silly younger kids!). I am just amazed at Meryl Streep! She's a true talent. Oh, I was happy to see Jane Lynch appear briefly. Love her! Go, go, go!
B002FRNCG0|5.0|Haters beware--they're back, and with a deeper, moody-rock smash.      Paramore's new album Brand New Eyes dropped September 29th. The alternative-rock CD features   eleven extraordinary tracks, along with an exclusive music video for their single, \\"Ignorance\\".      \\"Ignorance\\" has been branded as an anger song, with passionate, screaming-singing, and a catchy beat. Also featured on the album, \\"All I Wanted\\" displays a classic heartbroken love song, with slow verses and an electric chorus. In \\"Misguided Ghosts\\" and \\"The Only Exception\\", the group isn't afraid to break out the acoustics and belt an emotional tune. \\"Looking Up\\" reveals a positive, upbeat outlook, while \\"Turn It Off\\" is contrastingly pessimistic and depressing. \\"Feeling Sorry\\" demonstrates a rock version of a post-breakup song, similarly heard in \\"Playing God\\". Their other popular hits (after \\"Ignorance\\") may just be \\"Brick by Boring Brick\\"--telling a story about a girl stuck in a fairytale world, and \\"Careful\\", and intense track with an attention-grabbing guitar riff and clever lyrics.     All of these songs contain those captivating tunes and quirky lyrics that keep listeners' heads banging. They also show off the band's extreme instrumental talent, although some would argue that instrumental talent is the only form of talent visible. Hayley Williams doesn't have the vocal talent of Alicia Keyes, but her screaming/melodious voice fits perfectly with the group's blaring electric guitar and pounding drum beats, which do tend to overpower the songs at times.     On the other hand, Brand New Eyes stays true to Paramore's original sound, rather than getting changed by today's techno-pop upsurge. Brand New Eyes may have failed to top the charts, but that's just how the music wave rolls.      This alternative-rock band is and always will be a personal favorite. Maybe a few songs--\\"Where the Lines Overlap\\", for example--are pretty generic and not as unique as one would have liked. Their rock tunes stood outfrom the start, especially now, during the era of pop. Much to Miley Cyrus lovers' dismay, the alt-rock days will be revived, so Paramore can rightfully shine in the \\"Brand New Eyes\\" of people who used to adore nonsensical pop ballads.     To those glaring from behind Lady Gaga CDs, keep on criticizing, because I won't hear you. I'll have my iPod blaring rock music at maximum volume.      --S.D.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|HBO's attempt to be the liberal, secular media outlet they are certainly made sure this movie didn't have near the flavor of the book itself.  Nonetheless, the movie was good, but it made me wonder how far from real life the movie was.    The book by McCullough referenced continuously how deep the Christian faith of the Adams were, as were nearly all of the Founding Fathers.  Christianity was the basis of the formation of America's independence.  For those who doubt that, just read the Constitution as well as the Declaration of Independence.    The other disappointment was that Amazon's clip of McCullough has David saying how the movie characters actually talk the way they did in Adams' time.  The quotes in his book show that the Adams wrote with far more elegance and flair than the characters in the movie used.  There was no resemblance whatsoever.    Those two items made me wonder how accurate the movie truly was.
B001TOD92C|5.0|After reading through review after review of people talking about Mickey Rourke, I'm actually going to review the MOVIE these reviews are supposed to be about.<br /><br />The Wrestler is probably one of the best long time awaited movies by wrestling fans that remember the guys from the glory days and what became of them to date. Just watching this movie reminded me so much of a documentry I watched long ago about Jake The Snake and his real life struggles with his daughter and his demons. The Wrestler brings a true sense of realism to the silver screen and that's not something that happens too often. This movie is great for one thing, and that's \\"realism\\". An old wrestler who's glory days are behind him and has to work part time at a grocery store while still continuing matches on the side to get by,a worn down stripper who can't seem to settle down and have a real emotional relationship with a man,and a daughter who has been abandoned by her father for a majority of her life, and can't seem to find peace within herself.<br /><br /> I mean these are real people, this is real life on film. At the beginning of the movie you see Randy The Ram as a Wrestler that can still keep himself on his feet, but as the movie goes on you really get to see just how thin thread that's holding him up truly is.  To Randy The Ram, being a wrestler is his identity, it's what he has always known, and what has always motivated him to keep on moving. Even at the end of his career at the very bottom of it all, he still can't let go of it. Only towards the end of the movie do you get to realize why Randy does what he does. He Wrestles because the ring is that one place, where he truly feels at peace.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Breaking Benjamin is one of the FEW mainstream bands that I actually like. They're actually capable musicians who have solid song writing abilities. And they have their own unique sound. You know when you're listening to a Breaking Benjamin song even before Burnley starts in. Not many mainstream bands are able to achieve this, and thus I have had an affinity for these guys over the years.<br /><br />The new album is good. In my world (which is very lonesome sometimes), \\"Without You\\" is the best track on here. \\"I Will Not Bow\\" is getting killed on the radio, gee what a surprise right? Nonetheless, it is also a decent song; as are all of the songs on this release. I would REALLY love for two things to happen with this band during the upcoming decade...<br /><br />1) I would like to hear BB take a more progressive, less mainstream approach to songwriting (although they are great songwriters all the same). It would just be cool to see them step out of the comfort zone a bit and try something more unexpected. I am more than confident that they could pull this off with flying colors. Ben, if you're reading this (which you probably aren't)... write your epic man. You're brilliant, you know you are... just let it all bleed out from here on in.<br /><br />2) I would like for BB to tour with better bands. I would really enjoy seeing these guys live sometime, but I don't think that I could sit through the other performances patiently. This breaks my heart, really... it does.<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"Dear Agony\\" is a very enjoyable listening experience. I would recommend it to anybody who has taste and appreciates good music when they hear it. I do look forward to seeing what BB does with their potential throughout the next decade. And maybe I'll be able to catch these guys live with some better bands on the ticket. Hope. Hope. Hope.<br /><br />- D Man -
0307716988|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I learned alot from it. The first half of the book, which covers the family's journey to become a Motown group, was the most intriguing for me. It was great hearing it from Michael's perspective and the specific memories he has. The book was dictated by MJ and then basically transcribed, so it does feel like he's talking to you. I thought it was very revealing, especially from the early years.  As Barry Gordy says, you can read between the lines. You can tell he is a bit guarded in trying not to hurt anyone or give anyone too much media attention, but I think he shared a great deal. We know alot about his life now, but when it first came out much of this was new information.    As someone who is interested in his career and his creative process more than every detail of his personal life, it was exactly what I wanted. There were some nuggets of insight too, as only Michael can communicate. The opening paragraphs are an example, where he talks about wanting to tell stories. It was also interesting to learn how much he really wanted to work in the movie industry. He has said this many times during his career, so it's interesting and a bit sad to know that he never really got to direct a feature length movie. For whatever reason, he never made that crossover even though he really wanted to.  Maybe he would have after This is It.    Anyway, I highly recommend the book and the additional essays from Barry Gordy and Shaye Areheart (the ghost writer) are great.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love this series. I bought two complete series for my freinds two years ago from Costco at $51.00 + tax. I couldn't spend more $ to buy another set for myself. When I saw the price on amazon, I bought it without thinking twice. LOVE LOVE LOVE it......

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Lady Gaga has most definitely captivated me like she has many others.  She is most definitely not like any other artist currently making music.  She's a little over the top but hey, I could care less how she dresses or acts, what matters to me is that she has yet to release a single I DON'T love.  This album is one that will definitely be getting played out on my iPod.  My absolute favorite songs right now are Alejandro and Bad Romance.  Bad Romance's video is interesting although I will say that Gaga doesn't look good with her eyes bugging out the way they do in it but it's still a great video.  I love watching Gaga's video's because they are interesting... very creative.  I am a bit irked that this album is edited.  I am way past being old enough to decided whether or not I want to hear cuss words.  But the thing that really irritates me is that I wasn't even given a choice!  The album is not marked as being censored.  Anyway, love the album and every song on it!  If you liked The Fame, I'm sure you'll feel the same about this album!
B00009NHC5|3.0|Last 10 minutes are still pretty fun, but otherwise ... whew!  Way too over orchestrated in almost ridiculous ways, very campy dialogue, sudden, unexplainable character developments and a very weird, very 60's cheesey love song at the finale.  A shame really.
6305428050|4.0|This is a very good movie that I remember from my teenage years. It is a little much for the younger crowd, meaning under 13 and some cases a little older depending on the child. There is some adult themes dealing with sex related material, and some adult language. Still a fun movie.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This was an excellently woven mystery novel.  I couldn't put it down--couldn't wait to figure out how it was all going to fit together.  The author's Swedish origins made for fun sidenotes about how the characters like their coffee and setups on their Apple computers.  The names and places were confusing at first, but didn't take away from the story in the long run.  I've already purchased the second book and I'm currently trying to figure out how to order the third in the series, that has already been released overseas.
B001QERPDO|5.0|Heard The Script play on a variety show, loved the one song played and the CD did not disappoint.  Definitely worth buying- enjoy the listening magic!
B001NLKT60|4.0|If you loved The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you will not be disappointed with The Girl Who Played with Fire.  Stieg once again created an intricate tale of intrigue that will keep you riveted to your seat (I recommend clearing your work schedule and ordering out).  At the end, I felt it may have been a little overly complicated.  However, after thinking about it for a few days (yep, this one will stay with you) I've decided it was all a necessary means to an end.  What a great loss that we only have one book to look forward to.  Rest in Peace, Stieg.
B001NESPHC|4.0|I heard of Melody Gardot on NPR and rushed to buy this CD.    I played it as background music during a dinner party and everyone love it.    Only one issue- the order of song titles displayed when I play it on my computer do not match up with the order of the songs on the CD.

B002UPA4ZY|5.0|I cannot wait to get my very own copy of this masterpiece.  I, too, watched it on PBS and again and again.  I'm still not tired of watching it.  If I were smart enough I would have copied it; however, it appears that a block exists so it is off to the Amazon store on 12-8-09 to buy it.<br /><br />I have said before if David Foster is involved in any way I will buy it.  He is as top notch as any single magician can get.  He took barely unknowns and turned them into super stars.  He too a multi-talented Andrea Bocelli and demonstrated the singers superior talents.  The combination of the two performers is enhanced by the addition of several other super stars who simply add more talent to an already talent laden show.  Put it this way:  if one likes Christmas music, talented performers, and really good sound you will not miss the amount this DVD costs.
0374139563|5.0|I read several books on this topic. Dambisa is right. Foreign is a powerful means of exercising control over a countries natural resources. That's why they keeps tribes fighting against each other. They supply both parties with weapons to keep them fighting.     Less foreign aid means less control of a country's natural resources by European, Asians and America and others. The people in need self receive very little or nothing. The money usually ends up in the pockets of government leaders who allow the natural raw material assets of the country to be stripped.

B002P3J3BW|4.0|After being released in a piecemeal, disorganized manner for decades, all of Vladimir Horowitz's RCA, Columbia, and Sony recordings are now available in one convenient, budget priced boxed set.  (The Deutsche Grammophon recordings are not included, of course, nor are the HMV/EMI.)  This set contains some newly issued performances, which I will comment on below.  For space reasons, I refer you to my other reviews on Amazon for the previously issued material.<br /><br />While this 70CD set is not remastered from scratch, this set does use the best existing versions of each recording.  As for the RCA recordings, wherever possible, the Gold Seal versions from the 1980s and early 1990s are not being used.  For example, the Beethoven Moonlight and Waldstein Sonatas from 1956 utilize the Classics Library master from 2004, which is far superior to the Gold Seal CD that was issued around 1990.  Likewise, the 1943 Tchaikovsky Concerto with Toscanini uses the source material that appeared in the 1992 Toscanini Collection, rather than the lower quality version that was used in the Gold Seal CD issued in 1990.  There are numerous other examples.  For those of you who are wondering, the correct takes for the 1976 Schumann Concerto without Orchestra are used in this issue (a set of outtakes was briefly issued by mistake in 1989).<br /><br />As to the Columbia recordings, Sony is using the same remasterings that were used for the blue boxed set in 1993.  (The sole exception is the 1962 Kinderszenen which was remastered in 2003.)  In the 1969 Kreisleriana, the (wrong) takes that were issued on the 1993 boxed set and every CD since are used again here.  So, hang on to your LPs and the MK42409 CDs if you still have them.<br /><br />As with other Original Jacket issues, the cover art from the original LPs (or, in a few cases, CDs) is used.  The original programming is also strictly being adhered to, which has not always been the case with this series.  The advantage is that Horowitz's programming concepts are respected (and Horowitz was a master at building a contrasted and interesting program).  The disadvantage is that the playing time for most of these CDs is short.  However, at budget price, I'm not complaining.  Some trivia: in the early LP era, RCA issued both 10&#34; and 12&#34; LPs, depending on the playing time of the program.  For this set, only the 12&#34; LPs are used, with one exception: the Brahms Violin Sonata with Milstein, which was originally issued as a 10&#34; record and only appeared on a 12&#34; LP decades after the fact.  Also, none of the 45RPM issues are being used (RCA had issued 45s as a transition between 78RPMs and LPs).<br /><br />One CD includes assorted RCA recordings that were never issued on LP.  This includes both the 1928 and the 1957 expanded version of Horowitz's Carmen Fantasy.  The Chopin Mazurka in A Minor, Op. 17,  No. 4 from 1975 that was issued on the Japanese version only of Horowitz Rediscovered is likewise included.  Also, two CDs have the contents of Horowitz in Concert - 1967-1968 and Discovered Treasures, combined with two short Debussy works that were released in 1993.<br /><br />Now, some information on the two &#34;new&#34; recitals:  both the 1951 and 1967 recitals show Horowitz in excellent form and are valuable additions to his discography - though there is no new repertoire in either recital.  The sound for the 1951 recital is mixed, because two different sources are being used: RCA's tapes of the recital and 33 1/3 RPM discs that were made for Horowitz's review.  Both the taped and disc items sound cleaner than those in the Private Collection recordings.  Mozart's K. 333 Sonata is a radically different (and more musicologically &#34;correct&#34;) interpretation than the pianist's 1987 performances - yet I find the later recordings more pleasurable to listen to.  Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata is thundering and compelling, similar in conception to Horowitz's 1945 studio recording, but with theadded adrenaline he invariably put into his live performances.  The Liszt Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6 illustrates one of Horowitz's unique attributes: he could play &#34;cool&#34; and &#34;hot&#34; at the same time.  The ending to this piece defines the word climactic.<br /><br />The 1967 recital from Brooklyn College is in spectacular sound - indeed it sounds more like the Horowitz I heard live than many of his digital recordings.  Horowitz plays the music (including Beethoven's Sonata, Op. 101, five Scarlatti Sonatas, Chopin and Rachmaninoff) in much the same manner as his existing Columbia recordings.  Two exceptions are Chopin's Barcarolle, which is played tenderly and in contrast to his other rather tempestuous recordings, and Horowitz's own Carmen Variations, which has a different coda.  Both the 1951 and 1967 recordings are unedited, so this is the real Horowitz without any interference: imperfect and utterly compelling.<br /><br />Where this set falls short is documentation.  While the liner notes are reproduced on the back of the mini-LP jackets, you'll need a magnifying glass to read them - and not all the LPs had notes.  The 200 page booklet includes track listings, recording dates (some of which are not accurate), another photo of each LP cover, a perceptive essay on Horowitz by Jon Samuels, and a chronology of Horowitz's life.  The chronology contains errors, and there is a humorous misspelling on one of the LP jackets.  The track listing of Volume 55 does not match the contents of the disc.  (I detect the work of interns.)  It's not realistic these days to expect that Sony/BMG can give Horowitz the red carpet treatment that Arthur Rubinstein was accorded in 1999 (although Horowitz certainly deserves it), but is it too much to ask for adequate and accurate documentation?  The above complaints demote this set from five stars to four.<br /><br />One further note: The Horowitz material issued in 2009, including the 1986 Berlin Concert and Volumes 3 & 4 of the Private Collection series (a 5th volume is planned for 2010) are not included in this set.  2009 is the twentieth anniversary of Horowitz's death.  It's nice to know he hasn't been forgotten.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: This set won the 2010 Gramophone Award for Historic CD Reissue.erformances.

B0026P3G12|4.0|Like probably most of the others providing reviews for Susan Boyle's premier professional CD, [[ASIN:B0026P3G12 I Dreamed A Dream]], I pre-ordered the selection on Amazon.com and added to the stunning event that has made her Amazon's best-selling pre-order phenomenon in its history.  The year 2009 will certainly go down as an absolute whirlwind for her, beginning with being initially mocked upon entering the stage on \\"Britain's Got Talent.\\"  Accused of being a frumpy, dowdy-looking woman from Blackburn, Scotland, with thick eyebrows and having a slight learning disability due to hypoxia at birth, she still lived alone with her cat (after her elderly mother's recent death) in the family's council house (the equivalent to sectional housing in the U.S.) after a meager existence growing up.  But Susan always relied strongly on her faith and was popular in her hometown because of her well-known vocal talent.  Those in the \\"BGT\\" audience and those watching \\"telly\\" at home, and most likely the judges themselves, thought surely she would be bounced within seconds.  That is, until the chanteuse began singing.<br /><br />Millions upon millions have seen the YouTube video clips of that initial performance--most from the U.S.--when Boyle first performed \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from the stage musical classic \\"Les Miserables, and the audience's laughter quickly erupted into cheers.  The look on judge Simon Cowell's face said it all.  His mouth opened wide into a proud smile, and the \\"American Idol\\" curmudgeon was obviously charmed beyond belief.  Boyle continued through the \\"BGT\\" process, including a bravura performance of \\"Memory\\" from the Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice stage hit \\"Cats\\" (another YouTube sensation), into the finals.  In the interim, Boyle went through a style makeover, having her eyebrows tended to, makeup, a new hairdo, etc., and underneath lay an attractive woman.  However, despite everything, obviously America was far more in love with Boyle than the UK, as she came in runnerup to a dance troupe.  Boyle was stunned but polite upon hearing the news of her loss when interviewed by the \\"BGT\\" presenters, and within hours was admitted into a psychiatric hospital for a week's worth of \\"rest.\\"  That whirlwind had finally tossed her into a frenzy.<br /><br />Naturally, a live appearance in this summer's season finale of NBC's \\"America's Got Talent\\" was a foregone conclusion.  America was still in love with Susan Boyle, regardless of Britain's decision.  And now, Amazon buyers are obviously wise and correct, because as I write this, I have just been emailed by Billboard magazine that [[ASIN:B0026P3G12 I Dreamed A Dream]] has debuted at #1 on Billboard's Top 200 Albums chart, with sales of over 700,000 copies, which automatically certifies the album as past gold status (500,000 copies) in its very first week.  Undoubtedly, the album should go platinum (1 million) within a week or two.  That is a phenomenon for a British artist whose music would aim toward the \\"light\\" (at best) adult contemporary genre.  In these days of hip-hop's stranglehold on the charts, there is no doubt that Susan Boyle has charmed the U.S. as much as she charmed Simon Cowell--which might explain why she is signed to his record label, Syco Music, under the Sony Music umbrella.  She also thanks him first in the liner notes.  (Cowell also executive-produces \\"AGT\\" as well as \\"BGT,\\" and \\"AGT\\" judge Piers Morgan co-judges on \\"BGT\\" as well.  Nothing like keeping it in the family.  To think they used to despise each other as rivals years ago!)<br /><br />The CD contains 12 tracks, and as what usually happens after a TV competition's winner or breakout star's debut album, the production value suffers.  Most of the tracks are covers, although several are intentional songs of faith and inspiration, so one cannot fault her for that.  They are the stock of what makes Susan Boyle, Susan Boyle.  One is slightly humorous, though:  \\"Silent Night\\" closes the album; one can't blameCowell for strategically placing a Christmas carol on a non-\\"Christmas\\"-themed CD, fully knowing when the album was due to be released.  That's why he's such a shrewd businessman.<br /><br />The CD opens with her lead single and probably best-sung track, her cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"Wild Horses,\\" which was a Top 30 hit for the Stones in 1971.  She performed the song on the UK's \\"X-Factor\\" earlier this fall to promote the release of the single.  Her tender and earnest delivery reveals an aching heart and a hint at loss.  It's easily one of the album's best tracks.  To my great surprise, the production values on \\"Cry Me a River\\" were better on Boyle's self-financed 1999 version (yet another YouTube hit), which just about drained the Boyles of every quid they had.  Singer/actress Julie London's 1955 version is best known, hitting the Top 10 the following year after its inclusion in the \\"The Girl Can't Help It\\" film soundtrack (London later played Nurse Dixie McCall in the NBC-TV series \\"Emergency!\\" [1972-79]).  Still, Susan sings the track perfectly, giving it the \\"heave-ho\\" to the man she is presumably singing.<br /><br />The title track, from \\"Les Miserables,\\" is given due attention, and again, Boyle sings the show's best-known song with power and determination, as expected.  But an interesting inclusion is a cover of Madonna's 1995 Top 10 hit, \\"You'll See,\\" again sung with earnest anticipation and almost a hint of defiance.  One could argue that the lyrics require such defiance, but Boyle wears her heart on her sleeve in every song she sings, and her emotions are always laid threadbare.  Also, on this track--whether intentional or coincidental--Susan sounds a great deal like Ms. Ciccone on \\"You'll See.\\"  If she's trying to do a Madonna imitation, not bad!  (But it would have gone better if we'd heard Susan, not Madonna.)  If it's Susan, well done in either regard.  It's one of the best tracks on the album.  Getting back to her emotional fragility, \\"Daydream Believer\\" is another such example.  Written by John Stewart, a member of the Kingston Trio as well as a solo artist, \\"Believer\\" was a bright, uptempo #1 hit for The Monkees (with witty British imp Davy Jones handling the lead vocal) in 1967.  It was then covered by Anne Murray in 1979 and became a hit again, reaching the Top 15 on the pop singles chart and doing even better on the country and adult contemporary charts.  Here, Boyle has a chance to change the pace and do an untempo song, but yet again, she keeps the mood grim--with only a piano (and synth strings at the very end)--remarking on her handwritten note beneath the lyrics (as provided for each track), \\"The tears of happiness don't mean a thing.\\"  That is but one line in what is, otherwise, entirely a very happy song.<br /><br />The core of the album are the back-to-back tracks \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\" and \\"Proud,\\" and also Patty Griffin's scorching tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr., \\"Up to the Mountain.\\"  They are all outstanding, beautifully-sung tracks.  The former, co-written by Audra Mae, reportedly a British artist of her own about to release her own CD and also allegedly Judy Garland's grand-niece, could be termed Susan Boyle's autobiographical song.  The lyrics are powerful and speak volumes to Susan's continued search to find herself and her place in this world.  And while Boyle claims \\"Proud\\" is about a boy seeking acceptance from his non-approving father, she admits in her notes that, \\"My dilemma was finding my own identity--a conflict, if you like, with myself...\\"  Again, Susan is trying to find out who Susan is.  With \\"Mountain,\\"  no reference to MLK is given, but the choir gives the song the power and respect Griffin's opus deserves.  In dealing with life's \\"'slings and arrows,'\\" as she puts it, \\"God is our light.\\"  On her cover of Skeeter Davis' #2 pop/country crossover supersmash from 1963, \\"The End of the World,\\" which moved along at a pleasant 12/8 clip, in Boyle's cover, the lyrics \\"Don't they know it's the end of the world? / It ended when you said goodbye\\" sound like Susan could mean them literally--although she writes a \\"ha-ha, just foolin'\\"-type note beneath the lyrics.  As for me, I'm not quite so easily convinced.  The song is slowed way, way down, and once again Boyle brings a rather depressing song down ever further and makes it downright morose.  Furthermore, her voice shows a bit of strain and sounds rather shaky.  Whether that's deliberate (for emotion's sake) or due to recording fatigue is debatable.  But at track #11 out of 12, it could make the listener downright weary.<br /><br />On her inspirational choices, however--\\"How Great Thou Art,\\" \\"Amazing Grace,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Up to the Mountain\\" and \\"Silent Night\\"--her unshakeable faith in God is evident in every note sung, whether it be powerful bombast or a barely audible whisper in song.  Also, the emotional debt due her mother permeates the CD.  It's not only written everywhere, it's inferred in each track.  It's evident that her late mother was probably her biggest fan, and this music is a daughter's gift to her mum in heaven.  With only 12 tracks coming in at 48 minutes, it's a short CD for a debut album.  Most CDs today average between 13-16 tracks, and almost all of the tracks were very recognizable covers.  As I said previously, it was a typical rush-job coming in immediately after a competition, just in time for holiday gifts, and except for the terrific choir and Susan Boyle's oustanding voice, the production values are amateurish, especially for Simon Cowell's stature.<br /><br />But I'm not reviewing the production values.  I'm reviewing Susan Boyle, the vocalist.  And she is TERRIFIC.  She is easily better than I thought she would be.  After listening to her YouTube product, especially her 1999 version of \\"Cry Me a River,\\" I predicted that her voice would have deteriorated substantially after 10 years.  I was very happily surprised to find that, despite the fact that Cowell should have just used her own version instead of re-recording the song with inferior musicians and mastering, her voice is better than ever.<br /><br />Her emotional state has been cause for concern in recent months, and I submit that there may indeed be cause for concern.  But on the other hand, with the news that the U.S. is welcoming her with open arms, perhaps she has found people who will truly love her for who she is and not scorn her as her countryfolk have done.  That said, if the system allowed for half-stars, which I really wish it would, I would give the CD 3.5 stars.  But since I can't, I'm going to give SUSAN the benefit of the doubt, not the production values or the number of the tracks or the short length of the CD.  Therefore, my decision is:<br /><br />CD RATING:  **** (out of 5 stars)  --  BOBBY BOURBEAU - Mauitunes  --  02 Dec 09ten by John Stewart, a member of the Kingston Trio as well as a solo artist, \\"Believer\\" was a bright, uptempo #1 hit for The Monkees (with witty British imp Davy Jones handling the lead vocal) in 1967.

In dealing with life's \\"'slings and arrows,'\\" as she puts it, \\"God is our light.\\"  On her cover of Skeeter Davis' #2 pop/country crossover supersmash from 1963, \\"The End of the World,\\" which moved along at a pleasant 12/8 clip, in Boyle's cover, the lyrics \\"Don't they know it's the end of the world? / It endedwhen you said goodbye\\" sound like Susan could mean them literally--although she writes a \\"ha-ha, just foolin'\\"-type note beneath the lyrics.  As for me, I'm not quite so easily convinced.  The song is slowed way, way down, and once again Boyle brings a rather depressing song down ever further and makes it downright morose.  Furthermore, her voice shows a bit of strain and sounds rather shaky.  Whether that's deliberate (for emotion's sake) or due to recording fatigue is debatable.  But at track #11 out of 12, it could make the listener downright weary.      On her inspirational choices, however--\\"How Great Thou Art,\\" \\"Amazing Grace,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Up to the Mountain\\" and \\"Silent Night\\"--her unshakeable faith in God is evident in every note sung, whether it be powerful bombast or a barely audible whisper in song.  Also, the emotional debt due her mother permeates the CD.  It's not only written everywhere, it's inferred in each track.  It's evident that her late mother was probably her biggest fan, and this music is a daughter's gift to her mum in heaven.  With only 12 tracks coming in at 48 minutes, it's a short CD for a debut album.  Most CDs today average between 13-16 tracks, and almost all of the tracks were very recognizable covers.  As I said previously, it was a typical rush-job coming in immediately after a competition, just in time for holiday gifts, and except for the terrific choir and Susan Boyle's oustanding voice, the production values are amateurish, especially for Simon Cowell's stature.    But I'm not reviewing the production values.  I'm reviewing Susan Boyle, the vocalist.  And she is TERRIFIC.  She is easily better than I thought she would be.  After listening to her YouTube product, especially her 1999 version of \\"Cry Me a River,\\" I predicted that her voice would have deteriorated substantially after 10 years.  I was very happily surprised to find that, despite the fact that Cowell should have just used her own version instead of re-recording the song with inferior musicians and mastering, her voice is better than ever.        Her emotional state has been cause for concern in recent months, and I submit that there may indeed be cause for concern.  But on the other hand, with the news that the U.S. is welcoming her with open arms, perhaps she has found people who will truly love her for who she is and not scorn her as her countryfolk have done.  That said, if the system allowed for half-stars, which I really wish it would, I would give the CD 3.5 stars.  But since I can't, I'm going to give SUSAN the benefit of the doubt, not the production values or the number of the tracks or the short length of the CD.  Therefore, my decision is:      CD RATING:   **** (out of 5 stars)   --   BOBBY BOURBEAU - Mauitunes   --   02 Dec 09
B002MW50KO|1.0|I bought this CD based on a rave review on NPR.  What a disappointment.  Instead of being \\"nostalgic\\" as NPR asserted, it was painful to listen to Dylan try to sing these Christmas songs.  Give it a miss!!

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Amazingly enough the best movie to come out this past year is also available just in time for Christmas. That movie is STAR TREK. I know, some of you aren't fans of the series but the fact of the matter is you don't have to be to enjoy or be amazed at this film.<br /><br />Forget the past, forget the original series or films. This movie takes us back to the beginning, back when James T. Kirk was just being born. Yes, the film opens with an attack on a Federation spaceship that will not survive. But those in the escape pods will thanks to the selfless sacrifice of Kirk's father, listening in as his son is born while piloting the battered ship into the alien craft that's attacking.<br /><br />Fast forward several years to an anti-establishment young man who's stolen his uncle's prized sports car, an antique. Or the planet of Vulcan where a young Spock is being taunted by his fellow students for his half human, half Vulcan heritage. Both show early stages of these characters whose lives will cross as they age.<br /><br />When he hits his late teens, Kirk (Chris Pine) is still a rebellious young man. Caught up in a bar fight with a group of cadets, he is rescued by Capt. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) who encourages him to join as a cadet. At first unsure, Kirk takes him up on the offer. As he boards the shuttlecraft that will take him to a waiting spaceship, he meets a troubled doctor for whose wife has just taken him leaving him nothing but his \\"bones\\". Yes, it's McCoy (Karl Urban).<br /><br />A few years pass and the now legendary outmaneuvering of the test known as the Kobayashi Maru (okay, you do have to recall some things from the movie) takes place. Kirk's integrity is called to question by the cadet who created the test, Spock (Zachary Quinto). But before a ruling can be handed down, an alert is raised and an imminent attack on the Federation is at hand. Finding a way to sneak onboard the Enterprise, Pike's ship, Kirk and his fellow cadets face the same ship that caused his father's death.<br /><br />Only Kirk's quick thinking saves the ship from a complete obliteration. As Capt. Pike shuttles across to the enemy Romulan vessel, a wary crew waits in response. It seems that the leader of the Romulans, Nero (Eric Bana), has a grudge against Spock even though Spock has no clue why. Romulans from the future can do that to a person.<br /><br />Twists and turns in the plot pit Kirk and Spock against one another, gives us the reason why Nero is after Spock, shows us the planet Vulcan under attack and...well let's just say you won't find a snore inducing scene in this film.<br /><br />It also re-introduces characters like Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and, early on, Uhura (Zoe Saldana). And it's great to see these now famous characters come to life once more. But it's not just their re-imagining that makes this special. It's their newness instead.<br /><br />One would think that the special effects of a movie of this scale would be incredible and of course they are. But the best thing is that they don't overshadow all the rest. It's not about the beams, the rays, the photon torpedoes that make this film click. It is the interaction between characters we've come to know and love before they even have the chance to know they are going to be lifelong friends.<br /><br />There were so many things about this movie that made it good. The story, the acting, the sense of nostalgia in something new, the special effects, the development of new characters from old. Every piece of it gels together to make one fantastic film.<br /><br />And at the center of it is the story of heroism that one rarely finds in film these days. Too often we find misguided or bad boy heroes who are just as likely to kill or maim on a whim as the bad guy. Here we have a group of people who are attempting to make a better tomorrow.<br /><br />And that was always the secret of Star Trek. We were presented with a bright and shining future filledwith selfless heroes willing to sacrifice themselves for the betterment of mankind and not just their own selfish goals. We glimpsed a future that wasn't the current popular phase of torn down buildings and roaming packs of scavengers. We were presented with a potential future of harmony, of possibility and of a bold new world, no a bold new universe, where anything is possible. And this film captures that essence from beginning to end.<br /><br />When I finished watching this film something happened that I've never experiences before. I wanted to watch it again right then. And I'd already seen it in the theater. It is that good. Unfortunately I had to work the next day. Don't you just hate it when that happens?<br /><br />If someone doesn't have this film on their Christmas list then it should be. And if they do, by all means get them the souped up version as opposed to the one disc movie only deal being offered. Fans will be in heaven and non-fans will become fans. And when the closing credits roll, you'll be left wondering when the next one will come out.d not just their own selfish goals.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|The movie was great, and based on how it feels compared to the Firefly series it is great!! I had at first had hard feelings about watching a movie about a series that died after one season. But after watching this movie I found myself wanting to watch the series, and I got to say that if they turned the theme into a video game or made or extended the story of the show in some way it would be one of the greatest things I could think of and I would greatly enjoy any of it as long as it's executed well. Like many people I prefer wide screen formats, because all thou it makes the top of the screen smaller and the bottom it tends to give you more content on the left and right sides of the video feed.    ROCK ON FIREFLY!!!!
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Loved it.  My kids watched every minute of every disk.  Can't wait for next set.

0882709194|1.0|By now, Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" is universally accepted as one of the most important books ever written.  The creationist introduction to this edition doesn't alter that fact.  However, the only people who will find Ray Comfort's introduction either interesting or persuasive are those people, already creationists, that are least likely to actually read \\"Origin\\" or consider Darwin's arguments.  (That's the point, after all: Comfort is really hoping people will use his introduction to dismiss the book and read no further.)  And if someone is really only looking for creationist material to support their beliefs, they can get that elsewhere for free without paying for a whole book they already disdain.  That makes this a rather silly and pointless edition of an otherwise great work.
0735812594|3.0|The story was true but the illustrations reminded me of a country other than England - I am from England - and the mode of dress was not the same as it really used to be in Dicken's time, but nonetheless it is a beautiful rendition.  Elizabeth A. Lovic, Monroeville PA
B000QUUD60|5.0|There actually aren't many movies or specials or what have you of Live Elvis performances. You have the 68 comeback, 73 aloha from hawaii and 77 Elvis in Concert and of course the few 56 specials and the sinatra 1960 stint. Thats it. Here we see Elvis in the best shape of his life, and the special edition shows at least 10 straight songs making it concert like. The rest is Elvis speaking and jamming and show his normal side. Appeared to be such a nice man, kind to everyone and unassuming.  Too bad prescription drugs were his downfall. But in this DVD you get pure Elvis and at this price its an absolute steal. How does Amazon do it.

It will probably be the last Bible I will ever purchase as it is full of notes and is in a version that I can trust.<br /><br />What was interesting is that the Bible was shipped on 2 November from Omaha but took nearly 2 weeks to arrive here in New Mexico. Must have been something to do with the mule train mail express.
B0012Q732O|5.0|This is truly one of the great epics films to be made and put onto dvd!
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo possesses all the elements of a fantastic Pixar movie- wackiness, comedy, and an exciting plot. The use of color and form makes Finding Nemo one of these rare movies where I wanted to sit in the front row to be dazzled by the animations.    The story tells about the adventure of little Nemo, a clown fish born with a disabled fin. He gets captured away by scuba divers after the conflict and argument with his overprotective father, Marlin. Marlin then embarks on a journey to search and return home with his son safely.   The actors voice the characters so that their own mannerisms are present in the fish characters, which are familiar to us. The director, Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job for the fish to take on the qualities of human personalities. For example, Albert Brooks plays Marlin, an overprotective worrywart and Ellen Degeneres voices Dory as a cheerful fish who has the memory span of an average two year old. The undersea world is just a shade murky, as it should be; we can't seem to see far or sharply in sea water. There is something dreamlike about the visuals of Finding Nemo that evokes the reverie of scuba-diving.   The movie's great inspiration is to leave the sea by putting Nemo to a big tank in the dentist's office. In it, many other fish are held captives including the Moorish Gill. It may seem that there is no possible way a fish can escape from an aquarium \\"out the window, across a highway, and into the sea,\\" but there is no accounting for the genius minds of these creatures which further displays the human characteristics. Also, the fish have help from a conspirator on the outside- a pelican with the voice of Geoffrey Rush.  It is interesting how the director chose the animals to act in an abnormal behavior by converting to vegetarianism. This supports the overall theme of unity between humans and animals due to the similar behaviors between the two.   The first scenes of Finding Nemo are a little unsettling, as we realize the movie is going to be about fish and not people. But of course, animation has long since learned to relate other species to humankind and to care about fish quickly becomes easy as caring about mice or ducks or Bambi.   Finding Nemo provides a pleasant experience to watch or all audiences from children to grownups. The movie contains many twists and jokes that only adults would understand. Finding Nemo is a truly great movie and will keep you at the edge of your seat guessing what will happen next.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Ok first things first....... This movie was very good and has its moments, but it has so many copied themes from all the Star Wars movies used for the basis of their plots that it's not even funny! (SET YOUR WEAPONS TO STUN!!!!!!!!, Spock's anger issues the way it was portrayed in this movie was too close to all the Star Wars moives themes with the anger and fear subject). And even though I am a Star Trek fan I still say that this movie is Not like all the commercials that claimed this movie to be \\"this Generations Star Wars\\". I was disappointed with the special effects with their blaster pistols during the gun fight when Kirk and Spock were aboard the other ship. I was also disapointed in the slow motion look-alike Matrix wannabe fight sequences that were used in this film. To me it made it kind of cheesy. I mean come on Star Trek is better than that!! The alien creatures in the movie used on the snow planet where Kirk was were very good although it looked a lot like something out Star Wars: one of them looked the Wampa out of Empire Strikes Back and another one looked like a creature that was a cross between something out of Episode II and Episode III.     Alright with all the bad stuff set aside This MOVIE IS DEFINITELY WORTH SEEING.It has a lot of action. Any true Star Trek fan will like it, but don't expect to be completely blown away as I did when I first went to see this movie. I thought that maybe this movie would knock Star Wars off the charts in every aspect according to the commercial adds before seeing the movie. Once again they were wrong. All in all the movie was very good and is always nice to see the next chapter in the Star Trek saga unfold with today's technology and a decent budget (for once) for the films. On that not to all of you Star Trek fans I leave you with this,  Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life-forms and new civilizations;to boldly go where no one has gone before.     \\"Live long and Prosper\\" Star Trek!
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|Most of the classics were here, and I thought pretty well-ordered on the first CD.  The inclusion of This Is It and Human Nature were really the draw for me, as I don't have these on any of the other MJ albums I own.  The 2nd CD is a little strange but it's maybe one for the true die-hard fans.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I'm a 'Trekkie' as opposed to 'Trekker' (the difference is explained in the special features) and was really skeptical of this when it came out. But I ended up seeing it three times in the theater and ordered my Blu Ray copy as soon as it was announced. I'm really delighted with it. In fact I haven't even had the time for all the special features as yet.     I own all the Star Trek movies and the series and if you pay attention you'll see stuff in this that shows the people who made it really were concerned with the details. I think the casting and the script were excellent.    By the way, some of the 1 star reviews show that some people think they know Star Trek when they don't. One person complained because they didn't 'explain' Red Matter in the film: Anyone who watched the series knows this is typical of Star Trek where many things are never 'explained.' Show me the explanation of 'DiLithium Crystals' anywhere!    Whether you are a fan of the series or the other movies you'll enjoy this. You can approach this as your very first experience with Star Trek without fear. You miss some details (I had to point out the the Tribbles to my son and he's almost as much a fan as I) but it doesn't hurt the movie.     My Blu Ray version is beautiful and I've loved all the special features I've had time to watch.
B0024HH32A|3.0|Could not wait for the blu-ray release of this classic film.  Unfortunately the quality of the transfer was only average.  Although the film originally had a somewhat grainy (intentional) look to it, that could not make up for the lack of definition and color saturation. It appears that the studio elected to do a 'down and dirty' quickie transfer rather than spend the money on a full restoration, which is a shame. If you own the original DVD I would save your money and wait (hopefully) for a proper blu-ray re-release sometime in the future.
B001FB55I0|4.0|I just got my copy of the Blu Ray version and it is beautiful. Compared to T3 this is a very good movie, compared to T1 and T2 not so good. The Special Features are good except that many, maybe most, are devoted to showing that McG, the Director, is a genius. He makes the claim that none of the explosions (and there are a ton (but that's in all the Terminator movies) are just for impact that all contribute to the story; not so in my opinion. For example one massive firefight and explosion when the 'Cyborg' or whatever it is escapes is largely pointless. Moon Bloodgood sustains a minor injury, but otherwise, nada.    The so-called 'Director's Cut' is a joke. The only thing in adds is a side view of Moon Bloodgood's breast. McG obviously wants people to think he is the new James Cameron, but he is not. He does do a good job of being much more faithful to the story line than T3 and also sets up more Terminator movies without being too heavy handed. But this is not a classic.    By the way, the 'special features' definitely answer the question of whether it is the 'real' Arnold or a CGI 'Arnold.' But you'll have to see it for yourself, I won't spill the beans.
0882709194|1.0|Altering someone's hard work (especially of a dead author) is repulsive and disrespectful.  Anyone supporting this should be ashamed of themselves.  No matter what your belief or disbelief is, this type of deception is frowned upon and should be illegal.  He could have easily given out a pamphlet with the original book, but they instead chose deception and treachery.  This says so much to me about \\"creationists\\".
0545123267|5.0|During an unusually cold winter, a starving wolfpack snatched a little girl off a tire swing in her own backyard and dragged her off into the woods,...<br /><br />but she didn't die.<br /><br />What's more, instead of being terrified of wolves ever after, she watched for them, waited for them, for one in particular, the one with yellow eyes, who ever after seemed to be watching and waiting for her, too, but only during the cold months.  She didn't think about the timing; she thought they were wolves.  Only wolves.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater has given us an interesting twist on the SECOND most overused paranormal creatures in fiction today:<br /><br />werewolves.<br /><br />It isn't the Moon that rules over them in her telling; it is the thermometer.  In hot weather they are human; in cold weather, wolves, and this only continues for a number of years.  Eventually they remain wolves for life.  Things would have ended this way for the yellow-eyed wolf, too, except for another attack: a schoolmate of the girl's is attacked and killed by wolves.<br /><br />Then his body disappears.<br /><br />A crazed wolf hunt gives the yellow-eyed wolf one last chance to be human, to remain human, if he and the girl can discover the secret in time,...<br /><br />while the days keep getting colder.<br /><br />Maggie kept me guessing, both about the secret and about the ending, though pieces of the secret were clear early on.  She also tossed in a number of twists that shocked yet made perfect sense.<br /><br />(sigh)<br /><br />I need to track down [[ASIN:0738713708 Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception]] and [[ASIN:0738714844 Ballad: A Gathering of Faerie]] now and the sequels [[ASIN:0545123283 Linger]] and [[ASIN:0545259088 Forever]] later.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game has simple rules so an average 5 year old could play, but is addicting to anyone who plays...when it comes out at holidays and get-togethers, we always have adults hovering around waiting for their turn to jump in on the next round.  There aren't too many games in which children and adults can truly enjoy together, and this one definitely fits the bill!
B002VKE0XA|4.0|I couldn't avoid the massive hype before forking over my money to see the film that many called the scariest movie ever made. I sat down in my seat prepared to jump at least a few times before the end credits, but it only gave me one mild jolt at the very end. That's not to say that Paranormal Activity isn't creepy, it really is. It's neat how a few loud noises or a flick of a light switch in the middle of the night (there are a few more elaborate gags than these as the film progresses) creates more tension than any big budget horror film in years. I got goosebumps a couple of times and the less is more approach (whether due the whopping $11,000 budget or not) made it much more unsettling. The Jaws rule of the less you see, the scarier it is, definitely applies here. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project make sense. They are both horror films, shot dirt cheap (though Blair Witch had twice the budget) and have the same documentary like style. Only in this case, I was happy to find none of those frantic camera movements that made so many people want to hurl leaving the theater back in 1999. The two main cast members are unknown, but they were much better than expected. The dude got on my nerves a little at times and the arguing got tiresome in between the night scares, but they were successful in seeming like real people documenting the paranormal, not actors.<br /><br />Paranormal Activity is slow moving, especially the first half, and it doesn't live up to the hype, but I envy those who just recently heard about this little movie. I saw it with a small crowd and I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable with a packed theater (unless it's full of stupid teens laughing at everything). I liked it quite an bit and unlike The Blair Witch Project, I can see this one becoming a minor classic.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it will hold up on DVD and Blu-ray, because it was combination of the huge screen, the loud surround sound and the dark theater that made this thing work.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|What more can be said than the 450+ reviews here, which should tell you how popular/good this movie was.  It pays great homage and respect to the classic Zombie film(s) of Romero, down to the socio-culture symbolism, and puts a fresh twist on things by succeeding as a dark comedy.  It's one of those movies where you wonder why this hasn't been done already? Even if you are only casually familiar with the term Zombie or Zombie lore, this movie film puts Hollywood creations such as \\"Scream\\" to shame.  The British makers of this film know their Zombie lore and manage to tie-in logic, emotional empathy and relatability, that's believeable and endearing, often as a result of the light-hearted comedy and likeable protaganists.    *Spoiler Alert*    It was refreshing to see logical wrap ups with characters (why was Shaun's mom not more upset about her husband of 17 years dying and going Zombie? Well because she was bitten also and hid it from Shaun and everyone else until her end, and had already accepted her and her husband's fate, but wanted to appear normal for the survival of her son - yes! Brilliant!).    And of course the subtle but quite effective behavioral parallels that humans are living zombies in many ways, is perfect and blends right in with the dark humor and tone of the entire film.

B0000A1WNY|5.0|The 5.1 Dvd Audio (which also has a 24 bit stereo mix) can be played 3 ways, DVD Audio 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1, or 24 bit advanced resolution stereo. The sound is the best of any Sinatra recording either live or studio. The performance itself is arguably the best live set of Sinatra available, although I guess you could make a case for The Main Event. The latest 5 disc set, Sinatra New York, which contains 4 cds of live performances is not as good as this because it has concerts which were recorded later in his career when he was not as his best. This is Sinatra when he was still in peak form, and you get Count Basie too. A must have for a Sinatra fan whether you get the CD or the DVD Audio.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I bought this for my cousins and they absolutely loved it. They watched it over and over again. Poor CD. It's almost scratched.

B000LXHK2C|4.0|I've noticed that male critics didn't like this film. Could it be because stud movie star Russell Crowe \\"betrayed\\" them by taking on a Hugh Grant-like role? This isn't a heavy-weight drama, it's true, but its charm and its true love for Provence shines through. The plot is standard: bad boy meets feisty girl and high jinx ensue. It doesn't have the complex hilarity and pathos of a Sideways, but this film's formulaic structure is secondary to the gorgeous cinematography, the music, and the quirky characters. A fun way to enjoy the ambience of beautiful Provence if you can't afford to get there soon.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|My absolute favorite version of Jane Austen's Classic Book.  Within the first 30 minutes I'd fallen in love with the characters and the amount of detail from the book.  Though events are somewhat out of order, or rather you learn the information about the characters a little out of order, this version is close to perfection.  Add in the charming Edmund from Mansfield park, Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley, and who can help wanting to watch this mini series over and over.  Well done!
B0029O08WA|1.0|I bought this cd for my fiancee since she loves the movies and books. After a few listens to the cd in her car, we noticed that we were skipping tracks more and more. I have music from some of the artists on the cd so I thought this be a decent cd. Having bought other soundtracks I have learned that the song selections can be hit or miss for one's musical preferences. I think she as taken out the cd from her player in the car and is listening to something else. This one was a miss for us.
B000002UB2|5.0|WHAT in the WORLD are CD (Compact Disc) reviews doing on a VINYL RECORD listing??? Did Amazon completely screw up in transfering the Abbey Road CD reviews onto this product review? NOTE: track listings on this VINYL RECORD is show a \\"multimedia\\" track. HEY! This is not a washing machine; not a car; not a DVD; not a CD; its a RECORD ALBUM made of VINYL played with a rotating plate that has a NEEDLE that makes contact with the plastic disc to reproduce sound waves - not video files! SHEESH! (I say this for the benefit of amazon.com personel in charge of loading up their website info. They may not be aware of what a \\"record\\" is compared to a CD).<br /><br />Like, if I was to look for reviews having to do with that Abbey Road VINYL, I would have to sift through 1181 reviews on that page - most, if not all, having nothing to do with the VINYL version. Amazon should correct their mistaken transfer of the CD reviews and clear the board to allow appropriate reviews to begin to appear. After all, consumers want to know about THIS product, not THAT product!<br /><br />But what you all are missing is the actual item information. This Amazon vinyl pressing is listed as the \\"1995\\" release. However, the record album sold at Best Buy is the 2006 (!) pressing. The differences are few, but wildly different in value, according to Perry Cox and Frank Daniels' official Beatles Price Guide for American Records from 2007. The differences are: Amazon's version has the Capitol Records and Apple logos on the bottom of the back side of the record jacket. It also has 2 lines of text between the logos. It also has a long catalogue number below the UPC code lines at the top of the back cover.<br /><br />On the on the other hand, the Best Buy version does not have the catalogue number printed below the UPC code, the logos are Capitol Records and EMI with no Apple logo, and there are now 3 lines of text between the 2 logos. Oh, and the Price Guide lists this one at $50....herein lies the true value of these review sites - it all helps us to know more about what we're being offered!<br /><br />Now, if anyone can tell me why the pictures provided by Santiago Chavarro are showing the album labels as \\"backwards\\", I'd love to know. You have to enlarge to see the print, but it's very interesting...and very backwards!- it all helps us to know more about what we're being offered!     Now, if anyone can tell me why the pictures provided by Santiago Chavarro are showing the album labels as \\"backwards\\", I'd love to know. You have to enlarge to see the print, but it's very interesting...and very backwards!
0393307050|2.0|Lost. Utterly lost. If I had studied a naval manual before I began this book, it may have been different, but alas, no.  I so looked forward to billowing sails, salty sea air and wind in my face but the arcane, archaic and mostly unintelligible language left me high and dry. It was like an out-of-body experience looking down on the happenings but feeling nothing. At a certain point in the story one of the ship's mates was injured in a skirmish and ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin had to perform brain surgery. Wow! Gory? Fascinating? Not really. It was glossed over and reduced to a sordid blow-by at a cocktail party which  Captain Aubrey was thrown out of! And that brings me to the biggest disappointment of all: the good captain himself.  My God, what an unattractive man! I was looking for a hero instead I got a florid, selfish, prize-seeking, questionably literate, vulgar man whose \\"hams shake when he walks\\". Eww! Grant it, Aubrey is a math whiz and a master seaman, but one who apparently has a lot of growing up to do.  I'm so interested in the missions and possible adventures in the other novels that I may give it another go and read on. Maybe.    I would never do this, but this time I'd have to say watch the movie. Watch Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany bring out the best attributes of that time and place: Disciplined, compassionate, courageous, handsome, literate and spirited men! The music they play is sublime and highlights the more refined aspects of their characters. While in the book, not so much. As a matter of fact, in a fit of repressed uncontrolled pique, the book's Captain Aubrey actually snaps his beloved violin in half! Start with the movie. You'll forget the cold mutton, hard tack and scurvvy and feel honored to come aboard the Sophie!
B002QEXN2K|4.0|i have become an instant fan of JM since the bluray 2007 concert! i picked this album up just recently and you can tell the instrumental have picked up a new set of upgrades. The melody is still classic Mayer but more subtle. If your a fan you will love the album.
055357342X|3.0|My ratings for this series continue to slide (5 stars for book 1, 4 stars for book 2, and 3 stars here), and I think if this was the first book, I'd be less inclined to continue with the series.  That said, the second half of it is fantastic, and brought me back into the fold to immediately start reading book 4.    There is no denying Martin's brilliance - not many authors can create an entire world, with a complete history, and still find ways to make all the characters realistic and human.  The main characters continue to develop, if possible, further into gray.  They will draw your ire and pity in alternating chapters.    That said, it's simply too much.  Too many backstories.  Too many houses with too many generations of history.  It fantastically impressive that Martin can do it, but that doesn't make it good reading.  He may have devoted years of his life to creating this, but I personally don't want to devote my life to reading it and learning it, just to get the real reason this character is double-crossing that.  It would've been just as impressive, and better reading, pared back by about 50% in this volume.    I also noticed the editing in this one had numerous typographical mistakes (\\"windows and orphans\\" was one example,  another was Arya pulling the same knife out of the woodwork twice in subsequent paragraphs, and the italicized internal monologues are just tiring.).  Perhaps the editors got lulled as well.    However, just as I thought I was done, WHAM!  The plot twists were back!  The double crosses, the deaths of main characters, the battles turning - all the thrillers that keep readers on the edge of their seat were back!  The second half of the book moves most of the plot lines along significantly and rapidly.  It was enough to keep me up reading until the wee hours night after night until I finished.    I know there are some devotees who feel the complexities and histories must be appreciated - and I did for the first two books.  However, averaging 1,000 pages a pop, you start to get into real time investment issues.  I also have the perspective of someone who is reading these books consecutively - I can't imagine waiting years for the next installment and trying to get all ramped up again.

0061537969|2.0|This novel is narrated by a dog. Whatever you dog is thinking, this isn't it. A lab terrier mix is randomly chosen from a litter on a farm outside Seattle by race car driver Denny Swift. Denny Swift. Swift...race car driver. You get it, right?    Denny names the dog Enzo. Denny marries Eve and together they have daughter, Zoë. Enzo watches television, especially the American Movie Channel, ESPN when NASCAR is on and apparently the International Film channel when it is showing French films. Enzo can understand human speech but can't talk. Like a Frenchman, Enzo complains on his deathbed about the collective ennui of the human race. Yes, Enzo thinks the words 'collective ennui.'     Other TV channels, though not mentioned in the narrative, must have been watched by the dog. The Buddhism Channel, the Hindu Channel, The Rosicrucian Channel, and the Reincarnation Channel. This novel is in the same vein as that early 1970's bestseller Jonathan Livingston Seagull in which a bird teaches humans the many answers to the question \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\"     Denny uses the family's savings and home value to make it on the professional racing circuit. Eve gets cancer and dies. The evil twins, the grandparents, create suspicions and file a lawsuit to take Zoe away from Dad. Enzo takes time away from watching Denny's racing videos to create Buddhist koans that apply to both driving and life: \\"The car goes where the eyes go\\". Melodrama advances the plot through which the human characters sit, walk, fetch and file lawsuits.     The end comes suddenly. A Porsche heir enters with an offer of employment. Denny's parents, who have been missing from the novel from page one, drop in overnight and leave a check equal to the value of their farm. A witness recants testimony.     The Art of Racing in the Rain is destined for the Hallmark television channel. It is suitable for young adults and their parents, while they are in a car with the cruise control on.

B0013FFMOK|4.0|While not as good as the original \\"The Omega Man\\", it`s still a pretty good end of the world type movie.<br />Generally remakes never come close to the same standards as the original. And while this one did fall short, it was much better<br />than I had expected. The special effects are better than the original, but given 40+ years difference they ought to be.<br />The main saving grace of this film is Will Smith. He`s an excellent actor and he did a good job on this movie. In his role as Robert<br />Neville, he really made you believe that he had been alone for three years. A little lost, a little robotic, a little crazy. Just<br />about what you would expect of a person who had been through something like that. Very much like Charlton Heston as Neville in the<br />original movie.<br />Is Will Smith in the same class as Charlton Heston? Not quite. But Smith is still fairly young. Give him another 5 or 10 years<br />and I think he will be at least as good. Maybe better.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Inspired song selection, brilliant orchestration, and, of course, Susan Boyle.  She's proven to be just as talented in studio sessions, a quite different challenge, as during her live performances. Bravo!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|The first 10 minutes gets me to reflect the years that have passed by me. I'm not old, but today I think more about practical life than pursuing dreams. However, when I watch this movie, I couldn't help remembering those dreams, plans, and efforts that I once had or paid. Most of those are no longer with me. This movie gets them back. A movie that instills reflections of life into a person's mind is the best movie in my book.
B001GCUNW6|4.0|my wife compelled me to watch the blu-ray edition of this picture as she loved it so . i recognized and enjoyed the voice talent a lot , particularly DENIS LEARY and SIMON PEGG. the images are truly arresting and the story was very fun and cute . with its PG rating i think this might appeal to parents more than a lot of the animated pictures out there (i couldn't be more out of the loop regarding this) . while i'm not one for anthropomorphic stuff , i'd watch it again . several good story lines , clever dialog and action keep things moving along quite well . i dislike the insertion of human baby voices where baby animals are concerned . JOHN's lisp in quite annoying as well . all in all the visuals are eye poping and the message is a good one .
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I purchased this external flash unit to use with my Nikon D5000.  The main reason I wanted an external flash was so I could angle the flash to the ceiling and bounce the light.  This unit works great.  It is lightweight, recycles quickly, and provides enough light to work well in most indoor settings.  I have also used it outdoors as a fill flash and it really helps there as well.  All in all, I am very pleased with it.  The only negative that I have encountered is that if you rotate your camera into a portait mode then your only option for bouncing the flash is off a side wall instead of the ceiling.
B000PC0U1W|4.0|I just got this movie a couple days ago, watched it during the weekend... I had forgotten how much I liked this movie. If you like conspiracy theories complemented with good action and a touch of \\"super hero\\", this is a great movie for you. The dialogs are superb and the actors really stand up to their characters.    If you have read the original graphic novel, you will find some differences in the movie, I guess this is expected as with all recent movie adaptations, but just be aware of that and do not hate the movie for it.    Blu-ray definitely has better exponents of its image capabilities, but this one does not let you down, just do not expect something like you see in Batman The Dark Knight, it is more like Batman Begins in Blu-ray.    Sound wise I cannot tell much, as my sound system is not that great, but I can tell that all dialogs, knife throwing/stabbing and explosions sounded very good, at least for me.    All in all, I had a great experience with this movie, I expect to watch this again very soon.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This CD is everything you need for a romantic or relaxed moment. Many covers, but also some new material makes this CD worthwile buying. My personal favorite is \\"All I do is dream of yoü\\" and \\"You've got what it takes\\".
B002RV01Q8|5.0|In 2001, Warner Music released an Enya music videos collection on DVD everywhere but the USA.  This DVD, titled Enya: The Video Collection, went out of print in Europe fast.  At the time, fans of Enya in the States had minimal information on when the DVD would get a release in this country.  One reason floated for why the plans for a release in the USA were scrubbed was that Nicky Ryan wanted the Enya DVD to have more than a LPCM audio track, he wanted Dolby 5.1.  This new DVD has audio in LPCM, Dolby 5.1 and DTS, but this DVD took eight years to get here in altered form.       What this DVD doesn't have are the videos Exile and Book of Days from the 2001 DVD, nor the documentary Enya-A Life in Music.  The missing Exile is no loss, it has too many close-ups of a moody Steve Martin from the movie L.A. Story, sometimes pontificating on the meaning of life.  The Enya documentary is something else, a class production that should be in the DVD, even if it is a little dated.    This Very Best of DVD is mostly a quality mastering job, but there are signs of corner cutting.  There are no English subtitles available, unlike the 2001 DVD.  Further, on Orinoco Flow, it seems that some technician did a cheap job transcoding a PAL video master to NTSC.  Playing the new DVD on my computer monitor, I see a slightly jagged border at the bottom of the frame.  Playing the Orinoco Flow video I copied from my Enya laserdisc Moonshadows onto DVD, the bottom of the frame is even. That 1991 laser also came with closed captioning.     This combination CD/DVD is a real bargain, having extra song tracks compared to the CD only release and having mostly crystal clear videos.  The two discs come in a mini-book instead of an Amaray case or jewel box.  The overhead photo of Enya on the outside box and on the minibook cover, with Enya centered in a gigantic red puffy dress, looks sort of strange, but that is no big deal.  I wish the record producers had done more than color the CD a chalky brightred and the DVD an off white color with the enya logo barely visible on the CD.  There is no accounting for taste.  The packaging of these discs is too minimalist for me.  Petty criticism aside, it is great to have these Enya videos finally available alongside a fine collection of Enya songs.
1577314808|1.0|egotistical attitude - read first few chapters, can't take anymore of it....get The Master Key by Charles F. Haanel instead.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|An alien ship lands on Johanessberg and somehow was shutdown for 20 years. The aliens inhabitting it got out of the ship with the help of humans only to be living afterwards in a huge slum area called District 9. One human working for the MNU (multinational united), which is an organizaiton responsible for communicating with aliens, gets infected by an alien substance that causes his body to gradually transform into an alien being. By that happening to him, he is the only human being able to operate on the aliens weapons and machines, and therefore became a  target for all human organizations and companies interested in learning alien technology. He became their target, at all costs.     This movie is different in the sense that it makes you side with the aliens against humans. You see the world through their eyes.   You also see that they are so fragile and weak without their technology, like humans.     The movie is ok, I justed hated the way the aliens looked. They looked like the starwars creatures of Tattoine. I would have appreciated it more if they looked like the alien being usually described by those claiming to have encountered them (tall, grey, with big eyes).
B002MW50KO|1.0|I can't really add anything not already written, but... I pre-ordered this, and took a break from work to listen, the moment it arrived.  What I mean is: I like Dylan, and I wanted to like this.  Alas, it was so bad it was embarrassing.  I felt like I was watching one of those terrible contestants on \\"The Gong Show\\", intentionally planted in the lineup so as to give the judges (and we viewers) someone to mock.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I listened enraptured at the beauty of Susan Boyle's voice. She \\"Dreamed a Dream\\" and God answered her prayer... to \\"be someone\\"as she promised her mother . I hope to hear more of her with songs that are upbeat along with her beautiful selection of slower-thoughtful songs. She has the kind of voice that would resonate on a Broadway stage. With the pathos that she gives for each selection... I can see her in a lead role. Susan Boyle... you are beautiful!!!!

B0018BB20W|5.0|\\"Nights in White Satin\\" and \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" should be enough to buy this album. But the whole album brings a feel from the beginning of a day to the end. Combining classical music and pop/rock with the influence of the 60's psychedelic feel to it. The Mellotron instrument really is a great sound. It is best listened to in a dark room and relaxing with it.
6305882592|5.0|I love this movie.  Its an hilarious, life-affirming story.  Difficult to say which scene is my favorite - they're all wonderful from the armless uncle to the cops.  Try it; you'll like it.
0307277453|4.0|I had to read this book for a college intro to bio class, and had very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that the book was actually rather enjoyable. Much of it is told in a story format so it is actually quite interesting, and I learned quite a bit just by paying attention to what I was reading. Obviously most casual readers aren't going to sit down with this book and read it through for fun, but It is written so that anyone with at least a very minimal knowledge of biology concepts could understand it. If you are looking for an entertaining yet educational book, I would recommend it.
B001493FK8|5.0|I lucked upon this series because I read comics and own the two GRRM's  Hedge Knight stories.  (See my Listmania comics list for more comics with mature themes, and heavy characterization).  They are worth reading if you love GRRM's work!  Read my review of that!<br />  It's hard to improve upon the two excellent 5 star reviews on here already by C Gustavson and M Belknap.  HOWEVER...the review you really need to read is posted under the book \\"A Clash of Kings,\\" the second book of this series.  Look for the 5 star review by Mister SVEM (sonofhotpie) titled \\"Superlative Series;  GRRM does it again!!!\\"<br />  That review has NO SPOILERS, and thoroughly lists what makes these books special and different, and who may enjoy them or not.  One thing I love about the story that I don't believe he mentioned is that the chapters are quite short, and they all have something important and gripping in them.  I am always disappointed when a character's chapter ends, `cause now I'm totally into it and want to keep following it!  Sometimes I even look ahead to see HOW LONG I must wait to hear more!!  LOL  And then with the next chapter it happens again!<br />Read it!  [[ASIN:0785127240 Hedge Knight TPB]]
0763619612|4.0|Another delightful story by Reynolds, in a very similar vein as <u>Ish</u> (which I absolutely adored!).    Here we find a young child who \\"Can't draw\\" anything.  Supposedly.  But when the teacher gets our protagonist to draw a dot and then \\"sign it\\" - well, one thing leads to another and the dots become more and more elaborate.    This is a great book to inspire creativity in kids who think they \\"can't\\" something.  If the beauty of art is in the eye of the beholder, then this illustrates that so long as you're enjoying creating the art, then that is what matters.    Again, the illustrations in this book are simple but fantastic, and they perfectly complement the text.    Personally, I enjoyed <u>Ish</u> more, but it could have been because I read it first.  I would most certainly recommend this book!
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|This is the first time I have written a review for a CD that I purchased through Amazon.  I waited for the best product that I could have purchased.  Whether you are a new fan of Michael Jackson or a seasoned one like myself, you will be so happy and glad you bought this item.  He is as brilliant on this CD as he was when he first started and I loved all the songs I heard and I could really appreciate them since I also saw the documentary, \\"This is It\\"?      This is a solid CD with loads and loads of tracks and good sounds and I loved it.  You will too.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Haven't actually watched yet as this is a Christmas gift. However, it arrived very quickly and I don't anticipate any problems as this is a brand new DVD set.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|If you are in the mood for something different in hip-hop (as I am) then buy this album.  If you looking for the same contrived, processed rigamarole then this album is definitely not for you.  Much like Kanye's 808s and Heartbreak, you have to be ready to open your mind and embrace something new.  If this doesn't sound like you, go and pick up 50's new album... I'm guessing that might be more your tempo.      With that said, Man on the Moon is an incredibly moody album.  It can be depressing yet enjoyable (oxymoronic, I know), but then flip the script and come off as upbeat yet laid back.  A number of the songs in the first half of the album have a sort of brooding vibe to them and give you an idea of who Cudi is as a person (check out \\"In My Dreams\\", \\"Solo Dolo\\", \\"Heart of a Lion\\") and throughout it continually crosses between moody, new-age hip-hop (\\"Soundtrack 2 My Life\\", \\"Day N Night\\", \\"Hyerr\\") and more upbeat tracks (\\"Enter Galactic\\", \\"CuDi Zone\\", \\"Make Her Say\\").    If you are ready for a journey, take the plunge and buy this album.  I personally enjoy Man on the Moon very much and I keep this CD in heavy rotation in my musical starting lineup.  Be ready for a departure from the norm, and please folks, embrace the martian...
1400063736|5.0|When you enjoy a novel so much that you're hunkered down under the covers with a reading light, trying not to wake your spouse while you finish the book, it's hard the next morning to think analytically about WHY you liked it. So-so books are easier to dissect. I recalled that the author of \\"Let the Great World Spin,\\"  Colum McCann, commented in an interview that the car crash depicted in the novel,  which impacts so many lives, is patterned, in its small way, on the destruction of the World Trade Center.  McCann said he was drawn to the way the fallen towers drew together people who, until linked by suffering, might otherwise have had nothing at all  in common. His statement helped me understand the genesis of the novel, but not why it is so good. However, I'll try.<br /><br />To me, it is McCann's use of detail, often the same detail repeated or changed slightly, that makes his characters so compelling. Jazzlyn, the teenaged prostitute who works in the shadows cast by the Major Deegan Expressway, is defined by the neon swimsuit she wears. When she is picked up in a police raid, it flashes beneath the coat her protector, Corrigan, has thrown over her. In court, Jazzlyn is inarticulate; her few words are inappropriate and reveal little about her. To the judge and to the onlookers, she is one more degraded woman in a weary procession. To the reader, however, the bathing suit suggests everything we know about her--her beauty, her youth, her recklessness. Her mother, Tillie, carries a pink parasol. It is by turns, coquettish, ironic (in the way it evokes the high class courtesan Tillie isn't), and, finally useless. It has no function as protection or even shade; Tillie can't protect herself, her daughter, or, in the end, her daughter's children. The Trade Center funambulist (tightrope walker) based on Philippe Petit is defined by his wire: the composition of it, the laying of it, the defects that can render it fatal, the precision of its tension. And Corrigan, the figure at the center of it all, speaks through his body: there is the thinness of his frame,  visible through the ragged collarless black shirt that hints at his religious vows, then the blotches on his body that signal disease,  and,  finally,  the image of those thin ribs pressed up against the steering wheel. All of the other characters in this polyphonic novel, in which characters appear and reappear, sometimes quite unpredictably, express more with their gestures, their clothing, their living rooms, all the  details of  their lives, than they ever do with words.<br /><br />The premise of \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is that people are bound to others in ways they can't always predict or even see. This is the motif created by the interwoven depictions of the high wire act, itself a blend of faith, crazy daring, and freedom. Sometimes in the novel fragile connections lead to a lessening of loneliness, sometimes they don't. I don't know if the novel's  premise is even true, but reading this book and its surprising ending, so far (and yet not so far at all) from its beginning pages, made me believe for a time that a wire could stretch between a drug-riddled housing project in the Bronx and an elegant apartment on Park Avenue.e center of it all, speaks through his body: there is the thinness of his frame,  visible through the ragged collarless black shirt that hints at his religious vows, then the blotches on his body that signal disease,  and,  finally,  the image of those thin ribs pressed up against the steering wheel.

A beautiful person inside and out-bravo to you, Susan! We love you!
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|The soundtrack for the movie plus the unfinished song he was working on with Art Garfunkle make for some great song bites as well as some complete songs.  What could make it better?  More complete songs, but the two disc version from Amazon more than beats the single disc version sold in most stores!  Two thumbs up for Amazon - more music and a better price!
1400063736|4.0|I finally got around to this year's National Book Award Winner.  For me, the NBA is hit and miss where I've loved some choices (Shadow Country), very much disliked some (The News From Paraguay) and felt neutral on others (The Echo Maker).    I liked Let The Great World Spin quite a lot.  This is despite the fact that I didn't like the structure of the novel very much.  The structure was very much like the movies \\"Crash\\" or \\"Babel\\" or \\"Traffic\\".  There are a series of stories of normally unrelated people who intersect over a period of time with an event linking these stories.  I find the format a bit gimmicky.    The binding event in Let The Great World Spin is a man who walks on a tightrope between the World Trade Center Towers in 1974.  It is another extraordinary event in New York.  The stories are of New Yorkers from various walks of life and backgrounds who either see or hear about the tightrope walker on that day.  The stories are not just limited to that day but all seem to come back to it.    There are quite a few stories told in the first person from different perspectives.  The first and probably most significant is of the Corrigan brothers from Ireland.  The key character is John Corrigan (Every one calls him by his last name, even his brother Ciaran).  Corrigan is someone searching for meaning in life.  He basically sacrifices his own comfort to help others.  He lives in the South Bronx and lets the local hookers use the washroom in his apartment.  He brings them coffee and is human to them.  He also helps out at the seniors home and is generally a force for good in the world.  He is unperturbed by pimps beating him up and all other forms of harsh circumstances.  He's a very unique and compelling character.    A second main thread tells of Claire a rich wife of a judge who lives in a Park Avenue Penthouse.  Her son has died in Viet Nam and she has bonded with several other mothers who have also lost sons.  She strikes up a particularly deepm realtionshipwith another woman who has lost three sons in Viet Nam.  Their friendship endures despite their very different backgrounds (Affluent White on Park Avenue vs non-affluent African American woman living in the SOuth Bronx.)    There are other story threads but generally they relate back to and cross with the first two stories.    Each story is very thoughtful and deals with a range of human emotions and circumstances.  The story is a very good slice of New York life in 1974.  Both the characters, the city and the time are the stars of the novel.    I enjoyed this a great deal and recommend it.  I do agree with other reviewers that it is a little slow at first but gets steadily better.    I'll definitely be watching for McCanns future work.
0156014041|5.0|The story has long been one of my favourites and when I found it in Latin I was delighted. Reading this was a pleasant trip down memory lane and having it in Latin not only gave it a new feel but also enabled me to discover some new aspects of the story. The language is straight forward and easy to understand. A great way to practice your language skills if you are past the second year of Latin.  If you are looking for something else with a similar level of difficulty you may like [[ASIN:1449563724 Historia Apollonii Regis Tyri (Latin Edition)]], if you are ready for something harder and more adventurous I can recommend [[ASIN:1449562671 Insula  Thesauraria (Latin Edition)]] and [[ASIN:1451564376 Pericla Navarchi Magonis (Latin Edition)]].

B002QY9RMA|3.0|I'm a Beyonce fan but it seems like every album she puts out I only like half the songs on the cd with the acception of her 2nd album.  This album to me was the worst. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad but compared to someone like Lauryn Hill the whole cd wasn't great.  On Lauryn Hill's 1st album all the songs on there were great, on Ledisi's cd all the songs were great, and on Leela James... well that whole cd was the s***!  I still like Beyonce but it's starting to seem like only a few songs on each album I love and the rest are ok.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I do not consider myself as a die hard Killers fan but after watching this DVD, I am now a true Victim! I saw snippets of this video in VH1 as a 30 minute teaser. Comparing that to the Blu-Ray version, Blu ray was definitely superior with the clarity of the images.  I could literally count the beads of sweat running of Flower's brow. Audio quality was good but I think I need to upgrade my soundsystem to fully appreciate the music.    A wonderful musical experience.  Can't wait for the Killers to come back home and see them live.!
B0000046X0|5.0|THIS is the kind of rock/jazz fusion (whatever you wanna call it) that 99% of the artists out there lack- intensity actually backed up with interesting instrumental chops.<br /><br />This album is AMAZINGLY good. I mean, good in a way that's beyond comprehension! Good in a way that I thought only the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Deep Purple and Santana were capable of!<br /><br />I'm having a bit of trouble understanding why Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy isn't frequently listed with some of the best albums of the 70's. Am I the only one hearing an *incredible* masterpiece of musical ideas? Am I the only one hearing band members completely on top of their game for this release?<br /><br />The other Return to Forever albums never came close to hitting me THIS hard. Some of the intensity is similar to Rainbow's classic Rainbow Rising however, that's mostly a rock album with elements of jazz- THIS album is more like a perfect combination of jazz and rock, played and executed near flawlessly and MUCH more aggressive than what normally qualifies as \\"jazz meets rock\\".<br /><br />Some of the dream-like keyboard playing might sound a bit stuck in the 70's, but who really cares? It's the same kind of keyboard playing that FLOORS me from the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Inner Mounting Flame.  The keyboards are so thick and tear through your skin, like you're supposed to be DRAWN to them... *darn* this kind of music impresses me so much!  The guitar workouts are right up there with the best John McLaughlin solos too.<br /><br />\\"Theme to the Mothership\\" will *blow your mind* if you're a Mahavishnu Orchestra or Deep Purple fan.  In fact the explosive keyboard jam is VERY reminiscent of the live version of \\"Space Truckin\\" from Deep Purple's famous Made In Japan album.  Now that's just *awesome* but believe me, it gets even better!  The guitar solos make even John McLaughlin himself rub his eyes and have to take a second look.  But my GOODNESS that keyboard jam... it's not just freakin' amazing but BEYOND comprehesion amazing.  A whole new category and definition of \\"amazing\\" has been invented thanks entirely to THIS ALBUM!  Oh, and in case you think that's the only example of sheer relentless explosiveness, guess again.<br /><br />\\"Captain Senor Mouse\\" contains the same exact furocious formula.  It doesn't let up at ALL for the entire 9 minutes so be prepared to be blown from here all the way to Shanghai China.  I seriously can't help but believe that the electric guitar jam is by FAR the heaviest of all 70's jazz/rock bands.  I mean it's played like a lightning storm coming down hard and heavy across the city and making people scatter!  \\"After the Cosmic Rain\\" starts off on a cautious note.  By \\"cautious\\" I mean, you KNOW the ominous guitar riff and gentle keyboards are leading into something intense.  Sure enough... *crank this song up loud*, haha.  The chaotic messiness of the drum work might seem out of place at first, but when you hear it following along to that creepy guitar riff you will NOT want to turn it off.  No way!  The keyboard jam near the end blows me to... not Shanghai.  We'll expand my geography and make this one New Brunswick.<br /><br />There's variety here too, folks!  It's not all fun and games (and memorable guitar/keyboard technical interplay!) You simply MUST check out the intro from \\"Space Circus\\".  It's dreamy Spanish loveliness.  Then it's funky groove time with a hint of Middle Eastern vibes.  This reminds me of the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Visions of the Emerald Beyond album.  \\"The Gamer Maker\\" could pass as another weak attempt at recapturing what my beloved Mahavishnu Orchestra did better a few years prior but... eh.  I love it too much to really lower my standards to such silly hogwash comparisons!  Oh the title song.  I should mention that one (even though it's just 3 minutes and 30 seconds long).  It's a brief instrumental with sprinkles and remnants of Jethro Tull.  I mean the main line of the song reminds me of the classic period of Tull.  I highly doubt these guys were soaking up Ian Anderson's folk tales while recording Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy.<br /><br />Intense, heavy, loud... these are just a few of the simple words that are perhaps TOO simple to really convince you how incredible Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy is. A must own.  I honestly have a really difficult time choosing between the Mahavishnu Orchestra's best work or this.  It's *really* close.  It's like being charged by two bulls at once- you know you're going to get hit *hard* and be down for the count.  I love Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy and I strongly believe you will too!  Make that a STRONG belief!<br /><br />So what *is* the best moment?  Wow, tough call there.  Too many to choose from!  If I had to pick 3 moments, I'd say the volcano exploding, lava rushing, earthquake rumbling, military solute that is the intro to \\"After the Cosmic Rain\\" is one of them, the relentless power-driven \\"heavy metal meets jazz\\" guitar solo from \\"Captain Senior Mouse\\" is another, and the well-executed eerie atmosphere leading into a frantic/worried pace of piano and guitar swirls from the intro to \\"The Game Maker\\" is the last mind-boggingly awesome moment.  On second thought, doesn't the intro to \\"After the Cosmic Rain\\" make you picture an asteroid heading directly for earth, and the bass giving off a feeling of the ground collapsing and crumbling?  AWESOME!  On a final note, I strongly recommend playing this album while a lightning storm is building across the country mountains on a warm summer evening or better yet -like I found myself doing earlier this year- playing it *while* the lightning is banging and clanging outside.  Best album ever?  You bet!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Micahael Buble quite simply sets a new standard for instant classics with this album.  Every cut is exceptional, fresh and memorable with outstanding orchestrations and original stylings.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase one track or the whole album.
0385504225|5.0|\\"Lost Symbol\\" was an amazing achievement; this book was worth reading for the ending, I was shocked, at the ingenuity of Dan Brown..(I won't tell the ending)  Yes, this book was adventurous, enlightening, and a tremendous read..  Thank you, Dan Brown for writing it..
0739385852|5.0|David Almond gives an exceptional reading of his wonderful story. This tenth anniversary edition is enhanced by music from the fantastic opera of Skellig by Tod Machover. The opera's premiere last year at the SAGE was the musical event of the season. I hope it enters the repertoire soon.
0060935464|5.0|Every time the name of this book came up, I would wrinkle my nose and shake my head \\"no\\" in response to the question \\"Have you read it?\\".  It's amazing how false perceptions about things can keep something that really is good out of your life.<br /><br />A few months ago I decided to finally start opening up and reading some of the books that have always been touted as \\"required reading\\" for schools.  Being homeschooled, I was never required to read any particular books - and as I read quite voraciously, it was never really an issue.<br /><br />A few months ago I read The Catcher in the Rye and did not see what the big issue was.  It was okay, but not the best thing I'd ever read and I was far from astounded by it.  With that further prejudice in mind I approached To Kill a Mockingbird with not a little bit of hesitation.<br /><br />I was sucked in almost immediately though.  I could picture the town, the setting.  I could see Scout clearly and found myself catching my breath and blinking back tears more than a few times.  I fell in love with Atticus - what an incredible man he was in this story.  I loved the quirks and the twists, the \\"spooky\\" nature of Boo, I cried at the story of Tom Robinson and I cheered at the dismal ending to Bob Ewell.<br /><br />But most of all, I felt ashamed of myself.  Shame that I had let something silly like enjoying the shock people had when I told them I hadn't read this book - keep me from reading this book.  Truth be told, I denied myself something pretty special and I plan to make up for it by reading this one again and again.
0790749815|4.0|Very satisfied with the quality of the product, expecially the age of the movie digitally remastered. Ran perfect on my dvd player.
1416914307|5.0|So, I wasn't really sold on this trilogy until this book.  Then .. wow, it was like someone hit Clare upside the head and made her realize what she needed to do.<br /><br />Fast-paced, full of interesting twists and turns (predictable, yes..but still good, all the same), answers given at a great pace (not all at once, but spaced nicely apart), great character development for the main characters.. really fun, interesting, absorbing reading.<br /><br />This last book convinced me to actually purchase the set.  Fun, fun book and good ending* to the series.<br /><br />*Although I've heard now she has a new Mortal Instruments book coming out in 2011.  Argh. So far away.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life [Blu-Ray]<br /><br />  This review is strictly for the blu-Ray. I have seen the remastered 60th Anniversay edition and now the the blu-ray 2009. The picture is stunning on the Blu, and should be owned by all, for a feel good movie that can be scary real @ times...
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I wasn't going to order this for my wife- I knew what I was in for.  \\"Why don't you put Elf on for me?\\" every night- but I can't say no to her, you know?  So now I know the lines to this think like I did for Princess Bride and 16 Candles, back in high school-<br /><br />And there are some great lines!<br /><br />\\"You sit on a throne of lies!\\"<br /><br />\\"Watch out for the yellow ones, they don't stop!\\"<br /><br />\\"Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?\\"<br /><br />\\"My finger has a heart beat.\\"<br /><br />\\"Have you seen these toilets? They're GINORMOUS!\\"<br /><br />This movie is sweet, goofy, funny, innocent and joyful- everything you want in a Christmas movie.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is fantastic as Buddy the Elf.  This was the movie that really turned me around on him- he really nails this role- before this movie I always thought he was just massively annoying.<br /><br />Bob Newhart is great, of course.  I used this movie as an excuse to make my wife watch some of his older stuff, particularly his great sit-coms from the seventies and eighties.<br /><br />This is where I first met Zooey Deshanel.  What a delight she is!  She has a bit of a hipster/indie edge, without being off-putting.<br /><br />And the Louie Prima songs are a great touch- who would have thought to use Louie Prima in a Christmas movie?  But it works!<br /><br />The infinifilm stuff is a  bit annoying.  I won't be buying any more of these- it's an interesting idea, but it doesn't really work.<br /><br />This movie works for the whole family - young kids to oldest adults - and it has enough odd ball moments that it bears repeated re-watching.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|U2 is my favorite music. Went to see them in Chicago September 12 and have tickets to see them in East Lansing.  They are simply the best!  This remaster is wonderful. I had the original version and found this to be worth it with the book and the additional music. Love U2!
B002XSP16A|5.0|I knew I would love this cd...her voice is amazing and she sings from her heart. WONDERFUL
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is an excellant buy. Amazing photography and very interesting. Blu-ray is a must for this purchase.  A+
B001U887OM|5.0|Nice and comfortable. Easy on and off. Shipped quickly and well packaged. A very nice way to shop.
0061703257|4.0|This book was recomended by a friend. It was a fast read..until the end, then things turned strange. Its hard to review when the ending is up for graps as this books ending is. If the movie says true to form it should be very good. It may shake you up a bit !  Fun read..
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan's music literally brought me to tears. The most beautiful music I have heard in a long time. She will be remembered as one of the greats
0735619670|5.0|After I finished reading a few chapters, I thought \\"ah, I knew about this already. There is nothing new.\\" Then when I moved on to other chapters and I learned a lot of new stuffs that are of tremendous help. Then I realised, this book is so practical that it covers many of the mistakes made and learned by experience programmers as I did in some of the areas but not the others.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book. The contents are well-explained in a simple manner with lots of real-life experience and numbers that support the coding practise recommended by the author. Regardless of what programming langauges you use, you should be able to follow the book fairly easily as the content of the book applies to general programming practise despite some chapters are dedicated to object-oriented.<br /><br />You wanna know what makes a professional programmer? You'll find the answer in this book.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Who wouldn't like Snow White!?!? Blue ray is fantastic!!! She is my favorite princess.. oh, my Granddaughter loves it too!!!!
B000ZN8036|3.0|Rich boy scorns hard-working parents, longs to live a \\"real\\" life and not waste it like other sheep who follow the norm and -- horrors! -- follow the rules. Interesting that only young rich white men have this particular chip on their shoulders; a moving movie about a spoiled, unwise, arrogant young man who ironically does nothing but waste his life.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|I love this album. A friend who did not know about Norah Jones asked me if Norah is a perfectionist. I told her that she has to be to make an album like this. She seems relaxed, but some serious thought went into this music. The marketing is also interesting. This will make for a great Christmas present for many people.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Like many people I was moved and swept away by Boyle's appearance on \\"Britains Got Talent\\".  After awhile, though, I found it all a bit uncomfortable because SHE appeared to not be used to such a limelight.  All I can say is I am thrilled this woman went on to make this album.  It is one excellent song after another.  The song that was written for her is one of the most moving of the whole lot. I hope Boyle makes more music.  We can all use a little Susan in our lives.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I have all of his cd's and this does not disappoint. I was unsure how this would compare to \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" and I was pleasantly surprised. He adds a new flavor to his music and I promise that if you are already a fan or just starting to listen that this cd will soon become one of your favorites.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Just received my Susan Boyle CD the other day.  It is great.  My husband and I've listened to it a number of times.  It never fails to give me goosebumps.  Susan is an awesome singer.  We want more!!!! Please
B002C6K7N0|4.0|With Megadeth's newly released album, Megadeth has shown signs of reverting back to their glorious days, but is not quite there. Endgame, Megadeth's twelfth album, became one of the highly anticipated metal albums of 2009, since the beginning of the year.    Founded in 1983, the American metal band Megadeth rose to fame in the music industry with their twelve albums and numerous concerts, including international. Credited for creating the thrash metal genre, Megadeth is recognized as one of \\"the Big Four of Thrash Metal\\".   First, Dave Mustaine, Megadeth's frontman, refined his vocals since 2001, with their album The World Needs a Hero. Sure, Mustaine aged and lost his signature yell, but he has transformed into a storyteller who can convey his message.   The transformation bothered even the most loyal fans of Megadeth, with Mustaine taking a unique step. But like previous albums, Endgame delivers a message to United States about potential corruption, along with other fascinating topics, an absent factor in their last CD.   Megadeth's trend for previous years turned into Mustaine singing in a disgruntled voice, and the rest of the band playing quick tempos and rapid solos. This style is impressive, especially with the new guitarist Chris Broderick, yet it causes the album to sound repetitive.   Megadeth used the style in the group's previous album United Abominations, making Endgame seem like a mere sequel. Frankly, there were few changes to the mood, too few to call Endgame a classic for years to come.      Endgame is not an awful album at all. In fact, it is one of the finer CDs I have recently heard. Chris Broderick is arguably the best guitarist Megadeth has hired, and Dave has really achieved a notable vocal style again. The two improvements are certainly a start.   For metal enthusiasts, buying Endgame is a must, as an album this impressive will not come for several years.    Megadeth simply faces a stage of \\"experimentation\\", which many bands have faced, especially since 2000. With time, it is possible that a new Rust in Peace, a fan favorite, could be composed with their notable progress.
068485743X|4.0|I just recently purchased this book. I was excited when I received it but after reading it a little the excitement passed. Not because the book is poorly written or not helpful, but because the book is best read after you've completed your manuscript. I'm looking for something to help me before I start my manuscript.      I'm not upset that I purchased the book because it will come in handy when I start the revising and submission process. The thing that I like about the book is that it nit picks and makes you focus on the smallest details. It tells you to pay attention to things that you'd never put thought to like paper color when submitting your manuscript. While also pointing out how to fix flaws in your writing. I think anyone who desires to become an established author should look into purchasing this book.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Just got my copy and love it.In my opinion the best since dirt.The melodies are eerily similar to Layne singing though not as powerful throughout.The guitar work is also slightly understated,but beautiful.Check my brain sounds just like old AIC and A looking in view is awesome as well.If you like AIC you'll love this.
B001TOD92C|5.0|If you haven't seen \\"The Wrestler\\" yet go watch it on HBO or buy the DVD. This is by far the most honest drama ever made. The first thing you will notice is the camera work. It's mostly done in a hand-held style reminiscent of documentaries. The second thing you'll notice is how Rourke just immerses himself in the role. There are little touches and details that you won't see in the vast majority of films. Marisa Tomei (gorgeous as always) plays a stripper in her mid or late 40's. And there's a scene where she's crawling along the catwalk and you can see the stretchmarks on her body giving away her age. In 90% of Hollywood films, they would have edited them out. The scene where Rourke breaks down and says he's \\"just a broken down piece 'a meat\\", that is just one of the top tear-jerker scenes and somewhat reminiscent of Brando in \\"On the Waterfront\\".  Despite nobody acknowledging this, \\"The Wrestler\\" is based on the life of Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts. If you watched \\"Beyond the Mat\\" (1999) there are many parallels including the wrestlers troubled relationship with his daughter and inability to deal with his faded glory.  Why are you still reading this? Go buy it!
0802136834|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a while. I have always been interested by this time period, and King Henry VIII in particular, but was even more intrigued after becoming addicted to The Tudors television series.  After watching the first two seasons (currently waiting for the third to come out on dvd) I decided to read this book and was pleased to find that The Tudors, looks aside, is pretty darn historically accurate.        The book itself is very entertaining and informative and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves The Tudors or is a history fan. Actually, you don't even have to be a history fan, anyone who loves a good book about love, lust, deceit and all of the intricacies of human emotion will love this book.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Dear Susan,<br /><br />I bought this cd partly because of your voice and because of the person you were when you stepped out on the American Idol stage.  The cd is very, very good but I am sure you will top this many times over.  My fondest wish is that you stay the same person that you were from the beginning.  Best wishes for a long and successful career.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|The 80's never looked better.  Bouncing Snyth sounds mixed in with that signature 80's drumbeat and some catchy hooks are all front and center here.  The obvious influence in this CD is fully embraced and its better off for that.  La Roux has a thin but commanding voice.  Watching the video to \\"Bulletproof\\" is a great peek into the rest of the album.  Highly recommended for fans of fun pop the way it was back then, with a modern twist.
B002GZQYMK|2.0|The first few tracks sound like late-period U2.  Track four sounds like Queen, and track five sounds like Ultravox.  By the time track eight -- which is a real keeper -- comes around, you're just too depressed to care....and too underwhelmed to chalk up this groovy aberation to anything other than dumb luck.  Enjoy!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Probably the best rock concert music and light show I've ever heard/seen.  Worth the price of admission.
B0002XV30Q|5.0|these cd's are very interesting. Saint saens aren't the greatest composer that existed but his music is aways very clear and elegant. Collard is a great player mainly of French music.
B00122J0YW|5.0|This album is truly one of those that will define the sound of 80's music for all time. There is so much I can say that has already been said so if anything I'm just here to add more fuel to the fire. \\"Live To Tell\\" may forever be my favorite song by Madonna. It is truly a deep and melodic song that is accompanied by an album of equal stature.
B000YDOOU0|4.0|Must admit that this album was very standard Pat Metheny. Although very good it is not out of the ordinary.
B002LW9ITY|5.0|This DVD and Blu-Ray set was a great buy! I love the fact that it has both formats especially since I don't yet own a Blu-Ray player but plan to purchase one soon! Disney really knows what they're doing packaging both formats together! Cars is a great movie to watch again and again!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe B. has made the big time with his appearance at the Royal Albert Hall and the release of this DVD.  He has earned it.  I won't tell you I'm a music critic, but I do know what I like. And I love this release.  Everything fits where it should.  The band members are poetry in motion. Joe plays and feels each note from a place so deep inside, the guitar simply becomes part of him. The sound, the camera work, the lighting, the directing, the editing, are simply as good as it can get.  If this DVD doesn't take you to the stage with the group, it will certainly plant you front row center in the audience.  Caution: Be prepared for goosebumps and an uncontrolable compulsion to bang your head.  Still rockin' at 58, playin' guitar since I was 13. Dues paid in full........
B00204AA0O|5.0|The only way I think I can sum up the way she sings is with this. You know when your little cousin or niece comes over, sits at your piano, and starts banging on it while singing some very strange sentences. It's like that, but superb. I truely enjoy her singing and the use of the piano, which feels like it has its own personality, if that makes sense.    Relating to the songs, for most CDs I have bought, I listen to it through once and then only re-listen to the few I liked. This is not the case here. Truely a joy to my ears the entire way through.
B0026P3G12|2.0|Susan Boyle has a pleasant, clear amateur voice and her interpretations are passable, but she is by no means a great singer. Listen to her carefully, and you'll hear wobbly pitch, uncertain breath control, and phrasing that is a pale imitation of classic artists like Julie London and Mahalia Jackson. The selection of songs on this CD is similarly lacking in quality control. It's a hopelessly sentimental grab-bag of showtunes, jazz and pop standards, religious anthems, and a Christmas carol for Chrissakes! Both she and her album are being aggressively hyped and aggravatingly overrated by the same horde of screaming fans that made her so hard to hear on TV. But then she and her producer, professional jerk Simon Cowell, can't be blamed for making the most of her popularity among those with unsophisticated tastes. So if this homely, very modestly talented \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" contestant inspires you to \\"dream a dream,\\" go ahead and buy her album. Just don't imagine it possesses any more musical validity than the production of any other flash-in-the-pan pop star.
B000RIWAVW|3.0|I like the Halloween story line. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. However, I was disappointed that it shows nudity. One of the girls boobs are showing several times. Why Hollywood thinks they have to put nudity in all the time is beyond me. I think it ruins the film. Otherwise, it's a great horror flick. Love the theme song. It is so fitting.
B000005L86|5.0|I'm not exactly a reggae expert, but I do have dozens of reggae albums in my collection.  My top three personal favorites are, in ascending order, \\"Catch A Fire\\" by the Wailers, \\"Marcus Garvey\\" by Burning Spear and \\"Heart of the Congos\\".  If you are a reggae fan, get these three albums NOW.  If you are interested in reggae and would like to explore a bit, get these three albums NOW.  If you don't like reggae but you just want to look cool when your friends scan your music collection, get these three albums NOW.  \\"Heart of the Congos\\" in particular is an otherworldly masterpiece, and your life is not complete without it!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Well, December is here, and it's now time to ramp up the anticipation for one of the most cherished holidays of all. You got it. It's time to dust off some DVD cases and get into the holiday spirit. And boy do we have a wide variety! There are dozens of films that we can enjoy watching during any time of December. Home Alone, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, A Christmas Story, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street, and even Ernest Saves Christmas are ideal motion pictures for this time of year. Many people, however, consider It's A Wonderful Life to be the finest Christmas film, and it's not hard to see why. It's a loose adaptation of Philip Van Doren Stern's short story called \\"The Greatest Gift,\\" and it tells of how wonderfully important your life really is, not only to yourself but to everyone that's close around you. It's well directed by Frank Capra, and it's one of the excellent motion pictures that that can really get you in the mood for the holiday spirit. Here's hoping that this movie will really last forever.<br /><br />Grade: A
B001FB55HQ|3.0|I WAS REALLY UPSET THAT THE LATEST DVD RELEASE OF TERMINATOR SALVATION DID'NT HAVE THE BONUS FEATURES ON IT. I DON'T LIKE FACT THAT THE DVD SALES MARKETING IS SHOVING BLUE RAY DVDs AND THAT OBNOXIOUS SECOND DISC OF DIGITAL COPIES DOWN OUR THROATS. WHY ARE YOU GOING TO PAY EXTRA FOR A DIGITAL COPY DISC IF YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO USE THE DVD MOVIE ONLY?     I ALWAYS BUY DVD WITH BONUS FEATURES BECAUSE IT GOES OVER HOW THE MOVIE WAS MADE AND INTERVIEW WITH THE ACTORS AND OTHER MOVIE EXTRAS.  THE DVD SALES MARKETERS ARE GOING TO LOSE MONEY IN THE NEAR FUTURE IF THEY START AND CONTINUE TO DO THIS.    AS FAR AS THE MOVIE IS CONCERNED IT WAS GIVEN A 3 STAR RATING BY ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A LITTLE BETTER. THE ACTION SCENES WERE TO A MINIMUM AND IT DRAGGED AT TIMES. I'M A BIG TERMINATOR FRANCHISE FAN SINCE ITS FIRST RELEASE IN 1985. I JUST THOUGHT IT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER.
0756655730|5.0|DK Prehistoric Life has it all.  There are hundreds of illustrations.  The text is concise and informative.  The book explains the formation of the earth, traces the origin of life, through multicelled organism, the Burgess Shale and Cambrian explosion of life forms, age of reptiles and the evolution of man.  A discription of the plant kingdom is also given.  The book explains fossil formation, how fossils are dated and the different geological periods. Each geological period is marked with mass extinctions.  The permian-triassic boundry at 251 million years ago was the worst all mass extinction.  This period started the age of the giant reptiles.  This book is packed with all types of facinating information.  The 12 by 15 inch book makes a great center piece for sitting on a coffee table and is sure fire way to intiate conversations.

B002HNA9LS|5.0|This is the collection of collections. This collection goes back to the origins of Classical Music. The recording quality, the performers, the performance, the packaging, the literature are all top notch. I really doubt that  website will ever be surppased. If you like classical music just buy it! I just keep playing it and my wife usually does the same. Just go for it!    20jan2010  It seems that some people do not like my opinion about this collection. First of all, I bought this collection in a European website on a pre release order. Second, if you take all the Cd's sleeves and put them in  order they become a beautiful painting which isn the sameone used as bookcover for the 203 pages booklet that comes with the collection. Also, you should really listen to CD number 3,tittled \\"The Birth of Polyphony\\" song number 5 \\"Kyrie\\". This song principal voice is Sister Marie Keyrouz. Sister Keyrouz have never performed in the USA. Pay attention to her. For me this track is the Grand Prize of the collection. The only do not like piece, which I believe that should not have been included is   The Brenstein Mass Cds 27 and 28.    However, I stand behind my initial comments, \\"This is the collection of collections...\\" I bought it but not at Amazon.com

B002M3GPOI|5.0|\\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" has always been one of my top ten albums. It started the whole prog rock scene , and has not a single wasted moment on it. I have literally listened to this recording at least once a month for the past 40 years.  So what is so special about this 40th anniversary reissue , and is it worth the $$$$ ?    You get the 2009 Stereo mix by Porcupine Tree genius (and Crimson fan) Steven Wilson              Original Master Edition from 2004              The original mono album mix for US radio promos              The alternate takes mixed for the first time from the original studio recordings              The de-clicked vinyl transfer of the original stereo pressing    PLUS : Live 1969 recordings of key period tracks         The mono single mix of \\"The Court Of The Crimson King\\" radio US promo only         10 Bonus track versions of demos , BBC recordings , alternate mixes , duo versions and instrumentals     AND : a DVD which feature MLP lossless 5.1 Surround mix        MLP Lossless Stereo of the 2009 stereo mix , the original master edition from 2004 , the alternate album,        and additional audio content     PLUS : Video of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\"      And the sound is phenomenal (aside from the boot live recordings)      Is it too much material devoted to a single album ?  Judge for yourself. I say not. I only know from here on out , it is going to be a BEAR to decide upon which version I will listen too.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Very cute movie, entertaining and even a useful story line. My 2 and 3 year old boys are obsessed. I hope they come out with a 2nd one that is just as good as the first!
B002NWRMVS|5.0|At first, I thought the lyrics were nonsense - but I soon found myself listening to all the songs over and over again! The instrumentals are, in themselves, worth the listening. If Norah Jones sung in a language I did not understand; I would still listen to her renderings. She moves my soul.     Such a great artist!
B0000042HV|5.0|While studying to perform the 8th Shostakovich quartet, I borrowed several recordings. On the basis of the reviews at this site I purchased the Fitzwilliam recording. In my opinion it is far and above superior to the others recordings available, with Kronos also worth a mention. Comparing this recording to some of the other popular suggestions found at this site, I was happy to find that the Fitzwilliam does not \\"edit\\" Shotsakovich's score-- no added dynamics or articulations. Tempo markings are true. Technically they are wonderful, the blend and voicing is exceptional. The interpretation is austere but remains powerful and hauntingly memorable because of it. Many recordings are credible, but this recording has me wanting to listen over and over. I think the Fitzwilliam is on a different plane from all the rest. Highly reccomended.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a voice!  What a pleasure to just relax and listen to a genuine artist - the purity of her vocals - the assortment of selections - the renditions of How Great Thou Art, Amazing Grace, Silent Night are clear and heartfelt - maybe a classic hymn  album next?  No female vocalist can even come close to her perfect phrasing and pitch - so satisfying. She sings from the heart with a certain humbleness and passion - that's the secret?  I could also add the word confidence.<br /><br />Who can ever forget that look of shock on the faces of the judges and audience when she first sang \\"I Dreamed A Dream!\\"  This song, and the other selections she loves and chose for her first album do not disappoint - Merry Christmas and a bright New Year, Susan Boyle!  Sing on!  You are a breath of fresh air.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Each music video relays a definite art concept or ideology everyone, irrespective of background is able to relate to. I'm convinced that no artist has been or will be able to equal or better Madonna.    I feel, however that Her Celebration Collection would have been that much more complete if She had included \\"Bad Girl\\", \\"Love don't live here anymore\\" and \\"nothing really matters\\".    However, this item should be owned by all lovers of great music and artistry!
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|\\"This is It!\\"  is excellent.  I saw the movie and sat in awe.      It is so very sad that Michael was so misunderstood.  He was a precious, peaceful intelligent soul.      Michael was a genius.  He was music...really...he 'was' music!  The world continues to hurt the innocent.    Michael is truley missed.  I pray he is with God and at peace.  I also pray that he is able to see how loved and missed he is.
0142001104|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was an eye opener for me and gave me some different perspectives about day to day occurances and how to deal with situations and people better.
0307588335|4.0|I've heard that other books (Murder of Lehman Brothers-?) offer a better accounting of the facts behind the Lehman collapse, but this was an entertaining audio-book read which kept me occupied during a long car ride. It not only covers the Lehman collapse iteself, but also the general events surrounding the economic Armageddon we are still slugging through, including the aftermath and kangaroo-court bankruptcy trial in NYC. This event allowed for the executive branch to take over a significant chunk of the economy with little public understanding of the situation or debate, and the author's discussion of the events surrounding those fateful days are a compelling read. At least the politicians were not made to sound like heroes, but the author is somewhat charitable in his characterization of Henry Paulson as a free marketer (HA!). Also noteworthy was the authors early story about his web site, 'convertbond dot com,' which was bought out by Morgan Stanley at its peak.<br /><br />Hence, for entertainment value and a reasonable summary of events, I think it was worth the price. But regarding the authors role, there are some conspicuous questions.<br /><br />Number one, he disdains the \\"bodybuilder\\" real estate salesmen in California for making a fast buck when the getting was good. He claims disgust at their allegedly dishonest tactics and utter ruining of many families while raking in cash. In fact, I sensed raw envy coupled with cultural elitism. The author was a degreed professional, not some nouveau riche white trash meathead. But were all of these salesmen totally dishonest? By the authors own description, things were so easy in the mortgage and housing business back then that they really didn't need to cheat. That was left up to the buyers themselves who filled out the liars loans to qualify for the property. Frankly, I'm a little tired of hearing about 'predatory lenders' - what about the predatory borrowers who should have known they could not afford a $400k McMansion on a pizza delivery job? But I digress.<br /><br />The author blames the bodybuilder salesmen for taking advantage of a hot real estate market. Well, um, DUH they're real estate salesmen, not financial advisors - what did he expect them to do? So long as they did not commit fraud against the banks or the buyers (and some did this, no doubt), who could blame them for making hay while the sun shined? The author was no different than the bodybuilders, he just thought of himself as a higher order. He stayed in the game right up until he was canned. Later in the book, he talked about his millions in Lehman options going up in smoke after the collapse, but I bet he's still pretty comfy, financially; even more so after the release of this book. Who paid for all that? Was it not made possible by products he sold, which were directly connected to the bodybuilders? If he were so repulsed by what he saw when visiting California he should have left the trading business altogether. Instead, he sounded a bit sad when it all fell apart. Sorry Larry, you can't have your cake and eat it too.<br /><br />Number two, the writing style, as another reviewer pointed out, was probably made to make the author sound a lot cooler than he really is (and to have us believe he really went around declining chances to bang hot CNBC anchors). The vapid military analogies and comparisons of his dad to John Wayne were undoubtedly the product of the co-author who writes books about SEALS (coincidence?). But it probably did make it more interesting to read about what might be an otherwise dull subject and perhaps even duller people. One look at the picture of the author and you can tell he wasn't getting any girls without that fat Lehman check and a few cocktails at a pricey Manhattan bar. Hey, if a few creative metaphors can make you sound like a financial Brad Pitt, go for it I guess.<br /><br />Finally, the stories surrounding authors early life gave me mixed feelings. The part about his growing up in a bad part of Worcester Mass was well told and worth the price of the book. I absolutely loved the detail of the time, place and events. Having grown up not far from there around the same time as the author, it was a very welcome treat. That location (Lincoln Village) really was a total drug and crime infested dump! Conveniently enough however, the author blames his less than stellar academic performance on his unfortunate location, and not because he was lazy or not so bright. Though I don't think he's stupid, teenage lazyness is not out of the question. I guess we have to take his word that his bad academic performance and inability to score an ivy league slot was beyond his control yet within his mental ability.<br /><br />Overall, there may be better books as far as complete factual accounts, but thanks to some creative co-writing, this might be a better read for the non-professional financial reader.ter Mass was well told and worth the price of the book.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|This movie is great!  It was recommended to me by a friend.  I got it on Netflix and then had to buy this one for my collection.  It's a great love story, without the use of drugs, alcohol, prostitution, etc.  It is a genuine love story and the struggle for one to come to terms that he's gay.  I highly recommend it!!!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Very few artists can legitimately be called prophets. (He would probably not accept such a label, but that does not make it any less accurate.) Rarer still comes a stellar archive of just such an artist in the act of completing what is perhaps the pinnacle of his life's work. I was not a longtime fan of Leonard Cohen going into this performance. What little I knew of him came mostly from reading the songwriting credits on Judy Collins' \\"Wildflowers\\" album. I was left speechless by the end of the show. This DVD is truly a masterpiece. The artistic depth on all levels is staggering... the wise old man with so much spirit pouring out of his soul, his band of visionaries creating such beautiful sounds around his poetry. Everyone in the arena is eternally grateful, especially the artists themselves, and it's akin to a truly deep, life-changing religious experience for all. Hallelujah! (BTW: The audio-visual quality of the DVD is as good as anything currently available... thank you so much for doing it right! )

B002HWUU2C|4.0|Bought this for my husband for his birthday. He was an inspired fan of the film they made and enjoyed the music, both as a listener and as a fellow musician.  He has enjoyed this album thoroughly though the dvd would not play on our computer.  The cd gets a lot of play in the car and in the apartment. I think we both agree we'd like to hear more of this duo with his band. The tracks featuring the whole lot of them were awesome.  Two thumbs up for us indie listeners. I'd recommend this one.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|I love Alice in Chains, but that was the diverse Alice in Chains with its original lead singer. The lead singer that has long ago past on and ever since there have been a \\"best of\\" CDs, a live CD and a three disc boxed set. Not too much else. The guitarist Jerry Cantrell had his solo career and the songs for this album were written by him.    Now ten years too late, Alice in Chains has found a new lead singer that sounds similar to the old singer, which is a great thing. His voice is a great buzz saw through songs, the vocals have power with a somber edge. The entire CD is long, slow with churning guitars that make each song feel longer than they need to be.    The band ten or fifteen years ago made the 7-9 minute songs seem like a joy to listen to, but this is just a real chore. Slow churning guitars, whailing riffs and somber lyrics are a great thing, but not when its done the entire 55 minute CD. Of course if that's your thing, you'll be in heaven, but I just miss the diversity that the original band used to have.
1563899426|4.0|What happens when Jack the Giant Killer reports that Rose Red, Snow White's sister, has disappeared from her apartment and said apartment is coated with several pints of Rose's blood?  Why, you call in the Big Bad Wolf, or Bigby Wolf, as he's known to the inhabitants of Fabletown.<br /><br />This is a fascinating look at what might happen if the fables and fairy tales we grew up on were really true and if the characters in the fables and fairy tales had been forced out of their lands by an evil simply known as the Adversary.  They would end up in New York (of course!) and would try to get by without letting the Mundanes know of their existence.  In Fabletown, King Cole is the Mayor, but Snow White, the deputy Mayor, is really the one in charge.  There's Beauty and the Beast.  Prince Charming, Snow's ex, makes an appearance, and he's as shallow as he is charming.<br /><br />And of course, there's the crime.  Is it a murder?  There's too much blood for anyone to have survived it.  Who could have done it?  The suspects are many - from Bluebeard, to Jack the Giant Killer, to Snow White herself.<br /><br />This is not a child's book, by the way.  The F-word makes a couple of appearances, and the fairy tales are apparently all grown up.  But this is fun reading and a great idea.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />And the short story at the end is very good as well.
B002PL8SWY|5.0|The Rolling Stones Get Yer YaYas Out has be regarded as the best live album of all time. There are other great ones but YaYas rocks from start to finish and best of all it's pure live raw rock! This new 40th Annivesery edition sounds incriedibly better than ever. The DVD has previously unreleased tracks that never circulated before and excellent quality. Satisfaction is worth the price of this boxed set. A big advantage of getting the box set with the LPs is that you get the big booklet with it where as the CDs only comes with  small booklet. The LP version is even more collectible. If you have YaYas and love it, go for this upgrade and you won't be sorry.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I have heard Norah's earlier releases, yeah, the stuff that won all the grammy awards, and...yeah, she's great.  But this is the first release stocked with her own songs, and with the sound quality that her music merits.  In this recording I hear a talent who comes from the place where the real stuff comes from.  She will grow and she will change and she will mature, and I will always be listening. And thank you Blue Note, this is an audiophile recording, or at least an A-, which puts it in the top 10% of CDs.  When I heard this I bought all her earlier stuff, and was crushed to discover that to my ears it is unlistenable on sound quality alone.  Thank you Norah for this release, I hope your technical people will continue to treat your music right in the future. Norah plays some classics on the earlier releases, and sure they're great songs, but her own songs in her own voice shine dark and sweet and subtle here.  I will always think of this as Norah's first album.
0440246164|5.0|I've read most of John Grisham's works, and started to grow weary of the legal thriller format a few years back....  I reluctantly purchased The Partner and must say that I am quite happy to have acquired it.. It's a wonderful read, great characters, good solid plot and it \\"flows\\" well...  I heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a way to spend a couple of days...
B00018D44U|1.0|I love Norah, but the quality of this recording is a crime against her music.  Do yourself a favor and get Not Too Late with her own songs and a decent recording from Blue Note, and wait for the remaster release of this recording.  Yuck.  Jeez.
B00005N5S2|4.0|General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was a great figure in American history, a character who has been tarnished by liberals because of his supposed disobedience to President Truman. His story is truly staggering.<br /><br />If anything, this movie is not long enough nor provides enough connectivity to establish a running narrative. The action (in the film) begins in 1942 as the end is nearing in the Phillipines in the face of an invasion by Imperial Japanese forces. One weakness of the movie is that it doesn't discuss Mac prior to this point in his life. MacArthur was a highly successful field commander in WWI. He was made superintendent of West Point. He was the controversial commander who sent troops to sweep away the \\"bonus marchers\\" from Washington D.C. He was made Chief of Staff of the Army. After he retired from the Army he was made Field Marshal of the Phillipine Army, which was just then being organized. All this and more takes place before the curtain is ever raised.<br /><br />In any case, the movie does follow MacArthur as he is forced to leave the Phillipines and the army under his command to its fate. Once in Australia he discovers that the U.S. government has no intention of attempting to recover the Phillipines. Despite this, MacArthur manages to turn the war in the Pacific around, engineering an offensive which would take him back to the Phillipines, as he promised.<br /><br />Next is the period in which MacArthur served as the supreme allied leader in Japan, working with the Japanese to liberalize and democratize its society. This is an achievement in itself and one hardly ever recognized.<br /><br />Finally is Korea, the conflict that would eventually get him removed from command. The back-and-forth tug between the five star general and the President is well-portrayed and I think is fair to both sides.<br /><br />I thought the acting was done very well and the chemistry of the cast does have its moments. But to really do the subject ustice I think this might have been better as two or three movies.three movies.
B0004Z33G4|4.0|I'm wrapping  my First Blood review up. I got to mention Brian Dennehy did a good job too you just want Rambo to kill him. The ending I liked how many bad a** action stars have had a breakdown scene. I think First Blood was the best of the series & you can get a copy for dirt cheap & it's very well worth watching.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|I wish I were there with all the audience and Jason Mraz at the Chicago concert! The performance is spectacular and the sound quality is superb. Please watch the DVD first because it is fun to see Jason having such a great time.
B000H5TVKI|4.0|I have been wanting to to review this movie for awhile First Blood starring Sylvester Stallone as a Vietnam veteran John Rambo Richard Crenna as Colonel Sam Trautman & Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Tessle. Ok we start off with Rambo is looking for 1 of his old Vietnam war buddies unfortunately he finds out he died of cancer from complications of Agent Orange well then Rambo goes into the small town of Hope Washington Rambo is going to get something to eat & but is harrassed by Sheriff Tessle. So when he is dropped off Rambo well he turns around Sheriff Tessle abuses his power & arrests Rambo at the police station he gets treated like s**t which bring back NAM flashbacks eventually he escapes & that's where the fun begins. I have this on Blu Ray it's actually a ok Blu Ray whit the different ending commentary was entertaining interviews were good. Stallone is great with the action & good acting wise & Richard Crenna I think had the strongest character as well as being the support in the 2 & 3.
B000FC1K66|3.0|The reader in my opinion was a very strange book about a boy's obsession with an older woman. I can see the irony in the woman later turning out to be a former SS officer, but I don't see why the author had to put so much sexually explicit material in a book about crimes committed in the past. Other then that I found the authors side quest to understand the holocaust to be quite worthy of note.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|I'll get the obvious out of the way immediately:  Were Star Trek (XI) a standalone piece of space-set science fiction entertainment, it would probably be one of the finest to come out off Hollywood in years.  The visuals are stunning, the acting top notch, the Michael Giacchino sound score flawless, and even JJ Abrams' direction (which is often criticized for being jumpy and dependent upon effects) is quite appropriate.  So why then a very mediocre review score?  The answer is simply this: Like George Lucas discovered when he went back to tell the first three episodes of his space opera epic, Star Wars, some material is so beloved and firmly established within the psyche of popular culture that it exists upon a pedestal no filmmaker can reach.<br /><br />Filmmakers hoping to re-establish, even with the hopes of improving upon, this type of property are simply flirting with disaster.  Enter Star Trek, a film that basically allows the viewer to experience the Star Trek Universe in its recreated infancy with all of the visual grandeur and evolved filmmaking technique of today's digital age without compromising the source material... too much.<br /><br />The film, directed by JJ Abrams, was written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is the eleventh film based on the Star Trek franchise and features the main characters of the original Star Trek television series, who are portrayed by an almost-entirely-new cast.<br /><br />The story's sense of grand scale is apparent right from the opening scene as the film begins something like this: The Federation starship USS Kelvin is sent to investigating a mysterious lightning storm in space, when a Romulan ship, the Narada, emerges from within the storm's vortex and quickly makes light work of the Federation vessel.<br /><br />The Romulans demand the captain Robau to transport to their ship to negotiate a ceasefire.  Once the Romulans realize, through their interrogation of Robau, that it's in fact the year is 2233 (meaning they had gone back in time) and that Robau naturally has no knowledge of the individual they feel is responsible for all their troubles, one ambassador Spock.<br /><br />Nero murders Robau in frustration and orders the Kelvin's destruction. Acting Captain George Samuel Kirk (James T's dad) orders the evacuation of the ship onto shuttlecrafts, including his pregnant wife, Wynona. He proceeds to sacrifice his own life to steer the Kelvin on a collision course into the Narada, resulting in only light damage to the massive Romulan mining vessel.<br /><br />From there the viewer is whisked along on what is basically a glorified succession of character introductions.  Settings span from the surface of the earth (Iowa in fact) to the deep reaches of the galaxy where the yet-unknowing crew of the starship Enterprise are scattered.<br /><br />For all of it's wonderfully brisk pacing, charming character introductions, and believable interactions, I can't seem to overcome the abundant and oft times blatant canon deviation that takes place within.  I will say this in the story's defense, we are to believe that this is NOT the Star Trek timeline we've grown to know and love throughout the years but rather a tangent, or parallel timeline that has been created by the Romulan interference of the space-time continuum.  Unlike say, Back to the Future, where a single time line is said to exist that can be moved around upon at will (affecting future events), Star Trek follows the hipper theory that the moment an alteration is made to the original timeline, two futures (or millions of them, depending on how many alterations are made) exist separately and independent of each other.<br /><br />Confused? Don't be, all it simply means is that while you're looking at young James T Kirk, Mister Spock, Captain Sulu, Scotty and so on, these aren't the same guys we grew up with.  They were the same initially but live in an entirely separate Universe, one in which the planet Vulcan is destroyed, where Captain Kirk never gets to meet his father, where Spock and Uhura have a passionate love affair, and where by the end of the film, there are two Spocks (one young, the other not so much) running around.  Will this trouble some longtime fans of the mythos? Absolutely.  Because while the novelty of witnessing the introduction of such legendary characters (however contrived) is present, there is an undeniable \\"cheapening\\" of the whole experience in knowing that this isn't the future we already know and love.<br /><br />In this line of thinking, anything's possible.  Let's say for the sake of argument that the yet confirmed sequel was to open with Kirk's death or the obliteration of the planet earth.  Not a problem, this isn't the timeline you grew up with anymore.  Alternate dimensions were never my thing even when comic books periodically decided to justify an important character's death by using the same technique.  It's hacky and a bit too convenient for me.<br /><br />I suppose my own frustration in the whole matter (either instance) is that it truly frees up the writers' ability to deviate from the series canon at will- and rest assured they use this power liberally in Star Trek.  Interviews and articles suggest that it was done as a means to reintroduce the Star Trek mythos to a whole new generation but the façade is quite transparent with motivation such as visual appeal and the writers' lack of knowledge on the original material's intricacies getting my vote.<br /><br />Again though, on its own, Star Trek is a delightful romp with stellar cinematography, breathtaking action sequences, and some outstanding actor performances (most notably a near-unrecognizable Eric Bana as the villain and New Zealander Karl Urban's subtle mastery of Bones McCoy's Kentucky accent).<br /><br />The dilemma the film was faced with was an understandably difficult one; while there is no denying that this material works best where it didn't have such big shoes to fill, the studio backing of Paramount, distribution, and box office appeal would have suffered immeasurably if not for the Star Trek branding.  As such, the question then becomes which is the more tolerable- A slight mockery of the established mythos within an action-heavy science fiction environment, or the film being canned before even getting off the ground due to its inability to nab major studio support?  Perhaps a compromise would best suit everyone but as it stands we get the former, take it or leave it.<br /><br />While unofficially labeled the eleventh major motion picture of the Star Trek franchise, you may notice that for the first time no zippy catch phrase can be found under the title card here.  This lends to the suspicion that the filmmakers are hoping this will be the foundation for a whole new \\"retooled\\" series using the names and likeness of the original crew of the Starship Enterprise, so long as the viewer realizes that in parallel universes, nothing's impossible.r gets to meet his father, where Spock and Uhura have a passionate love affair, and where by the end of the film, there are two Spocks (one young, the other not so much) running around.

I suppose my own frustration in the whole matter (either instance) is that it truly frees up the writers' ability to deviate from the series canon at will- and rest assured they use this power liberally in Star Trek.  Interviews and articles suggest that it was done as a means to reintroduce the Star Trek mythos to a whole new generation but the façade is quite transparent with motivation such as visual appeal and the writers' lack of knowledge on the original material's intricacies getting my vote.    Again though, on its own, Star Trek is a delightful romp with stellar cinematography, breathtaking action sequences, and some outstanding actor performances (most notably a near-unrecognizable Eric Bana as the villain and New Zealander Karl Urban's subtle mastery of Bones McCoy's Kentucky accent).    The dilemma the film was faced with was an understandably difficult one; while there is no denying that this material works best where it didn't have such big shoes to fill, the studio backing of Paramount, distribution, and box office appeal would have suffered immeasurably if not for the Star Trek branding.  As such, the question then becomes which is the more tolerable- A slight mockery of the established mythos within an action-heavy science fiction environment, or the film being canned before even getting off the ground due to its inability to nab major studio support?  Perhaps a compromise would best suit everyone but as it stands we get the former, take it or leave it.    While unofficially labeled the eleventh major motion picture of the Star Trek franchise, you may notice that for the first time no zippy catch phrase can be found under the title card here.  This lends to the suspicion that the filmmakers are hoping this will be the foundation for a whole new \\"retooled\\" series using the names and likeness of the original crew of the Starship Enterprise, so long as the viewer realizes that in parallel universes, nothing's impossible.
B001VPJYZK|4.0|I just started watching this show......... I find it entertaining and silly. Just the way some people act in life. Hollywood up a little bit, but I find it very realistic. I over hear women talk a lot and others tell me what them and there friends talk about.    I can't believe how weak some of the men are on this show. I've only seen season one and jumped to season 5, to see how the show progressed. I was shocked at the turn around of events. It seems that all these women are the same, just at different moments of there lives. They switched roles in there lives over time, like kid switch seats, playing musical guitars.   I also enjoy the acting......... there all just wonderful actors and actresses.     Now that I have watched half of the first and a hand full of episodes in the 5th season, I can see that the show has stayed steady. I hate watching shows that fall off and change by the middle of the second season and become a shell of themselves. I plan on buying each season at a time and watching them with my girlfriend.     It's not the same as sex in the city, which I used to watch in the first couple of seasons, but it's very similar. One thing that I like more about this than Sex in the City is the fact that the all live in the same neighborhood.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Reviews can be long, dreadful hyperboles that wax as deep as the reviewer's cleverness or cuteness, all depending upon that critic's individual motivation. But speaking simply as a lover of music, I am really constrained to a few words. Susan Boyle's debut album, \\"I Dreamed a Dream' is filled with honesty, beauty and the kind of pleasure normally created by a calm and private evening dreaming into the flames of a quiet fire on a cold winter night. There is warmth, an inner familairity, sometimes a sorrowful loneliness, to Boyle's eclectic selection of rhapsody and mood. I pray that going forward Susan Boyle is spared from the often heartless and merciless side of the music business. I gave it an A+
1891252089|5.0|The thing  I like most about this book is the photos of primary and especially second series as it allows me to practice second series sequence on my own at home.  I love the descriptions of the asanas and their alternate options and the photos of the whole series in the back.  Very comprehensive book not for beginners.  Perfect for the person w/a good solid primary series.  I liked it so much that I showed it to two friends and they ordered it and are also using it at home.
B000LJAEFG|5.0|From the earliest sci-fi movies to the latest graphic novel people have been speculating on transferring thoughts and experiences. You may recall, &quot;Total Recall&quot; or a recent independent &quot;Sleep Dealer&quot; where with minimum connections you are lost and possibly endangered by others' thoughts dead or alive.<br /><br />This is a good presentation of the standard who done it mystery mixes with a tad of sci-fi. The characters and story make the film.<br /><br />Researchers Lillian Reynolds (Louise Fletcher) and Michael Brace (Christopher Walken) build a though recorder. Now everyone, government, perverts, lost loves, industrialists etc., wants the device for different purposes. Soon someone is dead. Soon someone is dead. Guess how they search for who done it and why.
B00003XAVA|5.0|I also own the LP which I bought when it first came out. This is a wonderful album with great harmonies and lyrics! Especially haunting is the final song: \\"To The Last Whale: Critical Mass/ Wind On The Water\\".
B0028RXXE8|5.0|The bad news is that there is a lot of gratuitous sex and nudity. It was a bit difficult getting around that at first, but once I was able to do that and get into the story, I was hooked. The writers really created an intricate story that showed the life of Rome from the Imperial perspective to the view of the most lowly slaves. The story moves along with realism, excitement, and breath taking beauty. If you choose to watch the subtitled version, you get insight into why the characters are doing what they are doing. This adds another dimension to what you are watching that keeps it so much more interesting. If you are like me and can't get enough, you can watch it again with the director's commentary and get yet ANOTHER perspective on the acting, filming, motivation, etc. I've watched the whole series about 3 times now and followed that up with a trip to Rome, so I am obviously a big fan. Loved it and highly recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best tv shows made.  This one has it all...humor, action, angst.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I ordered this even though I have seen all the shows, but they are so funny and witty you cant go wrong with this on a \\"rainy day.\\"  I love the show each Monday night, and I sure have loved having this DVD!  They are great fun!  I plan to order the second set when I get money sometime after the holidays.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I loved every second of this movie.  I could I have possibly missed it the first time around?
B002T45VX6|2.0|I still remember the exact moment when I heard Estoy aqui for the very first time: I was in my bedroom, studying for midterms and as the chorus ended I thought \\"wow, that's a voice\\". Only after I saw the video did I realize she was roughly my age and full of potential. Shakira's career took off with such impulse that a single trip around the earth would not be enough to make her fuel run out.    Fourteen years later and five albums under the arm the story seems to be the same. Or almost, at least. She Wolf finds her at a point in her life where everything has fallen finally into place, but maybe this has not quite sparked the flame to create an outstanding record. To put it simply, not even her last song in English (that sexy duet with Beyonce) could have prompted me to think twice whether to continue listening or turn off the stereo.     There are many factors that contribute to make Shewolf an utter disappointment for any true fan. First, she cannot convey in English what she transmits when she sings in Spanish. That has been a fact with very few exceptions (Hips don't lie and Underneath your clothes) that no matter how much we try to defend, has no escaping. Her voice finds a wall every time she delivers her verses in a foreign language and, in this case, the added synthesizers and dance beats help no further.   Second, she has allowed individual producers to slaughter her unique style hoping to obtain a more universal appeal. Unfortunately, that gamble results in a lifeless performance that any Britney could replicate.  Third, Shakira has never needed to prove herself to anyone, but in She Wolf she sounds as if every note was written to do so. Otherwise it cannot be understood why her identity is lost at the hands of merciless producers that make her tracks disappear amidst cliches and unexplainable arrangements, or why she seems to navigate aimlessly in creatively chopped paths.    Not everything deserves the waste basket here. Ironically, the six bonus tracksincluded in the U.S. release of the album (not in the original pressing released in the rest of America) contradict and improve everything that she has offered in the first ten tracks. Thus, Lo hecho esta hecho and Anos Luz, the Spanish versions of Did it again and Long time soar when she imbues them with her soulful native tongue, and acquire a new dimension when she words the meaning of her delectable prose.    I am positive that in a matter of months she will surprise us with a fantastic record in Spanish. She has to. The point of her music was never to gain millions of fans, but to touch them and embrace them, to make them one in all, and with this erratic attempt she has obviously lost that vision. The talent remains, but the form has betrayed her and us, hopefully momentarily.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|I enjoyed this album,some of the songs are really cool, like   Love story  Hey Stephen  Breathe  Fearless  Change    But many sound a lot like someones dirty laundry and botched relationships and VERY repetitive  White Horse, You're not sorry, Forever and Always, The way I loved you, Tell me Why    All those songs have the exact same theme...\\"I once loved you and now I'm sad/angry with you\\"  I don't know about you, but I really don't like to listen to someones anger at an ex boyfriend and sadness over a messed up relationship  Don't get me wrong, I love Taylor swift, but I think this album has way too many break up songs. One or two per album is enough.
0316044695|5.0|I bought this book because I like reading about our military and what they do.  I also have a nephew who has been a Seal for 14 years.  This was a very real story about some very brave Americans. I could not put this book down.  The book took you step by step through Seal team training and right through this young man's incredible story of courage, bravery and survival of a brutal attack of which he was the only survivor.  At times it was difficult to read how these young men suffered and died but yet the story had to be told so people would know these young men. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a story about true bravery and courage.
0066620996|5.0|Got this book for a Business Strategy class, but read it in a few days.  It was a very interesting book and had a lot of insight into what companies need to make the transition from Good to Great.  It is very interesting considering the current state of some of the companies selected in the book that did well.
B000MR9D5E|1.0|This product although advertised as coming in its original plastic wrapping was defective and skipped and was not viewable.
1569242739|5.0|I haven't gone through the entire book of recipes, but I tried the basic chocolate and the pumpkin chocolate chip cupcakes. They are so awesome, it's unbelievable. The frosting is so good too ... mmm. I've had vegans, vegetarians, and non-vegetarians eat them, and they've all unanimously said that they were moist, delicious, and you couldn't even tell there were no dairy products used. Even my grandfather, who says like ten words a day, commented on them, which is a big deal.    I thought the pumpkin ones were going to be a one time thing for Thanksgiving, but wow, they turned out so well that I can't wait to make them again. And I can't reiterate how delicious the basic vanilla buttercream frosting is.    Since I've been vegan for a couple of years, and hadn't had a real cupcake for a while before that, I thought maybe I thought they were really good, but no one else would. Like I said above, everyone who has tried them has loved them.    For the frosting, others said not to use the soy milk. I don't use the soy milk solely because other reviewers have said not to, and it turns out great. Maybe it's better with the soy milk, maybe it's worse ... for now, I'm sticking to leaving it out ;)    Also, another tip: if you have fresh vanilla beans, scrape the pod and add the flecks to the batter and the frosting. I think it tastes great and it's aesthetically pleasing as well when you see the dark flecks in the white frosting.    Highly recommended!
B002TVQ4GW|2.0|This movie tries to do the same thing that Timecrimes did, by showing what would happen if you got stuck in a time paradox but it doesn't do it as well. If you want to see it done right, see Timecrimes instead. That's a five star film.
B000002H6C|5.0|Although the band had much success with their previous 3 albums, \\"Justice\\" would be the on that put them on the radio and MTV with the unlikely hit \\"One\\".  The song was a 7 minute plus tour de force based on the novel \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\".  An unlikely hit for sure, but a song that was all over MTV and rock radio in 1988.  Along with the previous album \\"Master Of Puppets\\", this would be the band's most progressive metal oriented recording.  All of the songs clock in above the 5 minute mark with lengthy instrumental passages and epic lyrics and song structure.  \\"Justice\\" also marked the first recording after the tragic death of original bassist Cliff Burton.  The rage and sorrow at his loss is evident throughout this album.  On the downside new bassist Jason Newstead is constantly buried in the mix on this one to the point where his contributions are almost non-existent.  The drum sound on this album is also rather \\"light\\" even though Lars performance is fantastic.  I think this album could really use a good remastering and it would come across much better.  The material on this one is all top notch Metallica.  For me there is not a weak track in the bunch and shows the band at the absolute top of their game.  If this is not Metallica's best album it surly resides in the top 3 of their career.  Yea it's sometimes overblown and pretentious, but to a progressive rock fan like me this is all icing on the cake.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|I can't explain some of the other reviews that are one or two or three stars.  I saw Pearl Jam in concert in Philly recently.  I've been listening to Backspacer constantly.  I love it.  All of it.  Every song.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Great songs, sexy beautiful voice.n  Seller fast shipping and product as advertised!  Thanks
B002LW9ITY|5.0|A previous reviewer has said enough about the movie itself (it's a great movie) and the special features.  I want to talk about picture quality.  Anyone with a Blu-ray player and an HDTV, knows how good movies look in high definition.  I've owned a Blu-ray player ([[ASIN:B002I0J4VQ PlayStation 3 120 GB]]) and and HDTV ([[ASIN:B001U3Y8QI Samsung LN46B630 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color]]) for several years now and I have dozens of Blu-ray movies.  Cars is simply stunning in Blu-ray, hands down it is one of the best movies to watch on Blu-ray.  The picture quality is seriously jaw dropping.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|This classic movie is one of my daugher's favorites.  She has watched it so much that we have had to replace the   disc once so far, and she is only 2 1/2!!!!  I can't really stand this movie personally because she has watched it so many times, but since we have a portable DVD player, she can watch it anytime she likes.  I realize many parents may think that I am neglecting her by allowing her to watch this movie, or any other, so often they need to replace the disc, but since her father is deployed to Iraq for this holiday season, I feel anything that can keep her in good spirits and happy is fine..:D:D
B002I6251G|4.0|It is interesting that rock bands are going electronic right now (e.g. Blaqk Audio/AFI), but this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Right now... holy crap--Papillon makes me think that it is 1982 again.  And I loved 1982!  I bought this CD because I was such a huge fan of the Editors past efforts.  This, unfortunately, is not quite up to par--but is still better than 99% of the other crap out there right now.  I am not sure that the world needs another EMB band and, given that the Editors were the best (IMHO) at what they had been doing, I hope they return to past form in their next effort.  But, that said, this is not a bad disk to add to your collection.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I think that most of the reviews have already covered what Wall-E is. A marvelous picture. Not a simple cartoon but a sensitive movie with countless messages to everyone who sees it.    But I am here because of the 3 Disc Blu-Ray Edition. I would like to know \\"where is the documentary THE PIXAR STORY\\"? I was told it is on Disc 1, but I don't seem to find it there. I've searched all 3 discs and nothing.    Can anyone tell me please? 'Cause I love this documentary and I would like to see it.    I would like to thank PIXAR for the incredible movies the make year after year.      To Infinity & Beyond!!!!
1843106698|5.0|Easy and informative read. Great for Clinicians, Teachers, Parents and actual Aspies who want to know more. Great suggestions for all with many resources listed in the back.
B001GQSY5U|2.0|What a let down. After watching and totally enjoying the first Clone Wars cartoons, I was sadly disappointed when this was released. All of the characters appear carved from stone with their total lack of facial expression, and it is very distracting. If they had told the same story as a real cartoon, and not this cg garbage, it would have made a HUGE difference. Do your self a favor and skip these video game cut scenes and go find the real Star Wars Clone Wars cartoons, still available used on Amazon.
B002BBRZWW|5.0|My 8 year old son hated to read, no matter how much we worked with him he just wasn't interested. These Whimpy kid books has been the miracle we've been looking for. My son loves reading them and has such a strong interest.  He reads so fast now so that he can get the next one of the series. He's on book #2 and almost finished and it's only been 3 weeks since I bought them.  He'll have them all read before Christmas (which was suppose to be his Christmas presents, but we've had to give them to him early) and he loves reading at night in his room with his flash light. My son is very excited that #4 just came out that he rushed home to tell us. He doesn't know that we already have it waiting for him.  I hope the author writes more of these fantastic books for children!

0471267554|3.0|Concept excellent....Restrictive if followed exactly but modified to your lifestyle following the basics is very doable.
0312360266|1.0|A friend of mine that owns very many fantasy books recommended and lended me this book.  I wanted to like it because she did, but I was disappointed.<br /><br />These two sisters that write these books have no buisness writing novels.  The way Zoe reacts to situations, the way other characters act in this book, don't make any sense and aren't realistic.  Zoe has the coolest boyfriend, Heath, and yet she describes herself as an outcast.  She is moody with her 'perfect' mother, but loves her grandmother.<br /><br />When her grandmother finds out her granddaughter is a vampyre, she has the most disappointing reaction in the book.  She warmly accepts her granddaughter's change, doesn't question it, and doesn't even extend pity to Zoe, after all, most fledglings die.<br /><br />If that's true, why doesn't the government ban Trackers from schools so that no innocent teenagers will die?<br /><br />Aphrodite was the classic blonde, evil domineering cheerleader, except there's no cheerleaders at this school.  Her character was very disappointing, but nothing got past the disappointment of Zoe's depthless character.<br /><br />Besides Zoe's lack of personality she displays throughout the book after being the school reject at her human high school, my disappointment in the attack on Protestants was great.  Nyx, the goddess of the vampyres, is shown to be real and very powerful, while 'goody-two-shoes', church-going, controlling, psychopaths that control most of the human race are painted in the worst light.  This attack on Christians is annoying.  Can't they find some other way to fill the pages of their book then attacking religion that isn't pagan?<br /><br />I also agree with another reviewer, the 'teenage language' that is used it laughable.  I thought it was some sort of a joke at first, characters saying 'poopie', but apparently not, as it was repeated.<br /><br />All said and done, I won't be reading any more of these.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|Norah Jones has enlisted some top new collaborators to create a CD with a darker rootsier more 'rock' feel.  While I wouldn't call this as radical a departure as some have claimed, you can definitely hear a faster tempo and depth in the lyrics, but fans of Norah's slow groove will still find works they are going to enjoy as well (You've Ruined Me, Back to Manhattan, for example).    The opener, \\"Chasing Pirates\\" definitely shows the rock sentiment.  It's a well-chosen radio piece that will get attention for the entire effort. This song, \\"Young Blood\\", \\"I wouldn't need you\\" and \\"Tell your Mama\\" are my favorites of the Baker's dozen offered up here.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2009
B002W6Z0UK|1.0|This is another GREAT work by Gaga. \\"Dance In the Dark\\" is fantastic and has some cool sampling which sounds like \\"Strangelove\\" from Depeche Mode. It's a great dance song, great mixing. The rest of the songs are still growing on me, albeit quickly.     The only reason for the 1-star review is Amazon selling censored music without indicating it as such. If the reviews all show 4-5 stars at the top, everyone will just buy it w/o thinking twice. Definitely buy this album, just know that if you buy it here and now you're getting censored music so look for it somewhere else to get the full version if it is available elsewhere. Note this was the MP3 version, not the physical album.
B00000IQCA|3.0|When Robert Altman decides to parody, he doesn't do anything half way.  Considering that the fashion industry is all about labels, the all-star cast is very appropriate, including:  Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bacall, Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Linda Hunt, and Lyle Lovett.      The story's parallel to the confusion prevalent in huge expositions, such as fashion shows, etc.  We have murder, nudity, sex, and gossip--all the tender morsels the news feeds on.  If you're a fashionista or someone who loves poking fun at the world of design, you're probably going to love this film.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2009
B002GMNLLA|5.0|A couple of months ago, I bought this album's predecessor, Above The Weeping World, based on a recommendation from a fellow fan of Dark Tranquillity.  I consider ATWW a pretty good CD, but it never grew on me the way I hoped it would.  Still holding out hope for Insomnium, I reluctantly bought Across The Dark, and I'm so glad I did because this album improves upon ATWW in every possible way:    -- The songs are more atmospheric  -- The riffs, while not earthshaking, are more interesting  -- The clean vocals, which are used somewhat sparingly, eliminate the monotony of 100% growled/roared vocals.    -- The production is cleaner, but the album is in no way over-produced    I just cannot emphasize enough how pleasantly surprised I was by Across The Dark.  I didn't expect anything to beat out Amorphis' Skyforger as my favorite album of 2009, but I think Across The Dark may have done it.  If you like Amorphis, Dark Tranquillity, or Opeth, then you need to hear this.
B0026J8LHM|4.0|Member for member, there is not a more talented rock ensemble on the planet-period. This band doesn't have a weakness or bottleneck, and can play many styles of music with exceptional competence.  What an amazing feeling that must be as a musician to have no limits creatively and musically. What is more impressive is that their musical prowess seems to become more interesting and complex with each addition to their catalog.    The problem I have is that, with the last couple of releases, I haven't been able to connect on an emotional/artistic level with what they have been doing. It just seems they are more about a technical demonstration of ability, and the music has become more sterile and clinical as a result. When the new compositions reach for an emotional reaction from the listener, it seems that they miss or, as some have mentioned, tend to be over-the-top and cliche. As people have noted, the lyrics on this cd seem uninspired and this may be part of the problem. However, for me, the music itself lacks inspiration as well this time out. It seems the compositions are simply a structure or background to bounce solos and intricate rhythms off of.    Despite this, I will continue to line up and be one of the first to scoop up the next cd release and the one after that. It's worth the price to hear these great musicians play together . I love this band and can only take one star off despite my criticisms. Maybe all they need is a break from the constant grind before the next studio endeavor.
0131177052|2.0|I work at a decent sized telecommunications company.  We have legacy code written in C that is over 1 million lines of code.  Some of the code was written as far back as 1988. Needless to say, we didn't follow TDD and there are not a lot of unit tests. We have recently increase the number developers to add features to this code base and I was hoping that this book would help.<br /><br />We've been doing a \\"techincal book club\\" for a while as part of continuous training.  I've had about 20 engineers reading this book a few chapters a week and discussing them.  Most of the reviews from the group have been negative.  Hard to read, annoying editorial errors (duplicate text on following pages), and not really getting a lot out of it.  The main problem is that our system is not using an object oriented language so a lot (most) of the techniques are not relevant.<br /><br />At first I thought it was just me, but as I asked the other engineers, there was a lot of concensus, even from engineers that have worked on Java/C++ projects in the past.<br /><br />I picked this book because of the following taglines on the back of the book:<br /><br />* Techniques that can be used with any language or platform-with examples in Java, C++, C, and C#<br />* Coping with legacy systems that aren't object-oriented<br /><br />There is one small section on non-object oriented code.  It basically says that you should slowly migrate to an object oriented language.<br /><br />Anyway - we've stopped reading the book.  If you're code is already object oriented, this is probably a great book. If it's not, I wouldn't bother.  Instead pick up a differnt book on how to migrate the code to an object oriented language.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Great CD. Received it in great condition with cute wrapping and a sweet note from the seller. Overall, a great purchasing experience!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I ordered this 3 days ago and just got it a few hours ago as a birthday present to myself. I made the right choice. What a beautiful person with such a beautiful voice. I've been listening to the CD and know anyone who orders one will love it as much as I do.
1600240003|3.0|I've read and reviewed almost all of the Harry Bosch books and they've all been enthusiastic 5 star reviews. Connelly falls out of the stratosphere with this one. Note, he doesn't crash and burn but this is simply not as good as the rest.<br /><br />To begin with, the plot is fairly simple and straightforward compared to the usual brooding, complex story lines. I heard this as an audiobook and it was just flubbed my veteran narrator Len Cariou. All of the male characters sounded like an impersonation of character actor Brian Doyle-Murray. It was not a pretty scene.<br /><br />So, I can now confirm that Connelly is now a mortal among writers - he has written a merely pedestrian, run-of-the-mill police procedural.
B000FZDGTM|5.0|Back in '85, it all came together in a big way for The Cure when Robert Smith assembled a supremely talented band that quickly began to fulfill its full potential as a first-rate alternative pop group with THE HEAD ON THE DOOR. This was a huge album for me personally as it was the first truly alternative rock music I became totally absorbed with. It was such a revelation to find this intriguing world of possibilities beyond the standard classic rock radio fare. Only 14, I listened to this album all through this pivotal year and began earnestly exploring their back catalog. This album encompasses the various strengths of all their previous efforts, from super-catchy pop to morbid melancholy. My song by song review of the original album can be found under other HEAD ON THE DOOR releases or my reviews page. The following is a review of each track on the bonus disk. As usual, this Deluxe Edition Cure package is first-rate with rare photos and excellent liner notes.<br /><br />Bonus tracks (disk 2):<br /><br />As one might expect, the majority of these bonus tracks will mostly appeal to obsessive Cure fans. Generic keyboard sounds were employed on these demos before the final textures were chosen and they're loaded with cheesy 80's drum machine \\"claps.\\"<br /><br />\\"In Between Days\\" (Robert Smith home demo) (1:25) - Robert Smith alone on electric guitar and keys, playing the basic melody along to a drum box beat. Serves as a pleasant little reminder of the final version. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Inwood\\" (R.S. home demo) (2:18) - a rather slight song sketch, this unreleased track still could've turned into something good. Smith overdubs rhythm and lead guitars, employing a slight Middle-Eastern sound reminiscent of \\"The Wailing Wall.\\" Cool drum machine. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Push\\" (R.S. home demo) (2:31) - a breezy little song sketch with guitar, bass and drum box. ***1/4<br /><br />\\"Innsbruck\\" (R.S. home demo) (2:37) - vaguely ominous unreleased cut with a cool guitar that builds intensity. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Stop Dead\\" (studio demo) (3:21) - featuring the full band, this cool song is inferior to the final version but not far off. The bass part isn't fully developed but still sounds great. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Mansolidgone\\" (s.d.) (4:06) - This unreleased track sports a light-hearted cabaret swing with jazzy keys and Robert Smith scat singing. Fun! ****<br /><br />\\"Screw\\" (s.d.) (3:09) - has that great bass line with a different tone - lighter yet more metallic - and some keyboards not used in the final version. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Lime Time\\" (s.d.) (2:56) - happy, airy with lyrics that were later used on \\"In Between Days,\\" Six Different Ways,\\" and \\"New Day.\\" Slight, a bit too repetitive and overly happy for my tastes. **1/4<br /><br />\\"Kyoto Song\\" (s.d.) (4:28) - eerie background keys, slightly unhinged Robert Smith vocals with an improvised feel. Smith is an excellent vocal stylist and the way he just wings it on several of these demos, trying to figure out the part is so cool. ****<br /><br />\\"A few hours after this . . .\\" (s.d.) (4:36) - this version features the full band in place of the gorgeous orchestral keys on the final master giving the song a quite different feel. The track originally released as a B-side is one of my favorites. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Six Different Ways\\" (s.d.) (3:00) - close to the final version of this quirky, playful track, yet this take is intriguingly unique at the same time. ****<br /><br />\\"A Man Inside My Mouth\\" (s.d.) (3:00) - one of the most fantastic and bizarre Cure songs ever, this version, like most of the demos here, is less powerful than the final master. Features a drum machine and different lyrics. ***<br /><br />\\"A Night Like this\\" (s.d.) (4:08) - close to the final version with some slightly different lyrics. Porl Thompson's sax solo is quite different here, reminiscent of his playing during the Top era. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"The Exploding Boy\\"(s.d.) (3:06) - another great B-side, this version is very good. ****<br /><br />\\"Close To Me\\" (s.d.) (4:03) - hasn't yet achieved the jittery, quiet yet playful intensity of the final version but it's quite listenable. Great Smith vocals! ****1/2<br /><br />\\"The Baby Screams\\" (live bootleg) - good version, decent sound. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"The Blood\\" (live bootleg) - Robert Smith always seems to screw up the lyrics when he sings this one live. The crowd singing along is quite audible on these boots, especially this one. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Sinking\\" (live bootleg) - great version, this song is a harbinger of their even more masterful forays into depression rock later heard on DISINTEGRATION. ****1/2inal version but it's quite listenable. Great Smith vocals! ****1/2     \\"The Baby Screams\\" (live bootleg) - good version, decent sound. ***1/2     \\"The Blood\\" (live bootleg) - Robert Smith always seems to screw up the lyrics when he sings this one live. The crowd singing along is quite audible on these boots, especially this one. ***1/2     \\"Sinking\\" (live bootleg) - great version, this song is a harbinger of their even more masterful forays into depression rock later heard on DISINTEGRATION. ****1/2
0425166805|5.0|I read this already a couple of years ago in the german version. Now I am buying it to give it to persons who are open minded.<br />It is definitly not for closed minded persons.<br />It makes you think.<br />Nobody has to believe it - this is every ones personal decision.<br />But it is a great book to look at a lot of interesting questions from an other angle of view.<br />... and the closed minded persons can train their tolerance on it ;)
0440242576|5.0|I'll admit right off I am not much of a John Grisham fan, but I thought this book was laugh-out-loud funny. The whole time I was reading it, I thought that it would make a great movie. Unfortunately, they ruined that. Oh well... I highly recommend this book to anyone who believes that Christmas is more than just decorations; that it is primarily about family and friends.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I was wondering if I was the only one who was slightly underwhelmed by this album.  All the songs kinda sound the same.  And Susan needs BIG songs! That voice is totally wasted on little ballads and soft-steppers like \\"End of the World\\" and the sappy \\"Daydream Believer.\\" The show tunes work best, I think, and the spiritual music is OK but should of been placed on a separate album. The pop songs are garbage and should be placed in the garbage. Too bad for us and too bad for Susan. I will download the songs I like and skip the rest. \\" I Dreamed a Dream\\" is fantastic and worth the price of the album if you avoid the obvious mistakes.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|You may have sen the cover of this book while browsing in a bookstore or shopping on Amazon. The cover may not have pulled you but from where I come from, Dubai UAE, the cover is of a pale, pale girl, with hollow eyes and a haunting expression.

B001FB55HQ|5.0|This movie never really never got the credit it deserved at the box office.  This is a really good action flick.  My husband said it was the best movie he'd seen in a long time (and we watch a lot of movies).  It's got non-stop edge-of-your-seat action, and I thought Christian Bale was GREAT as John Connor.  Newcomer Sam Worthington was good in this, too.  If you read the reviews, you'll see what's driving the number of stars down is the fact that people don't like it that there are extras on the blu-ray version, but not the regular dvd version.  This movie gets five stars from me.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I was lucky to get this on the lightning deal Amazon had for $99.99. I like the set , it sounds great. The only gripe I have is that the discs come in cases that you slide the discs in and out of but they don't have sleeves to protect the discs from being scratched when slid them in or out. I saw pictures someone posted of the mono set and it looks like they have plastic covers. Doesn't make sense why they would do it with one but not the other. I made my own by folding a piece of paper and cutting it to size.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is coming from one who has not purchased a music CD for myself in about 10 years but yet I could not wait for this one to come out. I pre-ordered one for myself and for my sister as a birthday present. The song choices were perfect!!! And sound even better each time it is played. These were specific songs that were chosen with special meaning for Susan and now they have special meaning for the many thousands who LOVE this CD. I can't wait for her next one!!!!!
B002MW50KO|1.0|After a couple of seconds, you ask, \\"This is a joke, right?\\" The way Nigel Tufnel asks when David's girlfriend suggests that Spinal Tap dress as zodiac animals.  That's what I asked when I heard the most awful version of  \\"Here Comes Santa Claus.\\"  But I think Dylan is serious.  Those of you that have the cd, please tell me it ain't so.

B002AF4Y96|3.0|This comment is about the new Director's Cut on BLU-ray. This could have been the PERFECT release of Natural Born Killers. It is one of my favorite films. I returned this Blu-ray once thinking it was defective only to received another exactly the same. Someone messed up this transfer. If you look at the edged, there is a \\"shake\\" on the film from beginning to the end. It is not always as noticeable, but in some scenes it's distracting. The films \\"shakes\\" or moves up and down. It seems like that's the way it was transfered. I checked out my ancient DVD of the same Director's Cut and the movement is not there. Oh well. I guess if I was going to watch one version of this film this would be it because of the great sound and sharpness. If it didn't wiggle like it does, I would have been %100 happy. I guess I'll wait until they \\"restore\\" it again. :(
0778321606|1.0|The characters in this book have the emotional maturity of ten year olds.  The book is sappy, preachy, repetitive, unrealistic and just plain annoying.        If 300 plus pages of whining sounds like fun to you, this is the book for you.      What a waste of time!
0385504225|4.0|While this book wasn't anything epic, it was still a fun book to read. This book is the third best out of the three Langdon books, but considering I really liked the first two, it's not saying much that it wasn't as good. There was nothing in this book that blew my mind like the previous two, but overall, I wasn't disappointed when I finished the book.
0385504225|1.0|Good book until the last 50 pages!  Seriously, the worst ending to a book in the history of books, which in turn made the whole book a waste of my time. I would definitely not pay the money to buy this book.  Get it from your local library because in a couple months it will definitely be in stock because it is such a bad book!
B001FB55HQ|1.0|I'm really disappointed that Warner Bros has decided to only release the Director's cut in the US on Blu-Ray.  Like many others, I agree that Blu-Ray should not be forced down consumer's throats.  Warner Bros will lose $ales over this decision. It's very short-sighted.  I will not be buying this DVD version and I will not buy the Blu-Ray version either.  Hope someone at Warner Bros gets the message.
B0026P3G12|1.0|I am writing this review for my mother, who had pre-ordered the album.  When I asked her how it was, she said it was just awful, that she had wished she never put money down on such a bad album.
B001GM28HO|5.0|The beat is awesome. Most Cds may only have one or two good songs in them. This one has about six or seven. I definitely got my money's worth. What prompted me to buy the CD was the loss of my downloaded music. So I got to thinking that if I have the physical media (CD) it does not matter if my computer crashes. I will still have the music. I did all the right things to safeguard my music. I had two good backups. I found most of the lost music. But my Lady Gaga album was gone. So I learned a valuable lesson. From now on I will buy CDs.
1569242739|5.0|This is one of the most-used cookbooks I own, and it the results never fail to impress. I am not a vegan, but these recipes are as good as any non-vegan baking. Many people have a prejudice against vegan food, but if you didn't tell them, they'd never know these rich, moist cupcakes didn't contain butter. Also great for the lactose-intolerant. Great pictures, easy-to-follow directions, fun ideas. You will not regret buying this book.
B0024FAG6M|4.0|It is great to have the classic Easy Rider now on Blu-Ray. The enhanced picture and sound quality really makes this movie a collector's choice if you are from that era. 40 years ago, I saw the Easy Rider movie in a Drive-In Theater on my Triumph motorcycle ! What a great memory! Now I watch it on our 106\\" Home Theater, and my Harley is parked in the garage!
0395754100|5.0|Wonderful, classic children's literature.  Book in excellent condition.  Excellent customer service and fast shipping.
031606792X|4.0|Ok, I am not one to spoil a book so I do not give details of the story.. But I think I may be crazy, but this was my favorite book of the series in some ways.  But first I need to say that we went from book one innocent teenage romance to book four, sex, pregnancy, blood, and descriptive \\"hunting\\" how to's.  I can not wrap my mind around how many pages in all I have read and the first three books have sort of blurred together, but wow, what happened to the fourth???     I say this was my favorite because I finally understood one of the charctes reasons for even being there.  My nerves had just about had it with the character...  And we finally get to see one very important character do something besides complain and whine and drool...     But.....  I stress this how can we say read this 12 yearold....  This 1st book ok, 2nd still alright..  the 3rd getting a little weird.. 4th wamm.. here you go totally unexpected...  This was more written for someone my age on the high side of 20..      I have read all four books, and I do miss the characters in some ways.  You know how it is after you have read so much about them.  But then again I am glad that after close to 2500 pages I am finished..  I made it..  :) Good luck..
0810982862|5.0|I received The Art of Avatar yesterday and it was one of the most amazing looks into the brilliance of technology and James Cameron's vision I've ever seen!<br />I am a screenwriting student and film student and I was amazed at every page, every idea that is needed to put an idea for a motion picture to life. And it is mindboggling.<br />Cameron had to wait for the technology to catch up to his ideas, and that took almost a decade.<br />Peter Jackson's preface uses the phrase 'Suspension of Disbelief' as the world between the filmmaker and the audience. You as a member of the audience are watching a film in its real time. The world you are in is the world you see onscreen.<br />And to do that properly is the magic of film.<br />The Art of Avatar shows the people, the animals, the humans, the natives of the moon Pandora, in magnificent detail is worth purchasing the book. The process of the evolution of how a character or beast is created in amazing.<br />I cannot wait to see this film and given the taste of its beauty and plotting, am amazed this technology exists to give this to us.<br />The only negative I can give and it is nothing really, but the middle page of my book was not connected, and I don't think that was on purpose. There are fold-out pages that blow your mind in the book, but the middle photo encompased just the 2 middle pages.<br />If that is the worst criticism I can give to a book, fuggetaboutit! I did and carefully fitted the page back.<br />The Art of Avatar is a wonderful art showing unto itself, but if you are at all interested in seeing the movie, or are a film maker, you will appreciate this gorgeous book.
B002UXRH10|5.0|This CD is great! Every Track on this CD is the bomb! Rihanna should have added an old Pat Benatar track Love is a Battlefield to this CD.
B002UXRH10|2.0|Rihanna embraces the darkness to return with an explicitly edgier album that recounts her botched relationship with Chris Brown. There is a lot of hurt and defiance channelled through from her personal altercations that fed her feeling of righteous anger. Her vocal prowess has certainly improved, which a clear sign of maturity and coming to grips with that anger. However, the songs have no substance and the reliance of repetitive theme makes it a sub-calibre feat. Rated R has set a new standard for a cathartic reflection of a vulnerable female. Highlights include \\"Te Amo\\" and \\"Fire Bomb\\".
B00076RT24|3.0|George Lucas' STAR WARS prequels have received a lot of flack (some from me!) for being too much focused on CGI and not enough on dialogue and strong characters. And based on the overall quality of the prequels, the complaints are warranted! But, that said, I think that this one, THE PHANTOM MENACE, is the best of the prequels. Unlike its successors ATTACK OF THE CLONES and REVENGE OF THE SITH, this first of the new trilogy is not nearly as bogged down in political details and sappy romance and doesn't come to a screeching halt at times like the other two. THE PHANTOM MENACE is kind of a new introduction to the STAR WARS universe, as it is, technically, EPISODE I. So timeline wise, it all begins here.     MENACE benefits from having a lot of energy and being fast-paced. It compels the viewer to accept this world and doesn't waste time as much as the successor films of the trilogy. The film's protagonists are Qui-Gon Jin (truly fine performance by Liam Neeson) and his young apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (solid Ewan McGregor). Additionally, the solid cast includes Jake Lloyd (as young Anakin Skywalker), Natalie Portman (as teen Queen Amidala of Naboo), Samuel L. Jackson (as Jedi Master Mace Windu), Ian McDarmid (as Senator Palpatine, Naboo's representative in the Senate), Terence Stamp (as Chancellor Valorem, appointed leader of the Republic), Pernilla August (as Anakin's mother Schmi Skywalker) and Ray Park (as Darth Maul, apprentice to behind-the-scenes Darth Sidious). Also, we get to see \\"young\\" Yoda! In this film, as in the originals, Yoda is a puppet, whereas in the other prequels, he is CGI. If the actors seem a tad monontonous at times,  I blame this mostly on the weak script and George Lucas' direction, or lack thereof. Lucas focused more on effects and plot here than he did in his actor's performances, so I'm not going to blame them for having the misfortune of working from shortsighted direction and script. Mostly everything else works.    In addition to Yoda, there are some good 'creature' characters like Anakin and Schmi's slavemaser Watto, Anakin's rival young Greedo (from the original STAR WARS) and Sebulba (a pod-racing star). Also, legendary robots C3PO and R2D2 return for the proceedings (good thing robots can live forever!).     The biggest draws to this film are several exciting and well done action scenes, including the fantastic CGI pod race in the middle of the film and the climactic lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan and Darth Maul. Also, the musical score that accompanies this film is really top notch and accentuates the action sequences. Not even close to the magic of the films of the original trilogy, but a much better movie-watching experience than the 2 flicks that followed!    This 2-disc set is great with a commentary and extra disc that explains how a lot of the CGI was handled and of course deleted scenes.
B001OY5X2Q|5.0|If you own any of the previous releases of this album, it sounds pretty much the same, except a little clearer, and a bit louder.  I bought this one to complete my SATB library of remasters.  The first bonus-track is just a remix.  The other 2 bonus-tracks sound fairly similar to the single versions, and are kind of interesting and not too bad.  However, the real jewel for all SATB fans is the final bonus track on this album, \\"Starcrossed Lovers\\".  It's a great example of the band in their prime, and Siouxsie's voice sounds amazing on this one, as she's not singing in her usual style.  I recommend this remaster for the hardcore SATB fan, and anyone who likes a good pop-rock album that still stands the test of time.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|Paranormal Activity is shocking. This film will make believers out of people who did not previously believe in ghosts or spirits . This footage may look so real but to your surprise its just very good acting. This movie is about a women that was being haunted since a little girl. The hauntings werent as bad but when she got older the demons became so strong and extreme . Not even priest could help this women and her boyfriend out. So they tried to solve the problem their selfs, but it didn't work the demons took over. I suggest you don't watch this horror film alone, because i know for sure you will have very bad nightmares. Just be sure you check this movie out. You'll never see life the same. BY ALEXIS MEDINA .

The box office hit was made for less than $15.000 and as of wednesday has grassed a whopping $65.1 million. Its horror in the truest sense of the world.

B0026P3G12|3.0|I was one of the millions of people who were captivated by the voice of Susan Boyle last year and have been eagerly awaiting her CD release. I just finished listening to the song previews however and I am a little disappointed, and it's not with Susan. Simon Cowell did a very poor job of producing this album. She has such a powerful voice that he has not exploited on here and he should have. All of the times that I have heard her sing before, she had such passion and spirit, on here however, that is mostly repressed. Hopefully she will find a different production company for her next go round, one that will help her realize her recording potential. Also, just as a side note, I love Celtic music and I think it would be really cool if she could team up with some well known musicians, like The Chieftans perhaps, and do a Celtic album. She has the perfect voice for it, strong but at the same time sultry, powerful but longing. Anyway, she's Scottish, so it's in her blood.
0061864153|5.0|This is a beautiful book and a definite must for any Bon Jovi fan!  It contains gorgeous photographs and interesting writings from each of the band members of the world's most popular rock band.  I would definitely recommend it to any Bon Jovi lover!!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Let me just say that there is no doubt in my mind that this is absolutely THE BEST Disney/Pixar film, ever.<br /><br />This combo pack has it all, I haven't had a chance to check out the BD Live things yet, but just the fact that I can let a friend borrow the DVD, while I can watch the Blu-Ray from my PS3 or simply watch it from my iPod while my Blu-Ray stays safely in its case. Awesome!
0450040186|4.0|The book was in good condition. It took a while to get to my house in Dallas, TX. I would have liked to be informed that it was shipping from ENGLAND!!! I would not have ordered it if I had known it was going to take so long to get here because it was coming from overseas. Please let the buyer know where you are shipping it from.
B001KZVQJI|4.0|The ultimate HD movie, fantactic picture and sound. Great family movie for those with older (over 13?) kids. Only objection is that it's a bit L O N G, and that's the theatrical version--not the extended one which is 14 minutes L O N G E R. Better viewed in 2 sittings for this household.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|The video quality of this release is as good as it gets and definitely showcases the capabilites of HD.  The movie has a great story... I've watched it 5 times and I still get teared up at parts, especially the first 10 mins or so.    Great movie, great presentation, great extras, buy it!
B002NXSRVG|4.0|WOW! One of the best all round movies I've seen in some time. A great melding of action, imagination and super effects. If you like sci fi, comics or the military at all you gotta see this one.
1401207529|4.0|First off I've got to say this is the first batman title I've read in years.  Only recently getting back into comics I decided that I wanted to check out a batman title and found this low priced used on amazon. Since it covers the origin I thought it might be a good place to start. Plus I've heard so much about frank miller I was very excited to read something by him.    Well after finishing the book I can honestly say every good thing I've heard about Frank Miller and about this book were definantly true. He delivers a deep exciting story with out the over need for all the bad guys we tend to see in most batman titles. It also shows us that Bruce Wayne didn't start out doing everything perfect. Matter of fact far from it. Which is nice, it adds a level of realism that we rarely see in comics.    The art work was very nice for the time, but doesn't exactly hold up to current comic's art.  But still not bad.    Now for the one major short comming, which is the length. It was super short, so short that they put in stuff like letters and sketches to fill pages it seems.  Plus for the life of me I cannot find any direct continuation of the story.  If anyone out there knows of one please let me know[...]    But over all I highly recommend this to all comic book fans and especially batman fans.  Only deducted one star due to the length to what would other wise be a five star rating.
0810983915|5.0|My son is not overly excited about reading but when a new \\"Wimpy Kid\\" book comes out, he wants it right away and will read it in one night. He loves the books so much he has read them again and again! The charecter is someone that young kids can identify and laught with. It is a great book.
B001FB55I0|4.0|the blu ray is off the hook and is one of the better ones i've seen. the movie itself is not bad at all. i think people were expecting mcg to pull a james cameron but of course that wont happen because hes not james cameron lol. he still gives you an interesting story with good special affects. this is a lot better than what i was expecting so i give it a solid four.
B000B7QCKE|4.0|The dvd quality, great music from Yanni, but the cd is not full song list like dvd???  Wishing we have blue ray version.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I knew that I was going to see this movie from the moment I heard the conceptual idea of his rehearsals being made into a motion picture film. I saw it the first night on October 27th at 11pm and I've seen it 3 more times since then.    Michael was REMARKABLE and FANTASTIC! I just couldn't get enough of looking at him and feeling his soul up there on that screen. The dancers were on point and the band was jamming every note the way he wanted it; when they had it just right.    I read someone's critique of the movie and it said that Michael had on long sleeves during the rehearsals. I would like to say...THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE to me because I'm sure the AIR was on HIGH in the stadium and Michael didn't want to catch a chill and get sick with the flu or get hoarse in his singing voice. I don't know why people make such dumb observations and publish it without thinking through what they are saying.    During the 8 hours of my watching Michael upon that screen, I never once felt that he was not here anymore. I was so happy to see him at his most energetic self and showing his finesse and power at the same time. I was smiling and feeling blessed to be watching him make the attempt to bring his Mega-Talent back to the stage for everyone to see that nothing was tarnished about his skills. Throughout the whole movie, each time I watched it, I was totally engaged in every single movement that he made. The only time my eyes left him is, of course, when he wasn't on the screen.    My only beef is with one of the theaters where I went to see the movie. The first movie theater closest to my home has the BEST sound system and you can hear every single decible of what's on the screen. The music was rumbling inside of me like I was sitting right there in the stadium with them. But then I went to this other theater to check out a different atmosphere and I was SO NOT HAPPY because the sound system in the speakers seemed to be unbalanced. The music and the voices weren't the same level of pitch or something of that matter. I don't know why they would have a CONCERT MOVIE's sound system setup like that.    The 3rd time I went to see the movie was again at the theater nearest my home and I knew then for sure that the other theater's sound system was OFF. The 4th time, I had to go again to the other theater with the bad sound system because it wasn't showing near my home that weekend. I wasn't too happy about that because they actually charge $3 more than the one nearest my home, but I went there again anyway because I HAD TO SEE MICHAEL ONE MORE TIME before they took it from all the theaters. Even with the sound system still unbalanced, I focused on Michael and loved every minute of watching him do his thing, just loving him more and more every second.    Also, I never saw the film with more than 25 people in the theaters that I visited. I had wished that I could have seen it at least once with a full theater to feel the energy of everyone enjoying themselves. But then I thought, this was great that I didn't watch it with a lot of people, because I wasn't distracted or annoyed or disturbed by not hearing something being said on the movie because of excessive noise from a crowd. I accepted that as a blessing in disguise and didn't let it bother me because I know that in areas all over the world there were theaters that were filled up on more than one occasion with lots of happy fans.    I have a pair of nice wireless headphones that I know will give me great sound at home when I get this DVD in my hands. I'm going to watch Michael in this movie on a regular basis until I can see it in my dreams. LOL And the additional DVDs will be mine, as well. I CAN'T STOP THE LOVE and whatever lets me see him and hear him speaking, singing and dancing is what I have to have in my possession. LOL    I hope all the people who didn't take the time to go out and see this movie at the theaters will buy or rent this DVD like crazy because it's worth every single second and every single dime to witness the MASTER at his work.
B0009K7RES|5.0|I decided to buy this CD when my Song For Sonny Liston started skipping on my Shangi La CD.  This is a very nice compliation of some of Mark's most recent works.  Every serious fan should own this.  If you are not a fan it is a good introduction to his most recent work at a great price.
B002GIBVV6|4.0|This is a charming version of The Secret Garden and much the best of the recent efforts. I still wish the 1940's film was available. I have fond memories of it. But this film will delight the young and remind the older of more innocent times.
B001UDYI9K|5.0|I was greatly saddened to hear today of the death of Eric Woolfson - a brilliant songwriter, singer and musician, who had continued to produce captivating and intuitive musical works across a range of genres.    This fine album is a singer/songwriter album with the artist himself performing, for the first time, all the lead vocals, as well as the core instrumentation.  The songs are as nuanced, poignant and at times, gently humorous, as his fans might expect.  Along with a few lost APP era treasures, Woolfson does versions of songs from a number of his musicals - \\"The Golden Key\\" makes a particularly welcome opener.  The tracks are suitably produced with everything from orchestra to Ian Bairnson guesting on guitar on \\"Any Other Day\\" to a complete lost APP recording.  I always hoped that Eric might one do an album covering his own APP material, but in many ways this was even more of a welcome surprise!    Taken on its own terms, this is real musical treasure and an essential document from someone who will remain one of greatest modern songwriters, and who is sorely missed.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I was 13 years old in 1964 and when I listen to The Beatles I think of nothing but good times and If music can do that after all these years then that says something. I am still amazed how John and Paul were able to write so many songs that seemed effortless to them. Mono vise stereo? I always use my i-pod and I can't tell the difference. That maybe because I worked close to 40 years in a job with extremely loud surroundings.  [[ASIN:B002BSHXJA The Beatles Mono Box Set]]
1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink sets about to find out what really motivates people to do what they do, and he discovers that what business does is far different from what science tells us.    The book starts by talking about various psychological experiments over the past few decades which have proven something that seems somewhat intuitive - we humans are intrinsically motivated to explore, investigate, and be creative individuals. However, when applying extrinsic rewards (in other words, money) to try and motivate this behavior, studies have found that paying people to exhibit creative behavior actually backfires - being paid makes people perform worse!    To combat this the book goes into the three things that will increase an individual's sense of intrinsic motivation - autonomy, mastery, and purpose. By focusing on those three things, and not simple \\"carrot and stick\\" style rewards, Daniel Pink shows how to create far more motivation in people.    I must say I loved this book. Many of the things that are stated in the book are things that I've felt in my gut over the years, but have never been able to verbalize. Daniel Pink not only verbalizes those feelings, he shows scientific studies which prove it out. If you are a teacher, a boss, a manager, or a leader of people of any sort, you should definitely read this book.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is a very good movie. If you need a good laugh then this is the one to watch.
B002MW50KO|5.0|This is one of Dylan's most satisfying albums. People often forget that Dylan's genius lies in his ability to shape, morph, transmogrify, and cut through words. His brilliance is not in his lyrics but in his delivery of those lyrics. With that in mind, it doesn't matter what songs Dylan sings, so long as he sings them. His early '90s albums \\"Good As I Been To You\\" and \\"World Gone Wrong\\" are excellent examples: all songs are extant folk songs, and he discovers new truths in those rusty, dusty gems. Same goes for \\"Christmas In The Heart.\\"    \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" weeps. \\"Christmas Blues\\" lilts. \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" glitters. Dylan plumbs buried tinsel from Christmas chestnuts long wearied from commercialism and overplay. If that's not genius, nothing is genius. If you grew up with these songs and love Dylan--and not just young Bob, but old, haggard troubador Bob--then you will love this album like a tattered childhood Christmas stocking.    \\"Christmas In The Heart\\" is a genuine, honest, rough and beautiful album. Advice: treat yourself to an early Christmas gift. And do it guilt-free. All proceeds go toward feeding the poor.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Alright, first off, not a big ST fan.  I remember watching reruns of the original when I was kid - that's about it.  Not sure why I wanted to see this movie but I'm glad I did.  It was awesome.  Eric Bana was an unusual choice for the villain but he did a great job.  Oh, and the scene with Kirk and the green-girl cadet was priceless; a wink back to the old days when Mr. Shatner was shagging green aliens?
0385341008|5.0|This book is so engaging from the very first letter!  I finished it in a weekend. Then loaned it to a friend and she read it just as quickly.  I got so wrapped up in the characters I felt like I was one of the literary members.  I had to get on the internet afterwards to see actual pictures of the island.  I strongly recommend this for anyone that enjoys reading or even just a WWII buff.
0895260131|5.0|Readable, and well laid out. There are even other arguments to make in the distinction between the Quran and the Old Testament left out. The comparison is the first thing that people tend to bring up.say \\"Well, if the Quran is the source of Islam, Islam is no different than Christianity because Christianity (and for that matter Judaism also) teaches violence in the Bible too.\\" The first difference is even if the Old Testmament did in some one time instances endorse just war, war for personal profit was utterly precluded. The other side of the total destruction coin was also \\"No booty.\\" That in fact made war hard and detestable for Israel and not something to lust after. Further, the nations Israel fought against were depraved to the point of cultic prostitution. Think: you live in a country with a state church that sponsors little brothel rooms in the back of the church with girls and boys both from the youth groups. They sell themselves to raise money to pay for the new building fund for Moloch's new temple. Unbelievably and worse yet, the nations Israel fought against also practised cultic child sacrifice. Think: the state church you do not even belong to just sent church employed troopers to your home to pick up your cherished and adored four year old daughter. She was just selected by a lotto to be handed over to have her throat slit and burned to please a non-existent god. How odd that we laud universal human rights but consider ancient Israel barbaric for ending that kind of evil (if even only in some cases). That world was so unimaginably grotesque that it is shameful but sadly nessesary for this writer to even illustrate. Now do we understand?
B001J710Y8|1.0|In its initial release, THE WICKER MAN was cut by 11 minutes, and scenes were shifted out of order. The result is a near incomprehensible mess. That appears to be what this disc contains.<br /><br />Instead, seek out the 1979 restoration (around 95 minutes) or the Canal Plus/Anchor Bay release of a reconstructed 99 minute director's cut version. After seeing the film, read the Wikipedia article ... THE WICKER MAN is one of the great overlooked horror/suspense films of the 20th century.
B001TH16DS|5.0|These items would have arrived ok if they were not but in a 11x14 box , an inch and a half deep that would fit 3 of these season cases .They had one dvd case worth of room to slide back and forth , you ever hear of bubble wrap ? These boxes were not even taped . Thanks alot for wasting my time going to UPS to return the original shipment and the  damaged replacement order too . Your shipping department needs to fire whom ever is in management to allow this ! You cost me time and gas !!!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|One of Hitchcock's most entertaining movies has been restored to the way it must have looked when it was originally released.  Colors and black levels are excellent. No spots, flicks or blips.  A truely amazing job. Just like watching film.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I changed my 1080p flat screen from the coaxial cable to the HDMI cable. The difference between the picture before I added this cable to after was amazing. The picture was so much clearer and sharper with outstanding detail and vibrant colors. I never expected just changing the cable could make such a difference. Why pay store prices of up to $70 when you can get such a good quality picture for $11 with shipping. And the frustration free packaging was a very common sense approach to packaging.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was the perfect culmination to a great series. It is by far the best book I've ever read. Now understand, it's not perfect, there are a lot of misused words in the book. That said, I care more about the story, and the story is what makes this book as great as it is. I won't put anything specific spoiler-wise in here, but the bottom line is that Stephenie Meyer actually dared to go against the common \\"doomsday\\" scenarios so loved nowadays. Yes, we actually get treated to a completely happy ending with no sadness. It's the ultimate delivery of how things can go right if you have the willpower to make it happen. A great way to end the series.
0307341542|1.0|The story had an interesting start, but about half-way through I was so fed up with the overblown and unrealistic characters that I put it down and will donate it to the next \\"Friends of the Library\\" book sale.<br /><br />There were many things that annoyed me about Camille Preaker, but the worst was her cutting habit. I'm sorry, but unless you're a contortionist, there is no way you can carve words across your whole body with the exception of a circle on your back. No way!

B000WMFZMY|4.0|When El Cid finally came out in DVD in the US (after having been available in various DVD editions in Europe for years), the quality of the picture and sound really did the film justice--both were outstanding.  Unfortunately, although it says above that this version contains a Spanish-language soundtrack, it does not, and the producers really missed a bet here, in view of the enormous popularity of the legend of El Cid in the Spanish-speaking world.  It is particularly unfortunate because there already exists an extremely good Spanish-language soundtrack on the 2004 Region 2 DVD issued by Divisa Home Video--but this was unfortunately coupled with one of the most awful prints of the film imaginable, and the Divisa print of the film is almost unwatchable, despite the absolutely beautiful and superbly refined Castilian Spanish on its soundtrack.  There is also a (supposedly remastered) 2003 version with a Spanish language track available from Front Row Entertainment, but as I have not seen it I cannot vouch for either the picture quality or the quality of the Spanish language soundtrack.  How long will we have to wait before the Miriam Collection reissues this magnificent version, with digitally remastered picture and sound, with a Spanish (and perhaps French) language soundtrack, so that it can be enjoyed in the language in which this epic was written?  There is already a German-language Region 2 version of this digitally remastered version available in Europe, so it seems perverse that a version with Spanish, French, and possibly even a Portuguese language soundtrack is not yet available as an option to go with this marvelously clear and beautiful version.  In any case, despite what it says above, this version does NOT have a Spanish language soundtrack, and the Spanish subtitles that are available on it are inferior to those in the otherwise poorly recorded 2004 Divisa Home Video version available in Region 2.  So, for those who want to see the film in English (andhave El Cid sound as if he lives in California, and Dona Jimena sound as if she lives in Naples, whereas both are supposedly from the same small area of Spain), this version is just fine--sound and picture are magnificent.  For those who would prefer to hear the wonderful Castilian soundtrack available on the Divisa version, there are no good options, as the picture quality on that version is terrible, and the Spanish language soundtrack on the digitally remastered version is nonexistent.
0061703257|5.0|I read this entire book in one evening because I could not put it down until I knew the ending. Page-turning, detailed and wonderfully written!
B001HN697M|4.0|You know Hollywood is running out of fresh ideas when they start making movies that mix and match old ideas together hoping for a hit.  The best example of this is in the horror - action genre where the trend of the decade is making movies featuring both vampires and werewolves.  So far, the two biggest franchises in this theme are Underworld and Twilight.  The latter is for teenage girls, while the former is better suited for everyone older.  The Underworld trilogy ends with this movie, starring Rhona Mitra as the blood-sucking babe instead of the usual Kate Beckinsale.  No worries for the guy fans out there, Rhona Mitra is every bit the babe in this movie.  This movie takes place in the middle ages of Europe, where we see the vampires create a race of werewolves to serve them as slaves inside their castle.  By the end of the movie, the werewolves have freed themselves, starting the blood feud between the two that is captured in the first 2 Underworld movies.      The movie is a mix of horror, action, romance and some drama.  The acting is fairly good, with multiple characters getting in some lines of dialogue.  The action is also good, with lots of blood but minimal gore.  The special effects are spot on.  My only caution is to watch this movie in a darkened room; as most of the scenes take place at night, a bright room will flood the viewer's eyes and diminish much of the detail of the movie's images.
1593080492|4.0|Though not as dazzling in wit as Pride and Prejudice or as passionate a love story as Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility gives the modern reader a true feeling of what it would be like to be a woman of limited means falling in love at a time when Romance was a matter of public discourse.  In Regency England, many Britons hailed Samuel Johnson, Isaac Newton, and philosophers of the Enlightenment as voices of reason and logic who relied on empirical data rather than religion or emotion to support their assertions.  Perhaps as a reaction to this matter-of-fact and somewhat dry philosophy, there arose a movement called Romanticism which hailed instinct, spontaneity, and feelings over careful analysis.  While ostensibly a novel about two sisters' journey to love, Sense and Sensibility is also an extended metaphor comparing the competing intellectual philosophies of Reason and Romance.<br /><br />The title Sense and Sensibility is confusing to many modern readers due to the words' virtually identical meanings in today's vernacular; however, in Regency England, `sense' was synonymous with 'logic' while `sensibility' meant something more along the lines of `sympathy.'  In the case of the novel, Elinor Dashwood is a woman of sense whose attitudes toward love are so rational that they leave the reader (and her sister Marianne) wondering if she is capable of falling in love at all.  Marianne, by contrast, is so in love with the idea of love (as sensationally depicted in literature and the arts) that she is quite literally swept off her feet without understanding the character of the object of her affection.  As the story progresses, Elinor and Marianne must deal with the not always pleasant consequences of their very different approaches to love.<br /><br />Although the novel focuses on the two sisters, Austen supplies the reader with plenty of entertaining supporting characters.  While Fanny's calculating manipulation of her husband John Dashwood results in the impoverishmentof the Dashwood girls, it also provides the reader with an entertaining twist on the classic stereotypes of the evil sister-in-law and the henpecked husband.  Likewise, Mrs. Jenkins' always uncomfortable references to husband hunting make the reader squirm in her chair, even as Sir John Middleton's endless commenting on hounds elicits eye-rolling.<br /><br />The men of the novel do not disappoint, either.  Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon all portray characteristics that make them worthy of the heroines' attentions, though they are quite the diverse crowd.  The reader may even find her own attitudes towards love deepen and evolve as she reacts to the dashing Willoughby, steadfast Brandon, and thoughtful Edward.<br /><br />In sum, this novel is beautifully written and well worth reading at least once, if not several times.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Yep, I bit the bullet and bought this blu ray even after reading the reviews, knowing full well it would be bad. Why? Because amazon had it on sale for $10 dollars, AND the Blu ray comes with a coupon so that if you own the original DVD release, you get $10 dollars back (so basically I got it for free, so why not?).  The transfer is absolutely atrocious. Yes, people who don't know any better won't notice it, but if you have a system properly calibrated and have seen a better transfer, the comparisons are ridiculous.  It is impossible to watch this blu ray and not be distracted by the lack of resolution and all the haloes around every single strand of hair, every spear, every building.  Why call this a \\"Sapphire\\" series?  Let's hope Joe six pack (most of those who think this looks acceptable) buys as many copies as possible to watch between Nascar races, so a better version can be released ASAP.  Even free this is not worth it.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|This is an awesome album!! I don't want to make Lady Gaga look bad by rating it lower because it's edited. I doubt she had full control over that. It's more important to kick her rating up where it belongs!<br /><br />Great album!<br />Innovative!<br />You won't regret it!<br /><br />(EDITING IS TERRIBLE! SO SILLY!

B0026P3G12|3.0|Had to go back and watch the original \\"Britain's got Talent\\" and I have to agree the album is way too sedate.  Even taking into consideration the audience and judges' reactions which make the live performance seem even more robust, I still feel the album got toned down.  I still like her, but it just wasn't the same.
6305313687|5.0|What makes American History X work so well is Ed Norton's acting.<br /><br />His charator, ex-neo Nazi Derek, had been in jail: he had actually brutally murdered a black man, but was not caught for this crime. While in prison, his life is actually saved by another black man, who he befriends.<br /><br />Derek comes out of prison reformed and is trying to save his younger brother, who is following the same path that led Derek to jail.<br /><br />We know Derek did horribly brutal things in the name of white power before going to jail. But he is shown in American History X as a whole person; intellgent, and working to find the right way to put his terrible past behind him.<br /><br />Watching, I found myslef caring for Derek dispite the despicable person  he was, because Norton has created an intigrated, vulnerable person in the charactor. Beverly D'Angelo also does outstanding work as Dereks sick mother--a far cry from her work in the Vacation films.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|As expected, this box set is great, everything as promised, nothing unexpected. The only thing I didn't care for was the price dropping $40 after I had purchased it. I can deal with a $5-$10 drop, but $40? That's a little hard to swallow. I would expect Amazon, in the future to price it correctly the first time, with only a little price correction, if necessary. It kind of puts a bad taste in your mouth about the seller, and you question if you will easily buy from that retailer again.
B002RSDW80|2.0|I was in the movie theater with eight friends, enoying this movie, when Julia Child's parents were introduced. They were depicted as horrible, conservative, California Republicans. The actors turned their parts into cardboard characters -- no depth, no complexity. The movie dismissed them as a joke. Later in the movie, more disparaging remarks are made about Republicans by Julie's boss. These scenes reflect much of the current need by Hollywood to denegrate anything conservative.    The worst part of the film, however, was the point where Julia Child's husband utters a gutter curse word. It was so jarring. There was absolutely no need for him to do that. He could have said something else and still made his point. It was a \\"shock\\" point which immediately took me out of the film. I suddenly saw two actors, not Julia and her husband. There are so few films these days without explicit sex, violence and/or profanity. While the movie had some tender and even funny moments, they were ruined by the director's choice to use offensive language and to put down certain groups. I had great hopes for this film, but now I will not buy it.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|The album overall is very good and goes perfectly with her previous one.  However, this CD is censored and there is NO mention of it on Amazon.  I feel this is misleading and makes me feel like I wasted the money when I could have purchased my music unedited elsewhere.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Underworld is a film that continues to water down vampires as most of us know them.  This process began with Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, but these stories still retained the horrific true nature of vampires even with a more relatable, human face.  Now we come to this day where between Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which I did enjoy) and Twilight (hate with burning passion) we have films in the middle of this watered down vampire genre that many have grown used to.  There's the good humanized vampires (Anne Rice), the bad (Twilight), and then there's the ones that just fall right dab in the middle and that would be where I'd place Underworld.<br /><br />The movie itself starts off with our heroine Selene doing her best to try and look like The Crow or an extra from The Matrix while she gives us a monologue on how the vampires and werewolves (which for some reason this movie has titled \\"Lycans\\").  She explains that she's a \\"Death Dealer\\" meaning that she hunts down the remaining Lycans.  Instantly we have her and another guy (we'll guess that in their exchange of head nodding he's also a Death Dealer) jumping down from the top of buildings and landing without harm on the concrete below...how convenient it is that no one saw them.<br /><br />We then somehow get this character of Michael Corvin involved as some...truly boring individual.  So when the vampires discover the Lycans have been following him so they soon send Selene to investigate it.  Selene and Corvin of course end up being together and escape the Lycans.  Does this mean we finally get a Vampire+Human buddy action film?  Of course not!  As awesome as that could have been Corvin has been bitten by a Lycan and monster 101 dictates he shall soon become one.  Now we realize the true plot intent of this movie is to be some strange, leather clad Romeo & Juliet.<br /><br />The rest of the plot...quite frankly bored me to tears.  Nothing in this movie ever paused itself to try and make sense!  They kept twisting subjects around and around, showed weird aspects of vampire society that may seem cool to eyes but they never really got any elaboration other than \\"here's this cool thing, now let's try for something completely different.\\"  It just wasn't a coherent storyline.<br /><br />Vampirism just isn't shown well in this movie.  Remember the days of Dracula, or even the adaptation of Interview with the Vampire some years back?  That should remind you vampires, and their bite are more sexual than anything else.  In Underworld there is zero sensuality in this act and it pretty much is only shown for the blood.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale is really attractive, but looks just can't save this film.  There is no chemistry between the leads and most of the cast seems bored.  No one really gets my attention in this film because they are all so very bland.  When the plot gets chugging along it has far too many characters to keep track of and when we finally discover the true villain of the film we are greeted to the most anti-climactic final confrontation I have seen in recent cinema.<br /><br />Now I will grant it the film does have some really good sets that obviously had quality work put into them, but that can't save the fact that the plot is a mess and the characters are unremarkable.  The director is essentially trying to knock-off Blade, The Matrix, and The Crow off all while in the same movie and it clearly shows in his awkward style as he tries desperately to replicate techniques that worked well in previous films of the genre.  So if you want a somewhat fun action movie this show is for you, but don't be expecting anything new, or for that matter even anything all that entertaining.ound, showed weird aspects of vampire society that may seem cool to eyes but they never really got any elaboration other than \\"here's this cool thing, now let's try for something completely different.\\"  It just wasn't a coherent storyline.

B002P6TA94|5.0|First off- I am a lover of almost all types of music but tend to lean towards rock/hard rock alternative etc .  Loved the new AIC and Them Crooked Vultures but... I have found myself continually playing the new Wolfmother over and over and over again ! Whereas the other 2 I mentioned - a few times was good enough \\"for now\\" . I saw Andrew( he \\"IS\\" wolfmother BTW ) in concert a few weeks ago and - wow- VERY impressed ! A perfect show as far as I'm concerned and I've seen MANY concerts in my 40 yrs of living - sounded spot on and was a total ham and interacted with the crowd incredibly !  The delux 2 cd edition is THE ONLY way to go as the additional songs are among my favs on the cd (the title track takes that honor for me ) .  Do yourself a favor and buy this asap - if you liked their 1st cd- you will LOVE this one !

B002P3J3BW|5.0|I was fortunate enough to attend three Horowitz recitals in the 1970's, while he still was in top form. I remember the thrill of getting the tickets to these concerts - I'd been collecting Horowitz albums for years and never expected I would have the opportunity to see the great pianist in performance. My experience was that what I heard in performance was just as amazing as what I heard on records. How many 76 year-old pianists would dare to play the Rachmaninoff sonata in recital? Horowitz, and it was a tour-de-force.  Yes, Horowitz could exaggerate things (composer-critic Virgil Thomson famously called him a &#34;master of distortion and exaggeration&#34;); and over time, I came to realize that his musical personality wasn't well-suited to certain composers (Beethoven, to name one). But when it came to Scriabin, Rachmaninoff, Liszt, Scarlatti, Chopin, and Schumann - the insight, creativity and energy he brought to these composers was unparalleled.  As for the albums: Horowitz started recording with RCA 1952, signed a contract with Columbia in 1962, and then returned to RCA in 1975. While Sony, which purchased the Columbia catalog many years ago, did a good job reissuing the Columbia Horowitz material on cd, the hatchet job that was done on the RCA LP's when they were issued on cd was appalling and I regretted buying most of them. Fortunately, this &#34;complete original jacket collection&#34; is a reversal of the ill-conceived programs that had been cobbled together on earlier cd incarnations; and instead of taking advantage of the 80 minutes that can be squeezed onto a disc, the producers elected to reproduce the LP's as they were issued, an approach that respects the artist's thematic plan for each LP as it was recorded, recognizing that an album is a sum of its individual parts and not just a collection of randomly chosen pieces. Furthermore, this set not only restores the LPs to their original configurations, but in my case replaces thousands of cd's and LP's, Horowitz's included, lost in a wildfire two years ago.  The sheer number of recordings in a reissue of this size demands a considerable amount of time to digest, and there are so many highlights that to comment on them almost implies that those not mentioned are in some way inferior. Nevertheless, for me the recordings that are most memorable (not in any order) include the RCA Scriabin album from 1955 with the forceful third sonata; the seminal 25th anniversary double album, from a Carnegie Hall recital in 1953, just before Horowitz's 12 year retirement; an earlier, even more sensational, Carnegie Hall recital double album from 1951, never before released except for Schumann's Clara Wieck Variations and a Chopin mazurka (and with a glaring cover typo wherein Carnegie is spelled &#34;Carnegy&#34;) - an incredible concert from beginning to end, including a kaleidoscopic Prokofiev seventh sonata and a shattering Liszt sixth rhapsody; the &#34;Piano Music of Chopin&#34; album (rec 1949-52) with the third and fourth ballades that uncoil like electrified snakes; &#34;Horowitz Plays Chopin&#34; (1957) including brilliantly conceived scherzi nos. 2 and 3 along with an assortment of nocturnes and an epic Barcarolle; the &#34;Piano Music of Mendelssohn and Liszt&#34; album (rec 1946-50) with remarkable recordings of Variations Seriuses, the Wedding March Variations, and a pulverizing Liszt Funerailles and 15th rhapsody; &#34;The Young Horowitz&#34; with Kabelevsky's third sonata and a beguiling reading of Tchaikovsky's Dumka; the 1951 Carnegie Hall recording of Pictures at an Exhibition, for which there are no superlatives except to say that it surpasses Richter's famous 1956 Sofia recital reading; the Rachmaninoff third concerto with Fritz Reiner, a benchmark recording. And this just covers some of the mono RCA recordings.  The Columbia material, which has been readily available on cd for a long time, is pretty much indispensable. Horowitz's 1962 debut album opens with a stunning remake of Chopin's second piano sonata, Rachmaninoff etudes tableaux that still raise goosebumps and then the pianist's arrangement of the 19th Liszt rhapsody. Along the way are novelties like the all-Scarlatti album, the all-Scriabin album (Horowitz's readings of this composer are truly unparalleled, but listening alone is not enough; go to Youtube and watch Horowitz play the op. 8 no. 12 etude from his 1968 TV broadcast, and Vers la flamme from a video made in his home, both simply astonishing), an all-Rachmaninoff album, and so forth - there's hardly a dud among them. Among the highlights is the double album drawn from various 1966 Carnegie Hall recitals, finally restored to its brilliant original format, with, among other gems, a biting and idiomatic Haydn sonata, transcendant readings of Scriabin's tenth sonata and Debussy's L'isle Joyeuse plus Horowitz's &#34;re-arrangement&#34; of Vallee d'Obermann - a supercharged traversal, even though Liszt didn't need any help from Horowitz in this case. Did I mention &#34;Horowitz Plays Chopin,&#34; opening with a sizzling Polonaise-Fantasie taken from a 1966 recital, and which also includes a genuine Horowitz &#34;find,&#34; the obscure Introduction and Rondo op. 16?  Horowitz's work after re-signing with RCA in 1975 is of a high order, although, as he aged, some of his later recordings started sounding less like Horowitz, which is to say, less superhuman. Interestingly enough, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing as the nervous edge that characterized so much of his work was gradually replaced by greater expansiveness and scope. The debut album for RCA presented two major works that were new to Horowitz's repertory, Schumann's &#34;Concerto Without Orchestra&#34; and the Scriabin 5th sonata. Next, however, came the Golden Jubilee Recital disc featuring a disjointed Liszt sonata, a disappointment especially in view of the pianist's famous EMI recording from the 1930's. The next solo disc was exceptional - Schumann's Humoresque, two pieces from Rachmaninoff gorgeously played and two from Liszt including a sumptuous Consolation No. 3 and an overwhelming Mephisto Waltz. The last four albums that Horowitz made for RCA are somewhat less interesting. There's a remake of the Rachmaninoff sonata, previously revised by Horowitz, that incorporates further revisions by the pianist; but it can't replace the scintillating version he recorded for Columbia twelve years earlier. &#34;Horowitz at the Met&#34; opens with a clutch of Scarlatti sonatas (Horowitz was a brilliant miniaturist), then an excellent fourth ballade of Chopin. Critics seemed to love his reading of the Liszt Ballade which follows, but it's filled with garish effects including splashy scales and turbocharged octaves that are completely out of place. But Horowitz could still deliver delightful surprises: the  1979/1980 &#34;On Tour&#34; album opens with an unusual choice, a superb Clementi sonata &#34;Quasi Concerto&#34; - who else played this stuff then? The three Rachmaninoff pieces which close this disc confirm once again that not even the composer played his own music as well as Horowitz.  Not everything Horowitz tackled came off well. His Beethoven, which I mentioned earlier, is not to my taste (the op. 101 captured in the previously unreleased Whitman Auditorium recital from 1967 is representative); and his Chopin recordings from the 1940's and 50's could be hard and edgy. Horowitz's temperament was very different from that of RCA's other pianistic star, Artur Rubinstein, something which is apparent in a side-by-side comparison of their Chopin recordings. For example, Horowitz's Andante Spianato & Grande Polonaise is driven, if not explosive, whereas Rubinstein's recording is a model of elegance coupled with virtuosity. For me, Rubinstein prevails. Generally speaking though, Horowitz had the wisdom to play what was within his musical grasp and to stay away from that which was not. And despite the occasional accusations of showmanship, which I think are mostly unfounded, Horowitz had a great understanding of tension and drama that transformed many of the pieces he played into great theater.  One quibble with this set is that the producers elected to reissue most of the discs organized by label rather than in chronological order by recording. Thus the discs Horowitz recorded and released by RCA are sequenced together, even though Horowitz stopped recording for that company in 1959 and didn't resume until 1975. Confusing matters, the previously unreleased RCA recitals such as the two &#34;Private Collection&#34; discs from 1945-50 and &#34;Horowitz Rediscovered&#34; from 1975, among others no matter what label they were issued under or their vintage, are lumped together after the Columbia material. It would have made far more sense to arrange the discs following the arc of the pianist's career: RCA mono, then the Columbia recordings, then back to RCA. One can, of course, rearrange the discs in the box, which is what I did.  Hank Drake, an astute pianophile who has written numerous articulate and knowledgable reviews for Amazon, has pointed out the only deficiency of substance, which is the mediocre documentation, replete with sloppy typos, that accompanies this set - but, as he himself acknowledges, the music is ultimately what it's all about. With this I completely agree.entation (replete with sloppy typos) that accompanies this set - but, as he himself acknowledges, the music is ultimately what it's all about. With this I completely agree.
B00014NE62|5.0|What a lovely & well made movie.  I never would have thought a scene of a chaste 2 seconds first hug between Hugh Grant & James Wilby could be so hot!  All of the actors did a great job of conveying the deep, passionate emotions narrated in the book while behaving within the Edwardian convention of conduct.  There are definitely some passionate scenes that I have rewinded over & over again because they are so romantic!  I would highly recommend the book as well - it is amazingly relevant a century later.

B0000E1WKE|4.0|In order to appreciate Whitney's Christmas, you have to just accept the fact that Miss Whitney is going to make every christmas song HERS.  I noticed she purposely tweaked EVERY song to fit her creative vision, so if you expect to \\"sing- a-long\\" to some old holiday favourites, you may as well forget it.  Whitney purposely drags on almost every note to each word in the lyrics and it seems like she was gunning for the \\"I Will Always Love You\\" effect.  It's a bit much and it borders on Whitney showing off her vocals.  There are moments when you want to say \\"damn Whitney, will u just sing the song\\".  You literally cannot sing-a-long to any of these songs without Whitney changing it up, twirling notes and ooh lording throughout.  This cd does grow on you eventually but it's something you have to mentally prepare yourself for and just accept.  It's a strange, mystical affair and it almost sounds as if Whitney was high in some of the recordings, like \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" where she goes on forever with the \\"pah rump pah pump pah's\\".  The best tracks are the more religious songs \\"Who Would Imagine A King\\" and \\"O Come Emmanuel\\".  Here Whitney just sings the songs and keeps it simple.  Overall it's a cute, intense holiday recording, but it's all Whitney's.

B002ZE85YW|4.0|[....]    Now, with that out of the way....    This \\"Rated R\\" cut of the film is truly the best version of it.  I don't agree with the way that some of the additional scenes were dropped in, but it probably serves the film better to not have eloquent wipes and dissolves.  That way, the viewer is dropped into it and it's an enjoyable ride.  McG and Co. really put forth the effort on this film, and contrary to the scathing reviews by the so-called \\"professionals\\", it is rather enjoyable.  It sure as hell beats most of the other films that came out around the Summer period!    The action, effects, and storytelling were done very well.  However, there are times when Worthington and Bale's Australian and English accents came out in the dialogue.  I must admit that it distracted me from the experience and reminded me that it was \\"just a film\\" until the next chase or explosion came along.    The Bonus Features Disc has some great behind the scenes and \\"how they did it\\" stuff, but was kind of short and felt like there could have been more.    Overall, a good effort and a good starting point for a new series of films.  Terminator films, even with their flaws, take us on a wild ride.  Mission accomplished.  I await the next one!

B000001ESJ|4.0|rush,s farewell to kings was the bands fifth studio album,that was released in 1977.after the amazing 2112 album rush kept the momentum going with this mostly brilliant album.although 2112 was mostly a concept album, farewell to kings combines conceptual songwriting and story telling with individual songs free from an overall concept theme.the farewell to kings period definately continued their sci-fi- metaphorical 10 minute plus mega song opuses.i wish i would have seen rush on the farewell to kings tour.for me the best tunes are;xanadu[one of the coolest rush tunes ever!!]in fact this album is worth it for xanadu alone!!however also geat are;closer to the heart,farewell to kings[title cut.]and finally the conceptual cygnus x-1 which opens the story of a space traveller that charts a course to cygnus x-1 which is a black hole in space. the space traveller gets caught up in the fearsome force of cygnus x-1...and the story is set and told on the next album;hemispheres!if your a rush fan especially 'kings period'it goes without saying this album would be a must for any serious rush fan!!!
B001RXB4FY|5.0|Let me premise this review by stating I listen to all types of music. Everything from Mozart to Boston to Metallica to Opeth. I tried this album because I had heard \\"Wild Rover of Hell\\" on XM radio's Liquid Metal. Granted that song is probably the heaviest and fastest on the album, the entire album is great. If you see reviewers having a hard time comparing it to other artists, that's understandable. It's different. That's about the best way I can describe it. I suppose the reviewer who compared it to Metallica (older, riffy Metallica) meets Rock-a-Billy hit it closest. Throw in a little Green Day and a little My Chemical Romance and that's about it. If you're looking for something new and are open to different things, give this album a shot. I am so glad I did (I now own all of their albums). I hope they begin to gain the recognition they deserve.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|QT is the sort of film maker who can in fact, sneak up on you.    I didn't want to like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Death Proof, etc...but dammit...I did.    If there is one thing about this film to contrast it to QT's previous works, it's the subtly he employed. That's right...you read the word \\"subtle\\" in context to a QT film. Let's face it, the man is not shy about gore...and this one could have been SO over the top...World War two? Nazis? The theme absolutely vibrated with the whole \\"splash another bucket\\" wantonness.     But instead Tarentino produced a movie that I was half in love with.     Improbable as the story line was, (and let's face it...to say liberties were taken with history is a bland understatement.) it WORKED.    It reminded me of the films of the thirties and forties because there is no doubt that some of the scenes were LOVINGLY shot...giving the whole film a patina that is as unforgettable as some of the classic lines we will be repeating into our golden years.    Bravo to Tarentino...for managing to surprise us yet again...this one is a keeper!

0811870987|5.0|The quality of this book is absolutely astounding.   The photography is superb; incredible detail, color, interesting compositions. Even though the photographs are on a completely white background they have a crispness, and vibrance due to the careful lighting.   The page design is excellent, wonderful contrast of sizes, shapes, color and great use of the white space.  Oh, and the birds? Beautiful. A reminder of how amazing natural creatures are, how detailed the plumage, the delicacy of color, the silkiness of black feathered birds, and then the quirky details of theirs beaks, claws or other amazing details the photographer has picked out to show us.  A very impressive project, beautifully executed.
0156027321|5.0|Piscine Patel is a 16 year old boy from Pondicherry, India.  His father, a zookeeper, takes his wife, a younger brother, and Piscine (who chooses to rename himself \\"Pi,\\" like the Greek letter and mathematical symbol) on a long voyage to Canada.  The main passengers are all sorts of animals, huge and small, who must be relocated to various zoos.  For reasons completely unknown, the ship sinks and the only survivors are Pi, a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan, and a ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  Pi and his animal companions wind up on a large lifeboat.  Darwin's law ensues, and the only two left are eventually Pi and the tiger.    This is a truly marvelous and incredible adventure story.  As stated in the novel, this is \\"an astounding story of courage and endurance in the face of extraordinarily difficult and tragic circumstances.\\"  That Pi and Mr. Parker form a symbiotic relationship, akin to a friendship, while travelling on the Pacific Ocean for several hundred days, is nothing short of amazing.  Pi's seeming good luck may also be related to his belief in and his practice of Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity.  How can God not protect such an unusually pious young man? Or so we are led to think.

B000086EOE|5.0|Wow! Quite the feat! Obviously, a great deal of work, and love, were put into this album, not to mention production!       Having heard Genesis mostly from \\"Selling England by The Pound\\", onward (except for \\"Watcher of the Skies\\") there are some songs I'd never heard before. The third, for example, is a killer instrumental with Steve playing an insane, frantic Jeff Beck-like, seething solo. In fact, Jeff was one of Steve's influences, and he quotes Jeff (from the Yardbird's: \\"I Can't Make Your Way\\") fom 6:05 to 6:11 minutes into the track, \\"Fountain of Salmacis\\", one of the great pieces I'd never heard before.     Prior to that, (though I haven't really read the notes), I'm guessing that's probably Steve singing through some device on \\"Dance on a Volcano\\", which I'm sure most people would agree would have been much better suited to Paul Carrack, (who sings on a couple of other pieces), in the upper registers. However, in a couple of sections (when the vocal \\"octavider\\", or whatever it is, goes ominously low) it couldn't sound cooler! Perhaps if he'd sung the \\"whole\\" song like that, it might have worked better.      But there's plenty of amazing things happening throughout this album. Like \\"Watcher of the Skies\\",(imagine Steve playing this with King Crimson, since three key members of that band are playing it with him), and the amazing interpretation of \\"Firth of Fifth\\", with some beautiful classical guitar in the middle, and then Steve demonstrating he's one of the best rock guitarists in the world in the following section, not just with speed, but taste, and (more importantly something sorely missing these days),\\"creativity\\". The orchestra, at the beginning of this piece, recalls something enchanting, and beautiful not unlike \\"Nutcracker Suite\\". Too bad that section wasn't even longer! \\"Your Own Special Way\\" is nice, but occasionally there's a little synth \\"riff\\" that sounds a little too \\"soft rock\\", but Steve (I think wisely), leaves out the familiar riff in the chorus, and does a brilliant solo, that I can't possibly imagine being topped by anyone on the planet!      \\"Waiting Room Only\\" is the \\"strange\\" piece, pretty much a \\"Number Nine\\"-ish, weird bit of Hackettry- at first. But by about two minutes into the piece, it starts to get rather interesting, and soon, more \\"musical\\", with some fairly cool stuff going on.      I have to admit that I don't really care for the following version of \\"I Know What I Like\\", except for the funny bits, and the famous solo that Steve pretty much keeps intact and even adds to, that is only now becoming deservedly recognized for being the very first \\"real\\" example of the two-handed, finger-tapping technique in rock guitar, years before Eddie Van Halen unjustly got all the credit.      At the beginning of \\"Los Endos\\", Steve demonstrates that he can play a pretty decent bit ot Flamenco, and then the band goes into high energy mode, the rest of the song being intact with all kinds of great little moments, with great drumming and layered drums, synth guitar, mellotron, and so forth.      Overall, a great album, especially for the usually low price. But if you're not that familiar with Steve Hackett, he has even better albums- since, and prior. But this is still a \\"keeper\\" considering that almost all of it is superb.

They did this very well in my opinion. First off with a great cast of characters...

B001FB55HQ|1.0|The movie gets one star only because I can't give it less. Transformers was Shakespeare in terms of writing compared to this crap. Was this written and edited by a 12 year old?  Or is this the mean mentality they think viewers have?  The previous Ts were enjoyable movies because they didn't expect a lot of you and you didn't expect a lot from them and they did not insult your intelligence -- they kept it simple.     If you haven't figured it out in the first 10 minutes, the moment you see Michael Ironside you should have a clear idea of what you are in for. This movie sucks, simple as that.      The writing is beyond poor, I am shocked this has been positively reviewed at all. Did people see a different movie than I did?  In this movie: everyone yells; people do the stupidest things that make ZERO sense just to propel an action sequence or some ludicrous plot device; every cliche you could ever groan about is crammed in at every conceivable opportunity; the big monster robots come with a soundtrack from War of the Worlds -- complete with people collection cages (yawn); strangers will immediately give up precious food if you have a cute kid with you (who conveniently carries a tummy pack overflowing with little 3M bandaids (to put on the strangers little scratch so we feel their \\"bond\\"); oh, and if said stranger comes up to you and takes your gun but won't tell you anything about them, by all means you should immediately take them to get a vehicle (because they are so easily attainable), oh and if you by chance happen to turn on the radio (?) well the first song that will come on will be something 'special' to him; and, finally don't forget to ask him to be your leader, so what you have had no other dialogue between you and you don't know anything about him and you live in treacherous times...      I kept leaning over and asking: is this really this dumb?  Yes, it really was that dumb. Waste.

B002QEXN2K|4.0|I'll start by saying that I was definitely in the minority when it came to reviewing John Mayer's last studio album, \\"Continuum.\\"  I know most won't agree with me, but I felt that on that collection Mayer was trying too hard to distance himself from his roots and show the world that he could handle jazz and blues as influences.  For me, it made for an album that felt somewhat forced and contrived.    It didn't help that at the time of the release of \\"Continuum\\", Mayer came out with several interviews where he spoke poorly of his previous efforts, labeling them juvenile and unsubstantial.    For what it's worth, I think \\"Heavier Things\\" is a solid, four-star album.  And \\"Room For Squares\\" is a classic, well-worthy of a spot on my list of ten albums that would go with me to a desert island.  I don't expect everyone - specifically John Mayer - to agree.  But those albums are chockfull of the music that I personally like, whereas \\"Continuum\\" is more of an artistic statement and far less listenable.    So what does all this have to do with Mayer's latest release, \\"Battle Studies\\"?    Well, a lot of people have criticized Mayer for sliding backwards into some of his old grooves.  Again, I disagree.  If anything, I think he learned plenty from the more experimental work done on \\"Continuum\\" and applied it to what he already knows and does well.  The result is a less anxious, wholly confident album that exudes Mayer's style smoothly and effortlessly.    Be warned: this is a mellow, thoughtful album and that the \\"Rocker John\\" from, say, \\"Bigger Than My Body\\" is missing here.  But \\"Battle Studies\\" is so flawlessly conceptualized that I can't help but feel that this is entirely what Mayer was striving to achieve.  The result is a wise, sharply-stated and introspective collection of slow-to-mid tempo songs that I find infinitely listenable.  My favorites are the opener \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" (with its U2-influenced lead-in), \\"Assassins\\" and the hook-laden \\"Half of My Heart\\" (although the \\"with Taylor Swift\\" moniker is a bit of misnomer... she sings only two lines on the song.)  Best of all is the dreamy yet earnest \\"Edge of Desire\\"... it's something of the flipside of the coin created in \\"Come Back to Bed\\", a more serious and realistic take on romance as we know it.  I LOVE this song.    I also have to say that Mayer's vocals are stronger on \\"Battle Studies\\" than on any previous project.  He's always had a good voice; here he moves into smokier, more textured territory with awesome results.    The album closes with \\"Friends, Lovers or Nothing\\", which is classic John Mayer, the kind of song that you just know is one of his from the first few chords.  And that's where the success of this album lies: it's good, solid music from a good, solid source.
0689865384|5.0|I love books describing futuristic settings and I am happy to say that this book is a great new addition. This book is set in the future in a tightly controlled city where the youth population is eager to receive their surgery that makes an individual symmetrical and beautiful. This surgery serves as a way to control the whole adult population in an effort to make them docile and compromising. Our heroine Tally must readjust all of her values when her friend Shay escapes from the city to the secret \\"smoke\\" village. Tally is given a tough choice, help the \\"specials\\" (government agents) track down Shay and the Smoke or never receive her surgery that she has been wanting forever. This is the first book in the Uglies Trilogy. The 2nd and 3rd are just as riveting and action packed as the first. I can't WAIT until the movie comes out!!!!!!

B000JVT09C|5.0|I can not describe in words how much I love this movie. It was the perfect sequel to Superman and Superman II, starring Christopher Reeve, and I grew up watching those movies. It had to be just right, done perfectly, or I would have despised it.    Brandon Routh played Superman the way Christopher Reeve did, and did so well that at times it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, because he portrayed the character to such a tee. With Christopher Reeve unfortunately out of the running to play the role, *I think Routh was the only one who could fill his shoes. He paid tribute to Reeve very well.    Lex Luthor's character was a little edgier and angrier than in the original movies, but that is doubtless explained by 5 years' imprisonment, and he wasn't so over the top that it completely distorted the original character. Lois Lane's character was well-portrayed by Kate Bosworth. Although she seemed a little malnourished, she had spunk and I actually liked her in the role better than Margot Kidder.    As a film-score fan, and one who grew up humming John Williams' original Superman theme, the score also had to be perfect, and John Ottman not only retained the theme, but also worked himself to death to ensure that the entire film, from beginning to end, had an A1 score. I hope that John Williams was proud of Ottman's work, because he should have been.    Word has it that the Superman franchise is on indefinite hold because of legal battles over rights and royalties. It is also rumored that WB was so unpleased with the film's nearly $400 million gross (?!) that they might take the franchise in an edgier direction in the future. That would be a horrible mistake... Superman is not, and never has been, dark or frightening. It is not Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, or anything even remotely like it, and it never should be. This film was the only way it could have been done, and kudos to Brian Singer for reviving a legend.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|I was actually at this concert, so I was expecting this not to be as good as being there.  I was wrong.  The DVD makes me feel like I'm sitting back at Citi Field.  The CDs sound amazing too.  The 2nd DVD is Paul's gig on the Marquis of the Ed Sullivan Theater when he did Letterman.  All discs are pictured like baseballs and have Paul's signature printed on them.  They are enclosed in a great colorful booklet of pictures.  When I flipped through the pages a card fell out.  I picked it up and its a picture of Paul with his signature printed on it and on the back it has #of nights at Citi Field, # of people, stats.  It's a baseball card!!!  Throughout the concert there is great crowd footage.  Paul had a flip camcorder given to him as a gift, so he held a contest for ticket holders.  Winners were to use the camcorders at the concert.  When they turned it in after, they left their names and addresses.  After the concert footage was taken, the camcorders were sent back to the winners.   If you want to save some $ you could just get the CDs or the standard edition DVD, but if you are a Paul fan, or you are buying a gift for a Paul fan, this is a must have.  I know this is the umteenth millionth live something that Paul has put out, but you won't be sorry!!!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Totally awesome voice.  She sings the songs I have heard a thousand times and makes them fresh and new.  A lot of emotion in her voice.
B001FB55I0|5.0|It's difficult these days to please a sophisticated world audience.  We've seen it all and it takes a lot to move us, inspire us, make us feel the gamut of emotions and be entertained.  Yet this installment of the Terminator series does just that.  IMHO, it ranks as one of the best epic science fiction movies ever produced.      The acting is outstanding, the characters are endearing, compelling and artfully developed.  Christian Bale plays the perfect relentless and conflicted John Connor. Sam Worthington beautifully brings the brave heart of Marcus Wright to life along with the tragic circumstances of his existence.  Moon Bloodgood excels at playing the beautiful Blair Williams a woman with unflinching strength and conviction.  The sweet youthfulness and fearless persona of Anton Yelchin playing a perfect Kyle Reese along with newcomer Jadagrace Berry (Star) together make the perfect complement of innocence contrasting starkly with their life on the bleeding edge.     The special effects were first rate, along with the script, sound and pace of the movie.  If you love sci-fi, you're going to love this movie.
0385504225|1.0|I didn't finish this book.  The same cat and mouse chase.  If they make this into a movie it will have to be filmed mostly in the dark. I loved DaVinci and Angels and Demons. Save your money and time.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is hardcore surrealism, theatre of the bizarre in a grim land of constant WTF. If you call yourself a film buff or even just a lover of the weird, and haven't experienced Eraserhead... it's time to schedule an appointment. Once Dr. Strange is done with you, explore the bonus oddities which include an extensive on-camera monologue by the director with call-in guests (really), coupled with archival material that will explain how the movie was made but conveniently avoid explaining its meaning.    Get Lynched. There's no going back.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost has not lost it. The fifth season shows a series that not only is able to keep up its pace but also to improve with time. While the central cast has reduced itself to a handful of characters who have returned from the Island, this actually allows the series to focus more on stronger storylines. As has been said before, during season 5 a lot of questions are addressed and sometimes answered: we get to see the Dharma initiative quite in detail. While this explains quite a lot of things about what happened on the Island previously there are still many central issues that go unanswered. Also some new twists are uncovered. Some of the parts dealing with time-travel on the island do probably stretch the imagination a bit too much but otherwise the content is of really high quality. We get to see some really strange things , mainly centering on John. The enigmatic Richard and Jacob are also seen some more but not much is learned about them. It remains very entertaining and hopefully will do so until the end.
1582701709|1.0|I am 45 years old and grew up with a mom who had been part of the New Thought Movement since the late 1940s. Not only was she an adherent, she was a teacher and a lifelong student. Even she lost faith at the end of her life until I pointed out that she'd manifested exactly what she'd always wanted... someone waiting on her hand and foot, 24/7, paid for, with all her needs met. Granted, it turned out to be in a nursing home paid for by Medicaid and Medicare, but her care was excellent and it was truly a great facility.<br /><br />And that's how it REALLY works. She spent her life dreaming these big \\"The Secret\\" style dreams... and putting her focus on the positive... and life dealt her some pretty crappy stuff anyway. She was so positive, in fact, I'd have to say she was in her own world most of the time. In the end, I was glad for that.<br /><br />The Secret is a book of stolen ideas and compiled simplicities. New Thought, by itself, has some very valuable things to teach us about managing our minds and creating a sense of union with the Divine, however one defines it. What New Thought does NOT teach is that one should just sit around, thinking happy thoughts, and wait for the money (or whatever) to land in our laps. One can interpret it that way, but that's a very immature way to see it. What New Thought teaches is that by working to more closely align ourselves with the Divine, and allow ourselves to be an expression of that Divine, we will necessarily have a better life. Managing one's mind is the key, not wishing for things.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I am alarmed by the focus on \\"act like you're rich and you'll be rich\\". NO, you will be in debt up to your eyeballs and your friends and associates will view you as a snob with no grip on reality. The author would undoubtedly say that I just don't get it. Really? I was raised in New Thought... I did not find a book, or collect a group of \\"experts\\" that include Feng Shui (totally unrelated to New Thought) and money making seminar leaders.<br /><br />This book illustrates the real danger in New Thought. It is very easy for a newcomer to take only the surface level idea of \\"improve your life\\" and turn it into something like \\"The Secret\\" - a shallow compendium of \\"get rich quick\\" thinking. The section on health is equally alarming. People get old. People get sick. People die. This is part of life. Does that mean we have to necessarily suffer greatly while doing these things? Not today -medical science has many options for making these realities easier for us to navigate. But the idea that aging is all in your head is patently absurd. Nature does what nature does. It is important to align oneself in a healthy way with what's real... some of what's real is the idea that yes, our thoughts have a profound effect on our lives (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, anyone?). But it is so much more complex than what this book asserts.<br /><br />The author also does a tremendous disservice by never mentioning Ernest Holmes, the father of Science of Mind. Come to think of it, it's actually better... he probably would not want to see his work associated with such simplistic nonsense. She does, however, mention Charles Fillmore (who I met as a child at Unity Village, MO...) and Catherine Ponder (whose works my mother read a great deal... and which I have also read several times). Fillmore was a delightful man who walked in light and was a lovely poet... I am unconvinced he'd be happy about being mentioned in this book. Ditto Ponder, whose prosperity books talk a lot about God... not about wishes.<br /><br />My point is this: Real New Thought is WORK. Doing it right is WORK. It is good work, and meaningful, helpful work to improve your PERSON-NESS. The problem with The Secret is the utterly silly way things are presented. Wish for it and it will be TRUE!!! Wonderful. I wish I was in Jamaica. I wish really hard... but here I sit in ice cold Colorado. I didn't want it badly enough? Of course...when it doesn't work, it's the fault of the wisher... when it does work, the author is a genius. Nonsense.<br /><br />If you are actually  interested in New Thought, start with The Science of Mind, by Ernest Holmes... the BIG book. Investigate Religious Science - preferably a group that is dedicated to old-school Holmes material. Read Mary Baker Eddy, though I don't recommend becoming a full blown Christian Scientist (though my grandmother was one and lived to her mid-90s quite healthy...). There are so many other options for getting at what the \\"secret\\" really is... that you are a child of Light, that you are manifest divinity... and the more often you awaken yourself to that reality, the better your life will become. It can't help itself...<br /><br />In the end, my mom, after a lifetime of immersion in New Thought, was dismayed by the turn it took overall to embrace \\"New Age\\" silliness. She understood what was happening... and this book is a testament to the watering down and oversimplification of concepts she held dear and spent a lifetime studying. But in the end, she died well, in the manner she had wanted - cared for, peaceful, and surrounded by love. How dare this author contend that getting old is all in your head. It's very real, and if we are LUCKY, we will grow very old, surrounded by our families and loved ones. THAT is how you can tell a life was well-lived.<br /><br />I am sorry to see that this book was so successful when it is little more than a get-rich-quick scheme for the author and her helpers. Great scheme... but bad medicine overall. Seek real New Thought, and you shall find it. As Richard Bach says, \\"You are never given a dream without also being given the power to make it come true. YOU MAY HAVE TO WORK FOR IT, HOWEVER...\\"e wisher... when it does work, the author is a genius. Nonsense.

0439023491|5.0|This book was an amazing story. I read the first book Hunger Games and demanded to read the next book. Catching Fire is so enchanting in a way. Huge twists and surprises make you continue to turn the page over and over until you are done with the book. Read the first book first so you can enjoy this book as much as I did. Suzanne Collins is and amazing writer. There is a loss of words if you take this book seriously and read it through. I encourage readers to read this book series.
B001OBT3FM|5.0|In my opinion, Anne-Sophie Mutter is one of the best, if not the best, and most talented violinists alive today. And, like a fine wine, she simply gets better with age!    She does not miss a single note in this playing of Beethoven's Violin Concerto.  I believe this is the best version of her playing this piece I have ever heard.  Simply magnificent.

B000TFINY6|4.0|Lost Continues to be the only television show that I watch with any regularity aside from the office. I may not be the most savvy SCI FI consumer; yet I feel that if you open your imagination a bit and go for the ride Season 3 will take you on a journey of emotions that range from frustration to cheer, and then tears.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|This is truly one of the best musical dvd's you can buy, not only is it Zeppelin but the footage/film here goes with the music so perfectly like no other band since.  This is pure magic and shows why Zeppelin even to this day is the greatest band ever.
B0000069KS|4.0|Fun to watch!  It has a kind of a plot to it.  It is good that it makes Ringo the central character.  He was most generally left in the shadows.  Great movie for your collection if you are a Beatles fan.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This blu-ray version has more footage than the DVD version. Watching it in HD is so much better and clearer. The ending gave me a complete surprise because there is a different battle with Sephiroth.
B000RZGFYS|4.0|I purchased this album recently just as a curiosity.  I had always heard about it and always wondered what the fuss was about.  My musical tastes tend towards punk and Americana, but I'm always open to suggestions.  My friends were into Slayer, Metallica, Megadeath and others during the 1980's, but I never saw the appeal so I didn't try.  Now I've tried it and I think this album is well worth the purchase price.  I don't think it is one of the best ever albums and I don't have enough background in metal to say if it is one of the best ever metal albums, but the experts say so and I really liked it so I'm not going to disagree with them.<br /><br />Every song on the album grabbed me and got my attention...immediately.  The interplay between King and Hanneman's guitars is where most of my focus usually ends up.  I really appreciate the fact that they don't let the songs drift off into five minute guitar jams, which for me tend to make the songs dissipate and lose my attention.  In general the songs are short and concise getting right to the point musically and lyrically.  The riffing is never stale and the soloing is literally face melting.  The two of them, through this album, have given me a new appreciation for metal guitar and the album it's self has given me am insight into metal that I previously did not have.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|Slayer never dissapoint, and this album is a worthy addition to the Slayer library.  The songs are awesome pure Slayer style thrash metal, Tom's vox are still excellent, Kerry & Jeff's twin metal assault is still as powerful as always and Dave's drumming is top notch.  This album is way better than Christ Illusion even though that too was an excellent album, this is my favorite Slayer effort since Season's.  Slayer rules!
B001US29I2|5.0|Joshua is 4 and he loves these legos.  He puts them together himself.  With his mother's love for him, he may have them all someday.
B00008O31H|5.0|This album should be required listening for fans of Indie/Blues/Hendrix.  Bubbling with energy, this is an album which will have you bobbing your head while you drive.  Simple in composition, it's very reminiscent of early Hendrix stuff both in overdriven single-coil pickup guitar, vocals and musicality.  However, The Black Keys stay on task in their tunes, not wandering off into solo bridges/riffs to the extent that Jimi did.<br /><br />There are occasions where the mix quality is a bit lacking (going to tablature sites, even those submitting lyrics for this group are unsure of what they are saying in some tunes)but they make up for it in simple grind and forward momentum.<br /><br />It's not a fancy album, very little overdubbing or effects, and that is what adds to its charm.  I have a couple of other Black Keys CDs and this stands out as one of their best.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Having grown up in a non-English speaking country I only recently came across the 2006 Jane Eyre movie - by way of recommendation from Amazon. I was doubtful at first whether I should buy the DVD as four hours seemed quite a lot of time to invest in something I had never even heard of. However, after reading all the glowing reviews on Amazon (US and UK), most of them being 5* reviews, I decided to order it. Am I ever glad I did! I loved every single second of it and really, the chemistry and sexual tension between Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens was absolutely sizzling. Both of them have truly expressive faces and eyes that can convey the most complex feelings with just one look! I felt every emotion they were going through. It was a revelation and a joy to watch - especially since this is so rare in today's world of plastic, expressionless \\"beauties\\" on TV or in movies. And of course the entire story of how Jane and Rochester fell in and found the love of their lives is so beautiful it makes me want to watch it again and again (which I do!!). I found them both so perfectly suited for their roles (contrary to some of the weird 1* reviews I read condemning the entire movie simply because Toby and Ruth were no carbon copies of what these reviewers imagined Mr. Rochester and Jane should look like ... mindboggling really!). I have one recommendation for these people and in Jane's words too: \\"It is the character inside that determines a person, not the outer shell\\"! Might be worth thinking about!    What I don't understand either is the total obsession some of the so called purists have that Toby Stephens was too handsome or too young to be Mr. Rochester. To me he IS Mr. Rochester. I read the book after I saw the movie - I must have read a totally different book than the purists however, because I never saw an ugly man, certainly not by looking at him through Jane's eyes. Need proof? I think it is best to let Jane herself do the talking, so here she is \\"... And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No reader: gratitude and many associations, .... made his face the object I best liked to see ....\\" and further \\"Most true is that \\"beauty is in the eye of the gazer\\". My master's colourless, olive face .... firm grim mouth - all energy, decision, will - were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me ....\\". He also had beautiful eyes as Jane mentions at least twice \\"... in his great, dark eyes, for he had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too ...\\" and again as she was drawing him while staying with her aunt before she died \\"Now for the eyes ... I drew them large, I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre, the irids lustrous and large ...\\". He was only \\"ugly\\" when compared to such inbred (the result of generations of cousins marrying cousins) \\"beauties\\" as Mr. Mason for example - Jane again \\"... fine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer examination, you detected something in his face that displeased; or rather, that failed to please ...\\" and then she concludes \\"... no power in that smooth-skinned face of full oval shape, no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low even forhead; no command in that blank, brown eye.\\" Who on earth would want a man with a \\"small cherry mouth\\" or as Jane says \\"a sleek gander\\" if you could have a \\"fierce falcon\\"? True, Mr. Rochester didn't seem to be very attractive when they first met but he was in a very bad mood and bitter, as he confesses to Jane after their botched wedding. I have never seen anybody looking good under such circumstances! And as to Toby Stephens being too young ... Well, when Jane met Mr. Rochester after his accident she thought he was approximately 35 years old, and later on she told Mrs. Fairfax \\"... Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young as some men at five-and-twenty.\\" Toby Stephens was able to make him look older and world weary at the beginning of the movie and he seemed to become younger and more playful the more he fell for Jane.    I truly believe that Charlotte Bronte's imagination skipped a few generations in the character of Mr. Rochester and she created a thoroughly modern, 21st century man. Of course Edward Rochester was flawed and imperfect (aren't we all?) but at the same time he was owing up to his mistakes, he was all man, considerate, not afraid to show his feelings, treated Jane (a woman!!) as his equal partner, had an athletic body (broad shoulders and narrow hips) and instead of being \\"ugly\\" was ruggedly handsome and had a great and sarcastic sense of humor (the best there is!) - In other words, he was the perfect modern man way ahead of his time!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Chills of awe ran down my body when I first heard Susan Boyle sing \\"I Dream A Dream\\" on TV. And again when I heard her sing \\"Wild Horses\\" (and I'm a big Rolling Stones fan). God has given her a voice like an angel! WOW! And THANK YOU Susan Boyle for not giving up on your dream and for sharing your amazing, awesome singing voice with the world! I bought two of these CDs so I could share the beauty with my Dad.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Okay, having grown up with Star Trek the Original Series, I had my eye on several comparisons. First, I have to admit the actors in this version are pretty good at immitating the original tv cast members. Second, this version is action packed similar to the tv series, and even Gene Roddenberry would be pleased with that. Third, the special effectes in this new movie just blew me away!     While I didn't care for some of the teenage dialogue and runaway future/present time scenarios , this movie did keep my interest from beginning to end. If I had to give it a \\"couch potato\\" rating, it would be a 4 out of 5 star for three reasons: (1) too many confusing scenes between Spock the younger and Spock the elder,(2) the entire Romulan crew were a bunch of over-actors and (3) I didn't need to see Kirk get it on with a green UFO (unidentified female object). On the whole, this movie is not as well written as Star Trek 2,3 and 6, but the cast's chemistry is just as tight as what I remember from the original tv series. I'm certain Hollywood will get a lot of milage out of this new crew.

1906694176|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this third and final installment of the series featuring the Salander/Blomkvist duo. This book is much more technical and dwells a little overly long on the Swedish justice system nuts and bolts. That being said it was a very satisfying conclusion to the best trio of books I have read in some time!
0823003590|5.0|I agree with what others have said about this book not living up to the title, I think it is really not anything approaching a complete guide to drawing the head, but still I would say this is a very good and useful book, particularly for those wishing to understand shadow and how to use it to convey form. It is, I think, perhaps better described as a book on light and shadow with the face, almost incidentally, as the drawing subject.    The book teaches the style of chiaroscuro, which here is basically explained as form described through light and shadow and not line. By copying the shadow shapes on the face, which is the essential lesson in this book, you are able to achieve more easily a realistic and recognisable portrait than if you were to have drawn with line and than later added shadow.    If you are looking to understand light and shade, beyond the usual light-shining-on-a-ball explanation, I think there is much of value here, regardless of whether you're interested in chiaroscuro or not, or the method of drawing given here. For light and shade, I have not found a better book.    The book is basically concerned with drawing from life or pictures and teaches how to translate what you see, the shadows, rather than what the various parts of the face and head are. I do not think it would a particularly useful book for those looking to learn the head in order to later draw from imagination, which I think is what one might expect from the title, nor do I see it offering much to the person who has just begun learning.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I have exercised regularly for 30 years, and I have never worked so hard as I did in Jillians 20 minutes. I started to notice my body changing after week 3. My only problem I injured my knee on day 10, but continued to modify the moves. Tonight I sit here with my leg iced and elevated after having knee surgery. So even with all her comments about being careful with your knees I still got injured. But I am going to get right back at this DVD when my knee heals.
B001GCUO4S|2.0|Anyone that gives this 5 stars must be on crack. Once again we are told the exact same story. Are americans so bored with there lives that they don't mine watching the same story over and over? This sequel is no different than all those horrible Saw sequels. The only reason they keep making these movies is because the originals made a lot of money. I loved the first Final Destination, It was a new an interesting horror film. We've gotta stop with all these dam sequels. This movie is not boring but you already no exactly what's going to happen. A bunch of lame white kids try to cheat death and death does what death does best. You would think by now these idiots would realize you can't cheat death. At least the first movie made this concept seem cool. This movie has no personality. It's a bunch of mediocre actors trying to make a horror flick. I've seen all the other Final D movies. So i didn't expect to be scared out of my seat but i did expect to be entertained a little. They could have at least switched around the story a little. Maybe, someone could have found a way to stop death permanently. Who knows, Anything would have been better than this. Watch this only if there is nothing else to watch or just rent the first one, its a classic.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|After reading The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons this book was a bit of a disappointment, not bad, but my expectations were maybe too high. Most of the book was ok, but at critical points when in a high energy situation the character breaks out into a diatribe lasting a couple of pages on the meaning of some obscure symbol. Then it took a while to pick the flow up again. It was almost like the book was finished and the editor told him to go back and add a few thousand words.    Overall it was a good read, just slow at times.

0679720200|2.0|The Matthew Ward translation is inferior to the translation by Stuart Gilbert. Using the French \\"Maman\\" does nothing for the reader of English and, in fact, detracts from the quality of the reading experience. Compare the last several lines of the two translations, and you will find Gilbert's much more powerful, even lyrical. When I first read Camus' book, which is my favorite novel, only the Gilbert translation was available, and it blew me away. When the new improved version came out, I read it and tossed it in the trash. Gilbert, however, makes Camus' lines sing with electricity. If you can get the older translation, do so.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I can't believe Paramount let them do this to such a respected franchise. The original series, subsequent series, and movies stuck to the same themes. This is just a cartoon with people in it occasionally. There's hardly any acting or drama, just computer generated animation. They've sacrificed principle for profit. When they were writing it, they must have said, \\"Lets see how many special effects we can cram into two hours.\\"    There are a few chuckles to be had, but overall I rate it one star and two thumbs down. If you can see if for free, it's OK, but I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|I received the CD within days of ordering it. It arrived in new condition. I am very happy with the service!
B002X20W2E|2.0|First off, let me say I love Ms. RiRi and think Good Girl Gone Bad was an amazing showcase of growth on Rihanna's vocal style and lyrics. So when Rated R came on, hailed as a growth in Rihanna's vocal and artistic direction and probably the best CD to date, my friend rushed off to buy it and we listened to the best album Rihanna's ever made...    It isn't a horrific CD, but I would only download a few songs, like Fire Bomb, Wait Your Turn and Stupid in Love. Everything else is just too hard. And it would be better if she really were hard; it comes across likes she TRYING too hard. Her vocals aren't any different than Good Girl Gone Bad, and it is too raw for young girls who used to love her, young girls who looked to her as a fashion maven. Now she just looks... well... a little skanky. Her profanity comes out as \\"Family Guy\\" cursing--profanity just to fill a line, not serving a purpose.    Like I said, I did hear some songs on there that I do like, but the majority of the CD is violence, guns, sex, talking smack, the arrogant \\"I'm so fly\\" and did I mention guns and violence? Definitely NOT for your younger counterparts. The only plus I can say is I didn't go out and spend $15 on the CD like my friend did.

B002SYXCVK|4.0|Typical pedestrian, holly-jolly holiday music does not pass in my household. While this is definitely NOT holiday party music to lift most people into the eggnog spirit, it's a soothing alternative to the endless parade of such artists as Amy Grant and Harry Connick, Jr., one tends to hear repeatedly during the holiday season. Sting's release will not be everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoy it thoroughly, including his unusual whiskey voice.
B001PR0YDA|4.0|Our family of 6 went to watch this at the IMAX and it was awesome! The effects are so great with 3-D, totally mystifying. The story as we all know is the typical Scrooge story, it may be a little scary for the younger kids (under 6 I'd say). But overall a delightful show that keeps your full attention. Jim Carrey is great and of course his eyes are identical to Scrooge! Colin Firth in animated form is a remarkable twin to his real self. I don't think I need to give you the play by play like some reviews, I'm just saying that we enjoyed it. Go see it, for the 3-D effects if nothing else, it's well worth it.

B002N5N4EE|5.0|The first time I saw Ghost Whisperer on TV I was HOOKED! The story lines behind the series episodes continue to fascinate and intrigue me. These story lines lead to the next installment in such a subtle yet powerful way that I can hardly stand the wait until the next episode.    Jennifer Love Hewitt is the perfect acting match for anyone having the ability to communicate with the Spirits...think me crazy, but I believe there ARE people out there who do exactly what she does. I had an out of body experience when I was 5 years old. I was very sick with a fever of 105.6 (according to my parents) and I truly believe I died for a short time. I could clearly see my body laying in the bed as I looked down on it from high above. I witnessed my mother rushing my body to the tub and pouring ice over it until I returned to it. That memory is burned into my mind like it happened yesterday.    As members of my family have passed on over the years, I have always felt a calm, very serene presence in the minutes, hours and up to a few days after their deaths that has made me a true believer of \\"The Light\\" and an afterlife. And because of \\"The Ghost Whisperer\\" I'm not the least bit afraid of death and am actually looking forward to it.    In my humble opinion, every episode has an extrememly emotional cleansing effect that I carry with me for days, weeks, months at a time...some are more powerful than others.    I want to own every single episode of this one.
B00001ZTFZ|5.0|I do not own Risk, nor have I listened to any of the tracks other than Crush 'Em and the live version of I'll Be There on That One Night... With that in mind, I am reviewing the bonus track, the Duke Nukem Theme, which is the only reason I can think of of getting this version. If you're a collector, you're going to get it anyway, right? First off, do not buy this particular album. $47 for Megadeth's worst-reviewed album? Why bother, when the Duke Nukem Theme appears on the 2007 box set Warchest and is available to download for $0.99 off of Amazon's own MP3 store?     Anyway, the song itself is, simply, an instrumental masterpiece. I'm not familiar with the original, but Mustaine's cover is glorious. From a static intro comes a simple but heavy riff, with the sounds of Duke himself groaning (as though lifting weights). He then says \\"Let's rock!\\" (the track is peppered with sound clips like this. After that comes a track that brings to mind why metal artists used to do instrumentals in the first place.     You know what, just give it a listen yourself. Even if you don't like Megadeth, there is nothing to hate in this song.  [...]

1592289444|3.0|First of all, any potential reader of this book should be (painfully) aware that the story is most likely NOT true.  The man who was the subject of this supposed \\"escape\\", Slawomir Rawicz, was in fact relased by the Soviets from a gulag.  He did not escape by winter and make it on foot to India.  Too bad ... because if he had it would certainly have been the most incredible escape of all time.<br /><br />People interested in the factual background should look up \\"Slawomir Rawicz\\" on Wikipedia - where they point out the discrepencies discovered after a BBC investigation in 2006.  I guess the author and Mr. Rawicz have been happy to keep collecting royalties on this book for a long time.<br /><br />However ... this is not the end of the story (!).  According to Wikipedia, an intelligence officer in Calcutta in 1942 did interview three emaciated people who said they escaped from Russia.  So could this actually have happened?  In 2009 a Polish man by the name of Witold Glinski claimed the answer was \\"Yes\\" and that he was one of the true escapers.  Supposing this new claim is true (and that's a big IF), could Slawomir Rawicz have plagiarized the real-life experience of another Pole? Good question.<br /><br />So the mystery goes on.<br /><br />Did anyone make it out of the gulags in the Russian winter - or was such an escape completely impossible? I have to say that I agree with skeptical readers in that I can't possibly see how hungry prisoners could walk long distances through snow.  It just doesn't seem possible - based on calorie requirements.  Perhaps some enterprising journalist will continue to shed some light on the accusations and unresolved claims surrounding this whole story line.<br /><br />DON'T buy this book if you want the facts.<br />But if you would simply like a good story - go ahead.
B001FB55HQ|1.0|Agree with other reviewers.  Warner pulled this same stunt with Trick r' Treat (only putting bonus features on the Blu disc).  I decided not to buy this dvd because of this.  There's no reason at all that the unrated version should not be available on DVD.  I understand that DVD cannot match the picture quality or sound that Blu provides, however, DVDs have always been able to support audio commentaries and bonus featurettes and to not put them on the DVD and still charge the same prices is ridiculous.  With all the firmware problems on Blu and the fact that my TV does not support HDMI (and I'm not replacing the TV until it breaks).  The more that studio pull this garbage the less likely I will ever convert to Blu.  In fact, I now hope the Blu format fails in favor of digital downloads for HD (with DVD still being available of course).  Very, very stupid Warner.
B002UZCJP2|3.0|The opening scene in Surrogates is something that stuck out to me, seeing as I am a sucker for faux-documentary style openings. Basically the first 10 minutes are done in a documentary style, to sort of introduce the surrogate technology and the setup of the movie. Then we leap into the conventional movie style. As good as the opening was, I also felt it was striving too hard for the realism of my favorite movie of the summer 09, District 9.<br /><br />WIllis stars in the movie, and if you've read the comic book you probably know what the movie's about- this humanoid technology named Surrogates, who promote a glamorous lifestyle. However, there seems to be something fishy about these so called surrogates- a man died after his surrogate got blasted away by a ray gun. This calls Willis to solve the mystery of the Surrogates.<br /><br />I will admit I rather liked the movie. It was fast paced and interesting to watch, especially with the action scenes and the suspense. Willis turns in a phenomenal acting performance, maybe his best since The Sixth Sense. The movie plot is pretty unoriginal though, which is what prevents the movie from getting anything above 3 stars. But with that aside, some great action and special effects made for an entertaining movie. 3/5.<br /><br />IN TOTAL<br />Entertainment: 6/10<br />Sex: 0/10<br />Violence: 7/10<br />RObots walking around the streets: Could happen<br />Bruce Willis: Malcom Crowe, anyone? Except future Crowe?<br />Action: Flash! Jump! Shoot! Anything like that really :D<br /><br />***Worth watching***

B002TZS5GU|3.0|Customers have been asking for all things Chris Pine that do not involve a Tremor brother theme (ala [[ASIN:B002VEJKQI Smokin' Aces [Blu-ray]]]) and unfortunately this film is all that is available at the moment.<br /><br />A virus has decimated humanity so a foursome with an unknown history are traveling cross country to hopefully find a safe haven. Along the way we get peppered with the usual long string of irritating moments and self defeating actions amongst this isolated crew. There are no zombies or nasty critters anywhere, just an infrequent mixing of other survivors out to save themselves. Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci play the brothers that lead this group, and they both give decent performances. The pace is not meant to be scary, and there is no horror (as the cover art would make you think - it shows the only real \\"jumper\\" moment with a dying person zombie look-alike). Some brief performances by Chris Meloni and a couple of [[ASIN:B001GCUER0 Mad Men: Season 2]] regulars in Moses and Shipka.<br /><br />The 84 minutes seems short, but for what they made the film about in ambiguity and lack of closure or big picture items, it fits. Go in not expecting anything huge, just a slow burn post virus kind of film that throws the moral compass decisions right at you. Not a bad film or an original idea, just nothing takes this DVD to the next level of being really good. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is a solid 5.1 with subs in English, French and Spanish - Spanish language track is included. There are no special features at all. 3 for the film and quality and nothing else.

So when I read that this version ('99), was better, it made me  curious enough to view it.   Well, I agree! This film is totally sharp and slick from the get go, and very  entertaining. I give it a 'thumbs-up' and 5*****.   Good work on a remake.

0385504225|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but solely for the symbology and noetic science. Dan Brown did a decent job with the plot and 'puzzle' that it hinges on, but that in and of itself would not have held my interest. Certainly the characters and writing are passable at best (although to be fair, certainly no worse than many pop fiction writers out there.) So, the occult history and symbol-reading was really the only thing that made this book worth reading in my eyes, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not interested in that (just as I wouldn't recommend his other books to anyone not interested in alternative views of the Catholic Church.)<br /><br />Of course, this can't be considered history. What Mr. Brown does well is comb alternative history and conspiracy theories for ideas, and spin them into a compelling web. In this case, he brings in some popular New Age ideas and 2012 theories at the end as well. And I think there are some subtler themes that are of interest, in terms of America's relationship to religion (and visa versa). But all in all, as other reviewers have stated, it gets a bit didactic.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|- Imported from Japan (But Still Good) -  When I first saw the box I could not find the Official Nintendo Seal anywhere on the box. All official Nintendo products have this seal(in North America). With closer inspection I noticed that the whole outside of the box was all written in Japanese. The instruction booklet was completely in Japanese also. Then I noticed one small patch of English on the back of the box which states \\"FOR SALE AND USE IN JAPAN ONLY\\". That answered my question on why the box and instructions were all in Japanese. I also learned that the Official Nintendo Seal is not used in Japan by Nintendo.  - Detailed Review -    So yes after all this controller is an official Nintendo controller made for Japan. The controller works, looks, and functions like the original controllers sold for the GameCube. The only difference is the cord is longer and it is white in color. I don't know if there is an official Nintendo of America version of this, I don't believe so because I have not seen it in stores or any other website. I do hope that Nintendo of America will eventually officially sell this product in the USA in the near future.   As stated before the manual is completely in Japanese and there is no English version included. That is not much of a problem because it is easy to use, all you have to do is plug it in and start playing. As far as warranties go on this I have no clue because it is all in Japanese and I am using it outside of the only country it was intended for. Nevertheless it is still a great product and you are most likely not going to need a warranty. My advice is to pay the cash for this controller because they work and will keep working. I have had 2 off-brand controllers fail on me and another on its way to failing. While all that was going on I had 2 original Official Brand Nintendo controllers that worked flawlessly, still work today, and I expect them to last very far into the future. I plan on buying another one of these so I have four official Nintendo controllers that I know will work and last for a long time.  - Final Thoughts -  If you need a good controller for your GameCube or to play GameCube games on the Wii get this one. Even with the Japan issue I am still giving it five stars. I don't care that it is from Japan, that is Amazon's problem and I wanted to let anyone reading this know it will probably be a Japan version so you are not surprised like I was.  PLEASE BE ADVISED: MAKE SURE THE SELLER YOU ARE BUYING FROM IS AMAZON DIRECTLY OR AT LEAST FULFILLED BY AMAZON. YOU WILL PROBABLY GET RIPPED OFF (KNOCK OFF, USED, ORIGINAL CONTROLLER NOT THE NEW EDITION, ETC) IF YOU BUY FROM ANOTHER NO-NAME SELLER.

0618001905|5.0|When reading Hochschild's \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\", one is struck not only by the enormity of the crimes committed in the Belgian Congo, but also with the puzzling and somewhat uncomfortable realization that this should not be news. It seems incredible that such events could be relegated to the ash heap of forgotten history. In the case of Leopold's Congo, the ash heap was more than metaphorical. Officials destroyed as much evidence as they could before the Congo was turned over the Belgian government, and according to Hochschild, \\"the furnaces burned for eight days, turning most of the Congo state records to ash and smoke in the sky over Brussels.\\"             While there has been a growing acknowledgement over the past few decades of the whitewash given to much of Western history, there has also been much criticism of \\"revisionist history\\". To acknowledge that ones country has blood on its hands in the past is seen as being unpatriotic or anti-Western. At best, such history is dismissed as \\"ancient\\" or simply lived by people who were \\"a product of their times\\". It is difficult, however, to dismiss Leopold's Congo as such. This is not \\"ancient history\\". Those who participated are not far removed from today's young generation, and were contemporaries of our grandparents and great grandparents. As for such men being products of their times, this is hard to reconcile with those living a generation or two after slavery ended in the United States, and more than a century after slavery had been outlawed in much of Europe.             And for what did these atrocities take place? What was the driving force behind such barbarism? Ivory at first, but what really turned the Congo into a slaughterhouse seems almost trivial when looked at in comparison to the murderous lengths undertaken to exploit the resource in question: Rubber. For this millions died and countless others were mutilated.               This is a good example of the laws of unintended consequences. Certainly Scotsman James Dunlop had no idea of the misery that would result from his invention of the pneumatic rubber tire. The Congo just happened to have the right resource at the right time in its abundant supply of rubber vines. \\"The industrial world rapidly developed an appetite not just for rubber tires, but for hoses, tubing, gaskets, and the like, and for rubber insulation for the telegraph, telephone, and electrical wiring now rapidly encompassing the globe. Suddenly factories could not get enough of the magical commodity...\\"     As with oil in later decades, rubber, a resource that the world had little use or need for a few short years earlier, suddenly became essential to the economies of the industrialized world. Even if the Congo had had any chance of relatively benign treatment by the West, the rubber boom would have sealed its fate regardless. Also, Leopold, with undeniable business acumen, knew that cultivated rubber, from trees rather than vines, would eventually cause a drop in price when rubber plantations in South America and Asia reached maturity. In the meantime, he decided to squeeze the Congo for every last drop before this happened, and \\"voraciously demanded ever greater quantities of wild rubber from the Congo...\\"             One might have expected Leopold's agents to pay Congolese natives a pittance to gather rubber, and still reap huge profits, but the reality was that human greed knew no bounds in the Congo. The natives were not paid at all. In fact, they were not even allowed to handle money. Instead they were forced to gather rubber by a variety of means, most of them violent or terroristic. In most cases, women and children were held hostage until the men met their rubber quotas. Those who resisted were simply killed. Even many who didn't resist were killed for not meeting quotas. Others died of disease and starvation, especially those in detention. Some died in the dangerous job of harvesting the rubber vines high in the trees. Those caught cheating by cutting the vine open, which yielded more rubber but killed the vine, were killed as well.             In other cases, Force Publique forces simply rampaged through entire regions, wiping out villages and massacring men, women, and children alike without distinction. In many instances, to prove that they hadn't wasted ammunition hunting, they were required to show a left hand to their commanders for every round of ammunition used. Uprisings, of which there were many, were dealt with quickly and severely. Huge areas were left depopulated through a combination of punitive massacres, terrified villagers abandoning the area, or communities that could not remain viable because the men spent so much time gathering rubber while their women and children were interned.     An English explorer at the time, crossing a huge 3,000 square mile area of the northeast Congo, was horrified at the \\"depopulated and devastated\\" wasteland he witnessed: \\"Every village has been burnt to the ground, and as I fled from the country I saw skeletons, skeletons everywhere; and such postures --- what tales of horror they told!\\"     If any one object symbolized the brutal cruelty of the Congo State, it would be the chicotte. \\"...a whip of raw, sun-dried hippopotamus hide, cut into a long sharp-edged corkscrew strip. Usually the chicotte was applied to the victim's bare buttocks. Its blows would leave permanent scars; more than twenty-five strokes could mean unconsciousness; and a hundred or more --- not an uncommon punishment --- were often fatal.\\" Chicotte beatings were meted out for every offense imaginable --- and often for no offense at all or for something as trivial as native children laughing in the presence of a white man.     As for these Force Publique men enforcing Leopold's will in the Congo, they were not soldiers or officers, at least not officially, but called, in rather bland corporate terminology, \\"agents\\". Such a mild and businesslike title hardly fits someone having the power of life and death over virtually every native in his area of operations. Not only did these men have such power at their disposal, but were more than willing to use it. Some did so because it fit their notion of necessary discipline. Others used such fear and intimidation to increase their profits. And still others seemed cut from a different cloth --- the kind of men who seemed to actually enjoy killing for its own sake. Among the most notorious of these was Captain Léon Rom, who displayed the severed heads of natives in his garden. He and several other Force Publique agents who went far beyond the bounds of an already cruel and brutal regime were the inspiration for \\"Mr. Kurtz\\" in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Another, Léon Fiévez, was still clearly remembered in local oral histories some fifty years after the \\"rubber terror\\". Said one local named Tswambi:     All the blacks saw this man as the Devil of the Equator... From all the bodies killed in the field, you had to cut off the hands. He wanted to see the number of hands cut off by each soldier, who had to bring them in baskets... A village which refused to provide rubber would be completely swept clean. As a young man, I saw [Fiévez's] soldier Molili, then guarding the village of Boyeka, take a big net, put ten arrested natives in it, attach big stones to the net, and make it tumble into the river....Rubber caused these torments; that's why we no longer want to hear its name spoken.      These were not aberrations. Nor were they were isolated instances of excess by a handful of agents. Such inhuman viciousness was widespread and accepted company policy. Few Europeans were ever held accountable for their actions in the Congo, and the few instances of punishment amounted to a show hearing and a slap on the wrist for those charged.     There is one man who is, if not ultimately responsible for the devastation of the Congo, the one person who set the stage for Leopold to carve out his personal African fiefdom, and he deserves mention: Henry Morton Stanley. Best known for finding Dr. David Livingstone, whom had been missing for years deep inside the continent, he was one of the most celebrated adventurers of his time, and even today most who have heard of him would simply say he was a great explorer. However, regardless of his feats in Africa, he held the people of that continent in utter contempt. He boasted about shooting anyone who got in the way of his expeditions, which were practically small armies tearing through the countryside. General Sherman, of American Civil War fame, likened Stanley's journeys in Africa to his own scorched-earth march through the South. Explorer and writer Richard Burton noted that Stanley \\"shoots negroes as if they were monkeys.\\"     Much of what is \\"great\\" about Stanley comes straight from Stanley himself. There were few corroborating witnesses to many of his exploits, though by his own words it is clear that he, like many Europeans, saw native Africans as little more than beasts of burden rather than as participants in his expeditions. The native porter, a familiar icon when one thinks of African exploration, was not the healthy, well muscled black extra seen in countless Tarzan films, but a broken, suffering native driven like a team horse, often given inadequate food and rest, and often simply left on the side of the trail to die when he reached the end of his endurance.     The use and abuse of native porters, while not as graphically cruel as other excesses in the Congo, was nonetheless a brutal and destructive practice. Perhaps portage does not get the attention of other atrocities by its sheer \\"ordinariness\\"---in addition to being a relatively slow and subtle road to death, it was a practice simply accepted and expected in Africa. And as was the case in so many other aspects of exploitation in the Congo, porters were rarely paid employees selling their services, but forced labor with little choice in the matter.As just one example, \\"Of the three hundred porters conscripted ... for a forced march of more than six hundred miles to set up a new post, not one returned. Stanley made extensive use of these men, and left a string of dead across half the continent. This in addition to those who were encountered and shot along the way---one imagines a native was just as likely to be shot approaching the expedition out of curiosity as he was with hostile intentions.     Admirers of Stanley would hardly think he could be compared to those who later raped and devastated the Congo, but it was men like Stanley who paved the way; not just by cutting out paths through the jungle, but by doing so with the mind-set that these lands were theirs for the taking and its inhabitants fit only to serve their ends, be it gold or glory---or ivory and rubber. Rather than being venerated, Stanley should be relegated to the ranks of those explorers and colonizers whom Peter S. Beagle invoked when he wrote \\"We are raised to honor all the wrong explorers and discoverers---thieves planting flags, murderers carrying crosses.\\"           \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" is a shocking, often gut-wrenching, and horrifying read. It is also a story that needs to be told, and more importantly, remembered.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like the overall workout and the combining of aerobics, strength and abs.  Twenty minutes of intensity will get you the results you want. However, I have one complaint.  In workout 2, there is an exercise where you go down in plank form and do a sort of jumping jack from this position. I have been working out with aerobics and weight training for over 25 years, so I'm overall fit.  This move puts way too much weight on the small calf muscles/tendons running up back of your calf and I know this because I ended up pulling this muscle tonight with  this move.  The tops of your toes is not a stable enough base to support this move and you run the risk of injuring yourself like I did.<br />Form is very important in weight training and in aerobics.  I would nix this move.

Her enthusiasm is quite comical, as she finds herself neglecting or begrudgingly attending to her duties, wanting nothing more than to get lost in a book.  I most certainly can relate!  Laced with a wry humor, this book emphasizes the power of the written word and its transcendence of race, gender, and social class.

Sandra Bullock is just adorable and what can I say about Ryan Reynolds, wink, wink.  If you love comedy and romance this movie is a must see, more then once.

0385532458|5.0|I read this brief book of short stories immediately after finishing Stephen King's latest 1,100 page tome.  What a lovely palate cleanser this collection of tales was after the all-you-can-eat verbal buffet I had just consumed.    Having lived in the Deep South my entire adult life, both the stories and the characters who inhabit them ring true.  I enjoyed every story in this collection.    Grisham isn't the most elegant writer, but he does know how to hook his readers and keep them entertained.
B002NPUCP8|5.0|Orianthi (she is Australian) is perhaps one of the best female guitarists I've ever listened to. She can play any difficult songs and has the style of Jimi Hendrix. I can clearly see why Michael Jackson picked her to be on his \\"This is It\\" tour. Her new CD is a mix of songs and all very well done. She not only sings well but you can hear her screaming lead guitar on every song.  Oh I forgot ..... she is very beautiful too.    This girl is hot in more ways than one !!!

1579128149|5.0|We saw this book on a table at a major book chain. He picked it up, flipped through it and put it down. He did this about 3 times and practically begged to get it (as if I would say 'no' to getting a book!)(and no, he does not need my permission). You'd have thought I was telling a 6 year old he was getting a new puppy, bicycle, and ice cream all at the same time.     My husband likes non-fiction books and books with pictures - a novel usually won't interest him and a cookbook without pictures will be ignored no matter how hungry he is. He doesn't have any particular interest in chemistry, but is curious about things in general and likes to know facts. This book grabbed him with the stunning visual aspects, but kept him interested with its logical layout and description and examples of each element. The info nuggets are interesting and useful - you won't be a chemist when you finish the book, but you'll know more about each element than you probably did before. He only reads a couple of elements a day. Conversations for the past 3 weeks have been peppered with \\"Did you know that (pick an element) is (something cool) and you when you mix it with (something normal) it (does something cool)?\\"     This is a winner for curious people that are very visually oriented. Even curious kids could get interested, but might need vocabulary help. This is a gift book that will get read.

0380730405|5.0|DuMaurier's classic novel holds up some seventy plus years after it was written. I is a wonderful prototypical Gothic tale. As the plot twists and turns, the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The characters are well developed (even somewhat overdeveloped in the classic style). The author's ability to write then entire novel without ever using the protagonist's Christian name is an interesting variation.<br />We read this for a book club. Some members had editions with an epilogue that was very confusing, conflicting and repeated a lot of information that is in the first chapter. After considerable digging on the internet, we found that this \\"epilogue\\" is actually notes used by the author in writing the book. To include this chapter without explanation is, in my opinion, a violation of the trust we place in publishers.<br />Overall, this is simply a great book.
B00009W0WM|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. I call it magical because for some reason it makes you feel so good when you watch it. I judge a movie by how many times you watch it and I have seen Casablanca in its entirety more than 2 dozen times, I love it that much. The characters are so rich and warm that you can't help but fall in love with all of them. The music is pure magic as well. Each time I watch it, I find another tiny detail that I fall in love with.  Can you tell I like this movie?...you will to, but like fine wine, it gets better with age.
B0000025WQ|5.0|I hadn't heard these songs in years! It was so refreshing to hear all the FUN these songs were! They're STILL FUN! Makes you want to get up and have some fun! OH, just caught that pun..so I guess it's true!
B001UV4XUG|4.0|I hate romantic comedies.  If they actually have some comedy in there, they are watchable but the relationships are often based some some kind of ridiculous premise that doesn't resonate at all with me.  To call this a romantic comedy seems quite misleading.  This movie was funny at times.  Well directed, at times...A little gimmicky at others.  Very well acted by the two leads.  The thing that I loved about this movie is that it is completely true to life.  It wasn't like \\"The Break-up\\" where you have to suffer through the couple arguing through the entire movie.  They show (in a very clever way) the highs and the lows of Tom and Summer's relationship.  I find myself still thinking about the two leads as if I was in their shoes (We probably all have been on one side or the other in our lives).  What do I think of them?  What do I wish she would have done differently?  What could he have done differently?  I don't know.  One of those movies that I can't stop thinking about.
B001NB33T0|2.0|If u have never ever heard the original Live at Leeds ,a six song sonic blast of power unlike anything you'd ever of heard before. I guess i am tainted by the original record I had. In the era of revisionist history and completest then this is fine, I just know if i heard the first track heaven and hell  instead of the blistering young man blues,i would of passed on this .So if you don't know any better then buy this one ,if your looking for that great blast of power from the past then ,well its hear but its all messed up . So buy it like I did and put the original 6 on the i-pod and the other tunes in the shuffle play list. and if your wondering what the original 6 was, don't buy the bull of this expanded track really improve on the original ,that's crap.     1.

B000S55516|5.0|This album came out in the '60's when I was about 15 & in my rebellious stage. I listened to an FM \\"underground\\" station that played music not heard on the AM pop stations. The original album cover was round & had pages that opened up, finally revealing the vinyl album. My record collection was stolen & I despaired of ever finding another copy. I was delighted when I found a copy on Amazon, and listening to it brought back all the fun times I had as a teenager listening to \\"underground\\" music. This was before Rod Stewart joined & changed the band, so it's got a completely different sound. While there are a lot of drug references, the songs are fun, and the side with \\"Happiness Stan\\" brings back a lot of fond memories. Definitely a cd for anyone who was a child of the 60's!
B00005JKGO|5.0|Of all of Fellini's films, this one is the one that most of my friends consider the greatest.  I adore it, admire it and consider it a masterpiece.  I still feel that `La Strada' and `8 ½' are his more accomplished works and the ones that I immediately flock to when longing for some Fellini, but `La Dolce Vita' (appropriately, or shall I say inappropriately translated `The Sweet Life') is an outstanding representation of how advanced foreign cinema is from what we experience here in the states.  In 1960 this Italian gem possessed more gusto, more acute sense of realism and more profound intellect than nearly 90% of what we had released stateside.  I'm not knocking American cinema (for I love it) but I am also moved by how much more realism and passion is found in foreign releases; especially those released in the 50's and 60's, before the 70's changed the way American cinema was constructed.<br /><br />This film basically follows the aimlessness that permeates the life of Marcello Rubini (an astonishing Marcello Mastroianni), a journalist who is striving to make something more meaningful of his work yet finds himself almost `struck' in the world of glamour, prestige and debauchery.  He is blinded by his ambitions, which are lost amidst the glitz and glamour that is splashing itself all around him.  Moving from one party to another, from one woman to another, from one drink to another; Rubini becomes another statistic, losing what makes him distinct and falling into the rut of complete abandonment.<br /><br />The final moment, on the beach, where he just abandons all hope of change and walks away...I mean WOW.<br /><br />This film is a complete showcase for Mastroianni, who just runs us through the gamut of emotions with his three-dimensional character.  He delivers charm, wit, rage, depression, sensuality, hysteria, apathy...everything.  Watch the way he completely crumbles without moving a muscle when he realizes what a (close?) friend is capable of.  Notice the way he reacts to his fianc&eacute;s rash decisions.  Watch the way he completely explodes when finally pushed too far into the hole he is trying desperately to climb out of (that confrontation with his fianc&eacute; is just brilliant).<br /><br />He is just marvelous, from top to bottom.<br /><br />This film is a brilliant look at the way life can encompass and conform you, even when you are fighting fervently against that said conformation.  It showcases the way you can become completely overtaken to the point where your struggle is apparently in vain and you guard is destroyed and next thing you know you have given up and embraced all that this `sweet life' has to offer.<br /><br />Sweetness has never left such a sour taste.y he reacts to his fianc&eacute;s rash decisions.

B001K98MFA|5.0|This anime is very well done in every way.  It has a deep storyline that keeps you interested.  All the voice actors also do a great job.<br /><br />If you are in any way an anime fan look at Ghost in the Shell series.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|An absolute classic! I quote more one-liners from this film than I even realize! BJD II was stink-o, so stick with the original and you'll have hours and hours of laughs about the follies of thirtysomething singlehood.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I bought this mic about 2 months ago along with the Kodak Zi8 camera. The volume is so low that it makes the mic completely useless. I have NO IDEA what the other reviewers are talking about, and it's interesting I've now found the same reviewers/reviews on other sites. Makes me wonder if those reviews were seeded by the company - how many people go around posting their Amazon purchase / reviews elsewhere?    It works the same every time I have tried it - with my camera, with my laptop. It's a total waste of money and I recommend that nobody buy this.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I noticed a lot of people griping about how the one song featuring young strapping scrooge and his then \\"girlfriend\\" was cut. I have to admit, I'm a huge Muppet Christmas Carol fan, but that song was awful. The girl's voice was terrible and it was kind of an embarrassment to the movie. Back when all we had was the VHS version we always rolled our eyes and fast forwarded through that song. My family and I were pleasantly surprised when we saw that we didn't have to skip that part on our own, the DVD was cut. If you really want to see what you are missing, I'm sure you could look it up on youtube, and then it will be obvious why it was cut.
B001PE26QQ|5.0|The Legend of Ip Man is one of the greatest martial arts film ever  created. Based on the life of the Gung Fu master of the late martial  arts legend, Bruce Lee, it gives insight into the man who set Bruce  Lee on his road to stardom. Donnie Yen's depiction of Ip Man was right  on target. An A+ performance with incredible fight choreography by another  martial arts great, Sammo Hung. I would recommend this film to anyone who  loves martial arts films. Donnie Yen was beyond great in this excellent  film about the man who spread the art of Wing Chun to the world.
B000006SGT|5.0|The original British band The Animals was very popular and immensely influential.  Many music fans around the world had their original exposure to various artists from John Lee Hooker to Ray Charles, from Nina Simone to Lonny Mack listening to their early albums and especially to \\"The Best of the Animals\\", which had no filler and was filled with perfectly chosen renditions of roots and original songs.    While their early albums conformed to the routine of a few \\"hits\\" with more filler, their work has stood the sense of time, especially due to their many significant original songs.    Eric Burdon, wanting to move from the roots-folk-rhythm&blues mode to become a psychedelic rock artist, bought the band's name around 1966, created \\"Eric Burdon and The Animals\\", but failed to provide musical experiences at the standard set by the original band.    Along with the Yardbirds, The Animals failed to ultimately rival the studio work of the Rolling Stones, but never failed to inform, entertain, and express emotions vital to the era.    Bob Dylan decided to go electric after hearing The Animals version of his existing piece of material, already recorded by Dylan, The House of the Rising Sun on the radio!    I RECOMMEND this collection VERY STRONGLY!!!  jHawkTX, the Texan from Kansas.

B0026P3G12|2.0|This was just not as exciting as hearing her live. Her live version of \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" was so much better and more powerfull than this. Her original recording of \\"Cry Me A River\\" was also much better than this. This cd was so mellow that it actually bored me to death. I don't like the gospel tracks or \\"Day Dream Believer\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" was out of place.
B0018CWESK|5.0|Super fun flick - Sort of a funky, cool homage to all the vintage monster movies it's based on.  Frankenstein, Dracula, Werewolf, vampires, etc. all rolled into one.  The casting & actors are superb!  Awwwesome special effects, costuming &  period sets.  Visually robust w/ an amaaazing rendition of Dracula played by Richard Roxburgh.  His super hot 3 vampire wives are not to be missed.  An all-star cast, including Hugh Jackman & Kate Beckinsale in sexy roles that rival X-Men & Underworld, if you can believe that.  The bonus features are well done & well worth the extra few bucks.  A little tongue-in-cheek but entirely entertaining, esp. if you watch it more than once.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I really enjoy this CD.  I wouldn't normally choose this type of music, but I loved the movie and I was pleasantly surprised to find I like these songs too.  I've listened to it many times over and I enjoy it more each time I listen to it.  I highly recommend this CD.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|You'd be better off putting a bag of popcorn in the microwave, turning off the kitchen light and wondering what the noise is when the Redenbacher starts popping. You'd save yourself about 90 minutes, and even more time calling yourself an idiot for going to see this annoying piece of trash. Maybe you could hook a little string up to the microwave and open and close it all scary-like, get out your Fisher Price camera and start rolling ...<br /><br />As Helena Blavatsky used to say, \\"Shake a little powder on the floor, demon do a little chicken dance,\\" or something like that.<br /><br />The joke's over. The joke's on you.
B001F290E4|4.0|I like Seal very much.  He has a sultry voice.  His lastest CD Soul is a very nice CD.  Of course, its not like the original, but Seal did a great job on this CD.  I do recommend it highly.  I hope to Seal live one day.  Enjoy the music.

1594488916|2.0|I did not like this book.  The author drags an article into a book format and the padding she adds is totally airy fluff.  The author does focus too much on herself, she vacillates between telling what she knows and drawing out the book.  I was quite disgusted with her by the end of the book as I believe she should have spoken up to the authorities as she uncovered more of Gilkey's stolen cache.  I think she displays reprehensible behavior and morally bankrupt ethics.  This book ends up being a clear picture of her own amoral attitudes toward completing a book about a thief who should have been actually jailed for grand theft.  All in all, a very poorly written book, with lifeless characters, and simplistic narrative.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I'll just start off by saying I went out and saw this movie 3 times at the theater. To say I liked it would be a serious understatement. It's basically an origins story, which I generally have problems with. Usually it takes so long to establish everything, that the film is usually about over once things finally pick up. No such problems here. Even though Kirk doesn't officially take over with only about 30 minutes left, there is more than enough inbetween to satisfy the most harsh action and/or drama fans. I'm very happy to say the action gets to be shown, in brilliant fashion, right from the beginning. I'm an unapolagetic action fan, and I appreciated not having to wait 90 minutes to see any. I thought the film was extremely well-paced overall. Visually it;s very impressive. I thought characters like Uhura, Bones, Scotty, Sulu, and the villain Nero could have been developed more. Putting Nero's deleted scenes back in may have done the trick there. Still I had no big problems there.     I thought the film was well cast and the story both moving and interesting. Pine, Nimoy, and Quinto especially stood out, although they were supposed to. Sure I could nitpick here or there, but the different timeline allows some much needed leeway. I'm just not as much a stickler as many are. I understand that change is needed and happens. Not saying I always agree with everything that is changed or not explained, but I also understand 40 years of material is being re-arranged and told in only 2 hours. Just no way it could be seemless even it it wanted to be. I'm one who believes the film could have been longer to better explain things, plus I just selfishly wanted to see more.    If I had one real issue or worry about the film, it's that I didn't always feel Kirk's character was being portrayed strong enough. Just felt they concentrated too much on his cocky side, and thereby humbling him, and not enough on his nobil side. He wasn't all swagger! Most seemed to enjoy his portrayal though, so I think I could be overreacting. And it was earlier in his career.    The extras were great for the most part. Would have liked a actor's commentary and maybe a little more behind-the-scenes stuff, but all-in-all, I can't much complain. I just hope they make a sequel.
B002IR3PQ4|5.0|It is impossible to put all of Queen's hits on to a single disc.  However, this cd makes a nice effort to do so.  Every song here is great.  My only complaint is the exclusion of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" and \\"Bicycle Race.\\"  For my money, I would have included those and omitted \\"Heaven for Everyone\\" and \\"A Kind of Magic.\\"    The real gem here is the second disc.  This disc is like listening to the audio commentary on your favorite movie.  Each track is played (in a shortened format), while Roger and Brian comment about the song- how it was written, produced, etc.- and it is really cool to listen to.    If you are a new fan of Queen, I would recommend picking up \\"Greatest Hits\\" (the US version, so as to get the full length version of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\") and \\"Classic Queen.\\"  But if you insist on a single disc collection of Queen, this one does a pretty good job.
B000026I4E|5.0|I only recently heard of Mercedes Sosa. I bought my first cd just to see how good or bad it was. I was so surpised when I first listened to her voice, the lyrics, the pasion and compassion she had for the human race. Soon after I got the first one I bought 3 more of her cd's-----and I'm still enjoying them.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Christine Collins, a mother of a 9 year old son, returns home from work one day to realize her boy is missing. She reports this incident to the police, who few months later find another boy that matches her son's features and deliver him to Christine. Christine denies that this is her boy where in fact the police insisted that he is. When Christine keeps denying this is her boy and goes to the press, the police uses all means possible to keep her mouth shut, including throwing her in a mental hospital without a warrant.    Quite sad movie where every mother will strongly relate to Christine's feelings and sacrifices made in search of her son.    Justice prevails in the end, however not necessarily with a happy ending.    Angelina Jolie and the rest of the cast performed their roles in this movie extremely well.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I've seen this movie twice and just ordered the DVD, so obviously I enjoyed it.  It is a very entertaining film and Tarantino fans should be quite pleased.  It was, however, not quite up to Kill Bill standards in my book.  I've tried to put my finger on why and haven't yet been able to figure it out.  They both had great actors, great dialogue, great cinematography and they were even both revenge flicks, but Basterds just misses the mark slightly for some reason. If Amazon allowed it, I would have given it 4 1/2 stars because of that vague feeling of something not being quite right.  But heck, how many movies these days are even 4 1/2 stars?  See it; it's definitely worth the time.

0330485385|2.0|I've heard of this book, of course, for several years. I finally decided to read it after seeing previews for the movie. The way the book starts is promising. The first few chapters (and last few chapters) held my interest but I kept waiting for something more to happen. Actually, I kept reflecting back to the movie previews which make it seem more like a thriller or intense drama. That's not what the book is like. The book is more about an exploration of the grief process--in about a half a dozen characters. There's just as many subplots in the book which is too many! I think Alice Sebold should have picked 1 or 2 characters and and plots and focused on them. Instead, she tries to do too much and loses the effect she wanted to create. Overall, I think the book is a waste of time. Just my opinion, but I think the movie might be more interesting than the book--how often does that happen?
032147404X|4.0|- Gives you practical advices  - Written with humor  - Talks to both Canon and Nikon users (Including the instructions given in text \ images)  - Assumes you know nothing, great for beginners    The reason I didn't choose the 5 stars rank is because I'm one of those guys who looks for the theory behind  the practical advices, and I think you won't find too much of that in this book..  (Scott Kelby: \\"This isn't a book of theory - full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts.\\")    In my opinion, the overall is good, I enjoyed reading it.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|This review is for; [[ASIN:B001AVCFJM Star Trek (Two-Disc Digital Copy Edition)]]<br /><br />It seems the most popular trend in Hollywood is to make prequel films instead of sequels. George Lucas made a prequel trilogy about how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. Christian Bale showed an extensive background of Bruce Wayne in \\"Batman Begins\\". The long running James Bond film series had a prequel film \\"Casino Royale\\" and most recently even the X-Men film series had a prequel film in \\"Wolverine\\".<br /><br />As a long time fan of Star Trek's original series from the 1960's, the new film is a great homage to the original characters of that great series. The new film shows the brief childhood upbringings of Kirk & Spock and how they would eventually meet each other at Starfleet Academy in San Francisco (with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background of the futuristic settings). We are exposed to the rebellious, cowboy diplomacy of Kirk and the logic-driven motives of Spock. We see a very young and sexy Uhura that has a flirtatious fling with Spock, but despises Kirk. Funny, I thought that should have been the other way around! We see a young McCoy that complains about his bitter divorce and further explains about how his ex-wife took everything except his \\"bones\\" (his eventual nickname in the TV series). We also see Sulu who confesses he is an expert fencer, a heavy-Russian accented Chekov and the bright engineer, Scotty who is stationed on a remote ice-planet, but stumbles on the rest of the Enterprise crew by random chance. The scene with Scotty beaming into the tubes while Kirk beamed safely outside was very funny! Trek fans may also take notice of the appearance of Captain Pike who was the original captain of the 1966 pilot episode and was later confined to that weird wheelchair-machine in which he could only communicate with two different colored beeps. Captain Pike is confined to a wheelchair later in the new film.<br /><br />As a common theme in other Star Trek films, there is a time-travel element in the new film. \\"ST-the Motion Picture\\" featured the 2oth Century satellite \\"Venus\\" as the main driving force of a massive spacecraft, \\"ST-the Voyage Home featured the retrieval of 20th century whales to communicate with a giant spacecraft (gasp!) and \\"ST-Generations\\" featured Captain Picard & Captain Kirk meeting each other face to face by some other weird time thing also.<br /><br />The new film is based on Romulans traveling from the future to the past seeking vengeance on Spock for failing to save their planet in the future. The legendary Leonard Nimoy makes a cameo appearance in the new film & we get an awkward moment when the old & new Spock appears together in the same scene. Overall I liked the new Star Trek very much as I feel it was very fast paced, plenty of action and the characters were great younger representations of the iconic crew from the 60's television series. For Trek fans there are a lot of references to past television or other film moments such as Kirk defeating (actually more like cheating) the training simulator for the \\"Kobayashi Maru\\" scenario that was mentioned in \\"ST-Wrath of Khan\\".<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />The two disc DVD features commentary by Director JJ Abrams, writers Robert Orci & Alex Kurtzman, producer Damon Lindelof and executive producer Bryan Burk on the feature film disc. There are also two featurettes which are \\"JJ Abrams - A New Vision\\" (19 minutes 31 seconds) and a gag reel of bloopers featuring the main cast (6 minutes 22 seconds). Most of the special features are on the second disc which also includes a digital copy of the film.<br /><br />The deleted scenes (with optional commentary) are; \\"Spock Birth\\", \\"Klingons take over Narada\\", \\"Young Kirk, Johnny & Uncle Frank\\", \\"Amanda & Sarek (Spock's parents) argue after Spock fights\\", \\"Prisoner interrogation & breakout\\", \\"Sarek gets Amanda\\", \\"Dorm room & Kobayashi Maru\\", \\"Kirk apologizes to the green girl\\" and \\"Sarek sees Spock\\". Overall, we get more scenes with Kirk & Spock as kids and the Klingon scene was suppose to reveal a key-subplot that the Kingons were more involved.<br /><br />Other featurettes on the second disc are; \\"To Boldly Go\\" (16 minutes 41 seconds)which mainly covers the director, writers & producers' challenges for creating Star Trek, \\"Casting\\" (28 minutes 53 seconds) as the cast talks about the essence of re-creating the original characters and this featurette ends with a Leonard Nimoy tribute, \\"Aliens\\" (16 minutes 29 seconds) as the designers talk about their designs for Romulans, Vulcans & other aliens and \\"Score\\" (6 minutes 28 seconds) which is about the musical score. The remaining special features are a PC DVD Rom link, \\"Star Trek DAC\\" Xbox 360 demo and a weblink to a free trial of the \\"Star Trek DAC\\" game for PC.<br /><br />For collector geeks like me, Target is offering a special two-disc DVD set with a Plastic USS Enterprise display model that houses both discs in the round saucer section. I posted pictures of my set above.as kids and the Klingon scene was suppose to reveal a key-subplot that the Kingons were more involved.

0061914177|5.0|Great book and fast delivery.  This book nails it! I always wondered how to create an \\"online presence\\" and this book tells me in detail. Easy read and lots of tips.
B002KECK1G|4.0|I ordered this because we wanted to see the first-ever production of the Orwell novel.  This is a great BBC production of the novel - the screenplay was written by Nigel Kneale (who did \\"Quatermass\\" for BBC).  Peter Cushing is, of course, wonderful.    HOWEVER:  when we received the disc, we noted that the frame grab photos on the back cover are from the 1956 film version of the novel starring Edmund O'Brien!  IGNORE THE GRABS - the film IS the BBC tv version with Peter Cushing.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Polar Express is a great movie for the Christmas season and all year long.  We love it and my granddaughter really enjoys it.  Our area even has an old train station which has \\"The Polar Express\\" event each year with riding the Christmas decorated train down the track to \\"the North Pole\\" and meeting Santa & Mrs. Santa.  Each person recieves the \\"bell\\", an ornament, and milk and cookies, of course.
B002P4VUMQ|4.0|I watched the dvd before I listened to the cd.   It just seemed to be missing something; the energy just didn't seem to be right.  (Interesting to note that he performs barefoot!)  I liked his previous cd much better.    The cd, however, is outstanding!!!  The energy level keeps going through all 16 songs.  It's funny how the same music, heard/seen in different formats, can be so different.

B002FOQY2W|5.0|This is an excellent album that I just happened to stumble on while browsing.  From the first line I was hooked.  I have listened to the opening track \\"Be Calm\\" I don't know how many times.  This is also an album that I can listen to from the opening track all the way through.  The music just flows and sticks with you all day long.  Highly Recommended!
B000002A46|5.0|This album is a masterpiece! Mariah Carey's voice was at its peak when she made this album and it is a must-have! Every note is excellent! I highly recommend it, especially to Mariah Carey lovers like myself.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|Don't even bother buying this CD.  Just got it today and it's CENSORED...specifically Bad Romance (one of my fav's too)...UUUGGGHHHH!!!  The ONLY reason I even purchased this CD was for the higher quality CD recording (CD vs mp3 signal-to-noise ratio is MUCH higher).  I really like LG, but WTF did they censor THIS album for?  Please tell me what's possibly worse than all the multiple \\"F\\" words in a rap song?  With what they did to this CD, you would certainly think that \\"biaaatch\\" was a far worse word.  Knock, knock...HELLO recording peeps....IT'S NOT!!!  The \\"B\\" word was replaced with \\"bit\\", which does not sound right AT ALL!!!  I will gar-ron-tee that if you heard the original, you will NOT like this totally lame rendition.  You'll be far better off with the single, or just rip it off some shareware network (lots of high bit-rate downloads of Bad Romance everywhere).  AGAIN....don't even bother buying this CD....
1567184855|5.0|I came to Amazon today to order Destiny of Souls because I was so blown away by Journey of Souls. Over the past 30 years I have read hundreds of books on spirituality, the paranormal, reincarnation, etc., and this one is unlike any other book I have read. It has truly changed my thinking and understanding of life. The case studies were very fascinating, but what was even more fascinating to me was the narrative Dr. Newton provided in each chapter. He answered many questions that have not been addressed in any other book I've read, and the explanations made perfect sense to me. Like many reviewers, the descriptions of the other side really rang true to me. I especially loved all the information about spirit guides. For me, the only thing missing in this book was discussion about souls who communicate with those of us on earth, and information about angels. I saw that these topics are covered in Destiny of Souls, so I am very excited to read that one! If you are a spiritual seeker trying to make sense of this life, then I highly recommend this book.
B00164CM46|4.0|Snatch is one of my all time favorite films.  He took the brilliant creativity and character development of Lock Stock and used a huge budget to make a dazzling film.  Too bad his magic was lost on subsequent films.  That notwithstanding, the Blu Ray is great.  Its a strong, but not huge, improvement over the original.  The video quality is very good, but much of Snatch was filmed in such a manner that aspects of the Blu Ray quality are unattainable (gritty scenes, overcast scenes (it is Britain), etc.).  However, I am impressed.  I would recommend, though, that you be a fairly devoted Snatch fan to justify upgrading your copy to Blu Ray.

B0013IKUIK|4.0|I read an interview of Bon Iver, in which the singer/songwriter told a story of a man in Iceland who wrote him a letter to tell the musician that when he first listened to [[ASIN:B0011HF6GE For Emma, Forever Ago]] he broke down in tears.<br /><br />One gander through this icy, melancholic, austere, and beautiful album and you understand the story above.<br /><br />Understand the story, but not so much the origin of the unknown man's tears - or, for that matter, your own. It is hard to listen to this album and not get sentimental. For this album lingers in the recesses of more complicated emotion, in between joy or depression, somewhere in the hazy, gray, middle area of melancholia or solitary bliss.<br /><br />This album leaves listeners more moved than pensive. Its lyrics are nonsensical, but brim over with meaning.<br /><br />This album is a stranger you pass at night along a rain-covered, cobblestone street in Vienna, who you swear you know from somewhere - but with no clue from where.
B000YAA68W|4.0|There has never been anything like \\"Persepolis\\" -- Marjane Satrapi's graphic adaptation of life during the Iranian revolution. The book's stark black and white images perfectly suited the horror of life under the Shah and the Ayatollahs. Could a movie adaptation ever do justice to the Satrapi's harrowing account? Thankfully, it pretty much did.<br /><br />The movie more or less follows the narrative of Satrapi's work, following her from an idealistic (and a bit sadistic!) young girl through her struggles with the repressive forces of the revolution, to her wastrel exile in Vienna, and to her return to her home country. The character list from the book is a drastically simplified, focusing mostly on Satrapi's beloved grandmother, an adored uncle who dies in prison and her protective and secularized parents. Satrapi's artistic style, one of the neat things about the book, was retained, but expanded enough to allow the film to breathe. This is a true adaptation -- not a slavish repetition of the book's style and themes. I only wish that it could have been be longer. Focusing on the entire story of Persepolis I and II might have been a mistake.<br /><br />A fine adaptation that I hope compels its audience to pick up the marvelous original!
0143038583|5.0|Pollan is able to put in a ton of important and often surprising information into his book, while making it very entertaining to read. I read it for a school assignment and couldn't put it down. He is journalist, not some stuffy scientist, so his approach to the topic of food is very entertaining and accessible to a layperson. A must-read for anyone who eats food they haven't grown themselves.
0385504225|5.0|This was a fast paced, exciting read. Another great book by Dan Brown.  He knows how to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|This is a very underrated and terrific movie.  The cinematography and special effects and top notch, the casting and acting very good and the suspense palpable.  I can't believe this film slipped under the wire in the US last year.  I had never even heard of it prior to renting.  Highly recommended - especially in Blu-Ray.

B001UW58WW|5.0|I found out about David just a couple of weeks ago after watching a couple of videos on Youtube. After watching his performance of Czardas by Monti and listening to his \\"classical\\" version of Smooth Criminal by Michael Jackson I fell in love with his music and had to buy the cd right away.     This Album is an exquisite selection of classical and contemporary music adapted to violin and played in the very particular style of David Garrett along with electric guitars, drums and other modern intruments.     My favorites pieces from this album are:    Czardas  Who Wants to live Forever?  Smooth Criminal  Carmen  Summer (Third Movement)
0743216385|5.0|typical for steve ambrose stuff! heavily researched, very accurate, expertly written in a captivating manner. the most striking thing for me, and my family, is the way he described my uncle's death. Andrew F. Hill, chief warrent officer, 101 airborne, headquarters co. we have the usual letter from the army describing uncle Andy's exploits up until he bought the farm. of all the thousands of Americans who gave it all during that war, and here is this info about one individual. wow... the entire book is awesome. highly reccommend this to any wwII buff
B001TK3XPE|1.0|I disagree with the reviewers who loved this novel; in my view, this novel is trite, self-pitying, and emotionally atrophied. It is hard to believe that the writer of so many good novels, especially the rip-roaring \\"Nice Work,\\" would submit such a sentimental and shallow novel for publication.   There is one captivating passage in the novel and that is Beethoven's letter, discovered after his death, in which he apologizes for his anti-social behavior: \\"It was impossible for me to say to people,\\" Beethoven laments, \\"'Speak louder, shout, for I am deaf.' Ah, how could I possibly admit to an infirmity in the one sense which ought to be more perfect in me than in others, a sense which I once possessed in the highest perfection...Oh, I cannot do it, therefore forgive me when you see me draw back when I would gladly have mingled with you.\\" Such misery often drove Beethoven, he admits,  to thoughts of ending his life, but \\"it seemed to me impossible to leave the world until I had brought forth all that I felt was within me.'\\"   I am grateful to Lodge for quoting this passage, but my hopes that Lodge himself would be uplifted by such a moving testament to the tenacity and power of Beethoven's spirit were soon dashed. \\"What comfort can I draw from these case histories?\\" Lodge asks. \\"Not much. Both men [Beethoven and Goya] happened to be geniuses and found some kind of compensation for their affliction in their art. I'm neither a genius nor an artist.\\" He is not an artist--but he does write. He is not a genius--neither am I and most people in the world. So why is Beethoven's letter so moving? Because it shows how--against outrageous odds--Beethoven managed to complete his vision and assert his life's meaning. We all struggle--it's the way we deal with these struggles that defines us. And the way Lodge deals with his struggle with deafness is by attempting--repeatedly-- to find a comfortable way out of pain. He can't find \\"comfort\\" in Beethoven's testimony and he becomes \\"uncomfortable\\" when he reads a student's thesis on suicide notes. The words \\"uncomfortable\\" and \\"depressing\\" are key words in the novel, signifying Lodge's retreat from plunging into the depth of the important human problems he presents to us. Here is an example of his thoughts on the approaching death of his father: \\"It was depressing to reflect that I would probably never have a proper conversation with my father again...\\" In addition to the vagueness and emptiness of the word \\"depressing,\\" there is the fact, that has been shown to us time and again, that Lodge never had a \\"proper conversation\\" with his father. This is just a comforting lie. Throughout the novel, it is a plain fact that the father cannot or would not communicate \\"properly\\" with his son. The son is hostile toward the father, but he never stands up to his ridiculous demands. Of course, we should admire Desmond's sense of duty, but a bit of honesty here, and in other places, would  go a long way toward finding some \\"comfort\\" in Beethoven's letter.   So Lodge's Desmond wanders through the house (and the novel) in his slippers, looking--not for meaningful   insights--but for comfort.  It is a wonder, then, that on his trip to Poland, Desmond decides to visit Auschwitz. Unsurprisingly, though, his response to the concentration camp is as atrophied as are the rest of his emotional responses throughout the novel: \\"One feels pity of course, and sorrow, and anger, but these feelings seem as superfluous to the immensity of woe this place evokes as tears dropped into an ocean.\\" Not his tears, though, as he admits, for he does \\"not weep readily.\\" (Not even for Auschwitz, Desmond?) It is rather amazing how this man wiggles out of feeling anything at all! \\"One feels\\"--not \\"I feel\\"--and then a list of abstract nouns, and then the clumsy admission that he is not quick to cry. And if he were, I certainly wouldn't want to read about it. Later he talks on the phone to his wife and tells her that he visited Auschwitz. Here's her response and some of their conversation: \\"'Did you?' She sounded surprised...'Was it awful?' 'It was unforgettable,' I said. 'I'll tell you about it when I get home.' 'Yes, do, darling, not now,' she said. 'Let's not spoil the birth of your first grandchild with such a gloomy topic.'\\" Of course not, darling! Let's not spoil our comfortable lives with this \\"awful\\" Auschwitz!   This novel is shameless, narcissistic, and boring. Very boring.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Brings tears to my eyes.  Why is this musical art by Susan Boyle so beautiful?--because hers is the voice of an absolutely egoless soul from the heavens.  In a world of self-absorbed, narcissistic industry money-makers in the music business, Susan Boyle is as rare as blue diamonds.  She's the real thing.    We, the masses, love Susan Boyle so much because she is one of us who made it big--and her stunning voice is absolutely breathtaking.  Time stops when she sings.  Susan clings to every word and note of this amazing CD.  She throws away not one word, not one note.  Every utterance is Divine.  You can hear her life in every line of the poetry, and you know all the songs have deep meaning for her because she makes you FEEL it with her.  She pulls you into the paintings of her songs and you feel yourself surrounded by the brilliant colors of her heart, and her life.    Susan herself is a magnificent source of hope to all the rest of us.  She offered her dream to the universe, saw herself in it, and had the willingness to take that first step into light.  That is a moment we all dream to live.  Susan took everyone of us with her into her dream.  She dreams and so do we.  She stepped into hers...and so can we.    I will be listening to Susan Boyle when I step into mine.    Susan--you are my new favorite artist.  I will be your fan for the rest of my days.    And to anyone reading this review:   BUY THIS CD!  YOU'LL BE SO GLAD YOU DID!

B002T45VX6|1.0|Not what was I expecting from her!  I listened to this cd while I was in College. I was so disappointed because its very danceable but it isn't what I was expecting from her. It just seems like she's trying to sell and become popular.

0688145078|5.0|Perfect book for a big brother in training!  I can't wait to give it as a gift.
0810983915|5.0|For the longest time I have been trying to get my then 11 year old brother to read something other than manga. I tried going to different libraries, pulling out some of my old favorites, and looking up the books for his age group all to no avail. He actually stumbled on this series himself. And when he came home he was so excited that he decided to not only read it but to set time aside so that we could read it together. Every time a Diary of a Wimpy Kid book came out I was the first one in the book store. It's a cute story and most of all it has more words than pictures.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|im addicted to drama and i love this series. i waited until they all came out and bought the whole thing. this was by far the best buy
B002SEV384|5.0|I´ve seen the dvd in a japaneese copy and i think it´s great quality. I disagree with the first review posted. There´s no problem about editing it, as the other reviewer complained, because they had a stunning performance and included great songs at the dvd. They couldn´t have put all the songs. Of course, always someone will prefer this or that song, but they put a lot of classics like Dry county, i´ll be there for you (with sambora on the vocals. The songs are not in the order that they were performed? so what???? It doesn´t matter.    Great live DVD. Entertainment guaranteed!!! This is reall bon jovi, not that last dvd release called \\"this left feels right\\". That was garbage... This new live concert is awesome!    I assure that every bon jovi fan will adore the release.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The product turned out to be great. I am happy with the arrival and condition of the product.
B000HGA5PM|4.0|This was a very well orchestrated show which was probably supposed to have been included in the \\"The Wall Movie\\", however the director was a flake and hurried with out the input from Roger Waters.  Even to todays standards this performance was excellent as well as the props and stage hands meeting with quite a set.         My only problem was the quality of the sound which was not in stereo mode.  For some reason the internet \\"Goog Video\\" has the first half of this same concert with good sound contrary to the DVD.         All in all I would strongly urge any real Floyd fan to see this concert.  -John  DC
0060760273|4.0|The book has pictures in both color and black&white. Hence its meant for babies in their early days and lil later. The rhythmic sound of words makes my son jump with joy. This is my baby's first book and I'd say the book is worth it. But pairing the book with the lil toy isn't good for money. The stuffed toy is very small in size (would easily fit in your palm). You can buy just the book (board) for half this price.
B0026P3G12|2.0|I expected more challenging vocals, more volume and a more consistent mix of songs.  I am sorry to be disappointed.<br />I think she should do an album of all religious music...so much on this one seemed odd.  I don't mind the occasional religious song, but 3?  And Amazing Grace?  It's an overused, vapid, insipid song.  I hoped she'd make it likable to me, but no joy.<br />An all Christmas album would be a good project for her.
0380730405|3.0|Rebecca tells the story of Mandalay, a house in the English countryside that is haunted by the memory of Rebecca, Maxim De Winter's first wife.  Maxim has remarried yet neither he nor anyone he knows can forget the beautiful and alluring Rebecca.  This makes life almost unbearable for Maxim's new wife.  The most interesting aspect of this book is that the main character, the second Mrs De Winter, has no name.  Given that the story is told from her perspective there is really no need to have one.<br /><br />The book was most famously adapted for the big screen by Alfred Hitchcock in 1940.  Anyone can see why.  This book has all characteristics of a classic Hitchcock film - an innocent in peril, a frustrated love, a creepy villain and a sense of something sinister lurking just beneath the surface.  The novel is set in the 1930s and much of the story's twists and turns owe their plausibility to that era.  Without giving too much away, many of the plotlines would have turned out differently had forensic evidence been available at that time.  I enjoyed this book primarily because of the quality of the writing - it is first rate.  Rebecca is an excellent read.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Picking up where the first season left off, The Sons of Anarchy are in turmoil. The ATF is still on their backs. The gun business has dried up. The gang is divided. Jax Teller remains at the center of this division. He knows his stepfather and President,Clay is responsible for the death of a SAMCRO member's wife, but Jax must decide whether to put his club's, his family's or his friend's interests first. The conflict doesn't stop with Jax. Division is a central theme of Season Two. Each character struggles with his/her own internal issues. Clay must decide how to best handle a son he loves but who has begun to question his authority, at every turn.
1594489505|4.0|Another impressive book by Khaled Hosseini about life in Afghanistan but this time about the plight of women under the rule of the Taliban.  The two main characters are Marian (an illegitimate girl) who is forced to marry a brutal shoemaker; and Laila who is raised by a modern family yet still ends up as the second wife of the vicious shoemaker.  The shoemaker, by the way, is a Taliban follower.<br /><br />There are many well described aspects which surround the story: familial roles, household chores division, raising children, religion and more.  The author tries to accentuate the harshness that some women have in their life and that no matter what they'll do, they'll never get ahead because of how they grew up and /or who they were born to.<br /><br />I also found it interesting that Mr. Hosseini wrote how the Taliban followers justify their oppression of women, which is a perspective which helps the men explain to themselves why they are allowed to treat women like dirt - and hence be able to look in the mirror.<br /><br />\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is not as good or disturbing as \\"The Kite Runner\\" but still well worth reading, however these are two different books and the comparison is unwarranted.
B000002GBB|4.0|A classic. \\"Blue Collar Man\\" and \\"Renegade\\" were top 40 hits. I still think they are some of the best they put out.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Some will probably condemn this movie, but I enjoyed it.  It is silly and fun, a guilty pleasure.  Lots of singing and dancing, and new interpretations of ABBA songs.  Dozens of music and dance scenes were packed into one movie. I was amazed any time was left for a plot, but yes, there was a plot, and it was not entirely predictable.  Colorful sets and costumes.  High-energy music/dance scenes, some of which involved a surprisingly large crowd of performers.
B0012GN3RI|3.0|I had trouble getting into this one. Only one time thru so far. It doesn't compare to \\"Narita\\" which I thoroughly enjoy.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|When it has came down to Pop Music, there have been artists that have been honestly never forgotten, as the cornerstones of the pop music landscape. While we've lost some of those acts, like the tragic death of Michael Jackson back in June, what we should and truthfully remember is how great and influential their songs have been over the years. That also has been strongly reminded back in Sptember with The Beatles. With all of their classic records being remastered for the first time ever, and with their music being the focus behind their own Rock Band video game, there honestly has been no denying the constant they've still maintained since they cam on the Ed Sullivan Show 45 years ago. But while there are so many who own all of their classic records, there hasn't been many a definitive reflection of what has made The Beatles such a constant, and here it is.<br /><br />1 By The Beatles, their 2000 Greatest Hits album, is truthfully the strongest and most detailed greatest hits package that definitely reflects on almost all of The Beatles classic pop catalog from all the years they've made the best in pop music, in one comprehensive hits package. The songs have all been strongly remastered, and include a lot of their biggest and most influential songs including Love Me Do, Hey Jude, the somber Let It Be, Get Back and the soulful The Long & Winding Road. There also are some lesser-known songs here that are surprising like The Ballad of John & Yoko, Day Tripper and Eight Days A Week, that actually sound better than all the years they've been out on their original albums for so long. Yet with all the songs on the album, I honestly though wish there could've been a few of their more widely showcased songs like Sgt. Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band, and I Am The Walrus on the collection as well.<br /><br />Overall, despite a few overshadowed songs, The Beatles 1 is definitely the strongest reflection of what made John, Paul, George & Ringo so strong with melodicmemories after all these years. If you have not even yet owned a Beatles album in your music library, than I would honestly recommend that you start right here with 1, as the simplest way of hearing why The Fab Four have never gone away, even though they ended years ago. It is honestly one of the few must have greatest hits records that I really have recommended that sounds so surprisingly strong today.<br /><br />Album Cover: A<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: A-<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+years.

045122499X|5.0|I read Pillars of the Earth, and although this book contains many similarities to it's prequel, I think the story was just as good, and the characters were just as lovable/loathesome.  I started becoming super enthralled by the middle of the book, but the time you put in to get through the beginning is well worth it. This book contained a lot of information about so many different themes- history, medicine, feminism, religion, etc. and was a great story about love, hate, revenge, and betrayal. I absolutely loved it and am sad that it is over.

So why am I punished because of where I live? I'm sure it makes sense somewhere...    Anyway great product great movie great delivery! As long as you live in America.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|As someone who attended Michael's U.S. concerts over the last 25 years (Jacksons Victory Tour and Michael's Bad Tour), I was not surprised by the great performance Michael gave in Bucharest back during this early 90's tour.  I purchased this dvd because after the Bad Tour, Michael's tours were outside of the U.S., so I wanted to see what fans in other parts of the world got to see.  As with most Motown-trained artists, Michael always put on top notch shows full of real singing, both precise and free-style dance moves unique to Michael, theatrics and great showmanship. What's always amazing is the high, never-ending energy with no intermissions.  Michael always gave audiences their money's worth- usually at least 2 hours of performance with few long breaks or wardrobe changes common to other artists' shows.  I am a bit biased, but I give this one 5 stars!
B001B1876G|1.0|What a waste of blu ray space. The story itself is garbage, it's so boring i was falling asleep and i Do NOT fall asleep when i watch my movies. Animation is drawn well but that is no excuse for how boring it is.
0385341008|1.0|I can not believe all these people liked this book. I am an avid reader and I feel as if I just finished reading a children's book. What unrealistic characters and a plot that goes no where. The only good/interesting part of the book was learning more about what happened on Guernsey during WWII. I did finish this book, but I feel I wasted time doing so when I could have been reading a \\"real\\" book.

B001AVCFJM|3.0|I am longtime fan of \\"Star Trek,\\" especially of the original series, which I watched in syndication growing up, before there were any movies or follow on series - in other words before there even was a \\"franchise.\\"  When I first saw \\"Star Trek,\\" it wasn't the _original series_, it was the _only_ series.  It was the entirety of \\"Star Trek,\\" and I loved it.  I enjoyed the sequel series, but never as much as the original show.  So it was with a great deal of anticipation, but also some anxiety that I met the prospect of a reboot of such a beloved part of my childhood.  Done well, I knew it could be fantastic, and reinvigorate the \\"Star Trek\\" name; done badly, and it would take a franchise already flagging badly and possibly put a stake through its heart.<br /><br />Well, having seen the result, I can say that they didn't do too badly, but they definitely didn't knock it out of the park like Christopher Nolan did with the Batman franchise.  J.J. Abrams and co. managed to tell a decent story, to pace it quite well, employed stunts and special effects skillfully, but didn't overdo them (a common failing these days), pit a credible and compelling villain against the heroes, and by using Leonard Nimoy as a Spock traveled back from the future and altered the history of the original series characters when they were young, they managed to tie the movie in with the series, and at the same time free themselves up to take things in new and unexplored directions.  The actors were all superbly cast, and did outstanding jobs, which reflects especially well on them, given the challenge of playing such familiar and beloved characters.  Abrams and co. also managed to make a Trek film that was actually fun to watch for the first time in a very long time.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and look forward to seeing what they can do in the sequels.  With all that said, however, there are a couple of things about this movie that strike me as terrible flaws and weaknesses, and which keep the movie from being as good as the original series at its best, or the best of the films like \\"Star Trek II\\" and \\"Star Trek VI\\".<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the movie is the characterization of James T. Kirk.  I think Chris Pine did a marvelous job, and I think he's the perfect actor for the role.  Without ever trying to imitate William Shatner's trademark speech cadence and mannerisms, he manages to portray the basic aspects of Kirk's character -- his drive, his sheer ability, his instinct for the right course of action, and his humor - superbly.  The problem's with Kirk in this movie come not from Pine's performance, but rather from the role as it was written for him.  The writers wrote several scenes fleshing out Kirk's history, clearly intending to show the audience what a daring young maverick he was, but had the effect of making him look like a feckless, selfish, manipulative jerk (this is made even worse in the deleted scenes).  In Hollywood, they love to establish characters with scenes showing them displaying certain traits to the maximum extent possible.  They establish Kirk (a very young Kirk) as the aggressive, devil-may-care, risk-taking adventurer with the scene of him stealing his uncle's classic Corvette Stingray and driving it over a cliff, bailing out and saving himself from the plunge at the last possible instant.  This is, unfortunately, the tired old clich&eacute; of \\"the reckless hothead, who is so supercharged with testosterone that he finds himself constantly in trouble, but who is also just the ultimate bad@$$, and therefore, of course, a natural, born leader, destined to rise to greatness.\\"  This stereotype is an old one, and this scene, as well as a couple that follow, like a bar fight an older Kirk gets into, absolutely reek of clich&eacute;.  The problem is that Hollywood does not seem able to distinguish between the qualities of \\"courage\\" and \\"reckless stupidity\\".  A true born leader also displays judgment, self control, and nerve,not just reckless daring.  A 13 or 14 year old kid speeding down the road in a stolen 1963 Corvette convertible (in the 23rd century presumably a priceless antique) that he deliberately destroys, and a twenty-something young man who picks a bar fight with four guys because he's got too much ego and aggression to back down, is an example of an idiot who will probably spend a lifetime in and out of prison because he can't control his impulses or weigh the consequences of his actions, not someone who will eventually end up being a responsible leader.<br /><br />The second great flaw in the movie is that it feels way, way too forced.  In \\"Star Trek\\" Kirk is captain, Spock is first officer, Bones is the ship's doctor, Scotty is chief engineer, etc., so that's the way it has to be by the end of the picture - regardless of whether or not that outcome makes any sense, given where the characters started at the beginning of the film.  In the series, occasionally they referred to the history of these characters: in one episode, we see that Spock had served under Pike, the Enterprise's previous captain (and the Enterprise is also just one of several ships in its class, and is far from new), in another, they referred to Kirk's time as a junior officer on another starship, etc..  It was made clear that every member of the crew came to his current station the logical way, by the normal process of career advancement.  Sure Kirk's young for the commander of one of Starfleet's best capital ships, which demonstrates what a natural leader he is, but he still had to come up through the ranks like any other officer; he just did it a bit faster than most because of his talent.  In this movie, when Kirk first steps aboard the Enterprise, he's a _cadet_.  He hasn't even graduated the academy yet.  By the end of it, he's the _captain_ of Starfleet's newest, most advanced, most powerful ship.  How is this possible?  Why does Pike make him first officer in the first place?  On a ship this size there must be dozens of more experienced, more qualified officers in line ahead of Cadet Kirk.  Even if some disaster wiped out every other senior officer ahead of him, what navy ever existed that would allow a kid with no experience whatsoever, and a background full of alarming examples of his contempt for authority (indeed, he was under suspension for one at the very moment he stowed away - yes, stowed away, rather than being assigned) to retain permanent command of its most powerful vessel?  This is just so incredible that it blasts a hole in suspension of belief big enough to fly the Enterprise itself through.  It also has the effect of making the whole thing feel very, very contrived, very forced - a desperate effort to get the familiar characters into their familiar roles, by hook or by crook.<br /><br />These two flaws are severe ones, and hurt an otherwise fine film, preventing it from reaching the level of quality and artistic merit it might otherwise have.  As a result, the movie ends up being no better than decent popcorn fare - still very entertaining, and fun to watch, but not really great.  I hope they can do better with the sequels.A 13 or 14 year old kid speeding down the road in a stolen 1963 Corvette convertible (in the 23rd century presumably a priceless antique) that he deliberately destroys, and a twenty-something young man who picks a bar fight with four guys because he's got too much ego and aggression to back down, is an example of an idiot who will probably spend a lifetime in and out of prison because he can't control his impulses or weigh the consequences of his actions, not someone who will eventually end up being a responsible leader.

B001AVCFK6|2.0|I enjoyed the movie when I saw it in the theater.  Sure it has some things that jarred me out of my engrossed stupor, but it was a good movie.  The reason for the low rating is based on the product.  I'm not even remotely interested in two extra disks of stuff I'll never watch.  And there is no Star Trek blur ray single disk option listed anywhere I can find.  I hope decision makers for producing these products read plenty of comments like this one.  A cheaper single disk product is what some of us prefer.
0385504225|2.0|I liked The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons........but The Lost Symbol was The Lost Interest in Dan Brown for me.  I had to force myself to finish the book.  It was NOT a pager-turner it was a page too-many.  What was the point?  That Washington was basically built as a city to Praise God or The Word with all the ancient wisdom is the Bible.  It was so heavy-handed on the symbol/jumbo and the Masonic lore/ideals that I thought it was verging on a New Age religious tract.  Blah!
B002SYXCVK|5.0|Not much that hasn't been said, but you should know that you may find yourself playing this great album over and over and over again. Saw the PBS performance and immediately came here to download the mp3 files. Now I can't stop playing this! Great musicianship enhanced by Sting's husky, aging rocker voice- even when he can't quite reach some of the very low notes. My faves are Soul Cake, Hurdy Gurdy Man, and Gabriel's Message but the whole album is special. And no, I've never been a Sting fan- previously.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was afraid I wouldn't like this cd because it's not really the type of music I like.  Country, rap and alternative are my favorite genres and probably in that order.  I am so glad I took the time to listen to this cd because I found out that my initial thoughts were wrong!  My favorite is probably How Great Thou Art or Wild Horses.  I think Susan could sing anything and make it sound great.  I am glad her cd sold as many copies as it did.
0920668364|1.0|We were given this book as a gift and find it disturbing. It came in a cardboard box/sleeve, which our son loved, so we sometimes read it to him, but we always added a lot of commentary. The mom in this book is creepy! She drives across town with a ladder strapped to her car roof to invade her son's privacy. This is just wrong and crazy! I'd give it zero stars if that were an option.

B001MS7IBS|4.0|I enjoy the show quite a lot but season 2 is dragging its shoes very badly.     Relating to season 1...    It is exactly like watching the anime tv show ghost in the shell stand alone complex.....wherein i remember that one show was about the main storyline then a show about something completely different but involving the main cast then a show about the storyline then a few more shows about something else until the season was ended and the real plot had been resolved following that formula.    Fringe is following the same darn pattern this year...last year we had a lot of info coming in about the pattern, massive dynamics and so on and so forth but this year is about CSI but with a supernatural twist...we are not learning anything. A lot of super interesting character development but that is about it.    There is so long that people will endure to see that the main plot does not go forward and eventually ratings will start to go down because people will get tired of seeing the show dragging it's feet. If they only have one major plot to work on then the show is done for...JJ Abrams needs to move this plot forward end it and then start a new concept a new threat towards the world that the fringe division can work on. I know more info is supposed to come in future episodes  but i don't think i want to see 5 or 6 more fillers shows and only see one show in the end that move the plot forward or set up the show for the next season.     Does anyone agree?
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have always LOVED Jillian, I am a huge TBL fan, so I thought I would give her DVD a try. I have recently hit 100 lbs lost, & I needed something to help tone & get the last 15-20 lbs off. I started this 3 days ago, and my legs definitely know it! I do cardio 5 days a week, 5.5 miles on my spin bike every morning, and this DVD still KICKED MY BUTT! The constant switching & never stopping make it fun, & it goes by pretty fast. It is a challenge though, I am still doing level 1, & I break an awesome sweat. If you can't hang, you can do the modified steps, & Jillian doesn't make you feel bad about it. I was not disappointed at all, it is everything I wanted it to be!
0882709194|1.0|First off, please choose a different version...  Here is why: in the \\"special introduction\\" the author, Ray Comfort, decides to take it upon himself to appraise Christianity in a book that presents another theory. He does not want to be open minded in that he spends a lot of time in going through how Darwin's views don't match those of Christianity. On top of that, he bashes all other religions! He goes through four of the major ones (Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam) and basically discredits them. he states how these a faulty and cannot help you; only Christianity can. This is a book stating scientific theories and should not be turned into a religious debate. Can we not make a decision without having another force his ideas upon us? Is that too much to ask for??  Second reason for choosing another version...  The original version of this work is as heavy as a brick and twice as big (a version that I saw). Imagine if you will, a about 2 inch book (around 490+ pages) has been condensed into less than 270 pages. How is this possible you ask? Well, naturally you change the print to about font of 6 or 7 (except for the special intro that is the regular 12 for some reason) so no one could read it or will go blind in the attempt.   If the ratings don't show it please read all the reviews and compare the reasons of the ones that like it and those that don't. I didn't waste my money mainly because I was given this for free... don't waste yours; buy one that is neutral in the religious field and states only what Darwin's idea was. That is what I assume is the reason you were looking at a book with this title.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I rarely write reviews here, but had to vent on this one. I love Lady Gaga's The Fame album, so after reading the reviews on here, I was excited about getting The Fame Monster.  I wish I hadn't :(  The 8 songs on here sound like Gaga had them in the closet for the past 5 years and threw them together to sell more albums.  It doesn't seem as if any real effort went into writing them. Kylie Minogue does the same type of sound as this album, only 10 times better. I was really hoping for better.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The Lost Symbol is a fun read - typical Dan Brown.  Assuming you've read Brown's other books, this one is no different in that the story grabs you from the beginning and quickly has you turning page, after page, after page.  What's always enjoyable is Brown's way of weaving truth and fiction together and this book has plenty of this.  Personally, and despite that I'm absolutely not an historian, it's easy to let your imagination wander with the imagery in the Lost Symbol.  The level of detail and reference to actual high profile landmarks is one of the most exciting elements of this book.<br /><br />I will say at times the book does get a bit slow but that should be expected with any good piece of entertainment - it will have highs and lows.  Towards the end of the book, a few good surprises are thrown at you which you may or may not see coming - I definitely did not.<br /><br />I truly didn't have any expectations coming into the book which I think was beneficial.  As often happens, when you have high (or low) expectations, they always never seem to live up to that standard.  Overall though, the book has all of the right elements, the characters are, as usual, fascinating and developed and the plot is palatable.  I gave it four stars because I liked the book, as three stars is \\"just ok\\" (at least according to Amazon standards).<br /><br />Keep an open mind as with any Dan Brown book, let your imagination run and you'll enjoy the piece.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought Susan's CD because of her signature performance. As a professional musician who has sat in a recording studio myself, I was stunned at how well she has done in her FIRST \\"album\\". People can criticize her all they want, nit-pick but I know how jealous \\"professionals\\" are of who come out of nowhere like Susan. They do make some good points about \\"rushing\\" and some of her phrasing is on rare occasion awkward.  It's her first album for heavens sake!  I look forward to her next album to hear her progress.    I really like her soft-jazz style the best in \\"Cry Me a River\\", I want more.  Susan is such an inspiration. I think she should be sing the theme song to the next James Bond movie, if she will stoop that low.  I look forward to an auto-bi-ography of her life and new career. I hope that our own big dreams come true as they have for Susan!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Porco Rosso maybe something completely different from Miyazaki, but it is very well executed. It is just as much of a masterpiece as Spirited Away. Porco Rosso is full of humor, cleverly hidden jokes, and sports a very well written story line. It is a pleasure to watch and a movie I would highly recommend to anyone, even those who have never seen a Studio Ghibli film. As my number three favorite movie of all time, I believe the movie is worth every cent and is one of very few movies I could watch in a loop for hours. If you are looking for a great movie to add to your collection, you've found it.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|This show is so fun to watch. I started out watching a few episodes whenever I just happened to catch it on television. Soon I was looking forward to it every week. People who are fans of the book may not be happy with the choices of the characters or story, but for someone who has never read or even heard of the books, these characters are terrific. Richard is the seeker and he has been chosen to be the seeker because every generation or so, when evil in the land is at its peak, a seeker comes along to free everyone from the evil that rules the land. It is a sort of checks and balances system that people of this time live by. Well, Richard is the chosen one and he must battle evil, with the help of the confessor, Kahlan, and the wizard, Zed.      As this second season gets underway, I can see that this is going to be a series that can go as long as the writing stays strong. So far, so good. If you are a fan of the medieval time period, wizards, warriors, and magic, you will enjoy this entertaining program that's fun for the entire family.
B002TO1Z8Q|4.0|You could definitely say there were some 'exepectations' about this first -and if we have to believe George, his only- full live show that George puts out in his career. And does he deliver? Yes he does. The songs are great, the visuals on stage are incredible and the voice is good. Just good? Well, there was a time that no one could beat Georges voice. In the early nineties it was no coincedence he had 2 worldwide no. 1 hits with live recordings (Somebody To Love with Queen and Don't Let The Sun.. with Elton). George díd loose some of the magic in his voice in the roaring 17 years that followed. But between the always catchy and joyously performed uptempo tracks like 'I'm Your Man' and 'Too Funky' there are still flashes of the genius singer he can be, like in 'A Different Corner' and the more recent, very touching 'My Mother Had A Brother'. And for those who find 23 songs without guests or solo's by musicians a bit much of the same, there's is a nice documentary on disc 2 that shows sides of George we don't get to see much. A dedicated performer and perfectionist who seems to do this more for his fans than for himself, and the kind, very Britisch guy who seems to have actually almost got over 17 years of troubled life.

B00070Q8DQ|4.0|Demigod being Behemoth's 7th studio album and their 2004 releases showcases some of the best blackened death metal that I have heard in a long time. The guitar riffs are insanley heavy, and the singing is dark, deep and powerfull. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with a lot of photographs of the band and a list of whom plays what on the album. We also get a list of companies that they like for instance Dean Guitars. This reminds me alot of Skinny Puppy in how they mix theatrics and music. Allmusic gave the album 4/5 and I agree with them. 4/5.
1401394191|5.0|The author is also the narrator in the audio version of this book. I found that to be an added bonus because he does a very, very good job. This is an excellent story to accompany you on a 5-6 hour car trip. Have a Little Faith is an uplifting story that also happens to be true. It is a story about faith, but it doesn't get too religious. People of all beliefs will benefit from this story. It begins with the author struggling with the idea of giving a eulogy when asked to do so by his rabbi. Mitch's method of getting to know his rabbi better is truly wonderful - there are comical and tearful moments. There is also a secondary story that intertwines with the first. That involves an unlikely pastor of a poor inner-city parish who is doing God's mission in a very unselfish and faithful way.

B0026P3G12|4.0|I love Susan Boyle's voice and the songs on her CD, \\"I Dream a Dream\\", are a great selection. However, The music on the CD was over-powering, drowning out her beautiful voice on many of the songs. On her next CD, I urge the Sound Engineer to tone down the music and let Susan's clear and beautiful voice come through. ON her next CD, I hope she will sing \\"Wind beneath My Wings\\" & \\"God is Watching Us\\".
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I have been a Sting fan since the late 70's and faithfully supported his work over the years attending concerts and purchasing his recordings.      This album is a dismal failure and unworthy of the genre being attempted.       A previous review commented that \\"the tone and vocal style of this album are clearly connected to Sting's \\"Songs from the Labyrinth,\\".  A poor defense given that that album was equally as poor musically (on Sting's part) and historically misguided.     Never mind not being a good \\"Christmas Album\\"....it is not even a good \\"Winter Album\\".  I have spent 17 years (and earned three degrees) performing and studying \\"early\\" vocal/instrumental performance practices and techniques...this album is so wide of the mark it makes Mick Jagger and/or Rod Stewart look like accomplished musicologists.      A \\"Rustic vibrancy enveloped in a haunting winter fog\\" (?!?! - previous review)...better said would be \\"an uncontrollable warble in a frightening \\"purple haze\\"!      Great musicians...poorly executed.     Great concept...poorly conceived.     We love you Sting! Retire with grace and let us enjoy the musical \\"gems\\" that you have already left us.     Please...don't write a 10th symphony!!!
B001FB55HQ|4.0|Gads! All the whining!    \\"Terminator: Salvation\\" did what it was supposed to do. ENTERTAIN! So the Blu-Ray edition had a director's cut, so the DVD didn't have extras. So all the folk who saw it at the theaters were stupid?    \\"Terminator: Salvation\\" is first and foremost, a Sci-Fi film (which means that it most likely will play fast and loose with things like physics, technical jargon, weapons with an unlimited supply of ammunition, among others. All three of the previous films of the franchise did the same thing (but it didn't stop any of the grousers from seeing it, anyway).    The story is only a snippet of the story of John Connor, meaning the franchise has a looooong way to go yet. I happen to like the \\"new\\" terminators (and there were a bunch!) introduced, and the pace was lightning quick, meaning I had to watch certain segments over, to get full effect. Yes, the acting was two-dimensional at times, but this is a Sci-Fi/Action film, and considering Schwartzeneggar's portrayals in the first three films, not unexpected. Still, the film doesn't suffer because of this. The story is still engrossing for those devotees of the franchise.    It's funny that with the exception of Christian Bale, the better known actors like Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Ironside and Jane Alexander were relegated to what were essentially bit parts. It's sad, too, because Jane Alexander is such a wonderful actress! The rest are relative unknowns, with maybe Anton Yelchin (Alpha Dog) and Bryce Dallas Howard being notable exceptions. Still, the performances were good.    I won't go into specific details of the story, as there are many here who just had to jump on their computer to get their reviews in FAST, so as to lay it bare, thinking they were doing us all a favor. Suffice to say, \\"Terminator:Salvation\\" is as good a Sci-Fi/Action film as you are likely to see, until maybe....\\"Avatar\\".
B00002N9ER|5.0|The contact is tight and I can see how the bracket would break over time.. For me however, the flash lights are being stored in a cupboard and only used in emergencies. I have only needed to remove the light twice and both times I was careful taking it out and back in.      I am not sure I would recommend these for everyday use.    Also, I only used 1 clip per light. It is sturdy enough that you do not need both.    For me, they were perfect for my requirements.
B000BB14YY|5.0|\\"Ran\\" takes its time to engage the audience.   Approach this as you would an afternoon in a Greek amphiteatre overlooking the Aegean.   Thunderclouds threaten.  You may get rained on.   But by nightfall, you have lived through an unforgettable experience.    The experience includes a display of color that will haunt your mind forever.  It also includes perhaps the most overwhelming film score since Prokofiev's \\"Alexander Nevsky.\\"    As for Shakespeare, he's probably o.k. with this.   Paul Scofield and Peter Brook this is not, but what it is belongs next to their \\"King Lear\\" in anybody's collection of great adaptations.
B002N5N5QQ|4.0|Kurt Sutter, creator of \\"Sons of Anarchy,\\" has done a fine job developing the series.  Things ratchet up with the feds, Hale (the honest police officer), the Irish and the individuals within SAMCRO, not to mention the Aryans who move into town to stir everything up.<br /><br />Charlie Hunnam has grown into the character of Jax and made him more believable and human/likeable.  I know I got a few dings from Jax worshippers (all women) in my review for Season 1, but I found him and his relationship with Maggie Siff's character to be the weakest aspects.  With the developments in Season 2, all my doubts are dispelled and there are tremendous amounts of growth in the storyline and the town of Charming's denizens.  Great guest stars include: Tom Arnold; Adam Arkin; Titus Welliver; Henry Rollins; Mitch Pileggi; and, of course, Ally Walker of \\"Profiler\\" fame.<br /><br />My only issue is that there isn't more interaction between SAMCRO members and the townspeople.  Supposedly, these guys are generally well-liked by Charming residents, but I'd like to see evidence of that.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I always enjoyed the previous Ice Age movies and this is no exception.  I have the one that came with the \\"Skrat Pack\\" dvd showing Skrat's shorts.  The kids enjoyed that.  Overall the movie was entertaining wasn't too scary for younger viewers and could still hold the attention of parents.
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin answered that question correctly: Houses of the Holy.  One can only imagine the pressure they must have felt as a band coming off of Led Zep IV.  Surely realizing that cracking more thunder than IV was going to be an impossibility at that point (a feat accomplished on their next album), would they take things down a notch and relax?  Get all progressive and experimental?  Have a laugh and not take it all so seriously?  Write a ballad????  Led Zeppelin could have gone any of those routes and when all was said and done...they took them all.  Starting off with a song unlike any they had ever written before, the ironically titled The Song Remains the Same ushered in a Zeppelin free from any perceived chains they may have been shackled with.  Frenetic, rollicking, lush, and dreamy, this was progress.  The humor, breeziness and just plain fun of tracks like Over the Hills and Far Away, The Crunge, Dancing Days, and D'yer Mak'er could also be considered progress for such an oh so heavy band.  Some may argue that writing a ballad this far into a career was a step back, but even on first listen to Rain Song you can't help but fall for its heart on sleeve romanticism completely.  But all of this would not even be possible without the album's true keystone:  No Quarter.  One of those rare songs with actual transporting and time travel capabilities - while listening you will surely feel yourself trudging uphill in a frozen tundra, ready for battles to the death with the faceless hordes offering, nor accepting mercy of any sort.  Yeah, it's a bada** tune, alright.  Ending on the perfect note with a sincere thank you to eachother and their sea of fans,  The Ocean both closes one chapter and opens another in the career of this totally awesome band.  But not even this would prepare people for the double dirty mind bending sexy beast that lie just around the corner...

B00003CXB4|1.0|The reason I chose to purchase this item from you is because the description that you put was exactly what I still need to find but unfortunately what I received was nothing like what you described. First it didnt come with the outer cardboard sleeve, Second the sleeve that it already comes with is not the original I could have printed out a better one with actual photo mat paper instead of regular xerox paper, last but not least the special edition movie that you described also comes with a book inside that shows all the special features. I expected to get what you advertised but instead I got screwed over twice and paid three times what this movie is worth. Word of advice be honest and dont waist peoples time or money.
9113020730|5.0|If you thought that the first two books of \\"Milennium\\" trilogy are full of action, think again. As compared to the third book, they are very slow moving. The third book starts at the moment when the second book stops - with Lisbeth Salander in the hospital, with a bullet in her brain and is non-stop action from this moment on.<br />The third book has more of everything as compared to the first two - more politics, more characters, more intrigues, more action. The only \\"less\\", probably, will be \\"less violence\\".  Which is not necessary a bad thing.<br />It is an excellent thriller that closes all the loops and explains everything that was left unexplained in previous book. My only regret is that we can't expect more books in those series! I wonder what other surprises Stieg Larsson planned in the future books...<br />The only drawback, from my perspective, was the fact that I wasn't able to put the book down - so many other things for this day were left unattended. Well, that's the book that you should take with you on transatlantic flight.

I think Slayer does not want to release it on DVD because they know they sound better here than War At The Warfield or Still Reigning. Hopefully a DVD version will be released someday. Its an excellent setlist too. If you still have a VHS player,& your into Slayer then you need to get this.

B002Y4KWS0|4.0|Unlike most of the reviewers who have posted regarding the new Stargate series, I find it to be a refreshing look at a complex established universe. The original Stargate was focused on the adventure of exploration; uncovering the secrets of other cultures and times, finding ourselves as an important part of various feuds and wars that go back as far as the ancients who created the gates. In Atlantis, this same format existed; with the twist that 'home' for that team was a less certain place. But as far as it went, the format of the show was virtually the same... resulting in ten or twelve seasons total in this style.     Stargate Universe is clearly a square peg in the familiar round hole. The tech is still there and there is plenty of potential for some of the old exploration and adventure. But at its heart, SGU is about people. It is far more 'real' than its predecessors, in its exploration of personal connections and survival, of obsessions and motivation. I think its no coincidence that the ship, Destiny, bears a physical resemblance to an anvil. The humans who have found their way to her are being tempered and forged into something much more than the 'wrong people' everyone claims them to be. That sort of story isn't always appealing to those who are looking for simple entertainment. And if it doesn't quite meet the standard presented by Battlestar Galactica for a sci-fi drama (yet), I believe it comes close and easily has room to grow into its full potential.

That is the exact predicament that Zoey has found herself in when a tracker shows up at her school and marks her. While Zoey is miserable in her home life, living with a Stepford-wife mother and the loser of a step-father, she didn't really want to move in to the House of Night and leave everythign she knew. Then again, no one else really wanted to go there either.    And so begins Marked, the first book in the House of Night series. It follows the newly marked Zoey and her posse of friends during their trials and tribulations, not only as teenagers, but as up and coming vampyres. Stay tuned for later updates on the following titles in the series: Betrayed, Chosen, Untamed, Hunted, and being released this October Tempted.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have been anticipating the release of this CD since I first heard Susan Boyle sing on Britans Got Talent. It did not disappoint. I love her voice and her passion for singing. She interprets the music so well and her voice is very expressive. The arrangements are masterful. Lady Susan's voice is healing and soothing. This CD definitely will be one of my timeless favorites.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|I purchased this cd for my husband but ended up stealing it for myself and for several months this CD did not leave my cd player in my car. This CD is a masterpiece. I fell in love with the track \\"Second Chance\\" but most of the other songs are just as fantastic especially \\"If you only knew,\\" and my favorite, \\"Call me.\\" The music and beats are great and the lyrics are extremely feeling and original. There is meaning behing the music. There are few rock bands these days that can put out a CD that is truly worth listening to through and through and that one will not tire of. This is one of them! If you liked \\"Second Chance\\" you will love this whole CD. It's a keeper.

B002T921DE|4.0|I read all the other reviews and I'm wondering if any of the previous reviewers actually listened to this before making their comments?<br /><br />If you have the means, you deserve to watch this in High Def.  The depth of color and separation of detail is fantastic.  All the way through I was loving the crispness, the colors and the sheer clarity.  The concert backdrop is interesting to watch anyway for the artistic vision supported through giant video with appropriate video and photos.  The lighting and laser show is about the best you'll see anywhere.  Thankfully George Michael is not overshadowed by supporting band and singers; you know they are there, they sound great, but you don't get the sense that any of them is ever the main act.  And nobody in the audience will feel cheated for not featuring in the credits.  Visually, brilliant.  You won't regret buying Blu on that basis.<br /><br />The audio is something else.  There are 3 sound tracks; standard is 2 channel Linear PCM.  With multiple speakers this comes across as a little better than crap so I won't dwell on it.  Flip up to DTS 5.1, even for head phones.  I experimented at length with different speaker and EQ settings and couldn't get it quite right at almost any volume.  Most of the time I felt there was too much bass.  Down low and at medium volumes I felt I needed to keep turning it up to appreciate the whole show.  Problem was that distortion kept creeping in and becoming more obvious on any song with strong bass bits.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not speaking the mantra as some super-critical audio purist where the sound should always be perfect.  I'm saying my wife and her friends noticed it as well the next day before I said anything about it.  Crank it up and the dance tracks will make your ears want to bleed out.  The peaks in each beat just seem to rumble and vibrate badly and you will be torn between turning it up ('cause it feels like the right thing to do) and turning it down (because it doesn't sound as damaged).  The 3rd sound option is Dolby Digital 5.1 where the volume drops and the quality seems similar to good MP3.  Go back to DTS and remember! it is not the default for almost every player!<br /><br />I really wanted to love this completely and give it top marks, but I have to be fair and take one star back for the quality of the audio.  I'm sure the engineers could have delivered better on this if they wanted to, so why isn't it better?  After all, aren't most people buying this because they love the sounds and the songs and they want the best audio experience possible?  Surely the visual is secondary to a killer concert soundtrack?<br /><br />I don't feel ripped off, just a little disappointed.<br /><br />This is the full concert.  More than 2 hours and packed with decades of hits.  George's commentary along the way is entertaining and seems heart-felt, but multiple F-bombs means it won't get the PG13 rating.  Great nonetheless.ed).  The 3rd sound option is Dolby Digital 5.1 where the volume drops and the quality seems similar to good MP3.

0618680004|5.0|I enjoyed this book much more than I did Christopher Hitchens: god is NOT Great.  I enjoyed it more, simply because it supplied the knowledge that I personally wanted.  As opposed to Hitchens, Dawkins is a scientist that offers arguments for atheism rather than simply trashing religion as Hitchens does.  Both authors have very interesting points, but I read both of these works to increase my knowledge of why people are atheist, and only Dawkins answers that question.  For an agnostic, this book will knock you off the fence and into the yard of atheism; and for a believer, you may end up questioning your priest a little more.  I am not saying this book has the power to turn a believer atheist, but I do dare say that if read by a believer, and that believer does not have any questions for his or her religion, then that person is not thinking for themselves.  This book offers too much information against the possibility of a God for any finished reader of The God Delusion to be 100 percent certain of a God like most believers are.
B002NUULNG|5.0|I will start by saying the original Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite films of all time.  I am a computer scientist researching AI, and it ranks right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner (Also The Matrix which was influenced heavily by GitS) for movies that have \\"shaped\\" my view of reality and what is possible.<br /><br />Now you should know that the \\"original\\" version of the film is indeed on this blu-ray, Thank you very much!  The original, however, does not look cleaned up like the \\"2.0\\" version is (maybe because \\"original\\" means untouched!).  I, like many other people commenting, much prefer the original masterpiece to this new \\"2.0\\" incarnation.  The original is still worth the purchase of this blu-ray.  Really one of the greatest films ever produced.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I teach 5th grade,and every year I have a few students (usually boys) who say they don't like to read.  I ask them to let me select a book for them with the promise they'll not want to put down the book.  I then hand over The Lightning Thief.  The first reaction is typically, \\"This book is too thick!\\"  I once again ask them to have a little faith in me and give the book a try.  Once they agree, their fate is sealed!  The action, humor, and Greek mythology ensnare my reluctant readers.  They can relate to Percy's ADHD and struggles with school/friends/girls/himself.  I have NEVER had a student not finish the book and ask for the rest of the series. My students who never liked to read suddenly ask to come in at recess to read or are caught with a book on their lap during math time!  What a horrible problem for a teacher to have!!!  I absolutely love these books and have read them several times, so I recommend them to adults as well.  If you think the size of the book may be too much for someone, then I recommend finding the Myth-O-Mania series by Kate McMullan.  They are shorter, humorous stories of Greek mythology told from Hades's point of view.  There is something about the Greek myths that captivates students who thought reading was useless.  Once they start reading books like the Percy Jackson and Myth-O-Mania series, they just take off and expand into other genres.  Buy these books!

The concept has moved very far from the original concept which pondered the relationship between early man and the animals in their world or is it the other way around?

0812550757|3.0|The sequel to Ender's Game certainly doesn't disappoint. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed EG. The author writes that he intended for the book to work on its own (whether or not the reader had read EG), and I am pretty sure it fails on that count, because so much of the hero's history (and that of auxiliary characters) is required knowledge.    The structure is a little disjointed, and feels like something is slightly off. This is distracting - and I feel that development of some of the main points of interest are sacrificed to this odd background noise (the introduction, development, and relevance/importance of the character Jane, for instance). This is a point I'll return to momentarily - - in the meantime, I'm rating it a 3 because I did like the book overall - and I was satisfied with the plot, pacing and resolution. The answer to the mystery at the heart of the tale was telegraphed too early - - but perhaps this was necessary because it was a fairly complex bit of alien circumstance (for the time the book was written).    As for the weird vibe - the author is a controversial figure.  [...]  There is a theory that Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are allegory for the life of Adolf Hitler that include 'tells' from that historical figure's biography - even into the speculative legends of his having survived to live on in Brazil and continue a legacy that his followers find compelling and honorable. There is even a theory that Card didn't actually write the books. A controversial whistle was blown following the publication of Speaker - and is said by some to account for the long hiatus between Speaker and Xenocide, a very peculiar circumstance considering the acclaim, attention and awards heaped upon EG and SftD.    Regardless of whatever odd goings-on did or did not spawn these books - I enjoyed them. If, someday, it turns out that they were considered a surprise to spring on an accepting audience (ha ha - I made you like Hitler), or something darker (ripening a broad audience to be receptive to a neo-nazi renaissance?) - I'll discard them. For now - I find the accusations more fascinating than compelling or dangerous, and can give a 3 star rating to the work itself without reservation.    I also suggest that readers who enjoyed these check out the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Muse just grows in sophistication with every album.  Their early albums were delightful for their rawness, revelling in layers of rhythm and power.  I loved them.  This picks up where the others left off, but carries their ideas further, with frequent homage to musical influences; from Queen and the Beatles, to classical composers.  On my first listening, there were moments I could have sworn were sampled from Queen (maybe they were), but there were also direct quotes from the classical repertoire; and some of my favorite moments were not quotations, but allusions to the style of e.g. the Bach-Gounod Ave Maria, or the Moonlight Sonata.  The album adheres to a theme, as has become Muse' wont, but it seems that it holds together better than previous efforts have.  It is no longer just a collection of songs.  To call it a rock symphony might not be overstating the case.    These guys can still lay on the rhythm and the power, but they are now showing that they have learned from a huge and eclectic collection of other musicians.  I am not sure where they are going, but I'll follow them there.

B001KL3GZO|5.0|On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the recording of \\"Kind of Blue\\", Sony has released seemingly the 50th version of the album.  Let me just say, it's well worth buying again.  No need to go into the musical content, everyone is familiar with it by now.  As drummer Jimmy Cobb, the last surviving musician for the sessions said, it must have been made in heaven.    The reason to buy this, as with the new Beatles reissues, is the remastering.  This is my third iteration of KOB.  I had the gold disc and the 1997 reissue, and this one just blows them both away in terms of sound quality.  I'm listening to this 50 year-old recording on a 20 year-old Kenwood amplifier and 15 year-old Klipsch speakers, and I swear it's like I'm at the recording session!      Factor in the second disc of the only other recordings made by this lineup, and this release is a bargain.
B001FB55I0|2.0|I had high hopes for this film.  I have to say it failed on almost all levels.  I gave it 2 stars because it does look good.  However that was it.  The plot was dreadful the script even worse. If you have to watch it how many times do they yell \\"hang on\\" it is like a drinking game with Keanu Reeves.  I like Bale and was suprised at how little they gave him.  And what was with the child who did not speak.  What a blatant Hollywood ploy to try and create some emotion, just awful.  Wait for cable for this one as you will not be happy if you own it.
B000IOM1Z0|4.0|The fifth album for The Alan Parsons Project was a change for the changing times. By 1980, disco had reshaped the industry, though it was in its last throes when \\"Turn Of A Friendly Card\\" arrived. Record companies were beginning to feel an economic pinch for the first time in years. The result was artists tightening up their music and presentation, and APP was no exception. From the lack of a gatefold sleeve to the more pop-oriented single \\"Games People Play,\\" this was a shift towards radio friendliness that would peak when [[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]] was released two years later.<br /><br />There were marked differences in other departments. First and most, Eric Woolfson sang lead vocals for the first time. Two songs features his voice in front, \\"Time\\" and \\"Nothing Left to Lose.\\" The dreamy \\"Time\\" became a top 20 single and also moved APP into adult contemporary territory. That certainly settled the suits at Arista, certainly.<br /><br />However, the original album's side two was a suite as only the progminded Parsons could have pieced together. Bookended by the two-parted title track, it was where the album's themes of addiction, risk and greed are weighed in. \\"Snake Eyes\\" is the key track, as singer Chris Rainbow urgently pleas for 'just one minute more' is anticipation that the next card will bring him the riches that he just knows await. Woolfson's sad \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" shows the gambler realizing that rock bottom is nearer than he ever thought, with beautiful backing vocals. It's some of APP's best work, and makes \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" one of The Project's most cohesive albums.<br /><br />Like the rest of the re-masters in this series, the sound is fantastic. Every time I've listened to this series (been on an APP jag lately), I get more and more frustrated by 'the loudness wars' that seem to be utterly destroying popular music of late. When you listen to the epic instrumental prelude to \\"May Be A Price to Pay,\\" you may (like me) start wondering where the next generation of classic producer/engineers are going to come from.ion of classic producer/engineers are going to come from.

0345444051|1.0|This is likely the worst science fiction novel I have ever read to completion, and I am a actually a fan of Clarke's.    The primary flaw in this early book of is Clarke's is his misunderstanding of the nature of suspense.  Suspense derives not from an author's withholding concrete facts from the reader and then dropping them on him out of the blue, but from building up and plausibly resolving individual moral conflicts that drive a meaningful story.     The basic plot line is that humans as a species are about to evolve into a super-organism whose hive mind will transcend the limits of individual consciousness and allow the direct manipulation of reality by act of will.  This is a cliche as old as the Orient and so trite and overdone (Solaris, Where No Man Has Gone Before, etc.,) that it should be outlawed.  Since, in Clarke's version, only the children will \\"transcend\\" and they will lose their individuality as they do so, there is no way for us to identify with or care about the transition.  The adult characters who will not evolve into this supposedly higher form are reduced to mere bystanders unable to influence events and hence of very little interest.     The way Clarke attempts to maintain suspense is by arbitrarily depriving us of certain bits of knowledge.  The \\"Overlords,\\" a very powerful race of aliens, are sent to help mankind transition to the next level.  But they hide themselves from view.  What do the Overlords look like?  When we are finally told they resemble a certain type of being from human mythology it is a disappointing anticlimax.  There is no twist, no action, no moral consequence, just a revelation, deus ex machina, that comes across as nothing more than a cheap stunt.    There is no presentation or exploration of motive in this novel.  Why do the Overlords, who cannot transition themselves, take on the role of galactic social workers?  Why is it necessary for the Overlords to institute a world state and universal health care for a race that will soon evolve out of existence?  Why do researchers helping the Overlords collect specimens of earth life such as a sperm whale and then replace it with a model?  What, exactly, is so special about the child Jeffrey whom the Overlords protect from an arbitrary physical disaster?  Nothing in the entire novel results from choice, value or effort.    Sure, Clarke presents us with spectacles such as an astronaut who hitchhikes to the Overlord planet where he witnesses mountain sized aliens and a gargantuan disembodied eye.  But none of it makes any sense or has any repercussions.  The story is a hash of unintegrated random and not particularly special special effects.  Obscurity is not profundity.  A sequence of capricious developments is not a plot.  In a world where anything can happen nothing is of consequence and the reader cannot really care.
B001QOGYB8|5.0|I enjoyed this film as much as my five year-old daughter. It was quite refreshing to have an uncomplicated story meant for kids that doesn't patronize--certain \\"adult\\" themes like a a married couple arguing over the husband's career choices or mistakes, the \\"existential\\" crisis -- are left in, giving you in the end a film that works, I think, for all ages. Well done by all. I particularly like the visual style and soundtrack. Her favorite part: the surprise glimpse of the wolf.

It wasn't a total disappointment but it wasn't Sophie's best work either.

But, dry heat and bull running mania were for  for this man.<br /><br />Spanish sayings abound in this novel about simple people asked to do a job - perhaps simple - in the name of the cause: blow up a bridge.  But, the pithy and poignant statements of implyingly illiterate gypsy Pilar cannot be matched by 17th century philosophers. For example Spain, in her words, is \\"where blasphemy keeps pace with the austerity of religion.\\"<br /><br />When protagonist Robert Jordan speaks English for a short time to some of the group, Pilar tells him to revert to Spanish as \\"no language is truer.\\"  She later concludes that \\"Spanish is shorter and simpler.\\"<br /><br />And, Hemingway's influence on this language shows as some verbs are paradoxically used -- each time the root of Spanish for English usage.  One example is to constantly implement Spanish molestar in English sentences to ask that people stop molesting one another, when the translation is not to bother one another.<br /><br />But, these linguistic nuances are the special effect, the unique style, the cutting edge to the Nobel winning writing style of Hemingway.  It is the sentences of Spanglish or otherwise, compounded with his ever seemless simplification, that make this novel resound.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel also for its slow beginning and its heightening to a crescendo for its  ending.  His language and other writing angles seem to mature as the novel progresses.  He slowly captures the reader, and has you under his exclusive control the last third of the book.<br /><br />Although Hemingway makes this a love story at a time of war, parts are seemingly unreal.  Knowing that he is going to die the next day, Robert Jordan meets one last time with beautiful Maria.  And, as they are about to start doing the deed, he stops and asks if she hurts.  I am sure that you can interview many a disagreeing  soldier under similar circumstances and ask if the concept of pain to the sexual partner ever entered their mind when they were having what would perhaps be their last moment of heaven on this man's earth - they would all agree that this was not exactly what they had in mind<br /><br />But, this is a classic and worthy of reading.  I waited over 40 years between readings and received very different messages. Each time good.are about to start doing the deed, he stops and asks if she hurts.

6305076995|5.0|This is classic '70s Yes and it's great to visualize the album.  An absolute highlight is witnessing Steve Howe's guitar mastery and 'other worldly' abitlities on The Clap.  The whole thing is a 'trip' for the senses and the memories!  The recording and colour are great - you won't be disappointed.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I know many people who are opposed to health care reform.  I, for one, think everyone should view Michael Moore's video \\"Sicko\\".  It is not a boring documentary and will let you know what you need to know about our health care system.
1416594787|5.0|I've been mousing around for 5 years trying to open my mind to the full glory and immensity of evolution. Several books lead me along the path, but this might be the first to fully enlighten me. I find it more than a little funny to resort to language like \\"glory\\" and \\"enlighten\\" in order to praise an evolutionist's manifesto against christian creationism. In my defense, I believe knowledge can be just as spiritual and soulful a pursuit as religion. The Greatest Show on Earth is first-rate, mind blowing stuff. Dawkins technically persuasive book on evolution is scaled back just enough so I can wholly understand the multiple sciences supporting evolution. His clear and concise science writing and his sensational subject are both deserving of the title, \\"The Greatest Show on Earth.\\" An updated version of his book should be read every 10 years ... by everyone. Regarding the beauty and endurance of evolution, a favorite quote comes to mind, \\"Ever present never twice the same, ever changing never less then whole.\\"
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Bought this Cd for my brother and he is \\"stoked\\". He loves every track so thank you Amazon.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I pre-ordered this cd after I saw the video for wild horses- i could not beleive how beautiful and powerful her voice was- when the cd came i was surprised that this (the cd) wild horsere version was not the same- then i listened to the rest and felt like she was trying to do an Allison Krauss imitiation- I think her voice is extraordinary but the people who picked these songs and did the albumn really struck out- the whisper voice doesnt work with her- her voice is so powerful and moving and they did not let it out- also all the songs were similar- nothing upbeat- and they have her singing every song the same way almost to the same beat - I bought this to support this women as i am sure others have- but the reality is she has a gift for a voice and the people who made this cd really blew it-
1401219268|5.0|I can't believe that Watchmen was written 25 years ago. It provided the template for the gritty and deconstructionist approach to superheroes we're used to right now.<br /><br />I highly recommend Watchmen to comic book fans whose tastes are evolving and moving out of the classic \\"good guy versus bad guy\\" dynamic.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Excellent CD. You can hear the emotion in ever song, especially the orginal song \\"Who I Was Born To Be.\\" I look forward to more Susan Boyle. An inspirational personal story and an inspiring voice.

B001UW58YK|5.0|I absolutely loved this Blu-Ray. I got it after seeing the reviews for one of his other DVD's and decided to get this one instead. Crystal clear. Beautiful sound. His juvenile nature and all his jokes get sort of annoying for such serious music...but whatever..he's the one on stage, not me!
B001UW58WW|5.0|I recently saw David Garrett in Concert and fell in love with his playing.  Watching him was half the fun.  My husband bought me this CD right afterwards and I love it!  He plays, along with his band of a drummer, guitar, and keyboard, an eclectic mixture of music--classical, various forms of contemporary including ballads and rock  and his own compositions, intermixing genres and tempos nicely.  Listening to the CD makes me smile.
0786868724|5.0|Really hit home for me.  Makes you really think hard & deep about how you are prioritizing.  Makes you realize more the value of people around you & your loved ones.  Makes you realize the beauty of those around you that you just fail to notice because you're too busy minding your own life.
B002SF9Y8E|4.0|The people writing one-star reviews for this album apparently aren't familiar with Dylan's recent music. If you know what his voice and his band sound like nowadays, the sound of this album probably won't be a shock (except maybe for the female chorus -- more like a vintage Christmas LP than the soulful female backups heard on a lot of Dylan's '70s and '80s music). Essentially, it's the current Dylan sound applied to some familiar Christmas tunes (and a few less familiar, including probably the best and least \\"kitschy\\" track, Christmas Blues). Yes, I do think Bob is consciously indulging in a bit of kitsch, but it still comes across as a sincere performance of music he truly appreciates. In his memoir published a few years ago, Chronicles Vol. 1, he refers to his fondness for Christmas music, dating from his Minnesota days.    Still, I think the five-star reviews are a little out of hand. To me, five-star Dylan is Freewheelin', Highway 61, Blood on the Tracks, and a few others. This one certainly doesn't scale those heights. The chorus singers handle more vocals than you might expect on some songs where I would have liked to hear more Bob. (Plus, as my title suggests, vinyl buyers don't get the fun Bettie Page pic, but I didn't dock points for that.)
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|Well, first of all, the theater version was missing several songs from the dvd, including:<br /><br />Flawless<br />You Have Been Loved<br />An Easier Affair<br />Too Funky<br />My Mother Had A Brother<br />Fantasy<br />Careless Whisper<br />John And Elvis Are Dead (Intermission song from the concerts)<br />Precious Box<br />Jesus To A Child<br />First Time Ever I Saw Your Face<br /><br />I'd Know Him A Mile Off(Documentary)<br /><br />That's a whole lotta stuff to be missing but it was still absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!  I felt like I was right back at those three concerts watching George in person.  The volume in the theater was extra loud so it really was almost like being there again.  If you didn't have the pleasure of seeing him live, this dvd will make up for it, believe me!  The energy of Spinning The Wheel is worth a mention, it's amazing that this 45 year old man with rods in his back can still get his groove on like that.  WOW!! The ONLY thing missing from this entire dvd (for me) was Kissing A Fool.  George did that song here in the U.S. as a gift to us.  He had never done that song live on any other tour, so it really was a very special gift.  Sadly, it is not included because this entire dvd was filmed in London (as you can see from the title). Luckily, I bought a dvd of the Madison Square Garden show, so at least I get to see George sing it on that one. This dvd is beautifully filmed with behind the scenes costume changes, close-ups and shots of the videos/images on the screens behind him as well as some great shots of the audience/arena.  To put it simply, if you went to his concerts, buy this!!  If you didn't go to his concerts, buy this!!  It's an experience to remember for a lifetime!!
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I saw the film and was amazed to see Michael doing what he did best. Peform. It touched me deeply, a bitter sweet feeling. I cried so hard at the loss of him. So I got the cd and love it. His sweet voice is so pure and it makes me feel happy. I think you should get the cd, it is his last curtain call.
B002RKXO6S|2.0|For me, Bon Jovi is that band that I try to explain away as a joke when people see it on my iPod - which, needless to say, doesn't exactly pan out when they see I own about 90% of the band's entire library. They're a guilty pleasure for sure, but what a pleasure they are when they're at their peak.    \\"The Circle,\\" however, doesn't put that smile on my face like the rest of the band's work does. In fact, it's a pretty bland affair. The songs collectively lack passion or excitement... the album is basically just a constant drone of overproduced noise. Bon Jovi's more recent material isn't exactly known for its raw, stripped down sound, but where Crush, Bounce, and Have a Nice Day used loud pop production in order to give more excitement and liveliness to the sound, The Circle basically just layers pointless effects onto vocal and guitar tracks that too frequently add nothing to the song.    \\"We Weren't Born to Follow\\" opens the album. It's a solid enough song musically, but the message is hamfisted and lacks any hint of subtlety. I understand that many people love this band for their positive messages, but the lack of originality in the delivery of that message has grown very thin - there are only so many times you can repackage the theme of \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" before it starts getting old and stale. Musically, the song is catchy enough, but I liked it more when it was called \\"Born to Be My Baby.\\"    \\"When We Were Beautiful\\" attempts something new, but, like the rest of the album, it suffers from a lack of a soul. The arrangement is fairly interesting by Bon Jovi standards, with some cool guitar drone in the background and backing vocals that really work with the song. Good guitar solo from Richie too. Jon Bon Jovi's vocal delivery is a little overdramatic at times, but overall, it's a pretty cool song. It's growing on me pretty quick.    \\"Work for the Working Man\\" is a great old-school Bon Jovi tune. The pulsing bassline in the verses feels straight from \\"You GiveLove a Bad Name,\\" and the choruses have that classic big Bon Jovi sing-along sound. This is one of the few songs on the album that has good hooks in it. The bridges are great as well. And after the first bridge, the sustained chords in the first two lines of the chorus are absolutely satisfying. Great song overall, one of the few memorable songs that I'll keep coming back to.    \\"Superman Tonight.\\" Not much to say about this one. Just bland and not very good with very forgettable hooks. Fades to the background of whatever you're doing, no matter how loud you play it.    \\"Bullet\\" stands out from the rest of the album in that its much heavier right from the beginning. It's very similar in musical feel to \\"Hook Me Up\\" from the Bounce album, for better or for worse. The verses are pretty cool, but the chorus is one of the most lazy and forgettable in any recent Bon Jovi rocker. The lyrics ramble vaguely about violence and poverty, but it feels inauthentic. Overproduction again hinders this song - Jon's \\"yeah yeah\\"s in the background are too processed and just doesn't sound cool like its supposed to. But, on a more positive note, Richie's guitar solo is absolutely amazing and he packs all that he can into the short time he's given for it. Also, the guitar riff that appears in the middle and at the end of the song is a crunchy, satisfying, awesome riff. But why is it only played twice in the whole song?    \\"Thorn in My Side\\" is a nice little ditty. The vocal hook in the beginning of each verse is great, and the choruses are strong as well. The rest seems to kind of blend into the background though. Good guitar solo too.    \\"Live Before You Die\\" is, quite frankly, pretty dreadful to my ears due to painful lyrics filled with fake stories about what people never actually said to Jon in real life. They're hokey. They're insincere. They're tired. Hearing this song just makes me want to find Bon Jovi on the street and scream in his face that we get it already (that is, assumingI'd actually want to walk around in New Jersey). If people find inspiration in this song, then that's wonderful... but for me, it just doesn't work.    \\"Brokenpromiseland\\" isn't bad but it's nothing amazing. Feels like it belongs in the middle of \\"Have a Nice Day,\\" which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a decent pop song with a lively tempo and some cool use of matching piano and vocal \\"oh oh\\" hooks in the background. It almost starts to feel Coldplay-ish in the middle, but it works. This one's also growing on me a bit.    \\"Love's the Only Rule.\\" This song could be Beethoven's 9th Symphony musically, but it would still be a terrible song solely due to the lyric \\"Think about it, wouldn't it be cool? Love's the only rule.\\" Not since \\"remember that you're perfect, God makes no mistakes\\" has such a lyrical travesty befallen my ears.    \\"Fast Cars\\" is another forgettable track with some pretty bland hooks, especially the chorus. Feels like a b-side that they tried their hardest to polish into an album cut. The obligatory Springsteen homage was much stronger on previous albums (like \\"Right Side of Wrong,\\" for instance, an absolutely beautiful song despite its unoriginalities).    \\"Happy Now.\\" At this point of the album, I'm just thinking \\"is it over yet?\\" There's some semblance of decent lyrics buried in this song somewhere, but they're hard to place. Interesting take on their usual message though, I'll give them credit for that. But musically, it's uninspired.    \\"Learn to Love.\\" This U2 cover is quite good, and a solid closer that at least leaves a decent taste in your mouth when the CD stops spinning. What's that you say? It's a Bon Jovi original? Interesting.    So, in conclusion, \\"The Circle\\" feels forced and underthought. As other reviewers have stated, the overall feel of the album is heavy and overdramatic rather than light and fun. This may work with some bands, but with Bon Jovi, I'll spin These Days if I want some good music from them with a slightly darkertone. Otherwise, I want to smile and sing along and feel good while feeling oh-so-wrong at the same time. This album has been called the band's \\"return to rock.\\" But it's still a step behind their previous \\"rock\\" record, Have A Nice Day. Bon Jovi, here's some advice for you: ease back on the effects, lighten the mood a bit, and put more thought into your lyrics (I know you can do it - you wrote \\"Dry County,\\" for god's sake!). And please, PLEASE... put some HOOKS into your songs next time.
B001FB55I0|3.0|Terminator 4 is not per se a bad movie, but its not a very good one.  The problem lies with the director's choices which parallel the scripts choices, that is, the concentration on machines.  The director is far more interested in the special effects and creating the bleak environment of post-judgment day using computers and machines than the characters themselves.  Similarly the script is more interested in the \\"fake\\" terminator of Marcus than in John Connor or humanity.  Though I don't want to reference the great earlier terminator movies, what's was crucial to the story is that it was humanity struggling to survive and fighting to prevent the future.  Sadly, this movie loses both of these things, being set in a time where the future was created, with characters are two-dimensional at best.  Why does John Connor fight the machines?  He doesn't seem to have any actual desire to fight, but only does so because its what he was told to do.  Similarly the soldiers are largely emotionless and uncaring, not interested in doing anything but destroying things.  Oddly the only character who has even a little humanity is a machine, marcus.  Sadly, I didn't really care about him as there is no real reason to, other than he's the protaganist of the story.  Sadly this movie reminds me of how I felt watching arnold as the first terminator, it was tense, dark, and muscular, but completely lacked any feeling.    As to the blu-ray, I feel there is going to be a double dip down the line, as there are very few features, and the ones that exist aren't that great.  However, the picture looks pretty great, especially the effects.  Maybe worth renting, but I can't see it in my collection.
B001FB55I0|4.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatre and I loved it again when I got my copy on blu-ray, the action sequence, the special effects, the script, well, I was entertained, call me crazy for all those people who gave   this a movie a bad review, the audio and video on blu-ray, I give it 4 out of 5 stars, Sam Worthington, I think   that man has a bright future in Hollywood, loved his performance. For the people who will decide to add this   movie to their movie library like I did, I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did, I will see it a few more  times for sure.

Made my meager efforts at exercise seem like nothing!  I was so intrigued with his consistent sense of the presence and power of God in the midst of battle.  Continuously I thought, what a huge God who can walk a man through this kind of horror, so far away yet covered.  I was so blessed to read of the hospitality shown him in the village.  Powerful.  It was powerful to me to hear straight from the heart truth of what we are dealing with in this battle being fought not just \\"over there\\" but with powers and principalities.  I was impacted by this book.  Thank you Marcus for writing it!

I'd like to see more sketches, but considering most of his materials are sold or destroyed, I really can't complain.  This book is so worth buying.
B001P3SA94|4.0|CADILLAC RECORDS(2008)---Adrien Brody, Jeffrey Wright, Gabrielle Union, Cedric The Entertainer, Beyonce Knowles, Columbus Short, Emmanuel Chriqui, Eamonn Walker.<br />A film that tells the story of the legendary blues record label, Chess/Checker Records.  As with most films of this kind, there is some blending of \\"artistic license\\" and the historical facts.  However, as a devoted \\"blues freak\\", whose first album purchase was by a Chess/Checker artist, I found that, for the most part, the story is told with a great deal of factual accuracy and a minimum of \\"dramatic enhancement\\".  The label was started by Leonard Chess(nee,Czyz) and his brother Phil, two immigrant Polish Jews.  The unifying theme of the film is the relationship that developed between Leonard and Muddy Waters(aka, McKinley Morganfield).  Leonard owned a bar called the Macomba Lounge on Chicago's South Side that catered predominantly to blacks and featured black musicians.  As a result of owning the nightclub, Leonard began to realize that the real money was to be made by recording the artists who played the blues music that his customers came to hear.  From the insurance money he got as a result of an \\"unfortunate\\" fire that burned down the Macomba, Chess started his record label.  Chess became the home of a virtual, \\"Who's Who\\", of Chicago blues artists, many of whom had migrated north from the cotton fields of their native south.  By \\"plugging in\\" and amplifying the blues music they had brought with them, they effected a revolution in the genre.  In addition to Muddy Waters, who was perhaps the single most important figure in that revolution, artists who recorded for Chess included: Etta James; Howlin' Wolf(aka, Chester Burnett); Little Walter Jacobs, who was one of the first to amplify his blues harmonica playing, and is generally regarded as the greatest blues harpist ever; Bo Diddley(aka, Ellas McDaniel); and, the Father of Rock & Roll Guitar, Chuck Berry.  In addition to these performers, Chess was blessed by having on board a gentleman by the name of Willie Dixon, who was the \\"house bass player\\" and, much more importantly, wrote the bulk of the songs recorded by Waters, Wolf, Jacobs, et. al.---his list of writing credits is simply stunning---and far too lengthy to list here.  Suffice it to say that the bulk of what became the basic \\"blues canon\\" was written by two men: Willie Dixon and Robert Johnson.  The time frame of the story is compressed, but the story is told accurately and it doesn't gloss over some of the uglier aspects of the story.  It is well-known that Chess took a \\"paternalistic\\" approach to his artists---he \\"took care of them\\", doling out money whenever they needed to pay the rent or buy a home or needed bail money to get out of jail.  He also was in the habit of buying his artists a new Cadillac when they had a #1 record, hence the title of the film.  But, he also cheated many of them when it came to paying the artist's royalties they were entitled to, and the film depicts that aspect of the \\"Chess story\\" candidly.  With the rise of rock & roll, and the so-called \\"British Invasion\\" of the 60's, Chess was eventually forced to sell the label and died of a heart attack shortly thereafter, which is where the film ends.  Some of the Chess artists experienced \\"career revivals\\" when the British blues musicians who worshiped them, and grew up listening to their records, brought them to Europe to tour and hired them to open their shows in the U.S.  The various actors portraying the principals all give effective, convincing portrayals.  Adrien Brody is quite good as Chess, and Jeffrey Wright and Beyonce Knowles are particularly good as Muddy Waters and Etta James, respectively.  The only real criticisms I have of the film are: 1)Instead of using the actual recordings of the various artists, the actors portraying them do the singing and, while they all do a credible job, given their historical importance, I think it would have been better to have them \\"lip-synch\\" the original recordings; and 2)no mention whatsoever is made of Bo Diddley, who was one of the seminal figures of early rock&roll---he also wrote many songs that became \\"blues standards\\", e.g., \\"Who Do You Love\\"; \\"Mona\\"; \\"I'm a Man\\"; etc.  This seemed to me an incredible omission.  But, those cavils aside, this is a \\"must-see\\" film for any fan of the blues or for anyone who might like to know more about the genre and the performers who put \\"the blues\\" on the musical map.ip-synch\\" the original recordings; and 2)no mention whatsoever is made of Bo Diddley, who was one of the seminal figures of early rock&roll---he also wrote many songs that became \\"blues standards\\", e.g., \\"Who Do You Love\\"; \\"Mona\\"; \\"I'm a Man\\"; etc.  This seemed to me an incredible omission.

B000000W9Z|4.0|Outside was trashed by critics when it came in 1995, and for the life of me, I don't understand why. This was Bowie's first collaboration with Brian Eno since the  great 1970s trilogy, [[ASIN:B00001OH7W Low]],[[ASIN:B00001OH7V Heroes]]and [[ASIN:B00001OH7X Lodger]].<br /><br />I guess the critics wanted both to get into a time machine and go back to Berlin '77, or to create something they could easily tag as \\"an album as good, but with a modern sound.\\" These idiots got neither--leave it to a music critic to build expectations and then have a hissy fit when he or she does not get what he or she wants. My bet: these prises probably trashed the Berlin Trilogy in the 1970s, too.<br /><br />Outside is a marvelous album, full of, yes, 1990s sounds and textures. This is science fiction music using modern eletronics.<br /><br />But two things lift Outside far above most 1990s electronic \\"experiements.\\" First, the songs here work by any standard. The lyrics are great and Bowie sings fantastically, mostly in is late day, Scott Walker voice.<br /><br />Second, the electronic use on this album is extremely detailed. Entire textures are created using digital equiptment here. These ARE textures, not SHEENS! There are wierd time shifts, and layers and layers of counterpoint going on in all this music--much more so than in even Radioheads electronic adventures, which I like.<br /><br />All of the work here is as complex as it would be if Bowie and Eno were using an orchestra or a large horn section.<br /><br />The music is an outstanding study in dynamics, that just happen to be created BY electronics.<br /><br />I wonder which guy from Rolling Stone or Spin will be raising his hand in 2020, saying, \\"I pegged that one as a classic the day it came out.\\"<br /><br />Yeah. Go give five stars to Jessica Simpson, mellonhead.

B002OB9KPE|3.0|OK, Here I go..please do not throw me virtual tomatos (*chuckles*) !    First of all, I would like to make a stament:  I love Transatlantic previous installments (I find them flawless), although this is my first Transatlantic review.    Second,  I am a very big fan of Spock's Beard-Neal Morse era (the current one is great, but the former one is simply epic and an actual gem of the contemporary prog rock), I am also a Flower King fan (and a Karmakanic fan too !!) and I have enjoyed so far, some Dream Theater albums (specially the latter ones).  In the other hand, although I am not keen on Marillion, I really respect Pete Trewavas.     With all these said:  I think I can review \\"The Whirlwind\\" with all the proper right to do so. And please I do not want to sound bigot.    I expected this release for months( I pre-ordered it as many of you did), but after giving all possible spins to try to assimilate the album, I end myself with a sort of disappointment.  And I emphasize \\"a sort\\", because \\"The Whirlwind\\" itself isn't a terrible album, but a very hard to follow one (I am referring to the 77 minute epic eponymous track).  Nevertheless, there are some movements or tracks (another way to refer to)that really stand allone from the whole outcome.    The second disk, however, has short songs (with the exception of Genesis cover \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\") and all of them are simply O.K., not great, but O.K. I mean catchy and sometimes snappy.  There are otherse covers too. And I found particulary \\"I Need you\\" very interesting, considering that the songs is a little meddley from America's and The Beatles' same tittle theme.    It is worth to buy it? Yes, why not?, The guys are really great musicians and the way the album is mixed and produced is very good one.  Besides, there are some personal feelings involved in the making and inspiration of the album need to be recognized by his hard core fans, plus this is also a reunion of good friends that join themselves together to make a prog rock jam session.  I must add too, that If you got the previous outstanding albums and you want to keep following the guys;  the answer again is YES.    I have read all the albums review posted here and I respect them all.    Believe me when I am telling you, and I don't want to sound dramatic, that I wish I could have gave \\"The Whirlwind\\" five stars as I feel \\"STPM\\" and \\"BAF\\" deserved them. I hope next installment will be better.    Hope my review will be helpful to you !    Cheers,  Francisco

Well I think we have all had good AND bad experiences with this. Sometimes colors are left behind, frame rates are messy, and my favorite-terrible sound quality... Not something we want to see/hear when paying top dollar for the newest and \\"best\\" format. Then there are the jaw-droppers. You just can't believe your eyes and ears. Are you sure we aren't in the theater? Now that's what we want!<br /><br />Okay, enough rambling on about Blu-Rays in general. Lets cut to the chase. The Grinch on Blu-Ray is good. Not horrible, not spectacular. You will be impressed, but not blown away. Is the Grinch one of your holiday favorites, like the above reviewer? Then GET THIS BLU-RAY! Is it just \\"another movie\\" that you like to have around and might only watch once in a blue moon? Then stick with (or just rent) the DVD version.<br /><br />Well, that's all I've got to say about Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas [Blu-ray]
B000TXNDUW|5.0|Choosing between this 1960 origional or the 1980s Richard Gere version of Breatless, it is this, no contest.<br /><br />This is arguabley the first French New Wave film, and contains the ingrediants. Lots of jump cuts, ten minute shots, uniuqe camara angles.<br />Watch the scene where Belmondo steals the car, or where he is in the room with Jean Seaberg, where the same shot is held for the whole dialouge, panning camara.<br /><br />Breathless is a pretty simple crime film: steel car, accidental murder, elude police, romantic interest. But it is the way that Godard uses film technique to tell the story that makes it work. You see a old stroy told in a fresh way.<br /><br />These shooting and editing techniques are now used constantly on TV to make the medium look hip, but in 1960, these were truely experimental and enhanced the STORY. Godard remebered here, story came first.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Both my wife and I loved this movie. Good story, great characters, great production. It's funny, sad, and interesting. What else can you really ask for?    Though I do wish there was a 50% less lens flare version!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I loved the cd.  Can't wait for the next one.  I hope she goes on tour.
B001GMH8RO|2.0|This classic stands up well. There are some nice additions to this BR-Disc such as interviews from the time the movie was made which are a little haunting when Patrick Swayze appears for his insight. So, the special features are enough to lure you in more about this movie and it 's background.     The Blue Ray transfer either could have been better or it was as good as it was going to get. The clarity is soft (but improved from the DVD version)and blacks are okay. The color match up well but are not instant by first notice. The audio is decent as well. So, if you are interested for Blue Ray reasons? It is a nice investment to your collection ongoing or just starting out.     But, I strongly suggest to first check out either [...] or Blue Ray Digest for a more well thought out review of this classic.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|King Kong is probably the greatest movie of all time. It pioneered a ton of new film making tricks & techniques. A boring person would shove Citizen Kane up your ass & say that was the best movie ever! That movie was also innovative for its time & pioneered new techniques, but look at King Kong! Kong came out nearly 10 years before Citizen Kane. They had to invent new filming techniques. Such as having an actor performing in front of a rear projection. They would sometimes have the two pieces of film composited together! This movie is simply, the best ever!
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Those new to the Beatles will hear from older fans that Rubber Soul is where the fab four became a much more mature band.<br /><br />This is true. Though the Beatles were evolving with each album--\\"I'm A Loser\\" was at the end of 1964 and leaps ahead of anything that would have been recorded early that year--Rubber Soul was the first entire album that let you know something different was going on.<br /><br />\\"Norigian Wood\\" was about an affair John had, and it  was known to all he was married. \\"The Word\\" was a love anthem a full two years before hippies became part of the culture. \\"Think For Yourself\\" and \\"Girl\\" delt with the adult complexities of love in a way only Dylan had before.<br /><br />\\"Girl\\" in particular is John saying the girl is driving him crazy, but he does not want to give up the sex. Nobody had even implied this before--and this bold stroke is why the Beatles were the Beatles. They just did what no  one else would.<br /><br />All fab four were listening to Bob Dylan. Rubber Soul was them taking  this depth in writting and applying it to their sound. The Beatles did what they always did--took influences and turned them into something new. Rubber Soul is them stepping this process up. After this came Revolver, and they progreseed in quantum leaps, not giant steps, from here out.<br /><br />This album will work better in mono. Out of all the albums, Rubber Soul is probably the most clean and least complicated with its use of accustic guitars.<br /><br />Still, I find that the Stereo American version of the album, which does not have \\"Drive My Car,\\" \\"Nowhere Man,\\" \\"What Goes On\\" or \\"If I needed Someone\\" is actually a more focused album--with all the rock stuff sliced, Rubber Soul becomes a tight folk masterpeiece. In America, the deleted tracks were on Yesterday And Today.<br /><br />But don't fret. Easy answer. Get both versions of Rubber Soul.
B0017WCG48|1.0|After reading all of the glowing reviews of this LP I was very excited to get a copy.  I have to say that I was completely disapointed.  At first, I thought the turntable or phono pre amp had a problem.  But when I listened to another LP, it sounded great.  This isn't like when you see a movie that has great reviews and it doesn't live up to the hype, it is worse then that.  This is, simply put, a very bad sounding LP.      When I compared it to the CD remastered in 1999, the CD just blew it away.  Given the extent to which this album was made there is no reason for this.  I cannot understand how anyone can think that this sounds good in ANY way.  It is always possible that I received a bad copy or the 100,000 press but I don't think that's it.    Save your money, buy the CD.
B002OG5GT8|5.0|I'm hard of hearing. I could not hear my lap top on an airplane.  The FiiO E5 is great.
B001PPGAJY|5.0|I am so happy that this movie was given a great Blue Ray transfer! It looks awesome as well as watching it again put me in the theatre with the feeling I had when I saw it the first time. The clarity and color tones are jumping out of the screen and the audio is up to par for the surround sound or just straight stereo!    The special features are all here from the DVD version which ROCKS! So, if you don 't have this movie yet? Get it here at Amazon for a good price.
B000LQMK2Y|5.0|Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.<br /><br />Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.<br /><br />Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.<br /><br />Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...<br /><br />I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...<br /><br />In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays!

B00005A0V0|4.0|Caravan was part of the Cantaberry prog school, which included bands like Soft Machine and Gong. Caravan was by far the most melodic of these groups.<br /><br />In fact, In The Land Of Grey and Pink has all the melody of Fragle, by Yes. Caravan did not really use a lot of free jazz or dissonence like many of their peers. Yet their tracks are long and don't always follow traditional stuctures.<br /><br />So it make take a few listens, even when you are initially grabbed by Land Of Grey and Pink's melodies and the generally happy mood of this music. But this work is not hard, and does not take long, to penatrate. Once you do, it is well worth the exploration.<br /><br />Caravan had a varried career, and if you want to get to know this band, do not collect their work in sequence. Land Of Grey and Pink is probably the most representative of their work, and so its the best starting point for this fine band.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|I have never read this author before but will be sure to read more of his work.  What a wonderful writer! What a talent!  He writes in multiple voices painting a portrait of life circling around the events occuring in 1974 when Petit walked a tightrope across the gap between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York.  But the novel isn't so much about Petit's feat as about life itself, and the City, and the way people and their histories bump up and against each other to create the ever-flowing movement of time from the present to the future.  It is about the human experience and it is luminous, even when McCann describes heroin-addicted street-walkers or a teenager searching the tunnels of the subway system for graffiti. It is rare that such gritty realism can nevertheless leave the reader feeling inspired and grateful for the full range of our human experience.

044654146X|1.0|I have been impressed with the intelligence and creativity of Jewish people and their culture almost as long as I can remember - their contributions in science and the arts have been enormous and greatly out of proportion to their population. As a student of academic achievement, I've also always been impressed at how well their youngsters perform in school - a model for most others. However, I have also seen how well the Jewish people support each other, and thus immediately am prone to not take Senor and Singer's data on Israeli VC capital intensity (eg. $2.5X/capita vs. the U.S.) at face value, especially given Israel's unconscionably selective (vs. Palestinians re citizenship) genetic population and immigration.    Despite this inherent respect for Jewish culture and genetic stock, I am extremely offended by the unstated premises of \\"Start-Up Nation\\" - that stealing Palestinian land and decades of abusing and murdering its citizens is to be somehow overlooked and excused. Then there's the $103 billion in foreign aid given Israel by the U.S., plus aid given Egypt, Jordan, and other nations conditioned on their attitude towards Israel and Jewish migration, along with U.S. loan guarantees, and legal and illegal technology transfers to Israel. Then there was the damage to the U.S. economy via the 1970s Arab Oil Embargo (retaliation against U.S. support for Israel), and the at least partial motivation of bin Laden et al to attack the U.S. because of our strong support for Israel. Some estimate the total cost of supporting Israel at $3 trillion (Thomas Stauffer). Given 9/11, the second Gulf War, the on-going war in Afghanistan, and the enhanced Homeland Security effort - I suspect the long-run cost is much greater.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This young man is absolutely incredible... We are just sorry we didn't know of him earlier. We would have been following him when he first started. With Eric Clapton's endorsement of him that sealed the deal for us... We've already purchased tickets for his March concert in our area. Joe Bonamassa is mesmerizing. And thank you Amazon for making our purchase of this incredible DVD easier, priced well and recieved quickly... an all around wonderful experience.
0439023483|2.0|I read it on a friend's recommendation.  I read the whole book even though I told my friend pretty clearly I like to read fuzzy kittens and happy puppies. She did tell me it was heavy and/or different.  I just didn't realize how heavy and how different.  I finished hoping for a good ending although how well can it end with all the carnage?  Only to find the book was just a set up for book two.  I don't know why anyone would even think this up or why anyone would want to read it.  It makes me feel like some kind of sicko for even knowing the title let alone knowing I read the whole thing.  I don't like to read about people killing each other.  I am aware of that is some form everyday.  I read to relax and forget about the fact that our teens do kill each other in the streets and for much less reason.  This book is well written with good character developement.  If you like books about kids killing each other I am sure it is great.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|This is a really good movie.  It seems to me that Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow steal the show.
B000094A6A|5.0|this movie is so funny. i love it it's just one of those nonsense films you can enjoy. I Recommend this movie for everyone :)
B000Y7ZHCU|3.0|Some songs are known and very popular (\\"Because you loved me\\")and the rest is a very average show for a viewer spoiled, for instance, with [[ASIN:B0027HBBGQ Pink]], [[ASIN:B002JM1VJG Madonna]] and [[ASIN:B000CPGZHA Kylie]] parade of sexism-on-stage.<br /><br />And documentary adds nothing to a general enjoyment, as screening a way doing princess from an ordinary-looking female was hardly entertaining for an outsider.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I don't usually review music on amazon, but I recieved this cd in the mail yesterday and can't stop listening to it! There is no feeling like disovering an album for the first time, it's like falling in love. And I am in love!It is seriously the album of the year. Every single song is so good...I can't decide which I like best. Listening to the track 'Waking Up' I was crying it was that good! Please don't put off buying this cd another day.
B00006L3S3|5.0|Even though I have idolized John Lennon since he first hit the shores of America, I think that today I appreciate his wisdom and creativity even more, especially since his music has been remastered.  This album is a perfect example.  It's been years since I listened to the entire work.  With this remastered version, I, wiser now myself, feel that I am hearing a new album.  The clarity of the sound gives these tracks a vibrant richness that I didn't notice before, and \\"everything is illuminated\\".<br /><br />For me, the tracks fall into 3 categories:  serious/meaningful, mid-tempo and solid rock.  In the first group are \\"Mind Games\\", \\"Aisumasen\\", \\"Out Of The Blue\\" and \\"You Are Here\\".  \\"Mind Games\\" is Lennon in his solo eclectic prime, incorporating inspired lyrics and a beautiful melody (\\"Loooove iiis the answer, and you know that for sure\\" gets me every time), socio-political concerns, and the influence of Yoko's philosophy and conceptual art.  \\"Aisumasen\\" has Lennon exposing his passion, guilt and love against a traditional blues background, complete with a nicely executed basic blues/rock guitar solo.  In \\"Out Of The Blue\\", he thanks \\"the Lord and Lady\\" (equality, even for gods) for the love he has found.  Allied with the cosmic lyrics (\\"Like a UFO you came to me\\") are celestial, dream-like back-up voices which comprise one of the stylistic tools of this album.  A keyboard interlude, crystal clear from the remastering, adds distinction to the track.  \\"You Are Here\\" has been dismissed by some as muzak, but to me, the metaphorical global references (\\"From Liverpool to Tokyo, what a way to go...East is east, and west is west, the twain shall meet\\") which represent John and Yoko's union, in a gentle melody which floats over smooth \\"slide\\" guitar, raise it far above the muzak level.  And then there are those ghostly back-up voices.<br /><br />Of the mid-tempo songs, \\"One Day At A Time\\" is the best.  It is enlivened by John's falsetto vocal, a bouncy chorus and those eerie back-up singers again.  \\"Intuition\\", \\"I Know\\" and \\"Only People\\" are good mid-tempo songs; a little on the light side, but they have their attractions.  Actually, \\"Intuition\\" has a touch of early Doors, which is definitely a good thing.<br /><br />The rock tracks, all strong, range from the graphic \\"Tight A$\\" (\\"just as tight as a dope fiend's fix, my friend\\"), to the politically aggressive \\"Bring On The Lucie/Freda People\\" (\\"Your time is up, you better know it\\"), to the wild abandon of \\"Meat City\\" (\\"People were dancing like there's no tomorrow\\").<br /><br />I consider \\"Mind Games\\" to be in the same league with Lennon's best - \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Imagine\\" - all 5-star albums.  By the way, the 3 bonus tracks are home versions of \\"Aisumasen\\", \\"Freda People\\" and \\"Meat City\\".  They are pretty stripped down, which does not appeal to me; but if you like things acoustic, there they are, with altered lyrics.rs again.  \\"Intuition\\", \\"I Know\\" and \\"Only People\\" are good mid-tempo songs; a little on the light side, but they have their attractions.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|My daughter recieved this doll for her birthday two years ago. She never got tired of playing with it.  My favorite feature is that it's machine washable.  It's very durable, and still cuddly.  A few months ago, she lost her baby at a swim meet.  (We hope \\"Baby\\" found a good home with another child who needed her.)  Because my daughter loved and missed this baby so much, we bought her a new one for her most recent birthday.  She is thrilled to have her baby back.  It's a great baby doll.  I highly recommend it.  Worth every penny.
B002PEP4HI|5.0|as in all his books. i found beauty. inspiration. love and tears ....a five hankie ending.  mr. albom. please never stop writing.  i am ready for the next one now.
B000A32KJQ|5.0|This is a lovely CD.  Not complex jazz, some might find it a little soft, but beautiful in its simplicity.  A little reminiscent of Garbarek's own material, or Eberhard Weber's.  Katche is excellent, colourful but subtle with no grandstanding, and the others, Garbarek, Marcilewski, Stanko etc are all having a good time.  Garbarek doesn't go out of his way but is in his usual good lyrical form, Marcilewski, not unlike Rainer Brunninghaus, keeps the harmonies coming sweetly and goes nicely with the flow, while Stanko throws in a few surprises to liven things up.  The sound quality is top-notch.  To get the most of the music's intricacies play on a good sound system and don't have distractions.
6305428042|5.0|This movie is defenitly on the top 100 list of great Halloween Films because it's awesome and a classic  this has to be my favorite Halloween movie. I Recommend this movie for everyone :)
B002MW50KO|2.0|What has happened to Dylan's voice! I really like the way Dylan has arranged these songs - plus the female chorus is very nice touch - but what has happened to Dylan's voice?? The Dylan I remember from 'Nashville Skyline' 'Blood On The Tracks' now sounds like a horse croak or Dylan's pinching his nose shut while singing. I wish he'd release this with the female vocals only.
B001CSS4V6|5.0|LOVE this movie and its amazing on Blu-ray which makes it watchable over and over again. It seems to be a rare find on blu-ray and after watching the prices for a while, I gave in and purchased it for ~$40 on Amazon.
B002OFWG7O|5.0|It has been said of the novelist Graham Greene that he is \\"the greatest novelist never to have written a great novel.\\"  With this logic, I would argue that The Foo Fighters are the Graham Greene of modern rock.  Despite, in my opinion, never releasing a truly great album, they nonetheless tower over scores of \\"mallternative\\" imitators as the greatest modern rock singles band of the last 15 years.    Over the course of individual albums, the Foos' relentless guitar assaults can seem a bit same-sounding, but in short 4 minute bursts on the radio or MTV, their best songs were transcendent, liberating anthems that showcased the best elements of classic arena rock, punk, and indie rock.  These songs exhibited a timeless catchiness that made their flavor of the week rap-metal, emo, or generic pop punk competitors sound like the boring, instantly dated amateurs that they all (mostly) were.    So for newbies, all of those guitar anthems are here in a flawless and tidy summation.  For longtime fans, the 2 new tracks are nice additions, but the real reasons to drop some cash for this package are (1) The generous and entertaining collection of videos and live performances on the bonus DVD (each one is a keeper worthy of repeat viewings.  And many are hilarious, effectively conveying Grohl and company's sense of humor) and (2) the pretty reasonable price of $13 for the whole set.  Highly recommended!

Can't believe the power it has, picking up litter from the cat box, hair, general crumbs and dirt. Sometimes I use it twice a day. It is wonderful. Lighweight and does a great job and I don't have to drag around my big, heavy sweeper or use microfibler mops which just pushes the dirt around. Would recommend it for anyone.
0545123267|5.0|This book is beautifully written, and has a wonderfully gripping storyline. I've heard so much about this book, and so I had to get a peice of the action. But... here's the secret: psst. There was very little \\"action.\\" There was a lot of talk of past events, a lot of romance, but not a lot of external conflict. Don't get me wrong, there was a lot of internal conflict (after all, will he be able to stay human or not?! Gasp!).<br /><br />The wonderful thing, though, is that it didn't matter! This book is so fantastically written that it could be about characters watching paint dry and I would be absolutely hooked.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong! Please! The story isn't boring. Not at all. This book is wonderful. Beautiful. Amazing. I love it. Seriously. That's the point of what I'm saying. :) Kapeesh?<br /><br />You won't regret buying it.
B001UE7DBY|5.0|I read this book over a year ago.  I was pleasantly surprised to see it made into a movie.  The book was well rated by the NY Times but it was hardly a best seller.  I spent my time reading this book, marveling at Mandela from lawyer, to a prisoner who charmed his captors, negotiated with the government in secret, always without malice and never lost his dignity through it all.  That was inspiring, but more so was how he brought together his country using the a World Cup Rugby Match.  You are not human if you dont find yourself crying at what he accomplished.  Mandela never had a lust for power, he ran the country and then retired.  He never used his incarcertion to get back against people.  Having Morgan Freeman playing him (the voice of God) is a particularly strong metaphor and remind us that leaders like Mandela come once in a generation.

B001SAHOBO|3.0|Let's get one thing out of the way, this is definitely one of the best choreographed Kung Fu movies of the year (at least for me!) It's good to see that Sammo Hung still has it when creating these fights!<br /><br />Let's get another thing out of the way:<br /><br />Loves: Great fights WITHOUT wires (i.e. Hate Wire-Fu)<br />Likes: Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung, Martial Arts<br /><br />Ip Man is a semi-biopic of the Wing Chun style Grand Master of the same name. The plot, well, as with many Kung Fu movies, is all about Kung Fu schools, political intrigue and... well... that's basically it! For being a biopic they don't really delve too much in Ip Man's life but more on the setting... which takes place during the Japanese Invasion (1930-ish). So, ho-hum plot, check. But we don't watch these types of movies for the plot, we watch them for the action and this one delivers! I believe this movie tested Donnie Yen's mastery of martial arts more than any other movie before this one because I'm sure he had to get the Wing Chun fights done right and on most of them he did! Now, if you are thinking: \\"why did this guy only gave the movie 3 stars?\\" If you are going to buy this DVD, DON'T DO IT!!! First look at the Product Detail section of the page and notice the following:<br /><br />Studio: Bonzai<br /><br />NEVER BUY A BONZAI MEDIA MOVIE!!<br />These guys are just bootleggers (they are part of Red SUN DVDs if I'm not mistaken!) So basically the DVD quality is a joke! You are better of buying the original Region 2 discs! The video quality is so bad, it appears that they ripped it from the original disc at a lower quality (looks like a badly made Divx/Xvid rip!). Audio is not that good either. So Don't buy THIS version but DO buy the movie if you like martial arts, like Donnie Yen and want to watch one of the best ass kicking movies
B0026P3G12|5.0|12/4/09    I absolutely love this cd by Susan Boyle!    You know how you buy a cd and maybe a couple of songs you truly enjoy but the rest you just press the skip button. Not so with I DREAMED A DREAM. Every song is good and so uplifting. I was sitting in my car waiting for the bank to open this AM and spent 15 enjoyable minutes marinating in this very uplifting cd. Each song touched my spirit/soul in some way and brought about so many happy memories. Her music definitely moved me on many levels. Looking forward to listening over and over again until yet another cd comes out by this newly discovered talented artist Susan Boyle.    Peg  Pasadena, Ca.
1595141979|5.0|I think out of all four of the Vampire Academy series right now, Shadow Kiss is the one that will make you wanting more. Well all of them will make you wanting more. In shadow kiss it has everything from strigoi to Rose and Dimitri's love. Its just a wonderful book to read and you won't regret reading it! I loved this book and found myself reading it all in less then a day. I just couldn't let go off this book. My mom calls me crazy nowadays for reading too much of these Vamp books, because every time I get to a part that I think is funny, I would start smiling or laugh out loud and my family would just look at me like I'm going insane. There isn't really a good way of reviewing a book, because sometimes to one person what is good can be bad or horrible for someone else. Different people have their own opinions on what they think is good or not. And for me I just loved this book. I mean series. If whoever of you out there are asking yourself if you should pick this book up and read it, then I say heck go for it. Because thats what I did and I enjoyed it a lot. I should say screw the reviews and read the synopsis of the book and see if you have that vibe that it might be interesting to you. Thats all I can say haha xD But anyways, its a great book! =]
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Very exciting and well thought out storyline and  cast in this next story of the caped crusader... Although one has to ask why did they cast Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel? Although I loved her and Will Farrell in Stranger than Fiction.. she was edgy and sarcastic... and paired with Farrell worked well... this is just like Superman the original movie casting Christopher Reeve with Margot Kidder as Lois Lane... Probably the biggest upset to date on Superhero pairing...lol.. Come on guys these guys deserve the Hottest girl alive... but loved the movie..
B002SF9Y8E|1.0|What a bowl-ringer of an album. Where does one start? Bob has a voice like a fart. I can see Rudolph's nose turn green after one listen. Santa turned the sleigh around and went home. Barbara Streisand's Xmas Album is like Sgt. Pepper compared to this. Hendrix dies and this schmuck continues to record? Jingle bowels.    Jesus Christ, I feel like climbing up on a cross after one listen. It's a new genre, Xmas Torture Music.
B00004YZFR|4.0|Do you want to watch a concert film or a movie about a really poorly executed concert that lead to a bad vibe and murder?  You don't get enough of either in this film.  The concert footage is remarkable - Mick Jagger is on fire and Mick Taylor is  . . . maybe 20.  As to Altamont - this film makes everyone who put it together look like a jerk - including the film makers (is this a snuff film because they show the murder (sorry to give away the ending - TWICE).  Putting on a concert for over 100,000 over a weekend - don't think so.  Hiring a gang for security - not too smart.  Add annoying hippies (really annoying hippies)- disaster.  At the end of the day, Sonny Barger has the voice of reason - go figure.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|Just thought I'd share a little further series info.  Maverick was originally created as a starring vehicle for James Garner.  The quality in the writing and performances is self-evident, but the negative consequences with 50's production methods were that the show quickly fell behind schedule while shooting the first episodes.  It was for that reason that Jack Kelly was brought in, so two units could work simultaneously.  Though Garner and Kelly reportedly got along famously, it was one of the sources of resentment for Garner that led him to jump ship in 1960 during a writers strike.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I love this set, and I recommend it to any fan of P. G. Wodehouse.  Purists should know that these episodes do not adhere strictly to Wodehouse's plots.  The producers have taken some liberties with the story-lines, for the sake of T.V. time constraints.  All the same, these productions satisfy completely.  I wish Hugh Laurie would learn to stop slurping when he talks; but, otherwise, he delivers a perfect Bertie Wooster.  (Maybe Bertie slurped when he talked, too?)  Of course, Stephen Fry was born to play Jeeves, and few living actors could have done so better.  All of the episodes in this set appear to take place in the 1920s, and it astonishes me how the producers re-created that time period on film.  They even dug up some old footage of Times Square in New York for those episodes set on this side of the pond.  (I noticed that some of the stories that Wodehouse set in England got transferred over here, but they still work fine.)  Buy this set if you love silliness.
B000002P6R|4.0|Well The Who were faced with a bad crisis with the death of Keith Moon who was one of the driving forces of the band.  The Who were forever changed by this and it was definetly reflected in their music. The band hired former Faces drummer Kenny Jones to be in the band and in 1981 the band went into the studio to record the first album without him.  Face Dances was the result and while this is not a classic Who album like the first 7 are it's still a very good album.  The album starts off with the bands hit single You Better You Bet.  This is a really good rock song with a good sing along chorus.  This also has some pretty humorous lyrics to it.  Next is Don't Let Go The Coat and is my favorite song on the album.  This is a nice grooving song which also has a very join in chorus.  One of my very favorite Who songs. Cache Cache is a pretty cool song with weird lyrics about a bear pit and how there won't be any bears.  Symbolic lyrics on this one.  The Quiet One is John's first of two songs he contributes on here and he sings this one.  A really good arena rocker with raspy vocals from John singing about how everyone identifies him as the quiet member of the band.  There is also a live version of this song as a bonus track.  Did You Steal My Money is a weak song on the album.  The lyrics sound pretty silly and are not some of Townshends greatest.  How Can You Do It Alone is also very poor.  This one sounds somewhat draggy and doesen't have any real bite to it.  Daily Records is where the album picks up again and has a nice verse part and then the drum part changes for the chorus.  Good lyrics on this song.  You is the second of the John Entwistle song and this one is song by Roger.  Pretty good song but not one of my favorites on here.  Kind of has a very 80s rock sound.  Another Tricky Day closes the album which is a pretty good groving song with some synthesizer. This edition features bonus unreleased tracks which i won't go into because none of them really stood outto me.  All in all I really like this album and is probably my favorite of the post Moon albums.  The cover art is great as well with 12 different portaits of the four band members by 12 different artists.  I recomend this album for people who are not as familiar with the post Moon years but if people are new to The Who this is definetly not the best place to start.  new commers I think should start with Tommy, Who's Next or The Who Sell Out then work their way to this one.  Good effort from The Who.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I'm a long time Sting fan and I can't even understand what the heck he is saying on most of the songs.  Is this a new style of singing?  I liked maybe two songs.  Other then Soul Cake, the first half of the album would be best as just instrumental for mood/background music.  I like when artists are artistic but c'mon.
B000002HH9|1.0|When I started getting really into The Cure and buying there albums it was druing 2000's Bloodflowers but had liked them ever since I first saw them on MTV when I was about 6 or 7.  I kept hearing bad reviews about this album and how many Cure fans absolutley hate it.  It made me real curious to hear it and I found a use copy in the store and bought it.  I now see what everyone was talking about with this album.  It's way too pop and the music and lyrics sound bland and just downright cheesy.  This is the first album with the line up of Smith/Bamonte/Gallup/O'Donnel/Cooper and this would continue through 2004's The Cure.  This was a real bad direction for the band and I'm curious as to what state of mind Robert was in when he wrote these songs.  The album starts off good with Want which I first heard played live on a bootleg cd I have from the Bloodflowers tour.  This one is pretty good with lush sounding guitars andnice drum work how Robert feels he wants more of everything and excess has gotten to him.  Club America is very brit pop sounding and very un Cure like.  To me this sounds like a Blur song and I hate Blur.  Robert sings the whole song with a low tone in his voice and things get much worse from here.  This Is A Lie is a boring mellon collie song with strings and it makes me really wish the song would finish to go on to the next one.  The 13th is the albums first single and I thought this was a real odd choice for a first single.  It's very loungey sounding with brass horns and bongos and nothing at all like The Cure.  Strange Attraction is next and to me this is so bad it's embarrasing.  This is probably the worst Cure song ever.  it starts out with a string arrangement the gets into a dance pop song which sounds like something Amy Grant would do in the 90s or maybe Debbie Gibson in the 80s.  Mint Car is the second single from the album and is just boring.  it's upbeat but the music and the lyrics really sound flat.  Jupiter Crash I have heard was the onesong from this album that many Cure fans who hated this album liked.  My ex girlfriend even liked this song and she is a big Cure fan but I can't see why.  The song is acoustic with and very mellow and boring.  I really couldn't get into it at all.  Round & Round & Round is silly sounding to me with bad lyrics and is very forgetable like most of the album.  Gone is a slow song with a piano and bass part with keyboards thrown in and sounds to me kind of like some detective tv show setting song.  No real life in it and is not one I can really get into.  Numb is another boring and lifeless song along with Return which once listning to them my attention span wanders away.  After a bunch of awful songs we get into Trap which is a song I happen to like.  It's a god pop rock song which is not a great Cure song but it's better then alot of what is on here and after having to sit through a bunch of really bad songs you're happy to get Trap on.  Treasure again boring and slow.  Not much to talk about with this one.  The album closes with Bare which just might be the most boring song on here.  It's slow, boring and too long.  It clocks in at 7 and 1/2 minutes.  This album is a real let down for The Cure discography.  I will probably never listen to it again because it is just to horrible.  I find it either too pop or too boring.  I've heard this is one of Robert's favorite albums but I can't see why.  These songs are seriously really really bad.  Fortunutly The Cure got it right again on their next album Bloodflowers so Robert still had some good songs left in him.  They were just nowhere to be found on here.  People new to The Cure who want to get into them don't get this album.  Not even out of curiosity.  This album is just for the die hard fans who have to have it for the collection.  If you start here I'm afraid you might get the wrong impression of The Cure.  The Cure are way better then this.  In my opinion they are one of the greatest bands ever but you wouldn't thinkthat with this album.  Starting recomendations early Cure.  Seventeen Seconds, Faith, Pornography.  Skip this one all together.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|Amazingly, what we have here is an `exercise in reverse'...<br /><br />Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, we have quite a successful group of singers born bread and trained there, aspiring to take the world's centre operatic stage; those include  in no particular order: Vesselina Kasarova (Mezzo-soprano/alto), Elina Garanca (Mezzo-soprano), Dimitri Hvosostovsky (Baritone), Anna Netrebko (Soprano), Angela Georgiou (Soprano), and not to forget the forerunners of those artists, the magnificent Elena Obraztsova (Mezzo-soprano), the superb Ghena Dimitrova (soprano), the great NIcolai Ghiaurov (Bass), and more.<br />All of these artists which initially were trained in the former Soviet Union schools of music, took to the Italian and French repertoire - and here was the `straight forward exercise' which they took upon themselves; to try (to various degree of success) to overcome their inherent Slavonic culture-of-the-voice, and without the hinder of the Slavonic trained singing voice to shine in the Italian and French repertoire...True, many of them got their voices trained farther with Italian and French singing teachers later on in their fledgling careers.<br /><br />The `exercise in reverse' now, is, that two of the greatest western cultured operatic voices, born, bread and trained in the best of the Italian and French culture tradition of the voice, namely, Ramon Vargas (tenor) and Renee Fleming (lyric soprano) would dive nose down into the core of the Russian operatic repertoire - Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin...<br /><br />Right from the start there is a magnificent sense of correctness in the way by which Renee Fleming<br />enters the scene as a the romantic teenager, expressing her lines in pure Russian diction and pure lyric-vocal-tone and with the right Russian syllables.<br />From there on, Tatiana becomes Renee Faming - and Renee flaming on stage becomes Tchaikovsky's and Pushkin's Tatiana...<br />Most rendering is the `letter aria': this is a complete encompassing scene that demands a command of the singing voice, expressiveness and an amazing ability to act - all of which is greatly fulfilled by Renee Fleming.

B002OB9KPE|5.0|I want to preface this review with a statement that I consider [[ASIN:B00004RDJ1 SMPT:e]] and [[ASIN:B00005PJ9V Bridge Across Forever]] to be two of the absolute finest 3rd Wave Prog albums ever, if not the best.     The Whirlwind is an absolutely wonderful album which contains some excellent pieces of music; the main disc and bonus disc are both worth the purchase. There are many who will extol the great virtues of this band and album, but I'd like to take a moment to point out the only real flaws with it--and if you already know who and what Transatlantic are and are looking at reviews of the product, you're probably looking to see what the criticisms of it are or just want to troll people with differing opinions.     The album is less an amalgam of these artists' styles with a hint of The Beatles, as SMPT:e and Bridge were, and more a collaboration of artists who just felt like working together again. There are moments when listening through the album where I think, \\"That's a Morse song/segment,\\" and \\"That's a Stolt song/segment,\\" because their style is so blatantly obvious; there were very few moments like that throughout the previous works. This doesn't take away from the music, as it's still Morse and Stolt music, but it does make the album feel lesser than the previous efforts if only because it lacks the originality of those. I don't know if it's possible to dislike Morse and like this album, and the same for The Flower Kings to a much lesser extent; I believe it was possible to like neither The Kings or Neal Morse/Spock's Beard and still like SMPT:e and/or Bridge.     The only other criticism I could have with this album is the CCM feel, though it is substantially less overt than in Neal's solo work--which I haven't really followed since [[ASIN:B000BI1YJW ?]], in part because of that. I can accept spiritual concepts in music, but when it gets to the point of being worship music, I'm out. The only part of this album where the CCM feel was overly much is thelast track, sans Whirlwind theme reprisal; so much so that I edited the version I ripped to my computer in to two separate tracks, and routinely skip Dancing With Eternal Glory. To each their own, though.     The rest of Disc 1 is excellent. Sure, it has it's ups and downs, but it's ups prevail. Disc 2, however, is excellent; I would go so far as to say I almost prefer disc 2. I believe Spinning steals the entire album; it feels like something straight off one of their first albums, with some great hooks and, though obviously written by Roine, it doesn't feel like a Flower Kings song or anything I've heard on any of his solo albums. Getting to see Pete take the reins on a song is also a welcome piece; Lending a Hand is a clear departure from the rest of the album, but it does feel like it has a heavy Beatles influence to it, which allows it fit right in with the rest of the Transatlantic portfolio. The covers are all excellent; great selection of songs to cover, great performances of them. Who doesn't enjoy a cover of 'Hogweed?     Overall, great album. Not the best by these guys, but, really, that's like saying [[ASIN:B0025KVLTC Revolver]] wasn't The Beatles best album--it doesn't really say much considering its competition. Sure, I consider this is the least impressive Transatlantic offering, but Revolver isn't anything to scoff at, and neither is The Whirlwind.

Everything on the sparsely decorated stage is functional and has its purpose (a rare phenomenon with modern staging).<br /><br />The stage illumination too has a clear un-exaggerated function which greatly contributes to the filming and details that the cameras capture (this is no half shading `camera obscura' - the way some Blu-ray is made; in semi darkness...)<br /><br />The sound recording is as perfect as it gets - it capture the orchestral sound and dynamics and the singers voices in a greatly focused proportional way and with a frequency range that is clear, extended - in the best of the Decca tradition.<br /><br />The conducting, the tempi, the breath and pause, is a marvel:<br />What a great conductor we find here for the Metropolitan Orchestra and the Tchaikovsky score in thefigure of Valery Gergiev...!<br /><br />The Tchaikovsky musical theme are quite known and melodic - the lines are easy to memorize, but it might take the novice to Tchaikovsky's operas and the manner by which Tchaikovsky takes to the singing voice score and orchestra, a second hearing/viewing of this DVD - just to get it all to sink-in and enjoy.<br /><br />No doubts that this is one of the very best (possibly THE VERY BEST) of the Blu-ray DVD opera as yet; One of a great stage production, singing, sound - all in all, a marriage of the best possible assemblage of artists which gives meaning to it all.<br />The `exercise in reverse' - courtesy of the Metropolitan Opera House, is a mile-stone.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|The sad news that a-ha have decided to throw in the towel after the completion of their current tour is offset by the release of one the greatest albums they've ever produced.  I have been a fan of theirs since '86 and though they have released some great and not so great albums this one stands out among the pack.  Foot Of The Mountain equals what I consider to be their best album ever...Scoundrel Days.  Every song is amazing but it does take a bit of time to get into everything.  I have listened to few other albums since its release.<br /><br />The standout tracks for me are Riding The Crest, Foot Of The Mountain, Mother Nature Goes To Heaven and, oddly enough, Start The Simulator.  Others reviewing this album may disagree with my last choice. It's a mesmerizing track and the perfect closer for this album.  I can't recommend this album enough if you are a fan of their work.  Few bands can say that their 'curtain call' album was as amazing as this one and I hope they recondsider their decision down the road.
B00003CX7L|5.0|I like Toy Story and I like Toy Story 2 also.  My 3 year old grandson loves Toy Story 2.  He has Buzz, Woody and Jessie and brings them over to our house almost every day.  The action in the movie keeps him watching and he has his favorites and I have my favorites. (Rex)  There is some humor that the little ones don't pick up on but the adults will  :)  Disney puts out some good movies.  Oh, I bought the VHS instead of the dvd because it was a LOT less expensive!
159448385X|5.0|Love this story!  I've read both this novel and the author's first book Kite Runner.  I truly enjoyed the Kite Runner, but was even more delighted by A thousand Spledid Suns.  The stories captured my attention from page one. I became very interested in how the two woman's lives were going to cross.  The book explores the emotions of love, sadness, abuse ... so many other emotions I cant even capture. I found myself wanting to finish so I could know what happened next, but sad as I got closer to the end because I didnt want the story to end.

B00003CXA6|4.0|I bought the video at the Gettysburg battlefield bookstore after touring it with a friend and a very knowledgeable guide.    I'm only 1 hr into the movie, but am already learning a lot.  For example, I didn't realise all those impressive beards we see in ancient photographs were fake.  I assumed they were real, but I guess I missed the detail in the grainy pictures.    The only minuses so far, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the speeches the officers give (and there have been a couple of doosies) seem a bit too long and rehearsed for having happened on the spot, during a battle.  Also, the soldiers seem a bit too chipper, running past and kneeling next to dead bodies as if they weren't...  dead bodies.  I mean, if I had a dead body next to me, I'd be kinda bothered by it.      PS!  My friend insists the they grew real, natural beards back in the 1860s and that the beards in the movie are supposed to look real.  But there's no way that's possible.  No conscious human being could possibly have expected any other conscious human being to think they're realistic.

B002P7UCMC|1.0|After all the wait, Rammstein released the biggest turd possible. At least on past Rammstein albums you were pretty much guaranteed 6 great songs. This album has not one single song that stands out. Every song is boring and quite bland. IF you love easy listening music, this disc would be great for you. I can't imagine a single song from this album played live.<br />Do yourself a favor, if you love Rammstein as much as I do, DO NOT BUY THIS DISC.
0345472322|1.0|Thankfully, this book is a quick read. Dweck makes an interesting and compelling point but you'd be better off finding a similar 1 page article somewhere on the web.   Here's one:[...]  I thought that the workshop chapter would go into some more detail. But it was mostly about the praise that Dweck gets for the workshop she sets up! I call that chutzpah.  Dweck makes the same point about 1,357 times.     And oh, the near constant bragging is very annoying. Good thing she got a position at Stanford; she's going to fit right in with the Palo Alto folks.
B000ION79Y|2.0|TWO STARS FOR ATTACK FARCE!!!    I'm a Steven Seagal fan, but this movie is so pathetic and sad!!! Absolutely no action at all!!! Seagal's lines are dubbed which stinks and the fight scenes are in slow motion. Avoid this Seagal movie like the plague!!! The only good thing in the film is the hot chick who kills people. Even when the killers murder people - the action is slowed down which means that it did not take place at all because we never actually see anyone get cut up!     The acting is terrible which is why Attack Farce is a complete joke! This film is more like a comedy man! I always laugh when I hear someone else dubbing Seagal's lines!!! lol. It is always halarious to hear different people do Seagal's lines & the people sound absolutely nothing like him!!!    This movie is a complete waste of time. I was fast forwarding most of the time. The final \\"fight\\" scene is so weak and lame.    Avoid this Seagal disaster and check out his better films such as: The Keeper, Out Of Reach, Kill Switch, Urban Justice, and Pistol Whipped.    TWO STARS FOR ATTACK FARCE!!!
B000FWHVKA|4.0|The first song on Silent Shout is a contender for the best dance single of the decade. It takes many cues from Underworld's 1993 classic [[ASIN:B000003RGL Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]: the sparse production, the gradual build-up, and even the bass line recall \\"Dark And Long.\\" The Knife's fascination with vocal distortion also owes a lot to Underworld. However, the song doesn't just recreate the basic sound of nineties techno, it also recreates the focus on original, catchy rhythms and vocal lines. The keyboard lead in \\"Silent Shout\\" is incredible. The rhythm is distinctive, very easy to remember, but quite complex, with a lot of variation in the basic pattern. I can't think of any band of the 2000s that managed to come up with an original musical phrase of this length -- the music of the 2000s tends to focus on extremely basic loops.    The title track also has subtle shifts in dynamics. Toward the end, the main keyboard line gains a louder and sharper sound, the individual notes start to blur together as if the music is about to fall apart into noise. But instead, there's a break, the turbulence quickly dies down, and ghostly echoes appear in the outro.    The album as a whole is a bit less brilliant, but still immensely enjoyable. The composition is firmly rooted in the song-oriented style of the early nineties, which brings out the originality of the songwriting. Karin Dreijer's vocal style was probably inspired by [[ASIN:B000002HPV Bjork's]] (the same heavily-accented dissonance), but Bjork never thought to warp her own voice the way Dreijer does in \\"The Captain.\\" She comes on suddenly, after a long, [[ASIN:B0009NSDQG Autechre]]-like ambient intro; the distortion renders the lyrics unintelligible and makes her voice sound like the call of some shrill, wild bird. There is a certain triumphant, predatory tinge in the vocal rhythm. You'd think they were singing about war instead of sea captains.    In many songs, the lyrics appear to express some kind of oblique, vaguefeminism. \\"Neverland\\" is apparently about a high-end call girl who coldly regards her clients, \\"One Hit\\" appears to mock traditional ideas of gender roles, and \\"Forest Families\\" seems to be about how a young woman feels stifled growing up in a provincial town where adults \\"said my favourite book was dirty, and 'you should not show you can read.'\\" I say \\"seems\\" because most of the lyrics are indirect, and often suffer from Bjork syndrome, where awkward metaphors and grammatical mistakes are passed off as an original way of expression. For instance, \\"From Off To On\\" bothers me a bit, since it uses such an earnestly sentimental delivery (and a demonstratively childlike melody, which I'm pretty sure they lifted from some old Russian children's LP or other) to say such lines as, \\"we want happiness back, we want control of our bodies\\" (is that really such a problem in contemporary Sweden?), followed by, \\"I had a dream about deleting and killer whales.\\" But that's just me; Bjork fans will be all over this.    What appeals to me more is the album's tight sense of the dramatic, something it shares with early Underworld. \\"Forest Families\\" is sort of a simpler version of \\"Silent Shout,\\" with the same type of worried keyboard line. But, whatever one may think of the lyrics, when Dreijer intones, \\"music tonight / I just want your music tonight\\" in the chorus, that really captures the frustrated young person's desperation. \\"Marble House\\" has a swooning, colossal chorus. The verses and music aren't anything special, but when the distorted falsetto starts warbling the rhythm of the chorus, it's pure pop heaven. \\"Neverland\\" sounds as icy as its subject, and when Dreijer hoarsely repeats \\"the money burns in my hand,\\" it creates a haunting sense that the protagonist is about to snap under the pressure.    There are only three songs where I don't care for the music: \\"We Share Our Mothers' Health,\\" \\"Like A Pen\\" and \\"One Hit.\\" All three songs are much less melodic than the rest of the album, and use a jagged analog drum-and-bass rhythm section similar to Aphex Twin's [[ASIN:B000EHRAXY Chosen Lords]]. \\"One Hit\\" is the best of the three, since the lyrics are pretty funny, but none of them can boast anything in the way of melody. In my view, that's the only reason to give the album a less-than-perfect score.    Overall, though, this is without question one of the five or ten best albums of the decade. It's the first electronic album of the 2000s to really go back and relearn the lessons of the early nineties, but instead of merely imitating the classics, it uses them to emphasize new, creative musical ideas. In particular, the first three tracks are extremely strong, and make one feel like one is experiencing something completely new and unheard-of. If the entire album doesn't quite meet that standard, that's only because it's a really high standard.
B001UV4XUG|3.0|Good B movie, my ex girlfriend comes to life in this one. I could have wrote my story myself but he beat me and wrote this movie. Missing the giveaway of her actually being with someone else or maybe I have to watch it again. Not easy to watch as a movie and way too long.
0375842209|5.0|Please do not be discouraged to read this book because it's labeled Young Adult.  It is a very great read, told from the perspective of Death during Nazi Germany.  It's interesting to read from the point of view of a \\"Nazi\\" family during this time in history.  Great character development - you grow to really care for these people and their relationships with each other (especially Papa and Rudy).  The author forshadows in such a way that tells what's going to happen, but doesn't take away or ruin the story.  This is a book that is hard to put down once it's started.
B0014XCMVM|1.0|This is a review of the sound quality only, not the music.<br /><br />I think this could have been a beautiful and powerful record.  Unfortunately, the mastering guy was told to make it as loud as possible.  So large portions of the album suffer from mastering induced distortion and clipping from brutal dynamic range compression.  There is a whole generation of music that is being damaged for no other reason than they want it to be as loud as possible so it's not quiet on someone's ipod.  Look at 'loudness war' at wikipedia or google it.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure why artists want this type of processing applied to their music.  If I had labored and sweated over an album I would want it presented in the best possible way, especially if I was already rich like Alanis.  But instead they intentionally harm the sound because they think people don't know how to use the volume button, or volume normalization/replaygain.  I cannot help but think that if an industry puts out an intentionally inferior product, fewer people will buy it.  And so I wonder if the downturn in the music industry over the last decade is just because of p2p.<br /><br />And this version will most likely be the only one we get to hear as this record is not a likely candidate for a mofi type remastering.  C'est la vie.
0060254920|4.0|This book, \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" is perfect for young boys with their vivid imaginations.  My two grandsons love it and want me to read it over and over again.    This book satisifies their need for adventure stories and teaches moral lessons at the same time without them even realizing it.
B00004RHZU|4.0|One Christmas morning in 2001, I awoke to find both this CD and [[ASIN:B00005RFAI Missundaztood]] under the tree. I listened to them both and while I liked this one, I loved M!ssundaztood. While the latter remained one of my favorite albums of all time, this one eventually got lost and forgotten. I had forgotten most of what the songs sounded like, so when I heard that this was an R&B album (my favorite genre), I decided to find another copy and listen to it again.    I finally got another copy. I listened to it and loved it. While it's still no \\"M!ssunderstood,\\" I still really enjoyed it. It is a very good R&B debut. Her lyrics are still as clever as ever. Well, the ones that she has a writing credit on anyway. Probably my favorite line in the whole CD is in \\"Hell Wit Ya\\" as she sings \\"I hear I've met the wench before.\\" Even more clever lyrics are sung in \\"Split Personality\\" where she sings about having, well, a split personality.    Production highlights are in \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" and \\"Hiccup.\\" One of the two ballads, \\"Stop Falling,\\" sounds a little like \\"Crystal Ball\\" from Funhouse, but not as pretty (even though it still is pretty). There is one problem though, the album is edited. It is most notable in \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" and \\"There You Go.\\" But the tunes are so catchy that it won't even matter.
0743298039|1.0|Way not a fan of the ending. The only reason I bought it was because it was recommended to me by Amazon, after reading \\"the shadow of the wind.\\" Don't waste your money on this crap, it was torture turning the pags because it was so obvious what was going to happen next.
1906694176|5.0|This trilogy is so good I simply could not wait for the U.S. release of the third book.  I ordered it from Amazon UK. Several of my friends have read all three books and are of the same opinion. The suspense, unique characters and outstanding writing make these books among the best I have ever read, especially in the mystery genre.  We can all mourne the loss of Stieg Larrson and only imagine the pleasure we might have had if he had been able to write more books.
B0012GMUOU|3.0|Jeff Beck may not be the possessed virtuoso that is Jimi Hendrix or the gifted composer/producer that is Jimmy Page, but he is one of the finest musical artists of our time. JB has created some of the most astounding, original rock sounds to blast off that British Isle. I can hear you hard core Beck fans screaming that Jimmy Page stole his act from Jeff, but c'mon. Page took what he borrowed from JB and transfomed it into his very own grand dark celtic blues rock sound. They were BOTH stealing from the same original American music.<br /><br />So this particular Jeff Beck album is a lot more of that familiar incredible guitar sound, so smooth and hot, but laid over and wrapped around some neat new beats and rhythms. It's great to hear Beck still exploring new sounds, and some of these are even pretty good, but some are not so great. A few, like, \\"Porc-U-Pine\\", \\"Hot Rod Honeymoon\\", and \\"Pay Me No Mind\\" are more than a little corny. \\"My Thing\\" just escapes being tedious, thanks only to Jeff's guitar. On the other hand \\"So What\\", \\"Plan B\\", \\"Trouble Man\\", and \\"Grease Monkey\\" are all radical good fun. Very tight and satisfying beats. \\"Seasons\\", \\"Jb's Blues\\", \\"Bulgaria\\", and \\"Why Lord Oh Why?\\" are all beautiful, sublime, delicate slow tempo blues ballads that resonate with the forty plus years of performance history that is Jeff's soul.<br /><br />Jeff doesn't need me or anyone else to hype his talent to the unaware masses, he's done just fine in the twisted, evil music game. So I'm not going to worry about maybe discouraging anyone from checking out this disc; if you're already a Jeff Beck fan then you know about this CD, and if you're not, then there are much better ones to check out. Like \\"Wired\\", for instance, which is one of the top 25 rock albums of the 20th century.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I love Sting and his music, but this album I played once and it was enough.  I do not like the arrangements and depression that this music puts you in.  I think that he should have left this album behind somewhere.  Maybe better luck next time.
B001F12J48|4.0|this is a great holiday movie, beautiful animation, color and detail. the 3D feautre is not that great, when you put the 3D glasses on, that are supplied with the dvd, the perception of images is not good at all, you can see red and green glow around the images, even with the curtains closed and lights dimmed in the room. I think it looks more 3D and realistic while watching the 2D version. Over all great movie, but do not bother with the 3D.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|First off, I think the direction that Abrams and his team took this movie was original and well thought out. They didn't try to redo the original series story. They didn't attempt to add something completely new. They took a path that was destined to bring adoration by some and hatred by others, the \\"What If\\" path. Most of this was done well. There are a few plot holes and some of the variations were a little too much (Uhoura and Spock? Now thats what I call a forced romance, and a weird one at that). Most of the cast fits and performs well (except the Chekov kid, is he like 14?). The special affects are amazing (a lot of people are bashing the CGI...seriously? its the 21st century and this is a sci-fi movie, id love to see someone try to build miniatures for this flick, good luck).   Overall this movie was extremely entertaining and a unique twist on the classic Trek storyline and I think thats what it was supposed to be. I grew up during the turn of the melenium but my Dad loved the original series and had all of them on VHS. I loved the show and never watched any of the later series. We both enjoyed this movie because we never thought they were trying to add it to the \\"Cannon of Trek\\". Hard-core trekkies are destined to hate this movie and should probably just avoid it (which I can understand) but if you are new to the Star Trek universe or are just looking for an eye-popping action/scifi movie than star trek will make your day.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|Like most of them, Disney's second feature-length animated film has a subtle moral: if a child will honor his parents, go faithfully to school, tell the truth, and above all avoid temptation to do wrong, what he most longs for will someday be his.  The old woodcarver Geppetto (Christian Rub) lives in a picturesque little village in the Italian Alps, alone except for his tuxedo kitten Figaro and goldfish Cleo, creating beautiful toys and wondrous mechanical clocks and music boxes.  Not till he makes the marionette he calls Pinocchio does he realize how much he longs for more.  So, when the brilliant Wishing Star appears outside his bedroom window, he asks to have the puppet become \\"a real boy.\\"  And because he has brought so much joy to so many through his work, the Blue Fairy (Evelyn Venable) descends from the star to grant his desire.  She brings Pinocchio to life--but he's still made of wood.  \\"Prove yourself brave, truthful, and unselfish, and some day you will be a real boy,\\" she promises, recruiting the wandering cricket Jiminy (Cliff Edwards) to be his conscience.  Pinocchio (Dickie Jones) wants to do well, but his utter innocence soon gets him into trouble.  First he's dazzled by the tales of \\"Honest John\\" the ne'er-do-well Fox (Walter Catlett) about the charms of the theatrical life and sold to the puppetmaster Stromboli (Charles Judels), who sees him as a cash cow (\\"the only marionette...completely without the aid of strings!\\") and imprisons him in a birdcage.  When the Fairy frees him, he again falls in with John and is hustled off to Pleasure Island, where \\"stupid little boys\\" can indulge themselves in food, tobacco, beer, pool, dice, fighting, and destruction to their hearts' content--but at a price: they transform into donkeys and are sold as such by the sinister Coachman.  Escaping with Jiminy's help, half-transformed, he makes his way back to Geppetto's shop, only to find that the old man and his pets have gone off to search for him and been swallowedby the infamous sperm whale, Monstro.  Now the two must venture under the sea to search for the missing ones.    Though not as musically rich as some Disney films, this one still includes at least two memorable numbers (\\"An Actor's Life for Me\\" and the classic \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\").  The kitten Figaro is among the best animal characters of the studio's long history--sometimes jealous, sometimes affectionate, and sometimes a mirror of Geppetto's moods.  (Watch for his kitten-sized bed and high chair.)  And Pinocchio and Jiminy, once they get on the same page, make a formidable team.  The undersea sequences are to my mind the highpoints of the movie, though Pleasure Island comes in a close second.  And while it isn't a fully accurate adaptation of Collodi's original [[ASIN:B0023W6HTQ The Adventures of Pinocchio]], it's still a recognized classic and one that every kid should see.
B0026P3G12|1.0|After listening via my computer on Amazon's website to each of the songs in their 29-second allotments, I am not even going to bother buying this CD. I LOVE SUSAN BOYLE, HER SINGING IS SPECTACULAR, I THINK SHE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SINGERS ON THE PLANET, BUT--whoever \\"arranged\\" this album didn't have a clue of how to orchestrate her talents to the best of their shining qualities! I hope Susan will take control of her own career--she doesn't need Simon Cowell! She just needs a truly talented producer to help her produce the album that will glorify and support her voice to its highest potential. Susan is a stunning stage performer and this album in no way displays her true talents. SO DISAPPOINTED... I WOULD'VE ORDERED SEVERAL COPIES, but the arrangements on this CD are truly an embarrassment and a letdown. The whole thing puts you to sleep!

0743289684|5.0|It's an incredible life story in its own right, but the power of the book lies in its exposure of Islam Fundamentalism. How are we to wage war on terrorists if we don't understand the basic cultural drivers behind regimes in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and many other Arab and African Muslim countries. This book was stunning and powerful and radically changed my positions on freedom of religion and my general 'live and let live.' philosophy. There are indeed abhorrent ideas, and we should do everything in our power to stand up to them.

B002HK9HR8|3.0|Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private eye with a nose for trouble. Roman Polanski (current felon, but we won't go there) directed what many see as one of his masterpieces of cinema back in 1974. Jack definitely channels Bogart with some Raymond Chandler and some hard-boiled detective action.<br /><br />The film does not lack from interest --- the mystery gets deeper and deeper and just when you think you have the story figured out, another twist. But how many times can I watch Gittes climb a chain link fence? And the cameo of Polanski as a thug made no sense at all to the story. Who was this gangster working for? What's the relationship with some of the men he tangles with? What's the relation between the farmers and Faye Dunaway's character?<br /><br />Odd, insightful and looong. Rather than watch a neo-noir film, take in a Maltese Falcon or the Big Sleep! For what it does, Chinatown does succeed as a murder mystery in 1930s LA. But my heart belongs to Bogie.<br /><br />The DVD had some good features though; interviews with Roman Polanski and crew was fascinating.
B0026P3G12|4.0|To call Susan Boyle's [[ASIN:B0026P3G12 I Dreamed A Dream]] the 'second coming' would be an undisputed overstatement.  However, the reason why a release by a 48-year old woman could spark such triumph in album sales puzzled me.  Nothing on I Dreamed A Dream is something that radio would dare play - so how can an album by an unlikely singer sale 700,000 copies in one week, beating out more commercial bets let Adam Lambert or Rihanna?  Here's the answer.  Boyle's story is not only touching and sincere, but also her voice and the vocal style she portrays hearkens back to an older time, something that there is a bigger audience of people for than one would expect.  Sure, Boyle was a huge youtube sensation, but besides that, in the bigger spectrum of things, it wasn't that long ago when people like Charlotte Church were extremely popular and definitely 'went against the grain'.  More recently, these 'throwback', pure vocal acts like Josh Groban, Andrea Bocelli, and on the jazz side of things Michael Bubl&eacute;, Harry Connick, Jr., and the most recent Barbra Streisand album have been greeted with open arms by consumers.  Is Boyle overhyped? Yes, maybe a bit, but she does deliver on the pleasant 'I Dreamed A Dream', surprising skeptics, including myself.<br /><br />The album opens up with a pure, lovely cover of the Rolling Stone's \\"Wild Horses\\", which suits Boyle's voice perfectly.  It is as touching as any performance one saw while she was Britain's Got Talent, which is surprising (in a good way).  She follows up \\"Wild Horses\\" with her signature \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", which is just as satisfactory as \\"Wild Horses\\".  The cover of \\"Cry Me A River\\" is solid, if predictable, considering 'everybody and his brother' has cover the jazz standard (including Michael Bubl&eacute; on his latest album [[ASIN:B002KDUDG6 Crazy Love]]).  With that said, Boyle does the standard more than justice. \\"How Great Thou Art\\", one of several hymns covered by Boyle oddly skips the verse in favor of several iterations of the refrain.  While one verse would've been a treat,  \\"How Great Thou Art\\" is as lovely as all else from I Dreamed A Dream, particularly when the choir comes in harmonies behind Boyle's lovely, sincere vocals.<br /><br />\\"You'll See\\", a Madonna song, is very convincing as well.  Boyle's tender, revealing vocals lay well here.  \\"Daydream Believer\\" doesn't disappoint either, showing the vulnerability of Mrs. Boyle that helped to craft her 'celebrity.' Better yet is \\"Up To The Mountain\\", which finds Boyle singing accompanied by a choir and gospel-blues infused piano.  \\"Amazing Grace\\" is solid, though it follows the same uncompromising format of hymns \\"How Great Though Art\\" and \\"Up To The Mountain\\", making it slightly more typical.  The remainder of the album showcases a similar song and sound: \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" showcases a woman aspiring for something greater within life, convincingly.  \\"Proud\\", similarly features themes of 'empowerment' and 'dreams', a central theme of the album.  \\"The End of the World\\" finds Boyle accompanied by acoustic guitar while the album closes with \\"Silent Night\\".<br /><br />Essentially, there is nothing revolutionary about this album, much like Alan Jackson's [[ASIN:1423417615 Precious Memories]]; a simple, yet touching album.  What is great, though, is Susan Boyle's fantastic voice and her convincing performances throughout this album.  Sure, the end of the album is the slightest bit draggy in comparison to the beginning, but overall, it is an enjoyable, pure listen.  3.5 stars.ns of the refrain.  While one verse would've been a treat,  \\"How Great Thou Art\\" is as lovely as all else from I Dreamed A Dream, particularly when the choir comes in harmonies behind Boyle's lovely, sincere vocals.    \\"You'll See\\", a Madonna song, is very convincing as well.  Boyle's tender, revealing vocals lay well here.  \\"Daydream Believer\\" doesn't disappoint either, showing the vulnerability of Mrs. Boyle that helped to craft her 'celebrity.' Better yet is \\"Up To The Mountain\\", which finds Boyle singing accompanied by a choir and gospel-blues infused piano.  \\"Amazing Grace\\" is solid, though it follows the same uncompromising format of hymns \\"How Great Though Art\\" and \\"Up To The Mountain\\", making it slightly more typical.  The remainder of the album showcases a similar song and sound: \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" showcases a woman aspiring for something greater within life, convincingly.  \\"Proud\\", similarly features themes of 'empowerment' and 'dreams', a central theme of the album.  \\"The End of the World\\" finds Boyle accompanied by acoustic guitar while the album closes with \\"Silent Night\\".      Essentially, there is nothing revolutionary about this album, much like Alan Jackson's [[ASIN:1423417615 Precious Memories]]; a simple, yet touching album.  What is great, though, is Susan Boyle's fantastic voice and her convincing performances throughout this album.  Sure, the end of the album is the slightest bit draggy in comparison to the beginning, but overall, it is an enjoyable, pure listen.  3.5 stars.
B0026P3G12|3.0|Like many others, I was captivated by Susan Boyle's performance on 'Britain's Got Talent' and eagerly awaited the release of her first cd.  For me, this cd disappointed.  Her strong voice is still there, somewhere, but it doesn't come out in the recorded songs.  The passion is gone.  She is technically pure.  Hits the high, where the high should be hit, hits the low, where the low should be hit but it almost sounds like someone taking a singing lesson in that every technical aspect is executed but no passion, no musicality.  Her rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' which made the rounds on YouTube became an anthem, I believe, for many women.  The interpretation of the same song on this cd is vanilla.  Same goes for all the other songs recorded, they are slow and one just waits for her to be finished.  This cd will be a good cd to aid me in falling asleep, I certainly won't listen to it for enjoyment.  Ah Susan, Susan, what did they do to you?
1926606264|5.0|How many times can Scrooge fail at just being human? He seems talented at it. Ah, but there is hope. He is visited by four spirits, all compelled to motivate change.<br /><br />The specter of his business partner, Jacob Marley, presents himself as the transforming face on Scrooge's doorknocker. Scrooge dismisses the image. Marley appears again, this time he is dragging a heavy chain: \\"The specter raised a cry and shook its chains and wrung its shadowy hands. I wear the chain I forged in life...I made it link by link, and yard by yard.\\"<br /><br />Scrooge is not convinced. No problem. The night is young, and the haunting is just beginning.<br /><br />Who has not failed at something and yearned for another opportunity? Who has not made a fool of oneself at least once and longed to erase it? Who has not hurt someone, somehow, and not yearned to be forgiven? Scrooge represents fallen humanity in desperate need of a savior and salvation.<br /><br />At the age of 12, some sources say 10, Charles Dickens labored for 12 hours a day, six days a week in a boot factory finishing the bottles of boot polish. On the seventh day he visited his family at the Marshalsea debtors' prison. This lasted for two grueling years--a traumatic expanse of time for the young Dickens. He never forgot it, yet, he used his pain to create memorable characters like Scrooge and Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit's crippled little boy.<br /><br />The 48 illustrations in this edition are a fabulous addition to this wonderful Christmas tale. They were drawn by various artists from the Victorian era, and bring Dickens' timeless characters to life.<br /><br />Looking for the paperback edition of this novel?<br />[[ASIN:0980921066 A Christmas Carol (AD Classic)]]
031606792X|1.0|She repeatedly says that she does not know why people likes her saga. I agree. I have nothing to add after the numerous 1 star reviews coming not only from people who have been critical of the first 3 books, but also from those who have been their fans too.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|In 1992, Madonna hit her controversial peak with the release of her book \\"Sex\\" and her album \\"Erotica\\". I happen to think that both of these projects were highly artistic and courageous. Madonna was trying to make a statement about sexuality that some people simply misunderstood. She has said time and time again that she aimed to make people be tolerant, open-minded, and be able to see women as strong, smart, and in charge of their sexuality and not just as sexual playthings. However, contrary to popular belief, not all the songs talk about sex, and even the ones that do are written in a clever, subtle way. While I enjoy \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\", I believe this album is her best work. She has never been more experimental and provocative. Her cutting edge use of spoken word, neo-soul, and house beats was way ahead of its time. Many of the songs have a seductive, alluring quality to them, like \\"Words\\", \\"Waiting\\", and the title track. Madonna's power as a performer hasn't really been because of her vocal range, but because of the emotion in her vocal delivery and in this album, it feels as if she's seducing you, making you come back for more. \\"Erotica\\" is a rather daring concept album, honestly and frankly dealing with love, heartbreak, and sensuality. She discusses domination (the title track \\"Erotica\\"), home-wreckers (\\"Thief of Hearts\\"), oral sex (\\"Where Life Begins\\"), break-ups (\\"Bye Bye Baby\\"), and yearning for a child (\\"Secret Garden\\").  There are bass-pumping dance tracks like \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" and heart-wrenching ballads like \\"Rain\\". It's an incredible record from start to finish and it still hasn't gotten the recognition that it deserves, probably because of conservatives who were (and still are) uncomfortable about the subject of sex.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|It reminds me a lot of The Princess Bride, not fitting perfectly into any one genre, but a lot of fun nonetheless.    I am fortunate to have it on HD-DVD and fail to understand why it isn't on Blu Ray already.

B002MTTZ5I|5.0|this album and band are truly spectacular. i just listened to this cd for the first time on the bands myspace page and was laughing my a** off!! this is one of the most original music acts i've seen in a long time. and i listen to A LOT of metal. but this takes the cake.  it's PERFECT 80'S METAL with completely raunchy and funny lyrics. and by raunchy i don't mean the 'suggestive' type of lyrics laid down by 80's metal stalwarts like whitesnake, warrant and poison. these are some of the most explicit lyrics i've ever heard on one cd. (the only other cd that was worse than this was BODY COUNT's self titled album)  it's really hard to pick highlights from this album because every song is a highlight. but i'd say that DEATH TO ALL BUT METAL is my favorite of the bunch, with it's lyrics that tear down popular music acts of today and push for the death of them and their music.  so the bottom line is this: if you like the 80's metal style of music and aren't afraid of explicit lyrics about sex, then this is DEFINITELY the album for you!     get this album!!! you'll be rocking out hard and laughing your a** off at the same time.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|This DVD was so awesome I bought extra copies for friends.  The word \\"entertanment\\" doesn't do it justice.

B000065VB0|5.0|By 1980, Peter Gabriel had released two studio albums as a solo artist. Both were called 'Peter Gabriel.' The first one (or as many fans of his call it, 'Car'), was released in 1977 and was his debut album. That album contained 'Solsbury Hill,' one of his biggest hits, and 'Here Comes the Flood,' another minor hit. The second one (called by many fans as 'Scratch') was released on June 3, 1978. That album, while very well received by critics, was not a commercial success. That album contained 'Exposure' (one of my all-time favorite PG songs) and 'D.I.Y.,' which was a minor hit in the UK.     To start the eighth decade of the 20th century, Gabriel once again entitled his album 'Peter Gabriel.' This album, or as many fans call it, 'Melt,' was probably the best album of 1980. Gabriel was totally recreating himself and his style of music. He left Atlantic/Charisma Records (which had been his home since his days of Genesis, the label they signed to in 1971) in late 1979 and signed with Mercury Records. And with that label change came a MAJOR stylistic change. While his first two albums were straight-ahead progressive rock, Gabriel was experimenting with World Beat and other styles here.    From the moment one hears the drum beat intro to 'Intruder,' the opening track on 'Melt,' it's obvious that this album is a special one. Here was a man, 30 years of age, trying a completely different style of music.     There are many other classics here. 'Family Snapshot' is probably one of Gabriel's best songs of the 1980s, and I personally feel it never gets the attention it deserves. The rather bizarre 'Games Without Frontiers' remains one of Gabriel's more popular tunes (strangely, considering it's about as non-commercial as a track can get), but perhaps rightfully so. It's slightly humorous, but it's certainly classic.     'I Don't Remember' could have easily appeared on 'Scratch' and would have sounded right at home. 'I Don't Remember' is a prog-rock classic; Gabriel's yowl at the beginning is simply incredible. It's amazing how powerful PG's voice is.     But perhaps the most classic moment on this album is the closing track. 'Biko' was written for anti-Apartheid leader Steve Biko, who died prematurely in 1977 (police claim it was a hunger strike, although I have my doubts). This song is not only an anthem, it's a song that really makes you think. What a way to close a classic album like this one!    Overall, 'Melt' is, by a long shot, one of the best (if not, THE best) album(s) of 1980. Gabriel's emotion here and his writing here are at their peak. To me, it should be law that all CD/vinyl collections contain 'Melt' in them. Yes, it's that good of an album. It's a masterpiece.    Highly, highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended for anybody who enjoys Peter Gabriel even a little bit or likes music. A classic album from Peter Gabriel.    ENJOY!!!
B001U6YI92|3.0|For the past year I've been Netflixing and purchasing Blu-rays nonstop and I've seen atleast a hundred discs so far. Generally I've always been able to tell people that most Blu-rays look great, at the worst still better than the DVD release - that I've yet to see a truely bad release. This is all largely assisted by high bitrates. However, for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly the mastering studio really dropped the ball.    The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of the few releases (other than some asian Kung Fu releases I've seen) that I'd say the video quality is so bad that you may as well not waste the money upgrading your DVD.  They DNRed the film so much that it sort of looks like an oil painting.    It's a shame because the movie is so great, and definitely a classic. :/ So much detail lost.
0545123267|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The prose is so poetic and lyrical that it pulls you in and makes the atmosphere of the book just come alive as you read. It's flowery language without being overly so, and I should know since I absolutely abhor flowery language and unnecessary details. What Stiefvater does with her details, in my opinion, is necessary for the novel; I couldn't imagine this story being told without that attention to detail. It just would not work otherwise.    The romance between Sam and Grace is wonderful to read. With both of them being narrators (switching between chapters), you understand just how real their love for each other is. It's the perfect contrast to the cold, harsh winter setting of Mercy Falls, Minnesota, as reading about their devotion to each other just warms the heart.    All the characters are well-developed and I loved the banter between Sam and Grace peppered throughout the novel. But my favorite character probably has to be Isabel, Jack's sister, who mainly becomes more prominent toward the end of the novel, but her dialogue is just so hilarious; I loved it.     The book has some twists and turns to it and I really enjoyed the scientific approach to werewolves that Stiefvater took. It's very original (though I haven't read many werewolf novels, so...) and was really interesting to read about. The ending was done really well and was very understated, but it left me wanting more. I can't wait for the sequel, Linger.
045122499X|5.0|I read this book over a year ago and still find myself daydreaming about it! The length of the book may be intimidating to some, but the book flies by. I fell in love with all of the story lines and felt sad when the book was over.  My only advice is to try and pay attention early on to all the character's names because it gets a little confusing because the book is written over many years with many different characters!  Awesome read for men and women alike!
0812550706|5.0|I'm not generally a sci-fiction fan, but this book is a very compelling read about children learning war games to fight an alien menace.  I liked the book so much that I read another in the series, \\"Ender's Shadow\\".      Ender is the main character of this novel about child warriors.  At age 6, he is taken to Battle School to learn to fight the Buggers.  There he meets others who have also left family and friends behind.  Manipulated by adults, Ender is thrust into the role of leader of these other children all the while thinking he is just playing video games.  As any teen knows, it is easy to reset the game...but check this book out to find out Ender's reality.
B001TOD92C|5.0|\\"The Wrestler\\"is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei are exceptional.The movies filmed like a reality show,with the camera following the actors.

B002JIOQCO|4.0|What a great band Wolfmother is! Not only do they shamelessly rip off 1970s hard rock bands, they do so with gusto and even add a dose of creativity and quality songwriting. It's the last two details, and the fact that Wolfmother embraces classic metal, that really differentiates the band from the similarly unoriginal Killers. If you're a fan of retro rock, but require the band to add something to the music, this is a good album to take a listen to.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely adore Jillian Michaels.  I find her solo DVD's are FAR superior to the Biggest Loser workouts.  There's just no comparison in my opinion - she is so much better on her own.    I consider myself an intermediate on the workout scale, however, Jillian kicks.my.butt!  She is a no nonsense trainer and I love that about her!  She is not for the weak and not for the casual exerciser/dieter.  Don't bother with any of her DVDs unless you are truly serious about getting in shape and getting toned.  For beginners - take it slow and try to modify the workouts as best you can.  Unfortunately, many of her moves don't have a modification to them, but on some where I was having trouble, I just went a little slower than they did or found a way to replace it with a similar move that was a little easier.  I did this until I my stamina and strength increased.    Her instruction is a little lacking compared to many DVD instructors, but I don't mind that as much.  Just watch through it once and you'll figure it out.  It's not hard to follow along.
031606792X|5.0|No, Stephenie Meyer is not the most accomplished or eloquent writer. I'd even venture to say that her writing is below average. But she has something far more powerful than writing talent: she has a story that encompasses age, race, class and gender. She has managed to add a supernatural spin to the age-old Cinderella story, and do one better by making \\"Cinderella\\"  a plain Jane to everyone but this incredibly handsome, intelligent and awe-inspiring creature. Stir in a little angst by way of sexual tension, the hero's sheer willpower in trying not to kill his lady love, and a little thrill by creating characters who want nothing more but to kill said lady love and I'd say you've got yourself a yummy, hearty soup of a series. That's all I have to say, really. I won't go into the plot synopsis since you can clearly read that here or ANYWHERE else until you're sick of it, lol. It's the fourth installment of four books in the series. Get it, read it. The end.
B002SJIO4A|2.0|Warning! When movie critics review a movie, they should include a warning about the unfortunate trend that directors seem to be over-indulging in -- hand-held cameras.  The premise of this movie intrigued me immensely.  Right off, I wanted to stick around and watch how it developed.  I'm guessing the director thought the hand-held camera work would convey a more documentary-like feeling of verite and a sense of urgency. However, after about 15 minutes of watching jittery hand-held, fast-panned, jumpy  movements on the screen, the only sense of urgency I had was to leave the theatre, right away.  I had to settle for a retelling of the movie's plot and conclusion from my husband.  Perhaps it will not be as nausea-inducing on the small screen as it was on the big one.  If not, take your dramamine before viewing and then, enjoy.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I am happy with the purchase though I wasn't aware it was mono (i.e. would only record to one track).  Easily fixed by duplicating it in the other track but wish it recorded to both.  Also discovered a nasty buzz when microphone is attached to my HG21 Canon and the Canon is plugged in.  Took some trial and error to discover what the issue was.  Have to use battery power to the HG21 to eliminate it which required buying a larger battery (which I intended to do anyway).  Pleased with the purchase even with these issues.
0061537969|4.0|Not really. It's a man's life, told from the perspective of his dog. We read this book recently for my book club and it engendered a lot of discussion. I was surprised.  There was a lot of \\"my dogs are nothing like that...\\" and, \\"c'mon, the dog understood all that?\\"       All I can people, is, \\"Suspension of disbelief!\\"  Everyone reads vampire books and the discussion is never, \\"but, really, there's no such thing as vampires.\\" Why should a sentient dog be so unbelievable? I swear, I had a dog once, a wonderful Irish Setter, who understood everything that was going on and who even used humor to get his way. I swear!    So, open this book with the mind set that our dogs are smarter than we dare believe, and enjoy this fast read from the dog's POV. It is a charming, warm book, and I hope you'll love it as much as I did.    I'm sending my copy to my aunt...I know she'll enjoy it and pass it on too.    PS - I liked all the racing stuff too, for reasons way too complicated to explain here.
B002OEBMN4|1.0|I remember back in high school when the cool 'metal-heads' would play annoying stuff like \\"Reign in Blood\\" and \\"Show No Mercy\\"...and I'd laugh and tell them \\"That's not real Slayer! Why not play good stuff like \\"Gate Hates us all\\" or the song they did with Sum 41!  Well fast forward to 2009...Slayer has been popping out masterpieces left and right. Tom's Vocals are top notch and the solos are very original now!!    World Painted Blood demonstrates how far Slayer has come in its almost 30 year history.  The 80s Slayer was boring and generic...early 90's Slayer had potential but still sucked...it wasn't until Divine Intervention that things started picking up for this band.  If you thought Christ Illusion was great...check this out one folks!!    And remember...avoid stupid albums like Reign in Blood, Show No Mercy, and South of Heaven!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|i personally have to say that Mariah is the best singer song-writer and has the most uniqueness of them all i know all the words to this entire album. joy ride is genius and you would have a great time listening to it beginning to end because its so catchy. I also love so lonely part 2 which takes over one and only its sexy and firing u can relate to. the last i will comment on because i love all of them is Fly like a bird. i not a huge fan of gospel music but as Mariah continues to perform it i would love me Mariah is my Messiah. this song shows off her voice and she lets you know she still has it she great and (i wish her well only true mariah fans would know where i got that from) lol she's my best and i will never give her up she impresses me everyday
B000002J1U|5.0|Bought the album the week it was released.  At the time I was really into LZII and after hearing the first cut (\\"Immigrant Song\\")the rest of LZIII was a bit of a \\"shock\\".<br /><br />However, after a few close listenings you really appreciate their musicianship and versatility.  The Moog intro into \\"Celebration Day\\" is very cool, and the subtle guitar work on \\"That's the Way\\" and \\"Tangerine\\" is awesome.  \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is a great and powerful blues number. And the much underrated Jonesy does some great bass lines on bass pedals, in addition to playing Hammond Organ<br /><br />My original vinyl LP with the spinning wheel is but a memory, but the remaster CD sounds excellent and belongs in every Zepp fan's collection.
B00008RH1H|5.0|I'm not the biggest fan of Asian cinema.  I find it overly chaotic and confusing and at times very, very unrealistically cheesy.  It can be so over the top that I just sit back and laugh before rolling my eyes and walking away; FAR AWAY.  This problem is more prevalent in older Asian films, from the 50's and 60's.  Modern Asian cinema (especially the 90's Gong Li driven miracles) are much more grounded in realism and much more breathtakingly phenomenal.<br /><br />That said, when one really hits me, it hits me hard, and that is just what happened when I sat down to watch `Kumonosu-Jou'.  I admit, the first few minutes had me wondering if I was going to get tired of it and turn it off, but my worries were soon subsided as the film took me deeper and deeper into the world of Akira Kurosawa.<br /><br />It felt like home.<br /><br />My friends (at least the cinemaphiles) all tell me that Kurosawa will help me appreciate Asian cinema, and to be honest one of my `other' favorite Asian films is his (`Tengoku to Jigoku') but I haven't really had the chance to see the one I really want to (`Ikiru'), I don't have much interest in `Ran', although they all tell me it is AMAZING, and I had `Kagemusha' on my DVR forever before I opted to delete it (it was LONG) to free up space for some films that peeked my interest a little more.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I find `Rashomon' to be one of the most overrated messes I've ever seen.<br /><br />I'm really fickle sometimes.<br /><br />That said, I really should give him more of my time because `Kumonosu-Jou' is actually one of my favorite films, period.  I've seen it a handful of times over the past year and every time I see it my adoration grows.  I love how you can take something as universally loved and as universally recognized as `Macbeth' and create something so unique and separate yet completely faithful and respectful of the source material.  The initial concept is familiar, but the way that Kurosawa weaves this masterpiece is outstanding.<br /><br />I don't want to really get into the film's plot too much, because really, the fun is watching it all unravel, but I will say that it revolves around two friends who find themselves adversaries when certain predictions of their future start to come true.<br /><br />For me, the acting was truly outstanding, especially from Toshiro Mifune.  His command of his character's struggle for power and consumption with greed is just magnificent to witness.  I am one who found Isuzu Yamada brilliant as well.  Sure some fault her, but I found her perfectly consumed by her character's evil obsessions.<br /><br />And yet still, this film is all about Kurosawa.  The way he dissects each scene, adding layers of gorgeous scenery to embellish the films central emotional core is just flawless, and that final scene (those arrows) is just beautifully composed despite the savage way it is rendered.  He perfectly balances the ugly with the beautiful to create something that flourishes before our eyes.<br /><br />So, in the end I have to say that this is beautiful.  I really need to expound on my own intake of Asian art.  It is all a matter of taste, and I know that my preference when it comes to foreign cinema lies in the European side of things (the jovial French and Italian or the gritty rawness of German and Swedish) but despite my afflictions with Asian `chaos' I have found delight in films I at first rendered a waste of time.<br /><br />An open mind is wonderful thing.he film's plot too much, because really, the fun is watching it all unravel, but I will say that it revolves around two friends who find themselves adversaries when certain predictions of their future start to come true.

0061767581|4.0|If you like the hills you will probably like this book.(NO MENTION OF HEIDI OR SPENCER!!!  :) :))  Its the hills but its not.  I did however find myself wondering which character from the book was which character in the hills and often found myself forgetting the book plot because i would assume what i was reading about was a lunch date between lauren and brody and not the book characters.  The stories are very similar.  Its interesting to think how much from the book actually happened to Lauren.  I would like to read that book! True hills confessions..though i'm sure her contracts prevent that.
B00003CXC6|3.0|I know this is far from a popular opinion, but I find this lauded classic to be quite sloppy.  It's a messy, redundant film that has a deep message yet fails to really capitalize on its promise.  I really expected (especially with all the heaps of praise) for this film to blow my mind, and sadly it did, just not in a good way.<br /><br />Can you say `over the top'?<br /><br />Better yet, can you say `unnecessary'?<br /><br />Telling the tragic tale of a rape and murder through the eyes of fur separate people who were either party to or witness to the crime, `Rashomon' feels desperate in its attempt to alienate our emotions and cast aside all logic.  It is a film that begs you to get confused, because that is the point.  The film basically tells you up front that truth is nothing more than a belief subject to our own interpretation.  None of the stories told are wrong because they are `as they see it' and so we are not supposed to piece together this chaotic puzzle, we are just supposed to take in the `deeper meaning' Kurosawa presents to us.<br /><br />I would have loved to have done that, but I just couldn't.<br /><br />The film for me suffers in a few major areas.  The pacing is an issue for me.  Telling the same story four times becomes rather tedious and redundant.  There could have been a better way to have constructed this film.  While it is true that the four stories differ drastically, the inclusion of the same setting, scenery, characters and actions tends to grow tiresome.  There isn't enough variety to completely reign in my attention.  Another issue is the spastic acting.  I have mentioned this issue before in previous reviews, but my opinion of Asian cinema is not as high as others.  I find the unrealistically theatrical way they act these films to be rather off putting.  It is chaotic to the enth degree.  In some films it works, but in a film as deeply entrenched (or so it would like to be) in the raw emotional realism of `truth' I found the acting here to be distracting and out of place.<br /><br />What strikes me as even more `hurtful' to the films message is the fact that, when all is said and done, it fails to convey the message thoroughly enough to really make a valid impact.

0061864153|5.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan since the 1980's.  This album reminds me why I continue to be their fan each year!  I love track 2 - When We Were Beautiful.  Even non-bon jovi fans love them as hearing them live.  You've got to check out this album!!!!<br /><br />A Long Time Fan.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|When I heard `Bulletproof' I was in love, instantly.  It was fun, fresh, funky and totally what I needed to break through the monotony that can become modern top 40 music.  Someone was finally doing something different, making the 80's synth heavy pop music cool again and I, for one, was ready to take a big ol' bite out of La Roux.<br /><br />So I did.<br /><br />While this album is definitely a breath of fresh air when you consider the Miley Cyrus / Britney Spears / Black Eyed Peas mediocrity that fills the airwaves (I like `Party in the U.S.A.' but, I mean, how much of it can you take at one time) I have to say that I was letdown a tad when listening to the album as a whole.  I found that the songs began to run into one another, with no real distinction and no real diversity.  There are a handful of spectacular tracks and then a slew of what appears to be `filler'.<br /><br />I hate filler.<br /><br />There are only two songs that I don't like; `Cover my Eyes' and `Reflections are Protection'.  For me they are boring.  `Cover my Eyes' isn't `bad', but it just isn't anything I want to listen to again.  `Reflections are Protection' is just plain horrible.<br /><br />Songs like `In For the Kill' have a lot going for them, but the lack of musical fluctuation leaves the track rather redundant feeling, which is sad in this case because the initial beat laydown is one of my favorite on the album, and with some color it could have been the album's biggest standout.  `Colourless Colour' is soft yet maybe too simple, and songs like `Growing Pains', `Armour Love' and `As if by Magic' sound great but also sound too much like other songs on the album.<br /><br />I know this sounds like a weird comparison, but you know how all of Godsmack's songs sound the same (regurgitated chord structure, repetitive lyrics)?  That is the feeling I got when listening to half of this album.<br /><br />I wanted more variety.<br /><br />When she hits it hard though, she hits it out of the park.  Homeruns on this album include the aforementioned `Bulletproof', `Quicksand' and the brilliant `Tigerlily'.  These three songs stand out as `best in show' and encompass all that I want La Roux to embrace on her sophomore attempt.  `Bulletproof' is just fun, spunky and hip.  `Quicksand' has a sensual vibe that reminds me of Prince in a way; that slinky R&B presence lacing every second.  My favorite track here is `Tigerlily', a song that personifies perfection for me.  It has a brashness about it that I adore.  La Roux almost sounds as if she is attacking every word, and that aggression is a welcome twist to her delicate softness.<br /><br />In the end I give the album a B-, but I see a potential to deliver A+ material in the very near future., `Quicksand' and the brilliant `Tigerlily'.

B001LPWGE6|5.0|It was so good, nice product, it came so soon. I love it. Thank you, amazon.
0307386171|2.0|This is just plain old boring.  I didn't even finish it.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 2 stars and not 1 is the fact that it is only 200 pages.<br /><br />Regardless, the fact that I wouldn't spend an extra hour or so to finish it should help to explain how I feel about the book.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|The main theme of this season is one of transition. We see Clark get closer to Lois, and move further from Lana. We see the appearance of new villains now that Lex Luthor is gone.     At the end of the day however, while it was a good season, they failed imo. This was Doomsday's season, and they had a great concept with Davis Bloome... and it could have been so much better. There was retconning, plot holes, and a nonclimatic final fight scene.
0786868724|5.0|This is an excellent read for a person of any religion or  non-believer. Mitch Albom's boyhood rabbi has asked him to write his eulogy. Mitch requested a chance to get to know his rabbi as a person so that he might be able to write a better eulogy. Many of the rabbi's beliefs and philosophies are related to the readers. At the same time the author becomes acquainted with a black minister in downtown Detroit. He finds that the two men from divergent backgrounds practice their faith in very similar ways.    Although a very short book, much about living one's everyday life is written in a very flowing and readable fashion. Mr Albom is an excellent writer!    I have bought two books for my two sons and their families.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone should see this film even if only to strengthen one's resolve to continue ignoriing the obvious. As a faithful vegeterian for over 15 years, I was always well aware of the cruel animal practices put in place in slaughterhouses and meat factories all over the US. However, what I didn't know, was the increasing take over by corporations of these facilities as well as the farms that grow soy, corn and other products these companies use to manufacture poisons and unhealthy feed for their animals and now for their humans.   PLEASE! I urge you let this film open your eyes to what is really going into your food - it is your right as a citizen of this country to have the information presented in this film. You can then do with that information what you will, but at least you will have it and maybe next time you reach for a dozen eggs you'll think that maybe the cage-free variety in the recyclable packaging is just the smarter choice. At least you will have thought about it.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|If you are into gaming this is the best headset on the market, I have compared prices and Amazon is the best price. I recommend to anyone, this would really make someones Christmas special!!!
B0021L8UPS|4.0|I had to sit through FIVE previews before I could watch this movie.<br />It's one thing that movie companies want to put ADS on our purchased movies.<br />But it's quite another to FORCE you to sit through FIVE of them!<br /><br />Someone should start a movement of boycotting the dvd companies that force us to sit through previews. They should be one of the MENU items, to CHOOSE to watch them or not. They should not come on immediately without choice and without the option to SKIP or go back to the menu.<br /><br />As to the movie, it's good. I don't usually enjoy the horror genre, but this was a good one.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I pre-ordered because I was SO impressed with Susan Boyle's performances on TV and I just couldn't wait to get this CD! It is absolutely marvelous!! It appeals to my more \\"grown-up\\" musical tastes, although my 21 and 17 year old children loved it as well! What a stellar voice! On a couple songs we were reminded of Barbara Streisand..and on another, Celine Dion. We could just imagine where Susan would be now had she had the opportunities those ladies did!! We can't wait for the next release!! ........a Christmas album would be great!! Our whole family loves Susan Boyle - and we are blown away, not only by her incredible voice, but also by her charm and character. WELL DONE, SUSAN!!
1401323820|3.0|First of all, I can't believe I even bought this book!  I love all the tie-ins on Twitter and Facebook for the show, so I bought the book.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the show, you'll probably like the book.  If you're not, it's okay.  It's not a great book, but it's not bad either.  It's a quick read, which is sometimes nice.  Like the show, it entertains, but it doesn't stick with you.  I love \\"Castle\\" but darned if I can't remember anything about the episodes a couple days after watching!  This book is like that.  I read it.  I can't remember much about it.  I remember enjoying it.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I was one of those taken by the charm and pluckiness of Susan Boyle when she appeared on \\"Britian's Got Talent.\\"  Her \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" debut performance hit You Tube like a tidal wave and I listened many times.  Now comes the album... I thought that it was a very \\"safe\\" entry into the entertainment world.  The vocal arrangements were sweet and predictable, nothing showcased Susan's potential range.  Too many songs were old.  I did love the one written especially for her.  Her new rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was decent workmanship but it didn't have the punch of her live performance.  The great hymn, \\"How Great Thou Art\\" received only a choral performance and that was too bad.  If only she had sung the entire song, or at least the first stanza, \\"O Lord, My God, when I in awesome wonder, consider all the worlds, thy hands have made...\\"  She did a fine job on \\"Amazing Grace\\" but that Christian song has been in many cases devolved into an anthem of sorts and doesn't have the same meaning it once had.      Contradicting myself, I would LOVE to hear her sing \\"Danny Boy\\" and the song recorded by Trio, \\"My Dear Companion.\\"  I hope Susan will stay away from standards and oldies in the future and go for original music and more obscure ballads like Trio recorded, mournful and soulful.  I think it will be important for Susan to find her own niche in the future and she does have a wonderful future ahead of her!      Finally, the more one listens to the album, the more it grows on you!  Susan looks stunning in all the photos.
076790592X|4.0|I really liked reading this book. Someone put in their review that is really makes you think. They hit the nail on the head. As I read through this book I really connected with the characters and liked the way the story was writted. It gave me a lot to think about.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Admittedly, I am an adult. And I love fun and Christmas like just about everyone...but one of my secret indulgences is watching this  adorable version of ' A Christmas Carol' every year! Just call me a BIG KID who won't GROW UP all you want. I just love this one! You can have your Alister Sims or George C. Scott classic versions. Give me this one any day.     It's too sweet and adorable.    What makes this so much fun is the sheer creativity of having Rizzo the Rat and his Muppet buddy, \\"Charles Dickens\\" MC-the movie.  Their skits and sidekicks are just hilarious. But also--Michael Caine couldn't have been a better pick as Scrooge. And playing that  realistic human character against my favorite Muppets is just a  perfect touch- blending a good story with delicious humor.    For the kid in everyone, I recommend this contemporary classic!
B002TVQ4GW|4.0|I'm not sure that Triangle amounts too much besides the fact that mellisa george seems to be stuck in a time paradox. but what stands is a frighteningly surrealistic homage to the shining but on a boat. With a strong lead performance from george who keeps you enthralled in the confusing but riveting story line.Had the film opted for a more definitive plain of thought I would have given it a near perfect rating.
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|I bought the single disc edition and it specifies CLEARLY on the back that it has French (which I prefer) and Spanish tracks and subtitles. INCORRECT! IT HAS NONE. How can I contact this company and request my money back???
4770030096|5.0|I bought this book as a coupling to the Romaji version I had for my course.  I initially bought to sharpen my Kana reading/writing ability. For a beginner like me, it is very useful and help me to achieve my goal in learning Japanese.<br /><br />I definitely will recommend this book for people who are working full time and have limited time to study, since it teaches Japanese bit by bit from the simplest possible basis.  However it might sound tedious for people who want to learn it quick.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is great stuff. Unusual, eccentric, very very silly, and quite brilliant. Loved every moment, and the extra bit where the cast sings about the show (where they'd usually be talking about it) is inspired.  The songs are rather catchy too, after the second viewing you'll find them sticking in your head.     I hear there's a sequel planned and will be lining up to get that.
031606792X|5.0|Good grief. If we didn't buy into Stephenie Meyer's vision, why did we waste our time? Edward and Bella are HER characters. She dreamed them into existence, and we all went along for the ride! It is up to HER what happens to them, because Edward and Bella are HER creations. They belong to HER~  Anyone who thought Stephenie would torture Edward and Bella, apart from the purpose of creating a happy ending, is truly clueless. She loves them! I love them too. I thought Breaking Dawn was awesomely consistent with Stephenie's viewpoint that Edward and Bella are a very special couple.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is such a great movie, I loved this movie since when I was a little kid, and I still love the movie Dumbo. This movie is about an elephant who learned to fly. Some folks say Dumbo is a sad movie because the other elephants were not nice to Dumbo. When his mother got seperated from the other animals in the circus, his only friend was Timothy Mouse.   I know that you folks say Dumbo is sad movie, but This movie is GREAT!!!  Only the part when the other elephants spread roomers about his ears, and his mother was seperated from the other circus animals. Don't forget there are some happy parts in this movie such as when Dumbo meets Timothy Mouse, the hilarious pink elephants singing \\"Pink Elephants On Parade\\", when the crows teach Dumbo to fly and they sand \\"When I See An Elephant Fly\\", and when the audience saw Dumbo fly in the circus.    Dumbo is a great movie!!!    Dumbo is Walt Disney's 4th Masterpiece
031606792X|4.0|Although not my favorite book in the saga, Breaking Dawn was definitely not a lousy book as many other reviewers have said. Most reviewers complain that the writing is bad. I wonder why anyone would read the Twilight books thinking they would find good writing! I don't find Meyer to be a good writer in any of the four books, but I wasn't expecting it. This is an author who had never written anything, not even a short story, before writing Twilight. Her descriptions are lame, her characters are way too perfect and she repeats herself over and over again. Who cares? I read the Twilight books to read a good, easy and happy story. If I want something profound and with spotless prose I look for something else. Twilight is a guilty pleasure people, don't try to make it something it's not.  Some reviews say that some events in the last book were not \\"believable\\", like the fact that Bella's father didn't complain about her getting married at 18 or the fact that she gets pregnant and instantly forms a bond with the \\"little nudger\\". I ask, this is a book about vampires and werewolves and people are saying events in the story are not believable? That's like when people go to see James Bond movies and complain because they find it impossible to believe he could fight crime and never wrinkle his suit. That's the point people! It's fantasy, it's supposed to be unbelievable! If you want believable events, watch the news or read nonfiction. Nothing in this book seemed too far fetched for me, considering the girl falls in love with a 109-year-old vampire who doesn't drink human blood. After that, anything can happen.  People also complain becuase everything works out perfectly in the end. I understand people like things to be a little more complicated and that not all the good guys survive (think Dumbledore's death in Harry Potter). Call me shallow, but I actually liked the fact that everything ends perfectly; not one single vampire or werewolf is harmed, Jacob gets to be happy, andnobody's feelings are hurt. In a world full of complications, it's nice to be able to step into a fantasy where the good guys (if you can call vampires good guys!) win, the girl gets what she wants (including a super sized closet full of designer clothes) and there's happily ever after. That was exactly the way I wanted this story to end. I wanted Bella to marry Edward. I wanted Bella to be a vampire and I wanted her to be a good one, not some crazy newborn. I personally don't like Jacob at all, but I was glad he got his object of imprinting. And I'm glad the Volturi came and went without a fight. To me, the ending was a good fit to the rest of the story.  I read Breaking Dawn in two days. I could not put it down, just the same as I could not put down the other three books. While it lacks the action and suspense of the first three books, it is still a good fit for the saga. I wasn't expecting any great writing, I wasn't expecting amazing character development. I expected a happy ending to a simple but grasping story and I got that. Know what your buying people, don't kid yourselves (and remember, this was supposed to be a book for teenagers...) And anyway, if you read the first three books how can you bear not to read the fourth one?
B001AN26VM|5.0|This DVD is entertainment, old school style. Got this for a friend as a gift last Christmas - we had so much fun watching it. Of course it took two or three days to view it, but it was a great time!
0783225849|5.0|I recieved this product very quickly and in perfect condition.  It was a great experience with not problems what so ever.  Questions about the product were also promptly answered.
B001N26GFC|5.0|A superb film.  Acting, editing and even the music was delightful.  One of the best comedy's yet!  A feel good story. Sally Hawkins a real commelion actress, praise like this doesn't come much higher and of course the rest of the cast are superb as well.  Looking forward to his next film.  Mr. Leigh's one of the UK's treasures!
0385504225|2.0|\\"Formulaic\\" is pretty much it in a nutshell. Brown has a profitable formula going for himself, but that's about all. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" really grabbed the public, but it was the second book about Robert Langdon's adventures. The first one, \\"Angels and Demons\\" rode on the coat-tails of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" success and \\"The Lost Symbol\\" wouldn't be able to stand on its own either without Brown's homerun w/ \\"Code.\\" No, Brown is not a particularly good writer, but he knows how to crank out best-sellers based on what's already been successful and he has terrific people doing the marketing. In terms of \\"awesome,\\" \\"unpredictable,\\" and \\"edge of your seat,\\" been there, done that with \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" Now, I'm just yawning . . .
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Good price and service.  Bought for the grand kids, they loved it, I'm sure we'll be watching it alot.
B0001L3LUE|3.0|I definitely agree with most of what was said in this film, and that it is important for the citizenry to be informed on what the government does in respect to war. Yet this is honestly not an incredibly engaging film, and there are better sources out there on the same topic.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Good price and service.  I bought this DVD to replace a VHS tape of Snow White, the upgrade DVD player and the new DVD make quite a difference from my old version and player.  The grand kids had never seen a tape.  The first time I played it it had to be rewound and my grand daughter said \\"Grandpa you don't have to rewind a DVD what's wrong with you?\\"
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Another great Michael Moore documentary (keep in mind, it is a documentary, so he of course uses some controversial techniques to get his point across). An important film to see in light of the current debates on healthcare reform.
B002PQ7JQK|1.0|At this price, this is a silly item. The price is almost 30% higher than buying all three years individually.  Yet, it has no information to indicate this collection includes extra material to justify the premium. What a waste of time.
B001F6TXME|4.0|Great remote for Nikon D5000.  Better than the wireless version.<br />[[ASIN:B0027G1ZF4 Adorama Remote Release Cord for the Nikon D90/D5000 Digital SLR Cameras, 3 Feet Long (MC-DC2)]]
B002SR3T10|5.0|Should you pursue this for the second disc: \\"Jethro Tull Live/Christmas at St. Bride's 2008\\"? I must qualify my opinion: I collect both Jethro Tull and select Christmas recordings, so this issue should be a \\"can't miss\\" for me--and it is. The St. Bride's disc alternates between gorgeously rendered Tull offerings, tasteful St. Bride's choir pieces (four voices:quaint and charming), and select seasonal readings. Ian reads an excerpt from Walter Scott's \\"Marmion,\\" and his son-in-law (on the occasion of his wife's birthday) reads a piece called \\"Christmas.\\" \\"The Ballad of the Breadman,\\" though, is especially provocative. A surreal moment? How about when Tull plays \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman\\" for the offertory, and it's interrupted for a blessing?   The set is tastefully packaged. Gone are the lyrics from the original \\"Christmas Album,\\" but Ian and the reverend of St. Bride's contribute essays dated August 2009. This may be the only time the Tull lineup of Anderson, Barre, O'Hara, Goodier, and Duncan is recorded on a commercially available disc; if so, I would say it carries on a remarkable legacy most suitably. At the time of this posting, English \\"Marketplace\\" merchants are offering the collection for under twenty dollars, and mine arrived in seven days. Don't hesitate to buy it.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|Right now the Twilight books and movies are a major pop culture phenomena. However, this movie was the first to have sexy teen vampires; plus it has a way better story line. I highly recommend that all teeny-boppers out there watch this movie and then decide if Twilight is still their favorite.
067144901X|4.0|I wasn't too sure about this book, but the minute I started reading it to my boys, they were transfixed. My five year old has memorized it to read to my 19 month old. My 19 month old has most of it memorized himself! It's a quick, fun read with cute illustrations and I would recommend it to anyone with small children. We have the small board book in the car and the large board book at home. The kids even act it out sometimes. It was a good choice and I'm glad I bought it.
1416583408|5.0|An excellent book.  I still can't put it down.  I've already recommended it to others.  It's throughly researched and she presents her findings logically.  I've been a dog owner for most of my life and I found myself saying, \\"Yes, she's right\\" or \\"I never thought of that!\\"  You end up observing your dog more closely after you've read this book.  This is a great book for anyone who's had or has a dog, or is considering a dog.  Great for the older reader.  It maybe too complex for young readers.
