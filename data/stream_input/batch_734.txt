B000XKZQ74|1.0|after reading the reviews on this movie, i was really looking forward to it. yes, i heard the first 90 minutes could be slow, but you had to stick with it, blah, blah. let me tell you, this movie was an absolute disappointment from start to finish. i almost turned it off, but stuck it out. i regret that i did.    sorry, but this movie was a bore, plain and simple. the only benefit i got from this movie was the fact it was in german, so i learned how to say 'bad movie' in another language....\\"Schlechten Film!\\" - ok, i got that from google translator, but you get my point.    don't say you haven't been warned! there's plenty more you can do with 2+ hrs of your life than sit through this snoozer while you check your watch (and pulse) every 10 minutes, hoping it will just plain end.    remember, 'shclechten film!'

She may not have a vocal range to cut glass, but she has guts to try something new, or in this case old.  She executes the \\"flapper\\" to 40's era great!!  I get why Vogue was incuded, but this is a great piece without the last two tracks.  Just listen to \\"He's a Man\\", \\"Back in Business\\" & \\"Something to Remember\\" and you will see why she has been around for 25 years.

B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I am very surprised how much I like this CD! My friend let me borrow her copy and I was expecting it to completely suck because let's face it- Britney hasn't had the best year. After her performance at the MTV Music Awards I thought \\"There's no way she's ready for a comeback and her new album will probably reflect that.\\" So I was pleasently surprised with what she came up with. No not every song on the album is fantastic but I like the majority of them.    Gimme more: When I first heard it, I didn't like it much. Its defintely grown on me though.   Piece of me: Its an ok song. I think it was more about her speaking her mind than it being dance track.     Radar: Really good. Very catchy!   Break the Ice: Probably one of my favorite songs on the album! Starts off kind of weird but it's awesome!  Heaven on Earth: Reminds me of Kylie Minogue. But again, its a catchy song.  Get Naked (I got a plan): Eh..Its ok. I HATE the slow-mo back up vocals in it though. If they had gotten rid of that, I probably would have liked it more.  Freakshow: Its ok. Not great though.  Toy Soldier: LOVE THIS SONG! I would definitely consider it for the next single.   Hot as Ice: This one is catchy but at the same time, I had to get used to some of all the synthesizers and weird backup vocals. But its good.  Ooh Ooh Baby: A great track! Love it!  Perfect Lover: Its alright.  Why Should I Be Sad: Very telling of her personal life thats for sure!    So yeah, I really liked this CD. Most of the tracks are great. It will defintely be a shock to those who thought she couldn't pull it off. I expect the sales of this album to rise after the next few singles are released (IF they choose the right ones). I might suggest any the following:   -Toy Soldier  -Ooh Ooh Baby  -Break the Ice  -Radar
B0001AP14E|3.0|And points are docked for trying to interfere with this Man's artistic expression. Clean CDs suck, bad.<br /><br />I hate them.<br /><br />But if that's all I can get at the time, I may just settle. Most likely I won't though.<br /><br />I like some of the skits but 4-5 is too much. Spaceship is an obvious highlight. It's about working at a dead end job not getting paid enough having big dreams and because of all of that walking the hell out of that mother____er!<br /><br />I like His style in that song. And the production is super-solid. The singer actually singing is great too. 5.5/5 ' 11/10 His lyrics are OK in places, shine on 2-3 tracks and are really lacking on some such as The Workout Plan which isn't a bad song by any means. But to put it plain and nicely You will only like this if You like Your Hip-Hop funny and shallow. It's OK for what it is I suppose. 3.5/5 ' 7/10<br /><br />Next, is Jesus Walks. It's solid but nothing great. It's religiously-themed which is OK, I suppose. But I'm basically an Atheist, that Believes sometimes. Agnostic Anyone? 3.75/5 ' We Don't Care is pretty solid. It's a serious subject, made funny and many people would NOT appreciate what Kanye did here. I'm one of the thousands that don't give a flying s*** about Him rapping about Kids selling drugs (*LOL*). Nice lyrics, relate-able even if You don't sell. 4.25/5 ' 8.5/10<br /><br />All Falls Down is a ballad(?) and it's very great and even more recognizable. The video is crazy good and features the beautiful Stacy Dash. 4.5/5 ' 9/10 Slow Jams is as solid as the fore-mentioned track All Falls Down. It's a slowed-down-sexy-groove-alicious treat for R&B junkies. Features the smooth-vocaled crooner Jamie \\"nice behind in The Replacements\\" Foxx and Twista \\"the \\"fastest\\" rapper alive\\" (which I DON'T Believe for a second! He ain't THAT fast.). 4.5/5 ' 9/10<br /><br />Never Let Me Down is decent. It featured Common I Believe. I like the Guy at the end Who gives off a powerful speech. I enjoyed that the most. The rest was OK and slightly forgettable. 4.5/5 * 9/10 The New Workout Plan is like the original but so much \\"funnier\\". LOL sure! 3.25/5 ' 6.5/10 Get Em High is with Ludacris(?). It's OK and far from solid. 3.825/5 ' 6.5/10 Breathe In Breath Out is strictly about weed and maybe sex. I like the latter, could care so much less about the former. 3/5 ' 6/10<br /><br />Family Business Through The Wire and Last Words are in the top 6 best songs here. Family Business touches on a barbecue setting where Kanye's family get to show Their personalities when socializing eating and dancing. Sometimes His \\"Aunt Sheila and Aunt (?) get heated at every house warming...\\" 10/10. Through The Wire definitely has trouble keeping up with that track. It's very catchy, has a nice Chaka Khan \\"Through The Fire\\" sample and has decent lyrics. Kanye's trademark song. 9/10 Lastly, Last Words Features simple and quick-look-it's-JayZ-on-the-track-oh-no-Hes-leaving! vocals on it. It talks about Kanye's troubles before He became a well known Rappin'-Producer.<br /><br />==> Love his swagger, attitude, big ego sometimes, his decent vocals, decent but over-bloated lyrics and his sign; Gemini, Gemini (The Twins)<br />==> Love most of the samples, namely Spaceship and Through The Wire<br />==> The guest appearances were gold<br />==> In my top 10 favorite rappers<br />==> The cover rocks; a cute yet sad, lonely, and maybe distraught bear - I kinda felt that way in 2004.

B00005JO5L|3.0|I saw this movie in the theatres when it was released in 1980 and defended Mr. Friedkin's (\\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"Boys In The Band\\") right to make it when my friends protested its opening. I was curious to see what \\"Cruising\\" looks like over twenty-five years later. It does not wear well with time. Taken from a book by the same name, it's all about a homosexual serial killer who is making a bloody path through New York City's leather community. Al Pacino as Steven Burns of NYPD complete with a full set of leather goes undercover to catch the killer. The plot is still hard to follow and often doesn't make much sense; Pacino, who is such a fine actor, doesn't get his act together here, probably through no fault of his. (He allegedly said that this is the worst movie he ever made.) Much of the film is shot in a leather bar in New York City to give-- I supose-- realism to the story.<br /><br />The DVD contains a long and winding defense of this film by the director William Friedkin. He should have left well enough alone. He tries unsuccessfully to convince us that \\"Cruising\\" is in no way homophobic. If he is not attempting the sensational, then why does he use what he calls more edgy music than the music that was playing in the bars when he made this film since he only wants to give an accurate depiction of the gay leather community? Do members of that community have women's names and constantly refer to each other with feminine pronouns? Are we really to believe that a muscle-bound member of the NYPD force wearing only a cap, boots and a jock strap roughs up a suspect at the precinct station? Mr. Friedkin says a similar event actually occurred but offers no proof of that. The ending is laughable. All of Pacino's soulful staring into the mirror will not make a great, serious film out of a homophobic slasher. In addition to all the footage of Friedkin, the minor characters give interviews although we do not get one word from or glimpse of Mr. Pacino. Jerry Weintraub, the producer, says that the novel from which the film is made is an \\"important piece of literature.\\" I kid you not.<br /><br />If Mr. Friedkin had depicted the African America or Jewish community-- or any other minority for that matter-- in such a way, he would have been vilified to the heavens. While you certainly do not have to be homosexual to make a movie about gay people that portrays them as complex, flesh-and-blood individuals-- Mike Nichols, for example, does a wonderful job in \\"Birdcage\\" of making a funny but honest movie-- it would be interesting to see what a gay director would have done with this story. Probably nothing.<br /><br />I rant on. The good news is that I didn't pay a lot for the rental of the movie and that it will have the fate of most dull movies and become a bit of the history of gay cinema since it's not quite bad enough to make cult status, at least not for me.says that the novel from which the film is made is an \\"important piece of literature.\\" I kid you not.

0201626632|3.0|I think this book could be really helpful to first year Master or PhD students, especially those who want a career dedicated to research in academia or also a government lab.  I thought the subject matter was good and written in an interesting way, but my big problem was the lack of detail and excess of anecdotes.  Mostly, the chapters seem more like half-chapters; introductions to good ideas that aren't elaborated upon.  As someone who is at the end of a first post-doc looking for \\"what's next\\" outside of academia, there was not any revelatory information in this book - just good reminders on how to be savvy about your scientific career and make a good reputation for yourself.
B00005JPTI|2.0|Dont let the previews fool you, this movie is not about zombies. There are bits and pieces where they make an appearance but this movie is not about zombies. Its a Cast Away-inspired slow paced film about a man who has lost his mind due to the fact that he thinks all humanity is gone but him. The whole thing is his everyday life and how he survives. Its very serious and minimal action which I was really hoping for. So if your expecting Resident Evil type action dont waste ur ten bucks. But if ur down with the depressing lonely life of one man in new york then this is for you.
B000XYNFD2|5.0|finally purchased this much talked about time piece from invicta . almost bought this watch last year but went with the invicta 3076 scuba which is another famous sought after watch. well with that said i have no regrets with either purchase. this 9937 is probally the most reviewed talked about watch on the internet . now i see why ! i have personally been in high end jewerly and watch stores and have tried on the rolex submariners. that watch is probally my dream watch to own , but in all reality its just that a dream watch at least for now anyway. however i must say when i recieved my 9937 and looked at and held it in my hand i can say my dream watch in a way has become a reality . i have seen alot of watches and came across a few that matched the rolex submariner as far as watches that had the same look or style. but without a doubt this invicta 9937 is the closest thing i have ever seen to being in that level. this invicta 9937 watch without a doubt lives up to its reputation to being the next best thing to owning a rolex submariner. actually with the price i paid which was only 330.00 i actually think its a better watch than the rolex which retails for 4,500.00 to 5,000.00 dollars. i mean hey if u can afford that God bless ya , but if ur a little shy on the clams why bother when u can buy this much sought after almost as famous if not more famous time piece. i looked long and hard to find the 9937 with the coin edge bezel and finally found it and bought it . my only suggestion to anyone interested in getting the 9937 is to get the one with the coin edge bezel. i think it adds to the value of the watch since its so rare and hard to find. again another great purchase of one of the best diver watches made by invicta. i love it and it lives up to its name and reputation. if u can find this much talked about watch and can get it dont hesitate there are not many of them out there especially with the coin edge bezel. a must have in ur collection!!!!
1416911049|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down for the life of me.  This book is about a girl name Tally. She has been an ugly all her life but her 16 birthday is coming up. You see, at 16 uglies forgo a plastic surgery that makes them into pretties. But Tally decides she doesn't want to be pretty and runs away to The Smoke. Here she gets entangled in a conspiracy to keep people like Tally quiet about wrongs that are being committed.  All in all this is the greatest scifi book I've ever read.  If your a Lois Lowry fan, this book is for you.
B0000041Z3|5.0|People talk about \\"desert island\\" lists, but \\"lived with\\" lists impress me more. I've lived with the Maazel/VPO Sibelius set for decades, and I still listen to these recordings frequently. After hearing many other performances and interpretations of these symphonies, Maazel's interpretations not only hold up, but almost always exceed them for insight, energy and emotion. I have yet to hear better performances of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 7th symphonies; the 3rd and 6th are also very good. The sound is fine. At this price, there is no reason to hesitate -- you will enjoy these CDs for a long, long time.

B000Y44LBG|5.0|After Harlem druglord Bumpy Johnson is killed, his driver and bodyguard Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) decides to take over. But Frank has a plan to dramatically increase his share of business in the highly competitive New York City heroin trade. Frank goes directly to the source, the Golden Triangle region of Thailand, to buy massive amounts of pure heroin which he brings back to the U.S. on military aircraft. By  selling his higher quality \\"Blue Magic\\" heroin at a lower price, Frank undercuts the competition and becomes not only wealthy but the new \\"Robin Hood\\" of Harlem. Along the way he purchases a mansion for his mother, brings his relatives up to help run the business and marries Miss Puerto Rico.    In a parallel storyline, Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a honest cop in a police department full of corruption. When Richie gets the opportunity to head a federal drug investigation his group gets nowhere until they are finally able to recognize that Frank Lucas is the man running the show. But even after the law begins bearing down on him, Frank, fueled by pride and perhaps greed, refuses to \\"quit while he's ahead\\" and remains in the drug business. I won't spoil the ending. But it includes an interesting twist that maybe I should have seen coming but didn't.    It's true that this movie is a genre piece with some rather cliche angles - corrupt cops, a gangster with \\"a heart of gold\\" etc. And it is a bit overlong and could have used some additional editing. But still this movie features high quality film making that never left me bored. Washington and Crowe are both excellent actors and their characters are more compelling and multi-dimensional than in your typical Hollywood flick. The sounds and settings were also well done, impressively capturing NYC in the 70's with Nixon in office and the Vietnam War winding down. It remains to be seen whether this movie will have the staying power of classic gangster movies like \\"Scarface\\" and the \\"Godfather\\". But I foundit to be one of the better movies of 2007.
B000Q66PXE|2.0|The first 2 disks (not seasons) were interesting, but the characters blend into eachother...and even knowing quite a bit more about Roman history than the average joe...the mistakes were just awful. Modern habits, slang, and even 'too-perfect' costumes made me cringe at every scene.    All this aside, the storyline was VERY hard to follow. One episode isnt much different than the rest. One big drama episode with zero continuity. I had mistakenly watched all the episodes on disk 1, then started disk 3. I didnt really miss much when I went back for all of disk 2!    I was really looking forward to this series, but I just can't get into it any more. Its as inaccurate as the \\"1980's Cafe\\" in Back to the Future.

B000Q66PXE|5.0|Brilliant series that is hard to believe was made for TV, even if it is HBO. Top notch production featuring excellent writing, performances, cinematography, action etc. The gold box special at 60 bucks for both seasons 1 and 2, is a steal considering other sites are selling this set in excess of twice that. Lots of worthwhile extras. And to all those fans complaining about the initial high price.., Blame HBO for overpricing their stuff, not Amazon.com. Grab this set before the price goes back up.
B000UZNRS2|3.0|Baldacci brings his characters into a dangerous present spawned by decades old fears, failures and betrayel.       Unfortunately, the quality of the storytelling is not the top of this author's craft.  Angry, but not really engaging, the story builds toward a climax that seems thrown together as if Baldacci had just desided to move on as soon as possible.  I was reminded of the way Ludlam faltered into the same theme, sliding from the hights of thrilling heroism to the mud puddles of cynicism.  The message that &#34;National leaders are all evil&#34; is not really very entertaining to me personally, but it can certainly be penned with better wit and style.
B000YAF4OS|4.0|The idea of a mist full of monsters which traps a group of people inside of a small grocery store is a wonderful image of hyper-rational late capitalist society coming up against the world that it has excluded and repressed in order to be built up: the realm of gods, demons, devils and archaic matriarchies which demand human sacrifice. As Jane Ellen Harrison writes in her analysis of early Greek religion, the primary offerings that were made to the cthonic gods were not made in order to get the gods to come down and do their bidding, but rather to make them go away. THIS was the early idea of religiosity in pre-Homeric Greece, and it is also the idea suggested in this film by one of its lead characters, a wacky, female Christian fundamentalist who believes that the mist has been sent by God as a punishment for the sins of atheistic capitalists.<br /><br />Late capitalist society, with its desire to turn the entire globe into one gigantic shopping mall, in which shopping becomes the primary ritual which displaces all others, does so only at the cost of arousing the ire of societies which still retain the idea that piety and sacrifice (not necessarily human, of course, but the sacrifice of the ego) are the goals proper to the human spirit. The group trapped inside the grocery store is a wonderful metaphor for capitalism under siege by the Other: religiously motivated societies which revolve around death and not life.<br /><br />But then, of course, the store with its people inside can be looked at from a broader perspective as a microcosm of the breakdown of any civilization, period, as a sort of illustration of what happens to a civilization during a so-called \\"time of troubles\\" when leadership and a single ideology break down into diviseness and internal proletariats which attempt to sabotage leadership, while the external proletariat of the barbarians come crashing at the gates to deliver the deathblow to the weakened society. It is the same story whether we are talking about Mesopotamia, Egypt, Rome or our present day world which is under siege from \\"without\\" -- although, with globalization there is now only a within, so the adversary must metastasize and become cancerous in order to have any effect. All social classes are represented in the film: the military, religious fundamentalism, the proletariat, leadership, the worker, etc, and this is a clue to its function as an allegoriccal microcosm.<br /><br />There is a certain similarity to the premise of the recent Beowulf film, in which monsters must be fought and subdued if civilization is to be erected, although in the case of Beowulf the situation is reversed, since that story concerns what is necessary in order to begin civilization, while The Mist concerns itself with what happens at the end, when the strength and singlemindedness of leadership can no longer be summoned up to fight the monsters in order to keep the machine running, and so the machine breaks down as the monsters come pouring in across the border (in this case, the plate glass window of the storefront). In the original Beowulf, the monsters are killed and civilization is victorious: in Stephen King's original story, civilization lies in ruins and the monsters are victorious. Frank Darabont has changed King's ending, but the overall point of the story -- the breakdown of civilization, which is happening all around us at this very moment -- is still the same.<br /><br />This is, admittedly, a \\"highbrow\\" intellectual reading of the film and of King's narrative. Most people will insist that the film is, at bottom, just an entertaining popcorn movie that seeks to thrill us with its hi-tech images. But I am of the opinion that every narrative, no matter how innocuous, has a point to make whether we choose to draw it up out of the well of subliminality or not. And since the job of our poets and artists, whether they know it not, is precisely to become aware of the subliminal undercurrents that are going on in our society all the time, but which remain hidden to our conscious view, it stands to reason that their narratives are really attempts to communicate to the rest of us, using the picture language of mythology, what is happening to the environment in which we find ourselves situated.<br /><br />Frank Darabont has done a fine job here with his adaptation of King's very good novella, and it is hoped that he will continue to apply his intelligence and good taste toward the adaptation of more of King's stories and novels, for Darabont is a little more consciously aware than King is, that these stories are making a point beyond that of being just good entertainment for the masses.<br /><br />I look forward to the next one.<br /><br />--John David Ebert<br />author, [[ASIN:1877275743 Celluloid Heroes & Mechanical Dragons: Film as the Mythology of Electronic Society]]ch remain hidden to our conscious view, it stands to reason that their narratives are really attempts to communicate to the rest of us, using the picture language of mythology, what is happening to the environment in which we find ourselves situated.

I ordered this: I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Some of the cuts just sounded fine and the bonus material actually filled out the concert and I was back in '68 when TYA could make me proud that I had saved $4 to go out to hear the latest band that week.<br /><br />This holds up a lot better than the first lp does.  Sure Lee gets into that crazy stuff that sounds a lot like listening to a food processor, but by and large, the set sounds really good.

But the compilation cd is missing one song. The Ocean. Being a Zeppelin fan, I was astonished to see that the song was not on the album. Overall, I give this album a 4/5 stars, many great Zeppelin songs are on there, and it's a great listen, but the album seems like it's not complete without The Ocean there.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|We received this tape in '89 when we still lived in Holland, our oldest son seven, his little redhead brother four. They played it so often, it's a miracle that it still has not worn out. Now, in the year that both graduated from college, we think it's nice to give both the DVD of this timeless little story.<br />As parents we liked that it was such a 'fresh' story, not one of the traditional, somewhat worn-out, central-European or American fairytales. Actually we would have not minded if Santa had not been the center of the snowmen get-together. We definitely enjoyed the absence of tradional Christian themes or figures.<br />The character development is great. In 23 minutes getting a friend, share things out of one another's lifes, then having to live on after hardly a goodby.<br />Finally, it'll prove to be an historic piece, when the next generation children will ask their parents: \\"was there, back in those days, really that much ice and snow on the North Pole?\\"
0765318741|4.0|The title of my review says it all. Richard Matheson is obviously twisted, but the way he takes such horrifying things out of his imagination and puts them onto paper is rather amazing. I was expecting something entirely different from this book; for one thing I didn't know that it was a compilation of various stories. However, it held me entranced the entire time I read it, and I would definitely recommend that you check this book out if you want to read something VERY different.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|This is easily one of the best shows that has been on TV.  It's a dramatic, politico-intrigue thriller, and it's pretty accurate to the broader strokes of history (by TV/film period drama standards) -- perhaps though I don't expect the same level of exacting adherence to historical fact as the previous reviewer who complained that Cicero wasn't actually in Rome during an important vote.   The acting is superb and the cinematography lives up to the high standards set by other HBO shows.     All the reviewers who gave this box set a low rating for its price: you are not helpful -- The price fluctuates, but the product doesn't change.  I agree with what you are saying that it is stupid how these WERE priced more as a boxset than individually, but you should add your comment about the price to the end of your post as a footnote -- and you shouldn't incorporate it into your rating of the ROME series (maybe minus one star if you feel it's a huge ripoff, but make that clear).  Any semi-conscious consumer knows $180 is a rip-off, to say nothing of the fact that we all have different price points.  All of you are being so unhelpful while being self-righteous/whiny it is ridiculous.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|In this quirky and uplifting film, will ferrel plays harold crick, a socially awkward IRS auditor living a very lonely and confined life.  Besides work, harrold occupies his time by performing compulsive number related mental activities.  For example, in the morning he has to brush his teeth the by the exact number of strokes and he has to take percise number of steps while trying to catch the bus thereafter.  His routined life is quickly disrupted, however, when he began hearing the naration of his existance by a female english author.  At first he suspects that he might have lost it, but later comese to realize that he might be a character in this unknown author's(to him) latest work.  To further complicate things, he finds out that the author intends to kill him at the story ends.  This piece of knowledge led him to, in a way, break out of his shell and go after the things he had always wanted in life and make the most of what he has left.      I like the imaginative plot and subtle humor in this.  There are too many movies nowadays where the story seemed to have been done hundreds of times before and the only things things that change are the locations and stars.  This is a bit of a departure from hollywood normality and that is a good thing.  The acting is excellent, especially ferrel's performance.  I didn't know he was capable of turning out such subtle hilarity.
0140277447|5.0|Reading Iris Chang's \\"The Rape of Nanking\\", it staggers the mind to think that the brutality she describes is even imaginable.  Yet, as countless records and testimonies have shown, the cruelty of the Japanese forces in Nanking (Nanjing) was real and should not be overlooked or ignored by history.  By the end of the Japanese occupation, hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians were murdered in cold blood, many after being raped and tortured.  This book tells the harrowing story of those who died, those who did the killing, and those who bravely worked to save Nanjing and it's inhabitants from certain death.    This is not an easy book to read.  Iris Chang provides grisly details about the most inhuman acts of violence documented during the occupation.  The accounts she gives are both shocking and unforgetable - yet, that is the point.  We should understand just how evil human beings can become and strive for something better.    Of course, many will no doubt fault Iris Chang for her lack of objectivity (her family narrowly escaped the city before the Rape began).  But this is not meant to be a dispassionate analysis of military movements or statistics related to population decline.  Instead, this is a passionate work which is meant to call attention to one of the worse war-time atrocities in modern history.  Published almost 10 years ago, the author begins her work by saying that the Rape of Nanking is largely unknown outside of Asia.  Over the past decade however, I think this book has changed that, and has lead to an increased awareness of this tragedy in the West.  But, as world understanding of this event has grown, the Japanese government still insists on minimizing the true scope of the Rape.  It seems the only people who were influenced by the pro-Japanese propoganda which circulated in Asia during World War Two, were the Japanese themselves.        This is one of the most influential popular history books ever written.  It deserves to be read by everyone,especially in an age where the brutality of war is becoming more common and more destructive.
B00005JPTI|3.0|The plot was exciting, but the climax was actually the moment the hero stepped into the trap. From there on, it was all DOWNHILL. I've got enough of Doomish monsters already. By the way, was the trap his own or made by the monsters? If by the monsters, wouldn't they also be smart enough to get clothes to protect themselves from the sunlight?? The monsters can climb the outside wall of a building, but not a security wall at the mountain village?? Geez... Hollywood writers' logic?     I was expecting a survival story, a kind of Robinson Crusoe. I Am Legend had great potential for a great story, but for some reason, the writers decided to borrow quite a bit too much and innovate too little.     MESSAGE TO STRIKING HOLLYWOOD WRITERS: Get a new job. We need that.    (I went to see the movie during a visit in Taipei)
B000TLMWLK|5.0|Johnny Cash has always been a pert of my musical experience.  His wisdom in life and recognizing other talented people is what i admire the most out of him.  He has helped more musicians than anyone else during his time.  And those folks were fans and loved his craft before he discovered them only to continue to adore him and appreciate his humble gestures.  The one shining example is Trent Reznor from NIN.  When johnny covered the song hurt it accentuated the despair that the song has and it proved to be one of trent's most cherished moments to hear his version of hurt.    Well in this dvd shot in the late 70's Johnny is at it again.  the great moments of his tv show shot in the famed Ryman theater in Nashville at a time when the music and artist were not mainstream is pure genius.  There are some vintage performances on this dvd sure to attract fans of music be it country rock or blues it's all here.

B00005JPTI|2.0|You know when you start supporting the \\"zombie\\" or whatever instead of the protagonist , that the movie has just gone to s%%t.

1582701709|1.0|Are people really THIS gullible? I was very excited about reading this book, but I am sorry I wasted my time. I thought it would offer some valuable pointers on how to improve life at home, at work...etc. The ideas in this book teetered on the edge of insanity. Being an educated person, I'm actually embarrassed to even tell people that I read this book. Simply think about getting that parking spot right next to the shopping store and you'll get it???!! C'mon! Just for a hoot, I tried this method one night after learning that I needed hot dog rolls for my hot dogs (I didn't tell anyone this, of course)...LOL! The rolls never came---SURPRISE! This writing is ridiculous and I feel sorry for the senseless readers, who are now thinking they can get out of the poorhouse they are in by imagining the bills they are receiving in the mail are actually lottery tickets. Alas, I guess there can really never be a successful \\"sequel\\" to this book, because once people try the bogus methods and learn they don't work, they won't think about buying another one like it.
B000TGCR38|2.0|Director Paul Verhoeven may have \\"gone back to his roots\\" with this foreign language production about the Dutch resistance during WWII, but he took a lot of bad Hollywood habits with him.  Most egregious among them is the overly busy plot, rushing from incident to incident and thrill to thrill, full of coincidence and contrivance.  The film never seems to be willing to slow down enough for us to really spend some time with these characters to fully appreciate their dilemma; Verhoeven and his screenwriters seem too impatient to get to the next plot twist.  The cast is superb, but it is difficult to care very much about what happens to the people in this story.

B0013FBS20|5.0|There's lot of Bob Marley in this film. My favorite line was the Bob Marley quote about why he was going to perform TWO days after being shot in an assassination attempt: \\"The bad people in the world never take a rest, so neither can I.\\" Bob Marley believed that music and love could change and heal the world. He was a true visionary, and I'm so very glad his very important message has not been forgotten by Hollywood! Playing various tunes from his Legend album makes Bob Marley's dream for peace all that more poignant!<br /><br />I'm a fan of the original Omega Man film with Charleston Heston. Over the years I have watched it about a dozen times. I never tire of it! This remake pays homage to the original. But it's a very, very different interpretation. For example in the original film it was a biological warfare agent that got loose in the world. Now it's a genetically engineered virus to cure cancer that caused the destruction of the human race. In other words - biotechnology does us all in!<br /><br />\\"I Am Legend\\" also made me squirm because other than the occasional Bob Marley tune, so much of this film had zero music or sound effects. After a while you felt the Will Smith character's mind-boggling loneliness. This is first, and foremost, a psychological film. Even the movie theater audience barely made a sound! The filmmakers had tremendous courage not to dumb the story down to the level of adolescent boys. I have been begging Hollywood for years to make a Sci-Fi film suitable for the mature adult mind - so thank you! You've done it!<br /><br />My favorite scene was the very last one. It showed how civilization can survive in the future - by being self-sufficient. Keep an eye out for the ultra-modern windmills and solar panels. The scene only lasts a few seconds, but it speaks volumes!<br /><br />This film will be watched a 100 years from now! It's that good!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:1602399840 Mini Farming: Self-Sufficiency on 1/4 Acre]] and The Long]] and [[ASIN:6305870810 One Love - The Bob Marley All-Star Tribute]]N:6305870810 One Love - The Bob Marley All-Star Tribute]]
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|A fast paced zippy action film. The director shoots the movie like you are experiencing the events that Jason Bourne is experiencing. The whole movie has a real life edgy feel to it due to the fact that no steadycam was used so the camera keeps shaking and gives you this documentary real life feel to it. There are very few dolly shots in the movies, it all with handheld camera. The camera is placed in specific angles and hard to reach places like the inside of the car so that you feel a lot like being in Jason's seat. The extras feature have quite a bit on how they shot the chase scene, the fight moves and the special car rig that they built to get the shots. The car chase scene is one of the greatest chases captured on film. It's hard and fast and ends with full impact. The movie does not follow the book. Ludlum's novels Bourne - Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum document his life as he grows old in fact in Ultimatum if I am not mistaken he is a senior citizen with kids and grand kids. The movie version takes book 1 and expands on it and uses the Bourne franchise name. I have no problem with that. The books as it were would not have worked in the medium of film. Good action flick. Watch Bourne always outsmart the CIA. Watch Bourne Ultimatum whih is an episodic continuation and end to this successful series.    regards, Vikram
B000YKFJ66|2.0|guys will love the last half of the movie but the first 45 mins are made for the women.  I have to say i loved the last 30 or so mins but the movie as a whole was maybe worth a 2 1/2.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I found this movie to have the best and longest build up that I have ever seen on screen. PT anderson directs this movie as an epic and he paints this expansive story about a bunch of individuals with an operatic pallete. The soundtrack score is the most bold and audacious. There is a long sequence of shots which is accompanied by repeated staccato notes. The director and the composer are being bold here. Right from the prologue scene up until say 45 mins into the movie, PT anderson builds the scenario with the bold score and his balletic and long steady cam shots. The problem is that the the build up is so good that the movie is forever building up. The premise we are given is that these seemingly disconnected lives playing out in parallel are going to come together in some unexpected commonality or shall we say a kind of \\"got you\\" twist ending. But it isn't meant to be a Shymalan film although the first half plays so mysteriously that keeps you wondering \\"where is this movie heading\\" and what has all of these seperate stories got in common. PT anderson's amazing direction of the story makes us believe there is more to this and there is a higher plan in all of this that we are not seeing. But plain and simple this is still just a story about those seperate characters who often have a single of multiple connection to the other characters in terms of aquantainces and relationships. I enjoyed the film for the pure art of the film making of it and the amazing element of suspense that is bred into the story which keeps us guessing on where the story is heading. The movie ends in a sequence of scenes of biblical proportions. Although the matter in the story is little, the style and execution of the screen play is eye candy. I loved this movie. It's one of those 3 hr movies which you can actually see again right after you finished your first viewing. Extras include - behing the sceens dairy of the production, interviews with actors and PT anderson and the co-writers of the movie. This one is an all time cult classic for me.     regards, Vikram

0446577391|5.0|I have been a big fan of David Baldacci since first reading Absolute Power many years ago.  Although I have enjoyed every subsequent book, I found that some of his later works were rather weak.  So I was pleasantly surprised to discover that with Stone Cold, Baldacci is back to his old form.<br /><br />Stone Cold is Baldacci's third novel involving the Camel Club and is actually a sequel to his last book, The Collectors.  The Camel Club is a group of four senior citizen misfits who form a secret conspiracy watchdog organization.  They are led by Oliver Stone, who at one time was a CIA assassin named John Carr.  Someone is murdering members of the Triple Six Division, the CIA's group of assassins, and making them look like accidents or natural deaths.  Stone determines very quickly that these deaths are anything but accidental.  When one of Stone's former colleagues in Triple Six lets leak that Stone is actually still alive, Stone must go undercover and find the killer before the killer finds him.  At the same time, Annabelle Conroy, a professional con-woman who also appears in The Collectors, finds herself in great danger when a rich, powerful and ruthless casino owner who she swindled is seeking revenge.  Stone can't help Conroy and also help himself, so he asks for the assistance of his Camel Club buddies as well as his Secret Service agent friend, Alex Ford.<br /><br />In all of Baldacci's books, he shows his knowledge of life inside the Washington, DC beltway.  In describing a building project downtown, he writes \\"And in keeping with Washington's stellar reputation for efficiency and integrity, the project was only years behind schedule and only several hundred million dollars over budget.\\"  Also, when Stone is getting ready for a shootout, \\"he always aimed for the head.  People couldn't<br />survive without a brain.  Although it did seem that more than a few people in Washington managed to do so quite nicely.\\"<br /><br />I will be anxious to see if Baldacci will continue his Camel Club series.

B0000028M7|5.0|Well what can I ad thats new, nothing that what. Hands down my favorite rock cd of all TIIMMMMMMMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! Its dark, gloom, depressing and with a build like that you would not think this but catchy, go figure. Its so torchurd the pain in the mans voice as he sing its beautiful. Look I really get off on this kind of music, I wish the world had more bands like this. But    the world couldn't handle it. This is not everyone's cup of tea. But, If you love dark music like I do buy now. Dirt and Angry chair my two favorite songs. One more thing you know it was a different time period when this album came out. Angry chair is probable the most evil sounding song on the record and they released it as a single. I couldn't see that happening now. Latter
B000RG1NW6|5.0|There is so much that can be said about this slim novel by Mr. McEwan, but assuming that most reading this review have yet to experience it, I will say simply that it is, undoubtedly, the best of 2007. Beautiful and absolutely haunting. I'm still thinking about it months later. A sad story to be sure, but so elegantly drawn, so specific and direct in approach. No filler, no exaggerated drama, but instead profound observation offered through fascinating word choice, sentence and paragraph structure. A masterful novel on every level by a truly great writer. I rarely gush but On Chesil Beach is a must-read.
0060578793|5.0|Overall this is a great book. Not just for survival but for an appreciation of the small details of the outdoors. How do birds fly heading to and returning from water, where is water likely to be found, what are the requirements for survival?    As others have noted this is the ultimate survival manual written in an easy to read format.  Beyond that it contains a world of general knowledge about the outdoors, living outdoors, what's good, what's bad and how to tell the difference.       Even if you never plan to be out of range of a 5 star restaurant the book is a fun read. If things go bad you are better prepared and if this is in you kit you are well prepared with the information needed to survive.     Great gift for inquisitive kids who might in future years be on a safari in Africa, trek in Tibet or bike race across Australia.     Highly recommended
B00007GZQI|3.0|I saw this film once before, and thought it was in Black & White. It was filmed, for fans of the two stars, on the tail end of Sellers' swinging 60s films like \\"The Party\\" & \\"The Bobo\\", and in between Ringo's work on The Beatles' landmark \\"White Album\\" and the film/album/lawsuit \\"Let It Be\\".  Essentially, Sellers and adopted sidekick Starr go about usurping stiff British affluence by using their unequalled wealth to be rude and piss people off, stating that \\"some people will do ANYTHING for money\\".  A haphazard script and direction notwithstanding, this is an interesting art/statement film.  Noteworthy are separate scenes featuring John Cleese and Graham Chapman (of Monty Python fame) is excellent bits about mangling a Rembrandt at Sotheby's and bribing the Oxford Crew team to crash into and fight with the Cambridge Crew team -- during their race.<br />I give it a 3 because the DVD offers no subtitles or alternate languages; a commentary from Ringo, Cleese, or even the director might've been nice as well.  It's really a no-frills package of a rare film.  But it's worth a price of less than $12.00, I'd say.
0393061310|4.0|Jared Diamond's work gets to the heart of the question: how did Europeans come to colonize most of the modern world when the Africans and Chinese had such a long head start in human history? The interesting answer is not[[ASIN:0393061310 Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]], but rather how Europeans came to acquire those advantages much more quickly and efficiently than other societies (Native Americans, Africans, etc.) The four-part answer begins with the advantages of a dominant East-West axis (which Eurasia has) versus a dominant North-South axis (which Africa and the Americas lack). This East-West axis leads to greater success in food production, a sedantary lifestyle geared towards creating and accepting new technologies and diffusion of useful inventions, thereby giving the ability to outnumber and outfight societies who lack this natural geographic advantage. Diamond is an anthropologist who spent over 30 years studying the myriad ethnic groups of Papua New Guinea. A modern-day historian could never have written so broad a work. Diamond does not hesitate in going back tens of thousands of years continent-by-continent explaining what was and how it came to be. He makes good use of the 400 pages and is dead on most of the analysis.<br /><br />Alas, Diamond's greatest strength is also one of the book's weaknesses. There is a tendency to go in extreme detail in cases where this is unnecessary to make his point. There are many more pages on the various language families (and subfamilies, and sub-subfamilies) of various regions of the world than what is required. While this might be extremely appropriate for a scholarly journal, Guns, Germs and Steel is clearly intended for a mass-market audience. Occasional pacing aside issues aside, Diamond's work is surely a must-read for those grand historical debates that come up frequently politically-oriented social circles.<br /><br />The updated 2005 edition includes an epilogue chapter detailing the role of Japan in Guns, Germs and Steel.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|\\"The Lives of Others\\" is the best film I've seen in the last decade. Possibly in my life. And it's in German. This is the single most powerful, profound and complete commentary on how a government not only governs people--it determines the course of their lives, pursuits, even their thoughts--that I've ever seen. It is a treasure, and I can't even pronounce half the names of the characters properly.<br /><br />I can't think of many other movies it resembles. The director mentions Dr. Zhivago in the commentary, though only as an example of a similar genre (both are historical fiction). Maybe Reds, or The Conversation.  In the world of literature, fans of Milan Kundera and Thomas Mann will be kindred to this film; it strikes a similar political-social tone, asks those Big Questions, and delves into how our daily expectations (of which politics are inextricably tied) affect who we are.  And, at the same time, it lays bare the lies of fascism--of any system that claims the choices we make don't matter.<br /><br />Set in East Germany, the main characters (the late Ulrich M&uuml;he, playing the spy HGW, most of all) are condemned to be human--that is, to have free will and be aware of it--in a world where State power is arbitrary, rights imagined, and the moral order absolutely equivocal.  In short, to possess life when life itself is superfluous, a life that exists for the state, and never the other way around.<br /><br />But this is far more than a political think-piece, it is a genuine edge-of-your-seat thriller. The plot is remarkably well-paced, and strikes a perfect balance of deliberate stillness and action-oriented coincidence. Lots of moving parts, but they work together well and, ultimately, believably.<br /><br />In fact, some of the most harrowing parts of the plot, about a spy (M&uuml;he) monitoring the lives of a writer, Georg (Sebastian Koch), and his actress girlfriend (Martina Gedeck), mirror M&uuml;he's real life. In the terrific director's commentary, Henckel von Donnersmarck tells us that M&uuml;he himself discovered, after the wall fell, that several of his fellow actors were spies planted by the Stasi, and his own wife (and mother of his child) was an informant against him and his friends for 6 years. I don't know how his own history affected him while filming, all I can say is, M&uuml;he delivers one of the most layered, subtle and compelling performances I've ever seen, and his death breaks my heart because it reflects an immeasurable loss of talent, experience and humanity.<br /><br />The entire cast shines: in sensual vulnerability (Gedeck's Christa is incredible), comedy (Udo), even in alarming dourness (Georg's neighbor).  There are white hats (Georg and his brave friends), and black hats (the slimey Minister) that drive the action along, but it is really the people who are far from heroic, yet who have, at times, \\"truly heard this music\\" (HGW, Christa)--they are the ones who make this film so indelibly rich and fulfilling.  Condemned to make impossible choices, they don't always act honorably--and you can't take your eyes off them for a second.<br /><br />In addition to the superb director's commentary, the DVD includes a 30-min interview with the director, a 20-min \\"making of\\" featurette, and several deleted scenes.

The author did the excellent jobs for giving critical analyzes and objective descriptions regarding to the different leaders' (North Korea, China , Soviet, USA) political motives of provoking or fighting in the cruel Korean Civil War.     The book is very sufficient to tell the vivid experiences and memories  of the American soldiers.    It is one of the excellent Korean War reference books in the stands of Political ways. Also, the readers are able to experience the bitter memories of American soldiers.     On the contrary, this book is not an ideal military history book for the military history readers because the book does not provide sufficient and detailed  descriptions and analyzes of both military strategies and tactics in the  Korean War.      It is quite a pity that the readers may misunderstand that the author has a bias based on the views of the United States.The readers are easy to figure out that the book has a little bit or none of the N. Korean and the Chinese references and sources.       The author is innocent. On the contrary, only the totalitarian Communist Parties were guilty because they claimed many sources as the national secrets and did not allow the public to access it. It was one of the weaknesses of the book, although he is an accountable historian.
B000PTYUQG|3.0|I own the old box set.  True, it takes up a lot of shelf space.  The recordings are exactly the same as this set, presented in the exact same order. So I thought I'd buy this new set and sell the old one.  But I decided I would NEVER give up the old set to save money without the texts or information contained in the booklets included in the old set.    Virtually every booklet in the old set has comments from Stravinsky on his own works.  Some of these comments are priceless -- he dryly notes that since the premiere of his Variations (Aldous Huxley in memoriam), \\"the music has been analyzed more than it has been performed.\\"  Don't you want to read Stravinsky implicitly acknowledging and defending the mediocrity of The Rake's Progress?    How on earth can you listen to Les Noces coherently if you don't know the voices interchange parts?  Renard loses its humor and zip without understanding that Renard the Fox is dressed up as a nun -- but how would you know that unless you read the stage directions included?  Persephone and Le Rossignol, both gorgeous musical works, are hopelessly lost in translation unless you know French, and understanding the texts add to the beauty.  It goes on and on, because Stravinsky wrote a lot of vocal and choral music.    These booklets are just as valuable as the music itself -- they provide context and clarity to what is being presented.  Other reviewers look at this as a minor flaw.  Unless you have a deep and intimate knowledge of Stravinsky and his works, I think it's a huge shortcoming; the original booklets aren't minor trifles.  They're several hundred pages of text and pictures that really add depth to Stravinsky's work and life.    5 stars for the music, sure, except the Oedipus (as other people have noted, the recording here is AWFUL).  But I insist that you should try to find the original release of this box and buy it.  Or beg, borrow, or steal it from someone -- then you'll realize how much is missing here.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|The show itself - well there's not much to say that hasn't already been written. It's a fantastic show!    The DVD transfer, however, is one of the worst I have EVER seen.  Absolutely terrible quality, almost unwatchable in fast-moving sequences.  I would have expected better!  It's jumpy and there are artifacts everywhere.  Even on a small screen, it's almost nauseating - the cinematography is beautiful, just hard to watch on DVD.  I'd suggest getting a good DVR and recording it from Showtime.  Skip the DVD and download it or record it from TV.
B000063JDE|5.0|Being a fan of David Lynch films, I guess you'd think i'm a bit crazy to have left this particuler film to last, but yes I did leave it to last and I most definately am crazy because this film is definately all that it is cracked up to be. If any film was to prove David Lynch can accually direct a straight forward film, this is it.<br /><br />Blue Velvet is a visual masterpiece, David adds that little bit of craziness to an otherwise straight forward story and gives it that much more meaning. Through sybolisation and character emotions the film sends a message that all good things have an underbelly, a dark side etc. Every good man will be put forth to deal with someone evil.<br /><br />For myself, I found the film very confronting and through two hours of mystery, violence and emotional practise I found myself connecting to the story. At large the film is a wake up call to just how bad some things in life really are, you're just not looking hard enough.<br /><br />I mark Blue Velvet as one of the truly original films of our time. It has everything any film could possibly want to offer, action, suspence, horror, mystery and romance and in the end will leave you with a very warm fealing. It is a film that needs to be watched. Enjoy!
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|This animated musical about a house cat and an alley cat who team up to stop a petnapping is not quite a classic, but still fine family entertainment. Likewise, this \\"digitally enhanced\\" treatment isn't going to give us the pure colors of a full digital restoration, but it still should make the film look decent.<br /><br />Bonus features include:<br />* The 1946 Disney Figaro cartoon \\"Bath Day.\\"<br />* A virtual kitten game, similar to the virtual puppy game on the new [[ASIN:B000YERP2S 101 Dalmatians]] DVD set.<br />* A read-along version of \\"The Aristocats\\" picture book.<br />* A featurette on the Sherman Brothers, the tunesmiths responsible for nearly every memorable Disney song of the 1960s.<br />* A second featurette, titled \\"Backstage Disney: The Aristocats Scrapbook.\\"<br />* A deleted song.
0765318741|4.0|A great twist to the end-of-the-world story at a time when such stories were not even cliches.  Similar in dry, almost depressing style of the Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road,\\"  Matheson takes us into a hard world of survival and dread, where the protagonist fights lonliness and fear, and the loss of human companionship.  He deftly weaves in some mumbo-jumbo science to convince us of the possibility of \\"real\\" vampires, and then gives a credible twist ending.  Bravo!  Can't wait to see the movie!
0307276902|3.0|So much didn't ring true to me:  Crystal Meth user in the early 80's?  The root canal scene? The flight to the rehab? The uncanny detail and recollections?  Alas It was indeed a page turner and so  much did hit home and have a real smell - from  my secondary expereinces with rehabs.  I would recommend this book (among others) to someone who has a loved one headed to or in rehab as an insight.
B00005ONMO|4.0|Giuseppe Sinopoli, conductor/composer, meet Gustav Mahler composer/conductor. This encounter is often interesting, sometimes pallid, and other times almost infuriating. Such were Sinopoli's and Mahler's output, so it's par for this symphonic course. Four stars for guts, perhaps three or three and a half for the execution.     For my money, the Eighth is the glory of this set. It may be the most exalted modern recording of this work. It wraps up so much: propulsive interpretation, exquisite vocals, and excellent sonics. It is curious then, how Sinopoli's handling of Mahler's other choral masterpiece, the Second, is almost completely undistinguished. It's there. It begins and it ends, but little sticks in the mind or heart. So far, win one, lose one.    Others stand out in various ways: the Fifth is characterized by shimmering, almost metallic tone painting. The first of Sinopoli's Mahler recordings, it impressed, and sometimes stunned,  most listeners with its palette. Countering this was a somewhat meadering finale in which Sinopoli wallowed about. Still, very good. He also scored points in the Seventh, a problematic work in which the conductor infuses an almost dreamlike quality. This 20th century quality worked to less effect in the 9th, however. Listeners will need an open mind if they are to embrace the overall experience. I've tried, but the interpretation, which downplays the composer's red-blooded farewell, never got under my skin.    Others are mixed bag: the First conveys a superb sense of atmosphere and excitement (but not quite as good as a video performance in which Sinopoli gets the Vienna Philharmonic to play like demons possessed. As of this writing, someone had posted the finale on YouTube. Watch it, and pray the rest becomes available). The Fourth and Sixth have their moments, but are plagued by intermittent tempo bloat, in which Sinopoli succumbs to his occasional temptation to both propel and distend. Approach with caution.     Das Lied von Der Erde has alot to recommend it in terms of transparency and symphonic sensibility. It was not generally released in the US, so its appearance here is welcome.    The individual recordings in this set were recorded over an approximately ten-year span from the mid-80s to the mid-90s. My review encompasses the symphonies (including Das Lied von der Erde)which I heard in their original releases over this time. I see no indication that they have been altered or remastered for this set, but generally the sonics are pleasingly vivid.    If you are building your own Mahler cycle for the first time, a box set is probably not the way to go. Bernstein was identified with this composer, and produced two cycles (1960s New York for Sony (then Columbia), and a 1980s traversal for DG in New York and Vienna). Despite his affinities for Mahler's angst-ridden romantic side, the set(s) were not any more consistent than Sinopoli's.     I second the other reviewer's enthusiasm for much of Kubelik's Mahler, which is often overlooked. Bright and propulsive, it was not in universal favor during the 60s/70s, when the classical crowd was bent on experiencing Mahler's suffering and hand-wringing. Listening to it today, I find alot to admire in Kubelik's tighter symphonic focus.    Overall, this set is recommended to those who are studying Sinopoli's output (much of which is worthy), but as a definitive Mahler traversal (if indeed such a thing exists), it should be more carefully considered before purchase.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|This is an other great port over into the Blu-Ray realm. Excellent sound as is mostly usual and expected on this format. The resolution and flow of the movie technically is very good. If you liked the movie on regular DVD then you will love it on Blu-Ray. The effects and action sequences really pop out at you creating an emersing suspension of dis-belief. That allows you to get past the whole vampires versus were-wolves aspect. I would definately recommended it for any fan of action/sci fi/horror type movies.
B000WGZGNS|2.0|Now, I have to say that, as much as I enjoy Beyonce as entertainer. This concert didn't do much for me as a fan. I saw this concert when it first aired on Bet. But, I fell asleep during the first half hour.But, I was also still in and of consciousness during two hour broadcast Then I said I want to see her perform \\"Flaws &All\\" \\" Up Grade You \\"Beautiful Liar\\"ect. But, all this concert turned out to be was alot short skits. And to me if I wanted to see a show based on skits. I would have wanted to go see comedy show like \\"The Flip Wilson Show\\".    But, if there's anything good to be said about this concert is this, to see Beyonce empowering woman by introducing  her all female band members indididually and giving them there moment to shine. Was not only empowdering for me to see as a woman But, a beautiful sight to see. And not to excluded my gentleeman they did a great job as well. The only high light in this concert for me, other then What I have already just expressed is the \\"Confession Skit\\". The other problem I have with this concert is the sampling of other artist music during her show. I would only get this concert if I were a true blue Beyonce fan.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|A rat that wants to be a chef. He lives in rural France, and finds himself in Paris. Soon, he is helping a young restaurant apprentice make his name as the Greatest Chef in France. While the story is a bit unbelievable (its a cartoon after all!), the execution is brilliant.<br /><br />You would never want to find a rat in your kitchen - after watching this, you really start being more sensitive to the feelings of these gentle beasts. Yes, they ARE hungry monsters, but they are quite cute while they're at it. Even if you're not a food lover or a rat lover, chances are you will be charmed by this highly imaginative and creative film.<br /><br />Five Stars for the movie, and the glorious French title song.
0439813786|5.0|It's books like these that I'm excited about sharing with my daughter.  I've found that children's literature is often far more elegantly written, more compelling, and instills more of a sense of wonder and the pleasures of reading in me than many an adult novel does.  This novel fits the bill not only because it creates such a tantalizing mystery that is doled out in perfectly timed amounts but because it is also chock full of astonishingly beautiful sketches and some intriguing photos and stills from some of the first films ever made.    Selznick's book begins with a familiar device in children's literature: our hero is an orphan boy who is forced to fend for himself and who longs to connect to the spirit of his father.  His dearest possession is a book full of sketches of the complex inner workings of an automaton that Hugo is convinced holds the key to his future.  Hugo is a character for whom the reader can really fall.  He is resourceful, smart, and truly pitiable.  The book also contains a vivid cast of characters from the mysterious man who operates the train station's toy booth; to Etienne, the kind-hearted film lover; to Isabelle, the first person with whom Hugo forms any sort of connection since the death of his parents.     Perhaps the most predominate theme in the book is that of magic, although it's not magic of the wand-waving sort.  Instead, the book explores the themes of the magic of new technologies as well as the magic of family, friendship, and love.  Throughout the story there is a underlying theme about following one's passion.    The aforementioned sketches serve to enhance and enrich the story.  There is a great deal of emotion and movement in the sketches and the book works not only as a form of literature but also as a form of art.  Selznick is prodigiously talented and I spent a good deal of time just gazing admiringly at the way he managed to use black and white pencil sketches to capture the gleam in Hugo's eye during one of his happiermoments.  I felt I could take the sketches from the book, frame them, and hang them on my wall.  This is a simply gorgeous work that adults and children alike are sure to enjoy.

B000OCZD5G|5.0|In a world that has been destroyed by War Max(Mel Gibson) is on his own.  The sequel to Max Max starts off when a small intro for those who are unfamiliar with the story.  The setting is Post Apocalyptic Australia.  The dry, barren landscape makes the perfect home for this world of destruction.<br /><br />The story begins with action and the pace doesn't let up from there.  Max is being chased by a group of violent road pirates.  Out to steal the most valuable resource in this new world, fuel.  Fuel becomes scarce as people still use vehicles in this barren landscape.  Max has been toughened by the War and then losing his wife and child.  This toughness makes him able to take on these bandits.<br /><br />On Max's journey he meets a comrade who at the threat of dying is more willing to show him the way to a fuel refinery.  The refinery is the most valuable commodity in this world.  It then becomes Max's toughness that gains the trust of the people who live in the refinery as they are threatened by the large group of road pirates.  Most of the story continues in this direction and the action is never lacking.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of this movie is beautiful.  The picture is excellent and the sound has been greatly improved which make this movie even more enjoyable.  The extras that are included are rather limited.  You get an intro, the theatrical trailer, and commentary.  Thankfully the movie looks great so that is more than worth it.<br /><br />If you love action and good fast paced movies The Road Warrior is excellent.  This movie set the pace for the action genre.  There is little dialogue and all the stunts are real.  In the age of digital effects this movie is a breath of fresh air.  Mel Gibson shows the world why he is such a great action star and this movie shows why it doesn't take an incredible budget to make a great movie.
0783116934|5.0|This is one of the best true crime dramas I have ever  seen. I was mesmerized by it when it was first shown on HBO and again when I bought the DVD recently. Set in Russia,it is the story of one of the most prolific serial killers ever.  The screenplay is outstanding and, as far as I can tell, basically accurate.  The chemistry and interplay between Stephen Rea as the forensic pathologist turned police detective, Victor Burakov, and Donald Sutherland as the Russian colonel he reports to, is outstanding.  Apart from the fascination of the story itself, it is their relationship with each other that adds immeasurably to the quality of the film.  After having visited Russia, I would note the bureaucracy depicted is quite realistic.  I noticed one of the other reviewers complained that Stephen Rae never smiled.  In fact, it would be quite abnormal for a Russian to smile in public. It is a highly autocratic country and, again, the Russians take orders from those above them quite seriously. It says much about the character of the people by the scene near the end where the killer is finally caught because the  the soldier who was on duty at the train station had been there for 36 hours when no relief was available. Despite that,he persisted in following orders and checking the traveler's papers as instructed. The supporting cast is also excellent and some of the very best scenes are near the end when Max Von Sydow (as the psychiatrist who helps obtain the killer's confession) also interacts with Sutherland and Rea. I dislike the murder scenes but presumably they are difficult to avoid in a movie like this and at least are fairly brief.  This is as good as any feature film in this genre that I can think of.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|I borrowed Rome from a friend last year since I do not get HBO. I was immediately hooked to this show. It is very entertaining, with fantastic costumes, scenery, and character personas. While not a show you would want a child or young teen to watch (they're definitely not afraid of showing nudity), most adults cannot help but enjoy the story as it unfolds.<br /><br />The normal price of these two sets sold together is fairly high, but if you can get it at a sale price (like today's deal of $60!), it is well worth the expense.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|First thing first, the movie is amazing. Smartly written by Tony Gilroy (who wrote and directed another good one recently, Michael Clayton), Paul Greengrass does what he does best again as a director, with his signature hand-held camera, and actors are pretty good too (especially David Strathairn as Noah Vosen). Also, it was cool to see the last scene of Supremacy in a completely different texture.      But does anyone notice that the film's cut a little, compared to theatrical version?  (I'm not 100% sure, so I'm posting this to sorta confirm.)  I can't point out everything that's cut, but these are some scenes I think they are shortened.    1.The hand-to-hand fight scene in Tangier. In the bethroom, when Bourne chokes Desh with a towel,      I remember the choking was much longer and there was more struggle by Desh.    2. At the training facility, Bourne faces Dr. Hirsch. When CIA guys finally arrives, Hirsch tells him something      like \\"Only the truth could hold you long enough.\\" This line was cut in DVD. I'm pretty sure about this.    Additionally, runnig time of this cut is about 1hr 46m, while the DVD case indicates 1hr 56m. Even if you  count credits (and usually you don't), it's still short. So, if anyone else notices it, I hope somebody could enlighten me.      Anyway, again, this is a great action-thriller film. It works very well as the finale of trilogy.  They used scenes from previous series appropriately, the story wraps up everything. The last scene, Bourne  floating in the water, is quite clever - Remember the series started with Bourne floating around in the ocean.  I would say Greengrass, the director, has a lot to do with this quality. Check out his other great works like Sunday bloody sunday, United 93 (dramatizing real events is his specialty).    Though I'm absolutely sure there will be more Bourne films, Greengrass or Damon might not be there.  So, enjoy while you can!

B000O599ZS|5.0|This is one of John Ford's and one of John Wayne's best movies.  It is a classic--but dark and ambiguous.  It deserves to be rated as one of the top American movies of the past 100 years. Whenever I watch it, I end up having a different reaction to the movie and its characters. And that is one characteristic of a special movie.<br /><br />Others have commented on some of the symbolism--the doors.  Ethan, John Wayne's character, always seems somehow \\"outside.\\"  And that is a part of the movie's power.  At the outset, he visits his brother and family; he shows off money and it is not at all clear that it was legitimate.  Ambiguity: The source of the money? Where he had been?<br /><br />His brother and wife are killed in a Comanche raid; the daughters are taken prisoner, one of whom is killed shortly thereafter. The other, played by Natalie Wood as a teenager, ends up living with the Comanche.  And Ethan's attitude toward her is, as one might guess, ambiguous. If he finds her, what will he do? The scenery in this movie is awesome, filmed in Monument Valley, a discovery for location by John Ford (he filmed a number of his classic Westerns there).<br /><br />Ethan and Martin (played by Jeffrey Hunter) become searchers, looking for the surviving daughter.  In the several years covered, we come to be familiar with the stock players in the John Ford industry (such as Ward Bond and Harry Carey, Junior) and find that Ethan and Martin are continually thwarted.  Then, they receive information that suggests her location.<br /><br />The Texas Rangers under Ward Bond and the advance trooper from the cavalry contingent (well played for humor by Patrick Wayne, the Duke's son) make the effort to rescue Ethan's niece.<br /><br />And then the ambiguity toward the end.  What will be Ethan's stance toward his niece?  How will Martin respond?  A powerful ending.  And then, at the close, a door.<br /><br />In this movie, there is more complexity and ambiguity than one often finds in Westerns.  Native Americans are less stereotyped here than in other Westerns (including Ford's movies); the hero (Ethan) isn't really a hero; there is no wonderful happy ending.<br /><br />Perhaps the ambiguity and the symbols of doors and so on are part of what makes this a special movie.  While Native Americans are not as stereotyped as in other movies, they are still not portrayed particularly well. There is grimness to the movie that can wear on one.  But that is also a part of the movie's strength.<br /><br />So, all in all, a classic Western, and one that is more subtle than most of its genre.than in other Westerns (including Ford's movies); the hero (Ethan) isn't really a hero; there is no wonderful happy ending.

207030602X|5.0|This book is incredibly easy to read in French. It was the first book I ever attempted to read in French, the language is simple, but the ideas bigger. I think that it illustrates how one might live as un être en soi, instead of an être pour soi, as we ought to be. Meursault's existance is an ontological horror, he exists for others. He will write a letter that is sure to cause unjust injury to a woman, just because he sees no reason not to please his friend Raymond. He will marry a woman he doesn't love just to make her happy. This is like hte behavior of a dog trying to please its master.   horrific, contagious thought pattern.  5 stars
B000WTNCQS|3.0|I'll let you read the other reviews for the details on the set.  This is a warning for those who buy the deluxe box set.    I can't comment on the quality of the new mix of the CD because it wasn't in the deluxe packaging box it shipped in.  Yup, you read that right.  When you buy the \\"Joshua Tree Deluxe 2CD/1DVD set\\" it may not contain the actual CD that spurred the whole set in the first place.  I'm sure Amazon will replace it with no hassle, but it may be a PITA if you buy it for someone as a Christmas gift.

B000VLE3IS|5.0|Where's the sense of reviewing an album filled with material that every right-thinking human being must already own? Well, let's not forget those under 20s out there who may have yet to experience the full majesty of the band who set the benchmark for stadium-packing epic blues/rock. And, just days after the most hyped reunion gig of all time, Mothership lays it all out in chronological form.<br /><br />Born from the ashes of the Yardbirds in 1968, Jimmy Page joined with fellow session Player, John Paul Jones, and hotly-hyped West Midland youngsters Robert Plant and John Bonham This was alchemy of the highest order. Plant and Page's love of West Coast psychedelia, folk and primal blues was bolstered by Jones' savy arranging and Bonham's powerhouse drumming. Within weeks the first album was born. Already it contained the seeds of their greatest moments: The bite of \\"Communication Breakdown\\", the blues of ''Dazed And Confused'' and the folksy thunder of \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\".<br /><br />An ability to turn every live event into a trip through rock's back catalogue meant that the USA fell within months of hard touring Combined with with Page's now fully-matured Les Paul attack. Plant's wailing on \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Ramble On\\", brought forth his now forever famous wail.<br />Now asssured of their place as rock gods, the band used the freedom to explore their softer side on III. They drew on their love of SF tricksters like Kaleidoscope as well as English pioneers, Fairport Convention. Unfortunately this is where Mothership falls way short; opting to include the harder numbers rather than gems like ''Gallows Pole'' or ''That's The Way''.<br />By Four the band were unstoppable. \\"Black Dog\\" (tricky time signature yet hypnotic as hell), or the multi-part epic of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\": It all seemed so easy. To cap it all, \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" showed that their mastery of the blues was now a genre in itself. A juggernaut of ambient darkness, it's no wonder that people began to mutter about pacts with the devil.<br /><br />On Houses Of The Holy the experimentation went a little awry. \\"No Quarter\\" is another dark classic but it's a mystery as to why compilers still include the dreadful cod-reggae of \\"D'yer Maker\\" (though Bonham's drums are jaw-droppingly amazing).<br /><br />No matter, Physical Graffiti showed the band still had it in spades. \\"Kashmir\\" is eastern mysticism for the masses while \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" now added funk to their arsenal, and it worked.<br /><br />Well-documented tragedy followed, yet Presence was still awesome.

1932100660|5.0|The China Study covered over 650,000 Chinese over a ten-year period.  The United States contributed almost three million; while the Chinese contributed almost six million.  If it had been done in the USA...it would have cost us ten times as much.    It was the largest study of diet and its repercussions ever done.  With all the conflict of interest in America...it probably never will be done here.    This book is one of the most important health books that I have read in 47 years of research.  Many of the people I love received it for a holiday gift this year...
B000Q66PXE|4.0|The first season was riveting, second season not quite as intense but still great.  The acting was terrific, and the characters were colorful.  I wish HBO would make a third season.
B000000WA4|5.0|Amazing album that I would have to say is THE BEST ALBUM EVER due to its limitless string of great songs I can't find one song on this album with any flaws.
B000BZIT5M|5.0|This Royal Opera La Boheme is sterling in every way. Shicoff and Cotrubas are complete musicians first and foremost, and the singing is unconquerable. Neil Shicoff is one of the great tenors of his or any musical age, and his unfailing musicianship makes his singing beautiful beyond many others of more fabled estate. Perhaps no other singer (except Caballe and Ludwig) was more loved by orchestral musicians than Ileana Cotrubas, in equal measure for her impeccable musicianship and an unforgettable voice that carries a glow of tragedy deep in its emerald sound. She's a perfect verismo singer, though curiously few acknowledge it. With Cotrubas nothing is exaggerated, nothing out of pulse; she invests it all in actually singing, eschewing 'showing us' her singing - an unfortunately prevalent malaise. Thomas Allen's Marcello is bright and ardent, &the leaving scene with Rodolfo works up some vocal fire. Zschau exerts herself as Musetta, but not without delight. Gardelli marshals the Covent Garden forces with typical Royal Opera understatement and gets a huge ovation at the end. A traditionally staged Boheme recommended with passion to just about everybody. The singing's exceptionally bracing and beautiful. Cotrubas' revealing death scene can change your mind about Puccini. I think the VHS version has better sound, but the DVD is fine. I urge you to give this production a hearing.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Terry Gilliam is not unlike Tim Burton; both have an highly visual (rather than verbal) approach to telling stories. The story itself is less important than the imagery it inspires in their minds. So they sometimes choose weak or thin scripts (eg, \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Baron Munchausen\\"). \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" is, unfortunately, one of those weak scripts.<br /><br />The idea of the Grimms being con artists who take advantage of their knowledge of M&auml;rchen to defraud people by exorcising \\"spirits\\" of their own creation is farcical, which works against the seriousness of the real-life horror story they're dragged into. This might have worked if Gilliam had gradually adjusted the film's tone from light to dark, but he fails to do this -- there are too many comic characters and too much humor throughout. We're not sure whether this is a comedy or a scary fairy tale. It winds up being not much of either.<br /><br />There is one moment of marvelous pre-irony (???). After Jakob (Heath Ledger) has restored Angelika with a kiss of \\"true love\\", Angelika suggests that he do the same to his seemingly dead brother Wilhelm! Ledger tentatively leans over to deliver the buss, but Wilhelm (Matt Damon) awakes and tells him not to. And in the commentary for a deleted scene, Terry Gilliam remarks that it was removed because it rendered the film's structure \\"broken-backed\\". Weird.<br /><br />\\"The Brothers Grimm\\" is worth seeing once, simply for its magnificent cinematography and production design. But it's not very satisfying as either a comedy or a fantasy.
0740748475|5.0|Lovers of the popular characters will enjoy hours of fun with this complete edition. Plus, excellent materials were used, including high grade paper, a color frame around all the strips, and solid binding. Book One has an introduction from the author himself, giving info on how Calvin and Hobbes came to be. The only drawback is, if you like reading in bed you'll find the volumes just too heavy to hold. Their bulk makes it a little tricky to slide them out of their case, too.  All in all, en excellent gift to C&H fans, provided they're adults. Though there are some color pages, boasting the fantastic Watterson watercolors, these are NOT books for children. The bulk, the weight, and the price make them more suitable to grown ups.
075640407X|5.0|Once in a rare while a book comes along that is so good one almost dare not review it, knowing it cannot be done justice by a mere few lines of praise. \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is just such a book: a delight for a jaded fantasy reader who thinks perhaps the best have all come and gone, but to his/her surprise finds a new star in the fantasy constellation.    Without giving away the plot, this book is the first \\"chapter\\" in the story of Kvothe, a legendary hero presumed dead by many. From his childhood with his parents' travelling theatre troupe to his time learning magic at the University (a place with ten thousand times ten thousand books), with street children, thieves, whores, storytellers and musicians, and the threat of the Chandrian, a mythical (or are they?) people set on destruction, the book has everything any fantasy lover could desire. The system of magic is inventive and appealing, the plot moves believably, and the characters are complex and engaging. The voice of the narrator, Kvothe, is entrancing throughout and the reader's empathy and identification take place quickly.    This is one of those books one would read cover to cover in one sitting, if one could stay awake long enough. This is a book one wants to curl up with, maybe with a hearty bowl of stew... I actually read it a second time right after finishing it---something I haven't done with a single book in over 10 years---THAT's how good it was.    If you love Robin Hobb, Raymond E. Feist, or Terry Brooks, then chances are this book is just waiting for you to read it.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I can't understand why all the negative vibes on this LP.    To me it's genius. And note, I don't have any of their previous gear; perhaps I am un-blinkered in this respect.    Yep, on the first listen it's like, what is this sound. But I have played it dozens of times. Just when I say OK, get to bed it's late, the next song kicks in and before I know it, I've spun the whole album.  A lot say Sick Sick Sick is the best cut; nah, it's probably the weakest however I can see why it might appeal to the 'masses'.  Era is not one to play at a party but more of a glass-of-port on your own listen.     Production wise it's way cool. Very dense, layered and quite the wall-of-sound. OK, it may have been  pro-tooled heaps but whats wrong with that?   It needs a good stereo system to really appreciate the work gone in to it. Do yourself a favour and don't play it via the i-pod.   I'm going the extra step and buying this album on vinyl. After-all, in this age of 'hot' CDs, who knows what the mastering guys did with it. FIngers crossed the vinyl version has been mastered to suit.    Being in New Zealand's South Island, I doubt I will ever see these guys live but for those who are on their tour circuit, man I wish I was there.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|As always, I'm very impressed by the work of Pixar and Disney. Ratatouille is yet another in a long list of awesome movies for kids and adults alike. Even if you don't like rats, you'll find it hard not to fall for the \\"Little Chef\\". Definatley worth 5 stars. I'd give 6 if they'd let me!
B000RHKARY|5.0|Not only is this a superb recording, but it has many bonus cuts.  These cuts are NOT contained on the Hard Road re-release, as stated below.  (I'm holding it in my hand & the tracks are completely different).  While many of the bonus tracks do feature Peter Green, at least two feature Mick Taylor on guitar.  The lineup was changing almost daily in 1967...read all about it in the CD booklet for Crusade.  A must for any Mayall fan!
B000002OX7|5.0|This is the best album of the who, which makes it one of the best albums in the history of music.
1592289444|5.0|This is the heartfelt memoir of a Polish man who escaped from a Russian work camp. What a wonderful thing it is that an account like this is now preserved in published form! This is a very emotional work and also a very well-written one. The writing style is rather vivid and even to a degree poetic. Either the author is a very talented writer or he got some good assistance! I'm afraid this review can't do justice to the book. Get it and read it yourself!
B0009A40ES|1.0|I had the misfortune of seeing part of this disturbing film on cable the other night. I saw the part where Christian Bale has two women in his apt. performing sex acts on each other, while he directs their every move and films them and himself.  It was totally degrading and gross.  I turned it off after watching in disgust for a few minutes.  What a misogynistic piece of garbage.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah has developed a new way to enjoy smooth jazz, with the simplicity and the delicacy of her voice that takes her performances definitely to another stage; most of the lyrics are rather simple but profound and sometimes she makes you sight without noticing...<br />...I need no soft lights to enchant me<br />If you'll only grant me the right<br />To hold you ever so tight<br />And to feel in the night the nearness of you...<br /><br />When I listen to this song, I recognize myself in its lyrics and I feel the nearness of you (B). This diverse blend of conventional jazz, pop, folk and country might be the secret of her success. I strongly recommend this album.
B000VL9XNI|4.0|The dvd's...very cool. The highway to hell tour poster...nice. The other doo-hinkies are junk. No guitar pic. On a 1 to 10 scale...I still give this a 10. True ac/dc fans will appreciate this for it's content; hard-charging, ELECTRIC Rock'n Roll. Blues-zee too. There is one spot where Angus and Brian are being interviewed, and the interviewer makes a comment regarding David Lee Roth's comments about Van Halen VERSUS AC/DC;  You see David, then back to Angus, who nonchalantly couldn't give a sht.  It's awesome.   Gone shootin? Two versions. Phil Rudd? Genuine tough guy. Oh..and the rare high school footage stuff. Very awesome.  Need I go further? Bottom line....Entertainment treat.
B000W07EKW|5.0|Wow! These 3 films are just terrific! I read the first Ludlum novel (IDENTITY) in 1980, and I've been an avid fan ever since. The 1988 TV miniseries with Richard Chamberlain was pretty good, but then came these 3 films, and now, for me, Matt Damon simply *is* Jason Bourne. This package has all 3 Bourne movies+extras in a \\"Swiss bank account\\" box, complete with a cool mock-passport that has a special extra inside--a 4th disc with a nice bio of Robert Ludlum. And the silver box looks great on my DVD shelf. I'm 50+, but I feel like a kid again.    As for the 3 movies themselves, what can I say that hasn't already been said? They're great. Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass are fine directors, and they seem to be inventing a new way to film action thrillers. The cast is first-rate, and the action sequences are among the best ever staged. The scripts have cleverly updated the original novels to reflect current events, and there's just the right somber, serious tone to them, especially regarding the central character's search for answers about his former life. There's been a lot of argument about the lightning-paced editing and the naturalistic lighting and the hand-held cameras, but I think these elements give the films their sharp edge and constant sense of immediacy. And Damon's portrait of the tormented hero is one for the books. Any way you look at it, the Bourne trilogy is incredibly intelligent, entertaining, state-of-the-art filmmaking. (And you'll love the cool packaging, too!) Highly recommended.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of the original album - in fact, it's one of my favorite albums of all time. I've listened to it hundreds of times, whereas I've \\"only\\" seen the movie perhaps a dozen times. I also have perhaps a half-dozen LZ bootleg concerts on record, and I must disagree with those, including members of the band, who claim that this was an average concert. The versions of No Quarter, The Song Remains the Same, and Dazed and Confused on the album are perhaps the best that I've heard of them in concert, this Stairway is the definitive version, and the solo at the end of Celebration Day on the original album is by far the best version of this song ever. Since I've Been Loving You from the movie and this new album is also perhaps the best version of this song that they've recorded. Granted, Heartbreaker, The Ocean, and especially Misty Mountain Hop are subpar and the other songs are merely average (although Whole Lotta Love does have a few very special moments), but still this would have to rate among their better concerts.    The things I like about this new issue are:  1. It includes the 2.5 songs (Black Dog, Since I've Been Loving You, and parts of Heartbreaker) that were included in the movie but not on the album. As I mentioned above, the second of these should never have been omitted from the original album in the first place.  2. It includes another 3.5 songs (The Ocean, Misty Mountain Hop, Over The Hills And Far Away, the rest of Heartbreaker) that didn't appear either on the album or in the movie. Of these Over The Hills in particular is very good, although the band sounds flat on the others. The Ocean has a lot of energy, but I've heard much better versions on other bootlegs.  3. The songs have been remixed, making the bass work stand out more in particular. More jarring is how different Plant's vocals sound, deeper, with more texture, especially right away on Rock And Roll. It makes you realize how muddy the original record was -it's clearly the same version of the song, but sounds radically different.  4. Some of Bonham's great whaling at the end of songs that appeared in the movie but not the album, such at the end of Dazed, I think, are here. So is the entire violin bow part that was partially edited on the album.    For these reasons I have rated this 5 stars despite my disappointment (see below) and recommend purchasing it for fans of the original. But I must say, the original was better. If you don't have either CD, buy the older one instead.    But now here's the bad news: Instead of combining the new songs with a remastered version of the original album, they've gone back and released the audio from the film, which as any real fan knows is different from the album. Many pieces of the music (especially mistakes - my favorite is when Jones gently chides Bonzo for forgetting a beat) were cut when the album was made, but conversely many small pieces that appear on the album were inexplicably cut from the movie. Moreover, the cuts in the movie are much more obvious: Was there something wrong with the video footage that necessitated these parts being removed? The most egregious jumps occur in the funky part of Whole Lotta Love before the theremin solo, Dazed and Confused between the early vocal parts and the violin bow solo (where the movie also includes some parts not on the album instead), and in a couple of places during the No Quarter guitar solo, which really butchers one of Page's finest solos ever. Whenever I've watched the movie these have always annoyed me - now they irritate me on the album, too. Why couldn't Page have kept the parts that were cut out of both sources?    But it doesn't stop there. A lot of Plant's yelps are missing, such as his \\"Dig It! Dig It!\\" during one part of The Song Remains The Same. In fact so many of these are missing, it makes one wonder, Did Page add them from a different recording for the original album? Conversely, some of the vocals that Page wisely edited for the original album (\\"Hangman!\\") are back. The gong hits, such as in No Quarter, have been muted. Some echo effects with the vocals and guitars near the end of Dazed have been removed, whereas others have been added, such as the \\"Talk!\\" near the end of The Rain Song. And don't get me started on what they've done to Moby Dick with those flange effects. This wasn't in the original movie or album and makes the song almost unlistenable. In fact, the drum solo is so chopped up, I can't recognize it at all.    The introductions to the songs have been rearranged to conform to the movie. \\"I think this is a song of hope\\" may be the most recognizable difference, but how could Plant introduce TSRTS as just \\"This is called the Song Remains The Same\\" instead of \\"In between the last time we came and this time we managed to get an album out called 'Houses of the Holy' and...we decided that this would be an apt title for a thing that's called 'The Song Remains The Same',\\" where he mentions that they're filming? At least now we can hear \\"John Bonham! John Bonham! John Bonham!\\"    Probably the most disappointing change is the fact that they've used a different version of (at least the end of) Celebration Day from the one on the original album. Granted, it wasn't in the movie, and for all I know maybe the original album combined versions from different concerts, but it was so good, every time I listen to this new album I immediately want to play the old one just to hear this song.    Page said that he wanted this new CD to match the movie, but I have to ask, Why? So that we can play both at the same time? The original record benefited from the fact that Page could edit the concert, combining the best parts from several different performances and cutting some mistakes, as well as including parts that perhaps couldn't be included in the movie because the film was missing or damaged. Why couldn't he have stuck with these sensible decisions? I can only hope that some day another version will be released that includes the entire audio of everything that they have from the MSG shows. I know I'd buy it.
0440237688|5.0|This book is wonderful!! All the people who wrote one, two, or three star reviews didn't understand the concept of the book! I am in middle school and i got this book. When i started it, it was confusing but if you keep reading, you get the since that Ms. Lowry doesn't give away everything-and that makes it such a great book. YOU have to fill in the pieces. About the concept of releasing though-it isn't good for children under 5th grade, but it isn't as gory as many percieve. At first i didn't think of it as a gross thing by the actual process, but the fact that one of the main characters didn't give a care about it! This book it great, and just needs to be looked at in a different way than most. = )
B0002IVN9W|4.0|If you like this album, I would also recommend that you try music from another Montreal band called Les Cowboys Fringants.  They have a similar Quebec folk music base that is meshed into great indie rock like Arcade.  The only drawback is that they sing in Quebecois (French), so I don't understand a lick of what they're saying.  Also, Amazon charges for their CD's like they are imports (how hard is it to get something from Canada to the US?!?!), so I'd try and find some cheaper MP3 downloads, but well worth the money.
B000002LR3|4.0|This was one of the best albums of 1991, at least as rated by the critics. The music certainly represents a breathtaking array of influences, styles and textures that is well enough integrated for a cohesive musical statement.<br /><br />Movin' On Up  is a soulful slab of rock with lovely female vocals, whilst the next two are psychedelic trance-dance pieces. Slip Inside This House being more straight-forward tribal dance whilst Don't Fight It Feel It is a trippy, trancey number with quirky burbling synths.<br /><br />Higher Than The Sun is a slower number with atmospheric soundscapes whilst Inner Flight is even slower and more ambient with some dreamy vocals. Come Together is a mid tempo rhythmic track built around a male vocal speech followed later by oneiric female vocals.<br /><br />The tribal rhythms reappear on the long track Loaded with its mildly amusing spoken intro, appealing melody line, voice samples and bursts of sound. A drastic change in sound and tempo comes with the gentle ballad Damaged, firmly in the rock tradition with great guitars and sensitive piano.<br /><br />The next one, I'm Coming Down, is even slower and more laid-back with mournful sax, an apt description of the process named in the title. The penultimate track, Higher Than The Sun: A Dub Symphony, contains more atmospheric sounds and spacious vocals than the earlier version, and the album concludes with Shine Like Stars, a shimmering slow psychedelic number.<br /><br />It's very difficult not to compare this album with psychedelic masterpieces from the past, like Love's [[ASIN:B000058983 Forever Changes]], the 1960s psychedelia of the Stones, Beatles, Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix's [[ASIN:B000002P5U Electric Ladyland]]. Fans of Screamadelica should definitely also investigate the work of the ambient tribal house UK band [[ASIN:B000025V9H Astralasia]].

B00005JPTI|1.0|Awesome visuals do not a movie make.<br /><br />This great looking movie is a meaningless remake of \\"Omega Man\\" and light years away from Richard Matheson's haunting and weirdly relevant novel \\"I Am Legend.\\"<br /><br />See it for the amazing views of deserted New York City.  And yes, Will Smith is very good.  For about 45 minutes this movie teases with huge potential and then it descends into below average jolts of blood-thirsty mutants jumping out of the dark with their mouths open.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />In the end, super-hero-with-abs Will Smith (certainly not the relatable, ordinary man of the novel) sacrifices himself for no reason and then there's a hastily  tacked on ending of survivors entering a walled-in compound somewhere in Vermont.  Is there unintentional irony here?  Have they traded freedom for the illusion of security?<br /><br />No legend.  No myth.  And finally, not much of a story.<br /><br />I was hoping for a movie that tickled my brain as well as my eyeballs -- like \\"Blade Runner.\\"
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|I saw this show in Spring of 2007 in the States, and it was amazing.  Her voice sounded so great.  She is a very gifted vocalist who puts on a great, high energy show.  The performance was tied for my favorite concert ever, and I've seen many 'singers' who are supposed to be great.  Christina blows them all away...
B000SZLSB2|5.0|James Blunt has done it again.If any one can reach in and touch your soul this man can.He has been through allot in his young life and shares it with us in his music. Sometimes when I listen to his lyrics I feel like I knew him back in the 70's.Which of course he wasn't even born yet, so when I heard '1973' it was startling to me.Strange how he is loved by all ages and especially in this household of a 53,50,27,23,19,year olds.He has a magic within him that I have not seen in all my years of loving music and reminiscence.Do yourself a favor and purchase this CD and if you don't have his first one \\"Back to Bedlum\\" you should get it.I also would suggest getting the DVD of, \\"Chasing time:the Bedlum Sessions\\" with interviews and on stage in 2005 live concert at the BBC and 4 of his videos and the making of them, definitely worth the watch.
0375847227|5.0|The books are very well written, the story very engaging, and it's a breath of fresh air to read the books with an open mind and not be afraid of anything, but to enjoy it for what it is, fantasy and a very wonderful story!
B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture was the first time Star Trek hit the big screen.  The movie was a visual feast (for its time) and was a success at the box office.  But when it came down to it, it lacked a certain punch and was labeled as \\"just boring and too long\\".  Plans continued for a sequal, and director Nicholas Meyer was brought on board for Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan.  He was one of the many who agreed that The Motion Picture was lacking and was boring.  He had a new vision, and created a very different Star Trek movie.  The Wrath of Khan worked off a much smaller budget, but in return, gambled the Trek franchise with a very dark approach and cetainly a strong punch.<br /><br />One of the great things about The Wrath of Khan is that its a story that continues from an early TOS episode titled \\"Space Seed\\", where a gentically engineered superhuman from the 1990's named Khan failed in attempt to capture the Enterprise.  He and his men were sent to a planet known as Ceti Alpha V to begin their own desired life.  In the Wrath of Khan, we learn that the planet has nearly been destroyed, and Khan's people barely survived.  Khan blames Captin Kirk for not checking on their progress, and has a heart filled with hatred and revenge for the good Captain.  Certainly, seeing Space Seed will allow this move to make more sense, but honestly I saw this first as a kid and I still loved it.<br /><br />Khan is the main villain and the center of the plot, but there are various subplots in the film that keep the interest at high levels throughout the story.  There is a device known as Genesis that can practically create life onto dead planets.  A controversial matter is the least to worry about, since Khan is interested in obtaining this device - in addition to obtaining the life of Captain Kirk.  There is another subplot of the character development of Kirk.  He is an admiral, and is uncomfortable with the position.  It makes him feel old and worn out.  Kirk is looking for something to give him refeshment again.  Then there's Spock, who claims the good of the many outweighs the good of the one, and folows up on that with action in the film's conclusion that is shocking and moving.<br /><br />Wrath of Khan is different than the Motion Picture in every way possible.  Overall, the film has a dark tone, and that is justified with lighting and camera work.  Even the uniforms and bridge have obtained a more refined look.  There is actually some violence this time, and a creepy scene with critters known as Ceti-Eels driving themselves into human ears.  The Enterprise gets blasted like never before in spectacular space battles throughout the film against the USS Reliant (which Khan and crew have taken over).<br /><br />Just when the franchise was in trouble, a risk was taken with the production of this film, and it was a tremendous success.  Obviously, since another 8 movies have folled (and another one in production today) and another 4 television series.  Wrath of Khan shows a darker side of Trek, yet still keeping the classic feel there in the mix.  And in the end, Khan is arguably one of the finest Star Trek villains ever to hit the screen, with a must see performance by the extremely underrated Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />This director's cut includes deleted/extended/redone scenes that were not included in the original.  Trek fans will want to makes sure they own a copy of this for the distinct differences.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5m refeshment again.

B00005JPTI|2.0|Ok I just saw I AM LEGEND starring Will Smith.  I found it to be tedious, time-consuming, poorly written, largely unexplained & just  plain silly.  Most of the movie was spent just showing how along Will Smith was in New York.  That was cool for about 5 minutes, then it just got silly.  The only saving grace of this film is Will Smith's performance, which was really good.  He is a very talented actor, but the poor writing & lackluster direction show once again that even the most brillian actors need good writing etc.  The ending was too convenient.  All of a sudden 2 more uninfected people just happen to show up & they know of a colony in Vermont.  Quite honestly the entire story could have been told in about 30 minutes, plus the director tried to use cheap scare tactics instead of suspence which was also not cool.  OVerall not the worst movie I've ever seen but certainly nowhere near the best.
B00006G8HX|4.0|The third Star Trek film basically continues where the second left off.  Spock is dead.  The Genesis planet is already under study by Kirk's son David and Lt. Saavik, who are studying from the science vessel USS Grissom.  The Enterprise, is an empty house.  The children (young cadets) are all gone, and the absence of Spock left an open wound.  The events from the Wrath of Khan continue in this film, yet there is enough newness brought into the mix as well.  Overall, this Star Trek film is easily overlooked, but is one of the finer installments of the franchise.<br /><br />The story is about finding Spock, which is no easy task.  As a Vulcan, we learn that his katra (his very soul) has been exchanged into Dr. McCoy's, and remains alive in him.  Spock's body has been found on the Genesis planet, in the form of a kid.  Apparently, the Genesis effects gave Spock's dead body a new life, yet aging quickly with the planet around him.  The goal, is for Kirk and crew to recover Spock and bring him to Vulcan, where he can finally regain the life he once had.  To do so, is the real excitement of the film.  The Enterprise is being decomissioned in spacedock.  Kirk's only means of getting to Genesis is stealing the ship, with the help McCoy, Scotty, Sulu and Chekov.  They break almost every law in the book to do so.  And to make matters worse, they are confronted by Klingons who want the Genesis secrets for themselves.<br /><br />Though this film did not receive as strong as an impact as The Wrath of Khan, this is a solid follow-up.  The story remains ineresting and complex.  The action is a little weaker this time, yet still lots of fun.  The Klingons and the Enterprise engage in battle, and Kirk sacrifices the ship in a self-destructed explosion of effects that look great today.  The Klingon villain - Kruge - played by Christopher Lloyd is memorable.  And the scene where Kirk and crew steal the Enterprise is great suspense.<br /><br />If you are not a Trek fan yet interested in this film, i suggest you at least watch The Wrath of Khan first.  Although it is not necessaryto enjoy this film, it will explain why Spock is dead and how he ended up on the Genesis planet, even though there is a small scene of those events shown at the beginning of this film.  This is a great Star Trek film that should not be overlooked.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4est you at least watch The Wrath of Khan first.

0862641438|5.0|Being that I was in high school when this book was first published I don't have childhood memories regarding this story.  My mom worked for the public library and was always on top of new books of all genres when they would come out.  When members of my family would have their own children my mom would give each child this book on their first Christmas.  I was around 20 when this started and that was my first introduction to this book.  I remember when I first questioned her about this book when she came home from Christmas shopping and had purchased this for my cousin.  I picked it up and read it and was instantly drawn to the artwork.  These are not your typical cartoonish drawings that illustrate most children's Christmas books. \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" was the story I most identified with as a kid as I'm sure many more feel the same including people much older than myself.  That's a great story as well but I think maybe in the near future the torch may be passed to \\"Polar Express\\"  This is truly a modern classic regardless of what some of the negative reviewers on here posted.  I've seen reviewers comparing the North Pole scene with Santa making his appearance being similar to the Nazi rally at Nuremburg.  What a joke!  Do you people really believe that?<br /><br />As a previous reviewer wrote I think this book may actually speak to adults more than children and that kids may not fully appreciate this story until they reach adulthood.  Anyway I love this story and always read it at least once every December even though I'm on the backside of my 30's and have no kids of my own. This story has alot of heart and it reminds me of my own childhood. I'm a bit of a cynic and don't care for sappy stories and movies at Christmas.  The \\"Polar Express\\" is a breath of fresh air in the genre and how anyone can find fault with anything about this story is beyond me.  I can say the bell still \\"rings for me\\".
0446577391|5.0|Without reading any reviews, I picked up STONE COLD, and was definitely not disappointed.  This was Mr. Baldacci's best yet.  When I first started reading the Camel Club series, there were doubts on how four older men were going to provide mystery, intrigue, and adventure, but now I'm hooked.  The only down side of this book was losing a main character.  The author's other books are equally entertaining, but it is difficult to patiently wait for his new releases.  Thank you, Mr. Baldacci.
0747541604|5.0|This book is great! No matter how many people tell you how horribly sick it is. Read this book.They only say that because they dont have a sense of humor. So any way read this book! Its both sickining,funny, and tasteful.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Robert Moore at the camera, Neil Simon as screenwriter and a set of formidable and golden actors make of this movie an enjoyable film to watch.<br /><br />This sardonic black comedy begins when the best five detectives of the world are invited apparently for a dinner by an eccentric millionaire Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) with just a purpose: to demonstrate to all of them he is the number one; announcing that exactly at midnight there will be  murder.<br /><br />But the entire script is filled of funny and smart observations. Peter Sellers play the role of Wang - steals the show-  (the famous detective) , Alec Guinness is the blind butler, Peter Falk is absorbing as the vulgar Sam Diamond (in a visible parody of Bogart in Casablanca), David Niven (Dick Charleston) and Maggie Smith make a real tour de force with this intelligent satire in which we will watch to Wang, Sherlock Holmes, Columbus, Hercules Poirot, and Mrs. Marble.<br /><br />A true and brilliant comedy, and one of the three highest peaks of the genre in this decade (The prisoner of the Second avenue and Love and Death would be the other two, to my mind).
B00005JPTI|4.0|First off, I could care less about the novel. I never read it and please do not come here babbling on about how the novel was better. It probably was.<br /><br />Anyone who frequents zombie films and who is also not looking for Shakespeare at the same time will tell you as I will that 28 Days Later and 30 Days of Night are pretty much as good as it gets. Sure the old favorites are great and the new Dawn of the Dead is good too. We who enjoy such films are not used to well written scripts, above average performances, and poignant scenes with good dialogue. We are also not used to seeing too much emotion and certainly not used to seeing any thing too symbolic or even religious. For all these things are usually not in low budget zombie films. This film had some of these things in different quantities. Will Smith was good too.<br /><br />I lost myself in this film. I was there on the streets on NYC as a secret observer. It was suspenseful for me as a result of this. Was it perfect? No. Was it better than average as far as films about zombies go? Yes. Was it unique as far as films about zombies go? Pretty much.<br /><br />What did the film have that bothered me? Well for starters it had a leader zombie. Zombies do not have leaders. At least in my mind they do not. I also felt the whole sunlight vampire thing was not needed. Simply having them be nocturnal would have been fine. Raccoons are nocturnal and I have rarely seen them in daylight. Films like these suffer from too much explanation. The less that is said and the more that is implied or alluded to the better. It helps activate minds and let creative people wonder. This breeds discussion and speculation. Films like this that are done well and go easy on exposition usually stand the test of time. 2001 comes to mind as well as the Shining. When we are dealing with something we have never seen before, something that is complete fiction, less is always more. Our subconscious will fill in the rest.<br /><br />Perhaps we will see more big budget films like this.lms like this.
B0013FBS20|3.0|Will Smith is a money making machine. He always seems to pick the right film, but I Am Legend is not like any of the rest. This is a very quiet movie with little action. I respect that change of pace. As for his acting, it is good here (I usually can't stand him), but the average CGI (other than the CGI used for New York City which looked great) really took me out the film at times. The pacing was too slow for most of the people I know who saw it, but that didn't bother me much. I Am Legend is a worthy film and an even better looking Blu-ray DVD.
B00005JPTI|2.0|Excellent set up at the beginning. Really intriguing concept, except for one thing: we've seen this before, and last time, it was called 28 Days Later - and it was a lot better than this cliche-ridden, horribly executed piece of mainstream, Hollywood trash. Once the CG \\"zombies\\" appeared, the entire movie went downhill from there. I went into this expecting something halfway decent. I guess I expected too much. Films like this are the reason that I avoid big Hollywood blockbusters. Ugh.
B000V6BE6C|3.0|I thought City of Evil was better but it always seems that the album which you discover a band with is the best one and those thereafter don't measure up...  I did like this album, especially 'Lost', I love that song even with the Frampton-like vocal effects.
B00116FT6M|4.0|Everyone in the family loves this movie.  The emphasis is on high energy dancing and singing--as it should be!  The young cast is superlative, and the old movie stars Travolta, and Pfieffer good, and Walken only slightly distracting (he's miscast as the sweetest hubby in town). Although it's silly and superficial, the treatment of integration is still highly preferrable to a plot about a thwarted romance or a misplaced bundle of money or the usual teenertainment.  My eleven year old daughter is obsessed, she Can't Stop the Beat!  Girl lead, girl power, and nothing at all about shopping!
B000AARKOO|2.0|This movie was a visually stunning epic. However, the good ends there. Once again, the rich Hollywood elite have rewritten history. The Christians, and especially the clergy and Templar Knights, are depicted as crazed bloodthirsty savages. What a bucket of horse dung.   The truth be told, yes, there were some who \\"took the cross\\", in search of wealth; and, if a few infidels had to die, so be it. However, most of these men were heroes. They sacrificed wealth, life and limb to defend Christendom, often with little reward, and probably death.   People often forget that once North Africa, Syria, Persia, Turkey, Palestine, and Lebanon were all Christian lands. In the 6th century, Islam swept out of the deserts of Arabia, and conquered all by the sword--submit to Allah, or die. There was no free will.   The military orders were founded to defend Christians going on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Often these pilgrims were robbed, stripped naked, mocked, and even murdered by the Muslims--not exactly the peaceful Muslims of Hollywood fiction.   Saladin was noble amongst the Muslims. However, most Muslims were not like him. This Hollywood fiction has caused me to sit down and write books about Christian military history. I published my first one in 2005. It is called \\"The Hero of Byzantium.\\" It is about the great General Belisarius. My second book is under contract, and should be out in a few months. I called it \\"Hospitaller: A Tale of the Unknown Knight in the Third Crusade.\\" It is fact-based fiction, but it gives a much truer picture of the crusades than this fiction movie. I deal honestly and fairly with both sides. If you want the truth, don't rely on Hollywood, research, as Fox Mulder says, \\"The truth is out there.\\"  Joseph Lessard, writer
B000W1V44I|4.0|I did not know what to think when I first listened to this but upon subsequent listens it got better.  I know some are disappointed that the Boys do not sound as they used to, or that they went \\"Adult Contemporary\\" (a genre that they have had hits in, in the past).  We cannot expect the Boys to be boys forever and, of course we don't but nonetheless there are laments about the styles or songs.  Perhaps people need to give the cd a few more listens to see if it gets better.<br /><br />I noticed that the music is leaning more toward pop-rock or dance with the latter being where our Boys are more experienced.  However, the pop-rock songs bode well with the Boys too.  I noticed a bit of Maroon 5 in the styles too.  For being a grown-up album, I do not think this is bad at all.<br /><br />One thing I noticed on the technical front for this album is that Chris Lord-Alge - a mixer in high standing, mixed most of the songs.  While this may not be much of a deal to many people, I felt that it may be a sign of some sort that the Boys are being taken more seriously as they mature.  Another facet, this one being a bit amusing is that JC Chasez (formerly of Nsync) has a credit as a writer contributing to one of the songs.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this album.  One of my favorite songs is \\"Any Other Way\\"
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is the best Bond film made to date.  I have always enjoyed the other Bond films but mainly I just watched them because my husband wanted to see them. With this film, I think I actually enjoyed it more than my husband.  Daniel Craig is fabulous!  If you like Action films you will love this one.
B0000046X0|5.0|this album is near and dear to my heart because it was the one that really opened my ears to fusion. Oh yeah, I was already hip to prog bands like Emerson, Lake & Palmer, etc, but from the opening strains of Hymn of The Seventh Galaxy I knew this was something completely different. I had never heard this kind of music before and to this day remain a fusionhead. I ended up seeing this band 5 times but never with Bill Connors on guitar. Al DiMeola wasn't too shabby of a replacement though, ha ha!<br /><br />Matter of fact, when I saw them at Carnegie Hall, way back in the day, I heard that was DiMeola's first gig with the band, and super drummer Billy Cobham was seated about 10 rows or so behind me. I of course, was front row center! Sweet! I have to say this disc is a must-have for any serious fusion collection. Chick Corea is nothing if not a brilliant composer and his lines on the keys are a thing of beauty. If this disc is not in your fusion collection then that collection is not complete. Being that Connors did not stick around I will say the Corea-Clarke-DiMeola-White version of the band was THEE classic lineup, at least for me. Long live fusion, baby!!<br />[...]
B00005QDW5|4.0|When I saw this release \\"Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd\\" actually had \\"Echoes\\" on it, I realized it was time to retire my worn-out LP of \\"Meddle\\" so I could have a digital version to play on my iPod. Unfortunately the title track has been severely edited during both the opening of the song and again near the end by roughly seven minutes! What an absolute sham to title a CD with an epic Pink Floyd song and then hack that song down by 30%. I'm not a big classical music fan but I would be very surprised if any Best of Beethoven or Mozart CD's had any edited versions of their symphonies. If any of the songs on this compilation should have been kept intact, it should have been the title track.    Fortunately, there is a very nice rendition of \\"Echoes\\" on the David Gilmour DVD \\"Live at the Albert Hall\\" (also available at Amazon.com).

B00009UW0N|5.0|There's something about the vibe you get from watching this deceptively simple horror classic. I don't care how many times I see it, it never fails to haunt and thrill. Shot in Pasedena, CA, on an amazingly low budget, it truly captures the atmosphere of Halloween night in a mythical (and seemingly wholesome) Midwestern town. It does this so well, you have to wonder why anyone would bother to make a horror film today on a much larger budget. Of course, so much depends on the considerable talent and \\"realness\\" of actress Jamie Lee Curtis, and every other actor in the ensemble.<br /><br />Maybe we've just grown numb to the excessive gore and \\"special effects\\" of more modern horror films. But after reading so many other reviews here, I  have to agree that Carpenter's Halloween is simply the best ever made.
B000SNUMFC|3.0|Lisa Batiashvili is one of the most prominent young violinists, and this 2007 Sony release showcases her talents in two Finnish violin concertos. Sakari Oramo leads the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. The first piece on the disc is Jean Sibelius's Violin Concerto of 1903-05. While I am beginning to explore Sibelius' oeuvre in order to better understand his influence on later and greater composers like Per Norgard, I must admit that I don't find this late Romanticism all that compelling. I bought the disc for the Lindberg.<br /><br />Magnus Lindberg wrote his Violin Concerto in 2006 and dedicated it to Batiashvili. Lindberg's mature music has usually been characterized by a rich emphasis on harmony in lieu of straightfoward melody, as well as frenetic orchestation that exploits every instrument. Indeed, he has quipped that his favourite instrument is the orchestra. Unfortunately, Lindberg's music has been becoming considerably more mellow of late, with his Clarinet Concerto of 2003 an absolute disaster of slow lyricism, a pace which just doesn't work with Lindberg's compositional language.<br /><br />Things have gotten somewhat better in the Violin Concerto. Lindberg has been highly inspired by his old school chum, clarinettist Kari Kriikku and cellist Anssi Kartunen, and he has written a number of pieces that push those instruments to the limits. But in this piece we hear, for the first time, prominent use of extended techniques on the violin, which are often quite thrilling. The textures are more sparse than before, with a small classical orchestra lacking flutes, clarinets, and timpani, and the tempo is generally held back, so Lindberg will at least keep the fans he got with the clarinet concerto. Nonetheless, things never get too calm, and there is a powerful sense of momentum behind even the slower sections. The work has three movements. The first two each exceed ten minutes, while the third is only four minutes yet packs in quite a bit with its fast pace. In the first movement the music journeys all over the place to return twice to a sort of plateau, and this fixed point is a new matter in Lindberg's music.<br /><br />So, in terms of musical content Lindberg in no way repeats himself with the violin concerto like a certain other prominent Finnish composer (Rautavaara) is shamefully doing. Still, I wish that Lindberg would continue these new explorations in the same caffeinated vein of his earlier music. It's worth repeating Anssi Kartunnen's observation that in the room Lindberg wrote two of his great mature works, \\"Cantigas\\" and the \\"Cello Concerto\\", vitamin bottles, empty energy drink cans, and cigars were strewn about.<br /><br />It is objectionable that on this disc a label yet again exploits the good looks of a young female soloist for marketing purposes. There are no less than nine photos of Batiashvili, some in lurid poses, while the less marketable Sibelius, Lindberg, and Oramo are nowhere to be seen. And Sony tends to have the least informative liner notes of any major label.the first movement the music journeys all over the place to return twice to a sort of plateau, and this fixed point is a new matter in Lindberg's music.<br /><br />So, in terms of musical content Lindberg in no way repeats himself with the violin concerto like a certain other prominent Finnish composer (Rautavaara) is shamefully doing.

B000Y44LBG|3.0|I admit that Ridley Scott is not at all one of my favorite directors.In fact, the films that he has directed are none of my favorites.On the the other hand, the films that he has produced \\"The Gathering Storm\\",\\"Tristan and Isolde\\" and \\"The Browning Version\\" among many others are some of my favorites.This is a dilemma for me because \\"American Gangsters\\" sort of fell midpoint in my judgment.I honestly was not crazy about the story simply because druglords and cops do not generally interest me; but the real problem I had with this film is that it needed to be edited better,not only in the quality of the edits,but simply the overall length of the film.In my opinion,though an overall pleasing film that had glitzy acting (thank God Crowe was better than his last \\"A Good Year\\",also Scott),but at the two hour mark I simply began to lose interest and grow weary.What is odd is that Denzel and Crowe really only come together after the 2 hour mark and by that time I was ready to check out.That is simply my opinion.I would have kept this film around two hours.

B000Y7U98C|4.0|\\"Sunshine\\" is an involving, entertaining movie with a fascinating premise.(see plot info below Spoilers warning below if you want to find out more about it). The visuals are often stunning and the style of the film succeeds often even when the content (in the form of Alex Garland's script)doesn't. Although a bit uneven (particularly the last third of the film), \\"Sunshine\\" is one heck of a ride for science fiction fans.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br />A form of proto matter called a \\"Q ball\\" has disrupted the sun's ability to produce energy. It's dying and so is Earth. The crew of the Icarus II are sent to detonate a device powered by compressed dark matter in the heart of the sun blowing apart the \\"Q ball\\" and, essentially, restarting the sun.<br /><br />As they reach Mercury they have a number of accidents that prevent them from completing their mission. Luckily the crew finds the remains of the first ship the Icarus I which disappeared en route and can use its materials to complete their own. That's when disaster truly strikes putting their lives and mission in danger.<br /><br />Although this isn't quite as powerful as \\"Trainspotting\\" or as compelling as \\"28 Days Later\\", Boyle's film has plenty of tension and suspense. For those science folks keeping track Boyle does take liberties with the science to rachett up the level of suspense in a number of scenes but the film stays remarkably accurate for most of the science content(and given that Q Balls are still theortical and their existance hasn't been confirmed).<br /><br />The acting by the cast is terrific. They add a sense of earthiness and reality keeping the suspense level high. The visuals and production design are outstanding. Taking his cue from films such as \\"2001\\", \\"Alien\\" and \\"Event Horizon\\", Boyle and his design team create a visual fascinting world of metal and plastic that surrounds the brave astronauts.<br /><br />The DVD version looks very good with a nice transfer and the screener copy didn't suffer from the usual flaws that I see in Fox screeners. Unfortunately for HD DVD owners this is not available in that format but it is available in Blu-ray should you have a combo player. We get two short films \\"Dad's Dead\\" and \\"Mole Hill\\" that use cutting edge techniques to tell their own fractured stories.

B00005JLZN|5.0|This is an amazing movie that everyone should see. I think those who reviewed this movie in a negative manner simply did not understand it.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Wow!  A New Day is an amazing show.  I also loved the bonus DVD that came with this set.  The bonus DVD contains all the backstage footage, and shows you what she goes through each night to do the show.  The music and dancing are great!  Highly recommend this DVD.  You will be mesmerized!
B000MR9D5E|1.0|I have the BBC version. Great Show / BAD DVD TRANSFER!!! They crammed 3 shows plus extra (at least on the 1st DVD which I just watched). Don't they care? The transfer is horrible. The compression is so much you see branches on trees jerk around. There is no detail!!! I'd wait until you have an HD player and can buy one of the HD versions. Even then, there is no guarantee they won't compress the heck out of it. You really can only get a quality picture if you put 2 hrs or less on a normal DVD (remember 'superbit' ?) TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT! The people who spent years making this have to be upset.
B000VWYJ86|1.0|***WARNING***  This is a warning to all the people thinking of buying or renting this film: the whole movie is done with a hand-held camara. It makes watching this film painful and dizzy. I couln't watch more than 20 minutes of this film and then I got a real bad HEADACHE. Please be aware of this because no matter how great this movie is, the \\"jiggly\\" effect just makes this movie a real pain on the eyes.  What a shame! who thought of making this movie with a hand-held camera?
B000W796OM|4.0|Good Camera work in this installment.  The previous two by Chris Columbus were very good but they were laden with his trademark close-up shooting (as evident in the 'Home Alone' series).  The pulled back camera shows our aspiring witches and wizards as part of larger world and adds the element of mystery for the viewer.         There are some very good special effects in this film and it was one of only three films nominated for an Oscar in 2004.  'Prisoner' is also the only Potter movie to make AFI's top 400 films of all time list.      The only failure of film is we don't have enough time to fall in love with or even have the movie 'flesh out' the characters.  That seems to be the problem with all the films.        It seems that no one has made the connection that most successful Potter film was the first and co-incidently the longest. Brevity has had no effect on the success of the Potter films so I don't know why its enforced.  I sure would have liked to linger longer in Cuaron's vision of Harry Potter's world...but I guess I have to be satisfied with what I can get.  I would like another helping of Cuaron and Potter...but it doesn't seem to be in the cards.         This installment requires more thought by the viewer than the others...it probably won't be as well recieved by youngsters.  I found it entertaining and sometimes unsettling, and yet very enjoyable none-the-less.         Cheers to the 'Best' and 'Most Artistic Potter Film' to date!
B000E41MS6|4.0|I knew it was trouble when I did it.  As a middle schooler who watched Jon Pertwee and Peter Davidson on PBS and read many Dr. Who novelizations, when I Netflixed \\"The Five Doctors\\" about a month a half ago, I knew I would be completely indulging in my inner prepubescent geek.  While my subsequent trip through the available Dr.Who DVD catalog is best chronicled elsewhere, I am very happy to say that I broke my original pact with myself to hold off on this volume until I caught myself up.<br /><br />Inspired in part by a phenomenon the BBC apparently came to call American Quality TeleVision (Star Trek, Buffy, X-Files, etc..), Dr. Who has been successfully revitalized after over a decade of relative inactivity.  This is in no small part due to David Eccleson's Doctor.  He is absolutely brilliant, and I genuinely wish that he would have stayed on longer.  Eccleson is as simultaneously charismatic, eccentric, and cranky as the best of the Doctor's previous incarnations.  He also has no small bit of chemistry with his solitary \\"companion,\\" Piper Laurie.  Given time, he might have unseated Tom Baker as the \\"most popular\\" Doctor.<br /><br />The problem that Dr. Who ran up against in its original run was that it was weighed down by its own history.  Serious fans of the sixth or seventh Doctor most assuredly knew and took into account the comings and goings of the second and fourth.  This \\"reboot\\" of the series does not require that its viewers have an encyclopedic knowledge of Dr. Who's convoluted history.  However, it references the history in a way that the fan can appreciate without talking down to the newcomer.<br /><br />The Lowdown: This is a show made by Dr. Who fans for Dr. Who fans. If you were not already one, you will be after watching this season.  Then watch more - as of this writing, you will not be disappointed.  Tenant's Doctor easily matches Eccleson's, but has the privilege of long-term character development.

Each actor plays their part very well to make this show a success. This show is sure to last many seasons.
B000PFUAO6|3.0|Way back when, I took a chance on Dream Theater.  As a \\"lost\\" Yes and Rush fan in the seemingly prog-starved early 90s, I begrudgingly accepted them as the \\"new voice.\\"  Happily, they eventually released \\"Scenes from a Memory,\\" a disc that lies outside of the boundaries of both \\"prog\\" and \\"metal.\\"  It was something different.<br /><br />After its release, it seemed that the band has struggled to top \\"Scenes From a Memory.\\" As a result, Dream Theater has run up against some paradoxical identity issues.  For example: should they make \\"Scenes from a Memory II,\\" or should they go \\"back to their roots\\" to \\"rediscover\\" themselves?<br /><br />Fans of the band will recognize that they have taken the latter path. For better or for worse, Dream Theater is a band with incredibly accomplished musicians. As a result, their attempts to incorporate their influences results in a simultaneously respectable but noticeable note-by-note copy.  By paying homage to these influences, they create a \\"name-that-tune\\" experience for the informed listener.  \\"Train of Thought\\" was obviously homage to their metallic roots, while \\"Octavarium\\" was a \\"tip of the hat\\" to their more progressive influences.<br /><br />\\"Systematic Chaos\\" simultaneously extends and confounds this approach.  It is very clear when the band is trying to sonically \\"do\\" Metallica, Muse, or on a good day, Pink Floyd.  While the band's ability to recreate the style of their influences is impressive, many fans who wish to hear the potential of \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" wish that Dream Theater would quit mucking about with their influences and re-engage their personal voice.<br /><br />However, the compelling strength of \\"Systematic Chaos\\" comes from the fact that the band puts their musical quotations side-by-side.  While these disparate influences can be frustrating, the attentive listener will probably respect Dream Theater's virtuosity.  However, those of us that watch from afar desperately wish for them to coalesce their fragmented vision and re-define themselves within it.<br /><br />The Lowdown: I enjoy the album, but it does not come off my shelf much.  I would really like to see Dream Theater give up their nostalgic vision.  Despite this, I genuinely respect the way in which they reinterpret their influences on \\"Systematic Chaos.\\"e themselves within it.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|At last! A movie that is true to the book and true to the spirit of the book. Charlotte Bronte can at last be happy in Heaven! It is a carefully crafted film with an almost perfect script, flawless acting, superb direction and photography -and Toby Stephens. The film's understated sexiness truly smoulders. Well done and keep them coming.  E. McIntosh, Australia
B000WC3A0S|5.0|Sylvester Stallone made movie-history with \\"Rocky\\": as actor, writer and director. Now the box \\"Rocky - The complete saga\\" is available...a box with six great movies. Each of these six movies deserves five stars. The box deserves five stars. And I give five stars.    Yes, there have been other Rocky-boxes. The last box with Rocky I-V was great and deserved five stars. Now \\"Rocky Balboa\\" was added, to complete the series. \\"Rocky Balboa\\" deserves five stars, as maybe the best movie of the series. Yes, the new box was made to make more money... but the movies in the box are great movies all the same....    Five stars for \\"Rocky the complete Saga\\". And thaqnk you to Sylvester Stallone for this great work, great entertainment!    Walter Joerg Langbein, Germany
B000O1799U|5.0|The sole star of this film is Jennifer Hudson.  This is her film alone.  No one elso matters. Her singing of And I'm Telling you That I'm Not going is one of the true masterpieces ever recorded.  It will send chill's down your back.  Forget about everyone else and concentrate on watching Miss Hudson's performance.  A STAR IS BORN.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Rise Against is one of the bands that always seem to fly under the radar.  Lucky for me, \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" hit radios in the New York area and I was blown away.  Last I'd heard from Rise Against, \\"Swing Life Away\\" was their most noted hit, giving me the impression that they're yet another sellout band looking for any way to break into the mainstream.  This album proves that not only are they sticking to their roots, but they're only getting better with experience.<br /><br />You get a dish of hard rocking, adrenaline pumping riffs and tone setting drums in \\"Chamber The Cartridge\\", the lead track.  Tim's vocals are prominent in \\"Injection\\", a fast moving track with fantastic guitars.. It's probably one of the more underrated songs on the album, though it has been mentioned by some of the other reviewers.<br />\\"Ready To Fall\\" and \\"Prayer Of The Refugee\\" are the first two singles released in '06 and my personal favorites.  They're just the dose of medicine that rock radio needs: hard, fist pumping anthems that don't have that special \\"radio friendly\\" touch.  Rise Against has ventured from the punk scene and become somewhat experimental with their sound, a fact evident in the songs \\"Drones\\" and \\"The Approaching Curve.\\" \\"Drones\\" in my opinion has the strongest bridge on the album.  It's filled with such feeling and emotion that I could almost feel my face burning red at times.<br />Other notable songs at the end of the album are \\"The Good Left Undone\\", the third single released this year and one of the more overlooked tracks.  It has a strong chorus and awesome riffs, distinguishing itself and adding a kick to the end of the album.  \\"Worth Dying For\\" and \\"Behind Closed Doors\\" are awesome, fast paced and blood boiling songs... In fact, the only noticeably slow song on the album is \\"Roadside\\", which I particularly like all things considered.<br />To wrap it up, this is without a doubt one of the best albums I've bought in the past few years.  It's been a constant in my car and on my laptop and I'd recommend it to anyone out there who is looking for a strong, passionate, hard rocking album!<br /><br />Grade: A/A+laptop and I'd recommend it to anyone out there who is looking for a strong, passionate, hard rocking album!

0316779237|4.0|A friend, feeling that my sense of humor would appreciate such a thing, loaned me a copy of Holidays On Ice by David Sedaris.  I've heard quite a bit about Sedaris, but I've never had the pleasure of reading his work.  Holidays On Ice did not fail to delight.<br /><br />An exceptionally quick read, this book is a collection of mostly previously published material.  It contains both fiction and nonfiction alike, and at times I seriously couldn't be sure to which genre some stories belonged.  This ambiguity made things all the more fun.<br /><br />Sedaris takes a rather sarcastic approach to how people treat Christmas, and while it may seem snotty and cynical, I found it painfully accurate in many cases, especially if you read between the lines.<br /><br />While I wouldn't consider Sedaris as skilled a writer as McCarthy or Chabon in terms of technique, he certainly knows how to convey his humor through the written word, and I believe such aptitude is incredibly rare.  He is one of the few writers I've ever experienced who had me literally laughing out loud as I read.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:B000Z9VWI0 Dr. Nekros: The Tragedian (Volume I, Episode I)]]

B00004TS0E|4.0|Always amusing to read the comments whining about remaking a classic like \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\" (1947). How are these weepy rants helpful?<br /><br />Did it need to be remade? No. But the source material is good enough that any number of professionally done remakes would still be entertaining. If this 1994 version had been the original, people would already be crowning it with the classic tag.<br /><br />But it is not the original. It strikes a decent compromise by keeping many of the original story elements, deleting some, updating others, and making a few generally ill-advised additions.<br /><br />There are even some clear improvements. Elizabeth Perkins and Mara Wilson are a much better mother and daughter match than Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara. There is a real chemistry between them and the producers appear to have grasped this connection. This \\"Miracle\\" is told much more from their respective points of view and in that sense is much more their story than in the original. Wilson brings a focus and intensity to her roles that few child actors can match. She gave a similar performance the next year in Matilda. Perkins is one of those actresses you don't really notice at first, memorable in \\"Big\\" and \\"Speak\\" for performances filled with subtle nuances.<br /><br />It is no surprise that Richard Attenborough falls short of the Edmund Gwenn standard but that was Gwenn's signature role; and as much a part of cinema history as Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch.<br /><br />As long as Perkins and/or Wilson are being featured, the film works quite well. And it really only stumbles seriously during the courtroom scene and during the subplot elements featuring James Remar and Jane Leeves. The film staggers along a bit but recovers itself in time for an original and very effective conclusion. As Roger Ebbert said, while it will never replace the original; this is a sweet, gentle, good-hearted film that stays true to the spirit of the original and doesn't try to make everything slick and exploitative.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|As a \\"Firefly\\" junkie (I even knitted a Jayne Hat) I enjoyed this version of \\"Serenity\\" very much.  The best selling point was the extras on disc 2.  As with \\"Farscape\\" you sense that cancellation was not something that anyone on this series wanted and  the short sighted higher-ups kneejerked over lack of quick viewer response even before \\"Firefly\\" had a chance to establish itself.  I guess that the production quality being far more intelligent scared their tiny little minds.  But, I digress.  If you enjoyed the series, the movie will satisfy some of your questions and give you a taste of what could have been.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|First off, the third season of the show was great, and the end of the season might be some of the finest serial television ever produced.  However, the same cannot be said for the DVD set.   * The discs aren't labeled with numbers, despite being referenced by numbers in the booklets.  * For a show so amazing, there are few audio commentaries, averaging less than one a disc.  * The season finale is broken up into 2 parts, despite being broadcasted in one two hour block.    One can only hope that the LOST COMPLETE SERIES DVDs will have much more, once the series is over.
0307387151|2.0|CAUTION: SPOILERS!!<br /><br />I felt like it took over 100 pages for me to really get interested in Atonement and muddling through those first hundred pages was drudgery!!  However, once I start reading a book, I've made a commitment to finish it so I pressed on.<br /><br />Maybe because I'm am an American or because I wasn't around during WWII, there were a lot of references throughout the book that I didn't get, which was a little frustrating.<br /><br />I don't know if it was the author's intention but I don't feel like Briony atoned in any way for what she did.  I feel like she used what happened for her own end to write a novel.  The fact that she wasn't going to have it published until Lola and Marshall's death so she wouldn't be sued was more proof that she didn't really want the truth to come out but she wanted her great novel read.<br /><br />I'm a little opposite of other people in that I could forgive Briony in the beginning of the book - she was a product of her upbringing - a spoiled brat with a huge imagination.  It was later in the book that I didn't like her - especially when she was an old lady and the center of attention.  And it seemed like she felt like all she had to do was give her novel a happy ending (Cecilia and Robbie ending up together) and that would make all right with the world.  I felt she was a very static character (was that the author's intention????)  and stayed the same self-centered, self-serving person she was when she was 13.<br /><br />I felt uneasy because so much remained unexplained and so much emphasis was put on situations I wasn't really interested in (the fall of Dunkirk).  I didn't think Lola was a bad person and I don't understand why she would marry Paul Marshall and why Briony hated her so much in the end!!!! And I didn't like the way Cecilia and Robbie's death was handled - not even one sentence each - kind of a &#34;haha - I got you - they didn't live happily ever after - they both died never saw each other again&#34;<br /><br />I don't think she atoned for her childhood mistake and I would like some atonement for spending so much time on this book!!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|One of my favorite movies as a kid and now my children enjoy it too. Love it.
0790731479|5.0|\\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\\" was director Tim Burton's first film but \\"Beetlejuice\\" was the film that made people take notice as to what an original talent he is.  Think about it.  Who else could have made death so much fun?  The script by Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell may deal with the departed but it's fresh and original with ideas deliciously from left field.  I particularly liked the waiting room for the recently departed and the case worker played by Sylvia Sidney.  Bo Welch's art direction is highly imaginative as is the Oscar winning make-up effects.  Michael Keaton's ribald renegade bio-exorcist plays like a deceased stand-up comedian.  I couldn't tell which parts of Keaton's schtick was scripted or improvised.  This also the film that heralded Winona Ryder as a talent to be reckoned with and hopefully soon again.  An unqualified success.
0143038419|1.0|I can't even tell you how disappointed I am. I had read so many reviews for this book about how spiritual the author's journey is, how i just had to read it. I was so excited, as I paid for it yesterday and drove it home in anticipation. That's where it ended.     I was immediately turned off by the author's tone. That first line: \\"I should let Giovanni kiss me\\" left me questioning if the author, a 31 year old woman who is decent-looking, but by no means gorgeous, was in actuality more attractive than her vanity shot on the back of the paperback. Maybe that sounds harsh, but really, unless you have the self-confidence of Victoria Beckham and the like, thoughts like that never enter your mind, especially if you are a lowly, depressed woman who is searching for self-fulfillment but is instead flirting with a gorgeous 25 year old Italian gentleman. Was I supposed to feel sorry for her as she talks about a celibate life and going to bed alone? Isn't that why she made this journey in the first place? And then a few pages later where she actually compares her belief in God, the most superior, \\"magnificent being\\" in her words, to a dog, left me absolutely speechless.    I couldn't get through \\"India\\" without throwing this book down on my coffee table and wanting everything I had just read for the past two hours erased from my mind. In fact, I'm surprised I convinced myself to read that far. The author provides absolutely no insight into that great, big world out there where there is so much more happening than gelato. What about everything else that is going on around her? The marginalization, the poverty, the corruption, even the tourism for God's sake.     In short, I suppose I was expecting something really provocative and profound, something that would leave me riveted and aching to make a trip around the world myself. Instead I am left completely empty and will be returning this book to the bookstore on Monday. I might exchange it for \\"A Thousand Days in Venice\\" fromothers' suggestions.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. It was extremely entertaining, and while I'm aware of how and why it varied from the graphic novel, I'm still not too bother by it, and I would for sure recommend watching it. Really good acting by Weaving and Portman by the way.
0143034901|5.0|\\"Shadow of the Wind\\", is simply one of the best books I have ever read.  I am an avid reader who usually reads between 5 and 6 books a week.  When I first received this book from a co-worker I was skeptical.  I have never really cared for mystery type books or books with rather dark subject matter.  Yet, I found myself unable to put the book down.  I brought it every where with me.  If I found myself with even a minute of spare time, I had to read the book.  I found myself quite sad that the book ended.  If you are looking for a book with a clever premis that will keep you up late at night seeing what turn the book is going to take next, look no further!
B00005JNJV|5.0|I rediscovered my love of Batman because of this movie. He's such a great character, and this movie just portrayed him so well. Christian Bale is by far the best Batman I could have ever asked for. Just amazing, is the only way to describe this movie.
B00008EYA5|2.0|MT: For a bit of a twist on the usual interview, I've decided to interview SWAT the movie about the movie SWAT.<br /><br />SWAT: Hi, how are ya?<br /><br />MT: I'm great.  So let's cut to the chase: SWAT the movie is a remake of the 1970s television show.  The acronym stands for Special Weapons and Tactics, and it glamorizes the police teams that are brought in when military-style tactics are required for an increasingly violent criminal opposition. I love that kind of military drama, and SWAT has a lot of potential.  Bringing the television show into the 21st century seems like a no brainer.  So what does the movie have to offer?<br /><br />SWAT:  Well we have a returning tough guy, Sgt. Dan \\"Hondo\\" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson), who puts together a team of equally tough dudes and dudettes: Jim Street (Colin Farrell), Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Deacon \\"Deke\\" Kay (LL Cool J), and some other people that aren't as popular.<br /><br />MT: I know who's in the movie.  What's it about?<br /><br />SWAT: Oh, right, sorry.  It's about how Jim has a falling out with his partner Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) and that comes back to haunt him.<br /><br />MT: I just read the IMDB entry and it says the movie is about an imprisoned drug kingpin offering a huge cash reward for anyone who will spring him out of custody.  That sounds cool. So which is it?<br /><br />SWAT: Oh it's about that too.  That's the second part of the movie. The first part is the SWAT training.<br /><br />MT: The first PART?<br /><br />SWAT: C'mon, everybody's gotta be trained, right?<br /><br />MT: But it takes up the first half of the movie?!<br /><br />SWAT: Well, sure.  The tension builds as we watch our rookie team gel.  Will Deke run fast enough to catch bad guys?  Will Street reconcile his bad boy reputation with his strait-laced boss? Will Sanchez be tough enough to survive SWAT?<br /><br />MT: Uh, you mean Michelle Rodriguez, who also played tough-as-nails chicks in Resident Evil and Lost? It's not exactly a surprise that she can keep up, since Sanchez is pretty much like every other character Rodriguez plays in other movies.  Heck, she was even played the same character in Halo 2. While we're on the subject of actors, what's up with Street?  Is he supposed to be American?  He doesn't sound like it.<br /><br />SWAT: ...well.  See Colin doesn't really do accents.  So, he sort of has this mishmash of tough guy speak and his normal dialect.<br /><br />MT: Wow. Okay, let's forget the actors for a moment.  The tactics and training that took up the first half of the film seem to go out the window when Gamble has an opportunity to take a hostage but instead uses the woman as an anchor by tying a rope to her and jumping off a bridge.  That doesn't seem very SWAT-ish to me.<br /><br />SWAT: ... Did I mention the cool theme song to SWAT?  It's really cool. The cast hums it in one scene--*starts humming the song loudly*<br /><br />MT: Yeah, thanks, SWAT.  To sum up...<br /><br />SWAT: *stars humming the song even louder*<br /><br />MT: To sum up, SWAT is a movie conflicted about what it wants to be when it grows up.  It has a lot of attitude but not a lot of meat.  Its central conceit, the idea of a team escorting a bad guy to a destination, is excellent, but not really the kind of thing that you would expect out of SWAT...and it certainly doesn't mimic the training that takes up the first half of the film. All that, and the final fight scene is filmed in near total darkness. Rent the 1970s show if you feel nostalgic.

B00005JPLW|3.0|The movie was kind of boring. It looked alright, but the constant slow-mo then speeding up effect wore thin after the first couple times it was used. It's pretty faithful to the book, which I loved, so I really wanted to love this as well. However, it just did not work for me. This movie was pretty average.
0380715430|5.0|The fascinating, humorous, and engaging tale of how the English language grew from the peasant amalgamation of French and German (an easy, simple, and straightforward language without gendered articles) to a multimillion-dollar language spoken the world-over. Chockfull of intriguing trivia (why we can choke also is why we can talk) and important explanations (why our language has more flexibility, more words, and more intricacy than most others, but also why its spelling and grammar is so illogically insane). A great read for any English-nerd. I couldn't put this book down, and I keep recommending it to everyone I know. Grade: A+
B000VWYJ86|4.0|The shaky camera is the only thing keeping me from giving this a 5 star review. I know it was a conscientious decision by the director to make you feel as if you were right in the fight, but I found it to be too distracting. Otherwise, I loved everything else about this movie.
1593080255|5.0|In this gothic horror by the man who made Victorian England laugh to death, a beautiful young man named Dorian Gray (who shares a first name with my newly born nephew) has his portrait done by an obsessive artist. He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together. This is one of the greatest books to do the often over-used theme of appearance vs. reality. Grade: A+
B00005JLXE|4.0|To me, this is a really underrated superhero movie. I think it's maybe just a step behind SpiderMan, X-Men, and Batman Begins. You really can't expect too much when you watch these movies, so this one really exceeded my expectations. I thought the special effects and story were just superb, and yeah, I realise it's not the best acting in the world, but that's to be expected.

B000GW8VTO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie when it was released on DVD a few years ago.Now that I've joined the HD DVD revolution, this was one of the discs I wanted to get to compare to the standard offering.    The sound options are a little better with DTS 6.1es and Dolby 5.1ex on offer compared to the DVD version.Whilst none of the new digital codecs are here,sound overall is good and the battle scenes will not disappoint if heard through a half decent amplifier.Effects are well rendered with a good sense of \\"spaciousness\\" and steering of sound across channels is nicely executed.    The picture is much better than DVD,and whilst not perhaps the best HD disc ever made it is a noticeable and significant step up from plain standard definition.Colours are rich and strong and the detail on offer is superb. The contrast available is good also with the night scenes being particularly effective.In short a good viewing experience which will convince you that this HD idea was worth investing in.    I'll not comment on the movie itself too much other than to say the battle scenes (the reason I bought it)are really well done.     Well worth a purchase.
B000I5X81K|3.0|While this CD is okay, until I got to \\"Machine\\" with Herbie Hancock did I really see this guy's talent and feel like finally a song that moves.  Before that it was tear-jerker music to me.  I think if you like this guy, you have to listen to Gino Vanelli, who makes Josh sound like Mickey Mouse.  If you like the English/Foreign tracks, then you must listen to Cato by Vannelli.  It will give you chills.  I've seen Gino 7 times in concerts starting in 1977, and there's nothing like him.  It's a shame the US market never realized this talent.    Josh is good, but he's still young and doesn't have the depth in his voice yet.    Just my opinion, obviously I'm biased.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I've followed everything Nikki Sixx has done since day one of Motley Crue. What a life he has had. I strongly recommend reading the book. To me Nikki can't write a bad song. I grew up listening to his music wanting to be like him in every way possible. He was cool but yet dangerous. I'm 37 and he is still on top of my cool list. Do yourself a favor and buy the book and cd. You will not be dissapointed you did. He writes from his heart and soul. I'm glad he pulled through the dark times and is still with us today to give us more great music. Thank you Nikki Sixx.
1582701709|5.0|I am grateful to Rhonda Byrne for teaching the world about The Law of Attraction. I had followed the Hicks' (The Law of Attraction) prior to the release of The Secret. But it was the marketing genius of Rhonda Byrne that brought these beautiful messages to the masses. I thank Rhonda for that. How can the world not be a better place by thinking positively; by believing that when you change the way you see the world the world will change for you? Imagine what it would be like if we all felt like this: empowered to be all that we can be. Happy people, I bet.<br />This book has changed many lives, including mine. I was inspired by this book to map out my own journey and did just that.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I wasn't optimistic about this third installment, but it's a great film. They kept the inane car chases to a minimum, had a good motorcycle chase and a too-long roof-top parcourse chase....but otherwise it was all intelligible and cohesive action. And just the right length. The interaction with the CIA's Nikki in the first installment led me to suspect that romance between her and Bourne was in the works. Well, this \\"final\\" episode convinces me of that. And Bourne's ending also suggests fourth installment. I can't wait!
032147404X|5.0|Generally a very useful book. Each topic is presented in a bite-sized chunk, never amounting to more than a full page of text, along with an appropriate picture. It's an easy book to pick up, read a page or two at a time, and file away the hint so you can use it when you are out shooting. The humor is a bit of a distraction, but easy to get past. The tips are very useful and on-topic. Overall, a win for any photographer.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|As great as Season One is ... Two is even better! Michael Hall was superb in Six Feet Under but you'll know him forever more as Dexter after viewing Season One.     Highly recommended on so many levels. Showtime hits the mark with this one but still having a hard time believing they cancelled HUFF and refuse to release the already aired Season Two of that other gem.    Dexter ... a very likeable serial killer. Clever, inventive, well acted and always a joy to view. Sunday nights - we never miss it. Bought the box set on a hunch months ago and all my buds are now hooked. 5 easy stars.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Heartwarming movie that works.  Not they type of movie I usually like but this one was great.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|Lucas Black (the kid from the \\"American Gothic\\" TV series and the \\"X-Files\\" movie) has matured into a charismatic young actor with a brooding screen presence. He does a terrific job picking up the franchise torch from Vin Diesel and Paul Walker in this killer sequel, a well crafted guilty pleasure that delivers the Fast and Furious goods.<br /><br />Sexy, colorful, edgy, expertly paced, with a great opening sequence and a knockout ending, \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\" is formula genre filmmaking at its absolute finest. The movie has a beautiful female lead (Nathalie Kelley), cool sidekicks, wonderfully over the top villains, and a great setting (the filmmakers do a great job utilizing the Tokyo locations).<br /><br />This movie is a real rush of adrenaline. A wicked guilty pleasure that lives up to its title.
B000ZOW96Y|4.0|First,  This was a pretty good movie. It was not as good as the first but much better than the second. For 1.99 it was a good deal.    Second, Do not believe what these other people are saying. Amazon Unbox is a good service. What is so hard about this Mac users? I thought you were supposed to be tech savvy? But if you cannot operate a simple program like Unbox then maybe you should not be using any computers at all! This is very simple. You go to the movie you want, with one click you click rent, and wait for the Unbox to download it and say ready to watch (which takes just a few minutes with my internet connection). When that is done, all you have to do is click PLAY.  VERY SIMPLE. I can teach a five year old how to run this program and yet you keep crying about your ITunes which is a horrible program and sells music and video files that can only be played with MAC software. So why are you complaining that Amazon is doing the same just with Windows? Oh yes, you are okay so long as it works for you, but you through a 2-year-old tantrum if it does not go your way. Get over it. AMAZON UNBOX IS A GREAT SERVICE.    Third, The only thing I would ask Amazon to do in the future is this: I hook my computer up to my TV to watch the movies and TV shows. I would like some HD options and better audio channels. Currently you only get two channel audio. Not bad for rentals, but it I am going to buy it then I want 5.1 audio.     AMAZON UNBOX 5 STARS ITUNES NO STARS (BECAUSE OF PROPRITARY USE)
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I feel it necessary for one of the first times in my buying life to comment on the quality of this CD!  Outstanding!  Each song is very good, some are already album-rock hits, but overall, I feel this will go down as one of the finest albums of this decade and one of the best ever second or sophomore albums by a rock band ..........these guys are that good!       Ties That Bind, the first song is tight and really solid guitar and bass work.  Brand New Start, the third song on the album, is really growing on me!  Buried Alive is great.  Then, of course, the second half of the record is just brilliant!  Even better than the first 5 songs or so.  Rise Today is a killer song with a great sing-along chorus and a beautiful little lead signature riff from Tremonti.  The chemistry between Tremonti on lead guitar and Myles Kennedy on lead vocals and rhythm guitar has given this band layers and layers of extra creativity.         The sound is just beautiful and Kennedy's vocals, trust me, you will forget all about Creed and Scott Stapp!  No mean feat, since Stapp himself is quite a good vocalist.  But Kennedy has excellent range and brings way more emotion and melody to the choruses.  His vocals
B0000024W3|3.0|[i]Self-Portrait[/i] an odds & ends collection of relaxed covers of quiet folk standards, with some too-sweet backing vox overdubbed for good measure.  It sounds in places like a Jim Reeves album, which makes it a supremely and superbly odd listen.  The song choice looks random, but may have been due to the huge list of Nashville session musicians who played on the thing. Your grandpa might like it lots.  Maybe even your great-grandpa!    Musically, it's a feast for ears if you can get past these strange song choices.  I've also tried to change the song sequencing so that the album flows better, and it's tough!     The Live tracks from the Isle of Wight festival round out what was a 2-record set, and are the closest to Rock music that this gets.  Four stars for 'Quinn the Eskimo' and 'Minstrel Boy' (which begins scarily & then hits a nice easy stride).  Two stars for 'Like a Rolling Stone' (close to the most god-awful version ever recorded), and 'She Belongs to Me' (makes the point that even his electric-era standards can sound boring if played that way!).       The debate over why Bob put this one out is funny enough that the album earns an extra star for it. I think that if this album did not exist, and Dylan were to record these songs today, it would make more sense to a lot of folks...so it's 'ahead of its time' in a strange way.  As it is, I think Bob was experiencing a Neil Young 'and I'm gettin' old' moment.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|This album is definetly one of this year's greatest releases. I was never really much of a big fan of The White Stripes, but Icky Thump is pure hard rock. There's some amazing progressions from folk to hard rock. It sounds like they've put a lot more heart and soul into making this album than the others. If you're a fan of Led Zeppelin or The Doors, check this album out. It's not flawless, but it is definetly progress.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If you enjoyed the musical, then you will love this CD....is there anything more to say????
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Good Girl Gone Bad is undeniably one of the best albums around. Every track on this album is unique and everyone can relate in one way or another. Whoever said this is a typical album cannot truely appreciate the talents of an artist like Rhianna! You go girl!
B0010DRYPA|5.0|This movie will be on TCM on Thurs. 3-27 @ 8PM!    All the guests at this posh Berlin hotel come and go with their own problems. Some suffer through heartache and some go through scandal and others suffer fools gladly. There really isn't a common storyline or a thread that keeps them all together, except for the fact that they are all at the Grand Hotel! So, as you probably know \\"Grand Hotel\\" has already been released on DVD (and VHS.) But the newest incarnation of this 115 minute black and white M-G-M classic is the first and only special edition which promises to be a fan-favorite! Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford!! It can't get any better than that...!!!       You know, I really wish Warner Home Video would release the DVD cover for this film. After all, Joan was the most photogenic (not to mention photographed) movie star of the Golden Age. This extraordinarily beautiful lady deserves to have her photo shown. And in \\"Grand Hotel\\" Joan looks devastatingly beautiful. Joan was always a knockout, but in this picture she was such a hot mama. I added some photos at this [[ASIN:B0009S4IKQ link ]]for you, which includes a rare doctored picture of Joan and Greta Garbo (who absolutely refused to be in any publicity photos with Joan!!)      \\"Grand Hotel\\" had its world-premiere on April 12, 1932 which caused a huge sensation. At the time of its production, there had never been an \\"all-star cast.\\" \\"Grand Hotel\\" absolutely changed the way movies were made! This movie had a ton of first-rate stars! Joan played Flaemmchen, the sexy little stenographer! And this was one of the very few movies that Joan made for M-G-M where she did not take first billing! In fact, she didn't even take second billing; she came in third, after John Barrymore (Baron Felix von Geigern!) The true star of this picture wasn't Miss Crawford (although she managed to steal the show,) but it was the one and only Greta Garbo (as Grusinskaya, the dancer.) If Joan was the most powerful lady in Hollywood, then Greta Garbo was the most powerful woman in the world! Ms. Garbo had the balls to call all the shots while she beat the good ole boys at their own game! Also included in this classic film are: Wallace Beery (Preysing,) Lionel Barrymore (Otto Kringelein,) and Lewis Stone (Dr. Otternschlag!)      Why is \\"Grand Hotel\\" so perfect? Well, for a variety of reasons... All of the performances are so first-rate; everyone was completely supreme! When Grusinskaya looked so happy (after she fell in love) you could see that this ice-princess' cold heart (did she have even have a heart?) was actually beginning to melt! And when Joan, as the little stenographer flirted with all the men that she came into contact with, you believed her because this was the kind of girl that your mother always warned you about. Besides the first-class acting, the cinematography  was beautiful. Not since [[ASIN:B00007L4MJ Metropolis ]] has there been such a stunning art deco picture!      In 1932 Joan was just banging 'em out left and right! Besides \\"Grand Hotel,\\" she also had two other classic film debuts! You might remember, that she also had the perennial favorite, \\"Letty Lynton,\\" which overtime has become a huge favorite among Joan's fans. And, her third film of the year was United Artists' [[ASIN:B00011D1MC Rain]]. Of course you know that Joan never forgave herself for making that movie because it was a huge flop. But again, over time this picture has earned a huge cult-following. More than a quarter of a century later, when asked about these three films Joan said, \\"Still, two out of three isn't bad.\\" As far as I'm concerned Joan never had anything to be ashamed of! And, I dare say that Miss Crawford pitched a perfect game with three out of three masterful movies in '32!       2008 will surely be just as much Joan's year, just as '32 was! I am so elated because besides the new \\"Grand Hotel\\" DVD, there's also a lot more coming out. Joan has her [[ASIN:B000XNZ7NO second boxed set ]]that will be out onFebruary 12. This will include some of her greatest pictures, such as: [[ASIN:B000XUUQPG Sadie Mckee]], [[ASIN:B000XUUQPQ Strange Cargo]], [[ASIN:B000XUUQQA A Womans Face]], [[ASIN:B000XUUQP6 Flamingo Road]] and [[ASIN:B000XUUQQ0 Torch Song]]!!! All of the movies in her boxed set will also be offered individually, on DVD, too! And, 20th Century Fox  is finally releasing Joan's '47 classic, [[ASIN:B0010KHOSK Daisy Kenyon]] on DVD; look for this in March! Here's hoping Johnny Guitar will finally be released on DVD, too! There is also going to be a new book about Miss Crawford which is sure to be one of the most comprehensive and thoughtful books ever written about this talented and larger-than-life superstar; Not the Girl Next Door: Joan Crawford, a Personal Biography (written by celebrity author, Charlotte Chandler) will be out on February 5! And the paperback edition of \\"Hollywood Martyr\\" will also be out in Feb., too. (I am not crazy about \\"Hollywood Martyr,\\" but at least it's not a character-assignation, like most books about poor Joan always are.) I am just beside myself because finally Miss Crawford is being recognized for the talented Movie Queen that she always was!
B000VWYJ86|1.0|The third installment in this trilogy had a good plot, although a bit disappointing to me at the end.    After watching this movie I had a headache from watching the hand held camera bounce around in all of the action scenes throughout the movie. It was very irritating trying to follow the action when the camera was constantly bouncing around.  I would have rather had them spend the extra cash that is required to film scenes using cameras on tracks, etc. which would have given the movie more clarity, especially in the fight scenes which Matt Damon handles so well.
0195170776|5.0|NOAD is the best single-volume American English dictionary I know. In my opinion, the best single-volume dictionary of the English language is the British dictionary entitled Collins English Dictionary in Color.<br /><br />I have over ten abridged desk monolingual dictionaries; NOAD stands out in my shelf altogether with Collins followed by The American Heritage.<br /><br />NOAD impresses because of its contextual examples. They are based on a corpus incorporating over a hundred millions words. The best dictionaries support on linguistics corpus because they use natural examples that bring English to \\"life\\". That is, this corpus has millions of sentences extracted from authentic spoken and written language.<br /><br />According to the official Oxford site, all their dictionaries are based on huge linguistics corpus -- over one billion occurrences.<br /><br />If you are interested, however, in purchasing the best unabridged dictionaries for a reasonable price; I would recommend the \\"Webster's New Third International Dictionary\\" and \\"The Compact Oxford English Dictionary\\", 1991 -- the most authoritative sources of the English language.
B000065BPB|5.0|These are by far the best headphones I have ever owned.  There are higher-end headphones if you have lots of cash to drop, which I don't, but these are excellent quality headphones that are definitely worth far more than they're selling for.    I have a small head (I wear a size small hat), and these are snug on my ears.  They're not tight, but rather comfortably, well, snug.  The ear pads are soft foam and completely enclose my ears.  When I have them on and my cat is right next to me meowing away, I can't hear her (If it does the same for crying babies then these will come in very handy in the future).  All the key parts that can easily break or wear out can be replaced, which is nice to know.    As far as sound, these things rock.  Music that I've listened to hundreds of times sounds better than ever, and I have even noticed a few things in some of my music that I never noticed before using these headphones.  Bass is clean & deep, even turning it all the way up on my pc.  The entire frequency range was clean & clear.  I bought these specifically for my pc, where I play games & listen to music.    I am totally happy with these and highly recommend them - especially at this price.

B000E97X66|5.0|This is actually not my favourite Springsteen-period; I prefer the 1978 and 1981 tours and the material from \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" and \\"The River\\". (For God's sake, Bruce, release the 1978 Passaic concert on CD and DVD!)   But this is just such a phenomenal concert, so full of energy and power and intensity. Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band play like there's no tomorrow, and the sound is magnificent, clear and crisp and probably better than what the 5,000 people at the Odeon in West London heard on that night more than 32 years ago.    The music encompasses both the grand and the gritty, moving effortlessly between tender, soulful piano ballads and furious, breathless hard rock. Pushed forward by the keyboards of Roy Bittan and Danny Federici and the pounding drums of Max Weinberg, the E-Street Band tear through pulsating, burning renditions of \\"Lost In The Flood\\", \\"She's The One\\" and \\"Born To Run\\", and swing and swagger on the Van Morrison-inspired Jersey soul of \\"Spirit In The Night\\", \\"Backstreets\\", \\"Rosalita\\" and \\"Sandy\\".   There's even a bit of actual Van Morrison tacked on to the 17-minute \\"Kitty's Back\\", a snatch of his classic \\"Moondance\\" from the album of the same name.    The set opens with a sparse, tender and desperate \\"Thunder Road\\" and closes with a tough, driving and slightly ragged \\"Quarter To Three\\", propelled forward by Clarence Clemons' sax. Great, great stuff. And just about everything in between is equally great. Some may find that a couple of numbers are overlong, but with performances like these you can surely forgive a couple of minutes of indulgence.   Four and three quarter stars. A magnificent live recording.
B00005JPTI|4.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is not a film that sticks closely to it's source material.  While that is it's biggest flaw, it is also where it shines.  If you ha told me two years ago that I'd get misty-eyed watching Will Smith sing \\"Three Little Birds\\" in a big budget motion picture I'd have laughed myself silly, but this adaptation of Richard Mathson's untouchable novel that -while itself being a vampire story- inspired the entire zombie film genre as we know it takes the story we all know whether we've read the book or not and turns it into an exceptionally personal affair for all of us.  One man.  One dog.  A familiar metropolis deserted by day, but crawling with death by nightfall.  This is our setting and it's one that never gets old for me.<br /><br />The plague that wipes out Robert Neville's world is never fully explained, simply inferred to be the result of some sort of failed cure for cancer.  Gone from the novel and the original Vincent Price classic, [[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]], is the long struggle of Neville to save his ill daughter, his wife's tranformation, and the shocking actions of the US government to contain the plague.  What it left is simply one man, alone trying to maintain his sanity and hopelessly searching for a cure to a disease that has already wiped humanity off the face of the earth and left the \\"survivors\\" as rabid vampiric horrors.  It's sad, it's pathetic, and it's perfectly human.  Will Smith has a penchant for picking terrible, schmaltzy films to star in, but no one can deny his talent and charisma as a leading man.  Naturally, this is a film he must carry single-handedly and he does an awesome job of it; he's dramatic, he's relateable, and at times, he is funny.  The humor is that of the dark and inappropriate kind, but in a world like his, that is all there is left.<br /><br />The vampires/zombies/infected in this are all CG and more than a bit reminiscent of Gollum from [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]]. I'm not a fan of these kind of effects when practical would have been more effective and was acutely aware of the fact that I watching computer-generated monsters, but they worked nonetheless.  The infected prove to be terrifying foes for Neville to face, combining suprising cunning, inhuman strength, and impossible agility (hence the CG).  Their only weakness is that sunlight kills them almost instantly.  Neville plays a game of cat-and-mouse with them, gathering supplies, researching  cure, and searching for survivors by day while making sure to get back to his fortified apartment before nightfall when the creatures come out to hunt for his hiding place.  More than a few shades of [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]] are present in this film, which is funny considering the book and it's film offspring are largely what provided the elements of that film.  So I guess the genre has officially come full circle now.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's the personal touches that make \\"I Am Legend\\" such a treat.  Bob Marley provides both the soundtrack to Robert Neville's day and the inspiration for his work, which is both ironic and uplifting at times.  This may sound strange for a horror flick, but if you are a fan of Marley (himself a [[ASIN:B00005Y23E Legend]]) it makes all the sense in the world as you watch.  Watching Neville attempt to interact with mannequins he's set up as he returns the movies he rents (in alphabetical order, one at a time) and seeing him snap when one of the figures is moved is both amusing and, at times, intensely disturbing.  When relief finally comes, Neville finds he has lost the ability to interact with other humans at all and is relegated to performing lines from \\"Shrek\\", which is playing on his television at the time.  The ending is a complete 180 from the book which is disappointing, but not as corny as it could have been.  The novel [[ASIN:0765357151 I Am Legend]] has one of the most brilliant and darkly ironic endings ever put on paper, but director  Francis Lawrence didn't ruin it by go for the happy ending either.  The result is a compromise between the pitch blackness of the book and the cloying cheese that many Will Smith fans love.  It turns out a bittersweet and hopeful conclsion that should satisfy both while not thrilling either.  But I left the theater with \\"Redemption Song\\" still ringing in my ears and a satisfied feeling.  If only every movie could do that for me.<br /><br />\\"I Am Legend\\" fails to adapt the book of the same name to the big screen, but succeeds in so many other ways.  I can't give it a perfect score, but I will give it a very hearty recommendation to fans of Will Smith, zombies, vampires, and Bob Marley.  Enjoy.by go for the happy ending either.

0316010669|5.0|This book is conversational and easy to read.  This book has a few amazing points.  More so, I would read this book again to refresh the idea of \\"mind reading\\" by thin slicing microexpressions with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS).

B000VNMMWA|5.0|one question though, where was this edition in august? you know, when I could have bought this excellent set instead of \\"double dipping\\" as they call it. if you loved the movie to death, then this set is a must have..if you dont own it yet, what are you waiting for? it is well worth it. im willing to bet that within the next year or so, shaun of the dead will recieve the same multi-disc treatment..or at least some sort of re-issue job.anyways, the movie is great. i already reviewed the actual movie on here in may.    bottom line: easily the greatest dvd re-release of the year(since they seem to be popping up everywhere these days) add this to your cart nick and simon fans!
B000001EMW|5.0|these guys do with 4 instruments what metallica sucked at with an entire orchastra.     you can tell easily exactly what song it is. each cello harbors the melodies that are used by each of the members of metallica, including percussion. for any real metallica fan, the songs, not sure if they are on this specific album (the may be on inquisition symphony) but the quintessential metallica songs, \\"fade to black\\" and \\"nothing else matters\\" will just about make you cry because they are just so beautiful.     this band does go on to do origionals down the line, my favorite being quottmo (i think that's how it's spelled...) which is just gorgeous.     they are also a fantastic live show (i've seen them twice, and plan to see them more) that is power packed. you haven't seen a metal concert till you've seen 3 guys headbanging while playing their cellos! the closed once with \\"peter and the wolf\\" and i was blown away. it's also a show that you can take the entire family to. when we went, it was my bf and i, my brothers, and mom, and there were other families there that had 3 generations with them. parents, grantparents, children. i met people at the concert who were classicly trained cellists and loved them (the cellists in the band are all classicly trained) and also saw bam margera from jack*ss and a few porn stars. basicly, good times were had by all.     if you love classical music, metallica, or rock in general, there is no possible way to go wrong with them.
B000004166|5.0|This is one of the recordings I recommend when people tell me they're starting a music collection and want to know what some foundation CDs are.  The work presented here is clean, crisp, and strictly Mozart in every sense.  These works sparkle under Grumiaux expertise, and the LSO (with Davis at the podium) provides an well-balanced accompaniment.  There is something in Grumiaux's tone that other musicians have not been able to replicate in any other cycle -- listening to such mastery of these concertos brings a smile to your face.  The only point of criticism to offer is directed towards the cadenzas chosen by Grumiaux (which are his own).  In my opinion, they are not always the most appealing choice. and people who enjoy lots of flare in their Mozart Cadenzas may feel underwhelmed.<br /><br />For those who are looking for a more romantic rendition of these works, the Perlman/Levine cycle may be of interest to you.  Another set which has impressed me is by young German violinist Julia Fischer, recorded with the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra.  Otherwise, this CD is your best bet.
0307341550|5.0|I'm perplexed by the couple of reviewers who talk about having to stick with this novel for the first 30 pages, coming close to folding up early.  I thought Gillian Flynn's debut was excellent from Page 1.  I especially love how Flynn's narrator, Camille Preaker, slowly reveals little things about her semi-sordid past and her not-too-hot present.  As an example, there's a quick early line from Preaker about how she prefers baths because the shower stings her skin.  A short while later, we start to learn a little about said skin & you recall that earlier line.  Nice writing.  Flynn's got heaps of these little nuances, which show some great attention to detail.  It's a real treat to read something this well thought out.<br /><br />The interview with the author that appears here on this page is most revealing.  Flynn says \\"when I wrote Sharp Objects, I wasn't even sure who the killer was for a bit.\\"  That shows.  But the book isn't so much about the killer as it is about 'Miss Preaker' and her coming to grips with demons of her past.  Ms. Flynn aces that part.

They stay in my teeny-tiny errrholes better than any headphone I've ever tried and are so light I forget I have them on. And the sound quality is fantastic, esp. for the price! My only complaint is that Best Buy & Circuit City no longer carry them. Thank god for amazon. I'm stocking up this time!
0143038419|5.0|I think a lot of the people who gave this book 1 star missed some important points.  Yes, the book is focused on Liz Gilbert.  She meant for it to be about her  own personal search.  She wrote about exactly what she wanted to experience on each leg of her trip.  As for her marriage, she even says she couldn't figure out why she needed to get out.  It was a perfect marriage on paper.  It just wasn't \\"her\\" perfect marriage.  When she talks about the heartbreak and soul-crushing experiences of her divorce, she is speaking about the DIVORCE, not the marriage.  I, for one, thought she showed tremendous insight into the ways love can deep-six into hate.    That being said, I had a wonderful time with this book.  I took a very short \\"I\\" trip to Bolivia a year ago for some backpacking and culture immersion.  My focus was poverty and corruption, and boy did I get a boatload.  It changed my life in so many ways.  Now, if I went to France, my focus would be fashion and wine, and that would change my life in many ways as well.  The point of this book is not to preach.  It is to encourage women to have the courage to explore themselves.  Whether you want to eat, pray and love like the author did, or you want to cry, write and be humbled like I was, what Liz Gilbert is saying with this book is to EXPLORE YOURSELF.  Whether you do that in another country or from the comfort of your own home is up to you.    One of my favorite parts of the book (in addition to the lovely metaphor that children were wrapped in silk, \\"like gifts\\") was a theory from Liz's Italian friend that each of us has a word.  Mine is \\"explore\\", in case you didn't get that from my last paragraph.  If you are in a place that isn't compatible with that word, it may not feel like home to you.  Liz asserts that she doesn't know if that theory holds water, but she likes it.  I like it too.    I found it confusing that she switched tenses in some parts of the book, but other than that, I thought her writing was absolutely lyrical.  Her descriptions of places made the pictures pop right into my head.  I felt like I was there.  Maybe that's because I wasn't so much trying to see the actual places she visited, but was rather interested in seeing through the eyes of this very interesting woman.      I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever done a little soul-searching, and especially to anyone who has wanted to but has held off for one reason or another.  It is a wonderful book that may be a little life-changing on its own merits, if you go into it without preconceived notions.
B00005MP58|5.0|WE've watched this several times.  Seen every version made and this is the best.  The old one with Greer Garson is also excellent, but this one takes it to another level.  Too bad they don't make more movies as good as this one was.
B0000062GK|5.0|I've been listening to Satriani's music for many years, and have heard all the studio and live albums. To me, Crystal Planet is where the best elements of his music all came together.     Until his 1995, self-titled release, Joe Satriani records were all about the guitar, and little else. I've always thought that the material on \\"Not of This Earth\\" & \\"Surfing With the Alien\\" in particular sounded best in a live setting (i.e. the second disc of \\"Time Machine\\"), because they capture Satch in a group setting, rather than monster guitar embellished by weak, sterile rhythm backings. However, Crystal Planet has some INCREDIBLE drums and bass! Although I am more partial to the playing of Manu Katche & Nathan East on the previously mentioned 1995 album, CP has the best playing of his primarily rock recordings (the JS album seems more blues and jazz/fusion than rock to my ears), courtesy of Stuart Hamm  and Jeff Campitelli. Essentially, this is Joe's live group in the studio, and they are consistently great.    The most appealing quality to this recording is that Joe experiments with the structure of his composition, particularly with regards to key signatures. I recall having read in an interview that Joe intentionally designed the track listing so that the key of each song would be different. Even people who are not familiar with musical theory will notice that the first half of the disc is made up of \\"brighter\\" sounding tracks, while the second half features more \\"sad\\" sounds: this is a progression from major to minor key signatures (for example, from E major to F minor). I particularly love the second half of the album the most.    This is a high quality disc, and none of the tracks are weak. Even some of Satch's best are littered with the occasional vocal track or purposeless display of technical prowess, but this one is all about the songs and the mood. The album peaks at \\"With Jupiter in Mind\\" and never cascades from that point - it stays great and ends the same. Theguitar will always take the center stage on his discs, but here it all gels beautifully with the backing musicians. Stuart Hamm, most notably, has always been the greatest compliment to Satriani's \\"sound\\", because he can dance underneath the melodies and solos without stepping on any toes.    For my personal tastes, I rank this one above the discs that others hold in higher regard, such as \\"Surfing...\\" and \\"The Extremist\\". They are great in their own ways, and have some of his most memorable tunes, but Crystal Planet is so much more adventurous and rewarding for me than anything else he's done before or since.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Released in 1954, REAR WINDOW was a major success with critics and public alike--and unlike some Hitchcock films, which were praised at the time but negatively re-evaluated, it has held up incredibly well over time.<br /><br />Loosely suggested by several notorious crimes, the premise of REAR WINDOW is widely famous.  Photographer L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to his New York apartment with a broken leg, alternately nursed and harrassed by his elegant girl friend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and pragmatic day nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter.)  Annoyed and bored, he begins to watch his neighbors across the courtyard--and soon notices the activites of Mr. and Mrs. Thorwald (Raymond Burr and Irene Winston.)  Their quarrels quite suddenly cease, Mrs. Thorwald is no longer visible, and Mr. Thorwald is unexpectedly given to taking packages out of the house.  Is it murder?<br /><br />The set for REAR WINDOW has long garnered a great deal of attention, and deservedly so: it is a meticulous sound stage re-creation of New York apartment buildings of the era, and with few exceptions both the camera work and sound effects are presented from Jefferies' point of view: we see what he sees and hear what he hears.  In the process, we become as much of a peeping tom as Jefferies himself, a device that tends to make audiences increasingly squirm as the film progresses.  At the same time, however, we are also privy to Jefferies' private life, most particularly his rocky relationship with Lisa, who wants marriage but whom Jefferies rejects as incompatible with his own lifestyle.<br /><br />The performances here are extraordinary, with James Stewart cast against type as Jefferies and Grace Kelly sparkling as the high-fashion Lisa.  But the real stunner is the supporting cast, which ranges from the truly remarkable Thelma Ritter to the host of players who are glimpsed from Jefferies' window as they go about their daily routines: the lonely lady, the musician, the newly married couple, the scultor, the woman with the dog--and, of course, \\"Miss Torso,\\" a particularly voluptuous blonde who spends her time in what Lisa calls \\"a woman's hardest job: juggling wolves!\\"<br /><br />This is Hitchcock working at the peak of his talents, working his themes of isolation, vulnerability, and most particularly voyerism to the nth degree.  The script is tight, the cinematography is flawless, and the production designs are beyond perfection.  Critics may argue which film can be regarded as Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece, but even the most picky among them will place REAR WINDOW either at or very near the top slot--and so will you.  Truly memorable and beautifully restored on this DVD release.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerthe dog--and, of course, \\"Miss Torso,\\" a particularly voluptuous blonde who spends her time in what Lisa calls \\"a woman's hardest job: juggling wolves!\\"    This is Hitchcock working at the peak of his talents, working his themes of isolation, vulnerability, and most particularly voyerism to the nth degree.

0060527986|4.0|This one does not feel like a book (since it's a companion to The Alchemist), as there is no story, but rather a set of thoughts. It reads fast if you know the original sources so i'm not sure it's worth compared to things like Tao the Ching, The Art of War, and other classics. It may help when reading the Alchemist, at least to indicate at which level the Alchemist should be read, but alone it is simply a compilation of other works. Might be useful to read again the Alchemist after reading this one...
0143039431|4.0|Whenever I revisit a classic I'm struck by how much more I get out of it now than I did when I was 24 or 19 or, God forbid, 15.  Giving a book like the Grapes of Wrath to a 15 year old serves largely to put them off fine literature for the rest of their lives.  The depth of understanding and compassion for the human condition as communicated by a book like this is simply unfathomable to those who haven't lived much life yet, but after you've gotten a healthy dose of living, it comes across like fine music to a trained ear.<br /><br />My heart doesn't bleed for the Joads today as it might have 25 years ago.  Yes, it's grim and unfair, but it's no longer shocking or disturbing, and I can see now that Steinbeck didn't intend sensationalism to be the main point.  What he's about is revealing the human dignity, the innate goodness and unbreakable pride of these people, and by extension the American people in general, something that still resonates today, especially with reference to the working classes.  When the Joads and their kind decline government hand outs, requesting instead the simple opportunity to work hard and be rewarded commensurate with their labor (even if it means a grueling cross-country journey to a place they don't know) one can hear today's white working poors' exasperated disdain for government, insisting that they simply be allowed to keep more of their pay and not be held back in their efforts by nit-picking legalities and cultural trivialities that disapprove of their lifestyles.<br /><br />Sadly, most such people will never read the Grapes of Wrath.  Worse yet, many liberal lawmakers won't read it again after high school and won't glean from it an essential understanding about the pride and perseverance of the American working class that could benefit them in cultivating this constituency.  A book like the Grapes of Wrath should be required reading - for every American over 30.

B000V7O0GC|4.0|This is a review of the hd-dvd. This is an overall great movie but I think the filming techniques used (almost a whitewash in most of the film) lend this to be a visually interesting movie but not the greatest example of hd-dvd quality out there! I recommend this version over the sd  the picture quality is obviously better and the audio is excellent in your HT set up! over all a great product and addition to your hd library, just not a premiere showpiece like Serenity or The Searchers!! Happy Hi Def all!!
B0007XT87G|5.0|Okay, so I became acquainted with PTree through a friend of mine who made a mix CD that had everything they had done back from [[ASIN:B00000IAH0 Stupid Dream]] (and a couple of months before it got re-issued, too) and I enjoyed the compilation immensely. It had five songs from [[ASIN:B00006IU73 In Absentia]] which was where I started. I soon after got this and aforementioned \\"Stupid Dream\\" and at first \\"In Absentia\\" had those two overshadowed for me. This was a few months before the new album, by the way, that I heard all of this.    But many, many months along the line and I have to say that \\"Deadwing\\" is far away my favorite Porcupine Tree release, worthy of five full stars. It's one of my top twenty albums of all time by this point, and for a good reason. The songs on here do go back to some of the self-indulgence in progressive rock, but that's not a bad thing. This has a big variety and contary to the title it runs quite well into flight as it gets to its climaxes.    \\"Shallow,\\" the American single, is by far the most straightforward thing on the entire album. It's suprrisingly commercial but it's not a bad thing, as it has many of the band's strengths, including anthemic riffs and an awesome chorus. The verses kind of remind me of Radiohead, actually.    Things start out with the acoustic-and-electric title track which sets the tone of things pretty well. It is dark and interesting like most things Steven Wilson. Nine and a half minutes and it entertains you that entire time. \\"Lazarus\\" is surprisingly calm for following those two tracks, but it is a pretty beautiful song with a memorable chorus. I speak of these things pretty quickly I recognize but I don't think I can even get you the whole meat of these songs in an actual review.    There's other riff-heavy moments like in the wonderful \\"Open Car\\" and what's more enthralling yet in the second half is \\"The Start of Something Beautiful,\\" with its bass-y synths in the beginning and then it goes to amazing melodies as well and with Wilson's general lyrics of a family dysfunction and such. I remember one night when I took a very, very long walk in the city in somewhat cold weather and I had this playing with me and it worked pretty effectively.    Of course as a centerpiece is \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here,\\" with some awesome harmonizing a la the last album's \\"Heart Attack in a Layby\\" and is almost as strong. It doesn't really bore me or seem too excessive in its nature which is both a surprising and enthralling thing in the song.    They do recycle something from an older album, but since they make it that damn hard to get [[ASIN:B00004T1NA Lightbulb Sun]] I really don't mind that \\"She'smovedon\\" is added at the end, one of the earlier singles from a PT album. It adds nicely to the end of the album.    What you get here are ten very solid tracks worthy of repeat listens, and if it's been collecting dust I suggest you pop it in your player again because when I started doing that more the album did wonders for me. I always knew it was great but only recently have I recognized in full the total brilliance and how wonderful the thing really is. How could you not praise such a recording is something that goes beyond my comprehension. It's one thing that has to be heard to be believed. I feel a bit bad that my review can't even do the record justice, but I just hope maybe you'll come across this with a similar feeling. \\"In Absentia\\" is still amazing but that's my second favorite PT album now.
0060853980|4.0|I am new to both of these authors. I had heard of them before but never actually read any of their work. After many recommendations I decided to pick this one up and couldn't put it down. I finished this book in a good three days and am quite pleased with it! The blurred lines of good and evil, the satirical accounts of Armageddon, and the fine philosophical questions and debates regarding human-beings and Christianity were marvelous! I cannot wait to read this one again!

B0010YPTGU|5.0|This concert is currently paying ON PBS all over the USA and is a wonderful event. It was recorded in Bocelli's Home town in Tuscany and is in a beautiful outdoor setting. The songs are all the songs from his new Hits collection plus more. Andrea Bocelli, is the world's most popular tenor (and Best selling) and pop sensation as well, This set is all pop (crossover), Though some of it has a classical feel to it.<br /><br />The Songs include a nice selection of some of Bocelli's best work Bocelli has a very beautiful voice, that expresses much emotion. His tone and diction are excellent and his Volume is much better then the critics claim, he voice is always moving, his singing touches one's heart and goes right into ones soul. The tracks include Songo;; Canto Della Sera duet with Sarah Brightman; a Medley, (Besame mucho \ Somos novios - It's impossible \ Can't Help Falling In Love); Time to Say Goodbye-Con Te Partino; (with Sarah Brightman), Vivo Per Lei- duet with Heather Headley; Melodrama; The Prayer- duet with Heather Headley; and Because We Believe; a new English/Italian version of Vivere called Dear To Live with Laura Pausani a popular Italian singer; A wonderful song called La Voce Del Silenzio duet with Elisa; a beautiful song called A TE featuring Kenny G on saxophone; A very cool classical sounding song with Lang Lang, on Piano, called IO CI SARO; and another new song, very contemporary, called BELLISSIME STELLE which may be my favorite song of the new songs. Also doen with Chris Botti is Italia a new song written by David Foster and on Botti's new album with Andrea questing on vocals, and it is a beautiful song.<br /><br />The Extra Audio CD has 7 songs Italia, live version featuring Chris Botti; La Voce Del Silenzio, featuring Elisa; Medley, (Besame mucho \ Somos novios - It's impossible \ Can't help falling in love) Live version; Canto Della Terra, featuring Sarah Brightman; Mille Lune Mille Onde;  Se La Gente Usasse Il Cuore; and Domani, one of my favorite songs.<br /><br />This is a great DVD (and or set) for any Bocelli fan, for the fan because it is beautiful and has the 6 new songs (5 new and one alternative version, Plus different partners on the Duets). And is a great set for new fans because it has many of his hits. This would be a good first DVD for someone new to Bocelli.This is a great DVD (and or set) for any Bocelli fan, for the fan because it is beautiful and has the 6 new songs (5 new and one alternative version, Plus different partners on the Duets).

B000000OSE|5.0|After I just bashed the living heck out of Appetite for Destruction for being one of the most overrated rock albums ever made, the band jumps back and surprises even me with a solid collection of songs.  Song after song, I'm left totally confused how most people can criticize this album, and yet, prasie Appetite for Destruction.  \\"November Rain\\" is the most popular song, and the guitar playing at the end of it blows away everything on their debut album (and I mean *everything*).  That's one heck of a song.  The build up is brilliant, and the atmosphere is totally amazing to me how a hard rock/heavy metal band would be able to pull off something so wonderfully.     However, the enjoyment doesn't stop there.  \\"Don't Cry\\" is a really good ballad with meaningful vocals, \\"Right Next Door to Hell\\" has memorable vocals (which is where \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" failed miserably) and \\"Dust n Bones\\" almost sounds like something the old rock band Little Feat would do.  Solid songs.  Of course, this version of \\"Live and Let Die\\" doesn't compare to Paul McCartney's version in any way, shape or form, but it's decent enough.    Why most people prefer Appetite for Destruction is a major mystery to me.  Perhaps many people prefer weak songwriting and a few overplayed songs.
B00009RAJJ|4.0|Other reviewers have said it better than I could about the personal nature of this recording. This was the band left alone to get creative and bold.  And they did.  A number of outstanding songs are contained on Tusk, including the title track, Angel, Sara, Walk A Thin Line, among others.    But the best cuts are Over and Over, Brown Eyes, and Honey Hi.  These three gentle moody songs possess some of the most beautiful vocal arrangements I have ever heard.  Harmonically haunting and perfectly recorded.  Christine McVie's angelic voice blends magically with Buckingham's and Nicks'.    If only for these three gems, Tusk is worth it.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Ok, just to let you know, I'm just finishing a whole semester focusing on this book, so I feel like a bit of an authority! Anyway, the great thing about this movie, besides Wentworth being so smoking HOT (sorry Ciaran), is its appeal to Austen newbies: it simplifies and reorganizes the story so it makes sense in a screenplay. That said, if you're an Austen purist, this movie is going to kill you!     From the start, the details are rearranged, making me cringe at the lost subtleties from the novel. The very climax of the book, the all important conversation between Anne and Harville and Wentworth's subsequent letter, are broken into separate sections of the movie and completely out of order. Sure it works, but its not right! I felt I was denied one of the greatest scenes of the book! Ugh!     As for the actors, besides Wentworth being hot (I feel I must reiterate this) he wasn't necessarily better or worse than Ciaran, just a different take. Anne was mixed: one minute I hated her, the next I loved her. She also brought a new aspect to the character and I appreciated it. Everybody else, though, was insignificant. I really felt like the 95 version made even the small characters round and dynamic, and in this movie, if you weren't the hero or heroine you were blah. And whoa...way too much over-emoting.      And what was said before was true: the end stinks. Its like Run Lola Run all over Bath, and hey look, Mrs. Smith isn't crippled, so she can run alongside and explain all the junk about Mr. Elliott. Nice one guys. Yeah, so my last thought of the movie was that maybe I would at least get to see a satisfying kiss between Anne and Wentworth, and after the slow inching toward each other's face with Anne chomping (literally!) at the bit, it was finally there. So that was nice.     Ok, in summation, the 95 version is classic and timeless, but if you don't know the story beforehand you're going to get lost. This version is Persuasion for Dummies but it does have a few merits. Its worth watching, whatever your experience, but consider yourselves forewarned!    P.S. If you're hoping the new Mansfield Park is going to be better than the 99 version I think you will be disappointed. I could only stomach a few minutes before I HAD to turn it off. But then again, I kinda liked the 99 version, so who knows.

0805079831|5.0|Maybe we thought the age of ideology was over and its wars were done. But Klein examines the rise of a new ideology whose believers claim to own the future -- Milton Friedman's Chicago School of Market Fundamentalism. In recent decades market fundamentalism grew so influential globally that it seemed to be simple objectivity. But as the performance record of past ideologies exposed their biases and cruelties, so Klein feels we can now take a hard look at the new dominant ideology. With a powerful combination of historical research and activist journalism, she shows what the true believers in market fundamentalism \\"shock therapy\\" have done in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Poland, South Africa, Russia, Sri Lanka, New Orleans or Iraq.<br /><br />Probably all ideologies take the quality of medical therapies. They claim to hold the cure the patient needs. Klein shows unfolding links between developments in \\"market discipline\\", security technology, foreign policy and invasive psychotherapy. As she quotes British Psychiatrist Andrew Wyllie concerning electroshock therapy in 1940, \\"The introverted schizophrenic or melancholic may be likened to a walled city which has closed its gates and reduces to trade with the rest of the world. ... A breach is blown in the wall, and relations with the world are reestablished. Unfortunately we cannot control the amount of damage done in the bombardment.\\" (p.391)<br /><br />The therapy of market fundamentalism has required removing barriers to competition from foreign corporations, privatization of national resources and services, reduced spending on public education or health, deregulation of business activity, and very commonly suppression of dissent to all the above policies:<br /><br />\\"Wherever it has emerged over the past thirty-five years from Santiago to Moscow to Beijing to Bush's Washington, the alliance between a small corporate elite and a right-wing government has been written off as some sort of aberration -- mafia capitalism, oligarchy capitalism and now, under Bush, 'crony capitalism'. But its not an aberation; it is where the entire Chicago School crusade -- with its triple obsessions -- privatization deregulation and union-busting -- has been leading.\\" (p. 379-380)<br /><br />Much of this book makes very grim reading. But in covering recent years, Klein sees causes for hope and even celebration: \\"Throughout its' thirty-five year history, the Chicago School agenda has advanced through the intimate co-operation of powerful business figures, crusading ideologues, and strong-arm political leaders. By 2006, key players from each camp were either in jail or up on charges\\". (p. 535-537) Klein runs down lists: Augusto Pinochet died under house arrest; Juan Maria Bordaberry of Uruguay arrested in charge of murdering political opponents; Argentina's junta leaders Jorge Videla and Emilio Massera jailed for life; Bolivia's former president Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada charged with killing protesters while signing illegal contracts with foreign companies: Russia's \\"Harvard men\\" oligarchs such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Leonid Nevzlin, Vladimir Gusinsky or Boris Berezovsky jailed or living in exile, and North America's of free-market absolutists Conrad Black, Ken Lay or Jack Abramoff prosecuted. Especially in Latin America Klein sees signs of a popular return to balance between business and public interests. As she quotes Ecuador's president Rafael Correa's response to the market fundamentalist-controlled World Bank, \\"Ecuador is a sovereign country and we will not stand for extortion from this international bureaucracy\\". (p. 550)<br /><br />Reading this book I had to wonder what it all will mean for the USA. Where will the rising frustration over labour outsourcing, trade imbalances, product safety, corporate corruption, privatization of basic services, etc. lead America, which has been the world's heartland of market fundamentalism?<br /><br />--author of Correcting Jesus: 2000 Years of Changing the Storyry
B0009UC7HA|4.0|The plot of this movie is pretty far-fetched: a guy and his friend are in search of a Confederate ironclad which supposedly left Richmond carrying a fortune in gold coins. A clue found by chance seems to point to west Africa, then northwards into the Sahara desert. But there is more than a shipload of gold involved... an environmental disaster threatens the entire Earth, seemingly from the same area.<br /><br />This movie has it all: spies, corporate bad guys, tinpot dictators, high-tech gizmos, romance and even a medical mystery.

B00113XMDW|5.0|First of all, it you haven't seen The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, then make sure to watch those first. Ultimatum picks up right where Supremacy left off.  You will be completely inn the dark if you don't watch those Identity and Supremacy first.<br /><br />The government is back after Bourne and are once again sending their best agents to take him down. Joan Allen wants to help Bourne, but there is no way her superior would allow that. The story isn't nearly as original as the first 2 movies, but it is a GREAT continuation. I don't really want to give anything away, but I will say that it is very intense and has probably the best spy sequence ever filmed where Bourne is trying to help out a reporter that the government wants to kill. The action is also great. The fight scenes are the best in the series by far, and of course there is a car chase. The movie is intense throughout the entire running time. If you blink you will miss something.  If you are fan of the first 2 movies, you will be very pleased with the 3rd.<br /><br />I only had 2 problems with the movie.  Bourne has a bomb blown up right by him, he gets in a horrible car wreck, jumps out of buildings, it just goes on and on.  By the end of the movie he is limping, but it just isn't believable. I am willing to overlook that though, because the movie is just so darn good!  My only other problem is one I am sure nobody but a select few care about.  Scott Adkins has a very small role and has a fight with Bourne in an apartment, but he doesn't get to show off any of his moves.  If you have seen Isaac Florentine's Undisputed 2 and Special Forces, then you know what he is capable of.  It is a shame he isn't used properly, but it just goes to show where Scott Adkins stands in Hollywood.  I don't want to make this a Scott Adkins review, but be sure to look for him in the next Jean Claude Van Damme straight to video release called The Sheperd.  It looks promising.<br /><br />If this is the end of the Bourne series, I am fine with that. It is a good ending.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />If this was only a 4 star movie, I would probably still have to give this DVD a 5 star rating.  The special features go into very great detail on how the movie was made.  This is a 5 star movie in my eyes with or without the special features, but I was very glad to see how good the special features are.  I couldn't have asked for any more than this.

To preserve her illusions and to prevent her fragile health from collapsing her son convinces friends and former coworkers to act as though the DDR goes on and contrives all sorts of elaborate ploys to make it appear as if the communsit state is still going on.<br /><br />A fun movie, if a little bittersweet.

B00006JDSI|4.0|I've been watching Nosferatu for years, not because I enjoyed it, but because I at least respected parts of it.  Certain scenes and effects were breathtaking, even while the rest just felt laughable.  Having just seen the Kino restoration for the first time, I'm amazed to discover this is actually a very solid and enjoyable film.  Minor, but important changes, like using the correct projector speed, bring the tone and flow of this film to life in ways that had previously been left uncovered.  Moments in the film that previously felt unrelated and unjustified now earn their place, characterization and motivation come into focus more clearly, and the whole film achieves a new level of creepiness.  It's time to chuck out your $10 bargain copy of Nosferatu and make an investment in excellence.<br /><br />Here are the strengths of this 2002 edition:<br /><br />1. Correct projection speed.  This makes all the difference in the film, particularly in those early scenes that set up everything that follows.  Harker/Hutter is as hammy and over-played as ever, but instead of appearing so frantic as to make the entire film feel annoying, this Harker/Hutter, played at lower speeds, just makes you resent him enough to enjoy watching him come face to face with the Max Schreck vampire.  His manic performance no longer seems so comical as to ruin the tone of an otherwise morbid film.<br /><br />2. New title cards.  The narrative vehicle for this entire film is a book whose pages are nearly impossible to read in the old editions.  Kino has completely redone these pages, making them clear as day.<br /><br />3. Tinting.  Nosferatu often depends upon the viewer knowing when it is nighttime and when it is day, but the intense lighting of the 1920s often makes this impossible to discern.  Color tinting in this edition makes the difference quite obvious.<br /><br />4. Soundtrack.  As with most silent films, the cheaper editions of Nosferatu pair the images with seemingly unrelated and often highly inappropriate music.  This new soundtrack, while a bit too experimental for my taste, conveys the emotional tone of this film quite well.<br /><br />5. Previously missing scenes.  I felt like I saw many parts of this film  (particularly after Act 3) for the first time.  In previous editions, the additions of these scenes may have worked only to make the film seem more tedious, but I'm glad to see them included here.  They do strengthen the momentum of the film.<br /><br />Put all of this together, and you get a previously broken film that now works seamlessly.  The story is still limited in some ways, particularly with the doctor's ambiguous role in the story and a mostly unimpressive climax, but the film holds together well, and it held my interest, too.  For the first time, after watching this film for ten years, I actually enjoyed it.<br /><br />A few words of caution to those planning to buy this film, though.  I would hesitate to call this any kind of \\"definitive edition.\\"  Kino does tamper with this film in several ways.<br /><br />1. The soundtrack is very experimental.  It avoids dating itself with \\"modern\\" sounding music (like Giorgio Moroder's edition of Metropolis), but it does use sound effects and, on at least two occasions, voice, in addition to a wide array of instruments.  While all of this works, it clearly does not reflect the artistic intentions of the director.<br /><br />2. I'm not convinced the title cards are translated faithfully.  Certain lines, like the captain of the ship saying \\"I'm going below deck.  If I'm not back in 10 minutes...\\" feel disingenuous and, perhaps, too modern for the film.<br /><br />3. While the picture is clearer than in other editions, it still suffers from graininess and scratches.  It doesn't capture the \\"newness\\" that the film originally had in the same way that, for example, Kino's Metropolis restoration has.  You won't feel like you're watching this film in the same vibrant way that it was experienced byaudiences in 1922.  It would have been nice if they could have somehow corrected for the film's sluggish shutter speed, as well.<br /><br />For all of these reasons, it might make more sense to check out Kino's newer [[ASIN:B000VUQ4HW Ultimate Edition]] of Nosferatu (2007), which appears to be more faithful to the original work.  I only own this Kino edition (2002) because it came in the Kino [[ASIN:B00006JMQJ German Horror Classics box set]].  Still, this is a very good (and very creative) restoration.

B000002897|5.0|This album by the Screaming Trees contains their one big hit, \\"Nearly Lost You.\\"  I heard the rest of the album when I started dating the man who became my husband. It's still one of our favorites more than 13 years later.<br /><br />It doesn't sound dated... it's not really \\"grunge.\\" It's just really good rock. The Screaming Trees are not as well-known as some of their contemporaries, but that means those of us who are hip to them get to be in on something special. Pick this one up and join our club.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|I read only non-fiction as a rule, but really like DVDs as a way of \\"zoning out.\\"  This movie is absolutely the best of the series, and I am very much looking forward to future movies of the same high quality.<br /><br />With a 125 other reviews, there are only a couple of things that I as a former spy can add.<br /><br />1)  CIA is grotesquely incompetent, running operations out of Embassies where the gate guards and foreign nationals all know who the \\"official cover\\" officers are.<br /><br />2)  CIA is also grotesquely immoral today, presided over by a man I used to admire, Mike Hayden, who has violated the Constitution three times and is long overdue for being fired: wireless wiretapping at NSA, rendition and torture at CIA, and now the destruction of evidence relating to the latter.<br /><br />3)  There are very good and honorable people at CIA, and the two female protagonists in this movie represents all that is good about the spy world.<br /><br />This is a great movie, but to keep it all in perspective:<br /><br />1)  Most important skill in spying is typing--four hours for every hour of agent meeting, more if you have to transcribe the tape recording of your meeting with a terrorist.<br /><br />2)  The best spies are invisible and don't get into fights.<br /><br />Super movie.  I look for the CIA girl and Bourne to get married and have little spy kids down the road.
1400032717|3.0|I can see why people positively review this book.  It is very unique and different, being written in the style and voice of an autistic lad from England.  It's a well written book, and I'm sure, quite insightful, but at the end of the day, I just didn't enjoy reading it.  It was a tough read for me, and to be quite honest, reading it was a bit of a chore.  I think the book was successful in conveying a great deal of frustration, but I'm not really looking for that in a book.

B000BFH2S2|5.0|This is my favorite of Michael's CDs or DVDs so far (and Call me Irresponsible has been out a while). This is the one with the real staying power. I have watched the DVD many times.     Ilove Buble's interplay with his own band, particularly with the amazing guitarist, Randy Napoleon. Since Napoleon left Buble's band (after three wonderful years) to join Freddy Cole's quartet, this may be the last chance we get to see him with Michael.    The two of them are just amazing, particularly on my favorite song on the DVD, You don't Know Me. The DVD is better than the TV special by the same name, which replaced a valuable band member with a star--there's nothing like listening to Michael with the extraordinary talents in his own band!

0743464117|5.0|This gripping account immerses the reader in 101st Airborne's experience during WWII; all the way from training, to the eventual celebration at Hitler's nest. Ambrose primarily tells this tale through the trials and tribulations of Easy Company. Through first hand interviews, diaries, extensive research, and his own trip to the region, Ambrose is able to provide a unique and vivid narrative of war. While reading I often found myself cringing at disturbing depictions of battle, and even laughing out loud at some of E Company's quirky antics.    Although World War II was such an epic battle, and seems daunting to grasp for someone who did not live through the times, Ambrose proves that taking a microscope to the history is perhaps the best method of understanding it. Ambrose writes this piece with a passion. Based on footnotes, it is clear he developed a strong bond with the men he interviewed, yet he also retains his objectivity and supplements the first hand accounts with the exhaustive research he has performed. The enthusiasm Ambrose shows for his subject is evident on every page. 'Band of Brothers' makes for an exciting page-turner, as well as essential reading for someone looking to get a grasp on the military history of the Second World War. My only complaint is that the book didn't go on long enough. If only every history book was so difficult to put down!
B00081U7HC|3.0|For sheer escapist fun, few movies top this one. It's the age old story of the heart-of-gold hooker/fallen woman who cleans up her act and finds romance with a rich tycoon (in this case, a businessman who buys struggling businesses, and then breaks them up to sell for a profit). Along the way she softens his hard heart and he also improves as a person. Casting an often repeated predictable movie like this is so key; Julia Roberts is perfect for the part, as she makes her character, Vivian, extremely believable (well, as believable as this character can be). She injects her usual bubbly personality with just enough tears to make you root for her the entire way. Richard Gere has never been a favorite actor of mine; at times in this movie, he is spot on, at other times, he simply walks through a performance. However, this still does not detract from the light-hearted enjoyable quality of this film. Roberts is the  one to watch, anyway. Hector Elizondo gives a nice supporting turn as the Concierge who preps Roberts on becoming a lady. Jason Alexander gives a good performance as Gere's scumbag assistant who doesn't like the humane changes Roberts' character is causing Gere to take on. As for viewability, there are a few slightly steamy love scenes between Gere and Roberts and a few other adult situations; not good for little children, but fine for teens and older.<br /><br />Sadly, for this edition, Garry Marshall felt it necessary not only to include the deleted scenes, he actually inserted them back into the movie that you watch. Most people watching this know that it is fantasy escapist comic fare; adding a few scenes of street life/hookers in an attempt to make it more \\"gritty\\" or \\"real\\" only splits apart the atmosphere. If I wanted to watch a movie on LA street life, I'd rent one.<br /><br />The extras are very sparse; a blooper reel which is mildly amusing; again, Roberts' infectious laugh and humor make this short section fun. The \\"LA: Pretty Woman Tour\\" would be cool, but each location is given an extremely brief explanation. This is not anything indepth. Still, with a little help from Google, you could easily find these locations after Garry Marshall's somewhat funny commentary on these Los Angeles locales. \\"Live from The Wrap Party\\" is embarrassing; a very poor video quality excerpt of Roberts, Gere, and Marshall attempting to sing \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.\\" The whiskey bottle in Roberts' hand gives an explanation as to the context of this drunken clip. Who the heck decided to add this?<br /><br />I believe the trailer, \\"Wild Women Do\\" music video, and \\"1990 Production Featurette\\" were all on the previous edition. There are no \\"looking back\\" featurettes, current interviews, etc. that would have really added to the value.<br /><br />For the movie, I give 5 stars (the picture and sound quality are excellent!); for this not-so-special Special Edition, I give 3 stars.ocation is given an extremely brief explanation.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Especially during the current Bush administration based on using fear as a tool for votes, and using lies and deceit to accomplish their goals, no movie better hits the right note and definitely made me feel much more compelled to speak my mind and take a stand against political establishments that are more corrupt and deceiving than good and just. I like V for Vendetta because it takes place in a not too distant future which gives it a layer of realism, and the character of V is just so layered and complex that it just drives the movie to make you understand his vigilante nature, and very few movies have lines that give ya goosebumps but the minute he said \\"The people should not be afraid of the government, the government should be afraid of the people\\" I nearly stood up and cheered because man its the truth.  Great movie, go and grab it
B000OONTFU|5.0|This complete DVD set sees the Matrix trilogy finally released on high definition for the first time.  You can also get the Complete Matrix Trilogy which features just the files.  This set includes all the bonus material that has appeared on any of the DVD incarnations previously and packages them into a HD-DVD/DVD combo disc. The main downfall is that all of the previous material still appears in the 480i format and has not been given the HD treatment.  This is a shame especially when it comes to the nine films that make up the Animatrix which would have looked great in 1080p.    Overall this box set is great value for money.
B000UG4LYU|4.0|Back in 1993, this album was originally conceived as a straight soundtrack for the BBC TV dramatisation of the Hanif Kureishi novel, 'The Buddha of Suburbia'. It eventually became more than a series of instrumental passages recorded for the film due to Bowie's refound creativity and was rebuilt into a bona fide 10-track solo album. Unfortunately the album was marketed at the time as a mere soundtrack and consequently it was unfairly overlooked as a \\"real\\" Bowie album, especially when it followed shortly after Bowie's first solo effort in 5 years; 1993's jazzy 'Black Tie, White Noise'.     'The Buddha of Suburbia' is performed mainly by Bowie and multi-instrumentalist Erdal Kizilcay and begins with the title track (incidently, the only song to appear in the film); a slow-tempo accoustic piece which slowly builds with further instrumentation. Listen for the riff from Space Oddity - 3 and a half minutes into the song and quotes from The Man Who Sold the World's 'All the Madmen'. Aside from the album's instrumental pieces, these are the only salutes to his past as Bowie was then to provide a glimpse into the future, particularly the next phase which was to be the remarkable alternative-rock of the 'Outside' album, along with the odd jazz number from 'Black Tie, White Noise'.     Track 2 'Sex and the Church' (a quasi-techno piece with computer-filtered vocals and soothing sax) and track 3, the instrumental 'South Horizon' wouldn't sound out of place during Bowie's late 70's Berlin period, but with Mike Garson's piano over the top of Vangelis' Blade Runner theme. Garson would go onto provide the motif for Outside - that strange, jangling piano. Track 4 'The Mysteries' is also instrumental and in the same vein.     Track 5 'Bleed Like a Craze, Dad' provides more 'Black Tie' funk while the standout track follows in 'Strangers When We Meet'. This, although the same tempo as the re-recorded version on Outside, is significantly different and well worth a listen. For those uninitiated, this is one of Bowie's best songs since the 80's - uplifting and compassionate.     Track 7 'Dead Against It' is a melodic up-tempo song which was to give an incite into the way Bowie would sing his vocals in later albums like 'Hours': that rasp in the higher register. Track 8 'Untitled' is straight out of the 'Black Tie' sessions, while Track 9 'Ian Fish, UK Heir' is another moody instrumental piece similar to 'Moss Garden' and 'Subterraneans'. The album concludes with a remix of the title track.     What is appealing is that the instrumental tracks fit neatly into the album mixed with the vocal tracks, showing that Bowie was reconnecting with his experimental spirit. This was to be the key to the layers and textures of his next album, 95's 'Outside' - which contains some of his best material ever. Buddha is definately the forerunner to Outside. But its beauty is that it is one of those linking albums, like Young Americans - in this case, a halfway house between the jazz inflections and club beats of 'Black Tie, White Noise' and the dark tension and jangly piano of 'Outside'. So it fits perfectly within the Bowie canon, and now is finally recognised as such.       Buy it if you are curious, you'll be rewarded, especially if you are a Bowie fan and you like the Outside, Low and Heroes albums. If you are thinking of buying this for someone else, do so; it is accessible enough that they won't be disappointed. After all, Buddha is not a soundtrack, but a real Bowie album. And now it has finally been recognised and remastered as such.
032147404X|2.0|First of all, I really like Scott Kelby. You can read his work and laugh a lot at his jokes, and he is really an affable guy. But if you're a fledgling photographer, you should buy books by people who are known more for their photography than for Photoshop. This book shows a few good basic tips, then delves into many specialist type forms of photography. I think that if he just broke it down into components of a photograph, such as composition, exposure, light, etc, it would have been better. I am not a wedding photographer nor do I shoot portraits, so there were so many things that I skipped, I felt I would be better served by a more specific set of components which comprise any digital photograph, not specific types. Bryan Peterson's photography books are far more beneficial to me as an artist, even though Scott's attempt at defining digital photography was interesting. Nonetheless, I DID learn a better way of sharpening my photos, which was a Photoshop technique that he describes in the book. Everything else I already knew or didn't want to know. Scott has a big marketing machine machine behind him, some of whom create reviews on this site. I admire him for his skills, but this book just isn't up to par with the rest of his work. Even the layout was pretty amateurish at best.

0786838655|5.0|Ok..I love this book!  I absolutely adore this book and I am now going to say this to y'all!:  I read reviews almost every day for a lot of books.  Today I came upon this book's reviews and I see all of these reviews that people are comparing The Lightening Thief to Harry Potter.  This is ridiculous peeps!  I mean come on ya little buttknuckles!  Dont get me wrong I LOVE Harry Potter and it's one of my favorite books ever but..I mean if it's good when you're comparing HP and The Lightening Thief..then..good!  But if you're saying that The Lightening Thief is a copy of HP just because of some minor things (Half-Blood Hill..People say it's like Hogwarts..Being a Demigod is like Half blood Harry Potter..Capture the Flag..Like Quidditch..The Satyr and Annabeth like Ron and Hermoine!)  I read these and was like Wow..So you're sayin, according to the Half-Blood Hill being \\"similar\\" to Hogwarts, If ANY book would say someone went to a camp, then they're copying Harry Potter?  That's ridiculous!  Being a Demigod..Is supposedly like being a half blood so they're copying Harry Potter?   If I make a book about someone being Half-Cow would that be copying HP?  They play Capture The Flag..So in Dora the Explorer they play a game..So they're copying Harry Potter?!  No!  dont think so folks!  This is absolutely one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen!  This book is absolutely wonderful!  It's ORIGINAL..Using the Greek Gods..One of the best ideas and plots I've ever read in a book!  I highly reccomend this book to all ages!

0805079831|4.0|In \\"The Shock Doctrine\\"  Naomi Klein makes it very clear that she is no fan of Milton Friedman or the Chicago Boys free-market ideology that he espoused to Augusto Pinochet and others around the world.     Given what he have seen following the tragedy of Katrina, the disaster that is Iraq, and the history of US government and multinational intervention in Latin America, Klein's thesis is timely and prescient, especially with globalization in full swing.    Naomi Klein begins by introducing the concept of shock therapy whereby governments, dictators, and/or multinational companies take advantages of  natural disasters, terrorist attacks, imploding economies and volatile markets to pass laws and impose regulations that would not have been possible under normal circumstances. Certain politicians and corporations aim to start with a \\"clean slate\\" and rebuild a country under the free-market ideology promoted by Friedman and the Chicago Boys. Klein sets the tone for the rest of the book by introducing the reader to Dr. Ewen Cameron, the proponent of shock therapy, who believed that by using this form of treatment on his patients, he could wipe the slate clean and reconstruct their personalities from scratch. Of course, shock therapy has profound negative affects and Klein astutely relates this to what countries that have undergone economic shock therapy have experienced.     Klein proceeds to list examples of where the Chicago school of thought and shock therapy was implemented: from Chile (the military coup of Pinochet) to Bolivia (the secret privatization plan developed at the home of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada), to Argentina (the rise of the military junta in 1976), Asia (in Indonesia, where company executives promoted \\"plutonomy\\"),and Iraq, she provides solid evidence of how corporations take advantage of unfettered markets to buy up each country's resources. All along the way, Klein points out, the influence of Friedman is evident. She is very good at detailing the role of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in fomenting structural adjustment capitalism, which caused many countries, especially those in Asia and Latin America to fall further into debt and to become even more dependent on the \\"generosity\\" of multinational corporations. She even directs some criticism toward Jeffrey Sachs, currently hailed as the economist who has done the most to promote debt relief and combat poverty. How many people know that early in his career he was an economic shock therapist?    Klein makes a very compelling argument and she provides solid evidence to support her thesis. The \\"Shock Doctrine\\" will make readers think and that  is what every good book should do. After reading this book, I am now more keenly aware of the Bolivian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) and the efforts to create a Banco del Sur in South America.    I wish she would have devoted some pages to Cuba. Since the US government  follows the dictates of the right-wing Cuban exiles in Miami, it would be interesting to see what Klein thought would happen in a post-Castro Cuba.  There are undoubtedly many corporations (Starbucks, McDonalds, etc.) waiting to build their presence in this country.     I gave this book a four-star rating, not because of the content or writing style, but because of several very obvious typographical errors, such as repeating the same sentence in succession (pg. 43) and mistyping a word, \\"amentites,\\" later in the book. Perhaps the editors were overworked, but for me, when I encounter a typo, it distracts me from reading, much like a speed bump would when I drive my car.    Nevertheless, this is an excellent book that many people will be talking about for some time.
B0007IN318|4.0|Pompeii, by Richard Harris, details the destruction of Pompeii in 79 ad by long dormant Mt Vesuvius. The novel takes place over a 2 day period before the eruption as seen through the eyes of the water engineer and widower, Marcus Attilius  recently dispatched from Rome after the mysterious disappearance of his predecessor Exomnius. Something rotten is going on with the Aqua Augusta, an   important aquaduct supplying the region around the Bay of Naples. Harris introduces some historical figures like Pliny the Elder, some local movers and tycoons, assorted and sundry slaves, politicians and scoundrels as well as  the beautiful Corelia who is treated as chattel by Ampliatus, her machiavelian father. Tension builds as Vesuvio(It) rocks and rolls toward its famous blowup. Will virtue be rewarded, will the scoundrels get scalded, will true love win out in the end?        The strengths of the book include a good feel for roman society of the time, a grand and detailed depiction of the events preceding and following the eruption which I know to be pretty accurate, and a quick paced thriller which keeps the readers interest. The characters are pretty believable and most of the action sequences flow pretty well, the exception being the end of the book which is clunky and abrupt. My disclaimer is that I am recently returned from the area and our climb of Vesuvio and visits to Pompeii and Herculaneum were one of the highlights of our trip and Harris' depiction of the area is dead on. What is stunning is the dense urban landscape that once again clogs the slopes and surrounds this dangerous volcano.
B00005JPTI|4.0|The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was the concept. What if the world's population turned into zombies and, as far as you knew, you were the only man left on earth? What would you do for food? How would you handle the lack of human contact? Could it be possible that somewhere, another human walked the earth? How could you hide and protect yourself from the thousands of hostile and aggressive super-zombies that surrounded you? Would you have any hope of an existence that amounted to more than just trying to survive until the next day? In addition to a solid story, the visuals are nice, the acting is good, and the suspense is almost unbearable. Not all zombies walk. My girlfriend's hand was sore from clenching my hand throughout the movie. This movie is a nice change of pace from what you may be used to watching.

0688101364|3.0|First, the good! This book has beautiful pictures, is a lot of fun to read and drool over, and will definitely get you in a Christmassy-baking-cookies-mood! The jumbles, wreaths, toffee, and peanut butter kisses are especially delicious and will forever be in my Christmas-treat repertoire.    However, I must agree with previous reviewers who have said that some of the recipes, frankly, seem to have been done with little testing. The gingerbread refuses to come together on its own (even when the recipe is followed meticulously), and many of the recipes seem, to me, to be unnecessarily complicated. Why does one ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO use fresh coconut in the macaroons? It's a needlessly complicated step and the cookies are just as delicious (and five times faster!) with pre-packaged. Call me trailer trash, but I just don't think one should have to be a chemist to make cookies.    Also, the binding on my edition is AWFUL. The book started to fall apart after the first year. It is in many, many pieces at this point. Very disappointing, when you have to spend $20 on it!

B000TSIK14|5.0|Wow. The lads from Germany sting you once again with another awesome album full of everything you would want from a Scorpions album. Granted, they have been around for over 35 years, but it has been a little while since they've sounded this good.    Of course, everyone under the sun knows Scorpions for their classic hits like \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\", \\"No One Like You\\", and \\"Still Loving You\\", but I found Scorpions' earlier work, like 1980's Animal Magnetism, to be a basis for what rock and roll was all about in those days. Now, decades later, Scorpions return to what made them famous: the strong vocals of Klaus Meine, razor-sharp guitar licks from both Rudolph Schenker and Matthias Jabs, and an overall balance of power from all members.    The album follows a concept co-created by the album's producer Desmond Child, about a world where humans and robots are at war (sounds cheesy, but it works very well with this album!) Man is pushed to the brink of existence, and must fight to survive for all humanity. The songs focus along that central idea, with standout tracks like \\"We Will Rise Again\\", \\"The Game Of Life\\" and \\"321\\" emphasizing human survival. Other great tracks from this album include the opening track \\"Hour I\\" (which features former Marilyn Manson guitarist John 5), the powerful \\"Love Is War\\", and \\"The Cross\\", with Smashing Pumpkins vocalist Billy Corgan providing guest vocals.    The overall sound of the album caught me a little off guard, to be honest. Not that I don't like it; it's just that after hearing years and years of 80's arena rock favorites like \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" and such, I didn't expect Scorpions to adapt to the modern-day rock sound used by bands not even half their age. They did, though, and it worked very well.    It really shouldn't come as much of a surprise, though, as a few famous bands have altered their sound over the years. Rush adapted to a darker 'alternative' sound in the 90's, and it worked out fine for them. Queen ditched their synth and keyboard-flavored albums of the early/mid 80's to put down some solid rock tracks before frontman Freddie Mercury's death in 1991. But that's another story.    All I can say is this album is well worth your money (or not, if you decide to download it). Whether you're new to the band or you've followed them since Rudolph's brother Michael left the band in 1972, you will find that time has treated this band pretty well. It's easy to say taht Scorpions have maintained a steady flow of musical excellence that can never be paralleled.    Looking forward to Humanity: Hour II...whenever that happens.

0385522401|5.0|This book by McEwan is truly a masterpiece of human interaction.  His intense understanding of the physiological needs and inability to satisfy such needs is the showcase point of this short but poignant piece of fiction.    The book truly centers around the concept of sexual interaction.  In addition, the well bred Puritanism of the British mindset with respect to sex plays a crucial part in the manner in which the book progresses.  His highly introspective observation of the potential failures of people to communicate their intimacy in an appropriate manner is the true focus of his novel.    The book is characterized by disillusionment.  Both main characters fail to communicate in a meaningful way.  Would they have the maturity and talent to do so, they could perhaps have transcended the baggage of their respective upbringings.  Yet, this does not happen in this story.  A basic failure to communicate, at least meaningfully and sensitively allows destruction of a true love; which really did not have to happen.  Yet it did.    Why the repressed mores of British society produces this unholy union is not investigated.  Rather, the interactions or more accurately, the failures of meaningful interactions are the centerpiece of this novella.  McEwan shows his truly deep understanding of the modes of failed relations that are based much in the environment that put them into a situation that results in a tragedy of matrimonial distress.      Once again, McEwan shows his amazing ability to convey insight into the human condition.  While the subject matter is truly mature, the message is truly basic and important.  The book is recommended to all readers who are trying to understand how things that should not fail, can.  It is very much worth the price and the time to read.  Readers will not be disappointed in McEwan's wonderful portrayal of these two characters.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This DVD is stunning, having seen, Pink Floyd, Gilmour, and Waters live over 50 times since 1983. I have to say that this concert blew me away, and beats out being in Berlin to see Roger! In addition, the production, sound, authoring, extras and packaging are top notch! Watching David Bowie sing C Numb is worth the price alone, or maybe it's Echoes, or maybe it's Shine On. I could rattle on for a few more paragraphs, but I shall save you. Do NOT hesitate to buy this DVD.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan and I saw the movie with some serious hesitation.  While the movie wasn't perfect, the music was quite good.  The actors that are heard on this soundtrack are excellent in the way they perform these songs, making them their own while still holding respect to the songs as they were originally heard.  Not every song is a winner, but enough are to give it a recommendation.  However, this is a soundtrack that you really should give a sample listen to on the page here before you buy it, because I don't see a lot of middle ground in it.  You'll either like the changes or really hate them as they work with such well-known songs.

B000YABYLA|4.0|Admittedly, it takes about 15 minutes to get used to the wise-talking (and in this case I not only mean smart-mouthed but literally wise from intelligence) chatter of 16 year old Juno (Ellen Page, who looks like the love child of Jeannine Garafalo and Billy Cruddup) who finds herself pregnant. But whereas in most stories of this ilk, Juno is not without emotional resources: a wise, loving father and step mother (J.K. Simmons and the redoubtable Allison Janney) and a good friend...all three of whom are more than eager to offer advice. Juno attempts to have an abortion, can't do it and decides to give up her child for adoption. She scans the \\"Recycler\\" and finds a couple played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman who on several levels are less mature than Juno.<br />Director Jason Reitman (the terrific \\"Thank You for Smoking\\") and writer Diablo Cody are walking a slippery slope here: how do you make an unwed teenage mother with a smart mouth and a penchant for talking smack non-stop a la Holden Caulfield into someone who not only holds your attention but eventually steals your heart?<br />The Movies are peppered with a number of teenaged savants dating back many years with such notable examples as DeeDee (Christina Ricci in \\"The Opposite of Sex\\" to whom the moviemakers tip their hat as a precursor to Juno) and Harry Potter spouting profoundly about all manner of Life situations: in possession of learned and thoughtful opinions way, way beyond their years and life experience. Now we have Juno to add to that list.<br />\\"Juno\\" is at times very funny: not only in a ha ha sense but more importantly, cosmically and philosophically in a structured world view sense. A 16 year old without the common sense to use contraception yet intuitive and perceptive enough to wax poetically about Iggy Pop and Dario Argento? Yup: that's our Juno!
0439813786|1.0|The story I read was nicely written and the graphics artistic.  The problem was the extraordinary use of the graphics.     For example, there are 46 pages to go through before the story begins, and this only brings you to page 1 of the story.      The art of story teller is in the child's magination, not presenting it.  A graphic here and there is nice, but anything more and one needs to ask, why is this not a short film?    Some pages literally are comprised of a sentence or two before moving to the next page, formated the exact same way, then one finds another multitude of graphics.    About 10%-20% of this book is just graphics.  The story was much better written than books such as Harry Potter, but had JK followed in this author's format, her books would have been around 2100 to 2500 pages a piece.    It is disheartening to write a review like this that had great potential, but was edited and formatted in a way that detracts from the magic of stories.
0385333846|5.0|As soon as I finished this book, I wanted to read it again. And everything else by Kurt Vonnegut. For me, the mark of a good story has been one in which the reader completely forgets that he is reading text on a page, written by a person at a typewriter - i.e., total immersion in the story. At many times, this book was the polar opposite of immersion, and yet it works brilliantly. Every step of the way you feel the author's presence - particularly in his choice of words. Vonnegut uses certain descriptors repeatedly and at unexpected times, catching the reader off guard; I was both hating and loving it at the same time. I was left envious of his wit and disturbed by his purposeful callousness. The reader doesn't want it to be true that events are not preventable, that it is better simply to sit back and watch the world destroy itself.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Torchwood is the best series on American television this year !  I especially enjoyed Year One, Episode # 12 (of 13): \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\" where Jack meets the original Capt. Jack, and \\"falls\\" for him. Their mutual lonliness, need and attraction culminates in one of the most tender, warm and loving scenes ever seen on American television. This DVD is worth every penny !....

015626224X|5.0|Down and Out in Paris and London is George Orwell's first hand account of a penniless British writer in Paris and London.  His work is without pity or whining, as he tells the facts about living in both cities with little or no money.  In France he works in the hot, dirty kitchens, washing dishes.  In London he lives as a tramp, on the streets or in the free lodging houses which seem more like jails.  Wine, tea, bread and butter, he learns to live on very little, giving us the truth about being poor in society.  The needs and wants, the bugs and rats, the pride and the poverty.
B000WCBPOG|3.0|I bought this for my wife, who has been anxiously waiting for the DVD release since before we even left the theatre.  The deluxe version does contain much more music than the regular version, but I'm puzzled over the exlusion of the two tracks from most versions.  I was not aware of this before I bought it, and had I been I would have looked harder for the \\"complete\\" deluxe version.  It completely escapes me why they would do that.  The \\"I want you/she's so heavy\\" sequence was my wife's favorite part of the movie and we're both upset it is not on the CD I was so excited to give her.  I honestly can't think of a single reason why having the complete version available through only two sources, without publisizing that fact, could have benefited anyone.    Also, the description says it comes with a 16 page fold out poster that I just knew my wife would love.  It didn't.    She is still happy with the CD, and if you can't find the full version, this one is still better than the regular.  However, I personally would have done things differently if I knew then what I've learned since.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|This movie is action packed from beginning to end!  It is very well directed with many talented actors.  There is no dull moment in the entire movie.  The car chasing scene in New York City was amazing, but, in our opinion, not as spectacular as the Moscow chase scene from the 2nd Bourne movie.  The bonus feature on how the movie was made was equally entertaining.  Great dvd to add to your home movie collection.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|The first time I heard this album the hair on my neck raised, ears perked up, eyes widened.  Excellent usage of reverb, hard driven guitars dominate, with hauntingly beautiful lyrics/vocals.  Coldplay and other's can't hold a candle to this band.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|We wanted to buy this movie as soon as it came out.  It is hilarious!!  Amazon makes it easy to shop without leaving home.  You click, it comes to you.  Nice!!  This seller is very prompt and professional.
0385338902|4.0|Having loved \\"The Book of Joe\\" I held my breath waiting for his next novel, hoping that it would be as good. I am happy to report that it is, in my opinion.<br /><br />I loved the flawed characters in both books, and found this one to be a realistic portrayal of grief (and I am NOT a 25 year old male!), loss, and above all, love.<br /><br />Good job, and I especially loved the fact that this novel was linear and focused, not jumping around in time like so many contemporary novels. And I loved the way Tropper ended the book.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|this contains the original theatrical version which is a must see for anyone who enjoys sci-fi.  The original version is much better than the director's version.  This set which includes the original version alone is enough to buy it.  From looking at blockbuster and hollywood it doesn't appear they will be offering it for rent.
0743298039|5.0|This novel has all the elements to be called \\"Amazing\\".    First, we can tell the time period of Angelfield is in the late 1800's.  Second, mysteries and secrets draw someone into a world like no other.  Third, ghost stories delight a person, no matter what the age.    There are so many other parts to this novel I love, it is impossible to have them compiled into a few sentences.  It seems as though a person has different lives.      Margaret Lea has a haunting past of her twin.  Vida Winter is compelled to lie.  The Angelfield Twins are crazy.  Melancholy affects many.

0143038583|5.0|This fascinating and exceptionally well written book provides an easy to follow, yet highly educational overview of agribusiness and multiple related topics.<br /><br />It starts with the idea of the Omnivore's Dilemma: if you can eat almost anything, what should you eat?<br /><br />From there it describes how corn and soybeans have become dominant, how modern farms work, the multiple problems created by the standard industrial food chain, and how the organic food movement tries (but mostly fails) to do better.<br /><br />Along the way we see:<br />* The extreme cruelty and suffering that is inflicted on farm animals (its far worse than you think it is).<br />* The environmental and health problems created by our industrial food chain.<br />* The organic food movement explored and some of its frauds and deceits exposed.<br />* The moral issues involved in eating flesh.<br /><br />Presented as a fascinating and easy to follow journey, this book contains a wealth of information and deep insight.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000WC3864|2.0|I like this movie as much as any fan, but come on--how many times are we going to have to buy this before we have the absolute final edition? I don't believe that there is anything included here that couldn't have been put with any of the previous ones. And so I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those of a cynical perspective (I don't like to be cynical...) and give this movie two stars. Great movie, but it's the same in all editions! The film itself is the core of the product, so why do I have to spend over $30 to buy it ONCE AGAIN? I realize that it's unreasonable to expect them to accomodate those of us who have bought it several times, but we are the true fans and I feel some sort of loyalty is due in our favor. I also realize that, of course, this is good business on the part of the studio... but in the long run one could spend several hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands... buying multiple editions of many 'collectible' movies over time. How can I justify buying the same movie in the same medium (I understand converting from vhs to dvd of course) when that money could be spent on a different film or some invaluable outdoor activity, or... crazy notion... giving the money to charity? $30 can feed a whole family for more than a month in some countries. Just a thought.     On an added (somewhat unrelated) note--I don't like to include references to other reviews in my own (waste of time and wholly irrelevant) but why do some people attack the negative reviews of others? We are all entitled to our personal opinions of a product as a whole, and we ought review it as such. I like this movie alot, but based on my reasons given above I would rate this edition two stars. As a slightly more diplomatic reviewer, I might give the product AS A WHOLE, four stars, for those who haven't yet 'taken the plunge'. The reasoning behind four stars and not five is that even with all the extras, close to $30 dollars is still overly expensive (collector's items?! These aren'tPicassos and Stradivari we're talking about here... they're plastic and cardboard!)     Now, if you don't like my review--too bad. Deal with it. But if you don't find it HELPFUL, then you can click \\"no\\" towards the end. Alternatively, you can click \\"yes\\". It's easy when you know how, eh?

B00005NB8K|1.0|I will say the only good thing I have to say about this waste of celluloid right up front. I enjoyed Val Kilmer's performance as Jim Morrison. He did the best job he could with the woeful script he was given. If only we could have had the same performance in a better film.    This film is awful on so many levels. Its characterisations are not true to the known descriptions of the people it portrays, most of whom were still living at the time the film was released. The only excuse for that kind of sloppiness is that Oliver Stone wanted to portray Jim Morrison, his friends, his band, his lovers, and the era in which he lived in Stone's own way, regardless of the facts.    Yes, I was not there, I did not know Jim Morison at the time, nay, I was not even born. But I have read his printed works, seen his films, and listened to his music. As a musician, author, poet and songwriter, myself, I know that one can tell much about an artist from his work. Whether or not No One Here Gets out Alive, or Break On Through, or Ray Manzarek and John Densmore's memoirs give a more accurate picture of Jim Morrison's life and death is not at issue here, nor is my generational status.     The Jim Morrison portrayed by this film is not the artist I, or any other fan, or fellow musician or writer know from the man's body of work. As such, Oliver Stone's film is an insult to the late Mr. Morrison both as an artist and a man.     Oliver Stone's \\"The Doors\\" is cheap, tawdry, badly written, poorly made and, with the exception of Mr. Kilmer's performance, badly acted. Even if you are not a fan of the Doors you should avoid this film at all costs; if for no other reason than out of simple respect for the dead, who as Mr. Stone well knows, cannot be libeled or slandered and no longer have the ability to speak in their own defence.    If you are a fan of the Doors and of Jim Morrison I must urge you even more strongly to avoid this film. It will outrage and infuriate you, but, worse, it will saddenyou deeply to see the dreadful spectacle of a lesser artist's attempt to usurp the vision of a greater one by standing on his shoulders.    Or, in Oliver Stone's case, on Jim Morrison's tombstone.
B000WGZGNS|3.0|While I enjoyed most of this DVD, I found parts of it to be annoying. Beyonce can put on a show but she left the stage way too much to change and the band played songs that are Beyonce or Destiny's Child related as she changed. When I see a DVD Entitled \\"The Beyoncé Experience - Live\\", I expect the music to be all Beyoncé material. When her bad started playing [[ASIN:B00005IA6V So Fresh, So Clean]], [[ASIN:B000CNEQ9G Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]], And with Beyoncé mixing [[ASIN:B000F2C7L8 Crazy]]'s lyrics in with [[ASIN:B00009VGGT Crazy in Love]] it threw me away from \\"The Beyoncé Experience\\" I am supposed to be getting from the dvd. The interpertations weren't bad it just wasn't Beyoncé. Other than that, The DVD is pretty good

B000HIVIOW|5.0|So, I'm not good on words and writing reviews, but here are my two cents (and here goes nothing, lol)... I loved this movie as a child.  I never knew the name of this movie (or maybe I did, when I was a child, but just forgot) and recently it came into my mind a few weeks ago.  I did a search on it on Yahoo! Search and came upon \\"The Snowman.\\"  When I saw a graphic/ image, I knew that this was it-- this was the movie I loved so much as a kid.  I wanted to purchase it right away, so I did-- first by going online and looking it up on eBay.  I was bidding up to $25+ on this movie.  I did not end up winning the item.  Someone notified me on eBay (an eBay member) and told me that \\"The Snowman\\" was on sale for $4.99 (I believe) on Amazon-- on your site!  I was like, \\"What?!  $4.99?!  No way!\\"  I had to check it out right away, so I did and to my surprise, she was right!  I ended up buying this DVD, right here, on Amazon and saving up to $20! I am VERY happy!  I am all ready in love with Amazon and that is NO joke, since I just made my first purchase (on this site), here recently.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|This Cenerentola have everything to be the perfect recipe: La Scala, Claudio Abbado conducting, Jean Pierre Ponelle directing (vero factotum), a glorious cast, and the superb music of the master of opera buffa, Gioacchino Rossini. Who could ask for anything more?<br />Truly a landmark among filmed operas, this production is a must not only for opera lovers, but also for everyone who wants to begin to know and love the genre.<br />The cast, flawless: Frederica von Stade, marvelous voice and beautiful presence; the buffo trio of Paolo Montarsolo (the best of the group), Margherita Guglielmi and Laura Zannini; the funny impersonation of Claudio Desideri; the fresh performance of Francisco Araiza, and the secure Paul Plishka as the supportive Alidoro.<br />Scene after scene, this is first class opera: look at the \\"shadow-theatre\\" ensemble at second act and you will be convinced of the genius of Ponnelle.<br />In front of La Scala orchestra Abbado remains what he is, one of the leading italian conductors of all times.<br />There is no way to be disappointed with this DVD.

Overall quality less than usual for Costco....but looks really cool nontheless!
6305311463|5.0|First of all I was hoping to get more reviews on why I should or shouldn't buy this edition of Armageddon (why I should spend $35 or $10), but most of these reviews were about the movie and not the video itself (sounds more like I am rating the reviews, huh?) I will probably purchase this edition and then I will post another (or update this) review so those of us who have seen the movie, and love Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi and Ben Affleck (and all the others) and just love the movie can make a decision on which edition is most worth the money. PS If anyone out there has a review of this edition itself, please let us know, thanks to those who have.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This is one of the best action movies i have seen in a long time. You will NOT be dissapointed with this. Since I didn't see one or two it was kind of confusing at first, but the more you got into it the more you understand. A MUST buy!!!! I wish they would sell this to go with the playstation 3 instead of that crapy spiderman 3!!!!
0205313426|5.0|The problem with my generation is that we all want to throw off the standards that have guided the creation of art in favor of individual expression. While individual expression is wonderful, it must be presented in a manner that has some objective parameters; we can't expect others to intuitively understand what goes on in our mind, we must find a way transfer what goes on there into the minds of others, and standards are necessary for this.<br /><br />That said, this is a wonderful reference for issues of style in written expression. The guidelines are intuitive; they are what we would hope for from other writers, and therefore what we should strive for in our own writing. The book is easy to reference, concise, and should help almost anyone become a better writer as a result of using it and employing its guidelines. Recommended to anyone that writes often, especially those who write research work in the fields of art and humanities.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Penélope Cruz is outstanding in this film; her co-stars are all first rate as well.  Carmen Maura is a wonderful actress who works so well with Cruz.      There are lots of surprises along the way.  There are many funny moments as well as intensely dramatic scenes.  All are very well acted.  Penélope sings the tango \\"Volver\\" in the style of a Spanish \\"copla\\" with guitar accompaniment; it is truly wonderful.    This is a film that I will watch again and again.  ¡VOLVER!

0765357151|5.0|I am incredibly astonished that they put the \\"I Am Legend\\" movie poster on the cover of Richard Matheston's own \\"I Am Legend\\" novel.  Anyone that has seen the movie AND read the book should be equally insulted. The novel has a wonderful dark and haunting  atmosphere, which by the way is NOT set in New York City!  Robert Neville is a brooding alcoholic layman who AFTER the \\"plague\\" has to teach himself science and virology between periods of drunken depression, he is NOT a colonel and brilliant scientist with a loving companion German Shepard.<br />I loved the entire book but to me the greatest part and what separates \\"I Am Legend\\" from other typical horror/vampire/apocalyptic stories is the ending. That being said, the current movie that critics are hailing as the closest rendering of the novel yet (it has been remade 2x prior) is an insult to the post-apocalyptic vision Richard Matheson created.  The demise of our beloved hopeless and inverted hero as Matheson wrote it is COMPLETELY lost in the film which disappointingly ends with hope for the future of mankind.<br />Buy an another edition that is not related to the movie and enjoy.
1434605000|2.0|but I have read a few books. The one I read before I bought this one was Steppenwolf, also by Hess. Both are excellent novels, in my opinion. What I didn't like was not the way Siddhartha was written but the way this particular book was interpreted and printed. There are several places in the text where mistakes were made it seemed to me, in word selection in the interpretation. The mistakes are not such that the meaning of the text is changed. But they are words of the wrong tone. For example: \\"Bliss leapt in his mother's breast... \\"(from the first page), might have been better as \\"Bliss leapt in his mother's bosom.\\"  There are other places in the text where this happens.<br /><br />Plus there are many typos. Page 108 has some text in brackets that looks like a proofreaders note that some how got put into the printing of the book.<br /><br />This is a good novel but buy a version other than this one from Bibliobazarr.
0385522401|4.0|Only Ian McEwan knows.    The interesting and touching interplay between Florence and Edward in my opinion is an allegory.    They are, as most of us, products of their personal history as it parallels global history.      Without repeating the plot as most have already done, Florence and Edward represent two individuals on the cusp of monumental social changes in western society.  Why would Ian McEwan use so many historical references to ground the romantic plot between 2 persons.      Rock and Roll impetuousness meets classical music discipline;  Edward meets Florence.  The 1950's slam into the frivolous 1960's.    Think about it.  What survives?  Florence flourishes while Edward stumbles constantly seeking something new to enrich him.  In addition he longs for what he had in Florence.  Sure, she, as indicated in a parenthetical reference, scans the audience and her eyes rest for a moment on seat 9C, but, aptly, that is only a small aside as a diversion  well planed by McEwan to solidify the  disparity between the two and reinforce the major historical theme.    Florence was chaste as repeatedly drummed into us by McEwan.  So were the 1950's.  The extemity of her chastity culminating in her repulsiveness toward all aspects of a sexual union is difficult to believe. Was it an incestual encounter as hinted, or is it there for emphasis to have us see this clash of \\"eras\\" clearly!!    McEwan's strength is his writing style.  It flows; each of his books is appealing as a psychological analysis of characters framed by their reaction to the socio/political environment.    Ian McEwan does prompt thought about deeper thematic underpinnings.  That's good for book club discussions for sure.
0143038419|5.0|A brilliant book. Written in such a  beautiful way i often had to read the page twice just to read the words again. A real thought provoking, soul searching book that makes you feel good every time you pick it up.
B000OZ2CXE|5.0|I own the Death Proof Soundtrack on both CD and this Vinyl LP. I thought it would be great to get the Vinyl LP because of the old Grindhouse scene they were trying to accomplish with the movies. It is a real tasteful and recommended piece. It comes with some nice larger photos and the vinyl itself is a blood stain-type pattern on a black background, making the LP look really cool. The sound quality is fine too, if you take care of it. It may not be as portable as a CD but I am glad I purchased this gem. Thanks.
B0000041Z5|1.0|What is it about Brahms's orchestra music that makes it a favorite of mine?  The melancholy, the autumnal sound, the lovely sadness, particularly of the 2nd movements.  Brahms is  not just another Beethoven.  Some orchestras and conductors just don't get it.  My favorites are Toscanini, Furtwangler, Munch, Walter, Karajan, to mention just a few.  This same lovely sound is also available to you by way of the Clarinette Quintet with Oppenheim and the Budapest, the Alto Rhapsody, the German Folk Songs with the Roger Wagner Chorale, the Song of Destiny.  Just one music nut's opinion.  50svinyl
B00005JPTI|5.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable...and manmade. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City...and maybe the world. But he is not alone. He is surrounded by \\"the Infected\\" -- victims of the plague who have mutated into carnivorous beings who can only exist in the dark and who will devour or infect anyone or anything in their path. For three years, Neville has spent his days scavenging for food and supplies and faithfully sending out radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. All the while, the Infected lurk in the shadows, watching Neville's every move, waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But his blood is also what The Infected hunt, and Neville knows he is outnumbered and quickly running out of time. The cast led by Will Smith (as Robert Neville) is excellent! The directing by Francis Lawrence (who also directed \\"Constantine\\" (2005) is great! The screenplay, (which is based on the novel by Richard Matheson, and the 1971 screenplay of \\"The Omega Man\\" by John William Corrington & Joyce Corrington) by Mark Protosevich (who also wrote the screenplay to \\"Poseidon\\" (2006) and the story and screenplay to \\"The Cell\\" (2000) & Akiva Goldsman (who also wrote the screenplay to \\"I, Robot\\" (2004) and the upcoming \\"Hancock\\" (2008), both which also starred or stars Smith), he also produced \\"Constantine\\", \\"Poseidon\\", & the upcoming \\"Hancock\\") is excellent! The music by James Newton Howard (who also did the music to \\"King Kong\\" (2005), \\"Michael Clayton\\" (2007), \\"The Lookout\\" (2007) and the upcoming \\"Charlie Wilson's War\\" (2007) & \\"The Great Debaters\\" (2007), he also is doing the music to the upcoming \\"The Happening\\" (2008) & \\"The Dark Knight\\" (2008) is excellent! The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie (who also did the cinematography to the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" (2001, 2002, & 2003) trilogy & \\"King Kong\\", he also did the cinematography to the upcoming \\"The Lovely Bones\\" (2009) is excellent! The film editing by Wayne Wahrman (who also did the film editing to \\"Constantine\\") is great! The casting by Kathleen Chopin (who also did the casting to \\"Hitch\\" (2005), which also starred Smith) is excellent! The production design by Naomi Shohan (who also did the production design to \\"Constantine\\" and the upcoming \\"The Lovely Bones\\") & David Lazan (who also  an art director for \\"Constantine\\") is excellent! The art direction by William Ladd Skinner (who also did the art direction to \\"Mr. Brooks\\" (2007), \\"Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End\\" (2007), & \\"Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\\" (2006) & Patricia Woodbridge (who also did the art direction to \\"Hitch\\") is excellent! The set decoration by George DeTitta Jr. (who also did the set decoration to \\"Michael Clayton\\" & \\"Enchanted\\" (2007), he also did the set decoration to the upcoming \\"The Lovely Bones\\") is excellent! The costume design by Michael Kaplan (who also did the costume design to the upcoming \\"Star Trek\\" (2008) is great! This is an great sci-fi horror-thriller that keeps your heart pounding and your mind thinking. This is one of the better Will Smith action-type movies in recent history.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|Watched this DVD four times because the cast of actors and actresses were outstanding, a good fit!  And, the music was engaging... and I am a Beatle fan!  I even bought the soundtrack!  Hugh Grant is a solid performer in romantic comedies.
0823016714|4.0|Simply put - if you are an artist and in need of finding a facial expression, this is the book for you. In this book's voluminous pages, you can find nearly any facial expression that you'd care to depict, from joy to rage to pain to sadness and back again. Marc Simon has put together a fantastic reference for the artist here.    The book includes many, many models of all ages, ethnicities and genders. Each model gets a 3-page (or so) section of the book, and each pages includes 16 photographs of them in various expressions from various angles (largely side view or straight-on). The photographs are all in black and white. Concluding each model's 3-page section is a page or two of how artists have used their expressions in their own work; this may sound kind of silly, but it is really interesting to see how artists have used this book to good effect. The book also has sections on kissing, on models wearing hats, on expression progressions, and even on how certain sounds look when they are formed with the mouth (I suspect that this is specifically aimed at animators).    The only complaint I have with this book is that it is largely unorganized. While it is broken down by model and age, what would have been more helpful, I think, would be if it had been broken down by expression - oftentimes the same expression is repeated with each model (in variations) and it would have been easier to find the right expression and the right face in this schema. As it is now, you have to hunt for the right expression, often through many pages. This keeps me from awarding this book my full 5 stars.    However, despite this small failing, this book is probably the ultimate facial expression reference. You'd do well to add it to your reference library.
B000PC8AFU|4.0|...about this album are the fickle complaints that this somehow 'pillages' the legacy of SRV (whaaa...?) or that it's only the record label trying to make some cash. (Again - whaaa....?)    Gues what - don't wanna hear it? Don't %$#! buy it. If you really have to ask whether this disc was \\"necessary,\\" you probably shouldn't have spend the cash on it in the first place, and quite honestly, you're probably a total snob. :(    Guess what else - every label in history that has ever printed music albums has done so only for the purpose of making cash. The record industry only put this together to make money? Sure. The same could be said about Texas Flood or In Step. This is, afterall, a free-market economy.    Don't like the album? Get over yourselves and put it away or don't buy it in the first place. If these songs are so openly available on (illegal) bootlegs, then why did you even buy this disc?    And on that note, just what do you think Stevie Ray would have thought about his 'fans' buying his music on (illegal) pirate-profiteer bootlegs instead of published, official releases? Tisk tisk...    These songs are Stevie's songs...they are decent quality recordings...they were released on CD...yup, everything seems to make sense to me.    Four Stars.
B0009SS00A|1.0|besides the obvious and wooden dialog and \\"puzzles\\" he gets his \\"end of book, 10 seconds to go\\" solution factually, in a big way, wrong.  The fat man Nagasaki bomb was plutonium, it wasn't enriched uranium, Brown's little solution is a non-starter, he comes out looking really amateurish.  How can people think this guy is a good writer, the Da Vinci code suffered from similar problems, whats going on here, aren't there any standards anymore?
B0006VYG62|5.0|To be honest, if there's one thing that I didn't understand in this book, it's the title.<br /><br />The rest just made perfect sense.<br /><br />Plath is clearly a poet of some kind. Her writing flows beautifully and lyrically. It has the smooth edge only a poet can achieve in fiction. This is both a positive thing and a negative one. While it makes aspects incredibly well written, it also makes the book a tad bit over-indulgent.<br /><br />Or, it would, if there wasn't the whole story around it. Without having known Plath's background story when I picked this up, I knew instantly that this was real. Perhaps the name was changed and some things tweaked, but this just breathed so perfectly. I knew that this was honest, open, and true, and the whole world of Sylvia Plath/Esther Greenwood sucked me in.<br /><br />It went beyond the nice writing. It went into the emotions. I couldn't tear myself away from the book. It made me think, it made me wonder, and it (most of all) made me feel. At times I was disgusted, at times I was amazed, at times I was crying - but I was there all along. It's a vivid, clear account of depression, and a world that is practically unknown.<br /><br />What's for sure is that this will stay with me for years to come, both in my mind and in my heart. It makes one appreciate life without depression, teaches a lot, and is an overall incredible, breath-taking ride.<br /><br />A necessity.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I didn't expect Daniel Craig to be a good Bond. I was so wrong. He was the best I've seen. This film is    - fast,  - well-written,  - cast very well, and  - classy.    What I really liked about this film over many other Bond film is that gadgetry and the traditional 'spy stuff' was left out of it (this seems over done in most films). It didn't make a mockery of itself like some other Bond and spy films. Bond's promiscuity was evident but Craig carried these scenes with some integrity... typically these scenes seem forced into movies... they weren't (as) forced in this movie. [This is the only Bond film I have cared enough to buy.]
B0002F6BRE|4.0|I discovered \\"Elf\\" last Christmas. It's a sweet and funny story of an orphan who was adopted by one of Santa's elves. Will Ferrel is great as the 6 foot elf. I recommend it if you love Christmas movies and are tired of the same old ones year after year.
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert bares her soul in this moving memoir. I found her search for personal truth relatable even though it took her far from anywhere I've ever been in the world. Her story made me laugh out loud, cry and think about my own life in ways that I had not thought before. Ms. Gilbert's way of moving between the serious and the hilarious made tough subjects easier to handle and made her book an extremely enjoyable read. I recommend this book to anyone, but particularly to people searching for themselves because I think they will find this memoir to be a great help and inspiration.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|One of the big arcs of the \\"Stargate SG-1\\" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis.<br /><br />It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually), known as \\"Stargate: Atlantis.\\" The first season has its duds and awkward moments -- much like its parent series -- but it proves to be a solid introduction to likable new heroes, a legendary city, and a new race of alien parasites.<br /><br />At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gives the go-ahead for an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis -- even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.<br /><br />So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. Unfortunately, after ten millennia Atlantis is running out of power, and soon the whole place will flood. The military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), goes scouting for a planet to evacuate to, and encounter the friendly natives.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the irritable scientist Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) tries to somehow salvage the city -- only to have it rise from the ocean floor. But then the SG teams accidentally wake an ancient enemy -- the parasitic, vampiric Wraith, who destroyed the Ancients long ago. Cut off from Earth, the expedition settles into the Ancient city and tries to make the best of their situation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- an energy-sucking \\"shadow,\\" possible spies, life-sucking bugs, a destructive nanovirus, a mysterious goddess, suicidal kids, cannibal Wraith, and an Amishlike people who turn out to be ruthless soldiers. And the Wraith are closing in on Atlantis, intent on getting to Earth -- forcing Weir and Sheppard to arm the city for what may be its final stand.<br /><br />\\"Stargate: Atlantis\\" has an easier introduction than most series, even spinoffs. The whole idea was introduced over a few seasons of \\"Stargate SG-1,\\" and two of the characters (Weir and McKay) were also recurring characters. And thank God, there is no endless whining about how they may never see Earth again, as many series would do -- the Atlantis personnel just forge ahead, and deal with it.<br /><br />It does have some flaws, mostly the same ones that \\"SG-1\\" had in ITS first season --  a few duds (\\"The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you\\"), and many others that are good sci-fi watchin', but not great. It takes a little time for the series to get comfortable, but by the last four or five episodes, it really takes off.<br /><br />And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror. But it doesn't lose its laid-back style (Rodney massaging his feet during a conference), or its human side -- for example, one episode has everyone recording touching messages to send back to Earth.<br /><br />And the dialogue is pretty great, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges. Most are from Rodney (\\"This device must be using an older version of Windows\\"), and Sheppard (\\"I am your death. That is all you need to know.\\" \\"I prefer 'Steve'\\"). But there's humor from everyone (\\"Find another problem with it! Tell him that the power-loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout!\\").<br /><br />The cast is a bit uneven -- Higginson is given too little to do, and Rainbow Sun Francks just never works. But Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian sarcastic snap, Hewlett is hilarious as the mildly antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, and Paul McGillion is simply adorable as a cuddly Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell starts off as just the token native love interest, she evolves nicely at the end of the season.<br /><br />\\"Stargate Atlantis\\" has its shaky moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles. But it's a solid first for a solid sci-fi series, gating out into a new galaxy.moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles.

B00005JPTI|4.0|Had I seen this movie without reading the book I would put it on my top ten list of favorite movies.  However, the way the movie was adapted was so far from the source material the only recognizable aspect was the basic premise and the name of the main character.  That being said, the movie was very entertaining and was not at all a waste of my money.  I think anyone who likes the action/horror genre would appreciate this, but if you have read the book, go into the theater with an open mind, forget about the source material, and just enjoy yourself.
0143036556|3.0|Jared Diamond proposed an interesting, environment-centered view of history is his dense but enriching Guns, Germs and Steel. Now he is proposing an interesting, environment-centered view of the future in Collapse. In so doing he sounds an alarm for potential environmental disasters that he sees as imminent.     Collapse is split into two sections: the first deals with ancient societies, such as those on Pacific islands, Greenland and the Mayas in the Americas that collapsed in a chain reaction of environmental degradation that led to starvation, wars and extinction. Here Diamond does what he does best: recounts in minute detail the plants, animals, natural resources and others on which these societies depended and which they failed to maintain. His example of Easter Island, whose natives managed to cut down every last tree and turn it into a barren wasteland, is particularly striking.     The second section deals with modern societies which are also facing environmental strain. Diamond has chosen five: the US state of Montana, which he knows very well and with which he starts off the book; Rwanda, whose overpopulation he cites as one of the causes of its 1994 genocide; Haiti, that shares an island with the Dominican Republic but is much poorer; China, whose growth has put a strain on its resources as well as those of the rest of the world; and Australia, whose European colonists were used to more hospitable terrain. The choices are interesting: while nobody will deny that Rwanda and Haiti are among the most wretched places on Earth, China and Australia are hardly anybody's idea of societies in decline, and most Chinese are gladly trading in their former poverty for a nice big gulp of Beijing's smog-laden air. Though Montana may have its problems, it's hardly Hades.     Diamond is an expert anthropologist, and the level of detail he brings to his retelling can be daunting, but nobody can accuse him of not knowing his subject. He loses his way when he leaves anthropology to dive into politics and statistics: claiming that China's air pollution costs it 54 billion dollars of health-care costs a year (at the time of the book, that was approximately the total of all health care spending in China), that Australia can only \\"sustainably\\" support 8 million people, or that a \\"conservative\\" estimate of the number of annual deaths caused by air pollution in the United States is 130,000 (the WHO puts it at 41,200 for 2002). A further problem is that Diamond gives no sources for his claims, leaving it up to the reader to wonder if he just quoted alarmists of made up the numbers himself.     Despite all this, Collapse brings important attention to the damage humanity is causing to its environment, damage which is often far more expensive and painful to undo than to prevent in the first place. Also, much of this damage (deforestation, toxic pollutants, overfishing, climate change, etc) takes place over decades and sometimes centuries, so by the time we realize that we have a problem it may be too late. I don't share Diamond's alarmist tone, but I don't believe either that we can simply keep ignoring our environmental impact on the Earth. This book should be read with a grain of salt, but it should be read.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I have followed Nightwish from the very beginning and watched them progress from a small-time group to the world-acclaimed band they have become. I must say that during the later years it felt like the former singer Tarja didn't seem to have her heart in the music as much as the other artists did and that was a true shame because they started as a really great group. Now that Tarja is out of the picture it is like listening to a whole new style for the group. I gotta say their music is absolutely awesome on this album! Perhaps getting rid of Tarja was the catalyst for their edgy new sound, perhaps thats what they were destined for all along. But this album is edgy, filled with good lyrics, has some awesome instrumental work, and above all features music with some heart to it. This album is AWESOME!!!
B00003CXC7|4.0|When Alfred Hitchcock offered the lead role in this film to Jimmy Stewart in 1954, Stewart was reluctant:\\"Gee, that didn't seem like much of a part. But, Hitch could do that..create a good film out of next to nothing.\\" So, Hitchcock paired Stewart with Grace Kelly (old enough to be his daughter) and came up with a gem. which seems to have faded a bit with time. Laid up with a broken leg, Stewart all but rejects his girlfriend, Kelly, preferring to snoop on the neighbors with a pair of binoculars. Just imagine a Matt Damon or a Leo DiCaprio pulling a stunt like this today with a Kate Winslet type, Anyway, Stewart\\"s  reconnaissance missions eventually turn up what he's convinced is a wife murderer; the type that likes to dismember his victim. But our voyeur is having the darndest time convincing police officer Corey until... This is still a very good movie, well worth your time. But time does change one's perspective, especially after 53 years.
B00005JPTI|4.0|In just a couple of years, cancer will be cured via a mutated version of the measles virus...reprogrammed to destroy cancer. Yet just three years after that, mankind will be all but extinct, as the virus has mutated yet again to where it either kills the person carrying it or turns that person into a type of light-fearing zombie set on eating living flesh of any kind. In Manhattan, the lone \\"normal\\" survivor is Dr. Robert Neville, who coincidentally was the military scientist who was madly working on a cure as all of society crumbled around him. He continues to work on a cure...even when it seems there might not be any reason one is needed. Accompanied only by his faithful canine companion Sam, he roams the streets of NYC, hunting for deer, gathering supplies, renting DVDs and sending out an AM signal encouraging others to come to him. Oh, and occasionally ensnaring a zombie so that he can take it back to his lab to try his latest serum on it.     That's the premise in a nutshell. You might be picking up on just a little cynicism in my description, because the movie invites it. It throws out a few tidbits about exactly what has happened to mankind and the virus (and also to many other species), yet the puzzle pieces we pick up don't quite make a full puzzle and sometimes the pieces don't seem to be to the same puzzle.     Many, many movie have been made about the last remnants of mankind. A good recent example is the powerful CHILDREN OF MEN. We have a society that has apparently lost the ability to produce offspring. That's all we are told...no other details about how this has happened. It just has...and we see the consequences on society and on the very soul of mankind. If the movie had let little details trickle out...we would have tried to piece them together and no doubt we would have been left frustrated. Instead, we just have to accept it, and go where the movie takes us.     I AM LEGEND throws out some tidbits and we try to assemble them into a cohesive narrative. But it can't be done. When the film was over, we spent our time trying to make sense of the little bits, instead of talking about the grand scheme of things...the movie itself.     And there IS much to admire in the movie. Honestly, I have never seen CGI used more effectively to create a city. In Peter Jackson's KING KONG, he used CGI to recreate a Great Depression-era NYC. It was beautiful and convincing...but the abandoned Manhattan that we see in I AM LEGEND is even more seamless. You almost never can tell where a real set blends with a computer generated one. The city is empty, the bridges are destroyed, weeds grow everywhere and deer run everywhere. It's actually a pretty startling accomplishment, and seeing Will Smith driving all through these streets that should be jammed with people, traffic, lights, energy but instead are like a metropolitan dust bowl is pretty scary. And the effects are really convincing. Even the CG deer (and the lions who appear, no doubt having escaped from the Central Park Zoo) look amazingly convincing.     And Will Smith gives a committed performance. He's not a great actor, but he is a charismatic presence...which in a film like this, where he's the ONLY person on screen for huge chunks of time, is even more important. We have to see the world almost entirely through his eyes, and Smith does an outstanding job in showing us the loneliness he feels all the time and the insanity that is lurking just around the corner. Smith is aided in his work by Sam, a wonderful German Shepherd. Sam is not one of these dogs who has been trained to cock his head to the side all the time and look like he understands every word being spoken. He's not \\"cute.\\" He looks like a dog you or I could own...smart, but also still just a dog. He is loyal to a fault, but also inadvertently nearly gets his master killed in an amazingly tense scene in a dark warehouse where we first encounter the zombies. So I guess I'm saying Sam gives a naturalistic performance! Kudos to his trainers, and even to Smith, who works with Sam like a man who owns a DOG and not some unnaturally sensitive creature.     There are some exciting scenes, no doubt. And as we would expect, the film has a huge final confrontation between Smith and a marauding horde of zombies. In many ways, it's a good scene...lots of noise, close calls, explosions and so forth. But sadly, where the CG that created NYC is nearly perfect, the filmmakers chose to make the zombies CG creations as well, and not for one moment do these creatures look physical. They are obvious CG creations...and that saps so much drama from the film. And I have to wonder WHY they did it? Certainly there are amazing things that can be done with makeup...and real people could have done a most of the things the zombies do. It was a serious blunder, in my opinion.     I won't tell you any more of the plot, but suffice it to say that at the end, just a few too many \\"oh, isn't that convenient\\" moments pop up...and our willingness to suspend disbelief crumbles a bit. I would say that the first hour or so are really excellent, gripping, convincing and well-acted. The final 25 minutes or so are contrived and a bit awkward. It's like someone letting out the air from a very nice balloon.     It's still a movie worth seeing. It's brisk enough to show you a good time...but when I left, my first thought was that the film could have been so much more. And then my mind turned to puzzling out all the inconsistencies in the back story. Don't let yourself be sucked in by those, and maybe you'll enjoy it more!!  3.5 stars.
B00005JPTI|4.0|I Am Legend is one of the films I greatly anticipated for Winter 2007 and having just emerged from the theater I feel as though a great deal is needed.  Perhaps my hopes were just too high but let's look at this point by point.<br /><br />I Am Legend is roughly take 6 at the original novel of the same name.  The Omega Man is probably the most popular and, for fans of that movie and older generations, this will prove very disappointing as both films derive multiple themes from the book such as Sam the dog, a woman entering Neville's life, etc, etc.  \\"IAL\\" just was not unique enough to satisfy certain fans.  For the general audience, however, there are some redeeming qualities.<br /><br />The visual were very nice.  New York city was reproduced superbly if not used outright as several blocks were closed off for the filming; kudos.  The \\"monsters\\" were kind of freaky but I almost felt a humanistic touch to them as one seemed to express remorse for losing one of his kind (I thought she was his daughter or something) but it's not expanded on.<br /><br />The acting, which comprises almost solely on Will Smith, is superb.  I still am having trouble finding a movie Will Smith acted poorly in every movie he is in I think about seeing just on that basis.  He performs well as a man living almost entirely alone for several years but remains diligent in his tasks.<br /><br />The story had potential.  It deviated slightly from the book in terms of the ending but I think almost for the better.  I'm glad the directors took a different approach to the Twilight Zone-esque themes of vampires that the original book took.  DESPITE ALL THIS, the movie was TOO SHORT.  It was barely 90 minutes (I think) and sooo much more could've been explained, expanded upon or even made somewhat kewl.  The ending came too quick and very anti-climatic almost to the bewilderment of the audience.  They didn't even bother to explain how certain things came to be and that really bothered me.<br /><br />The story is similar to War of the Worlds only the movie didn't suck as much; too many holes, not enough time.  IAL could've easily been an epic but directors settled for a 90-minute money bagger and I'm quite disappointed.  The movie started out awesome but just fell short at the end.<br /><br />I will still buy this on DVD when it comes out but for theater goers I must give a warning that there are holes.  Also, THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM.  Several people tried to ward me off due to \\"horror-elements.\\"  This is not the case.  If anything, it is a thriller.  It is appropriate for most audiences although I wouldn't bring too young of kids.<br /><br />All in all, a B-.  Diss marks for lack of story and length.  It kills the movie.ds only the movie didn't suck as much; too many holes, not enough time.

B000000993|4.0|I miss this sound. These were the scariest punk rockers around at the time. Maynerd Keenan meant every word of what he said, and the lyrics are still more visceral than most anything you'll hear on the radio today. Adam Jones' guitars were scary, strange, and felt like the groan of human body parts. This whole album sounded like the bottom of a soul being scraped; we need more of it.

B00082ZS5W|5.0|Just watched this Dido Video again the other night and the excellent stereo surround sound of Dido's ethereal voice is spellbinding.   Simple, elegant and talented.  Saw her in concert at Jones Beach, on Long Island, a couple of years ago and was amazed at her ability to transfix an audience with her amazing talent.  Finally a video and audio disk to enjoy her wonderful songs whenever the mood hits.  A real \\"keeper\\" for my DVD archive.  Hope another album comes out soon...
0393327345|5.0|I ordered this book with a few other books and got the free super saver shipping. I ordered the books on Sunday and received them by Thursday. This was a great book, and I would recommend it. The movie is great too. If you've already seen the movie and enjoyed it the book will give you a new perspective and you'll probably enjoy the book as much, if not more than, the movie.

B000R7I3LY|4.0|It's been years since I've boughten an album that has the \\"long lasting\\" quality that this album does.  I can't seem to get enough of it from my IPOD.  I play it constantly and I can honestly say that in recent years it's been harder to find albums and artists like this who seem to create every song with just the right amount of \\"play over and over quality.\\"  What you have here is a singer/songwriter that has been carefully constructed over several years with just the right amount of blends and balances that make a perfect pop record.  Great songwriter + great producer = great album.  It's really that simple.  One thing to keep in mind though is; this is technically a \\"first\\" album for her since no one really took notice of her until now.  I only hope she isn't destroyed by over saturation and fandom like so many artists are, once they have a breakthrough single that is played over and over on the radio.  Sara is certainly taking the brass ring and running but I hope she stays grounded for as long as she can since the single \\"Love Song\\" can pretty much make an entire career for her without any further Top 40 hits.  I really think she is that great!  Who needs Top 40 when you have a committed audience?  I give this album 4 stars because it's her first album and I am committed to finding out what she'll do next.  Perhaps her next album will be worth the 5 stars I think it will get:)  Play on!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|The Drum mix in the cd is excellent. Even the drum tone is superior  to any mix I ever heard. The snare and bass drum are placed out front. The Vocals and Guitar are placed exactly in their proper place. A lot of diffrent Guitar tones and effects are used on this album compaired to Marks previous work. Lead Guitar work is fantastic. Best CD I ever bought!
B000ZLFALI|4.0|There have been several movies that have tried to make the music of The Beatles a central focus of their reason d'existence. Some - like The Beatles' own [[ASIN:B0000542D2 A Hard Day's Night]] and [[ASIN:B00000JRUQ Yellow Submarine]] - are perfect, some are not (the dismal \\"All This and World War Too\\"). Even the camp classic [[ASIN:B00009APB6 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] was so bad it was worth seeing because of the music. Heck, even the forgettable [[ASIN:B00005TT77 I Am Sam]] raked in a killer soundtrack thanks to John, Paul, George and Ringo.<br /><br />But they've got nothing on \\"Across The Universe.\\" Taking the turmoil and tumult of the sixties and re-imagining it through the lyrics of Beatle's songs, it is a trippy, hallucinogenic ride that is a visual and sonic feast. Jude (from Liverpool, naturally) comes to the US to find his American soldier dad (Robert Clohessy, a regular from [[ASIN:B00031TYBC Oz - The HBO prison drama]]) only to collide with rich kid renegade Max and then to fall for his sister, Lucy. Suddenly, they find themselves in NYC with a Janis Joplinish landlady, Sadie, and her Jimi Hendrixian boyfriend, Jojo.<br /><br />The sixties then take their turn into the war, and the drama unfolds as Jude falls for Lucy (\\"I've Just Seen a Face\\"), Max finds himself drafted (\\"I Want You\\") and Lucy falls under the spell of the anti-war movement leader. Each point is often brilliantly illustrated, and director Julie Taymor tosses subtlety out the window for several of the film's best sequences. In particular, when Prudence sings \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" as a lament for a love that can't speak out loud, football players fly through the air and collide as she walks through them. When Max gets to his indoctrination and the exaggerated GI Joes march in \\"stomp dance\\" style to \\"I Want You,\\" it's breathtaking. While the narrative occasionally falters, the visuals and set pieces never do.<br /><br />Of course, there is the music. While there's nothing earth-shattering here, all the actors acquit themselves just fine. The small handful of cameos are great, especially Joe Cocker singing \\"Come Together\\" as three different characters, and Bono playing the Ken Keasey Electric Kool-Aid guru Dr Robert on the magic bus, promoting his new book titled (heh heh) \\"I Am The Walrus.\\" (I could have done without Eddie Izzard's \\"Being for The Benefit of Mr Kite,\\" even if the sequence is sufficiently madcap.) But this isn't a sloppy kaleidoscope like the [[ASIN:B0000067L8 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band 1978 Soundtrack]] was; other than the three men mentioned prior, there are no stars here. In particular, Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and Jojo (Martin Luther McCoy) give dynamite performances, and other than Evan Rachel Wood, the cast is relatively unknown.<br /><br />I really can't say enough about the pleasure I got from \\"[[ASIN:B000WCBPOG Across The Universe]], and it may be the first time you walk into a theater humming the songs. I was skeptical at first, because many of the reviews I'd read were not kind. But I have a feeling many of them were written by folks of a more tender age, lacking the comprehension of the times portrayed on screen. One of the most fun things about this movie was catching the goofy Beatles' homages sprinkled in the film's dialog (favorite, when Prudence sneaks into the Sadie's communal apartment and someone asked where she comes from, Jude replies \\"she came in through the bathroom window\\").<br /><br />This is also a recommendable movie for one other reason. It isn't. When I say 'it isn't,' I mean, not a sequel, not a rip-off of a TV series (old or new), not a remake and some lowbrow teen sex-romp. There isn't anything cloying or coy, and while the movie is certainly political, the politics you get from it will be what you read out on your own. \\"Across The Universe\\" is as relevant today as it was when when The Beatles sang \\"But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't gonna make it with anyoneanyhow.\\" Grab your popcorn, sit back, relax and float downstream.relax and float downstream.
B00013RC8O|5.0|An oldie, but a goodie!! Forget the remake of this movie, nothing compares to the original.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I bought the original DVD when it came out not knowing about the Director's Cut. I am a history buff so I was thrilled with the story, period costumes and the scenery, but I had many questions about the characters.  I went back to the history books to fill in who the characters were and their relevence to this period of time in the Crusades. Then I discovered this truly magnificent Director's cut and I got my answers.  This is the version that should have been released.  It moved my heart and left my soul full.  The character development of Balian in respect to those around him had depth and richness.  I particularly like seeing the part of the young son and discovering he carried the same disease as his uncle.  Any historian can point to certain genetic illnesses throughout family lines.  I believe this part of the movie developed Sybilla's character and led to the more complex interaction with Balian.  Balian suffers the loss of his wife after the death of his child; on the other hand is in love with a woman who painfully makes the decision to kill her own child to save him suffering the same fate as the uncle.  This film gives you the opportunity to share the feelings of anguish and guilt felt by Balian and Sybilla.    This is the movie version that should be a part of film history for its scope and range of feelings.  The other two DVD commentaries on the development of the movie and its characters were icing on the cake.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|***** 2006. Adapted from a Steven Millhauser short story, [[ASIN:B000K7VHQ4 The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)]] was written and directed by Neil Burger. It's an outstanding love story in the Vienna of the early XXth century. Everything is perfect in this film: the production design, the actors, the Philip Glass musical score and the screenplay. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan's [[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]] was the ultimate movie about magic, then came Neil Burger's masterpiece. What a wonderful year for movie lovers !
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie really touches the heart. It is hard not to walk away with a smile on your face. No wonder it was nominated for 5 Academy Awards. It is a romance but also a comedy and so much more. The introduction to the key character is unique and that playfulness continues throughout the movie. Likewise the musical score is delightful and very French and compliments the movie nicely. So yes, go out and rent this movie. You won't be disappointed.
B000065V41|4.0|This production is a very worthy addition to the many versions of Dickens' classic A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  The Muppets' rendition stays fairly close to the original work with lots of comic relief added by the famous puppets particularly Gonzo playing Charles Dickens himself as an all knowing narrator always accompanied by his sidekick Rizzo the Rat.  As one would expect from a classic story retold by the Muppets this is family friendly fare though to be honest I personally find their interpretation of the Ghost of Christmas Past with her mask life face and little girl voice really creepy.   As in most productions the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come is portrayed in Grim Reaper fashion which also could be disturbing to young kids.  The songs by Paul Williams are good but not quite as good as those in the Broadway musical adaptation of SCROOGE or in the surprisingly excellent Mr. Magoo version of the story.  Michael Caine makes a great live action Scrooge but George C. Scott's portrayal is still my favorite.  Still I love the Muppets and I love Charles Dickens so I have to recommend this movie to anyone looking for a well rendered holiday film for all ages.

1592332803|2.0|I was excited when this book came out as there are so few vegan baking books out there. The photos are impressive, but unfortunately, the recipes are a disappointment. The author seems to have taken standard recipes and switched out the eggs and butter for Ener-G egg replacer and vegan margarine (which she calls vegan butter - isn't this an oxymoron?). There is absolutely nothing creative here! There are no recipes that utilize any of the alternative whole grain flours or unrefined sweeteners out there or different oils, such as coconut, palm ,walnut, safflower,etc.<br /><br />My vegan friends, you can make a delicious pie crust with walnut oil, whole wheat pastry flour and water...and the ingredients don't have to be COLD. You can make fabulous scones with agave nectar and no egg replacer. Please go beyond these tired recipes and BE CREATIVE! Purchase this book if you love all-purpose white flour, Earth Balance spread and Ener-G egg replacer in everything you make.
B000GG4XD8|5.0|Quality-wise, this album is the best studio album in my life. 'Eagle Fly Free,' 'Rise and Fall,' 'Dr. Stein,' 'We Got the Right,' 'March of Time,' 'I Want Out,' 'Keeper of the Seven Keys' are all great songs. The best melodic metal album.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|Funk has been called a lot of things, but I highly doubt \\"creepy\\" was ever on the list before this album came out. But this is a trippy, creepy, minimalist funk album, and one of my favorite Talking Heads albums. The only better one is Remain in Light. This is, as I'm sure you know, a concept album, but you can only find the concept by putting the words \\"fear of\\" in front of every song title. And it works on every song but \\"I Zimbra\\". Watch me... \\"Fear of Mind\\". \\"Fear of Paper\\". \\"Fear of Cities\\". \\"Fear of Life During Wartime\\". \\"Fear of Memories (Can't Wait)\\". \\"Fear of Air\\". \\"Fear of Heaven\\". \\"Fear of Animals\\". \\"Fear of Electric Guitar\\". \\"Fear of Drugs\\". Not only does it apply to the titles, it applies to the lyrics. For instance, the alien-sounding \\"Air\\" has lyrics about being hurt by air; the funky, James Brown-like \\"Paper\\" uses holding paper up to the light as a metaphor for exposing the ugly truths in people's lives; \\"Memories Can't Wait\\" - which also has a paranoid musical backdrop, all tension and no release - seems to be about schizophrenia, which I assume would involve lots of fear; the lovely \\"progressive country\\" ballad \\"Heaven\\" dismisses it as \\"a place where nothing ever happens\\" - Byrne's fear of perpetual boredom, if you will; the slow, droning, controversial \\"Overload\\" prequel \\"Drugs\\" seems to describe a hangover. All right, looking at all those, you'd think the scariest song on this album would be \\"Life During Wartime\\", since that's pretty scary. But it's not! It's a catchy disco-funk song! You can really get down and groove to it, and I love the lyrics. Great song, and it was their first hit single for a good reason. There are a couple breaks from all the fear, though. \\"I Zimbra\\" is a fun, funky bit of worldbeat nonsense with a fantastic guitar solo courtesy of Robert Fripp; and \\"Cities\\", with stupid lyrics about moving, is a pure funky good time. But those two songs are a couple of my favorites on the album! Along with all the other \\"fear\\" tracks I mentioned. Now, I don't think every song is as good as those, like \\"Mind\\" (though that's a hell of a guitar solo) or \\"Electric Guitar\\" (nice mood, though), but those songs are likeable; the only bomb is the pointless, inane rant \\"Animals\\". This is certainly the most accessible Eno album, even if it isn't the best: More Songs About Buildings and Food doesn't have as strong of songwriting (though it's still good), and Remain in Light is probably too dense and neurotic for those not already accustomed to the Talking Heads, though it's their masterpiece. So once you've got Name of This Band or a compilation, this should be your next Talking Heads purchase.entioned.

B00005JPTI|3.0|2.5 Stars    I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I'd seen a few commercials, but I didn't have any idea what it was about, and I had no real desire to see it, except that a friend of mine wanted to go, and asked me to come along.    I loved the first half-hour or so of this film. Seeing empty, overgrown Manhattan streets is surreal and eerie, even on a clear day with bright sunshine and the occasional bird singing. Anybody who has ever been to New York City should appreciate how wonderfully chilling it feels to hear virtual SILENCE in the city streets. The atmosphere is incredible, the details are amazing (be sure to check out the gas prices; you'll wince), and the whole setting is extremely well done. Enter Will Smith, the last man on Earth... sort of. Manhattan is his playground (and his hunting ground); he has the whole place to himself. And he makes some very interesting use of it. His antics are amusing, and truly fun to watch; even better, it makes you think about what it might really be like to be the last person alive on Earth. And better still, they make some sense (considering that such solitude would make anybody at least a little crazy); they're actually BELIEVABLE. Until the mutant zombie vampire things show up. After that, it's pure cliched horror movie shtick, and that's when the trouble starts.    First of all, the CGI mutant zombie vampire things are just BAD. REALLY bad. They don't look real, and they're not scary; we've seen creatures like them done before, and done better. The scares are limited to cheap (and predictable) shock moments where a loud noise makes you jump after a prolonged quiet. But I digress. Even the CGI animals early in the movie are unconvincing, which is a problem in this day and age. Given the budget expended for this film, they definitely could have done better.    Second, the final hour or so is riddled with plot holes. The first half of the movie shows that Manhattan is completely cut off from the rest of the world. The bridges have been blown up and the tunnels are flooded. So where do the other uninfected characters come from? How does Will Smith single-handedly fortify his house with steel closures and explosives, and build a fully-stocked medical lab in his basement? Where does he get his electricity from, if everybody else is dead? The film doesn't even attempt to answer these questions; it's probably better for it, given how clumsily the story was handled. Still, the second half does have a few good moments, but they're never put to use. In one scene halfway through the film, something happens that suggests that the mutant zombie vampire things are actually intelligent and crafty, and maybe even organized and social. It would have been a nice twist, but that idea is never capitalized on; it immediately gets thrown by the wayside, and the CGI baddies revert to incessant screaming, rushing at Will Smith in mindless zombie fashion, and performing superhuman feats which are completely unbelievable. They scramble up the facades of buildings like Spiderman, for crying out loud!    And lastly, the ending is pure Hollywood. Will Smith goes out with a bang, and conveniently saves the world in the process, and what's left of humanity lives happily ever after, yada yada yada. It's horrible, and even preachy. Through it all, Will Smith remains watchable, though, and he manages to save this film from being completely forgettable.    What awesome promise this movie showed in its first few minutes. It could have been a wonderful psychological drama; why they chose to turn it into a cheap horror movie wannabe is beyond me. It could have been great. The first third of it *IS* great. But then it falls apart.
0812975219|4.0|I like this book because it's intellectually stimulating. It doesn't matter that I don't agree with some parts, while others I agree with strongly. What matters is that it makes you think of things you haven't thought about before. And that's the most important part.    I agree with the main theme of the book, that people underestimate the role of chance and overestimate their skills. It's cool, and often funny, to see the book discuss many of examples of this.     I disagree that financial markets are a random walk. I think there's a lot of randomness there, but since people are involved I think there's got to be a lot of non random characteristics.    If markets were purely random, in the mathematical sense, I don't think people like Taleb, even mathematicians, could make money trading.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins points out that we are all atheists. We don't believe in Zeus, Thor, Apollo, etc., and he just goes one god further. \\"The God Delusion\\" is vital reading for everyone, but unfortunately, the authors message of advocacy for science and rationalism is only likely to reach the already converted - religious schisms are all too well ingrained in our society still. Dawkins views religion as not only an irrational practice, but also a dangerous one - in his view, even acknowledging moderate religious practices ultimately leads to fundamentalist extremes.<br /><br />\\"Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.\\" (Seneca The Yonger).  The books message is aimed at a reader who is not particularly religious, and the author tries to show that life can still have a purpose when one chooses to free himself of delusions of organized religion.<br /><br />As any other good book, \\"The God Delusion\\" requires an open mind, a critical eye, and a few evenings of thought. Whether you choose to agree or disagree with the arguments is up to you, but for all intents and purposes, it is a book that everyone should have a chance to leaf through.
B000N3ST7K|2.0|There are some great songs on here, but they all sound terrible!  Tons of digital artifacts and distortion.  I've listened on several CD players and it always sounds the same: low quality, high distortion.  Totally distracting for me... ruins the disc.  A disappointment.
B00005JPTI|4.0|The movie starts out with Will Smith seemingly the only person left after a few clips throughout the film show piece by piece what got him there.  Everything is bright and sunny, with him riding around an isolated NYC with his dog.  After a while though, his alarm on his watch starts going off, and he heads home, while the dark starts creeping up he gets in and closes off his house, windows and all.  You then hear horrible, demonish sounds outside.  You get it that this is a nightly routine for him. You do get a couple of great scenes that are scary in this, but the movie really plays up on his sense of isolation and aloneness. I think the reason my husband didn't like it was because of the time it took to get established.  I don't think the story would have worked had he just all of a sudden started with the monsters, it had to tell what his life was to that point, and how it started to change.  Anyway, pretty good movie if you feel like seeing one!

B000092T6M|3.0|NB: Since Amazon are posting reviews for this under both the rival Costner and Patrick Bergin versions, this review is for the Costner version.    It's Hollywood, not Sherwood, with Kevin Costner fighting injustice in his quest to make England free for those who can't actually speak the language, armed only with his trusty longbow, a dubious accent (\\"This is English courage\\" gets a big laugh every time), a fluctuating waistline and an unerringly bad sense of direction. \\"Come, by nightfall we will dine at my father's castle,\\" he says to his Muslim sidekick Azem (Morgan Freeman). Not when you land in Dover you won't. And Hadrian's Wall is NOT \\"but five miles\\" from Nottingham. Sorry, Kev.     You have to look a long way down the credits to find an English actor, unless you count the villains, with Alan Rickman's Sheriff so far over the top that he's back again, leaving you with the impression that Costner's controversial decision to cut many of his scenes had more to do with restraint than pique. With Christian I-Want-to-be-Jack-Nicholson-when-I-grow-up Slater in the cast, you can forgiven for fearing the film will turn into Surf Saxons Must Die, and British writers Pen Densham and John Watson do display a healthy contempt for their heritage and history. No-one actually says it, but you know they're thinking \\"screw history, let's blow something up,\\" and, indeed, the script manages to pull of the twin feat of giving a logical reason for Robin having a black sidekick and getting lots of explosions into a medieval adventure, although they don't quite manage to convince you that their Robin truly is modelled after the Tim Holt character in The Magnificent Ambersons.     Neither Errol Flynn's definitive adventure nor Sean Connery and Richard Lester's brilliantly melancholy interpretation have anything to worry about, with the film falling between the two stools and offering political correctness instead of revisionism and opting for pure adventure with the trimmings of gritty historical realism brushed aside whenever it threatens to get in the way.     The biggest problem is that the scars of a messy and acrimonious production (seven credited producers, no less) are all too visible. Kevin Reynolds' direction lacks the punch of his earlier and unfairly overlooked The Beast of War or even his bonkers Rapa Nui, with some uncomfortable medium shots and the unsteadiest Steadicam work in cinema history, while subplots such as the black magic element are thrown away after the early scenes. On the plus side, Michael Kamen's score is his most enjoyable and exciting, John Bloomfield's costumes are terrific, Doug Milsome's photography almost camouflages the bad weather and some of the action scenes are well handled, although it's hard to imagine anyone here giving Basil Rathbone or even Robert Shaw too much trouble in a swordfight.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This is the first movie I have ever watched that evoked such heartfelt emotions from me. I found myself sobbing as I watched people report again and again of the poor care they have received in America for their illnesses. We need socialized medicine! I am a nursing student and healthcare is very important to me. I am one of the people who have never had insurance as an adult and who avoids the doctor at all costs since I cannot afford a visit. Soon I will be employed in the healthcare industry and be able to afford insurance. I am wondering whether that will actually fix anything. I am 32 years old with two children of my own. My goal is to push socialized medicine on America and try to make sure that my children never have the problems shown in this film. If we all get on this bandwagon, the legislation will have to be passed. Like the film said, in France the government fears the people, in the U.S. the people fear the government. I think it is time for a change!
B0009QTS1M|5.0|The extended cut of Gladiator still has many of the problems of the original but doesn't feel as disjointed or quite so disappointing. It's not just that it has more room to breathe, more that the additional footage, particularly the scenes away from Maximus where the future of Rome takes center-stage, raise the stakes beyond the simplistic revenge tale the theatrical version all too often settled for. The climactic fight with Commodus is still a major disappointment not just because it's so underwhelmingly staged but because, unlike The Fall of the Roman Empire, the film it relentlessly plagiarises, Commodus is never a credible threat: where Mann gave him foolhardy courage, Scott has implied he's a coward throughout until even a wounded hero can't even the odds. It's still no Fall, but it is a more satisfying film than the one released in cinemas. Very impressive extra features too.
B00005JPTI|4.0|Richard Matheson's 1954 novel \\"I Am Legend\\" is universally, and rightly, considered a touchstone in modern horror and science fiction literature.  Its story of one man's fight for survival in a world of undead caused by a horrific plague has been the offspring for countless cinematic variations (e.g., NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and 28 DAYS LATER), and two overt cinematic adaptations--1964's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with Vincent Price); and 1971's THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston).  And now, in our time, it is Will Smith's turn to take up the role of humankind's last best hope in this third adaptation of Matheson's book, using its original title this time.    Smith stars as Robert Neville, a virologist who had, in the year 2009, played a pivotal role in the development of a viral cure for cancer that instead turned into a violent plague that decimated the world.  Now, in the year 2012, he roams the deserted streets of the Big Apple with his trusted dog Samantha, foraging for supplies, sending out radio calls into the void in the off-chance that there are real survivors out there--and getting back to his townhouse before nightfall.  For it is nightfall that the Dark Seekers, those plague survivors who have turned into horrible mutants, come out to make his life a living hell.    Smith's rationale for staying alive amidst all this horror is the development of a vaccine that can reverse the spread of the virus--a vaccine that he tries on Dark Seekers that he captures.  It also helps him maintain his sanity, as he has terrible flashbacks to the beginnings of the plague.  Once he encounters a totally normal woman (Alice Braga) who has survived in a colony in Vermont, he sees a ray of hope for humanity.  But will he be able to make the promise he made to himself years before come true?    It has to be said that, much like the two other films based on it, I AM LEGEND strays significantly from its source material (the monsters in the book are vampires, and the setting is LosAngeles, not New York).  Indeed, this third version takes its cue as much from the John Corrington/Joyce Corrington screenplay of THE OMEGA MAN as it does from Matheson's book, particularly in Smith's attempt to develop a cure for the plague.  Also, the Dark Seekers, as they are conceived, look a little too much like what they really are, namely CGI creations, as opposed to the pale vampires of THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, or the Manson-like mutant cult of THE OMEGA MAN.    All the same however, I AM LEGEND works well enough because Smith, who holds the screen all by himself for three-fourths of its running time, is able to convince us of his character's situation--concern; panic; horror; and much more.  Though some of the special effects are a tad bit excessive on occasion, director Francis Lawrence and screenwriters Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevitch manage to conjure up enought suspenseful situations to make this enterprise more than tolerable, and on many occasions very frightening.    It may be that Matheson's book is unfilmable the way Matheson wrote it, what with Hollywood's concern for thrills and chills at the expense of the novel's psychological and scientific horror.  But Smith's performance and the scenes of a completely deserted Big Apple are more than enough to paper over the flaws, and make I AM LEGEND a very good cross of horror and science fiction the likes of which have not really been seen in Hollywood for quite some time.
B000065FWT|3.0|There wasn't a truly successful sword and sorcery film until Peter Jackson got into the act, and despite a liberal helping of trolls, brownies, dragons (bearing a bit of an unfortunate resemblance to a two-headed version of the Penosaurus from Flesh Gordon) and fairies, Willow certainly didn't break the run. Rather than going the Conan  route, producer George Lucas adheres to the Star Wars formula in the form of Pat Roach's Darth Vader clone, the skull-masked General Kael, Val Kilmer's Han Solo-esque hero, Joanne  Whalley's headstrong princess and Patricia Hayes' Obi-Wan Kenobi figure, among numerous other visual and narrative  touches, with magic standing in for the Force as the power that holds the universe together and helps our diminutive hero triumph.<br /><br />Even if Willow isn't as much fun as you would like it to be, it holds up surprisingly well with age. Kilmer's no Harrison Ford (and his ex-missus is never at her best when acting with an American accent for that matter) and this is no Star Wars, but if you don't expect too much it's a nice enough fantasy adventure with some magical effects (although, coming from a lowpoint in ILM's output, there are a few too many matte lines in places) and a few (intentionally) funny moments en route to a terrific last half-hour.<br /><br />The major liability is director Ron Howard, who makes 500 extras look like five at one point and could handle the action better, although he certainly fares better than Peter Yates and Krull, which really pushed an audience's best wishes to the limit. Although Howard doesn't do much with the Scope frame, it's certainly a better film in widescreen than panned-and-scanned on TV, and it boasts one of James Horner's very best scores (albeit one that seems heavily influenced by Bruce Smeaton's score for Iceman). There's also a decent extras package as well audio commentary by Warwick Davis; featurettes Willow - Making of an Adventure and Morf to Morphing - The Dawn of Digital Filmmaking;stills gallery; 8 TV spots; 2 teaser trailers and full theatrical trailer.

6305358613|4.0|Partially reinventing the period movie, stylistically at least, almost as radically as Martin Scorsese reinvented the Biblical epic with his Last Temptation, Shekhur Kapur's account of the insecure early days of Elizabeth I's reign, Elizabeth, is a claustrophobic film set in a dark world of cold grey stone, alternating overhead shots with tight medium shots rather than stressing spectacle or glamour, more political thriller than costume epic. Indeed, with its bloody finale clearly inspired by The Godfather as Walsingham takes care of business for his Capo di tutti Capo, it's almost a mafia movie, with Cate Blanchett's star-making turn as Elizabeth filling in the Michael Corleone role as the heir apparent who must ruthlessly shed emotions and conscience to hold on to the throne. That journey from fresh-faced youth to impregnable white-faced icon gives the film a solid emotional arc that helps prevent it from becoming a simple series of confrontations and thwarted conspiracies, almost - but not quite - turning it into a tragedy of success rather than the usual tragedy of failure that is usually the lot of women in historical pictures (Anne of the Thousand Days, Mary Queen of Scots, Lady Jane, La Reine Margot, etc).     It's handsomely cast: Joseph Fiennes gives good shallow romanticism as Elizabeth's lover Dudley, Christopher Eccleston in his default misery guts mode makes a fine villain and there's a healthy cast that, if not bursting with A-listers, is at least filled with familiar faces, from Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardant, Daniel Craig and Vincent Cassel in a dress to Edward Hardwicke, Kelly McDonald, James Frain, Emily Mortimer and Eric Cantona. Yet perhaps even more than Blanchett it's a magnificent Geoffrey Rush who often dominates the film from the sidelines as the Queen's loyal and utterly unscrupulous spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, a man who can seem all things to all men and women but is loyal only to her. Even when he's simply observing from afar he's a powerful presence in all the right ways, emanating a callous intelligence that is truly frightening.     It's strange that the sequel has been attacked by the Vatican as anti-Catholic when this first chapter probably occupies a high place on Ian Paisley's Ten Best List, what with Kathy Burke's psychotic \\"Bloody\\" Mary burning Protestants and threatening to do the same to her half-sister and John Gielgud's Pope (earning fifth billing for barely two minutes' screen time) despatching Daniel Craig's priest to assassinate the Protestant queen not merely with his blessing but his promises of a welcome in heaven for any who help in the task. Not entirely inaccurate considering the many attempts by Catholic kingdoms like France and Spain to topple or assassinate Elizabeth during her reign, but a little more historical context might have been helpful for viewers not so familiar with Tudor politics and the causes and effects of the Reformation. It doesn't help that Michael Hirst's screenplay refers to Marie de Guise (Ardant) as Mary, Queen of Scots, leading some to assume she's [I]the[/I] famous Mary, Queen of Scots rather than her mother, but then the problem of just how much historical information you can include before it gets in the way of the drama is always a difficult one in a period film: too little and you don't know what's happening, too much and you feel like you should be taking notes in case there's a test later. Instead, this is content to follow Elizabeth's rise at the expense not just of her enemies but also some of her early friendships, keeping it personal even as Elizabeth has to shed her own personality to create an icon a divided nation can follow. It's certainly not flawless, but it's never dull and often impressive.

I have not seen any of the shorter versions of this film, and yes, this is one long movie, but I really dug it.    It's the kind of dense, meaty movie that has dozens of main characters, the beautiful people are REALLY beautiful, and the bad guys are REALLY hideous. The palaces are opulent, the costumes are exquisite, the action scenes are thrilling...    The set pieces work, for the most part. The siege, the Trojan Horse, the Hector/Achilles duel...LOVED 'em.    The Helen/Paris thing didn't quite DO it for me, and since that is ostensibly the reason for this whole \\"war\\" thing...it detracts.    The dialogue is more literate than cheesy, the cinematography is GORGEOUS...it's a terrifically made film.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|No matter what people may think of Michael Moore, they will be hard-pressed to counter his film \\"Sicko\\" with one of a contrarian view. I suppose \\"Sickohype\\" or Sickohypo\\" or \\"Let'em all Die\\" just doesn't have the same resonance as \\"Fahrenhype\\" did to challenge his previous film.<br /><br />Perhaps as landmark as Jacob Riis's \\"How the Other Half Lives,\\" \\"Sicko\\" brings the devastating cost and state of health care in this country to light beginning with people who have lived the American dream and expected to live their retirement independently and in comfort. Early on, Moore shows a working couple forced to sell their home to meet medical obligations not covered, and now depend on the charity of their children. Moore carefully singles out several cases of the twenty-five thousand emails he received that reveal the appalling state of health care in a country that nurtures that dream. (None of the stories or emails are about couples in separate bathtubs looking out over a vineyard).<br /><br />First are the insurance companies that are out to make a profit. (Nothing's wrong with that). However, the profit is at the expense of the medical coverage and preventative care they can deny. If they cannot deny it outright or claim such care is experimental, they will pour through a patient's medical history to see if any condition occurred that was not mentioned or remembered in the application process. This will give the company the means to deny all claims retroactively. Incidentally, doctors receive bonuses for the most claims they can deny!<br /><br />The next spotlight is on the pharmaceutical companies which are so expensive that many people must continue working well beyond their retirement years, years they should be enjoying, years when there is the greatest need for medication. In particular, Moore singles out the very new and complicated prescription plan, which is more expensive for seniors than ever before, but benefits the pharmaceuticals. (Thank you, Mr. Bush).<br /><br />Besides our illustrious president benefitting from the contributions of pharmaceuticals, Moore identifies a host of other republicans who have had their hands in drug company pockets--including the lady who was going to provide universal health care in the first place--Hillary Clinton whose plan the drug companies spent $100,000,000 to defeat. Fourteen staffers who worked on the Seniors' Prescription bill, moved on to lucrative lobby positions with the same companies, and Billy Tauzin was hired as CEO for Pharma at $2,000,000 a year. In any other milieu, that is called bribery, corruption, and conflict of interest. In Congress, it's called the cost of doing business.<br /><br />But what gives Americans a strong sense of pride is our belief that our medical system and healthcare, while flawed, is the finest in the world. Moore is quick to write \\"denied\\" all over that fantasy. We see in Canada, Great Britain, and France, how people receive first rate health care, from first rate physicians without having to sell their homes, decide which finger they can afford to save, and have a higher life expectancy than Americans. (Doctors in Britain are actually paid more for getting people into better health habits and regimens).<br /><br />Misnamed socialized medicine by its detractors, socialized insurance works in these countries efficiently without people crowding in waiting rooms, being taxed to death (as the health companies would have us believe), or dying because they cannot afford the medication, or because the insurance company denied their claim. Moore implies that paying higher taxes makes more sense than losing your homes or retirement to catastrophic illness in what is now the leading cause of bankruptcy in the country.<br /><br />Moore's direction is flawless. His graphics and humor are engaging; dry and deprecating. This is a film that may make you well-up with tears that a society could take such good care of its companies and business, and dump its destitute on the street. Moore succeeds in making you feel empathy for those who are poorly treated or not at all. He is able to make you think: \\"Can that happen to me?\\" or \\"If it can work there, why can't it work here?\\"<br /><br />The special edition also offers more in-depth discussion of health care that could not be put in the original film. This includes conversations with people on the street, HR 636 brought before the house, Norway which has the highest standard of health care in the world. (Yes, it is free). Sadly it also shows some of the people from the film whose family members died for lack of treatment, or because they were turned away.<br /><br />The final irony of the film is one of the more poignant. The man who runs the most virulent anti-Michael Moore website announced that he would have to shut down because he couldn't afford the hospital care his wife so desperately needed.<br /><br />Guess what Moore did.<br /><br />God bless us everyone.feel empathy for those who are poorly treated or not at all.

0719561027|1.0|Here's the story:     Rich guy with a supportive family leaves all that for addiction.    Hits a pretty low (but interesting) rock bottom.    Goes to a rehab on his parents' dime.    Gets his teeth fixed (with or without aneasthesia?).  Decides he can do sobriety without AA.  Fair enough, but keep reading.  Befriends, instead, a recovering mafioso, and also plans a life with a woman whom he has illicitly begun a relationship while in rehab. She commits suicide soon after leaving.  Rich guy moves to LA, writes manuscripts and screenplays.  Submits his memoir on his experiences through the end of rehab.    Publishers reject it.  Makes revisions that fictionalize it.  Anaethesia for dental work is probably subtracted.  Resubmits the manuscript, again billed as a memoir.  The book is published and receives emphatic praise from Oprah Winfrey.  His fortune is assured.  He writes the second book, My Friend Lenny, which tells you a whole lot more about who James Frey is.  Begins an \\"arms race of suffering\\" for authors of memoirs.  How much do we need to suffer to equal Frey's fictional account?  Frey's dishonesty is discovered.  Embarrassment and blame passing among Frey's editors, publishers and promotors.  We paid him for the book.  He laughs all the way to the bank.    I'd like my money back, at the very least.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Musical romances are tough to sell to today's audiences and they are usually awkward. Trying to make one as an independent feature minus all the Hollywood gloss and big production numbers is even tougher but then this film isn't your typical combination of music, drama and romance.<br /><br />\\"Once\\" manages to be both bold and marvelous at the same time. This delightful film tells the story of an Irish musician (Glen Hansard) who falls for a classically trained piano player and Czech immigrant (Marketa Irglova) who is living with her daughter and mother. The two discover a surprising musical compatibility as well in addition to their unexpected romance. A small independent release that disappeared from theaters as quickly as it opened, \\"Once\\" is one of those films that you can delightfully discover as it moves on to its second life on home video without feeling guilty about the quality.<br /><br />Hansard who plays in the rock band Frames brings his character to life as much through song as he does through performance. Written and directed by Hansard's band mate John Carney, the film takes a bit to take off but once it does it soars. This isn't your fantasy musical however and Carney doesn't shy away from showing the hardship that two street musicians face in a world that largely gives them an unsympathetic ear.<br /><br />The film looks quite good on DVD considering its low budget nature and feeling that it was shot on the fly. Audio sounds quite good as well with a crisp, clear quality that one might not expect on an independent film such as this.<br /><br />We get an observant and intelligent commentary track by director Carney and his stars. They discuss everything from their characters in the film to making music. There is also a track specific commentary track with the trio as well. \\"Making a Modern Day Musical\\" is a very good featurette that focuses on the challenges that Carney faced with the musical genre as well as the difficulties he and the cast faced in trying to pull it off convincingly. \\"More Guy, More Girl\\" focuses on the unnamed main characters and their relationship.

B000LAZDQA|2.0|We have spent many years in recovery from the film code of 1932. It forever established that sex was dirty and should be relegated to the realm of porn in order to preserve community values. While today's mainstream filmmakers routinely deal with explicit sexuality, it is usually done with a heavy hand.  This films use of real sexual encounters in a FUN context is to be applauded. It shows that sex can be at least as enjoyable as a good comedy and doesn't have to be loaded down with adolescent angst. We do all get to grow up one day don't we? SO, WHY DID I RATE THIS WITH ONLY TWO STARS??<br /><br /> I can only assume that this DVD got such good reviews because the first copies that were distributed were created with a decent grade of DVD. That is no longer the case. The copy I received was not only produced on the thinnest DVD that I have ever seen, but it was scraped up so badly that it will only play on one of my machines. The damage was done to the copy before it was packaged as the packaging was in perfect shape. Unfortunately I lost my Amazon receipt prior to opening it and can't return the copy. If you dare to buy a copy of this film, keep your return papers handy! Hopefully if enough people complain the producer will upgrade the DVD quality.

B00004SA86|3.0|I tried very hard to like this complete set of Mahler symphonies. In the end, I was not very satisfied and do not recommend it. The more I got to know this set, the less I liked it.<br /><br />The recordings themselves are very easy to listen to. The sound is closely miked, and the feeling is rather small and intimate, and very pleasing. This helps the complicated textures and fluid tempos. It also robs the music of its power, drama, magic, and majesty. I also note a tendency towards too fast tempi. The quaint, drawing room atmosphere and almost chamber orchestra feeling can be illustrative, but is also a significant drawback. It sort of reminds me of Cliff Notes: you get form but no substance or flavor. Upon hearing this collection, one can be forgiven for thinking that Mahler is a brilliant orchestral technician but a mediocre symphonist. With this conductor, the music can become tedious; this is not the proper reaction to works of a musical genius. Much of this cycle was just not as interesting as it should have been.<br /><br />Symphony #1<br />Kubelik at his best. A bright, happy, sunny romp through the countryside.<br /><br />Symphony #2<br />Kubelik does a lousy job of coalescing the rather disparate movements.

The alto was not very good.<br /><br />Symphony #4<br /> Light, airy, childlike, almost romantic. Very nearly definitive.<br /><br />Symphony #5<br />The cheery attitude makes the music less lugubrious than usual, but it also lacks substance. All bark and no bite.<br /><br />Symphony #6<br />Too fast tempi sabotages the music; it just doesn't sound right (sounds more like a railroad journey than a catharsis).

B000TKW3E2|5.0|Well, it's so good to know, that once the great composers, such as John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, Maurice Jarre, and so on, will be gone, the film music lovers won't be left with the void of silence. Dario Marianelli is one of the greatest hopes of film music today. His masterful Oscar-nominated score for Pride and Prejudice drew attention on him right away, and we are not dissapointed in him this time either. Marianelli's music for the beautiful romantic drama Atonement starring Keira Knightley and James MacAwoy, and directed by Joe Wwright(who directed P&P, as his brilliant first feature film) is nothing less than great. His themes are sweeping, and fluent, like a buquet of floating emotions. I particularly liked the use of an extraordinary percussionlike sound, a circa 1935-typewriter, which is, no dobt, a unique choice of the composer. Altogether I can state without regret, that Dario Marianelli's own musical style and presence in the world of modern film music is firm as a rock, and his Gloden Globe-nominated score for Atonement can aspire easily for a well deserved Academy Award for best original score in 2008.

I called again a couple of days later and a young man - I think he said his name was Jesse - apologized for the mix-up and sent out my order overnight delivery (free to me). It arrived the next day. I was very satisfied with customer service.

B000UJBYD8|2.0|I am a lifelong fan of The Cult. This album is disappointing for several reasons. First - Billy Duffy does not play enough guitar. Billy proved early on in his career to be a blistering soloist, but he doesn't do any of the \\"Electric\\" era soloing on this. The second problem is that the production is all wrong on this. It sounds kind of low-budget and watery to me, where I prefer the Rick Rubin or Bob Rock clean amped up sound for this band. Third, the  lyrics seem like they were thown dowm in a hurry, and Ian is flat out losing his voice, although he still sounds cool. The songs, fo the most part, are kind of flat and uninspired, and Dirty Little Rockstar is a complete rip-off of Undercover by the Stones. Two stars because its the Cult, but I'm pretty bummed overall.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Simply said, this is a cd of \\"beautiful\\" music from a beautiful artist. Very soothing and enjoyable.
B00000AF95|5.0|Kiss Aminalize from 1984, the only album they made with Mark St. John, is my personal favorie after Ace and Peter. Mark had the edge of Vinnie Vincent, and the skills of Bruce Kulick but with more balls and guts. Kulick is a really good player, but just kind of unadventureous and never gutsy. Mark sort of brough the best qualityies of all other Kiss guitarists into one player. Sad that he had to leave the group due to illness. Anyway Animalize is a heavy Kiss album, sort of like Creatures of the Night with a slight pop hint. I really like Gene's contributions to this record - it was kind of right before he went to do some acting and lost focus on Kiss for a while. After Animalize it was Paul's band for several years, and the music took a stronger pop lean. In my opinion there is not a bad track on Animalize. From the opening in-your-face slam of I've Had Enough (a very catchy, yet also heavy song) to the campy sing-a-long choruses of Burn Bitch Burn, to the rare-for-Kiss \\"f bombs\\" of Get All You Can Take... enjoyable all the way through. The hit single, Heaven's On Fire, although extremely catchy, is actually one of the weaker songs on the album in my opinion. If you like Kiss, make sure you get Animalize - it's a very good one from their discography. Standout tracks include: I've Had Enough, Burn Bitch Burn, Get All You Can Take, Thrills In The Night, While the City Sleeps.
B000VSBX34|4.0|This is a darn near perfect movie. It doesn't miss a beat. Or an oppurtunity. There are so many one-liners in this you could fill ten movies with them. The music- of course- is still fantastic and for those of us who were there, it is great to hear it again as it was; and for those who weren't, maybe it will give an idea of why the Beatles were and still are beyond anything that has happened before or since. This fully captures the spirit of play that brought about the possibilities of the 60's and changed the world. This is one time you can look back on the good ol days and it really was. Coupled with Hard Days Night and you can recapture a special moment in the history of the world: Beatles forever!
B0000542D2|3.0|I just watched A hard Day's Night on DVD.  The quality of the sound and video are average at best.  It is still the Beatles; however, and any time with the Beatles is quality time.  This movie was fun because of the interaction between the band members and the silliness of John.  This is required viewing for a Beatles fan.  There is little here for non-Beatles fans.  The music is still as wonderful as ever, I just expected the sound to be much better.  I was disappointed in the extras, or lack thereof.  This was a three star viewing experience... not bad but not what it could have been.
1416914285|3.0|I really have mixed feelings about whether or not I liked this book. On the plus side, I really think the universe Clare created was quite original. Of course there are vague tones of Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc. but seeing as how the aforementioned were also inspired by various stories and myths, I don't see a problem with it. I also found the pacing to be acceptable and gave a good back story for the upcoming novels.  But the characters...well, I hate to say it, but Clary was one of the most uninteresting and cliche characters I've ever read about, and I didn't even like her until maybe 2/3s through the book. Jace has the potential to be a great character if the author could concentrate more on his development then on his witty one-liners. If you've read Clare's infamous fanfiction, you'll surely recognize her Draco, complete with the hawk story(although it's a pretty good story). But since I have a weakness for cynical, angsty guys(in literature, anyhow), I can't help but like Jace. Simon is also a pretty good character, although I can't really understand what he(or Jace) sees in Clary.   As for all the negative hype this book is getting, I really think it's unwarranted and inappropriate, and has more to do with personal vendettas against the author than the quality of the book. The book isn't perfect...but it grabbed my attention enough to want to read the next book. So in that sense, the author did her job.
0553382179|5.0|This book offered me much more than just home organization.  In addition to great practical ideas I laughed and cried and learned a better way to live and love my family.
B000NQPZCO|5.0|This is one of my favorite Depp or Pacino movies. These two make a great mob/ wiseguy flick that delivers on all fronts. Good suspense, great acting, great plot, and its all based on a true story. Not to mention the sound and picture quality on this edition! If you like mob or gangster movies and you have an HDTV, then you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this release, pronto!
0743487486|5.0|This book was a smash hit for me.  I am a different mommy now.  It's not a simple \\"how to\\" book, but it has been the most important parenting advice I have ever received.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|The quality of the package and discs are perfect, no complaints.  Episodes are in order with the booklet.  I wish they had a little more on the special features since this is supposedly The Last Season.  I will miss the adventures in Stars Hollow with The Gilmore Girls and their family and friends.
1932907009|5.0|Half way through the description of the genre applicable to my current script, I realized what my biggest problems were.  As I continued, more and more of Blake Snyder's lucid descriptions seemed to be aimed right at my writing - what was wrong, and, more important, how to fix it.  When I finished, I was very glad that the somewhat presumptuous title was inaccurate, since the sequel to the last book on screenwriting I'll ever need (Save the Cat! Goes To The Movies) dispelled more of the mystery and provided immediately useable from-the-trenches guidance.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|beowulf and grendel is just one of those movies that no matter what it's going to be watched over and over again. this story has been around forever and to be shared in this way is great. i really liked it, not over the top, just there. on the real. takes you on a different ride, and makes you feel it on so many levels. you get to take a look on both sides. the heros and the monster. a tale of a warrior, beowulf, who brings his fellow troops across the seas to help a friend who is king. help him rid himself of a monsterous troll, grendel, who is on a murderous rampage on his land. yet when beowulf challenges grendel, the troll, to fight he refuses. beowulf is confused, and angry, but grendel will not fight because beowulf has done nothing to him. grendel only seeks revenge on those who hurt him first. beowulf is torn between his loyalty to his dear friend, and this trolls right to justice. there is more to grendel, the troll, than meets the eye. under that monster lies a heart like any other. grendel feels and hurts just like any one. the movie was done extremely well, i enjoyed it, and if you have not seen it then you should. the story is one of legend, and the filming was something else. the actors did a good job, and gerard butler is one of my all time favorites. great actor, just adds magic to this movie. it's hard to get any better than this.
0143038419|1.0|Just because someone practices gluttony for a year, chants in a ashram and screws around in Bali doesn't mean they had a spiritual experience.  This is pathetic and one of the most self-absorbed ramblings in recorded history.  Does the world really need a field guide for selfishness?  Can't they just watch a few minutes of Joel Osteen?
B00005JPTI|5.0|\\"I am Legend\\" is one of my favorite stories, it is the Grandfather of the Zombie genre, even though it is a vampire story, King and Romero have cited it as long time inspiration (King's most recent \\"Cell\\" as well,haveing been so borrowed from and seen so much film-versions already, I worried about what this latest project could bring worth retelling. But the imagery alone makes this worth seeing. The \\"Last Man on Earth\\" traveling through \\"real\\" NYC locales stark and empty while hunting CGI deer in a Muscle car is so striking, it will stay with us as moviegoers for some time to come. Like many of the moments in the film. Smith is in most every shot and spends much of the movie bouncing dialogue off dogs, dummies and the camera. He is superb in what may be his best dramatic performance yet.  He sells the character clinging to the tattered shreds of normalcy, swapping DVD like rentals at the corner store, watch old newscasts, etc. Purists of the original work maybe disgruntled by the changes made to the 50 year-old classic novel, but they make the movie a tighter, stark and relevant vehicle.
1595141715|5.0|This book was incredible.  Jay Asher does a great job of getting all the emotions in this book perfect.  It had me laughing and crying and I have passed this along to other people to be read.  Highly recommend everyone pick up a copy!
B000OV170W|4.0|I am not sure what made me pick up this book.  I am typically not into authors who mass produce books, but for some reason I picked it up and couldn't put it down.  The story was rather typical, one daughter has life threatening cancer, the other was conceived just so she could help her sister, but that is where the story stopped being typical.  Once the healthy sister reached a certain age, she go tired of being a human pin cushion and the events that follow are tragic.  The story explores family dynamics and the effects of that sort of stress on the family as a whole.  I really like that the story was told from various perspectives because it allowed the novel to be less two-dimensional.  I only gave the book 4 stars because I believe the ending was flawed.  While it left me touched and I cried, I felt it could have been done better, it seemed to have too much of a Lifetime Movie of the week ending.  All in all it is a beautiful novel, and worth the time spent reading it.
0920668372|5.0|I love my book, thank you for taking such good care of shipping it to me on time.
0316776963|5.0|I first read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" in a writing class.  I must admit that I was skeptical, especially with such an odd sounding title.  I got much more than I bargained for by reading Mr. Sedaris' work.  I was transported to France where I felt like I was struggling like David Sedaris was to learn the language.  I really felt like I was at the amusement park with him when he \\"almost saw this girl get killed\\".  His work is shocking at times, almost always tear inducing funny, and very true to life.  The only thing better than reading his stories, is getting to hear him read the stories.  With his soft spoken voice with a hint of a lisp, you really feel like you are him.  If you get the chance to hear him live, DO SO!  Also, if you are short on time, or do not have the patience level for long novels, this is a good book.  It does not have to be read in order.  It is one of those books that you can pick up read a story,and put it down.
B000P2A24W|3.0|One thing you gotta admit: Bon Jovi is one of those bands that could put out a children's album and it would STILL probably go multi-platinum. Still, critics seemed to have a problem with their last few albums -- well, at least as far back as Bounce, especially considering that their first respective singles after that point all pretty much sounded the same. Now the Jersey boys come back at us with Lost Highway.<br /><br />I thought their last album, Have a Nice Day, was a little weak, but things work out better this time around. One thing I noticed, though, is that for the past few years a few of their songs have been crossing over into country. I don't know if we should be expecting a full-fledged country album from them next time, but if that DOES turn out to be the case, at least they're easing into it (especially considering \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home\\" gave them their biggest hit in a while). Here, one fine example would be the LeAnn Rimes-assisted \\"Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore\\". But the Big & Rich-assisted \\"We Got It Goin' On\\" (although Big & Rich are only doing background vocals) is pretty okay, and it doesn't help that Jon is using dated phrases like \\"shake your money maker\\" (plus, look at the song's very title).<br /><br />But there are still great songs like \\"(You Want to) Make a Memory\\", \\"Whole Lot of Leavin'\\" and the title track. \\"I Love This Town\\" is pretty decent too, but the reason I only gave the album 3-1/2 stars is because a few of the songs start to sound the same after a while. Does Lost Highway rock as hard as New Jersey or Slippery When Wet? Of course not, but it's the best album Jon and the boys made in a while, so you shouldn't be mad that you purchased it.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000ETQPYM|4.0|I will admit I am usually a total cynic and hate romantic novels.  I usually find them trite and uninspired, but with this novel I fell in love with it.  The premis of the novel is sweet.  A young married couple is faced with the fact that they are having to say good-bye to each other as the husband is dying.  Holly, the wife and main character, is totally distraught until she finds out that her hisband has left her a letters with a series of tasks she has to complete.  As she completes the tasks Holly goes through a healing transformation.  Certainly not the best book in the world and far from being deep and thought provoking, the novel is still quite moving and I found myself rooting for Holly and she went through her various adventures.

It's difficult for me to find activities we like to do together and the result is that he's spending too much time alone and with electronics, compounding the situation.<br />I bought this book for him and suggested we sit and read it together.  He loved that and due to the diary/cartoon nature, it was easy to get through together and was full of laughs and real life type funnies.<br />It was great bonding time.

That being said, there are times when I would have preferred they just get to the point and dispense with the cuteness.  Don't let that scare you away however.  You will still learn from this book.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|STARDUST is the brainchild of Neil Gaiman.  His novella of the same name was first brought to illustrated life by Charles Vess.  The novella and the graphic novel enjoyed a lot of commercial success before being brought to life again as a high-concept movie with Robert De Niro, Peter O'Toole, Sir Ian McKellan, and Michelle Pfeiffer in pivotal roles.<br /><br />Comparisons to another cult favorite, THE PRINCESS BRIDE are unavoidable, and I'm going to make them as well.  Both of these movies sing of fantasy and enchantment, and true love and evil.  (Ever notice how those two seem to always go hand-in-hand?)<br /><br />The HD DVD version is spectacular and really brings brilliance of the visual aspect of the movie to home entertainment systems.  The images look like windows to other worlds that you can just reach into.  And it shows how seamless the special effects are.  The colors, especially the magical way they're used in the film, are revealed in stunning array.  The lightning ship looks both absolutely amazing and real at the same time.  This is the way home movies should look.<br /><br />With the uncompressed sound format available on HD DVD, it's no surprise that the audio portion of the movie is outstanding as well.  If you've got even a semi-decent surround sound system at home, you're going to feel as though you're back in the theater watching the movie again (if you watched it there the first time).  All that's missing is the scent of popcorn (unless you're popped some up), and people talking on their cell phones in the background.<br /><br />The story is wonderful and gentle and, at times, scary.  I have to admit that the screenplay done by Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman in some ways outshines the source material.  Gaiman maintained an even-handed fairy tale approach to the story, but Vaughn and Goldman gave the scenes and dialogue to the characters that really allowed the actors and actresses to play them bigger and more meaningful than the prose version.<br /><br />I read the novel in a single sitting, which speaks strongly of it, but I had my breath taken away at times by the movie.  The story of Dunstan Thorne's first foray into forbidden territory and his one night of love with a mysterious woman quickly turned into the delivery of a child nine months later on his doorstep.  With something like that taking place, you know something important is about to take place.<br /><br />But Tristan Thorne had an inelegant life.  No one really liked him and most people made fun of him.  Worst of all, he fell in love with a shallow young girl.  The only thing she did for him was cause him to make a promise that forever changed his life.  When he saw a falling star plunge earthward, he promised her that if she asked, he would go and fetch that star.<br /><br />The viewers knew, though, that the star - even if it had been a comet or asteroid - would have been difficult to find.  Given the fact that the star was actually an immortal being made it even more so.<br /><br />There are a lot of things going on in the movie.  Tristan's promise, the Star's need to find her way back into the heavens, the search of the princes for the ruby that would allow one of them to become King of Stronghold, and the three witches looking for the heart of a star to regain their beauty and youth could all have been spun out into their own stories.  But Gaiman, and the film crew that followed, mixed them all into one exotic blend that provides plenty of adventure and entertainment for the whole family.<br /><br />In addition to the film, there are several special features.  \\"Good Omens\\" (actually a name of a novel written by Gaiman and Terry Pratchett) describes the making of the movie.  Then there are deleted scenes and a blooper reel that is absolutely a laugh riot.<br /><br />If you have the choice between a DVD and an HD DVD, the HD DVD is definitely the way to go.

B00000ICN5|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan's debut, Texas Flood (1983), was so extraordinary, it took everybody in the blues world by surprise when it was released, and it was also nominated for two Grammy Awards. Now, of course, it's no secret how unbelievably and dramatically great Stevie was when playing the guitar and singing the blues. Pride And Joy is the rocking blues that is SRV's most famous song, and it's a pure joy to listen to.<br /><br />Well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind<br />My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine<br />She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy<br /><br />Texas Flood is an insanely good electric guitar blues, and Dirty Pool is a minor-key blues lament of love gone bad.<br /><br />They say that life...Life is a game of give and take<br />I'm telling you one thing right now little baby<br />I won't be the one to pay for your mistake<br /><br />Love Struck Baby is a Stevie Ray Vaughan penned classic, and there's a funky cool version of Mary Had A Little Lamb. The uptempo Rude Mood (nominated for a Grammy Award) and the slow, Hendrix-influenced Lenny are instrumental gems. Texas Flood is a solid album of spirited blues music from one of the greatest and most expressive guitarists of our time.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|When I first heard Wolfmother, I thought, \\"okay, they're not bad.  I can see their influences, which is alright, but not all that original.\\"  But now, about 6 months after purchasing the album, I've found that listening to them is both highly addictive and exhilarating.      For anyone that appreciates good, solid rock 'n roll a la Led Zeppelin, I highly recommend this album/band.  Like LZ, Wolfmother has a knack for creating songs that may at first sound similar, but after a few listens you realize the nuances that make each solo, each song, and in the end the entire band, utterly brilliant.

But still if you are a gamer or a businessman, this is a must have, must read and must memorize.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|This product never came, to this day I don't knowwhat happened to it, or where it was sent to. So I got a refund and ordered another one. The movie was brand new and came right away this time. It is a wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy, there are many funny moments and no slow parts. I would reccomend this movie, however I might want to place the order weeks in advance incase it never gets to you.
B0000025KI|5.0|The River is considered to be, by many, the high point of Bruce Springsteen's popularity. He was a mature artist capable of rocking the house and quieting it, too, with thoughtful ballads like Indepence Day. There may also be the beginnings of a political awareness, but Springsteen was content to lay it between the lines. Point Blank addressed, among other things, the pain of poverty and the one down position of a woman alone in our society. The album is populated by characters the Boss has made classic, Mary is there in The River. Long may he run...
B0000A0DRY|5.0|In 1967, Surrealistic Pillow laid the foundation of psychedelia in America, providing an esoteric, cognitive landscape centered around the hippie climate of yesteryear. With subtle themes that focused upon questioning the status quo and reinforcing counterculture movements throughout the late 1960s, the songs were strongly supported by the talented vocals and instrumentations of the lineup that made up Jefferson Airplane.    Billed oftentimes as the Sergeant Pepper of this side of the Atlantic, Surrealistic Pillow remains a bedrock of how a group could use artistic direction to take the world of music to a whole new playing field. Sure, there were The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, who were perpetually breaking ground, as well as Bob Dylan, who was perhaps the progenitor of protest songs with his one-of-a-kind poetry style and delivery; but Jefferson Airplane are arguably one of the first to use the unorthodox approach of pairing happy sounds with foreboding lyrics and vice versa.    With themes of despair, rebellion and newfound resolve, the songs, instrumentally speaking, are performed very much on par with the Stones' Big Hits: High Tide and Green Grass and Donovan's Greatest Hits but with an American flair to them. Along with vocalist, Marty Balin, is one of the first women at the front of a mostly male band, namely Grace Slick, who dishes out the album's only two Top 10 hits, Somebody to Love and White Rabbit, both of which maintain the overall focus of the duality between mind and heart.    All in all, Surrealistic Pillow is a must have classic. In fact, I am convinced that even if the Beach Boys had released Smile and had it to become America's answer to Sgt.Pepper, as many believed it would have, the San Francisco cultural scene embellished by the Airplane was going to make waves to the extent that Surrealistic Pillow would still be making quite a statement of its own.

B000VR824S|5.0|I attended the concert with my 23 year old daughter and she's a John Mayer fan. Well she was blown away by Jeff Beck and his set. The Beatles song \\"A Day in the life\\" is missing which is too bad as Beck just blew everyone away with that guitar work. Steve Winwood on stage with Clapton and Derek Trucks, Doyle Bramhall, Robert Cray..... all pro's who raised the bar that day. The sound live was suspect but the DVD is awesome and truely captures the highlights of the day except the missing Beck songs.  BB King needs no plugs and his tribute to Eric is classy. Derek Trucks is known by some but this kid can play with some of the strongest riffs all day. Hopefully in the future there will be a more complete DVD of the entire show, but this is a excellent DVD for the money. Just seeing Winwood perform is worth the price.
B000VBP38C|4.0|Very good adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, showing some feminist bias against an original Austin reading (ie. Lizzy telling Jane about Wickham settling for less that ten thousand per year rather then Mr Bennett).    The HD-DVD is well worth having over the regular DVD (I have both). I'd rate the transfer as 90% as some scenes aren't quite perfect.  It did remind my wife as to why we moved from England as the transfer shows the uneven workmanship and daily grime that is so English.    Recommended.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This is the basis of our annual Christmas movie watching, we watch this movie every year and it's one of our favorites.  It's a good family comedy movie that gets everyone in a good mood.  Chevy Chase does an awesome job as the lead character and Randy Quaid as the unwelcome family member is always a great twist.  The Griswalds just want a great all American family Christmas with the entire family present and enjoying each other.  Just one thing after another seems to sabotage that hope in a funny change of events.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|My fiance and I coindentally both watched this film as children so I got it for him for Christmas.  It is an amazing video and both children and adults will love it.  The only big disappointment was that his favorite part of it was David Bowie at the beginning (he was also into The Labyrinth as a boy) and this version is Bowie-less.  Other than that, it was great!
B000E1JOSE|5.0|This is actually the second copy I purchased.  I left the first at a rental while on vacation.  Great price and super product.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie was so wonderful in how it managed to mix our childish views of fantasy and adventure with a slight adult twist, yet all ages are still able to completely appreciate it.  The scene settings were beautiful and all of the wimsicalness was completely enjoyable.  It perfectly played along with its own innocence and even when an aspect of the story was a cliche' it felt invigorated and fresh.  I thoroughly suggest this movie to anyone.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|David Schmader is a genius - he brought this already hilarious movie to a surreal level of intellectualism that I hadn't known was possible. Exquisite!
B00005JKN9|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. The acting is so great in it, especially Daniel Day Lewis as the Butcher. I thought the script, particularly the dialogue, was just amazing. To me, this movie is an absolute masterpiece.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I *heart* both Joaquin and Reese as actors, and this movie did not disappoint. And I was seriously impressed by their stepping up to do all their own singing/playing - the interpretation was, to me, more believable than using actual Johnny/June tracks and lip syncing.
B00005JLWN|5.0|It's an absolute tragedy to me that this movie is not more popular. With a plot based of some of the best pieces of classic literature (1984, Farenheit 451, Brave New World), how could it not be amazing. People said it was a Matrix ripoff to me, but then I actually saw it and realized it was so much better than the Matrix (which I love). The script is pretty much perfect. The special effects aren't perfect, but they still look really nice. The gunfight at the end in particular is amazing. Christian Bale's acting by the way is a pretty subtle example of greatness. Overall, this to me is just one of the most underappreciated movies of all time, and I think it's a real shame.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Our family got this game for Christmas last year, and we all really enjoy it.  My husband and I, our 6 year old and 3 year old all play together.  The 6 year old plays his own pieces, and the 3 year old chooses her pieces and my husband and I take turns placing them.      The plastic shapes are translucent, which is pretty, and there is always an interesting pattern of colors on the board.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna has really grown with this album and you can tell she's had more input and is learning who she really is. There are several great songs on this album, it's not a CD that you love 1-2 songs, there are several good radio-play songs but the others are fun and creative too. Rihanna has a great fairytale story--amazing what she's accomplished in just 3 years, a Cover Girl and six Grammy nominations for this album--sounds like a great year!
B000YABV90|5.0|Not since Forrest Gump Have I cried so much at a movie. Not since Forrest Gump have I left a movie feeling so touched to my very core.<br /><br />\\"August Rush\\" is a sweet, captivating story about an 11-year-old musical prodigy and it showcases the power of his simple but persistent and steadfast faith to make the impossible, POSSIBLE. It's a story that is very well done, very tenderly told and incredibly inspiring and uplifting.<br /><br />The music is wonderful and the acting is all first-rate. As another reviewer said, I'm not one for movie soundtracks, but this is one I plan to order straight away. The 11-year-old musical prodigy (played by Freddie Highmore) is a delightful actor for the part and while I'm one of those people who doesn't really care for flicks with cutesy kids, this movie melted my heart into a puddle of tears.<br /><br />It also provides a keyhole peak at how truly gifted musicians \\"hear\\" and experience the world. Speaking as someone who has struggled and struggled to write a few simple books, it was a pleasure to have an insight on how a true genius views the typically laborious process of creation.<br /><br />The prevailing theme that I took from this movie is this: If we could strip away the many layers of fear, doubt, regret, guilt and all those other dark, burdensome emotions then it'd be easier for us all to find our own \\"Insular tahiti.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"August Rush\\" for anyone who has a heart and I recommend it even more for people who want to see a movie that leaves them with a reassuring hope that sometimes, things really are \\"too good NOT to be true.\\"
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie is surprisingly divisive with regards to audience opinion. I went in with relatively low expectations and came out shocked by how much I loved it. You have to take a chance to watch it but if you do, you'll be rewarded.
0151013047|1.0|The author apparently want to use the American system and American freedoms to demonstrate his distain for both America and Americans, and this fool spent money to buy it.<br /><br />A Pakastani comes to enjoy the privilege of a Princeton education, is fortunate enough to land a lucrative job and is befriended my NY upper crust. All this is never humbly appreciated. Instead the main character is gratified when the planes hit the World Trade Center. He procedes to kick his boss in the teeth by sabotaging an important business assignment and then returns to Pakistan to revel in his self-righteous persecution complex, and perhaps even to become a terrorist.<br /><br />Any American who gives this book a favorable review must not only be blind but stupid too, not knowing what side their bread is buttered on.<br /><br />Frankly both the author and the main character deserve no sympathy. Instead of winning support for his/their cause the author elicits contempt.<br /><br />If foreigners don't like American policy or American people the solution is simple enough: STAY HOME. Don't enjoy our freedom, our prosperity, our education system,  and -thank God so far- our peaceful way of life.<br /><br />The author is upset that the USA didn't pressure India -----well I suppose had the USA pressed Pakistan Pakistan would be upset and if the US pressured India then the Indians would be upset. Even governments can't please all the people all the time. The US government's role to  protect US interests. That's why they make the big bucks. Right? Unlike islamic governments who make the big bucks (royal family, sadamm's sones, etc.) while the bulk of their citizenry live in poverty.<br /><br />Two glaring omissions: the author failured to attribute any wrongdoing to any islamic governments (Hey Hamid do you know Jews are banned from Saudi Arabia, do think Iran should wipe Israel off the map?) and the author failed to address the hideousness of islam itself (women are less than cattle).<br /><br />I, for one, am exhuated by these hypocrytical ingrates who exploit our country while hoping or working for its demise.<br />Are you American?

B0001Z37HM|4.0|This is a great movie which I used to introduce my younger sister to the world of fantasy. Guys, seriously... if your women don't care for the action/adventure movies, find movies with female leads. As I titled this review, I would almost consider this Conan 3, It's got Arnold Schwarzenegger swinging his sword again and with the hotness of Brigitte Nielsen in a skimpy leather outfit. Those who enjoy Xeena would probably also enjoy this.<br /><br />My reasons behind not giving this 5 stars would be that it's NOT Conan, it's just Arnold playing a very very similar role and the attempt at comic relief of \\"fat guy & annoying brat\\" really wasn't funny, it was just annoying.<br /><br />I didn't notice any damage in the product and the packaging is typical for a single disc DVD, nothing fancy.
0743277457|5.0|As an educator and Myers Briggs NT type, I found this book to be inspirational and insightful as it reinforced many of my own experiences with learning and teaching. Josh weaves the concepts together with his personal story in a very engaging manner. The stories illustrate the application of the learning principles quite well, in my opinion. The concepts are defined enough for my taste, while being flexible/loose enough for application to other fields of endeavor. I wish perhaps that he had spent more time talking about the hard work of showing up every day, but most people probably won't find that of interest since it's the peaks we all like to celebrate. And anyway, he does frequently reference the fact that it took an extreme commitment on his (and his partners') part to achieve his results.    Book-learners would probably profit greatly from the application of the principles in this book. I'm not so sure I could say whether other learning modes would benefit  directly although I think the principles would still be present in some form or another.     On another level, Josh's book made me think a lot about how I reacted to situations in life where I expected more ethical/moral/considerate/professional/courteous behavior from others. And then I thought more about those times I was the, well-jerk...    Highly recommended for those who love to experience beyond the superficial.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I hated to see Seinfeld go. Unfortunately I did not watch the series when it was running. But after viewing the first DVD I enjoyed the show immensely. At least I can say I've collected all seasons now. The last season #9 is the best!!!
0765348276|4.0|This was a good read- definitely worth buying if you're an old Heinlein fan.  As other reviewers have no doubt mentioned, this book is very much a modern version of Starship Troopers.  Lots of fancy, interesting tech and some interesting futuristic infantry/military stuff.    It does have some shortcomings.  The hero seems even more wide-eyed and innocent Jonny from the original book (mainly as he's supposedly 75 years old but really doesn't act it).  Space warfare is very primitive (low-speed kinetic weapons seem to be cutting edge) and the society painted is a bit two-dimensional.  But if you're looking for an easy, engaging read rather than cerebral social or sci-fi exploration (that'd be Banks and Reynolds), this is a great choice.
B0001KZM3O|2.0|I was just out of college when this album came out in the early eighties.  Everyone I knew tried to like it. (Right out of college everyone's broke so no one wants to give in to buyer's remorse.)  I still put it on from time to time to see if my opinion has changed and have bought it multiple times including the 2004 remaster.  It's really a 2.5 star album.  Musically and melody-wise it's subpar, and lyrically it's even worse.  But it's still of interest because of Roger's backing group which includes some of the members of Pink Floyd (who can't stand the album).<br /><br />Compared to the other Pink Floyd releases, even the soundtrack lp's \\"More\\" and \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" are much more interesting.  However, this one's really a Roger Waters solo album and, as such, it's the best of those.<br /><br />The problem is that Waters' solo albums are, ahem, not exactly great.<br /><br />There are some people, however, who enjoy famous rock stars throwing left wing temper tantrums. If you like that sort of thing, as Rolling Stone magazine does, then this would be your cup of tea.
B00013F38K|5.0|I was excited to buy this set when it came out some time back.  Kung Fu was a favorite show from my past.  Sure, Bruce Lee could take David Caradine any day, and the martial arts are more dance than warfare, but the storyline and the philosophical thread of \\"tranquility over violence\\", \\"good over evil\\" still plays well and I felt good about showing the episodes to my 10 year old son.  If you were a fan of the show \\"back then\\" you will enjoy watching the episodes again. Cameos of not yet stars are found (10 year old Jodie Foster)   Now if we can just get David Carradine to stop doing the \\"Yellow Book\\" commercials the world might again find order.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This was an excellently produced historical film - accurate and very visually appealing.  I heartily recommend it.
B000UJBYD8|5.0|The Cult have returned in 2007 with their best effort since Sonic Temple. The band sounds great and the production is very cool and raw. Ian Astbury, Billy Duffy and co. retain the trademark Cult sound on this effort without sounding dated at all. If you have ever been a fan of The Cult do yourself a huge favor and pick this one up.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Simply the best.  Excellent portrayal of the characters.  I've watched it so many times but I'm still taken by it especially the early morning scene in the end with Darcy and Elizabeth.  Breath taking!
B00030590I|5.0|There's not much that I can really add to what's already been said- however, there is one thing that I do want to say...There is a wonderful theme that runs through stories like Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and Crouching Tiger.  That theme is realization.  Specifically, the realization that sometimes making a sacrifice for an ideal is the only possible thing to do.  In Hero, there are many sacrifices, and many ideals.  The final realization of the Hero, though, is that his sacrifice will lead to a better world for his people, the people that will finally come together in- \\"Our Land\\".
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|This is a nice boxed set with a lot of extra features, which is the reason I bought it.  But there is a lack of subtitles (English/Spanish) which are present in previous series.  A flaw that to many boxed sets have.  It cannot be THAT hard to put them in.    On the other hand, the series are great, Gibbs is getting a little more personal, McGee is gaining self confidence and DiNozzo falls in love....So many interesting things.  I like to have a B story, a continuous storyline though out the season and even between series.  A good buy, if your hearing and understanding of English is good.
B000Q6GXW2|1.0|I got this one free with my Toshiba HD DVD player and it's still not worth it. What a shame. Another chance to produce an interesting period film and it's wasted. This one performs only for the eyes with no intention of hitting the brain. While watching this drivel, I could only think, I don't care about any of these people? None of them are even the slightest bit likable either. They all act exactly same. All posturing, \\"I'm bad, I'm hardcore, don't mess with me, bring it on\\",blah blah blah. One of the Spartans supposedly can't wait for the day when he meets someone who can kill him so he can have a \\"glorious death\\". Yeah right,I'm sure that's exactly what people said back then. The dialog had me rolling my eyes so much, they just about rolled out of my head.<br />Then there are all these people and monsters that you have no idea what they are. EX:A guy with saws in place of his arms? And let's not forget about the nudity. It serves no meaning or purpose and it's there only to get the viewer aroused.<br /><br />Let me sum up this movie in it's own fashion. One of the famous lines that you probably saw on the preview was \\"Spartans, prepare for glory\\".<br />I say, \\"Potential viewers, prepare for yelling, and many long winded speeches, and lame poetic talking, and slow motion on every single battle scene\\".<br /><br />As I said, what a waste. Like Troy and Beowulf, here was the opportunity to create a solid movie on an interesting story. But like the others, they got caught up in showing skin, excessive violence, lame dialog and characters you could'nt care less for.
B000060MWU|5.0|David Lynch explores the boundary between the internal world and the real in evocative, engaging and atmospheric style. thisis one of Lynch's most approachable movies - on the level of Mulholland Drive and a little more complex than Blue Velvet.<br /><br />Evil - so authentically personified by Robert Blake (last seen on trial for a real-world murder) - is resident in the heart and mind of a saxophonist brilliantly played by Bill Pullman (who was \\"Lone Star\\" in Spaceballs) and Patricia Arquette (last seen as the popular television series \\"Medium.\\") Robert Loggia is the gangster. Here their talents are not wasted, and neither is one minute of film. There are also some other actors. As always with Lynch there is brilliant humor if you appreciate his type of humor. Most memorably, the instructional driving lesson administered by the gangster Robert Loggia. The plot is simple like most Lynch plots once you understand that things experienced are not necessarily real. As a Lynch-O-phile I deciphered this one on first viewing, which doesnt mean that there are not remaining puzzles. The real point is to be carried by the tides of a story told with both emotional and intellectual clarity, and with a relentless momentum leading to a really terrifying collision of worlds real and unreal.<br /><br />Skip the last paragraph if you prefer to figure things out your own way.<br /><br />**<br />The saxophonist marries a former porn star. He recoils at sex with her, a problem amplified by jealousy when he sees her with a former friend/lover. Evil, personified by Blake, is invited into the house. Brutal murder, arrest,conviction and retreat into delusion (Lost Highway) and the delusional persona of young auto mechanic Eddy follow. However, the veil of delusion is pierced first by recollection of his own music, then by the reappearance of his murdered wife as gangster's moll. More things happen...<br /><br />****
0743486285|3.0|Okay, maybe it's not exactly fair to compare The Heroin Diaries to The Dirt (the Crue's collective autobiography), but it's a natural comparison, as A) the majority of those reading this book will have read The Dirt, and B) the author wouldn't have even thought of trying to publish this if not for the success of the Crue's chronicles.  There are plenty more tales of debauchery in these so-called \\"diaries\\" (and come on, does anyone actually believe he was keeping a diary? I don't think so.), but there is also a lot of dull repetition regarding the the author's heroin use and withdrawals, and tons more nobody-loves-me crap about his childhood.  If you've seen him promoting this book, he says he published these \\"diaries\\" in hopes of helping others to avoid the hell that he went through.  Give me a break!  Having read this, I can assure you he glamorizes his drug abuse throughout and is quite proud of the depravity of his former lifestyle (that's right--he reminds us once again that he \\"died\\" twice--just in case we forgot).  I recommend instead dusting off your Crue albums and reading (or re-reading) The Dirt--it's a lot more fun.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Here he is again, National Lampoon Chevy Chase.  It would have been funnier without the language though.  His cousin Eddie puts the icing on the cake when he shows up with his family and \\"puppy\\".  Chevy's family reminds me of mine and probably most of America.  I'm sure most everyone has had an Aunt Bethany.  Of all the National Lampoon Vacations, I loved the Christmas one the most.  Go Chevy......

B0000CD5FN|5.0|Seldom does a performer have as much to say as the amazing Joe Strummer. His last album is as good and powerful as any Clash release. Not quite the same as the Clash but thats what makes it so good. He followed his own path and did things his own way and the resulting career stands up to the test of time and the final words are a fitting and masterful conclusion. All of the songs are great but his Ode to Johhny Cash, \\"Long Shadow\\" could also be a tale of his own great legacy. The greats always leave us too early but Streetcore is amazing and should be in everyones collection!!
1591391105|4.0|As a keen student of new manager behaviour always on the lookout for new ideas, I picked up \\"The First 90 Days\\" with great anticipation.  Michael Watkins sets out to provide new managers (he calls them \\"leaders\\") with a 90 day plan for taking over in a new role.  There's lots to recommend this book.  There's also lots to question.<br /><br />In \\"The First 90 Days\\", the author stresses the importance of building momentum during the critical transition phase from new manager to successful manager.  A 90 day acceleration plan is suggested that includes 10 transition challenges ranging from \\"promote yourself\\" through \\"score early wins\\", to \\"expedite everyone\\".  One needs to look further than the title of these challenges as they are often more than what they seem.  For example, \\"promote yourself\\" has more to do with changing your perspective to fit the new role rather than self-promotion.<br /><br />I particularly liked some of the practical tips included in this book, such as the \\"Problem Preferences Assessment\\" which enables the new manager to quickly select the most appropriate and rewarding problem areas to address.  Also a suggestion to write yourself a letter as if you had been in the role for three years describing what others said about your success in the role, is a nice way to set a broad vision for the new manager.  Chapter 5 \\"Negotiate Success\\", which is all about managing your boss through the 90 day plan, is worth the price of this book alone.<br /><br />I have three areas of criticism.  Firstly, whilst the book has a fantastic array of suggestions, strategies, tips etc, I feel it would take more than 90 days to implement them all, let alone do the work that is required in the role.  As such, it would make a great text for students of management, but could overwhelm the new manager looking for some quick or directed advice.<br /><br />Secondly, although the author stresses otherwise, the book seems more suited to upper level roles than first line supervisors.  For example, Chapter 6 \\"Achieve Alignment\\", looks at quite a sophisticated process of crafting strategy, assessing coherence, assessing adequacy and modifying strategy.<br /><br />Finally, I'd like to see more positive case studies to illustrate rather than the \\"what went wrong\\" scenarios provided in a number of chapters.  Although in real life, we often learn more from our mistakes, in a teaching role (such as this book) it is far more effective for the reader if he or she can see what works and implement this, rather than what doesn't.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as an excellent text for management students and a resource for management teachers/educators.  If you're a  reading \\"The First 90 Days\\", then go straight to the practical \\"How to\\" areas, otherwise your 90 days will be up before you finish reading.

B000ZLFALI|4.0|I loved it.  I can't wait to get the DVD.  I listen to the soundtrack over and over again.  I know the acting is a bit amateurish, the plot is to simple and cliched, and the movie really adds nothing new to the story of a child of WASP privilege awakening to new ideas and political activism.  BUT... I still loved the movie, saw it twice, and was incredibly happy each time.  I was born in 1963, so I was too young to experience the 60's, but I think this movie was a good way for my 17 yearl-old daughter to get some idea of what they were all about.  I've been awakened to the music of the Beatles in a way I never was before, at the ripe age of 44. Julie Taymor does a great job with the visuals and I like the new interpretations of the songs.  I've even set up a playlist for my iPod with the Beatles versions juxtaposed with the soundtrack, which makes for an interesting listening experience.<br /><br />If you liked FRIDA, enjoy a very visual and artistic approach to a movie, and don't consider the Beatles' music so sacred that no one should ever cover the songs, you will probably enjoy this movie.
B000002J09|5.0|From the minute you put this CD in you are blown away by the greatness of Led Zeppelin. Black Dog is such an amazing opening song with Jimmy Page playing crazily. Rock and Roll is an amazing feat by John Bonham on drums. The Battle of Evermore is one of Zepp's most underrated songs. Then of course there's Stairway to Heaven. Possibly the greatest song ever written, it shows how creative Led Zeppelin really was. The guitar solo for Stairway is easily the greatest ever. So if you want an amazing CD I recommend Led Zeppelin IV.
B000001ELL|2.0|With the 1979 release of Dynasty KISS has become a shell of their former selves and is starting to reveal the effects of what a burst of success can exact on four guys who were willing to do anything to make it. Soliciting the help of Vini Poncia, it was obvious KISS wanted to sell records to mainstream America. The departure from the traditional sound, however, duly rendered this record the beginning of the end. KISS was doomed from the concept of the solo records and Dynasty underscored this fact.    From Stanley's dance-inspired and ill-conceived \\"I was Made For Lovin' You\\" to Simmons awful \\"X-Ray Eyes\\", this record was an embarrassment to those of us waiting for another raw studio effort. Poncia's influence was not understated and Simmons and Stanley phoned this one in, perhaps they had tired of the grind and expectation. Frehley is the only bright spot, though his awkward vocal takes some getting use to. \\"Hard Times\\" is unmistakable KISS - not terribly well-written, but raunchy guitars, intresting drums and a solid solo performance help.     As a drummer who started out by mimicking everything Peter Criss did, it's obvious Pete did not play a whole lot on this record - or, for that matter, the studio offerings on the ALIVE II record. Pete was having a bit of trouble staying sober, as was Ace - the band was in turmoil and Dynasty was the residual effect of four guys who were not happy with each other.     KISS would not again capture the magic in the studio and the tour that followed Dynasty suffered - many empty seats proved that the gents had overstayed their welcome. I was the ripe old age of fifteen when this record was released and it was becoming increasingly difficult to counter KISS detractors (KISS SUCKS!) - my hope was that the follow-up to Dynasty would prove that KISS had hit a bump in the road - they would once again rise and deliver. Imagine my disappointment.....    Peace
0307387151|1.0|Rigourously postmodern and pessimistic, McEwan's hit is not much more than self-indulgent meta-fiction, with overly self-conscious use of floating third point of view. No grace within these pages.  Boring and transparent.
0440238609|4.0|Before the movie came out, I have to say I was sadly unaware of the existence of Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. And had there not been so much controversy stirred up over the movie, I probably never would have picked up the books anyway. So I have to give the religious right a hearty thank-you for turning me onto such a wonderful story I would have otherwise missed.<br /><br />This trilogy focuses on Lyra, a young girl who we learn early on is prophesized to do great things. An `orphan,' she was brought up by Scholars at Jordan College in England. Lyra's world is an alternate version of our own, so while there is an England, there are also places that don't exist on the earth we know. She and everyone else also has a \\"daemon\\"--an animal personification of their \\"spirit\\" that everyone can see and even talk to. As children, daemons can take any shape they please, but once you reach puberty, your daemon will take on the permanent shape of the animal that personifies your spirit. So, (as one book explains) if you're a loyal person who willingly follows orders, your daemon will probably be a dog.<br /><br />Lyra starts on her adventure when she and her daemon, Pan, hide in a closet and see the Master of Jordan College try to poison her Uncle Asriel (her guardian who left her at the college), who is visiting after an expedition from the North. After saving him from being poisoned, Lyra watches from the closet as Asriel shows the heads of Jordan College pictures he took of a mysterious substance called \\"Dust\\" that seems to fall from the sky and settle on adults, but not children.<br /><br />At the same time, children are disappearing all over England, and rumors abound about \\"Gobblers\\" who are stealing the kids to \\"eat\\" them. Right after Lyra's friend, Roger, goes missing, she leaves Jordan College with a mysterious and powerful woman named Mrs. Coulter, whom she later discovers is one of the Gobblers. With the help of the alethiometer (the \\"golden compass\\", given to her by none other than the same Master of Jordan who tried to poison her uncle), which tells the truth if you ask it a question, she heads for the North to save Roger and find her uncle, whom she learned is now being imprisoned by the armored bears in the North. There she learns what the Gobblers have really been doing to the missing children, and what Dust really is.<br /><br />I can't really summarize the later two books without giving away huge spoilers, so I suppose I'll leave it there.<br /><br />Anyway, I appreciate when authors make their protagonists (and villains) believable, by creating characters who have realistic flaws, positive attributes and believable motivations. Since HDM is a \\"children's\\" trilogy series, that's especially refreshing, as you often find literature geared toward kids with ridiculously virtuous heroes and ridiculously stupid and pointlessly evil villains. Lyra is no where near a \\"perfect\\" person. She's headstrong, rebellious, impolite and impulsive (and, not to mention, a chronic liar). But she's also loving, loyal, strong and virtuous. If I had a daughter, I would want her to be like Lyra. Mrs. Coulter, as one example of a villain, is beautifully done. She is easily despised, and yet, not everything she does is despicable.<br /><br />I'm sad that there are parents out there who would deny their children the experience of reading this series merely because of its religious allegory storyline. This isn't a series about \\"killing god\\" or \\"defiling Christianity.\\" It's a story that elevates love, logic and reason over hate, fear and tyranny. Yes, the Church is portrayed as \\"evil.\\" Yes, \\"God\\" is portrayed as a tyrant. But it is a fictional story set in a fictional world, and you could simply explain to your children that the Church portrayed in the series is not the same as the one in the real world, and that the themes of beauty and love are the important messages to take from it. And if your children have true \\"faith\\" in their religion,one good story isn't going to sway them from that. There is so much spirituality to these books, and appreciation for the world and beauty around us. It shows how even an atheist can believe in the connection between all living things, and a spirit and a soul.<br /><br />My one criticism comes for the end of the series. Unfortunately, I can't really go into detail because I would be giving away the end of the book, but I just felt there were some easily avoided plot holes near the end. Don't, however, let that deter you from finishing the books. It was a wonderful story that I look forward to letting my kids read one day.m that.

0345494997|2.0|seems to be the mantra of Mamah Borthwick, linguist, intellectual, translator, wife, mother of two, and mistress of Frank Lloyd Wright. The author created this work of fiction by piecing together historical facts from newspaper articles, the writings of Mr. Wright (on architecture), and of Ms. Borthwick (translations of Swedish feminist Ellen Key's works) as well as the content of ten letters written by Borthwick to Key. Although there is little to complain about in the writing save a few clich&eacute;s: Maymah's thoughts about Frank (p 25), \\"I am putty in your hands, so quickly,\\" feelings about him (p 34), \\"She loved him with every cell in her body,\\" and Frank's words to her (p 128), \\"You make me want to be a better man,\\" Maymah's thoughts and actions are so self-centered and self-serving that this book reads like one long lesson on the consequences of a life selfishly-lived. In one of few moments of clarity, she wonders how she has become so accepting of her own improper behavior considering (p 32), \\"She had always thought herself a deeply moral person,\\" yet agrees with a passage of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's (p 33), \\"It is not sufficient to be a mother; an oyster can be a mother.\\" Her disdain for motherhood comes in spite of the fact that her children are cared for by a nanny, so much so that when her daughter becomes sick during a train trip, she thinks (p 58) \\"What would Louise do?\\" The book jacket states that she is \\"forced to choose between the roles of a mother, wife, lover and intellectual.\\" She chooses the roles of lover and intellectual, and abandons her three-year-old daughter and almost seven-year-old son at a friend's house with whom they've been visiting, to be with Wright, telling the children (p 83), \\"I'm going on a small vacation...One just for me.\\" The children don't see their mother again for two years. She ponders explaining her choice to her children as (p 140) \\"not...a cruel self-indulgence\\" but \\"an act of love for life\\" and believes that the kids might end up \\"...better off, with four happy parents.\\" Late in the novel after a fight with Wright, she tells him (p 302), \\"The children are what matters now.\\" Yeah, right. What transpires during the children's next visit to Mamah's and Frank's home, Taliesin, may never had happened had she made different choices.

I had been watching the DVD for the past year and a half, which was very helpful. Then someone loaned me a copy of this audio book and WOW! All the little missing pieces were filled in. In the past couple of weeks of listening and applying the teachings of this book I have had amazing changes in my life. Understanding this information makes every day a magnificent journey.
B0000C23DO|5.0|I am not a \\"Dead Head\\" but I like the music. This alblum has most of my favorite Grateful Dead songs and the recordings are excellent.<br />  I might point out that these are mostly studio recordings, there is only one live track. The Grateful Dead's music in a studio (like most groups) has a different feel than live music. Some would even say that they are different songs when done live.<br />  If you are not a \\"Dead head\\" I would still recommend this CD. Then, I might recommend listeniong to the same songs on live alblums.<br />  On another note, there are a lot of emotions flying around about the band and the times. As a teenager, I was caught between waring factions of the social and political arena. The Grateful Dead's music has drug and lifestyle references of the times. But, being a forty five year old guy (who actually is balding and fighting a losing battle with a growing gut), I look at the emotional experience with the music as a glimpse at history and not an endorsement for a lifestyle that we gave up thirty five or so years before.<br />  Good tunes, though, and not terribly expensive.

055314300X|3.0|So I read this on a whim, seeing the book for sale for $1 at a thrift store. Remembering that I enjoyed the movie a long time ago, I figured the read would be pretty good. Turned out the book is simply ok, with more than a few parts really strecthing to make the story continue to flow. The connection to Les Classiques, the general, and the final scene were choppy to say the least. What started out as a very strong premise turned out to be medicore. So much time was spent in Bourne's head that I thought of Spiderman's catch phrase (\\"With great power...\\"). Now I have the \\"Cain is...\\" stuck in my head. Really overdone.    Book was ok, would recommend for a quick read.

0719561027|4.0|There is no need to be outraged, insulted, shocked, or even disappointed after finding out that many, if not all, instances in this book didn't really happen. An autobiography can never be true...any instance in one's life that they attempt to reflect back on is biased. How Frey invisioned his life is personal to him. He will always see instances, people, places, and events differently than an outsider looking in would. Can we ever be truthful when speaking about who we are or what we've been through? No...because our lives, as we choose to describe them, are snapshots of what our brains choose to remember. An autobiography is what the author thinks about his or her own life. It doesn't matter what really happened...nobody could ever see Frey's life experiences the way he does. So take this work for what it is...a person's take on their own life...how they see it...how they want to portray it. An autobiography can never be true to every person...it can only be true to the person who writes it.
B00005JPTI|5.0|I have read several stories by Richard Matheson but not I Am Legend, so I do not have any expectations but I can unequivocally say that a book can never be transitioned to the screen as written; telling a visual story is far different from developing a story on the printed page.  For my wife and me I Am Legend is a terrific thriller that does not let up.  Will Smith gives an excellent performance as Robert Neville who decides to remain behind as Manhattan is cut off from the rest of the world to battle a man-made virus. The emotion level that he reaches in his portrayal beautifully conveys the commitment of his character to find a cure that will save those infected by the virus.  His relationship and devotion to Sam the German Shepard is a joy to watch and becomes distressing for us when Sam succumbs to the virus.      Although other reviewers found the film slow I liked the pacing.  First we learn what it is like being the last human on Manhattan by observing Robert Neville performing his everyday chores and activities. We get to know him.  Flashbacks tell the story of Neville's family and their escape from New York into the supposedly safe are beyond.   He has been on his own, alone except for Sam, for three years, and it is the emotional toll, his desperation for someone to talk with, that Will Smith makes so convincing.   He does not meet another human being until the last quarter of the film when Anna saves him from the infected.  When he finally meets Anna, Neville finds it a bit hard to communicate right away and finds her optimism that anyone has survived to be doubtful.     The supporting cast includes Will Smith's daughter, Willow, and Salli Richardson as Neville's wife, very brief but nicely played roles.  Although I have seen several virus/zombie films like 28 Days Later and the Dead series by Romero I did find the creatures in this film rather creepy.  The scene where Sam follows a deer into a building held a lot of suspense for me.  The creatures do look a bit unreal sometimes and I took them all to be CGI generated until I learned that someone actually played the \\"Alpha-Male\\" that attempts to capture Neville.  There are some things about the film that do stretch the imagination a little.  My wife was wondering how destroying the bridges into Manhattan would stop people from getting off the island: couldn't someone build a raft or simply swim.  Was Anna on Manhattan the entire time or did she travel to the island?  There are a few questions like this that are not essential to the story but make one wonder, and require a book to answer all of the sub-plots.      I Am Legend is a film that requires more than one viewing to take in marvelous design of a New York being taken over by nature and I think one would be better able to see all of the facets in Will Smith's performance.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I liked this movie. Not really a movie that I would buy but that's OK. It was an interesting idea that the director put together fairly well.  The only complaint I have is that the movie was so confusing from the very beginning. In fact, it was so confusing that it distracted from the story line and the plot. The second time I watched it was better for me because I knew what was coming.  The thing that made the entire movie was Robert De Niro playing a cross-dressing pirate. It was so out of character for him that you just couldn't help loving him, even with his girly-man thing going on.  Well, with all of that said there is just one more thing to say. I would rent it first. Don't buy it so you'll be disappointed and then learn to hate it. It's better to rent it, love it and then buy it, rather than buy it, be disappointed and hate it.
B00005JPTI|4.0|What happens when in modern times, a revolutionary, almost too-good-to-be-true solution to a life threatening, scary problem appears and seems to be the cure for everything that goes wrong? As if someone walked up to you one day and said \\"Oh, hi, here's a magical box that if you keep it with you all the time, you will never be sick, never have problems, and have a long lasting life.\\" Would you still feel the same about your life and the people in it? And would you rely on this so much...that it would destroy you? What if that solution was the cure for cancer? \\"I Am Legend\\" is a fascinating, new post-apocalyptic thriller starring veteran actor Will Smith. When the cure for cancer is brought upon humanity, and the drug is administered to patients, hell breaks loose. A virus is created, that starts as side effects to the drug. One day in New York, the virus mutates and ends infecting everyone on the planet, with a 90% kill rate. The virus takes these people and transforms them into possessive zombie-like creatures that are deathly afraid of the light and come out at night to hunt for survivors of the virus.    Robert Neville, a brilliant scientist, is apparently the only survivor of this pandemic, being somehow completely immune to the mutated virus. He lives alone with his dog Samantha who is also immune to the air-borne strain of the virus only in New York City, which has been completely deserted. He sends out radio signals to search for other survivors while trying to maintain his sanity and test samples of the virus in his lab he has in his basement. Everything seems OK for him, from strolling the disturbingly empty, weed-ridden streets of Manhattan, driving golf balls from rooftops, and taking unrestricted tours of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.    Until the night comes. At his watch's beep, Neville bolts himself into his house to protect him and Samantha from what's out there--the remaining 90% of the world's population who want to infect Neville and Samantha. He mustn't be seen in the darkness to avoid the zombie/human creatures who watch his every move, waiting for him to slip up. As if this wasn't enough, Neville is plagued with dreams of the final moments of human civilization, when the aggressive decision is made to quarantine New York City, and the horrific death of his wife and daughter.    I know what you're thinking--that I Am Legend sounds like a corny, cheesy, over-used, washed up, unoriginal B-movie Hollywood pile of crap. I can assure you, it is far from that. The film is scientifically fascinating (even from a person who despises the thought of science class) and is like a window onto our own current society that where we're headed, trying to fix everything, can end in horrific situations. The images of post-day New York are extremely disturbing and horrifying, especially if you're familiar with the city as I am, from living in its metro area. Images of a blowing, dusty Times Square, complete with its usual screens and advertisements, except with cracks in the street, weeds growing out, and no people--something that anyone who's ever been to New York will tell you is simply impossible.    The movie seems to be two-faced. There is a dire, extremely thought provoking sense of caution and tensity throughout the film, even in the calm scenes, that inspires otherworldly levels of suspense. You can do anything you like in the Big Apple that is now 100% deserted--except go out at night. This makes the film both extremely entertaining, very fascinating to watch, and utterly terrifying.    Apart from all of that, \\"I Am Legend\\" is the scariest film I've seen all year. By far. And it's not everyday a PG-13 receives that reward. Not only the premise of being totally alone in a disturbingly deserted huge city that used to be home to over eight million, but in other ways as well. Unlike other zombie movies, which may you leave you laughing, \\"I Am Legend\\" has got the stuff to leave you shielding your eyes and shaking in fear. I know it had me scared out of my mind. Some of the scenes are extremely intense, grotesque, and the movie is jam-packed with utterly horrifying jump scenes that had my completely packed theater jumping out of their seats (and no, it wasn't just me). I could say that this movie is scarier than all four \\"Saw\\" films combined. Therefore--unless you can take a very scary movie, it might be a good idea to pass this one up. I feel sorry for those who saw it in IMAX. But if you can take the horror, get your tickets. If one movie this season deserves your ticket money, make it \\"Legend.\\" The film is extremely well crafted and executed. Francis Lawrence delivers incredibly good direction and the editing is very well done, with horrifying flashbacks to a panicked New York, and makes the film that much more fascinating to watch. There is a strange sense of realism in the movie, something that'll make you think, \\"Could this be where we're headed?\\" Not in the sense of zombies, of course, but in other disasters. The only complaints I have with this film is the ending was much less than satisfactory, and in my taste, was a bit too clichéd. The second half of the film is still very good, but fails to deliver the tensity, horror, and strange fascination that the first half brings.    So, if you're looking for a way out of a bunch of dumb laughable zombie movies, and searching for one that actually scares the crap out of you, check out \\"I Am Legend.\\" You may find yourself pleasantly surprised.

Data analysis of lifestyle and diet *in a homogenous gene pool (e.g. Chinese people)\\" can possibly lead to some interesting conclusions, but it is foolish to suggest that those conclusions will apply to any single *other* ethnic group, let alone *every other* ethnic group in the world.     If you are caucasian, black, hispanic, west indian, samoan, japanese, or anything else for that matter, reading this book is a waste of your time.
B000AMWIVM|2.0|I expected to be entertained, frightened, and disturbed by this film.    Instead, I was bored, disappointed, and disgusted.    You can get better violence in any action movie; you can get a better psychological thrill from 'Silence of the Lambs' or even a cheesy sci-fi like 'Event Horizon'; you get more plausibility out of 'Lord of the Rings'. At least Lord of the Rings doesn't pretend to be reality.    In 'Saw', the film's apparently omiscient, omnipotent, and short sightedly self-righteous 'Jigsaw Killer' sets ridiculously contrived and unnecessary traps for his victims. That's pretty much it. Maybe he's a surviving henchman from some old Bond film?     There are a dozen points in the movie when an intelligent person says, \\"Wait, why would they do that?\\" and the movie loses all its plausibility. The characters act and interact in ways that only the most unintelligent and illogical people would; in order for the plot to progress as it does, the screenwriters throw one deus ex machina after another at you.    I can only take so many absurd twists and revelations before realizing that I got swindled. If you were thrilled by this idiotic film... kudos, I'm glad you don't feel gypped. That makes one of us, at least.

B00006YXEK|5.0|During the time that much of the music on this recording was created, George, was very aware that his life was almost over. And going in, I had never heard a note of this CD entitled: \\"Brainwashed\\". As, I could only imagine what he was dealing with in the last year of his life, I was expecting the music of this disc to be dire and depressed in content. These great up-lifting songs and the general tone of happiness that I found here were such a great and incredible surprise! This CD has really re-inforced the commitment of George Harrison as a man of great faith and vast spirit. And because of this, my respect for this man and his art has multiplied.<br /><br />From the wonderful acoustic guitars that ring like bells on the opener: \\"Any Road\\", right on through to the closer: \\"Brainwashed\\" this is joyful music that ranks up with the best of George's greatest works. In line with the album: \\"Cloud Nine\\" and the best moments of The Wilbury's, these are the sounds of a mature and worldly person, that seems very content and at peace.<br /><br />On repeated listenings this record holds up so well that my favorite track keeps on changing. Right now: \\"Pisces Fish\\" is at the top, but this is an ongoing thing for my ears and heart, so I'll bet another of these gems takes it's place as I absorb this record again and again.<br /><br />I will agree with some of the other reviewers and say that as the DVD is beautiful in content, and gives us a real personal look at George, {who was sooo private about his life} I sure do wish it was longer. That said, I really think that this the Deluxe Edition is the way to go, it is special and fitting for this record to have all the extras included.<br /><br />It's still difficult to be without George Harrison in our world, but his spirit is so vast, he is now the universe above us forever.<br />This is a Fantasic CD!<br />FIVE STARS !!!

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace was a superb depiction of one man's over 30 year struggle to end the British Empire's lucrative slave trade. William Wilberforce was a young man who came to his own understanding of the immorality of the ongoing practice of enslaving other people. He was raised in a rich trade family, and had no need to work himself. He was exposed to the best of everything; the best food, the best clothes, opportunities for schooling including Oxford, continual parties and entertainment. Yet in the midst of growing up, he was exposed by a Methodist uncle and aunt to the great religious speakers (and practitioners) of that faith. Wilberforce came to the realization of the need to devote his life to something good. His friends including William Pitt Jr. encouraged him to spend his life in Parliament fighting for a cause, rather than retiring his place in Parliament to become a preacher or a religious hermit. Wilberforce had always been a kind young man who hated to see the mistreatment of animals and other human beings of all classes, so when his friends showed him the ugly side of the British Empire's wealth, that was based on the enslavement of people from Africa who were then sent to the Americas, he quickly chose to devote his life and time to ending this horrific trade.     This movie eloquently demonstrates not only the many obstacles Wilberforce had to contend with, but also the length of time it took him to achieve his goal...the passage of a bill that made the trade of shipping slaves illegal in Great Britain. Thirty years of work by Wilberforce and those who work with him took its toll on his health. This movie above all is a testament to the need to endure to the end that this great man demonstrated so well.     I had read the book on this man, and wanted to see the movie. My husband had not been interested in this though I had told him about this man and his great efforts. During the course of the movie, my husband went from paying attention to his photography work, to paying attention to the movie. Afterwards he exclaimed that this was one of the best historial dramas he had ever seen. This from a man who prefers Dirty Harry movies and war movies. The acting was impeccable as always from known British actors, many of who performed in small but great support roles. Iaon Gruffudd, who most Americans know from the commercial 'Fantastic Four' series, was outstanding as Wilberforce.    Don't think that a historical drama has to be dry and boring. This one is anything but. For one thing, Wilberforce was known to be one of the best, if not the best, political speaker of his time. His eloquence on the floor of Parliament and in his own writings, made him required reading over here in the U.S. by Franklin, Jefferson, LIncoln, and other well-known men of our own. They considered his acts, acts of supreme courage (which they were). He also had a huge sense of humor and timing, and was quick on his feet and could put down the highest ranking Lords (one of which was the King's own fat son). He and William Pitt complemented one another to great effect in Parliament, and they were practical joke players who would aid and abet in setting up those who needed to be taken down a few pegs. Yet in all this, Wilberforce did so without meaness...and this movie shows this.    I wish this movie would be shown in history classes throughout the world. Our children need to have better examples than what they currently are exposed to. A truly great movie.    Karen L. Sadler
1594489505|5.0|Beautifully written and thought provoking, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is a story of love, courage, and friendship.  Hosseini's ability to weave an intriguing and emotionally charged story is amazing.  Mariam and Laila are two women living in modern day Afghanistan, struggling to survive oppression.  When there paths cross the author effectively explores complex relationships and a wide range of human emotions.  He clearly captures the details, and struggles, of everyday life while skillfully setting the story within recent historical events.  This deeply moving account of family, friendship, and love is a wonderful accomplishment.  Congratulations to the author for writing a book that brings to life far away places and describes what so many of us cannot even image.  Mariam and Laila's unbreakable spirit and amazing courage will leave readers astonished.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Many people think that there is nothing better than whatever USA makes.  This excellent documentary by Michael Moore shows how mistaken they are. Moore interviews real people trapped by the American healthcare business who cannot get medicines or medical services because they are too expensive.  Then he goes out to compare the American system with that of Canada, France, England and, believe it, Cuba.  On each of them regular, middle class citizens could get all the services they needed either at either a very low cost or free of charge. This documentary raises a question for Americans to answer: should the health of the people, either rich or poor, be treated as a free enterprise or should high quality healthcare be guaranteed to everyone? I recommend this documentary.

B000WE660M|5.0|Much of Britney's latest CD is more subdued in the dance beat department, not what you'd expect from her. Granted, most of the songs are `danceable', but they don't have that hard hitting feel of some of her biggest past hits, although, it is definitely nice to see her moving into a more mature sound. I love Heaven On Earth, with its retro 80s electronica dance feel, and Get Naked is classic Britney. In fact, the strongest tracks on here for me personally were tracks 5-9...until I heard the bonus tracks. Track 13, \\"Outta This World\\", is a mellow jam with a catchy melody, but it's really just a warm up for the stunning tracks that follow. Track 14, \\"Everybody,\\" is NOT a cover of the Madonna dance classic (now that would have been hot), but this is one of the best dance tracks on here--heavily samples Sweet Dreams by Eurythmics, including Annie's vocals. The whole CD should have been this infectious. Track 15--no, not a cover of the Beatles \\"Get Back\\", but ANOTHER standout dance jam in the style of recent Nelly Furtado. How could these tracks NOT have made the original cut of the album??? And finally, track 16 is another HUGE reason to have this pricey import (along with track 14!). The Paul Oakenfold remix of Gimme More is here in its FULL 6 minute plus version!!! This remix was not available on the import CD single and all I can say is WHY NOT??? This hard electro house mix is the BEST remix I've heard, giving added attitude with a driving beat and a hard bassline. Amazing.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a must see for anyone that lives on the planet.  Even if you don't have an HD television, the pictures are still breathtaking.  It's the most claming, relaxing viewing I've ever seen.    It's also great to have on in the background muted during parties or while you're waiting for something.  You can dip in and out and still appreciate the few minutes you've watched.
B000MRX6SO|5.0|I recieved this as an gift. I have had not problems with it at all.<br />It works great at keeping the stairs clean inbetween regular vaccums.<br />I would buy this again & again!!!!!!!!!!
0440238609|1.0|We are asked to rate this book.  There is no option for a negative to the infinity.<br />I think this triolgy should be retitled \\"satan's instuction manuel\\"  These books are clearly the work of someone who is extremely EVIL.  No matter how the reviews water down these books, the end results are evident.  Pullman wants GOD dead in the eyes of children.  I read the books with my eyes open and can't believe what he espouses.  I am deeply saddened that Nicole Kidman has appeared in the movie since I heard that she is a devout Catholic.  Parents please keep your children away from the movie and books, it can only bring harm.<br />There IS NO REDEEMING FACTOR in any of the books.
B00005JPS9|1.0|I didn't buy \\"Beowulf\\" for one minute.<br /><br />Director Robert Zemeckis, who built his career making enjoyable films like \\"Back to the Future\\", \\"Romancing the Stone\\" and \\"Forrest Gump\\", has been exploring the realm of computer animated films recently. He has even gone so far as to develop new technology so he can more convincingly capture actors portraying the characters he then has animated. His first foray into this field was \\"The Polar Express\\" in which Tom Hanks played a number of characters and all of the children in the film looked like soulless zombies. In \\"Monster House\\", the technology was used to better effect because the characters were highly stylized and looked like animated characters. They weren't trying to be real, so we buy into the scenario more readily. Now with \\"Beowulf\\", Zemeckis' uses Ray Winston, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn, Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich to portray various characters in this completely computer generated universe. The characters look like the actors playing them, but they still move with the jerky movements common to video game characters and they still have that soulless zombie look in their eyes. My question is if you are going to go to the trouble to try to make Ray Winston look like Ray Winston (with the use of a body double), and Angelina Jolie look like Angelina Jolie, why not just use the actors in front of animated backgrounds, ala \\"Sin City\\" or \\"300\\"?<br /><br />It's strange that Zemeckis, who began his career making such fun and enjoyable films, starring personable actors (Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner) now chooses to make completely lifeless films using a technology replacing the very likable actors with pale facsimiles of themselves (Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins, Robin Wright Penn).<br /><br />The story begins with a party in a remote Danish kingdom. King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) are having a celebration, but the king has become very inebriated and seems to disgust his younger wife. Their merriment causes the great beast Grendel (Crispin Glover) to awake, his head pounding with the noise, a noise he must stop, so he attacks the village, killing many. Distraught, Hrothgar hopes for a miracle and promises his kingdom to whoever can slay Grendel. Enter Beowulf (Ray Winston and a body double). Beowulf treks to Grendel's lair and slays him, but now he has to deal with Grendel's mother, a dangerous beast who takes the form of a beautiful woman (Angelina Jolie) who vows revenge. She tempts Beowulf and they eventually battle. When Beowulf returns, Hrothgar makes him king, as promised, and gives him Wealthow as his wife. Then Beowulf must deal with other forces.<br /><br />Much like \\"Sin City\\" and \\"300\\", the use of computer animation is a really great method of recreating a land and time long ago. In this case, the filmmakers use this technology to create the remote, snowy Danish vistas of yesteryear. And the work is interesting to look at. Remote huts and community buildings look interesting and add some interest to the story. These same sets would cost a fortune to recreate and would probably not look as authentic as they do in this film, so creating them with CGI is a necessity.<br /><br />But because much of this film takes place in caves, or on snowy plains, the film retains a `cartoony' look, resembling a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. Really, some of the scenes in the film look like the background keeps repeating. This is not a good thing when a film is trying to be hyper-realistic.<br /><br />Zemeckis has spent a lot of time developing technology to make this type of filmmaking more realistic. Basically, they put an actor in a suit covered with tiny transmitters. They film the actor acting out a scene. They import the scene into a computer and the computer tracks these tiny emitters as the actor moves. This allows the animator to add clothes, costumes, backgrounds, while the movement of the character remains `natural'. Zemeckis has developed this technology to add facial expressions to the mix, something they were previously only able to do in limited doses. Unfortunately, it didn't work very well in \\"Polar Express\\", making all the children resemble zombies. In \\"Monster House\\", it was better. In \\"Beowulf\\", the facial expressions are a bit blank again. The characters certainly look like the actors they are playing, but the expressions seem a little off, the eyes a little vacant. I really think this has to do with the fact these are real actors playing the characters. The technology seemed to work in \\"Monster House\\", but that was because the characters were less realistic and cartoonier. In the two films where the characters are supposed to be more realistic, they appear more like avatars in a video game. Speaking of avatars, James Cameron is reportedly developing his own technology for his next film, \\"Avatar\\", due in 2009.<br /><br />Equally important are the character's body movements. In \\"Beowulf\\", the characters seem to move stiffly and even in a jittery fashion at some points. It just isn't convincing and makes everything seem more like a videogame. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was an ad for a Wii game.<br /><br />Okay, let's put these things aside for a moment and address the story. The main conflict, the battle between Anjelina Jolie's character and Ray Winstone's happens in the second act. This leaves a lot of time, too much time, for the story to meander and try to paint a picture of Beowulf and a younger woman (Allison Lohman) having an affair, while Wealthow (Penn) looks on. Yawn. Then, the filmmakers seem to realize they need to have a climatic ending and throw in another battle. At this point, it just makes the film seem long. Too long.<br /><br />The 3-D technology has improved greatly. Disney is doing some interesting things with this technology and has made a new film \\"Meet the Robinsons\\" and re-released \\"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" with this technology. These new films look like they are truly 3-D, gone are the lines and shadows we used to have when this technology was first introduced in the mid 50s. There was a trailer for the first live-action 3-D film using this technology, next summers \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" starring Brendan Fraser. It looks like an interesting idea, but the clips they showed in the trailer make the actors look flat as they traverse a 3-D landscape, much like the characters in Zemeckis' \\"Polar Express\\" and \\"Beowulf\\".<br /><br />Film wouldn't be where it is today without filmmakers experimenting and creating things like Panavision, THX, Roadshow presentations, 3-D and CGI to enhance their own films. Because of these advancements, we have had the pleasure of watching new films that could one day be considered classics, films like \\"Sin City\\", \\"300\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\". Without the development of the water creature in \\"The Abyss\\", we would never have had the amazing special effects used to create the Terminator in \\"Terminator 2.\\" In a way, the work of Ray Harryhausen on films like \\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\\" led to the amazing special effects used in \\"The Matrix\\". It seems difficult at this point to imagine, but perhaps, perhaps, one day the work Zemeckis is currently putting into these films and this technology may one day lead to some enjoyable, memorable films.<br /><br />But right now, we have \\"Beowulf\\", which is anything but.

B00005JSGK|5.0|One of John Wayne's best non-western movies. The movie takes place in Africa following a band of exotic animal \\"hunters\\" who capture animals for zoos. There's plenty of action & an international cast that's pretty good. Red Buttons co-stars & all but steals the movie. Hardy Krueger (Flight of the Phoenix) is here also as a more than credible assistant. Elsa Martinelli is the female lead but is weak in her portrayal.    This is about where Wayne began his dabbling with international casts, male & female. In general these casts were weak which only served to make the Duke look better. The film director is Howard Hawks, whom Wayne had worked with before on numerous occasions, so the film is in very capable hands. In this movie we get actilon, comedy & drama. The scenery is great. We also get a song that was a classic \\"Baby Elephant Walk\\". I dare you not to hum along while this is playing. This is a very good movie & stands as one of John Wayne's best films, no matter which genre.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Songs and video are outstanding, but the thing comes in a cardboard 'insta-scratch' cover.  What were they thinking?  If you're going to buy this, be very careful extracting the discs and transfer them to jewel cases.
B00000HZTB|4.0|I have most of Lou Reed's albums, but never got this one. I wish I had gotten tis CD sooner, because it is a great album from start to finish. A bit of a departure from some of Lou's other work, more of a textured, airy sounding record. I like every song on this album, which is rare for me. It is funny how certain really good albums seem to fall in between the cracks, this is one of them.
0743298039|5.0|I read this book from cover to cover while sitting in my father's hospital room as he recovered from surgery.  I was completely engrossed and thoroughly enjoyed the story.  It was a pleasant surprise!
B000UBMSB8|4.0|Saw the \\"Final Cut\\" in the theater yesterday, and all I can say is THANK GOD, THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASE IS FINALLY AVAILABLE on DVD.  Like others have expressed, there is simply no getting around the superiority of the original release over the many lame versions that followed. Not only does the narration aid in giving you Deckard's p.o.v. and evolving character development, but is essential in making (albeit, only some) sense of the story.  The \\"Final Cut\\" adds very little other than a few seconds of beautiful visuals extending 4-5 scenes, but the expanded score (and I do LOVE the score) actually undercuts certain scenes where silence was much more effective.  It's too bad we are forced to purchase the box just to get this one version, but at least we are getting it and the price is right.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Disney did well transfer this wonderful movie into blu-ray, pack with good features as well.  This is no mean of perfect blue-ray film, however i think the major cons of this movie, it has probably the most ads prior the menu. I had to skip like 10 times, why disney do this? can't they just put those in the menu instead....  Feature is very good collection, it has pixel mini film included and several HD documentray.  Really bring more to the movie, in fact i was amaze they actually show alot of real life chef cook dish in full dish, it was amazing.  I don't know why disney choose this film not full screen like other disney blu-ray, oh well. But still a solid 5 stars, a must own for any blu-ray, a great demo for you home theater system well.
B00005B6C9|4.0|I just received this as a gift from a relative who knew that I really liked the early Bee Gees, so, it was with a high degree of trepidation as I put this disc on. It began with the title cut \\"This Is Where I Came In\\" which was the only song I had heard from this album. It's one of the best Bee Gees songs with it's sparse production using, primarily, an acoustic guitar & featuring their formidable harmonies. Other great songs featured here are \\"She Keeps On Coming\\" (reminded me of the Kinks), \\"Man in The Middle\\" & \\"Voice in the Wilderness\\" (reminded me of Cheap Trick).    The truth is I am very impressed with this album. There are moments when they sound like their old selves (\\"Wedding Day\\") & there's a throwback to the big band era (\\"Technicolor Dreams\\"). Maybe it was because I was a little more openminded about this, owing to the reason I was impressed. But why was I so apprehensive? I've heard these guys most of my life so I know what they've done & capable of doing. But the thing here that impressed me the most was their ability to ROCK (gasp!). There are a couple of songs here where they really lay a groove down & why is that so shocking, after all, these guys practically invented disco & THAT was certainly based on a groove. This is an impressive album by the Bee Gees who've stood the test of time & lasted longer than 99.99% of the rock acts that have come along. There are reasons for that & This Is Where I Came In gives ample proof of that.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have bought in a long time.  Well worth the money.
B000W04S6U|5.0|This music is so sweet, it is like candy to my ears. I have all three soundtracks and the sets, and I highly recomend this to anyone who likes dramatic music with out words and that is easy to listen to. Actually my mom used some of this music in her masters degree presentation at a leadership conference and she got many good comments from alot of PhDs about the music and where was it from. Shockingly it is from Halo, a video game. Cannot wait to hear the music for the movie or for Halo Wars. Sad that there were no rock and roll type of music, but that was not featured in the game like it was in Halo 2. The Odyssey and Blow Me Away where featured in the game, so the 3 star rateing guy can shovel it.  Rock on Mr. O'Donnell.
0634049011|4.0|I know it says workbook in the title but I never gave it much thought until it arrived. It is a workbook just like in high school.    For example, here is an empty fretboard diagram, put a circle where all the A notes should be.    It wasn't exactly what I was looking for but the information and exercises are definitely worth doing. It is neither a waste of time or money. I've been playing for 25 years and I learned things.    I do recommend it and do believe it is one of the better things out there today for learning guitar. \\"Chord Tone Soling\\" is certainly worthy of 5 stars so you might check it out also.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|It's a well written, twisted tale, but even more so because Dexter isn't really that scary. He's a pussy cat to his sister and girlfriend, he's easily taken advantage of, the only differnce is that he's a vigilante killer, but he doesn't do it in anger or hatred, just a sense of purpose, which is the most disturbing part.
B000TUXL2A|1.0|The mellow, sparkling and insightful Mark Knoppfler I've loved for years has taken a wrong turn inward with this album.  Maybe too subtle for me, but I found the music after one listen to the among the most uninspiring, depressing and boring of any music I've actually paid for in years.  I would have liked to select 'no' stars but had to select one.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Wow, this is the best adaptation related to Peter Pan I have ever seen. Great film, footage, cast, acting, scenery = AMAZING! Although I hear a lot of controversy over whether Jeremy Sumpter fit the role of an English boy, I believe he is the perfect Peter Pan. His lack of an accent is something I believe Peter Pan would have lost over time.    My only negative critique is having to see two innocent boys' rear ends hanging out of a tree.
0316067598|5.0|Lone Survivor is a uplifting, and heartbreaking story of courage under fire.  Marcus Luttrell tells his story in clear, unashamed candor.  From his goal to  join the Navy SEALS as a young man, through training and the actual combat incident that cost the lives of many brave warriors, his continued faith in his calling, mission and teammates is obvious.  The honor of all of these men makes me proud to be a fellow veteran.  A great read and a inspiring story.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|When I got wind that Brit's label was rushing \\"Blackout\\" to the market, I assumed it was just their way of finishing their contractual obligation with Ms. Spears (in light of her recent scandal watershed).  While that may still prove to be the case given the cd's dismal sales performance, I believe her label has missed a golden opportunity to revive her ailing career in that \\"Blackout\\" is surprisingly GOOD!    The first single \\"Gimme More\\" is an excellent club track but hardly the best on the cd.  My personal faves?  \\"Piece of Me\\", \\"Ooh, Ooh Baby\\", and \\"Heaven On Earth\\" hands down.  The first fave is a great challenge to the tabloid media while sporting near-perfect production for the song.  The second comes to us from co-writer Kara DioGuardi (and friends)... she of Celine Dion's \\"Taking Chances\\" and \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" among many other hit songs.  \\"Ooh Baby, Baby\\" is just a great tune with an excellent hook.  My third 'fave' (\\"Heaven on Earth\\") is a fun homage to the 80's progressive dance group Berlin.  My daughter and her friends (mid-teen age group) have latched on to \\"Radar\\" and \\"Break the Ice\\".  I think any fault with other tracks lies with the producers who seemed to miss 'opportunities'.  Most notable of the 'coulda been' tracks are \\"Freakshow\\" (which needs to be much more aggressive and which lacks bass and bottom) and \\"Perfect Lover\\" which just seems unfinished.  The one track that annoys me to no end is \\"Toy Soldier\\".  All in all though the cd is fun and enjoyable.      Look, Britney has never had the great voice and pipes of others like Christina Aguilera.  She has been more of a song stylist like Madonna.  Anyone expecting great vocals has obviously not been listening to any of Britney's past efforts.  Sometimes, though, an artist is an artist because of their style.  \\"Blackout\\" marks a return to Ms. Brit doing what she does best: putting her own stylistic spin on some great tracks.
B000WQW988|5.0|I have to say that a couple of months ago I wasn't aware the official DVD version of Nirvana Unplugged didn't exist, I thought it did !! I went to several stores asking for it but never found it, confusing huh ?? because it is really one of the best Unplugged's up to date.    When I found out the release date I instantly preorder it and right now that I watch it in full quality and crystal clear sound, man !! I have to say that it is something out of the ordinary !!    May Kurt Cobain rest in peace +
B00005JPTI|5.0|The special effects of this movie are amazing and Will Smith puts in the performance of his career as Robert Nevell, a survivor of a virus who drives around Manhattan shooting at deer and visiting the video store by day.  At night, he and his dog are locked in their apartment while crazed creatures (a la Dawn of the Dead) run amok outside.    The movie never gets boring and there are several bone chilling scarry parts.  Smith takes Nevell's character way beyond Matheson's novelette and surely beyond Vincent Price's or Charleton Heston's earlier renditions.
0060558121|5.0|AN EXCELLENT BOOK! You should set aside some serious time for this book, because once you get into it you won't have time for anything else (food,work,sleep etc). I definitely recommend this book to anyone, particularly those with an interest in mythology and ancient religions. Even if you aren't into those things that much, the book will still provide an excellent read!

1844137872|5.0|In this book is an excerpt from a letter in which a young man asks Banksy to stop stenciling his childhood neighborhood because it makes the area seem hip and Yuppies are moving in, raising housing prices such that this young man cannot buy a house here. Banksy's book is filled with inspiring, hilarious, and very intelligent statements accompanied by witty captions, but his work is the kind that speaks 1000 words by themselves. A true public artist, Bansky also offers his tips on how to take a town by storm in only one night. The art in this book is a response often times to public advertising; it is essentially a way for the public to respond to the ads that we are forced to see. A great and intriguing book.

Mr. Tolle offers insight into the way our minds create the insanity around us by focusing on the past or trying to predict the  future.  He tells us to stay present in our lives to experience joy.  The book is life changing in its message of the interconnectedness of the entire planet & beyond.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|This is a great DVD if you don't already own this.  What is nice is that the color version of the movie is made available to own for the first time on DVD.  I hope the next release of the movie has a \\"Real Documentary\\" on the making & marketing if the movie.  ALso how the movie became public domaine and then somehow was reclaimed by the studio.

I dont know what that last one is I havnt watched it.

B000I0QK74|5.0|JAMES TAYLOR AT CHRISTMAS includes the most beloved Christmas songs.  With producer Dave Grusin and various musicians, John Pizzarelli, Toots Theilesman, Chris Botti, and a host of others, James Taylor spreads a little Christmas musical cheer.  This collection is a treat for those who enjoy listening to the sounds of James Taylor; he provides a unique style to each classic song with a tinge of jazz, blues, and folk.<br /><br />The CD contains 12 wonderfully crafted songs, which makes this a five star collection.  Indeed, there had been many versions of \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,\\" but who has heard James Taylor's rendition, especially his bluesy version of \\"Jingle Bells\\"?  Music aficionados may agree that \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" has always been done as a duet, and who better to do the playful vocal commingling than Taylor and legendary vocalist, Natalie Cole backed with a bossanova rhythm.  Joni Mitchell's seasonal classic, \\"River,\\" is as memorable as the original, and it even has little snippet of the Christmas carol, \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" within the intro of the song.  The CD proceeds with the all-time holiday classics, \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and \\"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire).\\"  The four remaining tracks exceptionally compliment and conclude the CD with their solemn but very James Taylor distinct sound, \\"Some Children See Him,\\" \\"Who Comes This Night,\\" \\"In The Bleak Midwinter,\\" and the traditional \\"Auld Lang Syne.\\"<br /><br />JAMES TAYLOR AT CHRISTMAS is a highly recommended CD, which will be a nice addition to your collection.  So, after the holiday shopping or chores have been done, set the kindling to the fireplace, sit back, relax, and enjoy.
B000TQAF8M|4.0|Many say an artist's third album will either make or break them and basically decide their longevity.  Well step up to the plate......Oceansize with their 3rd album `Frames'.  With a line up change due to personal circumstances which saw Steven Hodson coming in as the new bassist; I expected `Frames' to unlock a new door in terms of the direction of their sound and it certainly did.      My first impression of Frames was that it was heavier than its predecessors.  However after further inspection it became apparent that it is both their heaviest and their mellowest.  They have basically taken their sound spectrum and stretched both extremes even further.  This is no more apparent than in the track entitled, \\"Sleeping Dogs and Dead Lions\\", which is probably one of the heaviest tracks they have ever done and certainly heading into metal in places, the intro in particular reminds me of The Deftones.  Then right next door to this track you have album closer `The Frame' which is your slow moving epic in the same vein as \\"Ornament/Last Wrongs\\" from `Everything into Position'.  They are completely different songs but both achieve the same thing which is a great and fitting climax to their respective albums.  The beauty of `The Frame' lies in the simple build up; starting off with a slow a gentle guitar riff and gradually all the other instruments come in one by one.  Then Mike Vennart's voice enters with \\"I can hold you all together\\".  It's such a relaxing while epic song, never in a rush, letting their sound expand till eventually it bursts with a crashing climax.    The best song on the album for me is `Unfamiliar'.  It took me a while to realise that `Unfamiliar' was a song in its own right because of the seamless link from the first track `Commemorative 9/11 T-Shirt', I thought it was part of that song until I looked down at my MP3 player when it clicked.  Its starts off easy, then it's as if the song swaggers into bar, knowing every other song is looking at it, thinking I wish I was that good.  My favourite bit in particular is the very last quiet/loud part where Mike Vennart sings \\"And all who sail in her\\" then really explodes into \\"Saw the seashore, unfamiliar\\". A great song and one I would definitely recommend if you want to get pumped up for the day.    On the other hand, the worst song on the album is \\"bonus\\" track `Voorhees'.  I put the inverted commas round \\"bonus\\", because I feel this song ruins the album.  The main thing I have got against this song is that it feels so disjointed, as if it is two different songs glued together. It is not a bad song apart from that, but at the same time compared to the rest of the songs on the album I feel it is somewhat sub standard in comparison.  Not only this but \\"The Frame\\" is for me is the natural album closer and that is how it should finish! A twenty second gap does not make me think \\"ahhhh that's the end of the album.........oh wait there's a bonus track\\".  Instead, it makes me think that after `The Frame\\" has finished, \\"that's it, what a finish to an album.....then there's more\\".  It's like when your up for a promotion you deserve to get and you've done everything right then all of a sudden just when the finishing line is in sight you somehow manage to talk yourself out of it.  This is exactly what effect `Voorhees' has on the album.    One of the reasons I feel the bonus track may have been included is to give the fan `Value for money' by filling the CD which comes in at staggering 77 minutes and 41 seconds.  The irony of it is if this was indeed the approach is that if the bonus track was taken out, the CD would still have been 67 minutes long which is still twice as long as your average album.   Anyway, on a more positive note, the lengths of the songs are one thing I love about Oceansize, while many bands have songs 3 minutes long.  In your average Oceansize song, the song is probably still not reached the chorus in that time.  There is never a rush, as the let their ideasflourish and expand naturally as opposed to forced and condensed into 3 minutes.  Nothing shows this more than the fact the shortest song on the album `Unfamiliar' is 6 minutes and 29 seconds.  To make this into a single they had to edit over 2 minutes out of the song!    Overall listening to `Frames' feels like within each song you're going on a journey through different countries and cultures; all within the world of Oceansize.  From post rock to epic rock ballads, from metal to Indie rock, it's like a genre hopping extravaganza mastering each impeccably.  What excites me about this band even more is a feel there are vast territories with in the world of Oceansize which are still lay undiscovered, even to the band themselves.  This is not one of those albums that you will listen to for a month move on to the next band.  This album is a slow burner and one which will be on my CD player for many months probably years to come.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|Certainly a decent action movie with solid acting with the likes of Pacino and the rest the great cast. I enjoyed it but it didn't have that fun side that the first movie had and not as much pizzaz as the second movie. It was like they sat down and tried to come up with the right ideas, but it didn't quite gel into the umph that made the first movie a hit and the second movie a reasonable expansion. It is still well worth seeing, I just don't plan to add it to my purchases. This is a family movie even though it certainly has an element of crime since items are stolen. However; you never see someone badly injured or killed. I recommend it for a rental. The DVD is great quality and includes standard extras.
B000VI70WM|4.0|Some interesting compositions and a fresh sound with a typical Duran feel.  Not sure it will appeal to the diehard fans, its a long way from the early '80s!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|But I had to this one time. I liked this movie alot, period. The story and the music combine for a believable tale of two people with loads of emotional baggage bringing out the best in each other. The story is probably familiar to many people, from those who have already lived it to those who dream the story will unfold for them at sometime in the future.    Given the opportunity to see Glen and Marketa performing as members of the Swell Season last month, I was amazed at how many people were touched by this movie. Based on the audience, the movie embraces people of all ages, from those still in their fundamental high school and college years to those who have experienced a bundle of springtimes. Perhaps it is all an act, but Glen and Marketa seem extremely genuine and seem to really enjoy making music together. What a great night that was.    I rarely offer advice, but I will break with tradition this one time. Please see this movie. There's a real good chance you'll enjoy it as I did. And perhaps you'll be writing your first review as well.
B0007TKNIS|1.0|... and that says it all. The singers are NOT professional; they bawl, blare and bleat alternately. If you are considering this purchase for the sake of music - don't go for it. You will be undergoing non-stop torture for the duration of the film!

B000NVIXDW|4.0|I see that among Amazon's currently top-selling \\"jazz\\" albums, \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" remains at the very top of the list (as has been true for a couple of months) with two additional Buble albums in the top 5.  Although listeners who so quickly and decisively proclaim him the next Sinatra merely betray their ignorance of Ole Blue's unique talents, accomplishments and significance over the course of a 60-year career, Buble is a highly deserving musician--better him than any number of other heirs-presumptive.  (For one thing, he doesn't come off as presumptuous, but rather expresses his gratitude to be part of a tradition that includes many noteworthy predecessors and which has produced a golden repertory of songs from America's greatest composers.)<br /><br />Where Buble comes closer to Sinatra than other singers is not in repertory, vocal range, projection, articulation, and heart-wrenching readings of challenging material but in rhythmic feel.  Sinatra was the Olivier of ballad interpreters, but he was also a veritable \\"swing machine,\\" so insistent on an \\"in-the-pocket,\\" infectious, big back-beat that he would eat any drummer alive who couldn't find it (more than one drummer has said Sinatra was the only singer who could swing).  After the Dorsey years, Sinatra wouldn't perform with Buddy Rich (too short a stroke), and when the Chair's hand-picked drummer Irv Cottler died, the demanding vocalist auditioned a continuous stream of potential replacements, never finding the right one.  The point is that Buble manages to \\"groove,\\" to \\"get down,\\" to \\"settle into\\" that special Sinatra time feel that's especially apparent on the Sinatra/Riddle \\"Songs for Swingin' Lovers\\" and on every recording Sinatra made thereafter.  The newcomer is so comfortable with the groove that he takes Harold Arlen's \\"I've Got the World on a Sting\\" at a more laid-back groove than even the predecessor and makes it swing.<br /><br />As for that lisp, some female admirers have told me it's sexy, irresistible, adorable.  I can't argue, though after the bobby-soxer days were over for America's first matinee idol and mega-pop singing star (as early as 1947-48), the predecessor could no longer hope to get much mileage based on sex appeal.<br /><br />[I just tuned into Buble's New Year's eve show on PBS--the last half hour.  It was indescribably awful--a garrulous kid yakking his chubby face off and not singing anything of substance.  Buble's in his thirties.  By that age, Sinatra had become an adult--physically and musically.  In fact, even listening to him sing \\"If You Are But a Dream\\" in his twenties is to hear an artist who has as much sheer vocal technique as Caruso or Bjorling.]rable.

B000WMFZNS|5.0|I too have been waiting for years to see a good DVD release of this great film epic. The Criterion laserdisc has the best look (better than the French PAL DVD), but it used a 35 mm print, not the original 70 mm print, as its source.  Does anyone know if the forthcoming DVD from Miramax uses the 70mm print?
B0001YRVN4|4.0|I was hoping for double discs on all these classics as you would get if you purchase each individual movie. There's not a whole lot of bonus features. A few good ones but not alot. Kind of wish I just bought all movies individually for the 2-disc special editions.... BEWARE.    PS> Note that there IS one bonus disc for the whole trilogy (the fourth disc) however comprised of just 1 good doumentary and the rest are just stills and TV spots. That's it!    Hope this helps.

B00005N6KG|4.0|I go through a lot of these, and my running partner does too.  I use them for my daily 9-mile beach runs, so they get soaked with sweat, rained on, get bounced around for hours every day, and the cord gets yanked inadvertently upon occasion.  They are cheap and durable, and have good enough sound quality for NPR talk programs over crashing waves and wind.  They don't last long under the heavy use I give them, maybe a few months (700-800 miles of running).  Too bad my Nike shoes don't last that long anymore...    Out of maybe six I have used and worn out, only one pair was defective - one ear piece developed a buzz.  At 9 or 10 bucks a pair, I can tolerate the occasional defective unit.
B000QCUB8I|4.0|A great cd. I'm not all that knowledgable when it comes to dance music but I really enjoyed this album. I find this french duo to be very refreshing. I absolutely love track number 8 The Party featuring Uffie. It's a really upbeat song that makes me want to sing and dance without restraint. The opening track is also worth mentioning. It really helps set the mood for the rest of the cd. It's full of music that makes you want to party and have fun. I recommend it to anyone who loves fun music as well as anyone who just wants to party.
B000QUCNOK|3.0|In a year that featured such imaginative gems as \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", \\"The Prestige\\", and \\"The Illusionist\\", it was inevitable that a pedestrian effort like \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\" would get lost in the shuffle.    It isn't a BAD movie, it's intriguing at times and mostly watchable, but it's never really convincing.      Because the plot is basically a fairy tale, or fable, preposterous on its face, I think that the book was probably better at conveying the symbolism and underlying themes of obsession and the nature of art.    The translation to the screen is uneven in its tone and in the performances of the actors.  Ben Whistshaw plays the wraith-like boy from the streets, Grenouille, who is gifted with superhuman olfactory senses. He can whip together a perfume like a bartender making a cocktail, but he has ZERO personality.  He's a total cipher, and the movie is built around him.  Figure in torpid performances by Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman (a poor man's David Thewlis) and it doesn't add up to much.    \\"Perfume\\" has a visual palette that is harsh (acid greens and blues, ugly yellows)and a storyline that sometimes seems too obvious--- like the carefully arranged nude female victims, who look like they are auditioning to be art school models.    It isn't the worst period piece I've ever seen--I would just say it's undistinguished.  I can easily think of better films to spend time with. \\"Restoration\\", \\"Ridicule\\", and \\"Angels and Insects\\" are films that cover some of the same ground as \\"Perfume\\" in a far better fashion.
B00000634J|5.0|I love John Lennon and this cd has most of my favorite songs on it.  When it arrived, the cd itself was in great condition, though the case was a little cracked.     What's more, it actually arrived on the estimated date!

I think they sound very different now.. and I don't mean just more mature, but they're trying to do different stuff, and i think it sounds great.  My fave tracks have to be Everything but mine, Any other way, one in a million and Panic.. they really make you wanna dance!!!! Unmistakable is great too!  I really recommend this CD to all the BSB fans!

B000VBJEEG|5.0|What a fun movie this was! It was sweet, funny, charming & totally entertaining from start to finish. The animation is outstanding, but the best part is this movie has so much heart. It is an inspiring story with a really good message about pursuing your dreams no matter what anyone else thinks and is a good lesson in getting rid of prejudice & letting each beings special talents shine through. It is about believing in yourself, no matter the odds. My whole family loved this movie!<br /><br />Rai Aren
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I am finally thoroughly impressed with a Blu-Ray DVD. This is one to own if you want to see the full color sharpness of your 1080P tv. Can't say much for the sound as I don't have a receiver hooked up yet.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|The setup is pretty simple.  A dysfunctional family goes on a road trip so a little girl can achieve her dream of being in a beauty pageant.  Yet the beauty pageant in question is merely a catalyst for a family to realize its own shortcomings and unite and agreee on...something.    Greg Kinear is a father who is banking on the success of a 12 step self help program while his wife played by Toni Collette is putting up with the uncertainty of their future along with the suicide attempt by her brother played by Steve Carell. His character is a college professor who attempts suicide because of unrequited love from a fellow colleague. Paul Dano is the son who aspires to be an air force pilot whilst looking up to Nietsche and outright proclaiming his hatred for his family.  Alan Arkin is a profanity spewing and drug taking grandfather.  Somewhere in the midst of this, Olive, the young dauther, seems oblivious to the dysfuntion going on and just wants to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Paegant.    The road trip that ensues plays on their dysfunction, with witty exchanges between the talented performers.  The chemistry between Paul Dano and Steve Carrel is most affecting, despite the fact that Paul Dano doesn't talk for a good 2/3 of the film.    All of the characters have aspirations they can't quite achieve - like a desire overeaching their actual potential.  This is perhaps the most original concept the film has to offer.  In the end, it's ultimately about failure which is a sad concept for a comedy to address.  That the film is so funny and makes you feel so good at the end is an amazing feat.  The finale is a little over the top for my tastes, but there is something so human and honest about these characters that you can't help but want to jump in and help get their VW van on the road again.
B000IONJH4|4.0|Every once in a while, the Disney channel has aired the version of Dune that is over 3 hours in length and it fills in some story line gaps very nicely. I am surprised it is disowned by De Laurentis considering how many cult fans would buy it. I know I am not the only one out there who has as many different versions of the Dune releases as I do of the Star Wars ones. The very extended version has a long opening that gives background on the Spacing Guild, the Bene Jeseret (sp), and even the 2 houses of Harkonnen and Atreides as well as the Emperor and spice itself. It may seem unnecessary for the average movie watcher to have this much detail but have them try reading the book and if they are not used to deep science fiction, they will be more lost than watching the movie either extended or shortened. David Lynch knows what there is in the \\"vault\\" which is why he distanced himself from this release and not the standard DVD release with the 2:57 time run version. This film seems to have the same problem as Blade Runner and the Highlander movies. Lucas may have done justice to the original Episodes with the CG add ins, debatably but even with Empire, he could not add much to a near perfect film (except for a few light saber improvements and window scenes in Bespin). I will enjoy this HD DVD version of Dune as I have the others I own but still know there is more footage available that has been aired and for some political reason, at best, our De Laurentis friends reserve it. The family is famous for some great flicks including the Conan movies as well as some more recent attempts at good movie making.
B000000XCH|5.0|For some reason Cosmo's Factory was the #1 CD they did while still together. Everyone seemed to love it. Some of the best songs \\"Who'll Stop The Rain, Up Around The Bend, Lookin' Out My Back Door and Travelin' Band\\" were on this album. That is what was used back in those days. Ha ha Some of John Fogerty's best CCR work is put into this one CD. I still love it.
B00000DQSV|4.0|This is a great album. If you disagree, then you don't really like DD.<br />Skin Trade, American Science, Winter Marches On. Some of their best.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|So ... I saw it in the theater about 4 times.  How can I not love the DVD!?!?!  Truly the Best Feel-Good Movie of the year!  2007 has been a roller coaster for me.. and just seeing Nikki Blonsky.. you love her the instant she's on the screen.  Oh and James Marsden isn't hard to look at either...   Love this Movie!!!! John Travolta in drag is Fabulous!!! The DVD itself has a lot to it... havent tried the dance steps yet and couldn't find the sing-a-long .. but I dont care, I'm still finding great phrases each time I see the movie \\"plastic spaztic\\" lol. Rent it. You will SMILE. Buy it and it will be the movie you to go to Smile again.  No offense to Ricki Lake, but Nikki has Tracey Turnblad hands down!
B000WGNLLW|4.0|The album isn't perfect, but it is good. A lot of high points.<br />But honestly, 'skin divers' and 'zoom in' aren't that good.<br /><br />Funny, Timbaland's 'skin divers' is the worst song on the CD. I think Danja might be better. I thought working with timberlake/land was a mistake, they proved me largely right.<br /><br />DD should never have allowed Timbaland's voice to be heard on the CD.<br />I think they'll regret it.<br /><br />'Tempted' is awesome.

B000WC3864|3.0|First off, anyone who loves this film knows, that the now out of print, \\"Elite\\" edition, has the best over all picture quality (just compare the scene where Ash gives Linda the necklace, between the two versions, and you'll see that the Anchor Bay version is soft, almost to the point of being out of focus, where as the Elite version is much sharper) and it seems that no matter how many times Anchor Bay, \\"Remasters\\" their print of, The Evil Dead, they just can't seem to make it look any better.<br /><br />So what we have in this new, \\"Ultimate\\" edition, is the same old tired transfer of the film, this time in both wide and full screen formats (of which the major consensus is that the full screen version is the director's preferred aspect ratio, which is made even more evident during the commentaries for Anchor Bay's previous, \\"Evil Dead\\" edition (the one cropped to widescreen, but with both commentaries on the same disc) during the scenes where things in the picture are referred to, even though the widescreen matting on the top and bottom has covered them up, case in point, white rocks placed at the bottom of the cabin's front porch, which one of the commentaries refer to as looking like teeth, making the cabin look like a skull, are cropped out, in order to get the full shot of the large moon in the top of the frame (we where obviously meant to see both).<br /><br />And as for the, \\"New\\" material, it consists mainly of a 59 minute retrospective, with no Bruce or Raimi participation (although Rob Tapert and the, \\"Ladies of the Evil Dead\\", along With the, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz director and the Cabin Fever, Hostel director, to name a few, pipe in through out) which doesn't really tell you any more info then you already know, and also a couple of, \\"Ladies of the Evil Dead\\" talk sessions, which although interesting, aren't really all that worthy of an upgrade.<br /><br />Of Note: one of the, \\"Ladies of the Evil Dead\\" mentions at some point, having been at a commentary session with the other two girls, and since this commentary doesn't appear on this, \\"Ultimate Edition\\", DVD set, then it can only lead one to believe that another edition is in the works (probably, \\"The Ladies of the Evil Dead\\", Edition).<br /><br />There's also a, \\"From the Cutting Room Floor\\" feature, which is really just a cleaned up version of the deleted /alternate scenes, which already appear in both the last Anchor Bay and Elite editions.<br /><br />So, unless you can't get your hands on the, Elite DVD, to get the full screen version, want to see the, \\"Soccer Moms of the Evil Dead\\", are a completest (my particular affliction... lol) or just want to fork over more hard earned cash to the people at Anchor Bay, then this edition can be skipped, and you can begin to save up for the next edition.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)er two girls, and since this commentary doesn't appear on this, \\"Ultimate Edition\\", DVD set, then it can only lead one to believe that another edition is in the works (probably, \\"The Ladies of the Evil Dead\\", Edition).

B00005JPTI|3.0|first, Will Smith's performance was poignant and right on target. For most of the movie he was performing to the camera exclusively (no other actors). His performance was believable, but not as good as Tom Hanks in \\"Castaway.\\" However, I have to say that a good portion of the movie had this drag to it that almost made me fall asleep. Very slow in development, and lacked in suspense for a good portion of the movie. The strongest scene for me was immediately after his dog was attacked. I won't ruin it for you. The ending for me was a little disappointing and left me feeling empty. I felt like nothing was resolved.<br /><br />Conclusion: 3 stars, Smith is believable, however this was sold as an action movie and it failed at this miserably in this reviewers honest opinion.
B000CC4GEW|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the must convincing movie of a historic event I've yet to see. Movies of this sort will never lose their value.

0525950079|5.0|Historical purists will not be pleased. Neither will readers who make their selections based on the length of a book, or people who object to a little sex in their reading (World is hardly pornography), or religious fundamentalists.<br />But those who enjoy ripping epic adventures, historical settings, compelling characters, and plot twist after twist, should have a fine time in World Without End. Yes, it mimics its predecessor, but that is precisely what I, for one, was hoping for. Jumping back into Jack the Builder's  city after 200 years was a joy. Few writers on the scene today are capable of creating such appealing protagonists and such hateful villains. Few are capable of filling 1000 pages with heartfelt conflict, human mistakes and foibles, or gut-wrenching turns of event. Follett can do all of this, and has proved it again in World.<br />The treatment of the bubonic plague in World is worthy of comment.<br />Rather than focus upon the horrific physical element, Follett has chosen to represent the vast psychological, financial, and societal consequences of this most devastating of diseases: the breakdown of mores, conventions, and behavior, the inability to produce enough food, the utter uselessness of mere wealth, the failure of the religious establishment to meet the needs of its flock. It is difficult today to imagine that time, and the narrative here helps.<br />Circumstances change, but human nature doesn't. Here's hoping Mr Follett has another Kingsbridge novel in him, set perhaps during the religious and political upheaval the characterized the Tudor era.
B00008OLIC|5.0|While I was enjoying much lighter fare with Debbie Gibson's \\"Electric Youth\\" in 1989, I enjoyed \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" alongside that (proving that the Crue could have crossover appeal and retain their metal credibility simultaneously).  Even at 13 years old, I was a big fan of the Crue, and I enjoyed \\"Shout At the Devil\\" and \\"Girls Girls Girls\\" alot.  I was anxious to see how they would follow up their previous successes with \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" and I was not disappointed in the least!<br /><br />Sure, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" was a commercial success (in order to appeal to the masses), but that doesn't lessen the quality of Mick Mars's and Nikki Sixx's collaboration (which constitute the majority of songs on the album) or of the album in general.<br /><br />I fell in love with the video for the title track and it became routine to expect MTV to play it *every single morning* at 7 A.M. without fail in 1989 (which led me to promptly sing it every day in class - to the expected glare of the nuns).  I still get a good feeling every time I listen to the opening riff, thinking about what life this album injected into a pretty stale music scene back then (it's also good while driving.  Dare I say it's along the same lines as Steppenwolf's \\"Born to Be Wild?\\").<br /><br />One song that I believe is underrated is \\"Without You.\\"  It's one of the best slow songs I've ever heard - metal or not.  The wordplay of Mars and Sixx was just fantastic and doesn't sound dated in the least.  I believe the accompanying video got heavy airplay on MTV, but no matter how many times I listened to it, I never rolled my eyes when I heard it (which is the way I felt with Def Leppard's \\"Love Bites,\\" which got *much* heavier airplay than \\"Without You!\\").<br /><br />I was surprised when reading the credits that Steven Tyler and Bryan Adams were among those who sang back-up vocals on \\"Sticky Sweet.\\"  Now I can't help but notice their voices among the background chorus.<br /><br />The general theme of this album is that of sex, more sex, and drugs (continuing along the lines of \\"Girls Girls Girls?\\") - the drug theme obviously being the album's title.

B00003CXDD|3.0|Like I said, The Jungle Book meets Lord of The  Rings...with out the music of course. The story of a human child who must be brought back to human civilization set among a medieval landscape with various creatures such as dwarfs and evil monster warriors. Many similarities to LOTR, such as the dwarfs being afraid of humans and evil warriors. I enjoyed it, but think it's more worth your time to watch The Jungle Book and Lord of The Rings (1-3) back to back. The ending was not worth it though. I mean c'mon, willow is a character you're supposed to root for, but I was left asking myself why? This is the story of an average Joe who sets out on an adventure and ends up not doing anything all too special.

This new collection is a real tour de force of invention and realisation, both by Moore and O'Neill, a fine artist indeed, and really raises the bar as far as graphic novels are concerned. Except that it's not really a graphic novel, and this is where the missing star in a normally 5-star revue owes its demise.   Moore is a constuctor of excellent tales, from start to finish, with lots going on and a real sense, upon finishing, of a great thing read and finished: see From Hell or Watchmen. The Black Dossier is however not this at all. It is instead a hotch-potch of linked and thematically cogent stories, all coming from the central point of the LXG's conception and use over the centuries and all very good indeed, but it's not a third instalment, and that's what lots of people wanted.  I don't believe Moore is beholden to anyone in what he produces, and I don't think he should feel guilty for letting people down who wanted more of the same faux-Victorian high jinx as I and II, but there's no denying he'll be letting some people down here and this won't do half as well as the earlier books because it'll whip the rug out from under their feet.   Taken on it's own merits however this is a great book, the mix of styles and pure technical skills on show in creating 'lost' Shakespeare and Wodehouse amongst others needs applauding and creates a far longer reading experience as you can't whizz through this in one go.  Overall, better than anything else you'll read in a long long time.
0440238609|3.0|I purchased the trilogy because I saw a movie was coming out and I generally enjoy the books more and wanted to know the full background to the movie. In this case, without knowing all the drama about the author and his view on Christianity, I did not catch all the anti-christian thoughts that are supposed to be espoused.  Instead, I enjoyed the young hero that did the right thing even when society and those around her wanted to do something else.  I wasn't shocked by her first kiss as a blooming young woman.  I made note of the angel's relationship, but personally I don't think angels need to be thought of as male/female and put in the same light of our own human sexuality.  We expect angels to love deeper, and while the intimacy that was implied was eye-brow raising, I wasn't offended by their open and loving concern for one another.  So I'm glad I read the books, because, as usual, the media in reviewing the Hollywood version, which I haven't seen yet, is making the wrong points about the book.  I didn't offer it to my 13-year old daughter to read because I didn't think it was aimed for her level of reading, but I enjoyed the series. As with all books and movies, I recommend the parents know what their kids are reading and watching.  This isn't a masterpiece of writing, but short entertaining stories.
1401308201|5.0|This is a complete insider's look at the musical.  I love everything from the lyrics to the pictures to the script to the interviews with the writers and composers.  If you love the musical, you'll have an even better understanding and appreciation!
1594489505|5.0|Like 'Kite Runner', very well written, but very disturbing. Enlightening regarding life in Afganistan, particularly understanding the recent timeframe of the storyline.
0671015206|1.0|Not a good reading since there are a lot of good books to read. It is a pure waste of time and money.
0440238609|5.0|This particular story has seemed to cause quite the stir among the religious people i know.  I can see why, but it is just a story.  I find it to be fanciful and entertaining.  And so far as people who think it is blasphemous, it is no worse than any other persecution of religion by other religion that has been going on for centuries.  I recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy.  All you Darwinians out there would LOVE this series.
B000HT386M|5.0|fast shipping, good movie (i like to see that adam sandler is growing as an actor)
0440241413|5.0|This book mirrored my life, except in different countries.  So naturally this is a fabulous read.
1416911049|3.0|An OK book. Quick read, but not the most original concept. A chapter from the next book, \\"Pretties\\" is included at the end, and I swear the number of times the word \\"bubbly\\" showed up was enough to put me off the series entirely. I understand it's the whole point of being a \\"pretty\\" and how they talk, but I refuse to read dialog that sounds remotely like listening to a slang-ridden tween who can't speak properly.
B0001US62I|4.0|Alan Parker (Pink Floyd: The Wall) directed this stylish, atmospheric tale of evil and voodoo, starring Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel; a 50's era private eye hired by the mysterious Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro) to find a missing man who owes him big.  Of course we know who Louis Cypher really is, but what Angel has yet to discover as he makes a trek from New York to the voodoo-soaked swamps of New Orleans (where he is enchanted by a young girl, played by Lisa Bonet which garnered much controversy when the film was originally released) is that his search will have him make some incredibly shocking discoveries.  Undoubtedly one of the best performances of his career, Rourke is simply magnetic in his role as Harry Angel.  By the end of the film, he has garnered so much sympathy and disdain that you'll be glued to the screen.  De Niro is great as well, albeit his screen time is quite limited (that's why it says \\"special appearance by\\" on the cover), but he is nevertheless effective as the ultimate incarnation of pure evil.  The DVD itself from Artisan/Lion's Gate has a surprising amount of substancial special features, including commentary from Parker and Rourke, as well as documentaries on the voodoo culture.  Despite some of the plot holes in the story, Angel Heart is an effective thriller that leaves an impression thanks to Parker's startling imagry and Rourke's great performance, and if you've never seen it before and films with the devil tickle your fancy, give Angel Heart a look.
0316067598|4.0|Lone Survivor is a good, true-life adventure story of a U. S. Navy Seal, Marcus Luttrell, who, along with three other Seals, was dropped into Afghanistan's Hindu Kush Mountains in 2005. The team's mission was to locate and kill or capture Sharmak, a dangerous leader of a Taliban army. Upon insertion, they unexpectedly ran into three civilian goatherds whom they detained briefly. They suspected that these men might be Taliban sympathizers and would alert the enemy of the Seals' presence. The Seal team's discussion about what to do with them is fascinating. After a few minutes, they released the goatherds. Their suspicions were confirmed soon when a Taliban army attacked. The four Seals put up an amazing fight on impossible terrain.    Luttrell and his co-writer give plenty of background on Luttrell. You learn of his childhood. And you go to Coronado Island, California with him to the Seal school. Someone thinking of joining the Seals might find this section fascinating. But after a few pages of it, my interest wore thin, and I skipped sixty additional pages of same. I wanted to get back to the story of the battle and of Luttrell's escape from the Hindu Kush.    In that battle, the Seal team killed perhaps eighty or ninety Taliban soldiers; but, of the four Seals, only Luttrell escaped death. He did so through the kindness of strangers, simple opium farmers and goatherds who live in a village built into the side of a very high mountain. The Taliban hesitated to take Luttrell from the villagers by force for two reasons. Firstly, the villagers are themselves armed; and they had accepted the badly wounded Luttrell as a guest--a sacred status that guaranteed his protection by them even if they had to fight to their deaths. Secondly, the Taliban are able to survive and operate in those mountains only with the tacit consent and support of the mountain people, and if they were to slaughter the people of the village, other villages would learn of it and turn against them. ButLuttrell's survival was touch-and-go nonetheless, because the Taliban are willing to kill certain individuals and to beat children.    While all the drama goes on in the mountains, a vigil goes on in Texas at Luttrell's parents' farm. Hundreds turn up from all over the nation for this vigil. The reader is bounced back and forth between the mountain village in Afghanistan and the farm in Texas. After about three times of this, I found myself skimming several additional farm scenes, wanting to get on with the rescue of wounded and now sick Luttrell.    The early part of the book has the uncomfortable feel of a book written \\"with\\" a professional writer (in this case, Robinson). Later, the story seems unquestionably to be in Luttrell's voice. There are many simple grammatical errors in that latter section which can be easily forgiven of Luttrell who is a warrior and, until the publication of this book, not a professional writer. But it makes one wonder what Robinson was doing. And what of the editors?    All in all, it is a very good story and worth reading. Moreover, the reader will learn what Luttrell learned about the Afghan mountain people and the Taliban and of our chances of winning in Afghanistan. The American public should have this information. The public should also read Luttrell's words about the dangers inherent in the \\"rules of engagement\\" set up by smugly ignorant and misinformed Washington bureaucrats and politicians, comfortable and safe in their offices and homes, thousands of miles from the life-and-death situations experienced by American service men.
031286504X|4.0|A very good read. Full of suspense, well written. can't wait to watch the movie.  Just a warning to buyers-the book it self is 312 pages....I am legend is only 160 pages. The rest of the book are short stories. The short story prey is quite chilling and an excellent read. I would have given this book 5 stars, it was truly amazing, but being so short and the short stories confused me i rated it at 4.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I saw the trailer and was intrigued by the layout so I gave the movie a shot and walked away wanting to turn around and watch it again.  I went home and bought the Deluxe CD from iTunes and listen to it everyday! I can't wait for this to come out so I can watch it again and again! I love the way they matched the music up to the story line so well.  The movie left me with a great feeling, which doesn't seem to happen much any more. I would say I fell in love with the movie and of course I would recommend this movie!
B000P0J024|5.0|I just got this as a gift.  I thought...Wilburys?  It's been a long time.  So I play the audio.  \\"You Took My Breath Away\\" applies.  This is a truly great rock n' roll album.  We have an incredible eclectic collection of George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, and (on the first album) Roy Orbison, all intermixed and/or taking turns to get their licks in, and at the top of their games (Roy's song \\"You're Not Alone Anymore\\" may be his greatest song, IMHO).  The guitar rock - acoustic or electric - is simply terrific and driving.  The lyrics are mostly great.  The presentation is like a dream: leading vocals by some of the greatest rock voices of all time, sometimes switching from one great to another.  The backups of course are marvelous.    I won't go into details - there are some outstandingly perspicacious reviews below, where fans tell one everything that needs to be known about who does what, how they came to be, etc.  Buy and savor this album.   They don't make 'em like this anymore.
B000001ESJ|5.0|This album is often overlooked, even though it contains some of the best Rush classics--Closer to the Heart, and Xanadu.    Closer to the Heart is one of the all time Rush Classics--great melody and inspiring lyrics flowing seemlessly in a beautiful song.  If you've ever experienced this song live in concert, you understand that it can be an emotional experience listening and signing along to this track.    Cinderella man is a great story perserverance, and the title track has a great baroque quality to it.  The only bad part is a track called Madrigal.  Even all these years later, it sounds terrible-I don't know what they were thinking.    Cygnus X-1, is an incredible epic song that is continued on the entire first side of their next album-Hemispheres.  Cygnus X-1 and Hemispheres represent the peak of Neil Peart's fantasy concept album epics-a bit difficult to digest and take in all at once, but the creativity and the music are top notch.    This album is a must for any real Rush fan if only for the inclusion of the epic Xanadu.  Although dated from an instrumental standpoint (old school synth etc), this song represents a culmination of the early efforts of Rush, screaming vocals, heavy guitars, complex drumming and percussion, coupled with an ambitious undertaking in presentation and songwriting.  Xanadu will take you far away, and spark your imagination.  That is what art does. And that is why Rush is one of the premier artists of all recorded music.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|What can I say about this flawless disk that others have not said already? Mille and co. are capable of and show on the Enemy of God, how bands like Slayer, Metallica and Megadeth may have had some good running in the 80s and early 90s, but Kreator, who originated around the same time, is eternal in awesome quality of music they keep delivering. EOG is the Countdown 2 Extinction meets Reign in Blood meets Master of Puppets equivalent of the masterpiece thrashmetal record of the 2000s. The songwriting is so good, I am having a hard time picking favorites or songs to put on repeat. This is just awesome metal. I think if I let this play in my car, it will completely take over and bar anything else from coming in. I have not enjoyed a thrashmetal CD this much since Rust in Peace, period...Anyway, Kreator is scheduled to enter the studio early next year to record a follow up...I can hardly wait, and I will be willing to pay any money to wrap my Polak paws on it as soon as it comes out. Phenomenal work from a seasoned band of geniuses who show their peers how its done in the 21 century.
B000XA5K48|5.0|This is not a serious movie. Or rather, it is not a movie to be taken seriously. It is a cartoon action piece, with more nods to Looney Toons (and Itchy and Scratchy) than you can shake a carrot at. The main 'hero', as played by Clive Owens, is constantly chomping on carrots (as well as using them for a few unexpected purposes). Picture Clive Owen deadpanning \\"What's up Doc?\\" and you'll get the idea. The villain, as played by Paul Giamatti, is a real-life interpretation of Elmer Fudd from the classic \\"Kill Da Wabbit!\\" musical. His ringtone is even 'Ride of the Valkyries'.    Most people that didn't like this movie took it seriously and simply did not understand the tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top, Bugs Bunny vs. Elmer Fudd aspect of it. The soundtrack is super high energy and guns are used in several original ways.  If you have a sense of humour, like action, are a fan of cartoon violence or even just a fan of Clive Owen (in top deadpanning form here), then do check it out.     That's all folks!
B000TGCR3S|5.0|Wow!    After this film I literally sat on my couch and contemplated the meaning of life.  So thought provoking, so dramatic, easily one of the best animes ever created.  This Anime is clearly a milestone not only in animation, but it proves once and for all that animation can be just as thought provoking, just as riveting, just as exciting as live action.  Black and white are wonderful characters with a uniqueness unlike anything ever experienced in anime.  This anime is not a must have, it is a need.  I have watched this anime so many times and like the matrix or ghost in the shell it makes me think of something new.  This movie is not on the level of Disney, Miyazaki, or Watanabe.  It is on a level all its own.  For the anime lover searching for something different take a look at Tekkonkinkreet.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best sci-fi that has ever been created. Bar none. And it's not just sci-fi, it's sci-fi Western. Which is WAY cooler than it sounds. No stupid looking fake aliens, no matching shiny polyester jumpsuits. Just humans, human nature and a gritty, humour-filled and realistic protrayal of how it would probably be. And a fine analogy and tribute to the losing side of a Civil War, with the 'losers' forced to the outside, untamed parts of space.     This show focuses on the outcasts of A New Order, which makes the story, situations and characters FAR more interesting than anything else that could have been done with it. And unfortunately that lead to it's downfall. Some idiot at FOX couldn't understand why they wouldn't do the show about the Alliance, the people who won the War of Independence, instead of doing it about a ragtag bunch of outcasts who are marginalized or on the run. And that person at FOX should be charged with crimes against humanity for stealing this show away from all of us. Excellence in television seems to be rewarded for one thing and one thing only, and that's viewers. And they didn't give this show enough time to find it's audience, cancelling it after 6 aired episodes (which weren't even aired in order). Just a debacle through and through. Probably the same person who cancelled Family Guy twice and then put the axe to Veronica Mars. But that's another rant for another place...    To the skeptical people who haven't checked Firefly out yet, all I can say is that this is not Farscape, Andromeda or any of the other generic, mediocre sci-fi shows that came on about the same time. I resisted even checking it out for a couple of years because I was so sick of all the crappy sci-fi that came out all at once, each with their own dumb-looking collection of latex alien sidekicks. It blows Battlestar Galactica out of the water. It also leaves my head shaking when I see generic garbage like Stargate on the air for 10+ years and this gets chopped after a handful of episodes. It truly boggles the mind when framed in that comparison.    This is all human and the most realistic, immersive sci-fi experience on TV or in the movies, which I largely credit to it's Western influences. Outcasts, reluctant anti-heroes, men of honour, revenge, gunfights, double-crossing villains, etc. are all Western standards, playing out as morality tales. Nathan Fillion is as good in this regard as Henry Fonda and John Wayne were in any John Ford classic, coupled with a very wry sense of humour. And Joss Whedon is nothing short of God when he's on the business end of a pen. The entire cast is perfect in their roles and all I can say after watching the entire series on DVD in the order it was meant to be seen is thank goodness for Serenity! I cared so much about what was happening to these characters and where their individual story arcs were headed that I would have felt cheated forever without seeing at least SOME loose ends tied up with Serenity. Even so, I am still left wanting more. So much more. And that is truly the mark of excellence.
B000VI70X6|5.0|Shakira is my favorite artist, i have all of her albums. Period.    Unfortunately due to my job i couldnt attend this tour, i went to the mongoose and the amphibian tour and those were great shows, always amazing. But this had to be the exception.    The show is great as usual, great songs, great performances, and a great artist.    The only thing that i dont like is that she should have performend more from the oral fixation albums (i would have loved to see How do you do and En tus pupilas live).    But its a great dvd, a must have for fans.
B000063DHK|5.0|I remember this was one of the first CD's that I owned, back in the day when CD's came with a booklet not just a two page insert.  When this album was originally released on CD it was one disc and one of the best songs, Phantom of the Opera, was not included.  The only way to get the other songs was to buy the tape.  When this CD was released by Capitol it was one of the best Concerts ever recorded and it was one af a few that was digitally recorded.  Most people will agree that for 1985 it was awesome.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|\\"Live Free or Die Hard - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)\\" is the BEST edition of the latest \\"Die Hard\\" installment, and certainly THE one to buy. Closest in spirit to the previous three films, the unrated version is more cohesive, funnier, and less PC than the 'cleaned-up' theatrical edition...but if you prefer PC, this edition offers the option of BOTH versions to choose from!<br /><br />Willis' 'John McClane' is the most likable of the action heroes introduced during the testosterone-driven 1980s, an honest cop unwillingly caught in the middle of brilliantly-conceived schemes of criminal masterminds, defeating them by outlasting them, physically, while tossing off some of the funniest one-liners you'll ever hear on screen. It's a formula ideally suited to Willis, and the latest installment, created by filmmakers who grew up on the original trilogy, succeeds in keeping things 'fresh' by raising the stakes, and playing up McClane as a 'dinosaur' in a high-tech world.<br /><br />The plot involves the shutting down of not a building, airport, or city, but the entire country (to steal billions of dollars...as McClane quips, \\"It's always about money\\"), and, aided by a pacifist computer geek (Justin Long), and his uber-hacker buddy (a very funny Kevin Smith, in a welcome cameo), Willis is ready to abuse his body again, to save the day!<br /><br />While the film's villain (Timothy Olyphant) lacks the urbane villainy of Alan Rickman or sophisticated panache of Jeremy Irons, his second-in-command (Maggie Q), is the sexiest opponent Willis has faced, yet, and the action sequences (done mostly 'live' rather than by CGI), are truly astonishing (particularly Willis 'taking on' a fighter jet in an 18-wheeler...you have to see it to believe it!)<br /><br />The 'Special Features' ARE special, as well; my favorite is an interview between Willis and unabashed \\"Die Hard\\" fan Kevin Smith, which manages to be both insightful and funny.<br /><br />Yippee-ki-ay INDEED!
B000PDZJ1W|5.0|Amazing!!!  I've heard people say that there is no difference, but it is meant to be EXPERIENCED with a surround system.  It's breath taking all the little differences you've never heard before.
B000VEA38E|2.0|so much has been written already about the brilliance of the music of the original star wars trilogy.  there's no question about that. it's john williams' best, if not the best, musical score of the so many great movies he had scored.<br /><br />in time for the 30th anniversary, rca victor again reissued for the nth time the glorious recordings of the three movies. enough of the reissues. all the music for star wars had already been released in 1997, in time for its 20th anniversary - complete with wonderful packaging and crisp digital recording.  this is even a better compilation that the 1993 boxed set of the star wars trilogy soundtrack (read my other review for that!).<br /><br />in 2004, sony again reissued the same set of recordings but without the wonderful packaging and hologrpahic design that made the 1997 recordings such a collector's item!<br /><br />now for the 30th anniversary, a new reissue - this time featuring the original 1977, 1980 and 1983 design, complete with the RSO label design, and the 2004 cover package. great sound. another wonderful packaging.<br /><br />this set is actually intended for those fans who were not able to buy the 1997 recordings, including the corellian edition featuring tidbits of episodes 1-6 (although this is not great. rca could have included the real highlights of the six movies, and this would even be more of a collector's item (which i am reminded, why not record an audio counterpart of the bonus dvd of episode 3? now that would be great!)<br /><br />i am rating this a two star because this is again another reissue. but for the music, i always give john williams a five!
B001152TL6|5.0|It took way too long for this film to be released on DVD, but I'm sure glad it finally has been. Modern film noir at it's finest.
B00000ILDE|5.0|\\"aliens\\" is arguably one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. intelligently written and superbly acted, it is one fast-paced movie (despite the total running time - with even an additional 17 minutes in the special edition!)<br /><br />waking up 57 years later after the 1st movie, ripley (great acting from sigourney weaver!) learned that her daughter died at age 66, her license was revoked after her damaging testimony with the owners of weyland-yutani, the \\"company\\" who wanted the alien life form back to earth, and she kep having bad dreams.  bothered, ripley finally agrees to lead a team of marines back to LV-426, the human colony who lost contact with the company.  the rest is superb sci-fi movie history! with a team of great cast led by michael biehn, bill paxton, carrie hehn, william hope and jeannette goldstein as the tomboyish vasquez, aliens was a sure box-office truimph and critical success.<br /><br />the transfer was so clear, i was able to see things that i thought was not in the movie. the sound and pix are crystal clear! i have never seen aliens like this!<br /><br />buy it: even if you're no alien fan, i am sure you will love this chapter!<br />avoid it: if you already have the boxed set, or sci-fi is just not your cup of tea.<br /><br />:)
B000VL9XE2|3.0|.....But the singing is definitely NOT one of 'em.  The rage and angst is gone from the vocals, but not from the music.  The ferocity and complexity remains, and this CD would have worked so much better with no vocalist at all.  It's detracting and distracting.....just plain awful.  This guy never did anything substantial or interesting in his career except front a band where the best thing was the drummer's hair.  Faith No More fans....all 8 of you, try and calm down.  Musically it holds your ear constantly, and to tell ya the truth, it's hard to believe they even pull some of the stuff off.  I will probably listen to it a few more times, then only pull it out if someone asks.  It won't hit my ipod, but it won't end up a drink coaster either.  Dump The Singer!!
0765318741|3.0|This book was short and interesting, but the ending left me hanging. It reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock.
B000I5YCCO|2.0|It's puzzling to really find what anyone see's in this girl.  The theme of her material has very little range,  her voice included.   Vocally Swift is extremely weak,  aided largely on her cd by 'studio tweaking' to enhance those limited vocals.  To hear her sing 'live' just let's the cat out of the bag every time.  It will eventually be her downfall.    Although her songwriting is decent,  it mostly carries the same themes.  If she can expand on her writing abilities,  Swift may be able to put together a career in songwriting.  She will need that in order to stay in the music industry because her 'mediocre' singing will catch up to her within a couple years.  You could say that she has an 'expiration date' stamp on her forehead and her record label is gonna use her up as much as they can before then because they see it coming down the road.    As a further example of Swift's mediocrity.  Her version of \\"White Christmas\\" on her Target exclusive Christmas cd is a glaring example of her limited vocal talent.  She noticeably strains to reach the higher notes - with flawed results.  Bing Crosby would have nothing to fear of being outdone here.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|I loved this movie, my parents loved this movie, my nephews and nieces loved this movie...definite must see.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|This is a great CD. It came on time and was completely intact. No scratches or shipping damage. The music is really good too. Easy to listen to from start to finish with very touching themes.
0439882826|5.0|Wow!  I love this book that is like a real work of art!  I am really amazed at the talent it took to create this 3D book.  Kids will love this one.  Even grown up kids like me!    [...]
B00005JMFQ|5.0|There are lots of LONG reviews of this movie here on Amazon. Read them if you have nothing better to do. Otherwise get the movie and watch it. Watch it with someone you love. Watch it alone. Make your dog watch it. Doesn't matter. This isn't Milton. The cast is a who's who of British actors at their comic best. There are wistful scenes of hard choices made selflessly. But mostly it is outrageously funny.  Just watch out for the eels.
B000001FS3|3.0|I give it a three, because I like the way \\"With or Without You\\" builds, which reminds me a teeny bit of \\"The Unforgettable Fire,\\" but misses that mark--that song is like a symphony, this is just a single movement.  I listened from the beginning--Gloria, I Will Follow (off Boy and October, which were kind of uneven albums, IMHO), but I liked War (New Year's Day is really good), and I loved The Unforgettable Fire, mostly for that track, but the rest is good listening as well.  This album was just SO hyped, and like many have said, \\"Where The Streets..\\" and \\"And I Still...\\" are just too over-the-top, and they sound alike.  (I love what the Pet Shop Boys did to \\"Where The Streets...,\\" to which Bono cunningly(?) borrows a PSB song to ask them, \\"What Have We Done To Deserve This?\\"  :-)  Too big for your britches, and it gets worse, I fear.  I think I'll like them again with Achtung Baby and POP!
B000FL7CAK|3.0|The series was great. I really enjoyed watching the episodes.  My problem was that 2 of the 6 DVDs were defective.  Disc 3 froze during several episodes and disc 5 had episodes where I could only hear the audio. The screen would go black for several minutes at a time.  I bought the series new to avoid getting a DVD that didn't play. Next time I'll just buy it at the store.
B000002U9W|5.0|I have never done drugs. Honest. But this album made me hallucinate. Made the room spin. It was 1976, I was on a leather couch in my sister's apartment, alone, and put this record on. (They were on records back then.)    Amazing. Groundbreaking. If you want to safely open your mind without chemicals, this is the way to go.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|In a day of mostly \\"GARBAGE\\" out of Hollywood it is \\"GREAT\\"  to find a Family Movie that compares to Walt Disney of Old  not necessarly the New - It was so outstanding we bought  Seven CD's to give to our Grand Children for \\"CHRIST\\"mas gifts.

0805079831|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It really makes sense of a great many things about the contemporary military-industrial-disaster complex that previously seemed to be just insane or incompetent. Klein traces in frightening yet extremely well-researched detail the rise of a new breed of capitalism that not only feeds upon but lies in wait for and often helps create human and ecological disasters from which it can reap tremendous profits. Still more distressing, she shows how the Bush administration over the last  six years has opened up  government itself as a new kind of unexplored territory of resources waiting to be plundered by disaster capitalists -- which has in turn helped give birth to hugely successful war profiteering corporations like Halliburton, Blackwater and the rest.  My one complaint is that her suggestions for hope are quite thin and wan in the last few pages... but maybe that's simply Klein's realism and honesty? In sum, an often depressing read, but an excellent book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I saw an episode of this series on the Discovery Channel and was very curious to see more.  I have not been disappointed in the least.  There is a wealth of information in this documentary.  The filming, subject matter, and narration are all far above anything I've seen before.  There is also a section included at the end about conservation that makes you want to get out there and do anything you can to save our planet and animals!  You won't regret owning this extraordinary series!!
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Compared to today's attempts, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is short on hamburger and splatter.  It is a classic buddy movie, somewhat contemplative, with a story line that invites you to pay attention, and humor that is shared with a nudge and a wink.  If you don't know the story, and don't know the movie, you keep wondering how they will get away.  Surprise!!
B00005JPRG|3.0|As i sit and watched this movie, i can say that i got into it when it started all the way till almost the ending and then..it just got stupid in my view. It has a lot of \\"zombie\\" action than the 2nd movie, but, the ending was just too dumb and can someone tell me why does Milla have to be nude in every film she does??...Anyways, its an \\"OK\\" film, but, wasn't worth the $8 at the movies thats for sure. Buy this film if only your a Resident Evil fan, however, if your looking to buy the film cause you had not seen it yet...Rent it first..it'll save you the money!. Rental movie only!!!
1591396190|3.0|This book addresses a fundamental requirement of all business owners: In order to succeed, you must swim into uncharted waters and create a unique identity. Now that we know we're dealing with the concept of branding, there are five books I've read prior to Blue Ocean Strategy:    [[ASIN:0071460829 Marketing Warfare: 20th Anniversary Edition]]    This book introduced the military concept of \\"flanking\\" (staking your claim in an uncontested area) over 20 years ago.    [[ASIN:0060007737 The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding]]    More on branding from Ries & Trout, with an additional 11 \\"laws\\" specifically targeted toward Internet branding.    [[ASIN:0321348109 The Brand Gap: Expanded Edition]]    \\"Five disciplines to help companies bridge the gap between brand strategy and brand execution\\"    [[ASIN:0321426770 Zag: The Number One Strategy of High-Performance Brands]]    As in \\"When your competitors, 'ZIG', you must 'ZAG'\\"...as the back-cover copy states, it's a book on how to \\"out-position, out-maneuver, and out-design the competition.\\"    [[ASIN:0743256050 The Power of Unfair Advantage: How to Create It, Build it, and Use It to Maximum Effect]]    A tough, no-nonsense book from a business writer who witnessed the transition of \\"Silicon Valley\\" from orchards to semiconductor firms. He also summarizes Ries & Trout's \\"flanking\\" principles.    So the question is \\"After reading these books, what new insights did I gain from Blue Ocean Strategy?\\" The answer? Not many.    The first problem I have with the book is the writing style of the authors. It's just a personal preference. I prefer the more direct, hard-hitting styles of the authors I've listed above. I found myself two or three pages into selected chapters and thinking \\"Are you EVER going to get to the POINT?\\"    The second problem is that there seems to be an attempt to build a \\"working model\\" or \\"paradigm\\" and what I find myself with is a grad student term paper that doesn't really climb into the real-world business trenches with me.    YES, Cirque du Soleil makes for an interesting case study. But I'm more interested in the hard-core, nitty gritty realities of stepping out onto the battlefield and making my business stand out.    I strongly urge anyone considering the purchase of this book to either thumb through it in your local bookstore or head on over to Google Books and read the available excerpts. The writers will either win you over or they won't. I gave the book three stars for the importance of its subject matter and docked it two stars for the writing style of the authors.

B000IOM0YM|5.0|My first concert was the KISS Dynasty tour. It was loud and I new all the songs cause I was a fan that had all their records. I was a kid kiss fan.  My first kiss record was Rock n roll over. It was a Christmas gift in later 70s.    The Mike Douglas Show, The Midnight Special, Documentary Cadillac, Michigan October 1975, The Paul Lynde Halloween Special, and Don Kirshner's \\"Rock Concert\\" Brought back lots of childhood memories.    Later on another Christmas, Santa Clause brought me the kiss Alive album. I have old pictures of me holding this double record set in front of the Christmas tree. I used to listen to the record and look at kiss pictures from music magazines. So watching the concert on DVD was very special to me.       Deuce, Stutter, Got to choose, 100,000 years *(Peter Criss drum solo), Black diamond, Come on and love me, and Cold gin were my favorite songs.    I saw Kiss pictures in hit parade and circus magazines as a kid and even buying the kiss comic book. I wanted to read everything I could get my hands on about the band. I had a few friends in school who shared the same feelings as well.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This DVD Leon is the original version of The Professional. The Professional is often seen on American cable tv. However this version was only shown to international audiences because some of the material, particularly the relationship between a 13 year old girl and 40 something year old man, would be objectional to uptight American audiences.     The story starts by introducing us to Leon as he takes a \\"cleaning\\" job from his boss, a fat Italian Don working out of a small restaurant in Little Italy. In the first job that we see Leon perform; Leon expertly wipes out an entire drug gang using a variety of lethal methods. He scares the drug lord senseless and forces him out of town. Then we learn that as great as Leon is as a hitman he seems to lead a very lonely life. He lives alone in a small NY apartment building. He always wears a coat because he is armed to the teeth with guns, grenades and other explosive goodies. He sleeps sitting down fully dressed because he fears reprisals. His only companion is a plant that he dotes on lovingly. He leads a clean life as he exercises religously and constantly drinks milk. Leon interacts with Mathilda, a neighboring teen who lives unhappily with her family. Mathilda's father is contracted by crooked DEA agents to hold bags of pure cocaine for them. Unfortunately for Mathilda's Dad he puts his hand in the cookie...er coke jar. This leads the DEA agents to come back and get their coke. This crooked group of DEA agents is led by a drugged up nut named Stansfield(played to the hilt by Gary Oldman). Stansfield loves Beethoven, drugs and guns. In a great scene Oldman dopes himself up with a funny-looking green/yellow capsule then proceeds to go ballistic on Mathilda's family; shooting Mom as she lays in a bubble bath, blowing Big Sis away as she runs screaming down the hall and even blowing away Baby Brother. The catch here is that Mathilda has gone to the store and is away as her family is being executed. Upon Mathilda's return shesees that her family has been whacked and knows that she is next if she doesn't think fast. So she knocks on Leon's neighboring door. After much waiting, Leon opens the door saving the girl's life.     The movie then shifts to the relationship between the illiterate 40 something hitman Leon and the smart 13 year old budding beauty Mathilda. The actors Jean Reno and Natalie Poortman in her debut do a fantastic job of creating a relationship that is sweet innocent yet sexily forbidden. Here is where the International DVD \\"Leon\\" differs from the American version \\"The Professional\\". Leon gives the viewer 24 minutes of footage that was part of the original version. These 24 minutes give us more detail on the relationship and how Mathilda pushes Leon to be intimate with her yet Leon can not due to his past and also his guilt. It is a sad tale of a great love that can never be consumated.     In the conclusion, Stansfield reappears and is determined to get Leon and Mathilda. The conclusion is all explosions and bullets but the viewer is left with the memory of the love story between Mathilda and Leon. This love story makes LEON a great and unforgettable film.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I love this movie. It's a great concept. I love the actors in it. They are really stepping out of the that you normally see then.
0393327655|4.0|I agree with much of what was written in this book, although I hope I am wrong about my belief that people are taking the words of Mr. Harris, Richard Dawkins, and other atheist writers too fundamentally (sorry to apply that label, but I believe it is accurate).    I fully believe that humanity can benefit from approaching the world and problems more rationally.  I fully believe that religion is unnecessary in terms of creating a \\"moral\\" and just society.  But, when I read other reviews where people say that \\"we must challenge religion\\" and \\"religion does more harm than good\\" it makes me think we need to be more specific.      It is FUNDAMENTALIST religion that is the real problem.  When you speak of war, martyrdom, terror, and social conservatism, you are speaking of fundamentalism.  Fundamentalism is present in all religions, and describes a good percentage of Christians in the United States.  The problem is, we as non-believers are becoming fundamentalists about our beliefs that religion and faith are bad.  We're ignoring the details and intricacies of different systems and levels of spiritual belief.  That type of thinking is too black-and-white...dare I say, irrational.      It seems to me that we need to focus more on complexity than on rationality.  If you think being rational can give you the one right answer, you aren't very rational.  We need to pay more attention to the nearly infinite number of shades of gray that color every single issue we encounter.  This is the mindset that will help us eliminate fundamentalist thought, whether based in religion, politics, emotion, or science.  We need to be more complex before we can attempt to be more rational.

031286504X|5.0|The absolute coolest vampire concept ever!  My friend recommend I read telling me how the ending left him speechless, and now having read it myself I can definately say it is the best ending of any book I've ever read.  The concept is that Nevelle is the last man alive due to a virus that changed everyone else into vampires.  The book starts with him making repairs to the outside of his, which he does every day due the damage the vampires do trying to get in at night.  His house has become his fort, the only thing that protects him each night from them.  He can't stray too far away during the day cause he needs to have enough time to get home and seal himself up at night, which removes any hope of him finding any survivors beyond a certain radius. By day he wonders out for supplies when he needs them and reinforces his house, and by night he locks himself in and tries to ignore the vampires outside trying to get him to come out.  The book is mostly about this one remaining man who's all alone, researching and trying to figure out what the virus is and how it works. At the end he is in a situation which explains the title of the book.  The book is very short, I was disappointed when I Am Legend ended after only 100+ pages with the rest being short stories.  But for such a short story it is still incredibly powerful and intresting, and the other short stories are worth a read too.... Don't let the movie ruin it for you, while it follows the same concept as the book it leaves out all the things that make the book so good.  They should be punished for changing the ending to the way they did.... BOO Hollywood...... LATE

0307387178|5.0|Into the Wild was a riveting, memorable book, based on real life circumstances.  I had recently seen the movie, and wanted to read the book.  Oftentimes, this can be a disappointment, as one medium seems to supersede the other.  This was not the case.  John Krakauer's book nicely augmented the movie, filling in more personal information about this idealistic young man and his belabored journey to find the truth about himself and his rightful place in the universe.<br /><br />Kraukauer had apparently been attracted to bring Christopher's McCandless's quest to go into the Alaskan wild to life, because of similarities to his own background and the conflicts that had besieged him in his own youth.  Thus, a literary relationship was forged between the author and the main character, creating an uncanny understanding and compassion which became a strong mainstay of the story.  Absent is judgement.  Rather, complicated family relationships are diligently researched,extrapolating what emotional bearing they may have had on individual perspectives cultivated and the ultimate choices made by each family member in this remarkable story.<br /><br />It is a bittersweet saga, one filled with humor, pathos and thought provoking wisdom in how one person sought the infinitely mystifying question, plaguing us all of \\"Who are we, and why are we here?\\"
0440238609|5.0|This is a wonderful fantasy trilogy that is a good read regardless of age. It is hard to find a good story line that doesn't borrow ideas from great past authors. It is original and thought provoking. I recommend these books to all fantasy lovers of all ages!

B000Y1ZXU2|4.0|Just so people aren't mislead by 2 other reviews here, THERE IS NO LIVE FOOTAGE (like they would include Swamp Song on the Vicarious dvd!)...    BUT, this dvd is definitely worth buying. Apart from the Vicarious clip which is excellent, you get more bonus stuff than their previous dvd releases for Schism and Parabola. The \\"making of\\" runs for 40 minutes and is informative with lots of interviews with people that made Vicarious. It also helps explain why it has taken so long for this clip to be made. The commentary with David Cross is suitably silly and I enjoyed watching Alex Grey's COSM section.     If you're a fan of Tool's you no doubt would have bought this by now anyway, but for anyone who has seen a low quality copy on youtube do yourselves (and the band) a favour and do it justice by buying the dvd.    Oh one more thing - there is no live footage.

B000065BPB|2.0|I listen to music all the time on my MP3 player, so I thought getting these better earphones would be a good investment.  Wrong!  I'm really sorry I bought them.        The sound may be pretty good, although they do leak sound so people around you can't help but hear what you're listening to.  And you can hear outside sounds, so you probably wouldn't miss the complaints of people sitting around you if you were riding on on public transportation.  But not to worry!  You'll probably never wear these big bulky earphones out in public.  Even if you don't care about the appearance of having these monsters on your head, they are so damned uncomfortable, you probably wouldn't be able to stand having them on more than 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes of being uncomfortable, you start moving into the pain zone.    I'm back to rotating with several pairs of earphones that cost less than $20 apiece.  They may not cancel outside sound, but at least they weren't designed by the Spanish Inquisition.
0440238609|1.0|I don't even know where to begin.  Just keep your children away from these books.  And FYI this is from someone who does not consider herself to be a religious fanatic.  The author has a lot of hate and nastiness in him and it comes pouring out in his writing.
B000VI6T6K|4.0|Good sound, great songs, big performance, the best power trio of the history of rock (with permission of some englishmen), what else could you ask for? Maybe the DVD version gives a better idea of the presence of the Jimi Hendrix Experience in Monterey, by I always found music DVDs less focused, less musical experiences than audio CDs (maybe I'm wrong, but it's as I feel it), and, besides the showmanship of Hendrix, I think his real legacy is a musical one, and this Live at Monterey is one of the 5 or 6 steps to consider in his coming to his throne.

Still, I do collect books, and it's a nice addition to my Sophie Kinsella/Madeleine Wickham books.  If you want to read more Sophie Kinsella and you've read all your shopaholic books, get Madeleine Wickham, that is Sophie Kinsella's real name, I believe.  In any event, it's the same author.

I then picked it up and read it  fairly quickly.  I didn't mind the way it was written and found  it held my interest.  While it would have been different had  it been an autobiography, it wasn't.  And there is no way to  prove if things happened exactly as told.  Yet it was a great  story and I'm sure the adventurous would just love it, especially  boys.
B00003CWTI|3.0|I'll count myself in the minority who don't think this movie is completely brilliant or alternately a waste of celluloid.<br /><br />No one can deny that P. T. Anderson is ambitious in the scope and style of the story he attempts to tell here. I found the multiple plot lines, acting and themes to be captivating. The final resolution (and the whole film for that matter) was completely original. The melding of music and story was beautiful. Anderson chose well in using Aimee Mann's music to reveal the complex emotions of the characters.<br /><br />Conversely, the acting (while well done) at times seemed out of place. As an example, the interviewer of Tom cruise's character seemed uncertain of her motivations. This disconnect at times made the characters seem histrionic. Also, the characters lives were so messed up, they failed to resonate with me (and I am guessing many viewers). I also thought some of the plot lines were left unresolved. If the idea was that many disparate events can soemtimes be joined in an odd way I wasn't persuaded.<br /><br />I did like the Cop who lost his gun. His resulting humility allowed him to accept a girlfriend who had more apparent flaws (drug use). But I think I kind of imagined that. Whcih goes back to my problems with the movie.<br /><br />But all else being equal, it was a beautiful, haunting and original movie. A masterpeiece? Not IMHO.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Arguably the best television series in the past twenty years. Even if you don't like sci fi (I don't usually), you'll quickly become engrossed in this  fantastic and thrilling world created by the talented Joss Whedon.
0743457900|3.0|For a good positive summary of the book, see the review by Jana Perskie.<br /><br />Now here's my thoughts: LeCarre's book isn't \\"bad\\" per se, but it is definitely a different style from most other spy genre novels. Remember, it was written in the 1970s - so forget the 'techno-thriller' books that Clancey made famous in the late 80s. LeCarre's books - this one included - were however an intellectual step up from the earlier spy/action thrillers...<br />The problem most readers will have is that there is almost NO action. Roughly speaking, its about Geo.Smiley trying to solve a problem (a mole) in the \\"Circus\\" using clues from the past. So a lot of it is contemplative and revolves around the \\"old boys\\" of the organization talking in circles at times about their experiences (reminds me of Kerouac and \\"On the Road\\"). The writing is very circumspect - and introspective - in that regard.<br />There are no Jack Ryans here, no cowboy heroes. The characters are all upper class (or have the pretensions, if not the birthright), understated Englishmen, and working in a decidedly bleak period. In fact, LeCarre's style seems to reflect the malaise of England and the west in general of the early 70s. That is due mostly to LeCarre's focus on the mental maze Smiley must navigate which leaves little room for descriptive settings or surroundings. Colors, seasons, etc (or rather, the lack) all seem to suggest a perpetually gray, damp late autumn day at 5 PM...<br /><br />This is NOT an easy read - one must concentrate, just like Smiley. Don't expect to be able to put it down and pick back up repeatedly without losing the plot. This is a wintertime book, one to read when its rainy and you have nothing pressing to do (and nothing on your mind).<br /><br />Its worth reading as an example of a more mature spy (or even drama) genre. But it is easy to see how the modern spy novel (techno-thriller) has supplanted the Karla-trilogy style for most readers...
B000VBJEEG|5.0|[***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad]<br /><br />I will never understand why this movie didn't do as well in the box office as Pixar's other movie \\"Cars\\" which I found tepid in terms of, well, everything.  Maybe movie-goers are more disgusted by rats than Pixar had anticipated.<br /><br />Anyway, our hero Remy is a rat who lives with his colony in the walls of a cranky old French lady's cottage.  Unlike his many, many relatives, Remy has a refined palate and dreams of being a famous French chef.  In fact, whenever he and his amusingly-gormand brother sneak into the old lady's kitchen, Remy will try to catch his favorite chef's cooking show on television.<br /><br />One fateful day, the colony is disbanded (I'll leave you to discover how).  Alone and disheartened, Remy floats into the waterways of Paris on the back of a cookbook written by his very own hero, the famous chef (who appears to him in encouraging visions).<br /><br />One amusing event leads to another, and soon Remy finds himself living in his hero's very own restaurant!  Soon he embroils himself in a secret partnership with a hapless human busboy who wants to impress a cute pastry chef (who has the most extreme French accent you've ever heard).  Remy will sit under the guy's hat and pull his hair as one might direct a plow horse to guide him according to Remy's advanced cooking knowledge as the young guy attempts to create culinary masterpieces.<br /><br />Several things impressed me about Ratatouille above and beyond its fun, fast-paced plot.  First, I liked how Remy and his human friend never really talk to each other.  The human guy speaks with other humans, Remy speaks with other rats, and the human guy rambles on with Remy the way we all talk to our pets.  But the only direct communication between them is when they first meet and the human guy asks incredulously, \\"You can understand me?\\" and Remy hesitates, and then gives a quick, nervous nod.<br /><br />Second, the animation is just unbelievably gorgeous.  Look especially at how Pixar does water images.  You will marvel.  Third, I love how the animators perfectly captured the body language and movements of rats.  I've had pet rats, and I'm here to tell you that they move with exactly that sort of plump waddle.  A very entertaining movie!Look especially at how Pixar does water images.  You will marvel.

1596912367|4.0|This is a well written, finely crafted work of literary fiction in the form a a spy novel. As others have commented here, there are parallel running stories of mother and daughter. Mother was recruited as a spy while living in Paris in 1939. With training, her Russian emigre identity was effaced as she became a fully professional operative.       Much of the action of the novel centers on Mother's encounter with her own past. What's missing is some deeper access to her interior life after WWII. How did she manage her complex identity--did she simply remain frozen? Had Mr. Boyd been able to open Sally's inner world, the novel would be even more impressive. It's still very much worth your time.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Really love it.  Love the costumes, the colors, the sets, and yes the story.  Has what most movies lack, especially those aimed at children, and that is charm.  No fart jokes, references to toilet duties, or burping (okay there may have been a burp). But those standard, formulaic, boring, tiresome, old hat, get over it, stop it please gags that seem to be in every single kid movie are not here. This movie makes my 3 year old giggle (donkey in hat and winking scene) and me cry (I thought it was only the PMS until I cried again upon repeat watchings). No ponderous hidden (or not so hidden) messages about global warming just a sweet feel good story...hey, how about that.  Enjoy.
1596680296|5.0|I am a complete visual learner, and  with the widespread availabiltly of \\"how to\\" videos on the internet, who needs to waste money on a still-shot book, right?    WRONG!    I have never found a video or tutorial on the internet that is a thourough as this book.  It completely explains each intimidating step of the construction of a sock.  I only recently learned how to knit and sock are only my third project.  I was able to make a pair of socks that not only fit me, but fit me well.      Another brilliant part of the book is that it has a basic sock pattern for every weight yarn.  So if you are either scared to use superfine weight yarn (or simply cannot find it due to unavailability) there are patterns from sportweight to DK to bulky, making it really nice if you are stash-busting.     Once you are comfortable with a basic sock, the book advances to show you techniques that involve lacework and how to use varigated yarns to their optimum beauty.  And because the book breaks down each individual part of a sock and variations on each part, you quickly find yourself picking and choosing from a variety of different options, making each pair of socks one-of-a-kind and your very own.    I highly recommend this book to any novice knitter who is dying to learn how to make socks.  It will be money well spend and a reference that will have a home on your pattern shelf for years.

I'm here to talk about exclusively of the HD DVD version which in my opinion is quite bad. I own the regular DVD and they both have the same video quality, which is not great. One should expect great video from an HD DVD, but this is not the case, so if you own the DVD don't bother. If you own the VHS, just buy the regular DVD. Oh, by the way I just have a 720p HDTV, so I haven't watch it on a 1080p HDTV, but I don't think it would make any difference.

You've got excellent actors here and a good screenplay but admire what we have in the end: the weakest of the Dirty Harry movies.

B000H5U832|5.0|We have owned Cars dvd since it came out on video. We love it and highly recommend it to any family, especially those with toddler boys. Our 2 year old can get quite destructive to other toys and stuff around the house, and we can put Cars on and he calms right now. He loves this movie.
0515141429|4.0|My favorite Lee Child book! Reacher is a friend of mine now. My daughter and I swop books and Lee Child's books are her favorites also. Now that we have read them all, what will we do?     Reacher's way of pressing his clothes (only one outfit he owns at a time) is most creative. His plots are so interesting and involved that you cannot wait intil the solution. He is kinda too gory for me but I skip some of that part.
B000CCD0FI|4.0|Brian Eno left to make some insane ambient music, titled something like Warm Green Science Tiger, and the group reformed. Their sound completely changed here, mutating themselves into a disco-funk/world music/new wave group. The lyrics are paranoid as usual, and the rhythms are great. Still, I miss Eno's weird production stuff. But it's still a great album. Everybody knows \\"Burning down the House\\", which became the group's biggest hit and justly so, combining a driving rhythm, ominous synthesizer and heavy, danceable grooves. This and the next three songs are golden: \\"Making Flippy Floppy\\" features some interesting faux-Indian keyboards in the bridge, with a first-rate guitar solo as well; \\"Girlfriend is Better\\" is pretty much just the group babbling about god-knows-what, but let's face it, few groups could do it better - besides, it's got a chorus that is physically incapable of leaving your head and a danceable rhythm; \\"Slippery People\\" has a cool call-and-response chorus, featuring some of the best backing vocalists ever to appear on any record, as well as cool percussion and weird synthesizer sounds. And try to listen to these without dancing! It's not possible. \\"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\\" is a rather lame retread of \\"Making Flippy Floppy\\", and it slogs at five minutes; \\"Moon Rocks\\" isn't much more than trivial, underwritten funk. But \\"Swamp\\", featuring one of David Byrne's strangest and most menacing vocal performances, is a classic, anti-nuclear war country-blues-new wave stomp; and \\"This Must Be the Place (Naïve Melody)\\" is one of the few wistful songs in the group's catalogue, packing a stunning synthesized string part. No, it's not Fear of Music or Remain in Light, and virtually everything closes in on or breaks five minutes via plenty of unneeded repetition (\\"Pull up the Roots\\"). Still a pretty good record.
B000WBZ5M0|5.0|This is a great movie, I definately reccommend all three (11, 12, 13), and even the originals to everybody. A must have movie for everybody.
B0000026KQ|4.0|Give credit where credit is due: Jeff realized Flash was a dead end and decided it was a good idea to continue following his own eccentric course. The result is by far the most diverse album in his career, containing several stabs at different genres that fail occasionally but succeed more often. Really, the only experimental track that comes up short is the new wave-ish \\"A Day in the House\\", with gawky, David-Byrne like vocals - among the few on the album, though sadly some show up on the goofy toss-off title song, an advertisement for guitars set to a painfully obvious '80s rock beat.  Much better are his stabs at... well, everything else. His lightweight, offbeat reggae experiment \\"Behind the Veil\\" is a definite plus; he cooks up two lovely ballads (the beautiful, intense \\"Two Rivers\\"; \\"Where Were You\\") that can be seen as modernized successors to \\"'Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\". Even more surprising is the fact that he succeeds with punk (the breakneck \\"Slingshot\\") and random '80s rock (\\"Savoy\\") in addition to the usual heavy blues-rock he just excels at in the first place (\\"Big Block\\", with a storming guitar riff - it takes a close second to \\"Two Rivers\\" as my favorite on the album). It's a shame that this gets overlooked as often as it does, in spite of a couple misfires - all the diversity makes it one of my favorite Beck records.
0316067598|4.0|Marcus Luttrell has an amazing story to tell.  This Navy SEAL served his country in Afghanistan.  While they were there his unit was asked to go on a particularly risky mission.  He and three other men were sent on a mission to either capture or kill Taliban leader, Ben Sharmak.    Unfortunately, things went wrong from the beginning.  The terrain that the SEALS had to operate on proved to be steeper and more rugged than they had planned.  They had less ground cover and protection than they anticipated.  Worst of all, they ran into 3 Afghans herding goats as they descended down a mountainside.  Luttrell and his fellow soldiers debated what to do.  They decided against killing the 3 Afghans and took the risk of being discovered by Sharmak's army.  Unfortunately, the three Afghans tipped off Sharmak.  As a result, he sent a large force against the four Navy SEALS.  With superior weaponry the SEALS killed dozens of Sharmak's soldiers.  Perhaps, if Sharmak had a slightly smaller force, they might actually have prevailed.  As it was, Luttrell's three comrades were killed and Luttrell was wounded. Luttrell's struggle to survive after what happened is an amazing epic.    Luttrell walked seven miles seriously wounded and by fortunate coincidence ran into a tribe of friendly Afghans. Luttrell owes his life to these tribesmen who were beseeched to hand him over to the Taliban several times before he reached safety. These tribesmen guided Luttrell until he could reach a village where he was rescued by Army Green Berets and other forces.    Luttrell is to be admired for the immense courage he shows throughout this ordeal.  Hopefully, he will serve as inspiration to many Americans.  He shows us courage, fortitude in the face of adversity, and intelligence in coping with very tough situations.
B00000260F|1.0|It was the mid-'80s, so I guess even Beck decided he'd dive headfirst into the gimmicks of the day, with the sterilized \\"heavy\\" guitars and the booming drums. He even buys into the then-budding industrial trend with \\"Ambitious\\"; indulges himself in hair-metal cheese on \\"Gets Us all in the End\\"; and introduces \\"Escape\\" with drum machines, synthesizers, and... vocoder. It doesn't help that it launches into '80s generic funk mode afterwards. \\"Stop Look Listen\\" follows the same path: cheesy overbearing synthesizers dominate, the vocals are laughably overdone. Is it supposed to be danceable? Because I'm not dancing. But at least it's not as bad as the record's nadir: the robotic dance track \\"Get Workin'\\", a poisonous stew of '80s clich&eacute;s; \\"Ecstasy\\" could've been at least decent if it weren't for the synthesized horns and artificial handclaps. By the way, are artificial handclaps not the stupidest things ever? I've already railed against them multiple times, though, so why repeat myself? Crappy song, that's the point. And that might not even be as bad as the \\"atmospheric\\" \\"You Know, We Know\\", with its sterilized, heavily altered guitar; or lame synth-pop duds like \\"Nighthawks\\" and \\"Night After Night\\". Then there's \\"Back on the Streets\\", a forced attempt by Beck to rock out. I don't know why Beck rocking out could conceivably feel forced, but then this record defies the laws of nature. The lone song worth listening to at all is a hit cover of \\"People Get Ready\\", but that's more for guest Rod Stewart's vocals and Beck's own guitar solo than the production, which is just like the rest of this. So yeah, one good song of eleven. Not a recommended purchase at all.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|2006's \\"The Illusionist\\" had the misfortune to be competing for audiences with \\"The Prestige\\", another magic movie done on a grander scale and designed to appeal to a wider audience.  This movie seems designed for a smaller art house audience.<br /><br />The movie opens with a prologue in which a common young cabinet-maker becomes interested in magic and draws the attention and affection of a young noblewoman.  Their romance is a forbidden one, and the young man leaves home to find his fortune.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" properly gets underway as the acclaimed magician Eisenheim returns to 19th Century Vienna after a long absence.  Played with stoic and enigmatic understatement by Edward Norton, Eisenheim peforms some remarkable feats on stage, so good that the viewer is never quite sure, until the end of the movie, whether he is the simple illusionist he claims to be, or something more.<br /><br />One night, a volunteer from the audience turns out to be the noblewoman Sophie (played by Jessica Biel), fiancee of Leopold the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, but once Eisenheim's childhood sweetheart.  The two contrive to meet in private, to the anger of Leopold, played by Rufus Sewell as an ambitious but abusive and drunken lout.  Leopold sends Police Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to warn off Eisenheim.<br /><br />Eisenheim and Sophie are soon committed to a desperate plan to be together, only to be foiled by Sophie's apparent murder by Leopold.  An angry Eisenheim begins a subtle campaign to challenge and undermine Leopold through his magic shows, initiating a contest of wills with Uhl, who is torn between his duty to investigate Sophie's murder and his ambition to rise with the Crown Prince.  As the movie spins out to its violent conclusion, the only thing the viewer can count on is that nothing is quite as it seems.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" nicely captures the atmospherics of Vienna in its last decades as capital of the Austria-Hungarian Empire.  The movie has a measured pace, meditating over its detailed period sets and relying on some superb acting, especially by Giamatti, to carry along a rather austere plot.  The ending is nicely done, if a little too convenient for the dark tone of most of the movie.  Sharp-eyed viewers may see it coming, but the movie tries hard to be subtle.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as good entertainment for fans of the magic genre.etailed period sets and relying on some superb acting, especially by Giamatti, to carry along a rather austere plot.

B000002L80|4.0|You know, when I first heard about this album I was ready and willing to rip it to pieces. I mean, a pop album? From Talking Heads? Yeah, that's right. It's their equivalent of Loaded by the Velvet Underground: proof they could've made good pop if they had chose to, they just never chose to. And besides, there's plenty of the group's personality here - as on the jumpy \\"Perfect World\\", and on \\"The Lady Don't Mind\\", which goes from a Pink Floyd-influenced intro to a full-on dance track. Anyway, there were several minor hits here: \\"And She Was\\" is pure catchy hummable fun; \\"Stay Up Late\\", about a perverted babysitter (At least that's my take) is fun bouncy piano-pop with wonderful guitar parts; \\"Walk it Down\\", despite having annoying keyboards, is still pretty funky and besides it has great lyrics; \\"Road to Nowhere\\" is enjoyably jerky and has a nice militant rhythm, even if the organ tone once again hurts it. But it's nowhere near perfect. For one, a bit of ambition wouldn't have hurt. For another, there are a couple songs I don't like here: the country-new wave hybrid \\"Creatures of Love\\" is awkward; the world music-flavored \\"Television Man\\" is endless; and there's nothing either here or there about \\"Give Me Back My Name\\". Plus there are some moronic keyboards. Oh well, it's a good fun time, exactly what it was intended to be. So hey. Can't complain too much. It's just that it's nowhere near Remain in Light.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|I ordered this without noticing it's not the Sigourney Weaver narration version I wanted.  I'm sure it's great but I wish I had paid more attention.  So, if you are looking for the one seen on Discovery, THIS ISN'T IT - as far as I can tell, same footage, different narrator.  Wish I had known that BEFORE I ordered it as it's a Christmas gift and now I'm scrambling to get the right one in time.
B00005AREQ|4.0|So Beck was done with funk, and instead decided to take fusion on. A fine choice for him, too, as it yielded three radio staples: the reggae cover of \\"She's a Woman\\", with a talkbox \\"singing\\" the main melody; the gorgeous, Stevie Wonder-penned ballad \\"'Cause We've Ended as Lovers\\", with Beck's emotive guitar; and the funky, hard-rockin' \\"Freeway Jam\\", featuring blazing guitar and funky drums. And a couple of the non-hit album tracks are just as good as the three big hits. For instance, \\"You Know What I Mean\\" rocks, featuring a tasty fusion guitar solo and awesome keyboard work; the lighthearted \\"Thelonious\\", another Stevie Wonder contribution with more talkbox; Beck and Max Middleton's playing are also highlights of \\"Constipated Duck\\" and \\"Scatterbrain\\", which aren't the best songs ever written but do have a lot of fantastic playing. It's far from perfect, though to its credit there's only a single weak song on the album: the endless \\"Diamond Dust\\", repetitive and with a cheesy synthesized string part that was probably intended to be breathtakingly beautiful. Yeah, that didn't work. But \\"AIR Blower\\", named after the studio it was recorded at, is kinda forgettable. Not bad or anything, but the kind of song that fades in the background when it's done, you know? But I'm willing to amend a bit of filler, because there's a lot of unforgettable material here. Along with Truth and Wired, this is an essential Jeff Beck disc.

0316113077|5.0|Ever since i started baking Elisa's recipes i've been hooked! Her cake flavors are one of a kind. The vanilla is my personal favorite although the banana and red velvet are competing for that honor. I truly love this book!!! Not only Elisa writes the recipes in a way that are easy to read, understand and mix for the home baker but she also uses weight measurements for us professional pastry chefs. The recipes are also very easy to  bake in large quantities since she gives you the volume for 9\\" pans and 1/2 sheets. I strongly recommend this book!
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|I attended her performance at the Excel Energy Center in Minneapolis, MN back in March 2007 and this was a night to never be forgotten.  Her incredible synchronization with her musicians, stunning vocal quality, dancing, and overall performance were truly one-of-a-kind.  I've seen Josh Groban live, PCD, Maroon 5, and many other incredible artists perform live and none compare to Christina Aguilera.  She's in this business for the long hall with the powerful vocals to keep her going.  Congratulations Christina and keep up the incredible work.<br />I can't wait for the DVD!
B000YABYLA|5.0|I have to admit that when I see a preview for a movie about a pregnant teenager, my first thought always goes back to conventional Lifetime TV soapers like [[ASIN:B00008MTXK Fifteen and Pregnant]] and [[ASIN:B000ASATTY Mom at Sixteen]]. However, director Jason Reitman (who proved to have a wry, ironic eye with [[ASIN:B000H0MKOC Thank You for Smoking]]) and first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody, who previously worked as a stripper and phone sex operator, have concocted a genuinely quirky, surprisingly tender dramedy that takes the clich&eacute;-ridden story idea and fleshes it out with so many recognizable idiosyncrasies and so much insightful wit that the subgenre feels reborn.<br /><br />The plot centers on a suburban Minneapolis sixteen-year old named Juno MacGuff, who finds herself pregnant after an experiment in chair-bound seduction with her shy classmate, a geeky, Tic-Tac-popping runner named Paulie Bleeker. Instead of focusing on dramatic confrontations with the parents or morphing into a diatribe on the right-to-life-or-choose debate, Reitman and Cody follow Juno's natural emotional impulses as she awkwardly attempts to figure out the best course of action to take. Things start to look promising when Juno finds a young upscale couple to adopt her baby - Vanessa is a controlling professional with perfectionist tendencies, while her husband Mark is an easy-going composer of commercial jingles, an aging Peter Pan-type whom Juno sees as a kindred spirit with a mutual fondness for rock music, slasher movies and comic books.<br /><br />What I particularly like about the movie is how it portrays Juno as someone who holds no illusion of becoming a mother and yet discovers the emotional intelligence to match her maddeningly clever smart-mouthing. In fact, I had concerns about the persistence of the slang-heavy dialogue at the outset but was relieved to find the movie settle into sharp bantering exchanges that make way for more human dimensions. As proven with [[ASIN:B000K7VHQE Little Miss Sunshine]] and [[ASIN:B000YABV9U Lars and the Real Girl]], a perfectly compatible ensemble can make all the difference with a movie as character-rich as this one. Fortunately, the cast is terrific starting with Ellen Page's prodigious turn in the title role. As a follow-up to her knockout work in [[ASIN:B000GI3KGC Hard Candy]], she is impressive in revealing a fearless vulnerability under her character's disconcerting self-possession. As Bleeker, Michael Cera nicely provides a quiet gravity in response to Juno's volatility.<br /><br />There is great work by J.K. Simmons as Juno's no-nonsense dad and especially Allison Janney as her acid-tongued, dog-loving stepmother (her verbal teardown of the patronizing ultrasound technician is classic). The surprise comes from the sturdy work by Jason Bateman, bringing palpable, almost wistful regret to Mark, and the gorgeous Jennifer Garner truly affecting in conveying Vanessa's unfulfilled state. More predictable are Olivia Thirlby as Juno's teacher-obsessed best friend Leah and Rainn Wilson in a cameo as a smart-alecky convenience store clerk. Indie folk singer Kimya Dawson composed and performs the amusing songs that bridge the seasonal changes in the story. This film is a genuine winner strongly recommended.unshine]] and [[ASIN:B000YABV9U Lars and the Real Girl]], a perfectly compatible ensemble can make all the difference with a movie as character-rich as this one.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the top 10 miniseries of all time. Flawless filmmaking and storytelling. I defy you to watch the first 15 minutes of part one and not finish it. Then I up the ante and further defy you not to immediately start watching part two right after the conclusion of part one. This is HBO--and filmmaking--at its finest. An unmitigated and unqualified 10/10.
B000Y179KO|5.0|When I decided to write a review, I had a hard time deciding which title will be more fitting.  Several came to mind: The Long Wait, A Must Buy, Still Relevant, etc. however, after hearing these superb two discs a couple of times, it became clear to me it had to reflect my thankfulness for music this good still being made.    This CD has several merits:    Most of the material sounds fresh, it doesn´t feel as if the Eagle sound just time warped forward 28 years, the arrangements suggest that the input of the various session musicians and the musical baggage of its members actually helped update the Eagles sound;    Every Eagle (as usual) sings at least a couple of songs with its own distinctive style, which makes the CD diversity interesting;    I like almost every song and these days even in a 10 song CD that is a difficult feat (highlights are Business as Usual, What I Do With My Heart, Somebody, Long Road Out of Eden, Frail Grasp of the Big Picture, Fast Company, I Dont Want To Hear Anymore).    I am an early forties guy still hooked to the musical glory years of the 70 and 80s and its pleasant that you can still find acts like Eagles, Toto (Falling In Between), Depeche Mode (Playing the Angel) or Santana (Supernatural) whose recent/last releases still feature great and relevant music.    Based on the excellent commercial response to this CD, I just hope The Eagles find the time/energy to tour so the excellent material from Long Road Out of Eden gets the DVD treatment it deserves.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Being a fan of the ship itself since I was a small girl, this movie met all of my expectations and more!  As much as I love Leo and Kate, the ship is the real star here.
B000WCDI5K|3.0|This collection of B-sides, soundtrack cuts and import-only songs holds up better than \\"Sam's Town\\" (not a favorite of mine admittedly) and despite the patchwork pedigree of the tracks, it gives fans of their past two releases plenty to enjoy....provided you did'nt purchase their past several singles. You have to wonder what The Killers must've been thinking when they relegated some of these tracks to the scrap heap in favor of what they stuck on their second album. While it's true that a few songs here get an unfavorable vocal overdub in an effort to make them conform to Brandon Flowers' new quivering singing style (Glamorous Indie Rock And Roll) the bulk of the reworking works well and \\"Leave The Bourbon On The Shelf\\" just might be one of their best songs ever! I've come to appreiciate the song \\"Sam's Town\\" more after hearing the stripped down version on Sawdust and the remix of \\"Mr. Brightside\\" places the song firmly in Violator-era Depecke Mode (for all us New Wave lovin' Hot Fuss fans). The only real misstep is the Dire Straits cover. Guys...please...get over your fascination with 70's classic rock, would'ya? Other than that, this CD is getting some heavy rotation in my car these days.

0765318741|5.0|There are allot of reviews out there toting Richard Matheson as the father of the vampire story but to be honest I only knew of him because of the upcoming film version of I Am Legend. I'm not a \\"vampire\\" enthusist by any stretch of the imagination and this is probably why I knew very little about I Am Legend.<br /><br />The story centers around Robert Neville, a normal \\"every day\\" man who travels to work with his neighbor each day. One day, there is a virus outbreak that converts everyone in the world but him into crazed, flesh seeking monsters that only come out at night. Much like the Resident Evil stories, the dead comeback, reanimated by the virus until either subjected to sunlight, effectively killing the virus or being stabbed with a stake, exposing the virus to oxygen.<br /><br />Robert embarks on a mission to understand the \\"vampire\\" virus only to rule out vampires completely in favor of a much more scientific understanding of the disease (thank god).<br /><br />In the novel, he is not a Military LT or genius scientist hellbent on curing the disease but rather a very lonely man, desperately missing his wife spending his time studying about the horrible nightmares that attack his home each night. He spends his days scouring for food, information, disposing of bodies in a fire and trying to better understand what has happened to the world, theorizing on his immunity.<br /><br />His final undoing is by that of a woman he meets and I'll leave it at that so as not to give any spoilers away.<br /><br />I saw the movie this weekend and was greatly impressed by it (nix the crappy cgi) and I expected them to take liberties over the book but was surprised to see that other than Robert Neville and the virus everything else was pretty much created for the film or greatly embellished from certian aspects of the book. So, if you liked the movie then read the book for a much different experience with a really great twist.<br /><br />On a side note, there are several other short stories included here one in particular about a little statue that comes to life I found particularlly fun to read. I mention this because I thought the entire book was I Am Legend and when I got the the afore mentioned story I quickly became confused thinking it was another chapter to I Am Legend. :)<br /><br />- Dan.short stories included here one in particular about a little statue that comes to life I found particularlly fun to read.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|Finally! The copy I have been waiting for. The original theatrical version with Harrisons commentary through it. The best version is this and if you havent seen it I suggest you do. I watched this version so many times in the eighties that my vhs tape wore out and Ive never been able to find this version again.
B000002J1S|5.0|This is my absolute favorite album of all time.  It is the ultimate \\"Stranded on a desert Island\\" album because every time I listen to it, I hear something new.  I can't wait for the 2008 Remix of it!!!!    Most reviews I see here try to explain this album and re-tell the story of the album over and over again...We all know the general idea. Let's face it, only Peter Gabriel knows what the album is truly about, and he is not here to back me up, SO I WILL NOT ANALYSE IT!  I will just explain why I love it!      The average listener of rock music often overlooks Genesis...I don't know why?  Maybe it is because they got so popular in the 80s and 90s? It really depresses me.  I feel I have been put on this earth to spread the \\"good word of Genesis\\" and remind (if not INTRODUCE) people to the earlier Genesis albums and how brilliant they were.  One friend of mine bought this album on a whim after hearing me mention it in passing and fell in love with it!    This is music to provoke thought.  It is NOT SPOONFED to you.  You have to think about it, which is why most people probably  overlook Prog rock in the fist place.  Mike Nesmith from the Monkees made a very intelligent statement once...\\"People just want to dance to music anymore,\\" they don't really care about musicianship and awe-inspiring playing!     I feel that Genesis always get slighted when Prog Rock is mentioned.  YES and Crimson and ELP always get most of the credit.  Though, they are great bands that all have their own style and respective creativity, Genesis, I always thought, were the standouts!  The playing, the drama, and the incredible personalities of this group are what make them the BEST>  I love (Bill Bruford era) YES and early King Crimson, but I don't think they can hold a candle to GENESIS.  Every Yes album sounds the same, until they went poppier, too.  I felt as though they never moved on...Close to the Edge sounds a lot like Fragile and The Yes Album; Time and a Word sounds a lot like \\"YES\\" andso on...  Each Genesis album progressed to the next level...\\"Trespass\\" sounds gothic, Nursery Cryme sounds Victorian, Foxtrot sounds majestic, Selling England sounds very classical, The Lamb is dark and brooding..., Wind and Wuthering is romantic, Abacab is stark and rough, and so on....  Each song sounds like it is placed perfectly within each Genesis album.  A track like \\"Whodunnit\\" can be compared to something like \\"The Waiting Room\\" because they are experiments in atmoshpere and sounds. Being a musician, Genesis always have fascinated me with their writing.    This album is the apex of their creativity!      As far as I am concerned, everyone should own this album and LOVE IT!  I know that is a little far fetched, but it truly is incredible music...NOT FOR THE CASUAL LISTENER>  TRUE MUSIC HEADS ONLY!!!!!    A MASTERPIECE THAT SHOULD BE PUT IN A TIME CAPSULE AND DUG UP IN 2000 YEARS and STUDIED!!!!!!!    Thanks to Genesis (Then and now - because I love EVERY ERA of Genesis, not just the Gabriel period)for making consistantly great music....I will always worship you guys!!!
B000U7169M|4.0|Stephen Hopkins directs The Reaping which is a very good supernatural thriller. Hillary Swank plays Katherine Winter who is an investigative scholar regarding paranormal events. She uncovers fraud and fake miracles. However, there are 10 biblical plagues that seem to occur in a very short period of time. The actors and special effects make The Reaping a movie that is worth seeing. There is a 20-minute stretch of non action that the director should have cut from the final version. On the bright side, Hilary Swank gives another talented performance.  Plus, the ending is spectacular. I rate this movie with 4 stars.

Her dad conned an Atlantic City casino boss out of $10,000 and for that Annabelle's mother was killed by the casino boss, Jerry Bagger.  Annabelle in revenge cons Bagger out of $40 million and so in the first of several plot lines, Jerry is after her and her team.<br /><br />In another plot line, two former CIA operatives who are now retired and living deep undercover have been killed.  Who is responsible and how is he/she finding them?<br /><br />A third plot line involves Harry Finn who has a security company that does jobs for Homeland Security testing the security in airports, Federal buildings and so on.  Finn has a wife and kids.  Finn is living a double life and trying to keep Finn the family man separate from his other self is becoming more and more difficult.<br /><br />Without giving any more away, I enjoyed how some of the plots intersect, some of the mysteries are solved and a couple new mysteries thrown in.  As always a first rate job by Baldacci at keeping it real.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I think we have to ask ourselves if we live in a country where lying about very important matters has simply become standard operating procedure.<br /><br />Michael Moore's latest film, 'Sicko,' documents the U.S. of America's slide into the realm of the dark side and should provide us a clue.  In the film an American M.D. admits that he sold his signature to a U.S. insurance company to lend credence to their denial of medical care to sick persons they had, fairly apparently, only been pretending to provide insurance.  The list of what Michael Moore discovered, when he looked into the U.S. of America's medical care system, goes on and on.  And, I hope to most of us, the picture is not a pretty one.<br /><br />I suppose that if you are the unborn great grandchild of a U.S. American CEO, who was chosen to head the company because he was the best liar available, then it all seems pretty peachy-keen.  I would hope that such a possible assessment will not remain valid.

B000P6R9RG|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out twice. I wanted to listen to it for a couple of months before I actually reviewed it. And I have to say that this album is amazing. Linkin Park's change in sound was a brilliant idea, the album starts off with wake, an instrumental that perfectly matches the atmosphere of the name of the album, it gives the feeling of something dark. Given up starts off with a guitar and a track of keys jingling and hands clapping, it has a very punk rock sound to it. The second track(Leave Out All The Rest) starts off with sampling, and has a very deep emotional meaning, it sounds very different from what Linkin Park has done before. Bleed it Out sounds very much like the old Linkin Park, Mike raps the verses, Chester screams the chorus, and for this reason, is probably the worst song on the album. Shadow of The Day is extremely different from other Linkin Park songs, but is, in my opinion, similar to the second track. What I've done is in ways similar and different to Linkin Parks old sound, it has a strong meaning, but the emotion isn't very strong, and its piano pattern at the beginning matches the atmosphere of wake. Hands Held High is possibly the best track on the album, it starts off with an organ, then a marching band type drum pattern, the verses are rapped by Mike and are full of emotion, the simple chorus of \\"amen\\" adds to the emotional effect of the song. No More Sorrow is Very much like What I've Done, it is different in the fact that its structure is different, there is more emotion in this track, but still not alot. Valentine's Day is very different sounding from their old sound, it has the same structure as Hands Held High and is full of emotoin. In between has Mike singing along to a bass, it is one of the more unique songs on the album, it's dry, repetitive lyrics do not keep it from being a truly amazing song. In pieces is a very different song, It manages to combine the anger of Linkin Park's old sound with a great amountof emotion, it also contains a simple, yet amazing guitar solo. The Little Things Give You Away is one of the best song Linkin Park has ever written it combines the best elements of the songs on the album, a guitar solo, a repeating chorus at the end, and a beat loop at the beginning, along with a soft sound throughout. Yes, some songs are paired together, it was hard to rank some of these.    here is how i ranked the songs: 1:Hands Held High, 2:The Little Things Give you away, 3:Leave Out all the Rest, Valentine's Day, 4:In Pieces, In between, 5:Given Up, wake, 6: What I've Done, No More Sorrow, 7: Bleed it Out, Shadow Of The Day. If you want to hear the best of LInkin Park, then buy this album, the only other songs that truly stand out by them do not compare to the amazing emotion and sound brought on by this album, Linkin Park has finally made a record that I want to listen to the whole way through for more than a month. This album is easily my favorite in my cd collection.

0525950079|5.0|It's amazing how Ken Follett can make life in this period so interesting.  I was totally captured by Pillars of the Earth and now am again with this book.  I'm most of the way through it and I don't want it to end.  My daughter also requested this book as a Christmas present.  I happily oblige.
B000I0QL82|4.0|This is a classic film and has many Great Old Christmas Songs...Great dancing, fine acting... It is pretty festive and everything but the cover makes it appear that it might be in color.. and it isn't and there are some pretty insensitive scenes with musical numbers in black face.    I know it is part of our history (stereotyping and racism as accepted popular entertainment), but it made me cringe nonetheless...    If i had it to do over, I would have bought White Christmas which is a bit more suited to my modern sensibilities.
006112429X|2.0|I loved Lionel Shriver's book The Post-Birthday World for its imaginative use of split timelines, its character development, and its exploration of ambivalence, indecision, and consequences. This book, although exploring some of the same ground, does not have so much to hold a reader's attention. While the prose is well-written, the characters are all seen through the warped lens of the (possibly) delusional narrator, and that narrator drones on and on, repeating laments about past decisions and current ambiguities that become quite old quite fast.  It is true that the author might be making just such a point, that this self-centered and over-the-edge mother is as much to blame for the tragedy as her bad-seed offspring; but the major points of this books, and its entire plotline, could fit into less than 100 pages...it is just too repetitive and unrelenting, especially for such a bleak topic.
B000O178BY|4.0|I can't say I hated this cd because it is a really good piece of work, but seeing as my favorite cd is The Fragile, I was probably bound to not like this cd as much as the other halos.
B000WQW988|5.0|I saw this show on tv when it first aired and I really enjoyed it. After the tragic demise of Kurt Cobain, I still enjoyed his music but was never sure if I'd ever feel confortable to see him on the screen again. Wrong! Enough time has passed. The video is right on and fresh. It was just as good if not better the second time around. It is well worth buying. It's about time it was released.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|Can't think of a more compelling live DVD. Always had a modest appreciation for Nightwish, but this DVD takes them to the top of my favorites list. The operatic vocals of Tarja Turunen combined with the keyboard and rock scores a bit like Rammstein.

0743268091|4.0|What a phenomenal book!  To dispute, with logic, examples, reason, truth, the mythology of religions with such erudition is so timely.  Moderates, fundamentalists, and the faithful of all stripes will feel defensive and hostile to such thinking, but author Sam Harris neatly calls us to question faith - \\"an act of knowledge that has a low degree of evidence.\\"  I read this book with great interest as a philosophical argument against religion, but thankfully found it to be more than that.  Harris lays waste to the false claims that the religious among us should be able to accept each other as equally valid no matter what faith they follow, to the notion that Islam and Christianity are religions of peace, and writes about the relationship between blind faith (and it's all blind) and world devastation.  There is a lot of humor behind the velocity of his enlightened premise, so the book isn't just a dry, godless, souless glimpse into our disregard for the \\"facts of this world out of deference to the God who lurks\\" in our imaginations.  Challenging, provocative, belongs on the reading lists of every school of higher learning.
B000002GB9|5.0|As a teen, I loved this record.  I went to their concerts, bought t-shirts, and wrote their names all over my folders in High School.  I have always considered them one of my all-time favorite groups.      Then, with kids, the CD's we played in the car for many years revolved around music more geared to their ages.  However, I am pleased to say that I now have my kids requesting to listen to this CD!  My kids think I'm cool because I went to Styx concerts, too.    This CD was the group's big \\"breakthrough\\" album.  It shows their true song-writing abilities, as well as musical talents.  It has great guitar riffs, as well as haunting melodies that stick in your head.  Even their lyrics are great.  The song that was most played on the radio was, \\"Come Sail Away.\\"  When I saw them in concert, the crowd wanted, \\"Miss America.\\"  When they came out of for the encore, it was expected that they would play that song.  When they didn't people chanted for the song.  The next tour, they added that song!  It was highly popular.      Tommy Shaw's guitar playing as well as singing are so great.  James Young has such a distinct voice, and wrote songs that enhanced it well.  Dennis DeYoung has such a talent with keyboards and puts his whole heart into every song.  The brothers who played bass and drums were under-appreciated during the 70's, but their talent is much more appreciated with hindsight.    All these years later, this album is still so good, and great to listen to. My kids love it (range from 12 to 18 years old), and I still love it.    I--very highly--recommend this CD.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|An excellent movie for the whole family. It has some sensitive matters about how slaves were imported to the various countries. It has a love story and historical features. My family loved it. I love it!
B000UD0ESA|4.0|Blade Runner is one of my all-time favorite movies and the pioneer for so many science fiction films that have borrowed from it.    I loved the first version I saw years ago and own on tape. So I was disappointed with the latest final cut.  While the picture quality is outstanding, I missed the voiceover narrative that makes Deckard the central character and lets us see the story though his mind and emotions. This time there's hardly any distinction between him and the replicants which I suspect is what the director wanted -- to blur distinctions between humans and replicants as much as possible.    I miss Deckard's musing about why Roy let him live and I liked the getaway on the train and the notion expressed by Harrison Ford rather than Olmos, that we don't know when Rachel or anyone else's number will be up. And I agree that for some odd reason we have less sympathy for the replicants in this version.    Too bad they have to keep tinkering with a masterpiece.  Bess H

B000TGCR3I|5.0|THIS IS A FIRST-OF-A-KIND MOVIE, A TURNING POINT IN ANIMATION OR ANY FILM. ITS FUSION OF WESTERN AND JAPANESE CREATIVE MINDS HAS PRODUCED A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. IN ONE VIEWING It HAS BECOME ONE OF MY TOP-TEN MOVIES EVER.    It is many-layered, and each viewing turned up more and more understanding and stronger feelings. I probably have yet to get all its metaphors and references; but I could feel them. It's the most elegantly-done anime I've ever seen; the most-sophisticated yet most essential, accessible and memorable.     Viewers of any age or background will enjoy and benefit from it.   It's art, really, perhaps starting a whole new movie genre.    (My appreciation/enthusiasm for this film makes me sound as if I'm raving, high on something; if so, it's this movie. However, whenever, you can see it, see it.    (Tekkonkinkreet is a classic. 2007 had PAPRIKA, which I think is a fine effort; but, Tekkonkinreet has a universal sensibility as well as the most well- done graphics. But because of this anime, 2007 will be seen as a turning point.    (When I graduated high school in (glerk!) 1958, my year-book class prophesy was I'd be seen putting Walt Disney out of business in 20 years. Since then I'd worked in Hollywood in animation among other genre, and it has been a life-long turn-on for me. Tekkonkinkreet has doubled the joy I've found in animation. See it, you'll see. And I have no doubt you'll see it again and again.)    Lastnote: After seeing the movie I zipped back to Amazon and order   the graphic novel from which it came. I'm eagerly awaiting it.
B000M4RG4C|2.0|[[ASIN:B000M4RG4C Flags of Our Fathers (Full Screen Edition)]]  Not a very good action movie---although it is a factual representation of what happened to the brave men who planted the flag on that far off island, in WWII. Very boring in spots. NOT an action type war movie

B00005JMYI|5.0|This is the first movie with Will Ferrell where he doesn't seem to be Will Ferrell. Despite the goofy mockery of the film itself, he's actually managed to create a stand alone character. Ron Burgundy is fully fleshed (if shallow and stupid) but hey, he's also very funny.<br /><br />The humor is stupid and directed at the main character. Is similar to Zoolander. Definitely one to own.

0143038419|5.0|Having read a few of Oprah's recommendations, I wasn't too eager to read this, but I was attending a class at my church and this seemed to go along with the topic.  I thought the Eat section great, but then Pray turned out even better, and by the time I got to Love, I was giving the book to my friends to read.  I have always been a believer in God, and much of what Elizabeth experienced rings true.  Certainly God is love, and if we all realized that, the world would be a better place.    I'm Italian, find yoga a much needed escape, and my faith was boosted in the pages of this book.  Guess it met all my needs.
B000UJ48UO|4.0|First up a commentary about the qualty of the Blu-ray presentation then for those that are interested an analysis of Kubrick's film. The Blu-ray presentation is nearly flawless with a rich looking, terrific presentation with sharp images and an accurate representation of the color scheme of the film.<br /><br />Note: Keep in mind that this film was ALWAYS grainy and Kubrick intentionally went with a \\"flat\\" look for the lighting of the film. However, an earlier edition of the film used an older HD master that didn't do the film any favors and had issues with the MPEG2 compression technology not being able to do an adequate job of keeping up with the shifting images (particularly in the latter half of the film. This probably isn't the disc to \\"knock your socks off\\" about Blu-ray because of the way it was shot. The new edition, however, accurately reflects the \\"look\\", textures and feel of the original film much more accurately than ANY other version to date.<br /><br />The extras which include a commentary track by the cast (although curiously Matthew Modine is absent), is extremely good providing bits of detail about the production of the film. As Vincent D'onofrio points out Kubrick would probably be very unhappy if he was alive and knew there was a commentary track on the film. Kubrick wanted his films to be accepted without commentary or observations about those involved in the production (much like Spielberg)but it does help to have these observations to provide a context about the making of the film. As with the DVD we get a number of terrific featurette \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" that provides insight into the making of the film and themes that Kubrick shapes.<br /><br />How does this compare to the DVD? It looks better of course. How does this compare to the HD-DVD? Since both used the same encoding, it should look roughly the same but I haven't had time to do a side-by-side comparison. I can't compare this to the previous Blu-ray edition because I don't have it.<br /><br />Any film is truly about the era the film was made in whether it be a period drama, science fiction or romantic comedy set in another time it captures the essence of that era, comments on it through the actions of the characters and behaviors and even the themes itself. This was true of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"Jaws\\" as much as it is about \\"Citizen Kane\\" and \\"Vertigo\\". Great films, however, manage to also transcend the era about which they were made because they manage to touch on much more sweeping, grand (or in this case intimate) themes pursuing the essence of what it is to be human. \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" Stanley Kubrick's penultimate film fits in this category. It's as much about the Reagan/Bush era as it is about the Vietnam/60's experience and manages to be both clinical and intimate touching on the small moments that altered these individual's lives unlike the epic \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (to which this film is a terrific companion piece).<br /><br />The story is, essentially, broken into two sections equally powerful and satiric; the first half is set on Paris Island where new recruits are indoctrinated into the military way--their identities are symbolically taken away as they are \\"reborn\\" with their heads shaved, they are given a new set of rules and codes to live by and are \\"reborn\\" to kill. This section focuses on the tools these men are also given to be both killing machines and survival with the hopes that they can retain some sense of humanity as well.<br /><br />The second half focuses on their experience in Vietnam itself where they've \\"grown up\\" into the hunters they were retrained to be. Kubrick manages to be both satiric and, surprisingly, allows us the audience to connect with the characters wayward humanity in scenes where they interact. Most of the what's left of these people are the surface and underneath when unleased are deadly creatures as dark, base and cynical as the astronaunts in \\"2001\\" are intellectual, detacted and curious. It'sa fascinating companion piece to Kubrick's films \\"Paths of Glory\\", \\"Dr. Strangelove\\", \\"2001\\" and \\"Clockwork\\" all of which touch on the same themes.s \\"Paths of Glory\\", \\"Dr. Strangelove\\", \\"2001\\" and \\"Clockwork\\" all of which touch on the same themes.
B000M4RG42|5.0|Flags Of Our Fathers  DVD<br /><br />Flags Of Our Fathers  directed by Clint Eastwood and produced by Clint Eastwood is based on true events surrounding the Battle for Iwo Jima during World War II.  It follows the activities of two marines and one sailor who supposedly helped raise the U.S. Flag on a  hill on Iwo Jima, a picture of which was shown in just about every newspaper in America.  A signal of success after one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific campaign. The  \\"Powers that be\\"  eventually turn the picture into a publicity stunt to raise money for the war.<br /><br />Warning, contains some blood and guts.  Not recommended for young children.  It is recommended for those who want to see what war is like up close and personal.<br /><br />Gunner  December, 2007

1592332803|5.0|\\"The Joy of Vegan Baking\\" by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau is an essential cookbook for anyone interested in egg- and dairy-free baking. The recipes are easy to understand, even for beginning bakers, the ingredients are accessible, and Colleen covers many of the delicious comfort foods that you don't have to give up when removing eggs and dairy from the diet. The layout of the book is gorgeous and easy to read, and the different indices (sorted by ingredients, seasons and holidays/celebrations) are appreciated. The cornbread is moist and flavorful with a great crumb, the peanut butter chocolate bars bring back fond childhood memories, the peanut butter cookies with chocolate chips are rich, sweet and chewy and the pumpkin cheesecake with pecan crust is an appreciated departure from the standard pumpkin pie during the holidays. This is certainly not a health food book, but the food is definitely good for the soul. These recipes will make any skeptic a believer in vegan baked goods. Great job, Colleen!
1401302378|5.0|While most good business books will offer you a gem or two that, if cultivated, could help you to become more efficient, effective or affluent; it is rare indeed to find a book that opens the doors (and the readers mind) to a whole new way to look at business and commerce in the future. If you are or will be involved in the marketing of a prouct in the next twenty years this book is a must read. There is no doubt in my mind that many will take the information in this book and leverage it into millions of dollars.

B000VS6P9Q|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of new takes on Bob Dylan songs. Although I am of a certain age that would know most (but not the very earliest) of the original Dylan songs in their original contexts, I do not worship the canon nor believe \\"The Times They Are a Changin' \\" was inscribed on stone tablets. \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is my favorite album of his, so that should give you some idea of where I'm coming from.    But the comments here bring up an interesting dichotomy that resembles the  classicist/romantic split that often comes up when performed art is discussed. The classicists tend toward the \\"Dylan does Dylan best,\\" or even \\"only Dylan can do Dylan correctly.\\" The romantic would throw the doors open to anyone performing a Dylan work in any manner he or she wishes. Of course, most people fall somewhere in the middle. Does anyone not appreciate The Byrds' version of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man?\\"    This isn't just a technical exercise, but rather has practical implications. Classical music pieces have become something akin to (pre-Modern) museum pieces. The vast majority of the classical music audience wants to hear Beethoven's 9th Symphony performed \\"correctly.\\" Granted, conductors and musicians interpret the classics during performances, but within a narrow range. Of course, there are exceptions, such as the bright young violinist Carla Kihlstedt, who is building an amazing repertoire across several musical genres.    Do we want Bob Dylan's work to always be performed \\"correctly?\\" In 200 years (yes, I think his work will still be performed then and later) will we want to dress up to hear Dylan performed correctly in a concert hall by a performer in period costumes?     There will be a place for this type of performance, but keeping the songs fresh is mandatory. Without reinterpretations from contemporary performers, any music gradually becomes relevant only as history. When songs become museum pieces they lose their vitality and wither away, eventually known only to connoisseurs and members of the academy.     People may not like all of the interpretations here, but none of the performances sounds like it was \\"phoned in.\\" Most of the artists here have probably lived with these songs during their careers and respect them greatly.  The group of musicians making up \\"the house band\\" also provide a coherence that is lacking in many multi-artist compilations.    All-in-all, an outstanding collection, as long as you don't expect a completely deferential approach to the material.

B00005NVDF|4.0|This movie is one of Woody's best and will appeal to people who have insecurities, are neurotic, doubt themselves and become rigid with worry when around the opposite sex -  basically 95% of the human race feel like that at some stages in life. It will also appeal if you just want a good old belly laugh by an original and off-kilter comedy without any profanities or over the top in-your-face comedies that come out today.<br /><br />Allen Felix's (Woody)wife leaves him because he fails to satisfy her. She wants to 'live', participate in life and be a 'doer' and not a 'watcher', to run through Europe on a motorcycle, go dancing and skiing. She also doesn't dig him physically -  then tells him for \\"gods sake don't take it personally\\"!  After some prodding from best friends Dick and Linda, he decides to start dating again.<br /><br />He's not real comfortable in his own skin and feels the need to impress a girl immediately, like putting out his 100 yard dash track record medal(that he payed 20 dollars for) putting on the proper mood music, as well as getting top notch advice on handling chicks via Humphrey Bogart (Jerry Lacy) which is a hoot. After many dating disasters he learns a painful, yet invaluable life lesson that to have any chance of success finding love and be successful he has to accept who he is - faults and all. I won't give the plot away, only that it is because of these dating disasters that he ends up finding love,  ultimately though he finds himself.  After all, real love starts with self love.<br /><br />It does tend to run out of steam half way through, and I think this could be because it starts with such gusto that it had no place to go but lull once the sight and date gags are over. Still it's  a fine movie and one most people will find amusing.with such gusto that it had no place to go but lull once the sight and date gags are over.

B000001IPL|5.0|This is the album that got me into punk rock.  While this is a bit on the outskirts, it's definitely a great gateway record.  The drums are incredible, the guitar is often playful and hard rockin', and Dexter's scratchy voice is a perfect fit with the rest of the band.  \\"Nitro\\" and \\"Self-Esteem\\" are especially great.  I would definitely recommend buying this CD.  It's worth it.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Make no mistake about it.  This is exactly what Star Trek fans, like myself, have been waiting for.   The Star Trek phenomenon speaks for itself.  The offspring of the original show--the movies and the series--have been able to keep pace with effects technology. But, the original Star Trek had become an embarrassment.  But, now, that's all changed.  Every old effect is gone.  They have been completely replaced, including the opening credits (with a newly recorded theme, to boot).  This replacement has not \\"butchered\\" the series, as one reviewer complained.  Nor do the new effects need to be compared to the effects of other Star Trek shows.  The fear of re-vamping the old effects to modern standards was whether they would stand out too much compared to the rest of the show.  And that is why the new effects are a happy compromise between today and yesterday. The crew at Paramount has done an amazing job of modernizing all the effects, while staying loyal to the original look.  The effects are not so modern as to make them look out of place, yet they do not look old or cheesy.  There are no longer any \\"stock\\" shots of the Enterprise, that are recycled from episode to episode. There are new points of view of the Enterprise, and I get a much better sense of how large the ship actually is.  And there are plenty of surprising effects that were never in the original show.  It is, quite simply, breath-taking.    In 40 years, I have watched every episode countless times.  But never have I been so excited to watch them as I do now.  Besides the new effects, the entire look of the show has been restored--frame by frame.  Scratches, blemishes, skin tones, and lighting contrast have all been fixed.  Along with the space shots, there are marvelous enhancements to city scapes, planet surfaces, and even Sulu's chronometer is no longer made of those stupid-looking plastic wheels.  No, the sound is not perfect, but it's better than what it used to be.  Yes, the packaging is horrible.My set was broken when it arrived.  But I don't care.  Yes, it's a bit too expensive and will probably come down in price eventually.  But I don't care.  I have what I have always wanted...Star Trek the way it should be, the way it always deserved to be.  It is obvious that this restoration was done with love and reverence.  Sure, Paramount is going to make money for this. But they deserve it.  And, as a fan of Star Trek, you deserve to see the show the way it was intended.  You can now let your kids see the show without being too embarrassed.  After all, there are still the same charming foibles to see:  the sets, the costumes, and some rather silly episodes.  If you love Star Trek as much as I do--and I know you do or you wouldn't be reading this--then purchase this DVD set and go where you have always wanted to go before!
B00000J7JO|4.0|Californication is a good album and certainly worth whatever you pay for it (assuming it's under twenty bucks).  If you like the Chili Peppers at all this is a must-own along with One Hot Minute.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|Great action.  Good plot.  Cool villians.  A little more sentimentality than I expected.  There are too many tear-eyed scenes.  First Spiderman had the right blend of sentimentality, heart and action.  The second one dealt with some angst, overcoming and great action.  The third put too much sentimentality.  There are legitimate scenes that call for the tears, but the film was rank with weepy-ville.  Peter Parker is crying.  Sandman is crying.  May Jane is Crying.  Harry Osborune is crying.  Puh-lease.    Highly entertaining but borderlining on sappy.
B000002TQV|5.0|This album is musical perfection from start to finish.  I think it's their best album by far and is typically highly underrated.  People are so caught up in OK Computer and Kid A, but The Bends is far more inventive.  Buy this CD!!  It's worth every penny.
B000W1V5VU|2.0|Unlike the first and second movie, this film takes forever to get to the heist.  Too much talking.  Too much exposition.  We spend more time watching the main characters have personal conversations.  And the movie's premise is primarily about revenge and loyalty which is okay but just doesn't carry the same motivational umph as a dazzling prize to be taken.  Plus, the movie tried to stuff a bunch of the characters from the last two movies into this one.  Is it Ocean's 100?  Despite being unified by heist, the Ocean characters seem scattered and involved in their own personal agendas.    Skip it.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I am a huge fan of friends and I am delighted that I purchased it. I would highly recommend the complete friends collection.  It is also good value for money.
B000PC8AFU|3.0|This disc does not focus on Stevie Ray Vaughan's music, but rather Stevie Ray Vaughan's musicianship. These cuts are all in guest appearances on other artist's tracks. The Vaughan tone is easily recognizable and some tracks, such \\"Albert's Shuffle,\\" are almost a head cutting contest. It is not the overall rocked up Texas blues experience that his studio albums were but it's definitely a look for any SRV fan.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Amazingly, this extended version is meant to complement the 2-disk DVD release that came out years ago. They do not rehash bonus material from the original DVD release (beyond integrating some of deleted scenes). In fact, there is a new commentary track, new scenes (from newly discovered footage), and most importantly over three hours of high quality documentaries on the making of Gladiator that provide much, much more insight into the making of this movie than we have ever seen before. The bonus material alone is worth the price. Stop reading this and order it!
B000WJR46W|5.0|If your a SLY fan, you must have this HD-DVD. You thought you enjoyed   Rambo 2 on regular dvd?? think again.......This is the best definition  possible with the picture so clean, you could swear it was filmed yesterday. You can see the gleam of the sweat on Sly's face, more definition, and more details on the characters faces, clothing and backround. 1080P is the best picture out compared to regular dvd's (420p).  Thers' only one way to experience all 3 Rambo's.......and thats on  HD-DVD!!!!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Wow, this is an awesome disc!  Alter Bridge is at least as good if not better than Creed (at least in my humble opinion).  These guys are the real deal.  Standout tracks include Come To Life, Brand New Start, Coming Home, Rise Today, Blackbird, and Watch Over You.  But the whole album rocks.  Mark's riffs rock as always but there is a new depth and feeling that shows his growth as a musician as well.  The singer has a great voice, too.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Season Three of \\"Veronica Mars\\" is often panned by critics and fans alike.  I start my review on that note not because I plan to dispel claims of a decrease in quality (creator Rob Thomas addresses these issues on the special features without dismissing them) but to let the fans of \\"Veronica Mars\\" know that they have absolutely nothing to worry about.  This is classic V. Mars.    Veronica Mars, a show very centered on the high school setting, easily survives something that has killed countless shows:  The shift to college.  Hearst College is a great new location for the majority of the action of the series, giving us many new and interesting sets and a variety of new characters.  Though the show may suffer from too much focus on said new characters (namely Piz, a true tool) instead of established favorites (Wallace catches it the worst here), the lost points are gained back by the strength of the series.  Kristen Bell consistently giving a stellar performance as the titular Veronica.  Usually--I know this is true for a lot of people--the most captivating characters are the supporting ones.  However, Veronica is simply the best character the series has to offer and that's saying a lot, as the characterization in this series is almost always flawless.  With characters like Logan, Keith Mars, Dick Casablancas, Wallace, and Weevil, one can't go wrong.    Changes were made (due to pressure from the Network), most notably the shift of the usual format of a season-long arc carried out through mostly standalone episodes to a very different kind of set up.  The season is instead divided into three different mystery arcs.  The first few episodes focus on a rapist on the Hearst campus, the next revolving around a classic whodunnit murder mystery, and the final five episodes (the weakest of the series) are essentially standalones.  They function well enough as standalones, but the strength of the series has always been in it's story arcs.    Another plus about this season is the fact that Disc Six is packed with previews.  We get the never-before-seen pitch for what Season Four of Veronica Mars would have been (which never came to fruition, thanks to the idiocy of television executive Les Moonves) and more extras than you will know what to do with.  It is truly a shame that this intelligent series was cancelled, as it was easily one of the best shows I have ever seen.    9/10
B000002UA7|5.0|This album was my introduction to Kate Bush.  I heard it in my friend's mother's car and could not stop laughing.  The songs were bizarre and this woman's voice was the strangest thing I'd ever heard.  We struggled to contain our laughter for the whole car ride.      Fast forward 2 years.  On a whim, I found the same CD in a used bin in a store and bought it, just for a laugh. I was blown away when I put on some headphones to give it a listen for the first time in years. The chorus of Wuthering Heights practically drove me mad with its intense odd rhythms and frighteningly pretty melody.  I soon found something unique and beautiful in each song that followed, and immediately went back out into the cold and back into the CD store to buy some more Kate Bush.  I got the Dreaming and Hounds of Love, and I can truly say that Kate Bush became my favorite musician of all time overnight.      This is a very good starting point for Kate, but it really only shows a glimpse of her work. She has many, many better songs than a lot of the ones offered here, but I guess it is quite a challenge to assemble a Best Of album for an artist like Kate.  Start here, give it many spins while wearing headphones, and you'll hear what so many other people hear.  Then it's just a matter of going out and buying all her other CD's.  You won't regret it.
1594489505|5.0|Very enlightening about the Afghan culture as well as inspirational to women who are abused and have had their self esteem stripped from them.
B000OY8NII|5.0|So, what would happen if you had a secret town, populated soley by science geeks and genius', and gave them the freedom to create and invent what ever they wanted with an unlimited budget? Throw in a US marshal with an average IQ of 111 and you'd have Eureka!    I cannot reiterate how good this show is! Not only is it intelligent, it is so very funny, and totally original.  Excellent viewing!
0374105235|5.0|It's hard not to have a different perspective on your own life while reading this book.  Ishmael Beah's story is so tragic, tumbling from one low point to another, new, lower point so many times that you just have to stop and be thankful for what you have.    Beah tells the story of growing up in a village in Sierra Leone and how the outbreak of civil war turns his life and the whole social fabric of the country upside down.  Beah's storytelling is compelling and his writing pulls you quickly through his tale.      While everyone knows that war is terrible and tragic, Beah emphasizes a couple of points about his experiences that I'm unaccustomed to seeing and I think they are important insights.      First, Beah really shows how the war in Sierra Leone destroyed the country's culture, causing people to distrust and mistreat one another out of mutual fear.  Several times, before becoming a soldier, Beah was captured and threatened with death by villagers who feared he was a rebel soldier.      Second, Beah focuses in on the mental evolution of a child who becomes a soldier and the ways the military brainwashes them.  As a soldier, Beah's life becomes a stew of drugs, Rambo movies and merciless violence.  In his writing, Beah conveys the sense of a human being becoming broken and emotionally dead.  It is terribly disturbing and yet important to understand.    This is a hard book to read and yet almost impossible to set down.  It makes you what causes the lives of people living in this world to be so tragically different.  Very highly recommended.
0307387151|3.0|I was inspired to read the book when I saw the trailer for the film. It sounded like an interesting plot: younger sister sees sister doing she doesn't understand, World War Two battle, and love. However, unlike a lot of other people on Amazon, I found the writing to be pretentious and overdone, the characters unbelievable, and the \\"twist\\" to be completely obvious from the first moment you meet that character. It takes two hundred pages to get to the event for which the atonement is for. And no, I don't really think Ian McEwan is a master of psychology as the back of my book states. I didn't really get behind any of the characters motivations. I believe the editor should have encouraged McEwan to take out the first two hundred pages, which are told mostly through the incredibly obnoxious and annoying thirteen year old version of Briony, and the last fifty or so pages where the heavy handed attempt at showing the reader not to trust the narrator is completely unnecessary. With those sections gone, this is a great book. The war and hospital scenes come completely alive. Briony grows into an interesting, sympathetic character (unlike her earlier self which I repeatedly wanted to give a good spanking to). I really truly felt Robbie's endurance, anger, and desperation in the war scenes.     My advice to the reader is, don't buy the book new or at all. Find it used or go to the library. Push yourself through the first boring, annoyingly frustrating two hundred pages and you will be rewarded with good writing, excellent imagery, and an engrossing narrative.
0441172717|5.0|I read Dune for the first time when I was 21. I loved it and went on to read the rest of the saga through Chapterhouse. The series has been a corner stone of my literary exploits. While I rate this story at a solid five stars, there is not much more I can say about this book that has not already been said.     Never the less, this story is everything that a reader could possibly want in any fiction, whether science, fantasy, or otherwise.     Even though this book falls into the \\"Science Fiction\\" Category, this story is so much more than fantastic space battles, cool gadgetry and futuristic scapes that encompass much that is \\"Science\\" fiction....This book is a story of love, betrayal, intrigue, personal trial, and triumph against overwhelming odds all set about 20,000 years into our future.      There is much food for thought with this book and those that follow it.     For any Star Wars fan, read this book. This book was no doubt where Lucas got his ideas. Star Wars borrowed so much from it, yet failed to give credit where credit is due.    This book should be required reading in any high school English curriculum.
0375847227|5.0|I picked up this up at book store and after reading a few pages decided to buy it. Its not common without anybody's reccomendation to simply pick up a great book, but this time it absolutely happened. It is definitely the best fantasy I've ever read. The story is unpredictable with deep and complex characters. I would agree with some of the other reviews that despite the fact that the story's two main protagonists are pre-teens, the book is no Harry Potter and seems to be aimed at older audiences.

B000IOLZZW|3.0|This was the first HD DVD I purchased to watch on my new HD DVD player.  What a disappointment!  I love this movie but the quality was mediocre even when compared to standard definition DVDs like Jurassic Park III and The Incredibles.  That plus the lack of extras makes me wish I had purchased the regular DVD.
B00004Y548|5.0|Sure, if I don't own this, then I don't know about the *COMPLETE* packaging, but not many people are...well, not crazy, but...well, *FORTUNATE* enough to have 45 bucks, just laying around to spend on a release that offers *TWO* new songs. Call me crazy but...<br /><br />It's very, very mellow.<br /><br />Anyway, at first, none of the songs really stood out...<br /><br />But flash forward 7-8 months, and this is quite a nice, relaxing, and very, very soothing alternative CD.<br /><br />And Chris Martin's voice for the most part, fits right in!<br /><br />My favorite songs are:<br /><br />Don't Panic<br />High Speed<br />Sparks<br />Trouble (nice piano)<br />Everything's Not Lost<br /><br />I now own all 3 of Coldplay's albums. I think that this album is there very, very best, and they expanded their sound, to reach the masses with [[ASIN:B000069AUI A Rush of Blood to the Head]]. It was nearly as good, but less unique than this CD. [[ASIN:B0006L16N8 X&Y]] was most definitely the weakest link.<br /><br />But all of the CDs have at least 4 inspiring tracks on them.<br /><br />I really like the upbeat numbers that they do; Clocks, Daylight, Speed Of Sound, Fix You and Square One are amongst my favorites!<br /><br />This CD should be owned by most alternative music fans. As a MATTER OF FACT, do your friend a favor, and spread some love this Christmas by buying them this! They will love its mellow feel. It's indescribable!! Seriously. It's so lovely, that I'm at a BIG loss of words.<br /><br />I don't know if I've said this already, but when I initially purchased this from Best Buy for 13 bucks, and got it home, I was thinking, \\"This doesn't stand out much.\\" But these days, it's definitely THE BEST alternative CD I own. It's perfection. You know they've found something special when the skit on the album perfectly blends into the next song.<br /><br />So if You've had a hard day at work, kick off your shoes and socks, turn the damn phone OFF, and pop this into your CD/DVD player. Smoke something nice, get a cappuccino, and just L-I-S-T-E-N. Most of all, R-E-L-A-X.<br /><br />I have no regrets buying this one.<br /><br />5 stars.ts buying this one.    5 stars.

B000VLE3IS|3.0|Are you a 13 year old? Then pick this new compilation up, because it's the best sounding Led Zeppelin CD presently available (remastering by Jerry Shirley, formerly of Humble Pie - which I find just a little ironic - and Jimmy Page, former guitarist for The Firm).  As for the rest of us, maybe if we Just Say No they'll reissue the band's nine (that's eight plus a posthumous set of outtakes) studio albums in remastered form for next Christmas. It's been well over a decade, now, since the first catalog upgrade (which replaced those late '80s CDs). They'll probably reissue the catalog anyway, what with the buzz surrounding the recent one-off (?) reunion at an Ahmet Ertegun charity gig in London. Ertegun, who co-founded Atlantic Records back in 1947 and was a record executive whose passion for music, matched with his extraordinary charm, business acumen, and taste for the high life puts him in a category of one, sold his interest in the label a few years ago, but died the way he might have wanted, after falling down at a 2006 Rolling Stones concert in New York, at the age of 83.   In the past 15 years we have seen Led Zeppelin (who were once considered \\"above\\" releasing singles, let alone greatest hits packages) issue what now seems a rather useless 3-CD boxed set (with a mere three rare tracks, if memory serves), followed by \\"Boxed Set 2\\" (the rest of their studio tracks, plus one rarity!), \\"Remasters\\" (a boxette, two discs of the best from the box, I suppose, and a \\"bonus\\" interview disc!), another box, this time the \\"complete studio albums\\" (finally!) packaged, unfortunatly, in cardboard sleeves guaranteed to scratch the discs. All this expensive cardboard was followed by two volumes of \\"Early\\" and \\"Late\\" material later in the '90s. And now, after a couple of genuinely worthy items (the BBC set, the \\"How The West Was Won\\" live retrospective, and \\"DVD\\") we have the so called \\"Motherlode\\"...     Why? I mean, when bands like the Stones or Led Zep issue too many repackages they Muddy the Waters and confuse newbies wondering where to begin collecting a band's work. Let's get those studio albums remastered, since digital sound has certainly improved since 1994. Instead, buy a Muddy Waters collection, or the new Bo Diddley set, \\"I'm A Man: Complete Chess Recordings 1955 - 58\\", or \\"The Definitive Howlin Wolf\\". And if you own a turntable, a real good deal is the Classic Records label's exquisite vinyl remasters (from around 4 or 5 years back)  of the complete LZ catalog - lovingly, painstakingly mastered by the legendary Bernie Grundman, they all sound warm, detailed, and utterly fresh on a decent system, superior to the '94 CDs currently available. And the packages are on high quality stock, capturing the graphic as well as the sonic details of the original vinyl albums (i.e. the circular thingy from \\"III\\", the bag that held \\"In Through The Out Door\\", etc), only better. I would say \\"II\\" and \\"Presence\\" are especially revelatory in terms of inner detail and overall impact. If you're a fan, it's well worth the investment. And maybe we'll have the CDs under all of our trees for NEXT Christmas.
1881273156|5.0|I was more than excited to read this book when I found out it was on the list for our final assignment. I have always wanted to dive into his five love languages after learning about them at the internship in Texas (The Honor Academy). Chapman is world known and qualified to let his voice be heard. Many marriages were saved because of these series of books and I am honored to have read them. It has changed my perspective on how I view relationships and has definitely proved to work. I always look for ways people receive love and am able to bless their lives because of it. Thank you to Gary for his service in writing this book!
0143038419|5.0|I don't read self help books.  I don't read religious books.  I do not like people preaching to me about their feelings about God or salvation or what I should do to be a better person.  I don't like cliche, feel good pseudo evangelicals or Tony Robbins type motivators.  I loved this book because Elizabeth Gilbert is a real person with real problems.  Some people reviewed this book poorly because they felt that her experiences, ie: her marriage troubles and personal crises, were minor and trivial.  She wasn't sick, she had no major tragedies, didn't escape a husband who was beating her.  She's intelligent, healthy, wealthy, with ample opportunities in life.  This is just exactly what I loved about it, and about her.  A real person with real feelings about the mundane, difficult things in life went out and had these amazing experiences and wrote about them in a very relatable, easy to read, non preachy way.  I am so easily offended by people's religious feelings, call me right or wrong, and here I sat reading through a book about a person's search for God and spirituality, and I found it beautiful.  She doesn't judge, she doesn't push a particular view.  She is very open minded and you can't help but feel that if everyone took her view on religion and spirituality in general, the world would be quite a peaceful place.  In short, I laughed, I cried, I knew JUST how she felt in some cases, many cases even, I admired her and wanted to hug her and just maybe be NEAR her. I was able to take some things and apply them to my life, and aspire to do more things.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what a real woman experienced when trying to live a better life and who enjoys a well written, witty piece of writing.
1594489505|5.0|After reading \\"The Kite Runner\\" I looked forward to reading the next book by this author and I was not disappointed.    It was excellent and I think I enjoyed it more than \\"The Kite Runner\\" as it was from a woman's perspective and really brought home what life in Afghanistan has been like for women over the years.  A great read!  I alternated between reading the book and listening to it on a CD when I was busy in the kitchen.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael is one of the best male vocalists of my generation...<br />I can say that with conviction as I have seen him live, in concert many times...<br /><br />Michael has managed to make each track on this album his own.<br />By doing so, he has brought Jazz music back to the forefront of modern music.  No easy task, I know. I love the fact that Michael is not trying to be Frank or Bobby or Dean. Michael is Michael and that is plenty for me...
B000059LGC|4.0|For some reason, I always thought that \\"Death on the Nile\\" was a marginal Agatha Christie adaptation, one that certainly paled in comparison to the great \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\", which was produced some five years earlier.  So I never bothered to see it.  Well, I finally caught up with the movie on DVD, and, boy, was I wrong.  \\"Death on the Nile\\" is a really good movie.<br /><br />You get so much here: exotic scenery; a great set where most of the story takes place (an early 20th century steamer); about a dozen famous actors giving top-notch performances (some understated, some slightly scenery-chewing, but all entertaining); solid direction by John Guillerman; a polished screenplay by Anthony Shaffer (Hitchcock's \\"Frenzy\\"); and, to top it all off, a wonderful, memorable score by Nino Rota (\\"The Godfather\\").<br /><br />And the film features the best kind of Agatha Christie murder plot and solution: one that is sufficiently complex, but understandable and believable (at least in the world of the movie) once the great Hercule Poirot explains it all to us.  It also helps that the solution is genuinely clever.<br /><br />Is \\"Death on the Nile\\" as great as \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\"?  In the end, probably not.  But the worst one can really say is that \\"Murder\\" is a lush, epic, beautiful film that just happens to be a murder mystery, while \\"Death\\" is clearly part of the murder mystery genre from the outset.  But there's nothing wrong with a really great murder mystery, and this film is one of them.<br /><br />The DVD features an excellent widescreen print that's sharp and bright, and a handful of interesting extras, including a 24-minute behind-the-scenes featurette produced at the time of the film's release (probably for the emerging cable market) and a couple of interviews conducted by a Spanish journalist, where we get to see Peter Ustinov answer questions quite well with his servicable Spanish (conveniently subtitled in English).<br /><br />By the way, I finally saw this movie not because I'm an Agatha Christie fan (though I am such a fan, as many of my Amazon reviews readily demonstrate), but because I'm doing a favor for my wife and watching with her all the movies available on DVD that feature the great Bette Davis, in their original release order.  It's been fun.  However, by the time the late 1970's rolled around, there weren't any true \\"Bette Davis movies\\" anymore, only movies that offered small or moderate character roles for the once top box office draw.  So, in addition to everything else that's good about the film, one gets to see Bette Davis in one of her last five or six roles here.  It's not a huge, memorable role (apparently Ms. Davis was disappointed that this movie wasn't able to do for her what \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" did for Ingrid Bergmann, namely earn her another late-career Academy Award), but seeing her is one more pleasure in a film rich with pleasures great and small.Agatha Christie fan (though I am such a fan, as many of my Amazon reviews readily demonstrate), but because I'm doing a favor for my wife and watching with her all the movies available on DVD that feature the great Bette Davis, in their original release order.

B00005OAA6|4.0|It would be hard to outdo Emma Buntons' epic \\"Free Me\\" album. That CD remains to me perhaps the best thing to come out of the entire Spice Girls franchise. I have had Victoria's album in some form or the other for the last four years or so, and have found that despite its' many minor flaws, it is as fresh and listenable as it was all those years ago. Remember that this is a rarity in Britpop, a genre that sound immediately dated once a record is about two months old.<br /><br />\\"Not Such an Innocent Girl\\" was the lead single here, and though it has a fine hook, it is certainly not the best track on the album. Simple choruses and hugely infectious beats are the mainstay of the album, and its fairly obvious that they wanted to mass-market this as much as they could. The album officially flopped in the UK, but I must say that this is certainly better than most of the albums put out by some of the other Spice Girls. For starters, this is better than Geri Halliwells' \\"Schizophonic\\", and light years ahead of Melanie B's \\"Hot\\".<br /><br />Personal favorite here is \\"A Mind of its Own\\". This is a song that deserved great chart success but is instead relegated to second rung - though I can't imagine why they didn't promote this entire album more aggressively. On tracks such as \\"No Trix\\" and \\"I Wish\\", its evident that this is an album topped up with potential singles - and the failure of this album will always remain a surprise to me.<br /><br />Victoria Beckham is not the greatest vocalist. But hey, neither are Madonna or Kylie Minogue. Victoria actually recorded TWO follow-up albums to this - one entitled \\"Come Together\\", and the other was \\"Open My Eyes\\", but due to some reason or another, both remain unreleased. Pity, because for all her supposed pretentiousness and celebrity allure, the truth is Mrs. Beckham is a solid solo pop star, and if this remains the only album she records, then I'm fine with that, because at least she put out one spectacular record.<br /><br />Its mighty hard for ANY British female pop star to make a record better than Emma Buntons' \\"Free Me\\", but with this album Victoria came pretty close. If you're a pop fan at all, this is essential listening. Try to get it off Amazon's UK Store, as the price there is far more reasonable.<br /><br />Four Stars.le pop star to make a record better than Emma Buntons' \\"Free Me\\", but with this album Victoria came pretty close.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|SICKO by Mike Moore isn't sick, it is a funny look at the American Medical System showing all the places where our medical service fails to serve us.  Mike Moore also compares our system with others showing where our system fails to serve our patients at a reasonable price.  This is an important movie that everybody should see.  Share this movie with your friends.
0316067598|5.0|My wife purchased this book for me and gave it to me at 4:00PM on a Saturday, I finished it the following morning - I simply could not put it down. Marcus is a true HERO, and his description of BUDS training was very in-depth. This book tells a wonderful story of heroism and dedication. Regardless of ones politics this book describes the true sacrifice the Seal Team memebers made for their Country and their fellow team members. After reading this book, my wife read it, and we have purchased copies for friends and family members who were equally moved by the horror these men faced and that Marcus overcame.

B00009UW0N|5.0|With movies like Hostel and Saw making the general public immune to extreme gore and violence, the original Halloween movie by John Carpenter gets by on mood, music, and great performances by Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis (she's hot in this movie).  As a child of the 70s, I think this movie resonates more with me.  I was 9 years old when this movie came out in 1978, but I didn't see it until I was 12 on HBO.

0143142356|5.0|Ken Follett outdid himself with \\"World Without End\\".  I thought \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" was the best book ever written until I heard the unabidged audio version of \\"World Without End\\".    The characters are well developed and the descriptions of their person and surroundings is in great but interesting detail.  Follett's knowledge of archectiture and building crafts and processes is superb.  There is much history around the main occurences of the 14th Century and as a history bluff it is nice to see someone who researched their historical facts before writing.    The plot is well developed and carries through from start to finish without contradiction (book is over 1000 pages long).  Other than the written word the most important contribution to the 36 CD volume being worth listening to is the ability of the reader.  This reader is clearly the best I've ever heard.  His pronounciation is crystal clear and his ability to cast multiple voices of both sexes is fascinating.  We listen to this audio version and remain at our destination in the car many times for several minutes to hear the wrapup of a particular suspenseful track.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|As other reviewers note, this is by far the best documentary ever made concerning what is arguably the most momentous series of events in the history of humanity.  What most struck me this time around, having seen this several times over the years, was the extraordinary gift of hearing the voices of so many people with direct and consequential experience of the war.  People such as Britons Brian Horrocks (the commander of Britain's XXX Corps) and Lord Mountbatten; the Germans General von Manteufel and Hitler's secretary Traudl Jungl; Americans General Lawton Collins and Captain James Stewart; an extraordinary group of Russians; and a great many others, all now long gone, saw and were a consequential part of the unimaginable.  Watch their eyes as they give witness, remember their testimony, and reflect.  An amazing work and moving beyond measure.

B000RZIGVS|2.0|I like the show, no problems there. I was so upset though because when my boyfriend opened the box all of the cases holding the dvds were broken and/or chipped. Thank God it was a gift for my boyfriend because I would have been very embarassed giving a bunch of dvds in broken cases to someone else. not only did my order take a week longer than it was supposed to (because it was lost in the mail) it was not handled with care. You would think that something that costs hundreds of dollars would be taken care of properly.

As many of the reviews indicated, I found the book to be drawn out and did not think there was a very good flow to it either.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is one of the premiere blues guitarists of our time.  His refinement of the genre is reflected in Blues Deluxe through sophisticated, extended soliloquies that enchant the listener and leave one craving more.  Blues Deluxe is a conversation stopper and Bonamassa's greatest achievement so far. It is destined to become a classic.  This CD should appeal to all levels of blues listeners.

B000NDI3SK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000NDI3SK The Ascent of Man (5 volume set)]]<br />The extraordinary Jacob Bronowski chose a difficult task-namely, to follow Lord Clark's Civilisation with a parallel survey of man's achievements in science, technology and the realm of ideas.  Most would have failed miserably, given the towering impact of Clark's groundbreaking work.  Bronowski, however, was not only up to the task, but he has produced something truly astonishing, almost a personal, seemingly off-the-cuff diary of man's technological rise over the millennia.  Many who remember this series when it first aired have waited long for this DVD.  Buy it now--for yourself and for someone else as well.  Bronowski, who died too soon, delivers his deeply considered ideas in such a way that he appears to be talking (and I mean talking, not reading from a teleprompter) to you alone.  You must return to this again and again, for a lifetime.

0891419195|5.0|Omigosh.  As a former Marine, even though I never saw combat, Mr. Sledge made me feel right at home.  I was amazed to see the similarities between WWII Marines and my Viet Nam-era peers.  It took me back to my time and I know he was telling it like it was.<br /><br />I've read so many books about various wars, including the Pacific Theater in WWII.  I've also read several histories of the Marine Corps.  This was the first book I've ever read that told it plainly from the grunt's point of view.  I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />With the typical book about the War, you see the campaigns, the strategies, the successes and failures; but they're all at the highest level.  All those books left me asking questions about the details of how things are accomplished.<br /><br />For example, one can talk all day about the strategy of island hopping, what the strategy of both combatants at Okinawa was, how many troops were involved, etc.  But I've always wondered about the many details of making the thing work.  How did the ammunition get into the rifleman's hands?  How did they get their food?  What about personal sanitation when bullets are flying over your head?  How and when were units rotated in and out?<br /><br />While the individual grunt doesn't see the intricacies of the entire chain of supply, he is involved in carrying the ammo to his unit.  He does care about eating.  And he must take care of himself.<br /><br />This book provided a point of view that really helped me to understand these and so many other things that heighten my understanding of what it must have been like to be a ground combat Marine in WWII (or any war, for that matter).<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone.

037571457X|5.0|Ever Wondered what it was like to grow up as a child in Iran?  In the book Persepolis, Marjane Satrapi wrote about the difficulties and anxiety she has growing up in Iran. I am going to talk about her being young in her childhood, reading books for her imagination, and her late teenage years. Marjane is confused about having to do things she would not like to do such as why she had to wear a veil.  She was also confused what is going on with the war in Iran and the Shah. Furthermore, life is hard everywhere especially when there is war.   In the beginning of the book, Marjane is ten years old and living in Iran. Marjane and other students had to wear veils as part of the laws in Iran at school. Marjane Stated, \\"We didn't really like to wear the veil, especially since we didn't understand why we had to\\" (3). Marjane and her classmates acted like normal children do when they did not understand what was going on and made fun of wearing the veil. When a person is a child like Marjane, it is hard to have to follow rules like she did while she was in school. Being a younger child, Marjane wanted to be a prophet she loved God very much and believed in him. Other classmates thought she was crazy. One of Marjane's teachers asked  \\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\\" Marjane Replied, \\"I'll be a prophet\\" (8). The children laughed at her. Furthermore, Marjane had difficulty understanding why she had to do things just like any child would have.   Marjane read a lot of books. She wrote, \\"to enlighten me they bought books\\" (12).  While she read books she began to understand more of what was going on in Iran. For Marjane Reading was like playing outside, since she could not very much at that time.  Reading books brings out Marjane's imagination; for example she wrote,  \\"Despite everything, god came to see me from time to time. So you don't want to be a prophet anymore\\", God asked. \\"Let's talk about something else.\\" Marjane Replied, God said \\"You think I look like Marx?\\" She replied, \\"I told you to talk about something else\\" (13). With her imagination, she thought she was really talking to God and he was replying back to her. Reading brought out Marjane's Imagination because, that was her escape from the world.  Marjane did a really good job on describing her childhood and with the illustrations a person can imagine everything that was happening. Furthermore, books were a life saver for Marjane, that was her only way to be like a normal child.     As Marjane got older, she was willing to fight for what she believed in. When another child's father killed lots of people she wanted to show that kid a lesson, she stated, \\"In the name of the dead, million, we'll teach Ramin a good lesson. I have an idea\\" \\"My idea was to put nails between our fingers like American brass knuckles and to attack Ramin\\" (45).  Marjane started to get more rebellious and even started up smoking.  She even got expelled from school.  As she was getting older the war was getting worse.  In conclusion, life was not easy as growing up in Iran but she persevered and kept going.    Persepolis was an amazing story of Marjane's life.  Marjane intended to show people that her childhood was not easy there was a lot of things going on with the War and the Shah.  She also conveyed, that she was not perfect but she got through it. A reader can imagine what is going on with the illustrations.  I believe she did a excellent job on illustrating exactly how she is feeling.  I recommend this book to any reader interested in growing up in Iran.      Works Cited : Satrapi, Marjane. Persepolis. United States: Pantheon Books, 2003.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|So many reviews of this film have already been written that pretty much cover the gamut about it that I would like to direct this one to those who, like me, grew up with the Spidey comic books and to this day still live and breathe vicariously through Peter Parker as we now watch his every step taken out from the comic and on to that giant screen.<br /><br />\\"It's me! Peter Parker! Your friendly neighborhood... You know. I've come a long way from becoming the boy who was bitten by a spider. Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me, and now...\\" and now we have 3: three films and three villains.<br /><br />The problem is that ALL three villains appear in this one movie - way too many to stay focused on the story or one story line. It would have been better to just concentrate on one villain while just making a slight reference to the others as a teaser for future sequels. Sort of the way I think Dr. Curt Connors (Parker's physics professor), was used in this film. Those familiar with the comic book series will know that Connors plays a major role in Peter/Spider-Man's life down the road. In fact, in the book series there is a story involving Dr. Connors and Morbius the vampire which would be a good reason to also bring in another Marvel franchise character to the mix - BLADE! Now that would be a great crossover/team up huh?<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />MAYBE A SPOILER OR TWO AHEAD!<br /><br />Like many other reviewers here, I too was upset at the numerous times we saw characters not wearing their mask! We get instead the actor's face with the costume on during all the action scenes. Whose idea was this? The studio or the actors for fear of not getting their mug on screen long enough? I want to see Venom, not Topher Grace! Blatant vanity I say!<br />I also cringed at the scenes where we see Peter strutting down the street ala John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever and also at the jazz club upstaging Mary Jane. Hokey and embarrassing!<br /><br />The movie is chock full of great action scenes: watching Spider-Man fight with each villain while at some time or another falling from the sky was a sight to behold! Not as great an aerial fight as Neo and Agent Smith had in \\"Matrix Revolutions\\", but still spectacular in its own right.<br />The special effects are as good as they come and some funny moments throughout were welcomed. One in particular has Parker talking with a spectator who turns out to be Spider-Man creator, Stan Lee (doing a cameo - again!), talking Marvel Comics speak.<br /><br />Then there is Gwen Stacy. What more can I say? Those who know who she really is (was), can only feel a certain sadness when she first appears on screen.<br /><br />I wanted to love this film - LOVE I tell you, but I couldn't. Yet I couldn't bring myself to hate it either.<br /><br />As I said, I grew up reading Spider-Man books and aside from all the great villains, stories and artwork, what I remember most is Peter Parker himself. His life, his loves, his relationships and how he was just a common kid like me. I cheered for him, laughed and cried along with him too.<br /><br />So when I look at this latest installment in the franchise (lame compared to the greatest super hero movie of ALL time: Spider-Man 2), I want to hate it, I want to blast it like so many here, but I can't because it's still Peter Parker up there on that giant screen. It's not the same Parker that Stan Lee, Steve Ditko, John Romita, Gerry Conway and Gil Kane gave us, but it's still him and to say I hate this movie would be like a betrayal to Parker, Spidey and my entire childhood.<br />Spider-Man/Peter Parker is a part of my life and he may be part of yours too and as bad as this film turned out to be, remember-<br /><br />IT'S STILL PETER PARKER UP THERE!ider-Man fight with each villain while at some time or another falling from the sky was a sight to behold!

B000OLGCI4|5.0|Disney's latest addition to its platinum DVD series is its 1967 classic, \\"The Jungle Book\\". Many reviewers have complained about the widescreen transfer of the film for this new DVD - I'm not. Having both the platinum release and the original limited issue '99 disc, the sound and picture quality of the new edition towers over its imperfections. A worthy addition to the platinum DVD collection.

B000ATQYT2|3.0|I'd love to know who the bonehead was at Disney who decided \\"When Love is Gone\\" was not worthy of the widescreen version?  Is this just a money-making ploy so we'll have to purchase a THIRD version when they decide to re-insert it?  Why can't they just leave it to the public's discretion to fast forward through the sections we may not want to see?  That Disney exec needs his *ss kicked.

B000ETQPYM|5.0|This was a wonderful book!  I initially bought it because the movie is coming out soon and I needed something to read on the plane.  However, once I started it, I could not put it down!  It was an amazing story of how a woman deals with the untimely death of her husband.  And the notes he writes to her are emotional and exciting!  Great read :)

B00006CXSS|4.0|The story of E Company 506 PIR of the 101st Airborne by Stephen Ambrose is considered a classic.  The video captures not only the spirit of the story of the unit from its creation and training through the end of the war, but has selected a group of actors who portray with great accuracy the individuals who made up the cadre, especially those, like Winter and Nixon who made it all the way through the war. Sobel is partiularly well cast as is Winter.  I highly recommend it.  The only caveat is that Ambrose chose to write about the 101st and not the 82nd, but you can't have everything!
B000Y1ZXU2|3.0|Again, since I am a huge tool fan, this was a must for me to pruchase, and again I am dissapointed.  Nothing groundbreaking with the video, more of the same computer generated stuff like their last 2 dvd singles, no live footage, and droning documentary of the making of the video is just boring after a bit.  I wish they would have at least re-mixed the track, or added one live track, something.      The packaging is excellent though, and almost makes up for the lack of content on the CD.  there are several 3-d cards and the viewfinger much like the 10000 days cd featured.  I got this at a cut rate sale price, so not to dissapointed, but again, for true fans only.  If you just like the music and not collecting, just stick with the CD's.

1567315682|4.0|Drs. Stanley and Danko have taken a somewhat empirical approach to answer the question \\"how do people become millionaires?\\" I have to say \\"somewhat\\" in that many of their observations, while empirical in nature, are not strictly valid statistically, since much of their material is obtained from focus groups and case studies, which are small sample groups.<br /><br />However, Drs. Stanley and Danko provide an invaluable primer on the nature of millionaires.  The most important of their observations is the need to live well below one's means.  John Lithgow, in the near-classic \\"Cliffhanger\\" said it best: \\"Do you know what real love is...? Sacrifice.\\" To become a millionaire, you have to give up a lot of other things.  Over and over, the authors harp on the need for upper-middle class people to avoid the upper-middle class trappings of big houses, expensive cars and tastes.<br /><br />I also appreciated the book for what it lacked.  Unlike practically every other get-rich book currently out there, the authors did not fetishize the building of net worth through purchase of highly leveraged real estate.  Yes, they do mention it, but mainly in the context of promoting stability and choice of middle class real estate as opposed to high-end real estate.  Their argument is that a larger home leads not only to larger mortgage payments, but higher taxes, higher fixed costs, and a greater likelihood to try to acquire symbols of status that your neighbors have.  As someone who is over-leveraged with his primary residence in terms of my overall net worth, and who has only partially resisted the tendency to try to keep up with the Joneses, I understand their reasoning and agree.  Besides, people who think that their homes are going to appreciate like they have in the past five years are deceiving themselves.<br /><br />The book also has the courage to say the truth that dares not speak its name: too much education is harmful to wealth accumulation.  Essentially, the authors make their point by noting that: (1) time spent in school is time lost to earning a living; (2) professionals often feel like they have to have the trappings of success to go along with their \\"M.D.,\\" \\"D.D.S.\\" and \\"Esq.\\" titles, which sucks them into a high-consumption lifestyle; and (3) a plurality of millionaires are entrepreneurs, who do not have the need for a lot of education.  To many people, this is akin to just saying yes to drugs, but looked at objectively, the authors make sense.<br /><br />However, the book does have some drawbacks.  First, I'd like to see an update of this book.  The economic analysis uses 1996 numbers.  (I read the 1998 edition and now I see that there's a 2003 edition so maybe they've updated the numbers.)  Moreover, some of the tax law forming the basis for their comments has changed, so the book is misleading.  For example, the authors state that an intergenerational transfer of $10,000 can be made tax-free (p 214).  The amount as of 2007 is actually $12,000.  See 26 U.S.C. §2503(b).<br /><br />Also, the book is highly repetitive in some of its examples and conclusions.  Perhaps the authors felt like they needed to bulk their book up to make it more saleable, but it was annoying to read example after example of under-accumulators of wealth.<br /><br />The book also only briefly discusses *why* people want to become millionaires.  Not everyone has high priorities for the future, and let's face it, driving the current year's Lexus SUV is a lot more fun than driving a 1984 Buick LeSaber.  The authors do mention (p 170), but do not emphasize, the thing that most commends thriftiness, hard work and sacrifice: the freedom that comes with self-sufficiency, or what Bob Brinker calls \\"critical mass.\\" A direct discussion on this point would have been helpful.t: (1) time spent in school is time lost to earning a living; (2) professionals often feel like they have to have the trappings of success to go along with their \\"M.D.,\\" \\"D.D.S.\\" and \\"Esq.\\" titles, which sucks them into a high-consumption lifestyle; and (3) a plurality of millionaires are entrepreneurs, who do not have the need for a lot of education.

0783116934|4.0|A disturbing look at a true case in which a serial killer was able escape detection for years because of the incompetent and often ideologically-blind givernment. Even when the local authorities agreed to investigate they refused to make the crimes public \\"because serial killers do not exist in the Soviet Union.\\"<br /><br />Even when the forensics expert placed in charge of the case finds the suspect with a knife and a rock in his bag, the weapons used in the murders, he is forced to release him because an incompetently conducted blood test wrongly exonerates him... and because he is a Communist Party member.<br /><br />An interesting study, a real-life Gorky Square.
1594489505|5.0|This is one of the must have books of the year, the descriptions, the way the author goes deep in people's feelings while keeping us updated with the political scene and surroundings in the Afghan culture. One of the best books I read this Year, well done sahib!!
B000FSME1A|5.0|Love the movie both of versions of them.  I just really would of sacrificed the \\"special features\\" to have them put at least one of the versions on the same disk.  You really start to get in to the movie and then the mood is destroyed by having to get up and change the disk knowing darn well they could have easily put it all on one disk.  Had I known I would have bought a use old copy that was on one disk.  But the movie is great!!
B000VLE3GA|4.0|Nothing new about this collection, and it doesn't have 10 Years Gone, but besides that it's got just about everything.
B00008DDXL|4.0|This second movie is better than the first.  The thing that really made me like this movie is that these kids are real. They grew up, got uglier, got prettier, got taller, got fatter, and everything else all of us slugs go through. The director didn't cut any squeakiness of the voice or put on lots of makeup to cover up the acne.  The story wasn't as detailed as the book story and they cuts lots of things out that I thought would be good in the movie but oh well!  If you liked the first movie, you'll definitely like this movie.
B000P0J02E|5.0|This is the best of all the Pirate soundtracks.  The new love theme is absolutely gorgeous.  I could listen to this one endlessly.
B000062TU1|4.0|I liked this movie. It wasn't nearly as good as the book but, then again, they never are.  I thought whoever directed this film did a very good job with picking the actors. Daniel Radcliff did well as Harry Potter. Rupert Grint was OK. He looked the part well enough but he's not the best. Emma Watson is a fantastic Hermione and played the part better then the picture in my head played it. Dumbledoor was the best Dumbledoor there could have been and the same with Snape.  The story was cut short, but it always has to be.  All in all, if you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll like this movie of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|I have watched this movie twice (HD-DVD) as well as in the theatre.  I keep seeing things I missed each time I watch it.  Very good, exciting movie and it's excellent in HD-DVD.  I highly recommend it.
B000NA28I4|4.0|I know that Eragon the book was wildly popular but I honestly thought that this was much better than the book. The book was boring and slow-paced, hard to follow and extremely detailed almost to the point of forgetting what the plot line was because of the amount of detail.  This movie, however, was straight and to the point with a great battle scene and good acting.   Even though this wasn't my favorite movie, I liked it a lot. Like I said, in my opinion, this book is much better than the book.
B0002TT0NW|3.0|This is a good movie but not what I thought it was going to be. The book was the worst book there was(not to say it was a bad book, but just that it wasn't the best by far) but the movie hardly even scratched the surface of the entire story.  I think what bothered me the most about the movie is that Dumbledoor changed. I know the first Dumbledoor died and the director couldn't do anything about that but there were a lot of better options for the roll of Dumbledoor than the one they picked.  The other thing was that they changed the entire castle. The first castle was much more magical and more exciting. This second castle looked like any castle you might see a picture of in a magazine. It just didn't capture the imagination like the first did.  This is a good movie, it just seemed like there were a lot of changes really suddenly that distracted from the story.
B000088E6D|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy Michael Buble's style - one you just don't see that often today, and especially not done well.  This album keeps with Buble's Jazzy style, I especially enjoy \\"Sway\\" as well as his rendition of \\"Come Fly With Me\\" - makes me think of Frank and the rest of the smooth voiced crooners of years past with a fun modern spin on it.<br />I look forward to more from Buble to add to our collection.
9707704667|5.0|As a peruvian, I truly appreciated the narrative and the words used, it brought me back to the time I lived in Lima.  I was actually hoping that the book would have continue until 1990.  Llosa described the political atmosphere in Peru during the decades, and given the fact that he ran for president in 1990 I think it would have been great to read about that, but I can understand why he did not.  One reviewer mentioned how come women do not feel offended about this novel.  Here is my response to that, lets face it, there are terrible man in the world and terrible women as well, lets stop pretending that when somebody describes a bad woman it should be offensive.  Besides, if I should feel offended would be on the lack of character of Ricardo, who lived his life in a mediocre way and his only goal was to be with the bad girl, I do not think that he was portrayed as a hero by any means.  Overall, the novel was very interesting, funny in some ways, the descriptions of the story transports you to those days even if you were not even alive then.  Great job by MVL

B000WCBMA8|4.0|While tearing the celophane off my new copy of The Black And White Album, I was expecting some - but not much - progression from the last record.  Taking a step back to 2004, I liked what I heard on Tyrano Hives: basically the same loud, fast, energy-packed vibe as the fantastically great Veni Vidi Vicious only with some new electronic accompaniment.  But overall, nothing exactly surprised me.  So as I listened to the B&W Album's opener, I was a little disappointed because I was hearing a song that could've easily been found on either of the previous two records.  However, after that the similarities became much less obvious.  Instead of another safe album in the same vein as the first two, the band definitely took some chances on this one - namely in the form of widespread keyboard additions, new tempos, and some different tweaks from Mr. Almqvist on vocals.  I'll leave it to the other reviewers to give you a track-by-track rundown, just know that the start/finish of this album will be very familiar to Hives fans but everything inbetween varies from new to strange to familiar in no particular order.  A nice step forward indeed.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|What can I say?  I'm a huge LOTR fan and have been purchasing the complete recordings for the past couple of years.  They are beautifully packaged, I recieved them quickly and they are just wonderful to listen to.  I now have about 8 hours of music to listen to.  I especially like them for the little songs that were sung by some of the characters in the movie.  If you're a hard core fan, then this is these are the CD's for you!
B000VDDDY6|3.0|Despite the recreated visual effects, it is important to emphasize that the word \\"remastered\\" very much applies in this case. A couple of new extras aside, most of the time a longtime viewer is treated simply to the virtually spotless image with brief CG interludes in the average episode, and even there the goal is to emulate the style of the original series as much as possible, with varying degrees of success. (I'm reviewing the DVD side here -- with the right equipment, the audio-visual experience is going to be much better on the HD side, of course.)     At the same time, there is no reason for casual viewers to start with the old DVD set, because the HD remastering very much improves the overall viewing experience even on the DVD side. Therefore, if you are a casual viewer who would like to see more of the original Star Trek, definitely start with the remastered shows. Still, I'm giving the set three stars because its complex packaging, steep price, and the choice to combine HD DVD and DVD content diminishes the purchasing experience for an otherwise great season of the original series.
6304806418|1.0|I never received this dvd so I cannot review it.  I did receive an AC/DC video that someone in Pennsylvania had ordered for a recipient in Newfoundland.  I notified Amazon and returned the missent dvd but I have received neither a refund nor any other information about this item that was ordered more than a month ago nor can I find anyone in customer service who seems interested in helping me beyond the \\"I am sorry. We are getting lots of calls like these.\\"    So it's interesting that Amazon now wants me to review a product that I was charged for and never received.  Oh - I did get a confirmation that the DVD I was sent was returned.  My refund was marked as $0.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Somehow, I missed Dexter when it aired in 2006. Wow, after one episode my husband and I were hooked and now our daughter is addicted as well.  Dexter is a vigilante serial killer...he only kills those who do terrible things.  The funny thing is Dexter is very likable during the day when he interacts with his coworkers (at The Miami Police Department!), sister and girlfriend.  The series is very creative, the writing is wonderful and the acting is superb.  If you like the Sopranos, you will love Dexter!

The group that sings \\"Coming into Los Angeles\\" is not present in the scene names, but is really present in the video.

B000VR824S|5.0|This was an amazing concert experience to be at and the DVD manages to capture all of the extraordinary performances.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|My order arrived very quickly  (much sooner than I expected) and in perfect condition.
B000XB5WHW|4.0|This version comes with Fingers and Centerfold, two songs that i heard on other versions of this cd but never found on the same disc. i swore that i would only purchase it when those two tracks were on the same disc. and lo and behold!!!! This came a long.  A great album from Pink. lots of sass and great catchy melodies. especially worth the purchase for the stellar bonus tracks.
B000SW4DLM|1.0|Rated only 1 star because you (Amazon) must make it crystal clear what the user is getting here, as there are now three versions - the original, the director's cut, and the most recent director's final cut!!!

0439882826|5.0|[[ASIN:0439882826 Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy]]<br />I bought two copies of this book as Christmas presents for my sons, ages 45 and 36. They were huge Star Wars fans in their younger years.  The younger son is on deployment in Saudi Arabia and has already received his Christmas gifts from us.  He raved about the book, read it in one sitting, and said it was a real trip down memory lane.  He can't wait to get home and read it again with his four children.  So a spur-of-the-moment purchase turned out to be a winner!  Now, what will the 45 year old think?
0316067598|5.0|Reccomended by a friend best book I've read in a long time. The detail of Seal training was mind-boggling and then what the training helped Marcus Lattrell accomplish \\"unreal\\". I wish a movie would be made of this story. The dedication to our country and commander-in-chief is remarkable. These committed individuals are what make this country so great. A must read.
0198711905|5.0|This is a must have for any student of literature or lover of Shakespeare. However, this is not meant to be light reading. If you are a student, particularly undergrad, you will be better served by cliffs notes or spark notes.

B000UR9TQO|4.0|I purchased this at a different location than from Amazon and found it to be in better condition than the first review provided.  His claim that the case is cheap is not entirely true.  The T-shirt did need to be placed with it, but the rest of it has containers for both the DVD/CD and for all the bonus material.  You can seperate them and keep them together if done properly.  Just Bill must have torn the whole thing apart if he had to put the DVD/CD in a sleeve to protect them.  It has cases for everything which is inside a box (container)  Worth the purchase if you want to see the extra footage/music that is inside of it.
0141187476|5.0|If you love the BBC TV mini-series based on Evelyn Waugh's \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", it's not an option not to own this book!  While the script and dialogue almost follow line by line from the novel, it is an immense pleasure to read the actual novel and savour Waugh's witty and delightful writing style.  His education at Lancing and Hertford College at Oxford, comes through vividly in the book about the friendship between Charles Ryder and Lord Sebastian Flyte who met at the Oxford University and their choices and journeys in life.  This edition with Evelyn Waugh's photo on the front cover is my favourite.
1596680296|5.0|I tried knitting socks with another book and did not succeed.  I thought I would try this one and it was a great success.   It takes you through each step in making socks and explains the difficult parts - gusset, heel turn - very well.  The illustrations are amazing.  Highly recommended for making socks.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|Party Monster is one of my all time favorite movies...It's about the life and times of a group of party \\"club-kids\\" in the late 1980's.  It's fun, fabulous, and yes, cheesey and campy! The story has some great twists and turns in it!  Watching it you may think it's somewhat of an over exagerated story, but the clincher is, it's based on a true story!  How Fabulous is that?   All the actors did a wonderful job in taking you back to those club daze (days).. but, Macaulay Culkin, Seth Green and Marilyn Manson, those three kept me glued to the screen.. some really great acting there!

I fell in love with the characters.  I fell in love with the story.  I am now reading further into the Ender Series as well as the Shadow series and I cannot get enough. You should take the time and give these books a try.  Let yourself fall into their world for awhile.  You will not be disappointed.  I am now a sci-fi fan...at least as far as fans of Ender and Orson Scott Card are concerned.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This spook of Star Trek is one wild and funny ride. This film is very funny in its own way ,but if your a fan of Star Trek then you won't be able to resist the jabs taken at the fans of the 40 year old franchise. Fun for every member of the family. The casting is great, the special effects would make Gene Roddenberry look like an Orion with envy.
0399242864|5.0|My 3 year old son absolutely loves this book.  He relates so much to what the boy goes through.  Having a rocketship that doesn't work too well.  Trying to find a seagull that will help fly him up.  Finding a tall tree to climb up.  He has the entire story memorized and when we read it, we really do read it together.    The illustrations are very well done.  The shadows move under the trees as the time changes from dawn to morning to lunch to afternoon to evening.  The story is simple, but you can talk to your child about what they would do the same or differently on each page in trying to catch a star.    Each page can be viewed from an adult perspective or a child's perspective.  Does the boy just find a starfish?  Or did the boy find the shooting star from three pages back?
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The voices and visuals are perfectly matched. This is a DVD that can be watched and enjoyed over and over and over. A delight.
0895260131|5.0|I read this book to get a better idea of what kind of culture/religion (basically interchangeable in Islam) my wife comes from. She and I have been married for almost 2 years now, and it has definitely been a huge struggle at certain times when dealing with family issues. Her family immigrated here more than 2 decades ago from Afghanistan. My wife became a Christian shortly after we met, and was previously one of the most devout of her nine other sisters. Her family thinks she converted for me, but she had been having extremely strong doubts of Islam, and came to her own conclusions. She was kicked out of the house and ostracized from most of her family. As for us, we have been incredibly fortunate to have a church family that has become the family that we need and has been a huge support and encouragement.<br />  One of the things I appreciate about Robert Spencer is that he lays out his argument in a clear, point-by-point analysis, and he uses mostly Islamic sources to make his points (even more-so in his other book I'm reading: The Truth About Muhammad). If you have seen him on TV or on an interview, you will notice also in his writing he leaves out the emotion that can so easily grab hold of anyone addressing the atrocities of such a religion as Islam. He writes in a very level-headed fashion and does not intend to bash anyone. If a person gets offended by what he writes, it's because (1) they're muslim, (2) they believe that Muhammad and the Koran (and Hadith for that matter) are above reproach and criticism, which is ridiculous, (3) and they haven't ever doubted what they believe, because doubt is a sin in itself in Islam.<br />  Spencer makes a great comparison between Jesus and Muhammad in each chapter, showing just how polarized each figure is in what they taught. Muslims believe Muhammad is the supreme example of how to live, and there are MANY verses saying that, or saying that if they obey Muhammad, they are obeying Allah. As Christians, we believe Jesusis God. The difference however is that Muhammad wrote his own religious book, and made himself the \\"goodest\\" of all people. So if you follow his example, you will be the most \\"good\\" person you can be, which is what Islam is all about: your \\"goodness\\" outweighing your \\"badness.\\" The most amazing thing about muslims is that they also believe Jesus lived a perfect life, and even believe He was born of a virgin! So why they would regard Muhammad as more powerful and a better example to follow is beyond me.<br />  All-in-all, Americans are fed up with the Politically Correct garbage going around the US about Islam being a \\"Peaceful Religion\\", which is exactly opposite of the truth. There have been over 9,000 separate incidents of Islamic terrorist acts since 9/11/01. Like my in-laws, muslims learn everything about how to argue how Jews and Christians have everything wrong, how the Bible is chock full of translational errors because it has been translated so many times, etc. But they neglect to learn about who Muhammad really was, what kind of life he lived, why he had so many wives, why he married a 6 year old and had sex with her 2 years later, why he personally had hundreds of people slaughtered and murdered them himself at times, and why they try to hide it when you bring that stuff up!!?? It's not a secret Muhammad was a terrible person: muslims are either living in utter denial of everything they believe, or they haven't learned of it themselves. My in-laws are the Americanized, \\"peaceful\\" muslims, and my wife and I had one final \\"discussion\\" on religion during the last week of Ramadan (supposedly the time where muslims make peace with family and do other pious deeds) and two of the sisters told us they would kill us both right now if a holy war were waged... now tell me: peaceful or not?
B000WC3864|2.0|About two years ago here in Chicago at the Flashback horror con they had a Evil dead reunion.Most of the activities were filmed for another dvd release of the film that has just now come out.For some time ive enjoyed the joke of how many versions of the Evil Dead films Anchor Bay has put out .So i was originally going to hold out and buy this one used like many of the other versions.On my bookshelf i have all but two of the many versions of the three films sitting side by side.But i heard the panels from that convention would be on there and that was exciting for me.See my friend is a big Evil Dead fan like so many people out there are,and as we sat in on the reunion panel he really wanted to ask a question to Bruce .I suggested asking why there are so many editions of the film.When he got the chance to ask the question Bruce had Tom the president of Anchor bay come out and give his opinion.Being that this was two years ago all i remember was Tom being a bit put off as if he had never heard this gripe and went off on my friend as if he was being a jerk for asking the question.He claimed that it wouldnt be fair to hold off on versions of the dvd every time something new was made or found ,that he was doing a service to the fans putting a new edition out every year.       Back to the new dvd,once i saw that this panel would be on the dvd i was excited that my friend would be on there asking a question i know so many people wonder.I watched the whole panel on the dvd and of course the only question that was taken out was my friends.I think it would have been far cooler if Anchor Bay had left my friends question on there instead of censoring it.      The best thing i can say about this edition is the packaging is beyond nice looking.The three discs are housed with most of the art that has been used for all the earlier dvd releases.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|I heard the song \\"I Wish I Could Go Traveling Again\\" while driving on the Freeway in San Jose, CA and suddenly I was taken to a different place.  I was just grateful there was a decent jazz station in the area.  While that song convinced me to buy the album (which I did on Amazon that evening), I heard another song (\\"Landslide\\") from the same album back in NY on WBGO.  When the DJ said it was Stacey Kent from her new album \\"Breakfast on the Morning Tram\\",  I KNEW I had picked a winner.  A few days later when I received the CD,  the song mix confirmed my expectations - a GREAT mix of songs by a vocalist who doesn't blast the notes, but still gives me the shivers.  Stacey - way to go !

0553573403|5.0|After many a hesitation to continue reading this boring book, I finally found the free time to truly submerge myself into it.  I found that it jumped from being boring, to an exciting masterpiece of deceit, lies, and underhanded cruelty.<br /><br />In the first half of the book, the most exciting parts were the hints about the past of Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon.  The rise of Robert to power seemed a far more intriguing story than the tedious workings of a kingdom working its way slowly to the point of self destruction.  Once things began to move however, the story becomes quite complex, exciting, and very interesting.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the painfully slow beginning to the book.  It becomes a thrilling work of storytelling worth reading, possibly more than once.
B000WGZGNS|4.0|I LOVE Beyonce.<br />I'm pretty much a Stan. And I saw this show in Las Vegas and had loads of fun (even though i was by myself).<br />However... i cant pretend that this is the perfect show just because i love her to death.<br /><br />Even during and after I saw the show Live i had some complaints.<br /><br />But I'll start the review with the positive.<br />Beyonce is a MONSTER ON STAGE!!!! We all know this, and it has been exhibited on various Dvd's and live performances in the past. One of the very few current entertainers that Dance AND Sing Live at the same time. And mann there are certain parts on this dvd where it's like... Crazy how she is able to do so. Especially in the first three songs, BACK TO BACK UP BEAT, Nothing but Energy and nothing but a full powerful voice.<br /><br />She sings loads of her hits here, practically all of them.<br /><br />Here in lies my problem.<br />Beyonce doesn't seem to know if she wants to be an over the top DIVA type performer or a down home-ish Soul/Funk performer. She goes in and out of both extremes at Too Many points of this show which makes it a little uneven.<br />I mean she has the all female band, and at very odd and arbitrary points in the show... she'll switch from having this elaborate stage setup with the DIVA clothing and posing to bringing more focus to the band and trying to Funk Out like James Brown or Tina Turner (or herself in the \\"Work it Out\\" video) with the band.<br />This just ruins the flow of the show to me, because these parts come at points where it really doesnt make sense or fit with what has been going on.<br />Another beef i had with this show was the fact that she shortened so many songs. I mean \\"Ring the Alarm\\" is barely even there anymore. Understandable that she would need to shorten certain parts, but especially in \\"RIng the Alarm\\" its just annoying and seemingly a waste of time.<br /><br />The best parts<br />The Destiny's Child Medley, it goes on for a while, but its really fun and she actually comes with some cool setups and moves for this set.

0634022296|5.0|I'm a musician and I love to figure out songs from the recordings.  However, this book showed how I had missed a few key chords and voicings in my Beatles transcriptions.  It is very accurate and the medium to advanced player will be able to pick it up immediately.  It will be a challenge for the beginner, but it is the REAL arrangements actually played by the Beatels, not some dumbed-down version with everything in C.  Higly recommended!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I saw the movie and had to get the soundtrack.  I wouldn't consider myself a die hard Beatles fan but I do enjoy their music.  I thought the various arrangements of the songs were refreshing and helped to tell the story of the movie.  I also thought all the performers voices were excellent.  The only disappointment was the omission of the song \\"So Heavy\\".  Not sure why it was left off.  Dispite that I stongly recommend this CD.
140120306X|4.0|While it's not the kind of comic you'd crack open for some light reading (though I guess if you wanted to you could skip the \\"Dossier\\" parts and just read the comic story) this is a very dense and jam-packed book that makes great use of the \\"multimedia\\" aspect of comics Moore played with in other books, especially \\"Watchmen\\". It loses a star because it is so narratively slight--it's there more to give info on the background of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen--but when viewed as part of the continuing story of LoEG it's an essential chapter.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I couldn't believe my luck to find this movie at this price!!  It was so much more everywhere else (about 15.00 more!)  It was delivered in 3 days and in perfect condition.  You're great Amazon, thanks a million!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is excellent.  It's extremly well done.  Reminds me of Saving PRivate Ryan.  So many war movies are shallow and phoney.  This one is very realisitc.  It's very important to know about history and of the men and women who gave their lives for freedom in WW II.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|Despite the tragic overtones of this  formation of the band, the music is incredible. a band of individuals in top form,  Duane Allman's virtuosity sometimes over shadows the fact of all the musicians playing with commitment and inspiration.  great songs and high level arrangements  the bonus set is a must for understanding  this short, sweet, incarnation of the Allman Brothers Band

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|The two lead actors are fantastic. Fans of [[ASIN:B00018D3XW The Commitments (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] should recognize the guy as he's played by Glen Hansard who played Outspan Foster, the guitar player in Alan Parker's motion picture. He has a great, emotional voice that comes through on the songs that he sings and is reminiscent of Richard Thompson. It gives the music a powerful punch and depth. He plays a character still haunted by a past relationship and this bleeds into his songs. Marketa Irglova brings a quiet, understated charm to her role. It's a wonderfully unaffected performance and the two of them have terrific chemistry together.<br /><br />These two musicians compliment each other well, encouraging each other's musical ideas. Think of this film as The Commitments: Unplugged. Once is one of those rare films where the actors are actually playing their instruments and singing instead of aping along to someone else's music. Hansard and Irglova are the real deal and this only adds to the enjoyment of the film. Once is personal, heartfelt filmmaking at its finest and a world away from the big budget bombast of a film like Dreamgirls.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Carney tends to dominate this track as he talks about the origins of the film's title. Irglova talks about the challenge of finding her character early on in the shoot. Hansard talks about his days with Carney in the band, The Frames and how he knew that Carney would go on to become a filmmaker.<br /><br />All three also provide a commentary for all of the songs in the film. Hansard says that they did the busking scenes early on a Sunday morning to avoid being recognized. They talk over each musical number, sometimes telling the origin of a song.<br /><br />\\"Making a Modern Day Musical.\\" Carney says that audiences have connected with the film because of its personal, intimate approach. Originally, Hansard wasn't going to be in the film but Carney liked the rehearsal footage of him with Irglova.<br /><br />\\"More Guy, More Girl\\" features Carney talking about the initial idea he had for the film. Cast and crew talk about making it with plenty of on-the-set footage which gives some insight into the creative process. Everyone speaks fondly of the filmmaking experience.<br /><br />\\"Webisodes\\" features one of the songs from the film done to really low-tech, stickman drawing animation.film but Carney liked the rehearsal footage of him with Irglova.    \\"More Guy, More Girl\\" features Carney talking about the initial idea he had for the film.

B000AP04L0|4.0|This low-budget sleeper from the mind of Mike Judge is a quirky, funny film that cuts to the quick of corporate America.  It skewers the hierarchy of the typical soul-stealing, cookie-cutter/cubby-hole workplace.  You'll never look at a stapler in quite the same way again.

Wisdom is so easily obtained.<br />The book's attraction is it's breezy, humorous prose.<br />I assume what also makes it attractive is the author's affirmation that epiphanies are relatively painless,  easy to come by,  and can be \\"all about me\\".  That would make the book right at home in many of today's yoga studios, meditations centers, mega-churches, and the like.

160024131X|5.0|My husband and I listened to Lone Survivor on our trip and were entirely gripped to those Navy Seals and their far and above extreme ordeal in the Afganistan mountains. Their story brought tears to our eyes.  We are so glad we heard this story of true heroism.  To think that they let the sheep herders go on their way, while knowing that it meant their certain death from the Taliban. To learn about the culture of the tribesmen in that area and the remarkable rescue was so interesting.  We highly recommend this book.
B00065MDSQ|4.0|Let's say it first, I am not a fan of King Crimson, but this album hit right on target, this is the kind of King Crimson that I like.  The title track is powerful and the last one, Starless, is very strong and melodic.  This cd is, in my humble opinion, the best of King Crimson from the seventies.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|The issues involved in \\"After the Wedding\\" are so over the top as to be almost unbelievable. Still, director Susanne Bier has kept the events from being sappy melodrama.Without blabbing away too much of the plot, Jacob (Mads Mikkelson) runs an orphanage in India, in sad financial state, and is given an offer he can't refuse. He goes back to Denmark to meet his benefactor (Rolf Lassgard), and here's where loads of angst and deception develop. Turns out Jacob and the benefactor's wife have history (young, baby-booming hippie lovers, at one time). When invited to their daughter's wedding, realizations happen and all hell breaks loose. Stine Fischer Christensen (as Anna, the daughter) is remarkable, and her mother, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) is even better, letter-perfect. The benefactor, Jorgen,  seems to have the upper hand, but as everything unfolds, true and honest characterizations develop. Can't say much more without giving away essential plot points, but I was riveted and highly entertained. The DVD extras are insightful, especially interviews with the director. The film is beautfully shot, and all the acting is excellent. I also enjoyed Christian Tafdrup, as the groom of the title-wedding. Nothing is ever as it seems, and revelations among the characters keep \\"After the Wedding\\" always interesting. The surprise Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Too bad it wasn't promoted better in it's American release. Very fine!
B000VBJEEG|2.0|Ratatouille is the Pixar movie which I thought would bring back the magic of Pixar which the studio seems to have lost after Cars, which I consider their worst film yet. Ratatouille has its moments of humor, emotion and beautiful visuals, but the film still lacks. The characters just arent engrossing enough. Perhaps the fact that Pixar tries to mix two different worlds of characters causes this confusion. Not only is the film giving us a glimse of the world of hungry rodents, but we also get a look at the human world. This leaves the characters litte time to develop and leaves things hanging out there with no real closure. Overall a poor attempt by Pixar, yet it's something which is worth watching once, but worth buying? I dont think so.
0061122416|4.0|I would agree with other reviews that the Alchemist is more parable than novel. This is the story of a shepard boy, Santiago's search for his Personal Legend as an allegory for the rest of us to break free from our daily routines and begin searching for our treasures. Paulo Coelho uses a common literary device to end this story (I won't spoil it for you). This is a fun vacation book but bring other books with you. This one is a fast read.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is without a doubt a classic in the history of Rock. Every songs is a hit and this album has aged very well.  There is no other band like the Beatles, they are just like good wine, it gets better with age.

0143038419|3.0|A friend recommended this book to me. There was much I liked about it - the author's quest for self-discovery and spiritual growth seemed sincere. There were some parts I found inspiring (I've always wanted to learn fluency in another language, and immersion is probably the best way, but it probably wasn't easy). I liked some of her thought processes as she worked through things, for example learning to like a certain meditation technique that she initially found oppressive and boring.<br /><br />On the other hand, many of her observations seem shallow and/or naive (she shares some of her not-so-keen insights about human nature and the world that I thought were pretty basic). For example: when you're a female who is traveling alone to a foreign country that is known for its high crime rate and you haven't bothered to do any research (maps, transportation, lodging)... that could cause some uneasy moments. D'oh. And she's shocked to learn that a poor Indonesian woman whom she is trying to help financially, turns out to be \\"working\\" her somewhat. Wow, you mean people lie, manipulate, and are sometimes greedy?  What a revelation!<br /><br />And c'mon, a lot of women have been through bad divorces.  She seems quite sure that her feelings of loneliness, depression, devastation, and failure were much more intense and significant that yours or mine. On the positive side, she doesn't dwell too much on the details of it (probably to avoid a libel lawsuit from her ex) and she does admit to her part in the failure of the marriage, which is at least honest.<br /><br />Most annoying to me was her liberal slant on things. She doesn't hammer it too badly, but clearly, President Bush and the United States are to blame for most of the problems in the world. And war is BAD. No matter that our soldiers are fighting to protect her freedom to spew liberal propaganda, war (any war, for any reason, apparently) is still bad and morally wrong. She's careful to make it clear to her new foreign friends how much she is \\"embarrassed\\" by the US. I wonder how long this tender blossom would last under a terrorist regime. About 8.2 nanoseconds is my guess.<br /><br />However, it's an easy and mostly enjoyable read... easy in the sense that her writing style is engaging and it flows very nicely. I didn't have trouble finishing the book, whereas sometimes I do if a book really bores me. Overall, worth reading.
B00080Z53O|5.0|this is a fantastic movie, you don't even notice you are reading subtitles.  i recomend it to anyone, even those who think they don't like foreign films.  :)

B00005JPLW|5.0|...for my Son, who is an Airborne Ranger stationed in Afghanistan for 2-years. The movie is full of gore and violence. That's what so cool about it. The special edition has a ton of extra content, as well. I must say, though, after watching this movie I feel a tad inadequate. Every character in the movie is ripped to the max, with body fat of less than 3%-4% :)    He and his \\"battle buddies\\" have been enjoying this movie while they are not \\"in country\\".    Happy Holidays,  Smacka
0634022296|3.0|Do not buy this book unless you just want to read the lyrics.  This has all the songs, mostly in order, and mostly more or less what you hear on the records, so that's good. However, the book itself is too small, does not open flat or want to stay on a music stand. No problem if you don't mind breaking the binding. It needs a spiral binder to really make it useful.  Not a bad book, just not as good as it could have been. Are the publishers paying attention to this?
B000VECAEO|4.0|Seinfeld has a different kind of humor but I have always enjoyed the situations these characters got into, sometimes pretty hilarious.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to break the monotony.
B00006I53S|5.0|This lens is great for the quality to price ratio, I have used this for about a week now and have had outstanding results, especially in the early morning hours when shooting photo's of deer or seals coming up on the beach, I would recommend it if you shooting in low light conditions, such as indoor party's and with the image stabilizer it makes pictures that are just that much better, I reviewed many lenses before making this purchase and if your looking for and all around medium weight lens for general use I would highly recommend this one.
0316067598|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this book...I read it out loud to my wife and she loved it, so it's not just for guys. Inspiring...sad...poignant, and heart pounding action. And 100% true story. A must read.

B000VR824S|5.0|If you are into guitars, guitar players and guitar music this DVD is even better than the 2004 release. The filming is up close and you really get a feel of the emotion of the players.  Bill Murray as MC is an added bonus. Highly recommended DVD.
1881273156|5.0|If you would like to learn how to improve the quality of your relationship, this book is a great place to start.    The author theorizes that we all have \\"love tanks\\" that need filling by our mates. It also shows us to to fill the \\"love tank\\" of your mate. Why is this important? People usually really knock themselves out trying to make their mate happy and feel unappreciated because the other person is not getting what they actually makes them feel loved.    For example, if your love language is quality time, and your mate is buying you gifts to make you feel loved, he/she may be missing the point. Your love language is the vehicle that make you feel loved. So, a better expression for you might be being taken out to a picnic alone having time to concentrate on one another.    This book will help you understand your mate better and yourself better, too.
B000WMEAKC|4.0|One Republic's debut album is really something else.  From the first note of the first song to the final chords of \\"Come Home,\\"  this album is a true demonstration of how to be expressive.  The hidden track of Timbaland's remix version of \\"Apologize\\" is also a nice surprise (sorry, didn't mean to ruin it).  These guys have a refreshingly unique style, mixing rock with soul, acoustic with beats, and everywhere in between. The classic cello adds so much depth to their sound as well.  LOVE IT!
B00005JN0T|5.0|Will smith is natural for sci-fi flicks, see any of his films.  thought provoking and mystical insight into robotic psychology, building to one of the most thrilling endings I've ever seen in movies.  This one is one ofthose movies you'll want to watch over and over again.  A must have for sci-fi fans.  THe special effects are entirely convincing.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|As an avid fan of both the film Blade Runner and the book by Philip K Dick, I was very excited about this \\"final cut\\" as the original director's cut DVD was totally lacking in all areas.  The Final Cut has definitely cleaned up the picture and the 5.1 is truly magnificent... Scott says that Vangelis' Blade Runner score has to be his best score and to hear in in 5.1, you want to agree with him.  The ads for this release make it sound like there are loads of changes and additional footage and this and that, but if you're looking for a bunch of added stuff, you're going to be disappointed.  There are a lot of things that have been done to the film to clean it up in the way of digital edits and there is additional footage, but according to Scott in the commentary, this version of the film is the shortest version in existence.  The clean picture and the sound is well enough reason to get this version for your collection.  But you're also getting full commentaries from Scott and two additional commentaries from the screen writers and others that helped in making this film, not to mention the second disk with the documentary Dangerous Days that goes into the making of the film.  This entire documentary is over three hours and thirty minutes and includes a number of deleted scenes, random shots, extended scenes, pictures of the pre-production... they talk about the fifth replicant \\"mary\\" and a cut story line involving Tyrell being an android himself.  There are filmed auditions and interviews from cast and crew... it is truly a definitive account of the making of the film and I can't say I've ever seen such a documentary for a film.      so to conclude, the blade runner film: well polished and fantastic. the dangerous days documentary: definitive and delicious.
B000ZN8036|2.0|The idea of this movie was a good one. Tell a story about a guy trying to find himself in the Alaskan wilderness. I had high hopes for this film.     However, in watching this film you get the feeling that you are not being told the whole story. Something just doesn't work. The character's activities and reactions are incongruent. He is seeking love, true acceptance, and happiness. However, he does not stay in touch with his sister with whom he was very close and he does not maintain his new relationships. He then enters the Alaskan wild completely unequiped and unknowledgable about survival. Then he just dies and that's it.    This movie would have been a triumph had he actually come to terms with his problems and his trip into the wilderness had been cathartic to him. Instead, you sense him slipping deeper into what was probably insanity and not reconciliing any of his issues.     This movie will appeal to people wanting to return to the 1960's hippie era, and they will say that there is some cosmic meaning in it. It is a Sean Penn film, and he sure has the knack of taking inconsequential things and trying to make them something they are not.    Additionally, the guy is very annoying. He meets new people (who are as emotionally needy as himself) and makes broad statements meant to sound prophetic or insightful in order to illicit emotional responses. He seemed to be a know-it-all with little life experience.    As this is a true story, I feel very sorry for the man lost in the wilderness and the family left behind. It is also sad that someone did not step in and get him the psychologial help that one can infer he needed.     I gave this two stars because the scenery is gorgeous and the actors really did the best with the story they had. Take a pass on this one.
B00005JPS9|2.0|To say that Niel Gaiman and Roger Avary have taken a few liberties with the classic tale of Beowulf is, regrettably, an understatement of truly epic proportions. Sadly, with so much obvious writing talent at hand, and with such an absolute bedrock of folklore, mythology, and high adventure, I find it absolutely unbelievable that what makes it to the screen in the final cut of this version of the story is the best that these two are capable of...     ...unless the goal is not to tell the tale, but rather to re-tell it with the intent of deconstructing and demythologizing it to the point of savage butchery. Much like the ill-fated post-modern big-screen version of \\"Troy\\", this version of the classic hero tale utterly fails in both heroism and scope when it vainly attempts to strip the narrative of anything transcendent, choosing instead to root all of its vainglory in the strength of man alone.     Ripping the spiritual guts from the story is a twofold problem. First, the authors join a long and unprestigious line of scribes who have attempted to recreate the tale based solely upon the pagan underpinnings of the dominant cultures, while either ignoring altogether or giving short-shrift via verbal backhands and/or displaying dubious adherents to Christianity. Whatever one's feelings toward that, it is nevertheless an important part of the original text. While lovers of such drivel as John Gardner's \\"Grendel\\" will rejoice, a great many others will simply shake their heads and return to the text, which is no bad thing.   Second, just as the spirituality is void in the film, so it goes with the personality of the characters as well. Characters that need to come across as utterly heroic, majestic, or tragic, simply don't emote as they ought; they often appear flat, stale, and searching for the story's next line like some unprepared understudy thrust onto the stage at the last minute. Whether this is due to the impressive (yet ultimately unfulfilling) 3-D animation, or theaforementioned character assasination of the text is beyond my ken; perhaps it is the unfortunate side effect of both .   I will rate the two stars based solely upon the action sequences; when they aren't mirroring the cinematics of an impressive PC game, they ARE a wonder to behold.   Beowulf is and remains a great tale; I wish the screenwriters had taken the time and tender loving care to more faithfully render it for the big screen.
B000M9BPEY|4.0|Great movie for anyone who loves a good fantasy/Tim Burton film, looked AMAZING compared to the dvd version that I also own, I'm only giving the blu-ray 4 stars due to lack of special features
B000HWXS2S|5.0|Amon Amarth is an awesome viking band. the lead vocalist reminds me of Henri Sattler of God Dethroned. both Amon Amarth and God Dethroned are death metal bands, but the difference is Amon Amarth's songs are about Vikings. if you like heavy metal, this fits in your collection. another Viking band that compares to Amon Amarth is the late Mithotyn. Amon Amarth has a great future ahead of it.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Occassionally a movie is made that makes you forget where you are for a couple of hours. This is one of them. It is impossible to watch this film and not be completely transported into her time.    Cate Blanchette was the perfect Elizabeth. She is regal and fierce in her role. She also shows the human side of Elizabeth and faces some of the same worries and circumstances that women in our age do such as wondering who she will marry and what is ethical. She had to make hard decisions that impacted all of England.    This movie gives you an historical perspective on the religious struggle in medieval Europe. Elizabeth leads her troops into war against King Phillip and beats him soundly, expertly avoiding an expanded Inquisition that was brutal and intolerant.    Of course there are many intense battle scenes as well as execution and torture. I had to cover my eyes. The cinematography was breath-taking and the costumes seem very authentic.    Elizabeth was made very human in this movie and is vivid unlike many written accounts of her life. This is a must-watch for anyone.
B000VSBX34|2.0|As a person who's about the same age as the Beatles, I was an enthusiastic fan at that time.  I still like to listen to their music occasionally.  This movie was a trip when it was released.  That's because everyone in the world was hungry for anything the Beatles put out.  Forty years later, it's just plain dumb.  I tried sitting through this thing with my 11, 12, & 14 year old grandkids, but even they couldn't stomach it.
0061122416|5.0|great story, advice, theme.  I wish I had read it in my early 20's when trying to decide on what to do.  I recommend this book for everyone! loved it!
B0007Q6PBK|4.0|La Boheme, a DVD of one of a series of Metroplitan Opera broadcasts, is opera at it's best...in my opinion. But I have always enjoyed opera not as a high-society, intellectual exercise featuring international stars dressed in formal attire, but rather as Corny Melodrama at its best. And this particular production is surely one of the finest examples of what kept the Italian commoners who crowded the theaters in ages past on the edges of their seats. I encourage anyone who is not an opera fan to try this one out, being sure to have a little Chianti in every act, relax and laugh and weep with the rest of us.     Then try Madame Butterfly, Carmen and the rest of the classics. You will love it.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|I've seen some of this series in the states, now that I'm in Iraq we're able to see the complete season, thank you again for the shipment.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just discovered this wonderful TV series that was cancelled by FOX network (they should have their heads examined) four years ago. I recognized it from the very entertaining movie \\"Serenity\\" made a couple years later. Living in rural Alaska I haven't had TV reception for 30 years, but I do watch VHS & DVD movies.       Firefly (and the movie) have great and well delineated characters, dialogue, plots, and surprises: funny and sad, exciting and intriguing, romantic and kick-butt. It would be great if there was a resumption of the series or maybe even more likely, a series of sequels to the movie. Though not a Trekkie, I do enjoy science fiction and this series is by far the most intelligent and enjoyable one I have ever seen in this genre.
B0000047EC|4.0|This was nice, but I think I was expecting a bit more, still very nice.
B000O179A4|5.0|\\"DREAMGIRLS\\" was a great movie. I thoughly enjoyed every moment of it. The acting was excellent even for first timer jennifer Hudson.I wasnt a fan of hers on American Idol but I sure was in this movie.The music just blew me away,it was so good.
B00000IQW3|4.0|Despite the \\"now\\" laughable special effects of the space station and starship battles in part of the movie, it still holds your attention.    The premise of video games as training and recruiting tools for pilots is ingenious and makes you wonder a little about the the possibilities for internet gaming.    The parallel story of the main character's experience in space and his double's experiences on earth are fasinating.    In a similar vein to Star Wars it gives viewers another chance to vicariously pretend to be a herioc star pilot like Luke Skywalker.    Well worth a viewing or two.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is a great movie, I bought two copies for my neices and nephews for Christmas.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Ben Affleck's adaptation of Dennis Lehane's book, Gone Baby Gone, is one of the best movies I have seen in years.    The basic story centers around two local detectives who reside in Dorchester.  They are asked to assist the police in their investigation of a missing girl, who was abducted while her alcoholic/drug addict mother was at her friend's place.  Reluctantly, they agree to take on the case.    Having read the book, the only complaint I would have is how they portayed Angela Gennaro, played by Michelle Monaghan.  In the book, her character has survived a physically abusive marriage and numerous brushes with death.  In this film, she is almost like a hood ornament to Casey Affleck's Patrick Kenzie.  But the chemistry between the two actors can almost make you forget about that.    The story moves at breakneck pace and keeps you in suspense until the very end.  Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are excellent as two police officers who are deeply involved in the case....and even deeper in secrets.  But the true standout is Golden Globe nominee, Amy Ryan, who plays the missing girl's mother.  You don't like her from the start, even though you feel tempted to feel some sympathy because of her situation.  Ryan plays this crass, ambivalent single parent with such raw power, you truly despise this woman.      The movie reflects on many famiilar themes; tight knit people who will \\"die with their secrets\\", things not appearing to be what they seem, the moral dilemma of doing what is right and what is \\"right\\", etc.  And by the end, you find yourself just as torn as Kenzie about which \\"right\\" will prevail.      You should probably read Deniis Lehane's prequels to this film such as \\"A Drink Before the War\\", \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\",  and \\"Sacred\\" before watching this film.  It will make you appreciate it even more.     A great film.  A truly \\"do not miss\\" film.
0525950079|2.0|I adored Pillars of the Earth.  But I have grown older since that book and I no longer have the same feelings obviously as I found this book long, very long, too long. I found some of the characters contrived and towards the end people disappeared one way or another to weave together a happy ending.  I love Ken Follet's books, but not this one, unfortunately.  Eye of the Needle and other books have been so superior to this one.
B000UR9TRS|5.0|If you don't mind a little cream in your jeans, buy this disk!  Incredible, amazing, spine tingling, I love it.  I used to own the DVD and the new HD DVD re-master blows this away.  Yes, this does have Dolby TrueHD surround sound.  You can hear Jimmy Page through all four speakers separately in Dazed and Confused.  The original DVD does not have true surround sound unlike the HD DVD.  You must buy it and hear it for yourself. Don't assume it will sound the same because it doesn't.  Very sharp reproduction, a minimal amount of dust, and looks and sounds like you have been sucked into a time warp back to 1973 in Madison Square Garden.  Feels like you are really there.  It gave me chills, it is so good.  Did I mention I'm a fan?  LOVE THESE GUYS!
B0007LCNKM|1.0|If by alligator you mean shell-shocked bacon strip of a reptile writhing lazily in a puddle, then yes, of course. It would have been nice if the studio manager had gotten some protein shakes into these fellows before they started recording. Yawn et cetera. Gawd, I feel like I'm back in Latin 101, lorded over by Bobo the Inneffective, his voice a loutish baritone, hairs filling every orifice and pore, forehead slathered in sweat, brow hairs pointing downward in an accusatory manner.<br /><br />Let me ask you a question: Do you like the idea of that guy who does the annoying voiceovers for car commercials fronting a band making music with what sound like Tonka toys? Matt Berninger makes the dude from Crash Test Dumbasses sound like the Velvet Frog. Is that McBrianEno wheezing in the background? Ben & Jerry hang-gliding and popping horse tranks, colostomy bags flapping in the breeze like hyperactive moths bathed in bulbs.
B000K15VSA|5.0|The 5-disc special edition, in the shape of Deckard's briefcase, is great for everyone who is a fan of the original novel, and/or all the versions of this movie and how they relate to the interpretation of the story.  The package contents are put together very well in the \\"briefcase\\", and who wouldn't love the chrome \\"origami\\" unicorn??  Fun packaging and content.    I think at around $60 this is a steal.  Five versions of the movie (including the messianic \\"Final Cut\\"), several documentaries including a new 3.5hour one, some art, and a few cool toys.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|We loved this movie in the theatre so much that we had to buy it as soon as it was available on dvd.  A very charming and witty movie that will inspire you to look up that recipe for ratatouille!
B000WZAE1I|3.0|It has some funny and fairy-like scenes. The are two disappointments. First, I don't see or feel the love between the 2 main characters. Second, overall, it does not feel like a fairy tale. It's more like a light comedy.    It's worth renting.
0446310786|5.0|Like many youngsters, I was assigned To Kill a Mockingbird to read as a 15 year old. Unlike most, however, the assignment was for speed reading class . . . rather than American Literature.<br /><br />Don't ever read this book for speed reading class.<br /><br />I always intended to get back to the book for a more leisurely reading that would allow me to take in the obvious brilliance of Harper Lee in more ways.  I was pleased to find that my local library offered an unabridged reading by Roses Prichard (an actress with a Ph.D. in Communications from the University of Southern California) for Books on Tape.<br /><br />In the first 15 seconds, I knew I had made a winning choice.  Roses Prichard turns Scout (Jean Louise) Finch into a girl you'll feel like you've known all your life.  Take the time to find this wonderful recording:  You'll discover more in this book than you've ever thought could be in a book describing the thoughts and experiences of a five- to eight-year-old narrator.<br /><br />Jem and Scout Finch are the only children of Atticus Finch, a highly principled lawyer in the small Southern town of Macomb, Alabama, whose wife died young of a heart attack. Unlike many novelists who cram their story into a few hours or days, Harper Lee showed the good sense to give us the family history and to let the children grow up over a few years before entering the heart of her tale. It's good story-telling and is great for character development.<br /><br />Jem is five years older than Scout but tolerates her company as long as she doesn't start acting like a girl.  That's fine with Scout who prefers overalls to dresses any day.  As Jem grows older, he finds himself taking on the role of protector as well.<br /><br />The children acquire a summer friend, Dill, and decide they want to meet the reclusive Arthur (Boo) Radley, a neighbor who always stays indoors.  They have many adventures that will remind you of Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher in Injun Joe's cave.<br /><br />The book is written in pre-Civil-Rights-era Alabama when consciousness of the bad things done to African Americans wasn't very well developed among those who weren't African Americans.  The only people in the story who seemed to appreciate the full horror of discrimination are those who are honestly trying to live the Christian life.  But even many practicing Christians proved to be blind to their African American neighbors' needs and concerns.<br /><br />Harper Lee does a fine job of skewering all of those who are hypocrites on the subject of race.  She even takes an appropriate shot at northerners who avoid the company of African Americans.<br /><br />In a way, this book was The Uncle Tom's Cabin of the Civil Rights Movement, developing the consciousness that helped to change some attitudes towards African Americans.<br /><br />The story also features lots of insights into Southern \\"justice\\" of the day -- inside the court, in the jury box, in jail, and in prison.  To bring the evils of the attitudes to bear, Harper Lee tells us that it's wrong to kill a mockingbird . . . they only sing for us to enjoy and don't do any harm.  By the end of the book, some of those in Macomb begin to feel that way about harmless human beings who do good, as well.<br /><br />You can learn more about Southern culture and attitudes in the early 1960s by reading this book than by studying a dozen nonfiction texts.  Harper Lee got it right.  One of the lightning rods for racial tension in those days was unwarranted sexual fear of African-American males.  That theme is fully developed through having an African-American be accused of raping a white woman.<br /><br />But what I think makes this book timeless is its focus on what it means to be a good person . . . the story of Atticus Finch and his struggles with being both a good man and a good father.<br /><br />But years from now you won't forget Scout:  She's one of the great heroines in American literature and an important prototype ofwhat the next generation should have become in loving other people.<br /><br />Appreciate the untapped potential all around you!preciate the untapped potential all around you!
6304981635|5.0|This is a mandatory, must have DVD for fans of Kung Fu flicks. You got everything here, exotic locations, cool characters, hot women, and a whole lot of Kung Fu Fighting.<br /><br />THe plot is simple enough and has been covered before. Bruce Lee is a Shalon monk who is recruited by police to investigate the island of Mr Han, who happens to be a renegade monk gone bad. He holds karate tournaments once every three years. The tournament is merely a cover for his real purposes. To find new talent to help him with his world wide drug and prostitution rings.<br /><br />I love this movie, but if I could make one change, or if I had the power to make an 'alternate ending' it would be this.......<br /><br />My personal favorite kung fu actor is Bolo Yeung, the 'Chinese Hercules'. He had a small role in this flick, but he was as scary as he always is. My idea would for him to have fought and killed Roper in his fight scene instead of getting bit on the leg and losing the fight. Then Bruce Lee would have to fight Bolo. Now THAT would have been exciting. Of course Bruce would have to kill Bolo. Then when Mr. Han sees that he loses his number one boy, then he could send all the karate guys to fight him. Of course as Bruce begins fighting them, that's when all the guys in the prisons are released and everybody gets in on the fun.<br /><br />Hi-Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!

B000Y1CWDS|3.0|As a huge fan of Spider-man 3 and deluxe super unnecessary edition DVDs I am warning you against this.    Aside from its attractive cover (which is basically attractive because it's just a bit different from the normal one), what value does this have?    Hardcore fans and movie buffs may like this one.  But most fans, like me, should just wait for the Spider-man 3.X edition, which will probably have unseen footage and much more special features.    Or spend an ebay-sized price on this and feel stupid when a real collectible edition comes out a few months from now.

B000Z0OX9O|2.0|...of Vangelis NOT releasing more often than not what is actually the soundtrack of the movie it's supposed to be.<br />Let's see here: we find, on CD 1, the exact same record we had in 1994 - but that was expected and announced, so why not. On CD 2, labelled \\"unreleased and bonus material from BR\\", there is, actually, very little music heard in the film itself, except from two cues that are well-know, namely \\"D & R duel\\", and \\"Tyrell's Death\\". That ends here. \\"Tyrell's Owl\\", for instance, is anything but the actual music as heard in the film at that moment. As for CD 3, it's nothing more than a hackneyed collection of muzak, with fashionable world music overtones and indistinct speech put in the mix, and absolutely doesn't justify the purchase of the set alone. I doubt I'll listen to it twice.<br /><br />All in all, I'm super tired of Vangelis NOT releasing, and never will now as it appears, the TRUE, ORIGINAL motion picture soundtrack of Blade Runner. Whatever artistic endeavour there was behind this project, it still is NOT, far from it, the ultimate ressource for BR music, I'm sorry to say. It's different music for the most part, perhaps to some pleasant or good music, but not the BR soundtrack by a long margin.<br /><br />One word of advice: Keep your Deck Arts bootlegs preciously... They are the most comprehensive collection of BR music that were ever made.<br /><br />This record set isn't.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|I was looking for a simple parking garage with ramps and multiple levels for my son to use with his cars.  This is great and it's cute to boot.  It doesn't come with all of the extras in the picture, but I was aware of that before I bought it so I didn't care.  My son is a little too young to figure out the elevator, but he loves watching me or other kids use it.  One tip is to build it before you give it to your kids and use wood glue to secure it together.  The ramps aren't permanently attached and I would've liked to have glued them on before he figured out that they come off.  Also,  the screw to the gas station got stripped while some other older kids were playing with it, but we glued it back in and it seems to work just fine.  A great overall product that just needs some minor tweeking.
1582701709|1.0|I skimmed through this book while at the bookstore, wondering what new crap the new age self-help machine had generated. Thoughts can be influential to be sure, but only to a degree. I know that many times I have had very positive thoughts about something that never materialized. However, I can see why something like this would be more popular than another blockbuster book, titled the Bible, because in that guidebook Jesus Himself said that life will be difficult. Who would want THAT, when we could have fame and fortune instead. It is so disappointing that so many people in the US have bought this book, and into this lie. But then again, we ARE the fast food kings of the world.
B00000DGSN|5.0|Made in Japan may be the best live album recorded during the early 1970's. The Mark III line-up was the actual Deep Purple as we know them today. The early versions with Nic Simper and Rod Evans, along with the later Mark IV version with Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale were competent and produced good music with a few classics, but Deep Purple was Ian Gillan, Richie Blackmore, Jon Lord, Roger Glover, and Ian Paice. This album is a tribute to how good musicians once were, how well they could learn to play together, and they defined what a band must do to be established as a great live band. All of this during a time where the group grappled with extreme personality clashes amongst themselves.     Starting with the brilliant and understated opening of Highway Star, you know within a few minutes that this is a great CD. The guitar solo in this cut actually involves Blackmore playing through one passage with his hand above the neck which left young impressionable guitarists gasping in awe for those lucky enough to have seen it. Gillan, with his very unique and sometimes totally annoying voice is as much a part of the DP sound as Jon Lord's Marshall driven keyboards. The stolid talent of Roger Glover and Ian Paice's \\"Buddy Rich does hard rock chops\\" all contributed to the overall sound which is captured authentically on this CD.     Although all the cuts on this album are worthy of listening over and over, the standouts are the inventive version of the overplayed Smoke on the Water, and the crowning achievment Child in Time. The latter, once you get through Gillan's oddly engaging screaming, treats the listener to a short but effective keyboard solo, and then ascends into one of the single most brilliant instrumentals ever played during the rock era. It is doubtful that any of the garage bands turned mega-stars could manage to cover this tune, much less duplicate the original musicality. The guitar solo is absolutely brilliant, soaring time and time again to where it isalmost physically unimaginable, shows why to this day no great guitarist lists are complete without Blackmore. Underneath it is a very solid and understated Jon Lord and the incredible drive of Paice and Glover playing in a style reminiscent of a hard rock version of one of the 1940's swing bands. Just to listen to this one instrumental, which at the conclusion leaves the audience silently awe-struck is worth owning the CD.   Neither of the encores are really much to mention, but the added treat of the lively Strange Kind of Woman makes this CD one of the best rock albums ever recorded. If there was a band that could compete with the Mark III line-up of Deep Purple, I must have missed them as none come to mind. This group clearly paved the way for ELP, Kansas, Rush, and the other major concert bands who followed.
0143038419|1.0|This is a sad, pathetic excuse for a book and a woman.  The other critical reviews capture some of the best descriptions: boring, seemingly fabricated storyline; self-absorbed, narcissistic author unable to deal with normal life issues.  Many in my book club couldn't stomach finishing it.  We need to get this book off our book club lists.
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|Very nice, never seen before such incredibles fightings scenes with the best picture to appreciate this kind of film. The last film with so many incredible violence in the fights was definitly \\"braveheart\\", until... \\"TROY\\".   Thanks a lot for the pleasure of entertaining.

B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|I Purchased my copy yesterday and can confirm the video is in 3D, for those who say it isn't get your eyes checked. The music is presented in standard 2.0, and sounds clearer with more bass then the previous 2 music DVD's Tool released.<br />The packaging is similar to 10,000 days, it's presented in a thick cardboard 3 panel digipak with the 3D glasses attached to view the 4  separate art cards that are included, the inside panel has the skeleton from the video in 3D.<br />The features include a Documentary on people who know Adam and what work they have done with him, a Doco on Alex Gray' art Studio, and a 2 very funny commentary's.<br />Now the video itself, if you haven't seen it your missing out, it is absolutely stunning, the visuals are breathtaking in 3D, the colours and images jump out of your TV, (just wait until you see the 2 creatures slowly coming out of the mans eyes to see what I'm talking about) I was glued to the screen for the entire clip & with the Vicarious soundtrack it will just blow you away, this is what Tool fans have been waiting for... not worthy of a 5 star review id give it 100 if possible, this is a work of art!<br />BTW I haven't found any \\"live footage\\"
0634049011|3.0|The book was great going, till it hit chapter #7. Suddenly, without explaining as to how, it asked to create boxed major scale patters on root pattern theory , and i was all lost.<br /><br />I would still recommend this book to everyone, as it really gives you confidence that you know something about theory, and gives you a feel for your fret board. But, be aware, that sections of this book might require some external personal lessons, or online research.
1559408898|5.0|Robocop Criterion Collection.<br />I'm reviewing the Criterion version of Paul Verhoevens Robocop as I believe it is still the best version of the film your going to find. As for the movie you know what your in for, it's Robocop, In your face cartoon violence, bad language, social commentary, 80's style fashion & humour, and who can forget the news clips make it a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />The picture Quality and Sound presentation would be scrutinized for being at best average, by today's standards.<br />Presented in 2.0 the dialogue is strong, whilst the action scenes do need a little more balls they still hold up pretty well with a decent sub woofer, the picture quality is just as good, sharpness & colours are as perfect as you could expect it doesn't bleed, & the picture isn't washed out like the 1st Robocop release on MGM DVD.<br /><br />I just prefer this version to the really bad remastered pressings as the added violent scenes don't stand out in picture quality like the new pressings do.<br />I.E. the last scene in the movie when Clarence gets stabbed in the neck by Robo is all sharp and clean, then the shot when Clarence is staggering around holding his neck it looks all VHS.<br />The Criterion pressing has no such occurrences the film stays the same form beginning to end.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I waited to review this album, because like some, i was a bit disappointed too. But i told myself i would wait and see what direction the album took me in, and i have to say, this was the perfect album for Wilco to make at this point in their career, they couldn't have done another Y.H.F. or A.G.I.B. nor did they return to their roots, it doesnt sound like their first 3 records, it sounds like a completely different band/songwriter and isn't that what we want from our musical leaders? I know i do. Anyways, i am absolutly in love with Sky Blue Sky, it really does feel like being wrapped in a blanket, it is one of the warmest sounding records i have ever heard, it truly is, i have heard people saying that before but i never truly understood it until S.B.S. The Songs are some of the best of their career and it is truly a great record for the Ages. Show me another band that can take over someone's life, has a wild/exciting back catalog, puts on a great live show, and is not concerned with being lame rockstars and i will delete my review. A+. Thank You For Your Time. Buy Wilco's Sky Blue Sky.
B000VECAEO|5.0|Firstly, for anyone who missed Jerry's appearance on The Daily Show last month he told Jon Stewart that he has one last scene (not a full episode) that he wants to do soon. He couldn't get it on this set because of all The Bee Movie work, but we will get once last taste.    Anyway... on to my review;    Without Larry David around, the most die-hard fan would have to say that the show suffered a little in the last 2 seasons. BUT some decent Seinfeld is still better than anything else out there. There will be lines that will forever live in our brains probably long after we forget where they were came from.    On the whole, we were disappointed with the finale, even with Larry David back, it didn't quite live up to the end of a masterpiece. But then I thought about it. This was really the only way to end everything. Even Larry David said it was pretty pretty pretty clear what had to happen here. They had to go out on the exact same line that started the pilot. It's been 9 years, they've been through everything together and they have learned ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Jerry will never find a girlfriend that he can't find a fault, if it's the toothbrush, the man hands, the same clothes everyday, some Newman dumped, someone exactly like him or even someone who his parents approve of.    I can't wait to see what scene Jerry felt would complete the series. It should have been on this set, but the extras are as fantastic as they have been for the last 7 sets. Most shows dump their episodes onto discs, photoshot a menu and ship it. I mainly buy them for the extras since I can practicly recite the lines to most episodes and they have gone above and beyond with these extras.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Those who re-mastered this film were absolutely at their best.  It should have looked this goood in the 60's
B000LXH0AE|4.0|What an intriguing concept - an ordinary if somewhat introverted man who, unbeknownst to himself, is actually a character in a novel-in-progress, and a novelist whose character, unbeknownst to her,  is real. Not an easy story to write or film. Nevertheless, both have been done, and done well. The screenplay makes the whole thing comprehensible, and the stellar acting makes it believable. It was hard to accept that this restrained actor is Will Ferrell. He DOES have talent, and a bit of that goofy leading man quality! The talents of Dustin Hoffman, Latifah, and Emma Thompson are indisputable, and it's a treat to see them in such strong supporting roles. Part drama, part comedy, part romance, this little movie has so much going for it.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|I bought this DVD as a gift for my husband after we had seen the movie.  All the Ocean movies have been exciting and this one is as well.  I enjoyed seeing the characters develop through the three movies.  But I missed Julia Roberts this time around.

B0000027EP|5.0|This is the record that got me into Motorhead, and I still consider it their best more than fifteen years later. One thing you'll notice immediately about '1916'- it's loud. VERY loud. Your mother will tell you to turn it down, no matter if she's three rooms or three states away. If your ears can stand to listen to it all the way through, you'll notice it's one of the band's most diverse offerings. Punk, rockabilly, and blues are covered to varying degrees here, all done masterfully, and with humorous lyrics on some. It has a rare Motorhead ballad, 'Love Me Forever', and finishes up with the gritty war tune that lends the record its title. 'Overkill' is by far their best older album but I really think Motorhead have yet to better '1916' for quality- and volume.
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|Blow-Up is a look at a London that may or may not have existed. It is rather slowly paced at first with a lot of emphasis in setting up a mood, the Mod mood, with a lot of seemingly irrelevant material. The cover photo on the sleeve is one example, showing the photographer in an action which has nothing to do with the main plot. When the movie gets down to the real story, things things pick up considerably.   In the end, the movie does create an atmosphere of mystery. The movie is better seen twice to get things in perspective.
0375836675|5.0|Meet Ed Kennedy. He's that sweet guy with the unimpressive job, whose life is all around mediocre. We've all met Ed at one point or another. The question is are we brave enough to be him? I Am the Messenger is seemingly about a young man who accidently catches a criminal and recieves cards in the mail by an unknown sender. But really is the story of an everyday person changing the world around him driven by an indefinite power.  An all around inspiring book that maintains a funny and loveable narrator; as well as some noteworthy people, and a dog named The Doorman.
1563898586|5.0|Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill have taken several Victorian stories and loosely blended the main characters into a single well-plotted, supremely drawn novel.  It is a unique treatment, as far as I know, and way better than the movie.  The heroes are actually semi-reformed villains, and the story is richer for that.  If you've outgrown the DC and Marvel universe, and wanted something more (or is it Moore?) League is definitely for you.  The characters are well-drawn, both literally and literarily.  This is an adult graphic novel, not just because of the frank dipictions of sex and violence, but because of the emotions and characterization.  Why, some of the main characters are even middle-aged!  You will recognize the aura of some classic stories, but even if you don't, \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" is definitely worth the price of admission.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|This performance shows how forward thinking they have been in their music and despite the monotony of some original releases, they have layered and fused tracks into a truly moving and soulful thumping, riffing, mooging, feedback-squwarking frenzy. This is an amazing energizing reproduction of the best of Daft Punk, quite simply at their very best. Thomas and Guy Manuel, have always wanted to make good music for people to like and dance to. Now they have trumped themselves with a fantastic world concert tour, the only question remains, when will they release a concert DVD!!!!??? PLEASE!    I flew from Dallas, Texas to Melbourne Australia to witness the live spectacle, it was beyond words -one simply has to see and experience the energy of a crowd of 20,000 focused on two robots in a pyramid. This release gives you an idea of what that's like. Buy this for someone you love that loves Daft Punk, but they'll probably have it already :)
140120306X|5.0|Well, what can one say about a graphic novel that uses every possible kind of illustration, story-telling technique, and a truly interdimensional blockbuster ending?  There's even a pair of 3D glasses for reading the last dozen pages or so - this will blow your mind!  Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill have dropped all pretense that this is just another graphic novel.  They are intent on taking the reader/viewer to places where no graphic novel has gone before.  I found their use of another universe especially interesting, since I did the same thing in Book Two of my own two part novel, Neitherworld (also on Amazon).  The authors and their substantial collaborators - both in number and skill - have created something utterly unique - a book that is almost the definitive work of other classics - such as Fanny Hill, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's dream, Greek god and various farrie tales throughout the ages.  Until now, I didn't know such stories needed pulling together - now I know better.  The only thing that suffers, however, is the tightness of the narrative.  With so many sub-stories, contained within the ecclectic \\"Black Dossier\\" which the main characters are reading along with us, the reader (us, not Wilhelmina Murray and Alan Quartermain Jr.) one goes carreening from tale to tale like a literate billiard ball, never quite sure what bank or ball one will be bounced from next.  It is a wild ride, but definitely worth it.  I do think this is the end of the series though - it's very hard to imagine what the authors could do for an encore.
B0002199H2|5.0|Shame you can barely find this is in the metal encased box as it was originally released. Glad I snatched it up when it came out in 1997. This is the first RELEASED Columbia boxes that took from 1997 until 2007 to complete. Chronologically , it would be the 2nd box. Fabulous sound on this reissue. The people who put this entire series together did so with extreme care and meticulous detail.The music ? C'mon , it's MILES...put it in your shopping cart !
6304698690|4.0|I was disappointed that the version I received was edited, though probably only for length.  There was one single feature that I have always recalled with fondness in this movie.  When the young young scottish maid was surprised at a book the cousins were reading she pronounced it as \\"boo -k\\" like \\"root\\".  Then I noticed her repeatedlly using that pronounciation.  In this release, that entire sequence was missing?  Having lived in different European countries as a child, I find the unique pronounciation of words by people living in the same place fascinating.  As in the way some Irish-Americans pronounce \\"oi\\" as \\"er\\" and \\"er\\" as \\"oi\\".  Remember Archie Bunker from the \\"All in the Family\\" TV series?  He's a stereotyped example, but a good one.  \\"Just rub some erl on it!\\"  Yet the name Earl is inevitably pronounced, \\"Oil\\".  I once worked with a fellow who did the same.  And yet, after years of associating with people who pronounce it in the local accent, he never changed.  But, getting to the point,  wonder why they left her dialogue out of the DVD?
B000WZAE1I|4.0|In an unfortunate piece of business and interestingly ironic future, Stardust's theatrical release coincided with the unnecessary-and-unfunny Rush Hour 3 only to have its DVD release coincide with the godawful Halloween remake and the heavily-marketed Simpsons movie. Good movies just can't win which is unfortunate since the film, aside from a few things, is quite charming and quite a delight to watch and in a rare piece of business for a film, kept me entertained the entire 2 hours it was on.    Tristan is a young, awkward man who has his eyes set on the beautiful-but-incredibly-shallow Victoria who has her eyes on Humphrey. Wanting to prove his life, Tristan decides to cross the mysterious Wall and bring back the shooting star they both just saw within a week. But turns out the falling star is actually Yvaine, a beautiful young woman whose very heart holds the key to eternal life and stone holds the key to the kingdom for competing princes. With the help of a rather unique pirate, Tristan and Yvaine tries to evade practically everybody and get home.     With all of the fantasy adaptations like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Golden Compass, Chronicles of Narnia and the upcoming Spiderwick Chronicles (phew!), it's nice to see Stardust that manages to entertain the audience without playing down the humor or making it \\"safe\\". Sure some things don't make sense or not given enough explanation (what is the purpose and the marketing value of lightning anyway?) but the film rarely, if ever, gets boring and some scenes, including one sword fight at the end of the film, is actually quite hilarious.     Casting is all-around top notch as well with Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert de Niro and Claire Danes (but what is UP with giving her little to no eyebrows?) all do splendid work, the effects work is great and it's even got a rousing score. It's unfortunate that Stardust will most likely get double-dipped since the special features are rather miniscule but the film should be enoughto get people watching anyway.    Avoid Halloween like the plague and get this along with the Simpsons movie and you'll have some of the biggest fun during the holidays.

This should be on every citizens bookshelf. You should have to read it before you vote. It is all important. Whatever else you are doing stop...pick up this book and read it.
B000PMG9S0|5.0|Blind Guardian's \\"Imaginations From The Other Side\\" is my favorite Blind Guardian CD as well as one of my favorites in general not just in power metal. Blind Guardian mixes traditional speed metal sounds with melodic guitar riffs and leads that blend together with the dynamic vocals of Mr. Hansi Kursch. To me they are one of the most unique of all power metal bands - they don't sound like typical power metal bands like HammerFall or Gamma Ray with high clean register vocals. Hansi has a strong melodic throaty vocal style that still sounds melodic. Blind Guardian also mixes medieval style music as heard in the melody of the vocals and acoustic guitar in \\"A Past And Future Secret.\\" You also get some dark sounding tunes like \\"Imaginations From The Other Side\\" and speed metal as well with \\"I'm Alive.\\" Blind Guardian is a power metal band who's music does not sound samey throughout - they have a good mixture of fast and slow songs to midtempo as well as a variant structure in songs and melody. \\"Imaginations...\\" was their album that continued to define their distinctive style following \\"Somewhere Far Beyond.\\" This album is fairly more melodic than \\"Somewhere Far Beyond\\" which was more melodic and variant compared to the works that came before that. 5 stars for the album content.    The 2007 remaster gives the entire album a boost in volume although I admit the album did not need remastering as the sound quality was already great - this just turns the volume up to make it a bit louder, and you get 3 demo songs. Still overall great album! Highly recommended for all Blind Guardian fans and metal fans especially those of power metal.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|Well well well. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 is because I love Spiderman and the fight scenes were passable. I don't want to give away any of the movie here so I can not write why I really hate this movie. In the end I will say this, when Peter has Venom his hair becomes Emo. UMMMM , WHAT!?!?!? Venom = emo hair. I am lost with that math. Well I really love Spiderman so I hope they go back to the basics and make a good 4th movie that you know follows the comics better.
B00005JPTI|2.0|Just a warning, there may be spoilers in this review. You are warned.  Let's be honest everyone speaks of this movie as an adaptation of the book, but in hollywood the only adaptation to speak of is the fact that this is a remake of the Omega Man and everyone knows it. Remakes or sequals.. This is how the industry works. Now for the review....  This movie had suspense and sadness. Will Smith handles being the only black man left on earth well. With his mind slipping away due to loneliness, the inability to cope with the loss of his family and fear for his life; a general self-interest, guilt, and need to just survive becomes so much more.  This film is shown from his perspective of his current situation and his flashbacks of the last moments with his family. The cockiness and almost sociopathic (sp) behavor seen in the omega man has been replaced by a real person here. Until the moment the first infected person screams and attacks Neville I was involved and part of the fear, then the reminiscent CGI and movement from i robot came back and it was over for me. The infected looked like skin bag versions of the i robots and the Mummy from well... the mummy who made the same lame looking mouth contortions. Was there some reason they couldn't splurge on some extras and some make up in this movie? Every zombie movie, 28 days later and others were so much more frightening because they were real people, the human quality is what is most frightening and what the irony of the infection is supposed to mean > it could happen to us. However I don't think I will get an infection that will turn me or a dog into bad CGI hairless monkeys that can bust through a brick wall. On the upside Will Smith saves every scene of this movie he is in. His emotion in the video store when he breaks down finally in sorrow was a gem. It worked on more than one level and I felt made a much larger comment that I hope people can see.. On the other hand his dog was in it's own way and great character which isn't to say anything about anyone but the dog and the shooting of the dog. It had a face that made you care about and feel for and miss when she died the way she did. I thought on one hand it needed to die to push him over the edge (instead of the boy in omega man) on the other hand I sorely missed it's presence in the film and wished it could have lived which everyone wanted i think. The leader of the pack of infected was confusing to me, what did it want and why was not clear even though we are told they are mindless killers, clearly if they run in packs and communicate, then they are not mindless by any means. This was left to much to speculation I felt. If they are supposed to be human and the end result was to cure them, you are not left wanting or needing such a result. The ending felt forced, sappy and token. This women and her child that show up had the make of a stephen king crowd of token religious minority characters that show up to give the message of god and die or save everyone. It felt like she had more experience with the world gone crazy than Neville did and in a way she hijacked the movie. In a way this was like religion showing up and validating Nevilles character more than his general compassion and scientific need to make right what humans had done which was more the truth than the god's wrath and swing away (signs[movie]) realization that came and the tail end of this movie.  So to wrap things up the good things about this movie -   *Everything with Will Smith  *Neville's Dog  *The video store emotional breakdown in particular  The bad things about this movie  *the CGI infected  *The token mother at the end with the spiritual message  This film was given 2 stars because of the bad parts and because many of the scenes were not from the book or the Omega man but from 28 days later, in my opinion - they should have borrowed more...
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This album is not only horrible, it made me lose my hearing for about 3 days, I had to go get my ears checked, seriously now, NO JOKE!    I used to be a huge fan of LP, but this is the worst music I have heard... BAD! REALLY BAD! Instead of moving ahead, Linkin Park steps back and into the darkness, and I mean the DARKNESS, not the evil kind, the other kind of DARKNESS, the NON-MANLY darkness...    Just don't waste your money, listen to the radio... or burn a copy of your friend's CD, it's THAT BAD!

B00003CXMG|4.0|I just read [[ASIN:1556526687 Let's Spend the Night Together: Backstage Secrets of Rock Muses and Supergroupies]], by Pamela Des Barres, and one of the chapters was an interview with director Carmeron Crowe. There are 2 dozen interviews, and there is only one other male interviewed, male groupie Pleather. The book chronicles the exploits of groupie's, from Mary Magdalen, through Tura Satana, Pamela herself, Cynthia Plaster Caster, Gail Zappa, Sweet, Sweet Connie of Little Rock, Lori Lightning, Bebe Buell, and Pleasant Gehman, among others. The reason for the inclusion of Cameron is for the film, Almost Famous, and the character of Penny Lane, played by Kate Hudson. She is NOT a groupie, she is a Band-Aid, and the young journalist, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), in an early scene in the film, also claims he is NOT a groupie. I recently emailed Tura Satana, and she also claimed she wasn't a groupie either. She just happened to have had a fling with Elvis, among others. Sure, Tura wasn't a groupie, and maybe you could even say that Elvis was her groupie. Penny Lane, the non-groupie character in Almost Famous, says that groupies do it for the thrill of getting close to someone famous, but \\"Band-Aids\\" do it for the love of the music. A better term for them is \\"Muse\\" as in someone who inspires an Artist or Musician.<br /><br />Anywhat, Almost Famous is mostly a thinly veiled autobiography of Cameron Crowe, the film director who began writing for Rolling Stone at the tender age of 16. After such an auspicious beginning, he went on to direct<br />[[ASIN:B00008G7UK Say Anything]], [[ASIN:0800141741 Jerry Maguire]], [[ASIN:B00005JKMZ Vanilla Sky]], [[ASIN:6305283516 Singles]], and [[ASIN:B00029RTCG Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Widescreen Special Edition)]].<br /><br />Penny Lane, Polexia Aphrodisia (Anna Paquin), and the other women are somewhat peripheral. Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand), his mother, and his older sister Anita Miller (Zooey Deschanel), play just as pivotal a role in the young auteur's rite of passage. Mother and daughter can't get along, but before she splits to become a Stewardess, older sister leaves him a stash of Rock Albums that will transform his life. Important male figures are Rock Critic/mentor Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Rolling Stone editors Ben Fong-Torres and Jan Wenner, and the members of Stillwater, who the young journalist is desperately trying to interview for his first feature story.<br /><br />The band Stillwater is totally fictional, yet they are somewhat of an amalgamation of The Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin, say around the time of [[ASIN:B000003CMC Eat a Peach]] and [[ASIN:B000002J09 Led Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO)]]. Probably more Allman Brothers, though not nearly as Southern, with a charismatic guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), representing Duanne Allman, and a talented, though overshadowed, lead singer--shades of Greg Allman--Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee).<br /><br />Jason Lee is of course very familiar from the TV show My Name is Earl, but eerily, he also plays David Seville, manager of The Chipmonks, in the recent remake of that seminal prototype to The Monkees, The Archies, Josie and the Pussycats, Gorrilaz, and other pop music/cartoon, and/or television projects. What is eerie about it is that the opening scene of Almost Famous, the first music heard, is actually the aforementioned Chipmonks, as the young William Miller (Michael Angarano) listens on the radio. Back to Jason Lee, though, he not only sang well, he also acted his part superbly, bristling in the shadow of egomaniac Russell Hammond. Crudup's character is revealed when he attends a party with some mid-west locals, takes a psychedelic drug, and jumps off the house into a swimming pool, proclaiming \\"I am a Golden God.\\"<br /><br />The DVD includes as a bonus some of Cameron's articles written for Rolling Stone, and they really shed a lot of light on the subject. The Allman Brothers story is written after Duanne Allman's fatal motorcycle accident. Perhaps, then, the Russell Hammond character is based on Jimmy Page, as another important interview of the young scribe was done of Led Zeppelin, who despite their huge success and tremendous album sales, were continuously slagged by critics, chief amongst them, Rolling Stone. There is a lot of mistrust and animus between musician and journalist. When they meet, they nickname him Enemy. Meanwhile, mentor Lester Bangs warns him, whatever you do, don't become their friend.<br /><br />The music for Stillwater was written by Cameron and his wife, Nancy Wilson, of female heavy metal group, Heart. The actors who played the band, Stillwater, were coached by Peter Frampton, who actually got them ready to perform within a few months with a little intense Rock Star Fantasy Boot Camp training. One of the Rolling Stone interviews is of Frampton, just after the huge success of [[ASIN:B000009HF2 Frampton Comes Alive!]], and just prior to the release of the ill-advised film [[ASIN:B00009APB6 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]. In the preface to that interview, he confesses that he broke the cardinal rule of Rock Journalism, as laid down by Lester Bangs: Don't befriend the musicians. Knowing what a fiasco and career wrecker the movie would be, one can only wonder why he would let his so-called friend make such a disastrous movie. But the amiable Frampton took his success in stride, and seems to have also taken his subsequent fall from grace quite well.<br /><br />But I digress, and just let me say here that the inclusion of the Rolling Stone articles is quite a bonus, as they not only illuminate what goes on in the movie, but also validate the protagonist's saga. Because, if he had sucked as a writer, what a silly story that would have been. But the writing is very impressive, and all the more so when you consider the author's tender age.<br /><br />Patrick Fugit, playing the Cameron Crowe/William Miller character does a fantastic job of acting as well. He yearns to be cool, but he is so not. He has a crush on Penny Lane, and one scene where he is deflowered by some of the other \\"groupies\\" is quite tastefully handled, well-acted, and what is most striking is that he makes eye contact with Penny Lane throughout, and you feel that there is some kind of strange love between them, however unrequited it may be. Another scene has Penny asking him if he wants to go to Morocco with her, and he says \\"Yes,\\" then asks her to ask him again. It was later revealed in the \\"Making of\\" footage that he was asking for another take, but they left it in because it was spontaneous and captured an ethereal quality of yearning. Another scene that shows Crowe's skill as a director was one in which Penny Lane (whose real name is finally revealed as Lady Goodman) is smashed on qualudes. As she rolls around vomiting in her diaphanous lingerie, and the young journalist calls for emergency medical assistance, the soundtrack plays Stevie Wonder singing My Cherie Amour. He can't help loving her, in spite of it all. It is just this sort of juxtaposition that makes the mise en sc&egrave;ne of auteur Cameron Crowe unique, and why watching any of his films is always such an enjoyable experience.then, the Russell Hammond character is based on Jimmy Page, as another important interview of the young scribe was done of Led Zeppelin, who despite their huge success and tremendous album sales, were continuously slagged by critics, chief amongst them, Rolling Stone.

B00006I53S|1.0|I'm not normally one to give any product a bad rating. For most things, if I don't like it, I discard it, and go on my way. But I bought this lens on the strengths of the Amazon reviews, and if I can help someone else avoid the same decision I made, it is worth it.    Many reviews here seem to indicate that this lens is every bit as good as an L lens. That just isn't the case. If you need the L quality, this lens isn't going to give it to you.  The sharpness and contrast that you expect with an L lens are missing from this lens.    Now, if your primary concerns are price, and the only lens you have is the kit lens that came with your camera, this might be a great choice for you. As other reviewers have stated, the IS is a nice addition to a lens, and the image is probably acceptable for casual shooters.  The zoom range is good for using this as a walk-around lens.    I had really hoped that the lens could compete with other L lenses, because I needed a good walk-around lens. This one seemed to fit my needs, and at a great price, too.  But the images just don't measure up to the standards that I am used to.  For me, it is more important to have outstanding image quality than any other features in a lens. The 28-135 IS just doesn't deliver, and so this lens is not staying on my camera.

0439813786|5.0|Ala-Kazam ... Abra-cadabra ... Voila.  Hugo Cabret is AMAZING!!  I read this book in about 3.5 hours, since I am only an average reader.  But despite my mediocre reading skills, I must confess that I simply could NOT put this book down.   And I must read it again tout a suite!    Now, when I say that this book is \\"amazing,\\"  I do not mean to hackney the word.   I say it because this book is \\"MAGICAL\\" in more than one way, and is superlative in multifarious ways.  Allow me to elucidate:  1.  For those who like books which are pure FUN and free from the banalised \\"sophistications\\" which are so very ubiquitous in many of   todays \\"children's books,\\"  this book is a BREATH of Fresh Air.  Parents, you can feel free to let your child read \\"at will\\" without  fear of them serendipitously receiving a 16-year old's social education.  None of that tripe in this book.    2.  For you movie lovers (like me), this book honours one of the earliest pioneers and trail-blazers in motion pictures.         3.  For you who love the CLEVER ARTS, such as sleight-of-hand, this is a nod of the head to that fine science.   Very finely done magic is always compelling, and this book shows what FUN it can be.    4.  For you who enjoy what we call a good Bildungsroman novel will enjoy this book.   Why?  It is so VERY finely BALANCED.   The main character, Hugo is not your average 12-year old with humdrum experiences.   He is pressed into surpassing most children his age due to his dire circumstances.   He had to learn new things in order to survive.   And yet, he is equally sensitive, conscientious, and works hard at being responsible, despite his entrenched habit for petty thievery.  Hugo is one of the most 3-dimensional characters I have ever run across.  He literally LEAPS OFF the page to the reader.   By this time, the reader no longer sees words on the pages, but IMAGES only, and I am not talking about Selznick's illustratiions, either.    5.  The final 2 chapters are innovative on the STORYLINE-level.  I cannot give away the plot, but Oooooh!!  I love the juicy twists at the   latter sections of this fun, fun romp!    6.  For those who are like me who have a 12-year old kid living inside of an adult body (as it were), you love COOL \\"Hidey-hole\\" passages, Hidden stairways, Maizes, or Nifty Hangouts which NO one knows about.   You MUST read this book.  It satisfies the longing for the Mysterious and also the longing for SAFETY.  Without doubt, there HAVE been people who have lived in World-class cities who dwelt in sub-levels or sub-terrainian areas UNSEEN to the untrained eye.  My relish for the combination of unseen realms in connexion to safe-havens is gorgeously met in this book.    7.   Lastly, Selznick is also conscientious.   He is a writer who considers DETAILS important.   So do I.  Details is where QUALITY is normally found in most any well-constructed, creative venture.  In this instance, something as secondary as the book's dust-jacket simply GRABS you, with Hugo's face doing the labour.  What it amounts to is a three-quarter view of the Hugo's face between the spine and p. [4], of the Cover.  It is VERY innovative . . . and such a real face with deep longing and wistful dreams in his lucid eyes.

If you enjoy the Hives you will love this album, hell you'll love it even if you didn't think you liked The Hives.  Thankfully The Hives have enough skill to not stray too far from their original style yet still stay fresh and keep your interest. There is nothing worse than buying album after album from a band to find out that they all sound exactly the same or on the other hand every album sounds like a new band. The Hives are not one of those run of the mill cookie cutter bands. If you haven't bought this buy it now.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I got this and Killadelphia signed at ozzfest both my favorite dvd and cd from them.  New American Gospel ranks up there also.  My most favorite band beside Devildriver (Which Dez is one of the nicest people I have ever met.)  I love Randys growls and the heavy riffs.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|The story is wonderful - the lifelong quest of William Wilberforce to abolish the slave trade. He faced numerous obstacles in his quest and suffered the strains in body, mind, and spirit, yet ultimately succeeded.        Unfortunately, the script writers chose to scimp on events in Mr. Wilberforce's life that gave his life depth. Three examples should suffice.         Under the orders of his physician, he used opium for years to combat \\"colitis.\\" Opium addiction, like modern narcotic addiction, can be devastating. Yet the only effect the script writers felt important to highlight was Mr. Wilberforce's desire to give up opium in order to keep his mind clear for the coming battles over the slave trade. His mind was clouded? The movie never showed this effect. Was his life or relationships affected in any other way? The movie is silent.         The scenes showing Mr. Wilberforce's friendship with Mr. Pitt early in their careers are wonderful. Showing them race through the gardens like young lads before Mr. Pitt rose to the post of Prime Minister was a stroke of brilliance. However, simply noting that they had become estranged, as they remarked each other at Mr. Wilberforce's wedding, did not do justice to the depth of their friendship.         Why would Lord Tarleton have taken excpetion to Mr. Wilberforce's use of the term \\"the people\\" when he presented his anti-slave trade petition to parliament? The movie only hints at the reason, and it was much more complex than Lord Tarleton having fought in the Revolutionary War against the Americans and having lost two fingers. Since the movie presents Lord Tarleton as the principal person who thwarted Mr. Wilberforce's attempts to abolish the slave trade, presenting his complex character as a simple caricature diminished Mr. Wilberforce's achievement.    In summary: A wonderful story about an extraordinary man. Though the film ultimately falls short of telling his story, it is still a compelling movie.
0767819659|5.0|Great movie.  My daughter loves it!  Just as if Madeline had come to life!  Frances McDormand is fabulous as Miss Clavel!
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I am a fan of Nicolas Cage. However, this movie does not use his talents. He seems bemused as he tries to give meaning to the character of Frank Cadillac. Jessica Biel is only used as eye candy in the movie; her character is never given any depth.        Compounding the poor character development, several logic problems arise in the storyline. And, as othe reviewers have noted, the ending is more of a trick on the viewer than a twist.        So why did I give the movie four stars instead of three of less? The action scenes are wonderful. Mr. Cage is at his best when the movie adds comic overtones, such as when Mr. Cage first meets Ms. Biel.        Flawed but fun.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|Nice selection of songs for a 2 cd set. Nice price and free shipping. Add this to your Led Zep collection.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I loved it! This film is very intence exspecialy when in a state of mind that is altered with drugs!
B000V7B90C|4.0|Good dvd (set of 2) for the price and free shipping.  Delivered on time. Enjoyed watching AC DC from the early days with Bon Scott, and also Brian Johnson with more current concert footage. If you like AC DC, you like this DVD.

1401300529|5.0|Brilliant! Engrossing. Like most people I knew very little about the Korean War except from what I absorbed watching MASH, my dad served in Korea but he never talked much about it, at times he would talk about WWII but never Korea. Now maybe, I understand why. Halberstam brilliantly details the political environment of a post WWII world where America is trying to find it's feet as the new World leader of democracy and as the principle defender against the spread of Communism. While it's people yearn for isolationism, a civil war in China led by Mao brings the US into conflicts in parts of the world where we are ill-prepared to fight. The political conflicts, the battles and people of the Korean War are vividly and in incredible detail are brought to life by this incredible book.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Have not had a lot of time to use the flash yet, but the few times I did use it it was simple to use and produced good results.
0525950079|5.0|Many novels are slow to start as they lay the foundations for what is to come later, but right from the opening pages this novel is likely to suck you in and make you not want to put it down. The novel is set in a 14th Century town and the surrounding villages.  Though it is a sequel to a previous novel, the setting is quite a bit later in time and it is not at all necessary to have read the earlier book in order to be able to enjoy this one. The novel is brimming with fascinating intrigue and torrid love affairs. Novels of this kind set in the present can often descend to the level of a mere soap opera and become uninteresting. Here the power relationships inherent in the medieval setting make the Machiavellian conniving of the characters engaging and at times thought-provoking. We see the power of nobles over their serfs, the power of the King over his nobles, the power of the Church over the people and the power of men over women, all explored through a truly captivating plot. The novel is peopled with characters some of whom we despise and others whom we feel total empathy with. Some of the characters accept the status quo of medieval life and others buck the system from start to finish. Unavoidably, in a story powered by this kind of intrigue, the complications in the plot are occasionally solved in a way that is somewhat contrived. The strength of this novel is that the solutions are always remarkably creative and the author never cheats by introducing unrealistic or previously unknown elements into the story. More than this, however, the solutions are always totally believable given the natures of the compelling characters Follett has created. A great read.
B000I0QL82|1.0|I've lived long and seen more than my fair share of schmaltz and cornball, but the opening song and dance number in this film takes the cake. Crosby's lame jazz warblings and Astaire's embarrassingly dated footwork are enough to give you an undesired and unexpected second look at whatever meal you last ate. Absolutely dreadful. I find it impossible to imagine a crowd of intelligent people sitting in a theater and finding this film entertaining or enjoyable. Say what you will about the state of movie making today, but schlock like this makes you realize just how far the art form has evolved. If released today this abomination would rightly be hooted out of theaters.
038572179X|5.0|You may want to read it more than once; and it will be a pleasure each time. With complex characters, historical detail and a thought provoking ending, I think this is McEwan's best.       Bright, upper-class and a writer at 13, Briony Tallis misunderstands the relationship between her sister Cee and Robbie, the cook's son. Her misunderstandings lead to accusations of a terrible crime and to a tragedy of errors that affect the lives of all three.       In addition to provoking thought about the events in the book, you'll think about what it means to be a writer.  Is a fiction writer obligated to be honest within the world he or she creates?  Is there an obligation to be truthful no matter what? Does a writer's work help justify the events that shape the writer's life?       I read reviews that say the book starts slowly. Don't be discouraged. McEwan's writing is worth the reading. Also, the descriptions of the characters, their relationships and the time in which they live are crucial to the plot.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|If you loved \\"Friends\\", you'll want this limited edition boxed set!  It has every episode, including bloopers, outtakes and extended footage.  All in a beautifully etched wooden case with the cast laminated on a  hinged plexiglass front cover.  Worth every penny!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Got it in Blu-Ray absolutely outstanding... All 11 hours is something to behold.  just wonderful...
B0004Z33G4|4.0|Rambo it's just a classic among the action movies. I bought this box to complete my collection of action movies. There are so many movies probably better than this but I considered it a classic so i got it. It's entertaining and it's packaged with a lot of action
0812975219|3.0|After reading this book I can say that both sets of arguments (the very highly rated and the one stars) are correct. Taleb makes a valid point about randomness in markets and correctly asserts (I think) that what amounts to day trading is just a sexier version of gambling. However, the book is written in a smug tone that saturates the text. The entire book can be summed up by saying,     \\"I believe everything is random and if you disagree you're a moron and I won't listen anyway because I know I'm right, neener neener neener\\".    If you're reading this on a plane or just need a book to kill time and flip through a few funny stories while you get some topical insight on randomness, this book is decent enough. Serious students should read a statistics book or something by a vetted professional. Three stars.
B000VLE3IS|3.0|This is an awsome compilation of Zeppelin tunes if you are new to the band.      However the thing that pissed me off about this disc is the DVD portion is all from How the West Was Won which bummed me out since no where on the disc does it say that.  So consider yourself warned.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Not only are all the songs from the movie on this cd, but they're also the full songs. A must have!
B00064X3FO|5.0|My primary reason for this purchase was the SACD audio track, hence this reiview pertains to that alone....the music clearly stands on its own as some of the very best from a great artist.  There is really no comparison in the quality of sound between this SACD and the CD version, which sounds hollow and tinny in contrast.  The SACD has a much fuller, \\"rounder\\" sound that will be reminiscent of the original master recording some of us remember on vinyl.  Such a shame that not all fine music is available on SACD (or DVD-Audio, which in this reviewer's opinion runs a close second).  While not all recordings on SACD are necessarily created equally, this one is sure to please for the audiophiles out there!
B000005H63|5.0|\\"Michel Plays Petrucciani\\" is a magical album. It seems all the musicians for this album were in the right place at the right time and really made a connection with each other. Not only are the pieces, which are all Petrucciani's, fantastic, but the interplay and high improvisational ability of all these musicians makes this album truly something special.<br /><br />I was also surprised that John Abercrombie played on two songs. He's such a great player and he never sounded better than he does here. Although, Abercrombie is just on two songs, he turns in some of his finest playing on session. The other musicians are all just amazing and are big names in the world of jazz: Roy Haynes on drums, Gary Peacock or Eddie Gomez on bass, and of course John Abercrombie.<br /><br />Petrucciani is incredible on piano as usual. He was a musician of such fine taste and class. He had such a beautiful lyricism to his playing. The most wonderful thing about Michel besides his musical gift is the fact that he overcame his disease all for his passion for jazz music. In spite of his condition, he become a jazz legend.<br /><br />I recommend this album for fans of piano jazz, but also for Petrucciani fans. I would also check out his other work on Blue Note Records, Owl Records, and Dreyfus Records. All his albums are worth acquiring.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This review pertains to the DVD-Audio soundtrack, although it might also be useful to readers to point out that above all, this album is a wonderfully entertaining piece of work particularly and especially to those who are very familiar with the music of the Beatles.  The mixing is very creative and imaginative, inspired no doubt by similar qualities of the original compositions.  What is even more noteworthy is the fabulous clarity of voices and instruments in comparison to the CD format.  I was able to hear sounds never before revealed making it a delight from beginning to end.  The highs are transparent, crisp but not overdone, while the lows seemingly transcend the audible range and wind up somewhere between your subflooring and celiac plexus as they ideally should!  Just a very pleasant journey through \\"Beatle Land,\\" and done so with a nod towards those who appreciate brilliant sound quality.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|I've never been a fan of the Die Hard series, but after a ton of praise from my friends I decided to pick up a Blu-ray copy. The visual/audio quality is amazing, and the flick effortlessly bounces between subtle humor and heart-stopping action.    My Blu-ray collection's getting pretty big, and almost outclasses the PS3 games on my shelf right now.
0760750920|1.0|My negative review is based on one major fact.  There is no where in the description that the book is 6 1/4 x 4 inches in size with only one illustration.  Thus it was not at all appropriate for the three little girls ages 8-10 who were to receive it this Christmas.
B000FJGWBM|5.0|Since this was transfered over from the days before HD mastering existed, the visual quality isn't that much better than DVD. But the audio quality does get a noticeable boost, and the film itself is spectacular. The director The Prestige and Batman Begins knows exactly how much information an audience can retain, and structures the film in reverse, slightly overlapping flashbacks.    It's really cool, and the ending (or beginning I should say) really caught me off guard.
B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|I haven't tried to find the live recording yet but the video is great.  The second half of it is as good as anything Adam Jones has done.  Its all CGI, just so you know, but it doesn't give up any integrity because of it.  But it does have a different feel.  If your buying it just for a new TOOL video and experience its well worth it.  Ground breaking stuff
0156027321|5.0|This is a great book with absolutely beautiful writing and imagery. I couldn't put this book down it was so enthralling. Pi delights the reader before he becomes a castaway and then becomes a survivor of amazing emotional strength and compassion. Can anyone forget a tiger named Richard Parker? This book will stick with me forever.
B00004SC3M|5.0|I have seen this film several times and never tire of it. Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones have great chemistry, which develops while she (a seductive insurance investigator) attempts to entrap Connery, a master thief. Instead the two join forces for a hair-raising, multibillion dollar heist at the new millenium.
B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|Once again Mr. Jones and Mr. Grey have created a masterpiece. The dvd is worth the price for the packaging alone. The video is excellent as well. In a day of downloading, we all should support artist who actually give you something interesting to explore in the packaging...
B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|For everyone who doesn't think there's live footage hidden on this DVD, here's how you unlock it:    First, let the introduction menu play all the way through once (it is about 3 minutes long, but will fade out & start over when it's done).  While it is playing the second time through, enter on your DVD remote 0156.  This is the difference in time between the DVD extended version of 'Vicarious' and the recorded version on '10,000 Days.'  Then, go to the extras menu, select the commentary option & on the Mandy & Brandy screen, press left on your remote 21 times.  Once you're done that, eject the disc &, while looking through the hole of the DVD at your TV (your screen should be glossy enough so you can see your reflection), sing the chorus to 'Vicarious' three times.  Afterwards, insert the DVD again, this time UPSIDEDOWN, and a twenty minute live concert video should begin.  If it doesn't, you've obviously done something wrong.  I had particular problems counting to 21 exactly while pressing left, & hitting that B flat during the chorus.  If you work at it long enough, it'll work.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|For $20, I wouldn't have been so disappointed, but at $35, it's a piece of junk. Battery charge lasted for less than five minutes, and it didn't pick up dirt very well. Boo!
B000JRYOPG|5.0|If you like Belly, State Property, Blue Hill Av, Scarface or any of them then YOU GOTTA GET DIS!!!!
B00000D9TQ|4.0|great album as with most greastest hits.  I always enjoy \\"in the air tonight\\" i play that to get psych up before work.
B000W04S6U|5.0|Awesome compilation, the songs are just what you'd expect from Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori - and more. If you're into the Halo trilogy, buy this soundtrack!
B000N4S8RA|5.0|I am a sort of a new fan of Biffy Clyro, I first heard of them when they were opening up for Queens of the Stone Age. I figured with a name like that and the fact that Queens has them opening for them, they have to be at least different. I like music that is different but yet is hard hitting and melodic. That is exactly what they are.    Their fourth effort since the mid 90's I feel that \\"Puzzle\\" is their most grown up and realized album. The experimentation is still there and the hard hitting tracks are there as well. Although it is not as heavey as previous albums there is almost, if not any, screaming at all. The melodies and the instrumentation make up for it. After listening to it a few times I think that this is definitley of my favorite albums of all time.     An orginal and very talented band I would recommend \\"Puzzle\\" or any one of their three other albums to anyone.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Although we own all the music already from Zepplin, I still had to have this one.. Love the DVD!
B000PFU7OO|4.0|This CD is so fantastic as the movie. It's the typical little treasure that you find from time to time.
B000WC3AGM|5.0|What a cute product! I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter and the locker is very cute. It is extremely sturdy and just the right size for sitting on a desk. Of course, what's not to love about the DVD. And, the totebag is a really good size and well made.
B000Z0OX9O|3.0|When it was first announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2007 that a new \\"extended\\" 3-disc soundtrack of Vangelis' Blade Runner score would be released by the end of the year to coincide with the release of Ridley Scott's \\"Final Cut\\" [[ASIN:B000K15VSA Blade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition)]], fans rejoiced with the assumption that the complete film score was finally getting an \\"official\\" release after numerous releases and bootlegs of varying lengths and sub-standard quality. Unfortunately if you are looking for the complete film score, this is not the CD you're looking for.<br /><br />Disc 1 is a re-mastering of the 1994 Vangelis album (although it sounds identical to my original CD) which featured music from the film edited together with numerous dialog samples from the film as well as newly composed music by Vangelis that did not appear anywhere in the film.  As an album, it was interesting thematically in its own right with some beautifully composed themes like \\"Rachel's Song\\" and \\"Damask Rose\\" but it was still not the original film soundtrack and was considered to be a disappointment.<br /><br />Disc 2 features officially unreleased cues, some of which are not even heard anywhere in the film.  Some are outtakes from the workprint but most of the memorable cues from the film are completely omitted such as the opening \\"Prologue\\" with the somber haunting Asian motif that establishes the dark tone and atmosphere of the film as well as the Egyptian Taffey Lewis club ambiance and the cues from when Deckard enters the Bradbury are not included.<br /><br />Disc 3 is a collection of letters and \\"spoken word\\" commentaries from various authors, actors and film makers who share their memories and experiences of the celebrated cult classic along with newly composed music by Vangelis, again \\"inspired by\\" the film but not the original, unabridged movie soundtrack.<br /><br />What SHOULD have been a 3-disc officially released motion picture soundtrack that would have nullified the numerous bootlegs that have proliferated the market is not to be had.  Let's examine the different versions available and what's missing from this release:<br /><br />1982 New American Orchestra [[ASIN:B000002KYK Blade Runner: Orchestral Adaptation Of Music Composed For The Motion Picture By Vangelis]] - an orchestral arrangement and jazz rendition of Vangelis' electronic compositions from the film.  Generally regarded as an inferior album and not the original motion picture soundtrack containing barely over a half an hour of material with a scant running time of 33:16 containing the following tracks:<br /><br />1. Love Theme (4:12)<br />2. Main Title (5:01)<br />3. One More Kiss, Dear (4:00)<br />4. Memories Of Green (4:50)<br />5. End Title (4:17)<br />6. Blade Runner Blues (4:38)<br />7. Farewell (3:10)<br />8. End Title Reprise (3:08)<br /><br />1994 Atlantic Vangelis [[ASIN:B000002IZM Blade Runner]] - the first \\"official\\" Vangelis release containing nearly an hour of music with a running time of 57:53, most of which contained newly composed themes and dialog samples from the film mixed into selections of the film's soundtrack cues comprised of the following 12 tracks:<br /><br />1. Main Titles (3:42)<br />2. Blush Response (5:47)<br />3. Wait for Me (5:27)<br />4. Rachel's Song (4:46)<br />5. Love Theme (4:56)<br />6. One More Kiss, Dear (3:58)<br />7.

The complete original soundtrack has become almost as legendary and elusive amongst fans as the various versions and cuts of the film itself.

The complete original soundtrack has become almost as legendary and elusive amongst fans as the various versions and cuts of the film itself.  Perhaps for the 30th, 40th or even 50th anniversary release might be the soundtrack's \\"Final Cut\\" but this 3-disc release is anything but.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Its all here. All the versions and even all the answers to the questions that has pondered fans of this movie.  Is Deckard a Replicant?  If there were 6 Reps that escaped, what happened to the final one?  In his confrontation with Tyrell, does Batty say \\"father\\" or f***er\\"?  This movie is by far the deepest sci fi movie ever made.  Alot of subtext, symbolism and hidden meanings, this is the \\"thinking man's sci fi movie\\" that is more than a pretty package.  Any fan will love having it!
B000FA57N0|5.0|After a short-lived (15-episode) sci-fi TV series named \\"Firefly\\" that aired between 2002 and 2003 was canceled, a large cult following had developed.  Series producer/creator Joss Whedon (who created & produced the 1997-2003 TV series \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", as well as the 1999-2004 TV series \\"Angel\\") was able to direct and write the 2005 film \\"Serenity\\" based upon the \\"Firefly\\" TV series and let the cast of the TV series reprise their roles in the film.  Taking place some 500 years in the future, a former galactic war veteran named Captain Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) is the captain of a transport ship named \\"Serenity\\".  His hired crew includes Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres), pilot Hoban 'Wash' Washburne (Alan Tudyk), former soldier Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) and engineer Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite).  With mankind having ravished the Earth, humans have colonized other planets and satellites, which are under the control of a totalitarian government called the Alliance.  Simon Tam (Sean Maher) helps to rescue his sister River (Summer Glau) from the Alliance, which has experimented on her brain, giving her strong telepathic powers.  Taking refuge aboard Serenity, Mal and his crew protect Simon & River, but also discover some horrible secrets about Alliance activities & cover-ups while a highly trained Alliance assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) hunts them down.    With superb special effects, great cinematography, a gripping plot and very engaging characters, \\"Serenity\\" was a superb piece of science fiction and higly deserving of a 5 out of 5 star rating. Sadly, while the film received much attention & awards from various science fiction academies, it received no attention from the Academy Awards.  Other notable characters from the film include Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz) and Inara (Morena Baccarin).  Whether or not you were a fan of the short-lived \\"Firefly\\" TV series, but enjoy good science fiction, you should consider viewing \\"Serenity\\", which I highly recommend.
1559409002|3.0|The film seemed strangely lacking in it's plot development, although the acting was credible for the style the film was attempting to emulate.  Once I saw the extras, and how the director and crew of this film were best known for hundreds of \\"Centron\\" public service films in the 60's (another genre that was spoofed by the animated Simpsons \\"Troy McClure\\"), it frankly cast a negative light on this film-as if this film was merely their triumphant apogee of a rather drab, cheap genre.  I want to emphasize, the film essentially has no story whatsoever, and the general direction of the story is pretty obvious, from the get go.  What drives the film are the one off set pieces on cold human cruelty and isolation, and utter hypocrisy.  The male boarder was outstanding, as was the phony land lady-examples of character types that we all know.    The movie is weak-but it is atmospheric, with some strong jabs at people's miserable existence-whether they be dead, or essentially dead.  As such, the satirical points of the film, about human coldness and isolation, ring true to this day.  The overall point of the film is not that well stated, not even in subtle terms, and there is truly no real protagonist in the film.  Even our heroine is an unknown quantity, other than that she was a passenger in the car, not the instigator ( a Centron jab at being careful who you get into a car with? I don't know!)    I felt conned after watching this, as if I had watched a super long public service film about knowing who to trust, and knowing when to die, as all souls apparently need to know!
B000L4JQCI|4.0|I love this snorkel. I personally are not a huge fan of exercising, but I do enjoy swimming, and decided to use swimming as my exercise program. At first, I got very tired after very few laps, but after starting to use the freestyle snorkel, I can swim much more without getting tired or having to stop every few laps. The difference was incredible for me. I went from swimming about 700m to about 2000 in a matter of days. I enjoy the fact that I can breathe when I want/need, independantly of at what stage of the stroke I am. Since I swim for the exercise, and not competitively, this is a great product. I give only 4 stars, because after 2 months of use, one of the pieces that get in your mouth for you to bite (it has 2, not sure how to call them) came off, probably due to me biting to hard on it, could still be used quite comfortably with only one of these, but still went ahead and bought another.     This product has made swimming an enjoyable exercise. I love it and would recommend it to anybody.
B000J103WK|5.0|I love all the songs - the performances and even the interviews and backstage stuff. What is not to like - this is a much older, more sober and perhaps, even wiser Eagles! Great music that never grows old - unlike the group members who seem to be slightly aged and beat up from life and drugs - but one still has to love them for what they make together as a band. This is signature Eagles stuff. You can watch and listen to this over and over - one does not tire of it.<br /><br />What a great selection of songs:<br /> The Long Run, New Kids In Town, Wasted Time. Peaceful Easy Feeling, I Can't Tell You Why, One Of These Nights, One Day At A Time, Lyin' Eyes, The Boys Of Summer, In The City, Already Gone, Silent Spring, Tequila Sunrise, Love Will Keep Us Alive, No More Cloudy Days, Hole In The World, Take It To The Limit, You Belong To The City, Walk Away, Sunset Grill, Life's Been Good, Dirty Laundry,Funk #49, Heartache Tonight, Life In The Fast Lane, Hotel California, Rocky Mountain Way, All She Wants To Do Is Dance, Take It Easy, Desperado!
B000V86OKG|5.0|My favorite, all time, TV series has been The West Wing hands down. Well finally there is something to compete with it. Dexter is one of THE BEST SHOWS EVER! Season Two is even better than Season One. Without giving anything away, this season has one of the BEST endings in TV History! Great acting! Great Writing! Great Camera work! GET THIS SEASON!
B0001US8FI|2.0|Enter the Dragon is considered by many to be the greatest martial arts film ever. That's not true. ETD isn't even Bruce Lee's greatest film (Fist of Fury, AKA \\"The Chinese Connection\\" is.) There were and are a hundreds of martial arts films way better than this movie. Check out any of the old classic Shaw Brothers movies. Or check out Jackie Chan's filmography and rent some of his movies. But, here's Hollywood again trying to glamourize and sugar-coat the Asian chop-socky market. The plot to this movie is so typical, but alot of martial art films have basic plots, but this movie was just boring. The only thing that brought excitement to this movie was Bruce Lee. Bruce's charisma and film persona leaped through the movie screen. He could make a home movie and make it a classic (Oh! He did do that!) Bruce seemed disinterested in the scenes where he wasn't fighting. Although the film has a good cast of actors, the script was so horrible that they couldn't save this film. The only reason this movie is a cult classic is because Bruce's fight choregraphy in this film was probably his best. But, even some the fight sequences were a total letdown. Come on, who wanted to see John Saxon take on Bolo at the end of the movie?! Everyone wanted to see Bruce mix-it-up with the \\"Chinese Hercules\\"! But, that's Hollywood.
B000GH9FY4|5.0|There are products that are designed to wow us with their seemingly infinite scope of features and permutations; at the opposite extreme there are products that sacrifice functionality in order to be aesthetically pleasing.  The Behringer Xenyx 802 falls into neither of these categories.  It's not fancy, but it has a specific use and it just does it well.    There are several different routing options, including separate outputs for headphone monitoring, control room output, and line out.  In addition, this little mixer provides phantom power to up to two microphones.  The sound quality is very transparent, and you have to really jack up the gain to hear any background noise.  Overall, this device creates the clean, even frequency response of solid state electronics but without the cold, brittle digitalian cast that plagues direct digital recording.  I use this for recording on my computer via my [[ASIN:B000J1F1BI Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Sound Card ( 70SB073A00000 )]]; I have a somewhat rare cable which converts stereo 1/4\\" to stereo RCA, from which point I use a Y-cable to convert to a miniplug (yes, I can hear you audiophiles groaning).  Using this setup, with some simple level adjustment on the 802, I can record both my keyboard and my voice (via the [[ASIN:B0007W1NH0 AKG Perception 200 Condenser Microphone]]) with high fidelity.  I use this setup for producing demo recordings, but other possible uses include podcasting and pulling mixer duty for a live performance in a small venue.    The on board controls are nothing special, really.  The EQ would probably be useful in a pinch, but I generally gravitate toward software-based EQ and effects in lieu of hardware equivalents, if only because I have much more control when using software.  I imagine dedicated hardware would probably sound much better, though.  Honestly, the 802 doesn't require a degree in rocket surgery to use; an instinctive knowledge of I/O and a basic understanding of audio equipment are the (loose) prerequisites.  And, if you have trouble, the manual is very informative.  What's more, it takes high honors as the absolute best English translation of a manual that I have ever come across.    As far as build quality, when testing out the controls I found that the knobs felt very solid without being sticky.  Unfortunately, my unit does not sit flush on the table; I am not sure if this happens often with this model or brand.  Other than this, the 802 seems very well made and I get the impression that it could get kicked around my home studio a lot and still keep on working.  Reviews at various online music equipment retailers confirm the above.    My sole complaint about the 802 is that it has a somewhat unconventional metering display: While most audio meters will use a row of yellow LEDs to indicate when a signal is coming close to 0.0 dB (without clipping), on the 802 the yellow LEDs light up when a signal has actually exceeded 0.0 dB and is thus already mildly distorted.  This is fine on a tube amp, I suppose, but for a solid state device one would probably not want any distortion, and the color coding of the meter is a little strange given that standpoint.  I am more concerned when glancing over at the mixer if I am coming close to 0 dB, and a row of yellow LEDs in the -6 dB through 0 dB range would have been a lot more useful to me.    Still, the above is a very minor issue, and overall this is a wonderful little piece of equipment.  Does it come packed with ten million different capabilities and features?  No, of course not.  But it doesn't follow the annoying modern trend of hiding everything behind a blank exterior with three or so tiny buttons shoved off to the side and out of sight, either (are you reading this Apple and all those like you?).  For basic mixing work, small-scale demo recording, podcasting, and intimate live performances, the Behringer Xenyx 802 would be a very useful addition to anyone's equipment arsenal.  There's something comforting about analog knobs, something musical in exactly the way that clicking through a series of computer generated dialogs or editing patch parameters with a menu substructure and a pair of up and down buttons just isn't.  The tactile sensation inspires a sort of creative mindset, if you will.  Call me crazy if you like, but even if analog didn't sound better than digital (please don't get into that debate with me; if you disagree than so be it) I would probably still surround myself with analog equipment.    My recommendation is if you need something unglamorous but very capable of accomplishing its intended use, then the Behringer Xenyx 802 is definitely something you should consider.  It's relatively cheap, it's high quality, and it's an overall good beginning investment.
B0000024IE|5.0|I'm not even a fan of Rap, and this is definitely in my top 10 records ever. What makes it great ? Everything. I learned more in 12 PE songs than in twelve years of public school. Have been a music listener for 25 tears, and I can truly say this is a masterpiece. Chuck D had the establishment worried. And for good reason. This is anti-racist, anti-stupidity musicmaking with the problems of our culture square in hand. All in a format which proclaims turntable spinner Terminator X as a certified musician, despite the inferior efforts of his contemporaries. This is an essential disc.

0321344758|3.0|This is an expensive book (list price) for something less than 200 pages. Nonetheless the advice within it is worth every penny. I won't repeat what other reviewers have to say about the content. But please note that my copy fell apart before I'd finished the first read.  The binding is awful. The pages fell out in ever increasing chunks until all I now have left is the cover and a bunch of sections that I have to keep stuffing back when I put the book away.  And, it's a book that I refer to frequently.
0060558121|4.0|This is one of those books that people either really hate or really love. Myself, I enjoyed it. Some reviews on Amazon.com reveal how some readers thought it was hard to get through--somewhat slow. I can understand why people would think that, but I found myself trying to interpret what Gaiman is trying to say. Much symbolism abounds in \\"American Gods.\\" Not a quick read, but for me, it was worth it.
0143038583|5.0|This book is about the best I've read on the complex issues of the source, quality and ethics of our foods in America. A must read for anyone who cares about what is entering his or her body.
1594489505|5.0|Incredible story about women enduring the personal and political struggles of living in Afghanistan. I believe I liked this even better than Hosseini's The Kite Runner, and that's a difficult feat! Another benefit of reading this book: the history of Afghanistan is explained from the viewpoint of the characters. One caveat: this story contains some intense scenes. Highly recommended.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|An amazing movie... both got sent to the wrong address, but with no problem at all it was fixed in time for Christmas!
B000J103PC|5.0|This is on Cable all the time but it was a great gift to give.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I've been waiting for this ever since I first heard it.  It's so great that they were able to keep this awesome story going.  This is going to be an awesome movie.    Now I'm excited to see when the 2nd movie is coming.  Every SG-1 and Atlantis fan has to remember that Robert Cooper is trying to get a second spin-off going, Stargate: Universe!  We have to show our support to keep it going!
B000HA4WT8|2.0|Not worth the purchase. I dont think the acting is that good and it comes out on cable tv once a week!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Here is a show that under the title of Gilmorisms, delivers the funniest and wittiest pop culture references ever in a TV show.  Fans of the in-joke are also catered for and believe me, you have to be quick and pay attention or you may miss something. Obviously, a pack like this is for fans of the show but if you haven't become a Gilmorian, I suggest you catch an episode or two  on whatever cable network is currently showing it in syndication and then treat yourself to whole seasons.........I did.
1594489505|5.0|Great novel. Really helped me understand a little more about the recent history of Afghanistan, including the part Americans have played in it. Also made the lives of the women in the novel, and the women of Afghanistan in general, much more personal. Highly reccomended.
0151013837|5.0|A fantastic story, and now with the illustrations, it becomes even more of an adventure.  I wish I had bought one for myself!
B000YMBBH0|1.0|Mine came through as defective. The final had a problem and would not play the last scene. I did order the HD edition.    Bummer Amazon has promised me a replacement but dang it to get to the end and not know what happened. Give me a break :)    Now have to hope Amazon stands behind it and does send me a return lable and also replaces the product.
1594489505|5.0|Surprisingly even better than Kite Runner, this novel reveals in great detail how brutally women can be treated in Muslim society, and how powerless they are to affect change.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I loved the show when it was on the air and was happy to be able to see the series again.  I watched it straight through.
B000002NAK|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Modonna, but she is the living musical incarnation of Eva Peron in the film and soundtrack. Her range isn't quite up to the task, but somehow it only enhances the overall effect. You really believe she believes she's helping Argentina with her antics. Brilliant. Antonio Banderas is wonderful as Che, his accent is thick, but again, I really feel it enhances the overall believablity of his performance. The music itself is of course absolute genius. I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone who enjoys contemporary musicals.
B000057NVH|5.0|If you enjoy multi-channel recordings this one is a must have.Although it's actually a quad(4 channel recording) taken from the original quad master,the sound is truly amazing. Tubular Bells has never sounded better and I had the original quad LP. Even if you don't have a multi-channel setup you can still enjoy in spectacular stereo. A truly remarkable cd!
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|*** 2007. Adapted from Stephen Hunter's [[ASIN:0553563513 Point of Impact]], SHOOTER was directed by Antoine Fuqua. Mark Wahlberg is deceived, shot at, wounded and chased throughout the United States. Mark Wahlberg recovers, shoots at, chases away and kills those who deceived him. A classic plot for a solid thriller.
0307237702|5.0|I did not expect this second book by Barack Obama to be as good as his first. In someways it was not, but in other ways it was better. Senator Obama, in my opinion, is a very good writer and could make a career of it if he ever gets tired of trying to save the world. In the meantime his anaysis of the world as it is, and as it could be does indeed give us something to hope for. His frank admission of his own problems as a young husband and father shows that he is a realist and not afraid to share. His analysis of the world situation, from the US, to Indonesia, to Africa, to Iraq shows a much deeper understanding than would be evident from the debates. America needs to read this book.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|Easily the best in the series the whole team really figured it out this time out.  Let's all remember the original Oceans (11), with the Rat Pack, wasn't academy award material (thankfully).  This is a movie that's more about the fun than anything else. The cast works well together.  The script actually, eventually, makes sense.  And the swinging Vegas atmosphere is awesome.<br /><br />Great flick!!
B000OCZD5G|5.0|Man o Man. I guess its not important to comment on the actual significance of the story, characters, locations, and stunts as everyone already knows how sweet this film is. I will make a quick comment however on the transfer of the Road Warrior.     I couldn't believe my eyes. If you have a HDTV you will be visually stunned. It looks like it was shot yesterday in HD format. Seriously though, this is a prime example of what blu ray can do for older films if the proper care and attention is taken during the digital transfer. That said, when i bought this blu ray, I also bought the Patriot shot roughly 20 years later, and it looked like a regular DVD. Good movie, but why didn't it look as sharp as the Road Warrior?    I highly recommend this version of the film to anyone with a taste for quality.
0740748475|5.0|I wanted this since I first heard about it pre-release.  When I saw it in stores I had all I could do to NOT purchase it - the price (like $175) made me cringe.  I finally found it on Amazon for a DECENT price but still couldn't justify the $$.  When it went on sale for one day I snagged it.  (It was on my 'Wish List' but AMAZON didn't notify me... ?!?!?) It's been over a year now since it's initial release but I'm glad I waited for the sale - whatta deal!  C & H is one of the all-time greats and this package does it the complete justice it deserves.  It's huge and weighty - giving the strip the epic feel that, when you look at it from start to finish, it really is.

It is not about jumping around, it is about stretching and using your body for stability and resistance.  I am a dancer and found this book wonderful, I made my husband try it and he was a little confused with the terminology and that he has never put his body in some of the exercise poses before!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is a good DVD version of a great movie.  I understand that it fails to engage many viewers, and I don't want to sound condescending and suggest that the unengaged lack attention spans.  Certain art pleases some and displeases others and this film is no different.    \\"Kane\\" combines humor and pathos in a tale of lost innocence, arrogance and self-destruction (plus numerous other themes) that will either speak to you or annoy you by the end.  It spoke to me.  I loved the symobolism and allegory, and I, personally, love the history that goes along with the film of the epic battle between Welles and Hearst.    In terms of the history of American Cinema, you cannot dismiss this film.  If you're serious about understanding the growth of the American film industry, the evoloution of the film maker's craft, and viewing milestone works of American film then you have to have \\"Citizen Kane\\" on your list.  That doesn't mean you have to like it.
0060989157|4.0|I bought this book for my book club.  Another lady had chosen it for her book pick.  I was less than thrilled, I was not happy about having to purchase something I would never usually read.  I did buy it and I read it and have to say that it was well written, heartfelt at times, and interesting.  On the other hand it was blatantly graffic, obnoxiously big-headed, and annoying.   I QUITE ENJOYED IT!!!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|It's a shame she has had such bad publicity because this is an awesome cd.  I was really blown away how good the cd really was.  I wish the girl the best and hope people will put aside her personal problems and just let the music speak for itself.  She's getting the short end of the stick because this cd is the best yet from her!
0060977493|5.0|Great Book, I am not going to retell the story or any part of it you wil just have to buy it for yourself to find out, but what a read, I loved it.  It was very well written and easy to read, which made it better to follow along.
B000065VB0|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Generally speaking, its notorious that the most intriguing fase in Peter Gabriel's music is the one kept in his first four albums, until So, which leads into a more commercial fase. Peter Gabriel 3: Melt, is undoubtly the artist's most experimental, dark, complex and implicit in its content, a masterpiece throughout a music tendency, and his definitively best of all times. While his previous two entered into a more accessible aspect of experimental/progressive rock music, this album keeps a complete dark atmosphere, regarding a side in art rock music that would become firm and solid, I even agree with other reviewers who think that this was also inside just before the new wave explosion; a \\"delightful madness\\" in its songs, a versatility but cohersion in its context, and still fine and accessible experiments in his music; that's what makes it his best, swinging from the dark brutality of the hipnotic \\"Intruder\\" (with Phil Collins on drums), the blasting instrumentation and mastership in the perforing \\"No Self-Control\\", the rebelling \\"I Don't Remember\\", the heartful and serious, dramatic atmosphere of \\"Family Snapshot\\", the mixed style which penetrated perfectly into popular streams of (my personal favourite) \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" to the humanitarian, world music-inflicted \\"Biko\\", this release proofs to be comprehensible into popular mainstream and professional, serious ambits in an exact way, with the same impact. Peter Gabriel's vocals and compositions at his best, with Kate Bush in some backing vocals and the chapman stick of Tony Levin; inmaculate performance, being as experimental as possible but yet very familiar and not slick.<br /><br />The remastered version has a great sound quality, but not perfect, some new pictures in the intern artwork, no bonus tracks.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I loved this film when I saw it at the movies in 1982. It only got better with the small adjustments, losing the voiceover and all that. I was surprised to find the US had never seen the version the UK got. When I bought my first VHS machine in 1987 this was my first tape, when I got my first DVD player in 1999 this was my first DVD. It will probably be my first HD-DVD, when they end the format wars.    But here we have the final cut. Some of the dialog has been adjusted, it's subtle and I'm far from convinced it was necessary and don't always agree with the change, but that's fine. The movie finally scans right for the US audience, it makes sense the way Ridley Scott always intended it to. So it is the definitive version and I expect to watch it often.    But the thing that makes it worth every single cent is the director's commentary by Ridley Scott. This is an outstanding and wonderfully informative commentary. He goes in to the background of details, Rutger Hauer penned the final version of Roy's last words, Harrison Ford came up with the blood in the glass and catching the bottle as he sat up. Loads more. But there's also details on the methods used to achieve the lighting effects, like how the owl's eyes light up and why he used it on Sean Young later. He even explains why some people thing Deckard is a replicant.    Excellent. Christmas came early for me.
B000002KHH|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Black Sabbath's Paranoid even becomes a classic just by listening to it; it contains such recognizable rock basis in a variety of styles that comes surprisingly succesful, and I like to recognize it because it became smashingly famous despite poor radio airplay or popular commentary. Black Sabbath displays a realism in the moods of this album that comes really delightful and emotional, still 1970 was caught into psychedelia and hippies, and the music here displays a lot of this material but in such an extraordinarily original way, notorious in the album's emotions, swinging from close to sci-fi, doom, gloomy themes, political angriness, and popular themes to wich the people could connect with in the era, drugs, psychedelia, experience and rebellion. Much here, the music is just as wide as expanding, possessing a heavy blues rock in its style, but also making revolutions in psychedelic rock, hard rock, and a wider heavy metal basis than the one Iron Butterfly displayed earlier, coming with most memorable rythms and riffs that can be noticed today in rock music, the only thing is, while it is an unignorable basis in rock, the music comes less elaborate than many things done even by the period, Ozzy's vocals are simple in its manner, and, while not hitting into experimental territories, it can get common or fatidical.<br /><br />\\"War Pigs\\" gets smashing, memorable and politically charged but less impressive, which refers to politicians as \\"pigs\\" just as Roger Waters of Pink Floyd has refered onto politicians (any connections?), \\"Paranoid\\" became a hughe success, reaching into a more angst-ridden style and unusually faster, wich is an aspect that would perdure into heavy metal; particulary this song is one of the songs which deserves great critical acclaim. \\"Planet Caravan\\" is the most psychedelic in the album, but its widely elaborate and more complex, \\"Iron Man\\" has one of the most recognizable guitar riffs in history, plus an story-like mood with a unique hard rock touch, this song is just legendary. \\"Electric Funeral\\" is more like a mix of many different styles, while \\"Hand Of Doom\\" may be the most elaborate song in the album, one of my favourites, starting of bluesy and later going much harder. \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" is another top pick, its generally shorter and acquireable, but the song's sense of humor is just impressive. General, there are far more elaborate pieces in rock, even by the time, but Black Sabbath generated a total inspiration and originality in this album, being their most famous and acclaimed, and, while I haven't listened to their later career, the album is a principal jewel in all aspects of rock music.hard rock touch, this song is just legendary. \\"Electric Funeral\\" is more like a mix of many different styles, while \\"Hand Of Doom\\" may be the most elaborate song in the album, one of my favourites, starting of bluesy and later going much harder. \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" is another top pick, its generally shorter and acquireable, but the song's sense of humor is just impressive.
