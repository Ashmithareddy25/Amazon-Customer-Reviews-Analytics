0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead is one of Orson Scott Card's best works, but despite the fact that it is a sequel-of-sorts to Ender's Game, its style, themes and tone holds little in common with that book. It is a brilliant story that focuses on concepts of the other and one's relationship to that.<br /><br />Set 3,000 years after Ender's Game, but only twenty-too-thirty years for Ender, the young protagonist of the first book is now a lonely thirty-something year old man haunted by the crimes he feels he has committed. No longer a soldier, nor even a governor, Ender is now a humanist priest who tells the life stories of the dead.<br /><br />To that end, this is a book about self-and-other. An existentialist examination of human, and non-human relations. To that end, it is a brilliant and emotional story well worth reading.<br /><br />For a full review go to [...] or short link straight to the article at: [...]

0399236058|5.0|I bought the board book format and my 20 month old grand-daughter (who has many, many Eric Carle books) has added it to her library.  Eric Carle does it again - naming the days of the week and food items - Monday-string beans, Tuesday-spaghetti, Wednesday -zoop, etc.  Right after hearing Wednesday, she'd say &#34;zoop&#34;, giggle and chuckle.  I was overjoyed!  On my last visit, we read that book 10 times!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|A little more accessible.  Can't figure out what's going on, sometimes.  Love the graphics.  Please consider keepng &#34;hints&#34; onscreen a few seconds longer.  They disappear too quickly.

140006922X|1.0|We need to have the anti-Christian media just take a breath and try to look at this book objectively.  If you are considering buying this book please consider the following:<br /><br />\\"Zealot, is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years. Its conclusions are long-held Islamic claims--namely, that Jesus was a zealous prophet type who didn't claim to be God, that Christians have misunderstood him, and that the Christian Gospels are not the actual words or life of Jesus but \\"myth.\\"<br />Media reports have introduced the author Reza Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim.  Aslan is not a trained historian. His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio. \\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus--from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.<br />Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark--because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.\\"  John S Dickerson
B001BKVWYG|5.0|He was born in 1942 in a Mexican-American family in Detroit. Always absorbed in music and poetry, Sixto Rodriguez found himself playing every type of gig in the Motor City until commingle involved with musician/producer/songwriter Dennis Coffey and signing to Sussex label where he created this album which turned out to be an enormous underground musical success story...in South Africa that is. While critically acclaimed this album did nothing stateside,their were fantastical rumors about Rodriguez's supposed suicide until this elusive human being was discovered alive and well again in the late 90's. For more,best to refer to the excellent documentary [[ASIN:B008JFUTT0 Searching for Sugar Man]]. For me personally it was this album that peaked my curiosity first. A man who always wore sunglasses and seemed nearly invisible. Who was he? Why was this album the \\"psyche-folk masterpiece\\" it was promoted as from the sticker on the cover? True seeing the documentary helped some. But sometimes the ears have it. I've heard this now and absorbed it. And this is what my own ears heard.<br /><br />  \\"Sugar Man\\",perhaps the song most closely associated with Rodriguez is a melodically moody and beautifully orchestrated bluesy folk/soul with lyrics poetically illustrating the escape (and trap) drug use offers to some over the realities of American inner city life for the working poor. On the ferocious psychedelic rocker \\"Only Good For Conversation\\", a lady is berated for her self absorption-perhaps: the lyrics have much ambiguity about them which makes them very appealing. On the equally beautifully arranged \\"Crucify Your Mind\\" and the hard grooving,bluesy funkiness of \\"The Establishment Blues\\",\\"Hate Street Dialog\\",\\"Rich Folks Hoax\\",\\"James S Piddy\\",Inner City Blues\\" before Marvin Gaye even had that in his own song of the same title as well as \\"Gommorah (A Nursery Rhyme)\\" Rodriguez showcases his observations of the callousness of those who allow themselves to become essentially corporate prostitutes and indulge themselves in endless exploitation of...well people just like him and those he knew all his life I imagine.  \\"Forget It\\" and \\"Like Janis\\" are both amazing folk/rock compositions-inspired some by Bob Dylan's poetically romantic numbers of the era yet far more plain spoken in orientation.<br /><br />  With it's prominent opening bass line,shuffling Motown-like rhythm and very catchy hook \\"I Wonder\\" comes off as an obvious attempt at a hit. And a very good one too. Would love to have been hearing this on compilation albums growing up myself: thoughtful pop soul all the way. So sure this album had a cult following and inspired an anti apartheid social revolution in South Africa. That is wonderful and touching. Yet what makes this album so compelling is in it's musicality. So many people have sought to be mouthpieces for the working class minorities of America. Rodriquez was the real deal in every respect,and still is. With the help of Coffey he was instrumentally able to mix acoustic based folk rock,blues and psychedelic soul with a touch of Hispanic folk into a potent brew of humanistic lyricism that speaks directly to the listener. This is truly music for the people. And it reaches them with very few of the cliches most such music goes by-even the romantic type numbers. Also he doesn't pander to the \\"grimness is beautiful\\" ethic either. While he is truthful about the sociopolitical truths around him,there is always a melody and/or lyrics that are beautiful and positive. He offers a good balance of social outrage and romantic passion. Therefore, I can see his appeal very easily and why-even if he only ever made this one album why it deserved the recognition it finally received.orate prostitutes and indulge themselves in endless exploitation of...well people just like him and those he knew all his life I imagine.  \\"Forget It\\" and \\"Like Janis\\" are both amazing folk/rock compositions-inspired some by Bob Dylan's poetically romantic numbers of the era yet far more plain spoken in orientation.<br /><br />  With it's prominent opening bass line,shuffling Motown-like rhythm and very catchy hook \\"I Wonder\\" comes off as an obvious attempt at a hit.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez was probably a bit disappointed his powerfully strong debut [[ASIN:B001BKVWYG Cold Fact]] didn't equal its acclaim in commerce. But as the man himself even said,that is the music business. But he was also a survivor. He decided to decamp to Europe,settling for a time in London to make this second album. Perhaps if America was closed minded to what Rodriguez had to offer, the always expanding UK/European pop music scene might embrace him-and therefore America through the reverse filer: similar to Chess blues artists. It was basically what Rodriguez would view as his closest attempt anyway at a pop album. He was very interested in expanding his music outward creatively from his first, but again his primary interest was communicating with the audience his musical and lyrical interests-both of which were very inspired and involving. It was the end of 1971. And something more was about to end too.<br /><br />  \\"Climb Up On My Music\\" was a alternately poetic and literal plea for people to embrace his musical offerings-set to a powerfully rhythmic jazz/rock arrangement with Rodriguez working out with the other musicians on his guitar during the final and more instrumental half-nothing like the music on the debut. \\"A Most Disgusting Song\\",set to a melancholy country/folk type tune tells the stories of the all too similar (and often corruptible) personalities at the many gigs he'd played-all of which consisted of socially opposite personalities ironically. \\"Heikki's Suburbia Bus Tour\\" is a hard grooving funky rocker that describes exploitation as viewed almost from a tourists point of view. \\"I Think You You\\",\\"Silver Words\\" and \\"It Started Out So Nice\\" are romantically inclined numbers that are both charming and reflective-with productions of dew drop level clarity of spirit to boot.<br /><br />  \\"Sandrevan Lullaby-Lifestyles\\",\\"To Whom It May Concern\\" and \\"Halfway Up The Stairs\\" are truly epic numbers in terms of arrangement and lyrical scope illustrating entropy of many kinds: romantically and in America's social structure before urging people to think and take action. \\"Cause\\" is a powerfully building folk type number-highly prophetic to what would happen: Rodriguez got dropped by Sussex \\"two weeks before Christmas\\"-exactly as this song indicates. \\"Can't Get Away\\",\\"Street Boy\\" and \\"I'll Slip Away\\" are all socially pointed and wonderfully crafted folk/soul songs from an unfinished third album. Excellent bonus tracks! After the non event of this album Rodriguez did what most artists in this situation should do: he dusted himself off,returned to Detroit,attended Wayne University,became involved in local inner city building renovation projects and general political activism-even running for public office at one point and raising a family. He sought to improve himself. So even with the happenstance of his later success musically, his life in those wilderness year (unknown as it was) remains a shinning example of a human triumph.many kinds: romantically and in America's social structure before urging people to think and take action. \\"Cause\\" is a powerfully building folk type number-highly prophetic to what would happen: Rodriguez got dropped by Sussex \\"two weeks before Christmas\\"-exactly as this song indicates. \\"Can't Get Away\\",\\"Street Boy\\" and \\"I'll Slip Away\\" are all socially pointed and wonderfully crafted folk/soul songs from an unfinished third album.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love it but would be better if you would get to pick your favorite minion .Other then that I would have gave this a 5 star review.
140006922X|5.0|I just finished reading this book. I have to say it was riveting. If anyone is considering reading this book I highly recommend it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Always enjoyed this movie. Anyone who has never seen this should order it and watch it immediately. Great acting, Great movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app for all my weather needs, accurate and up to date information. Like how you can put your home city in the drop down bar.
B00138F56W|4.0|I've been listening to this score for well over 10 years now and still find it very enjoyable, with Williams back at the top of his game with the big LSO Star Wars sound and with plenty of familiar themes revisited.  I really did not like the film that went with this, but the music isolated is fantastic.  In many ways to me this seems like THE last, great soundtrack by Williams, as there isn't much beyond this that was quite as fantastic ('Attack of the Clones' featured too much copy-and-paste reuse of material [not sure if that was Williams' decision or a sound editors], and with 'Revenge of the Sith' there just wasn't enough material released on an OST [the best you can find are some fan-made releases on YouTube, which is unfortunate]).<br /><br />The opening title music is fantastic, and I recall that it was thrilling to hear Williams theme again in the theater (I also remember the subsequent disappointment watching Clones in the theater and instantly identifying the reuse of music from the previous film).  The Duel of the Fates music is a powerful theme for a battle with a sinister villain, and Anakin's theme (although it seems to mostly vanish by the third film) was a wonderful work of art, and part of me wonders if Williams wrote some of this material back in the early 80's and shelved it somewhere, knowing that one day he'd be revisiting these characters for an inevitable prequel?<br /><br />If you want a high-level summary of the main musical cues and themes of the film, go with this score, but if you want a more comprehensive collection of music look for the Ultimate Edition instead (it's not quite \\"ultimate\\", though, as there does appear to be some copy-and-paste re-usage of music, such as repetition of the same cue when the Jedi fly out of Naboo).
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to someone who is looking for a leisurely yet engaging read. I picked this up and couldn't put it down! Plot twists are very tactful and well thought out. Although some aspects of the book may seem outlandish, it's a very good read.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|A good app for all magic fans out there.  Definitely pick this one up.  Ten dollars may seem steep but for the amount of playtime available its worth every dime.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is the only cord that will power on my 1st generation Kindle Fit there are no other cords designed to work.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This one was a nice continuation of the series. I was bummed when I finished it and realized there would be at least one more book!! Good story, more sexy drama!

B005VGMYZM|3.0|Andre Rieu is very popular and seems to be re-introducing Operetta type music to his fans, but I prefer more classical music like the Atlanta Symphony performances.

B0011NVCSO|5.0|Incredibly beautiful album that is only accentuated on vinyl. And for such a great price, its a no brainer and a must have.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie had a great story and my two little boys love it so much that we've seen it every day since we got it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very well written.Characters are well developed. Writers are conscientious of the period in which thier characters are living.A good read for the TV. Not a fan of TV however there's a few exceptions, and I'm glad to say Downton Abbey is one of them.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Haven't loved a book like this is a long time. A lot of twists and turns! Hard to put down
B00846REIS|5.0|What a great, interesting, engaging read, I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series.

B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I thought this book was easy to follow, I liked the story examples which served as bridges to comprehending how things are taken through the eyes of the other person. I think this is a great book for couples who are struggling to understand why their efforts may be lost on the other person, it's because you're not speaking the same language. Speaking differently isn't an easy task but I think this book gives a better understanding of why continuing to try is so key to a successful relationship.

B00CMQX84A|4.0|I am such a fan of the original beach movies - and own them all.  While this is a Disney TV movie, the writers were spot on with the characters, music and humor.  Adults will like this movie too.  It had EVERY cliche from the 1960's beach movies, but that's what makes it so funny and endearing.  Kandy Kane would be proud!  Hope they make a sequel, it was that good.  Now, if I could only get a poster of \\"Wet Side Story\\"!...
140006922X|5.0|I'm currently about 2/3 of the way through this book, and it's definitely put me on the road to read more books about the historical Jesus rather than Jesus the Christ.  In a word- Excellent.  Aslan is thoughtful and objective, and I enjoy that in an author.  That's not to say he doesn't drop the ball a few times.  He doesn't footnote worth a damn, but he does include extensive notes (arranged by chapter) at the end of the book.  Most people won't read them, but at least it's there. You can argue over some of his textual dating, but the whole narrative is both impressive and persuasive.<br /><br />Aslan's writing style is pure storyteller (in the best possible sense), taking his exploration point by point and presenting a real picture of the world Jesus lived in- both how it developed prior to his birth and events that affected his followers afterwards.  He doesn't delve deeply into the scholarly debate over authorship or changes to the various texts, but there are other authors that can serve that purpose.  Get this book as a readable overview, and use it to leverage further study.<br /><br />Normally, I'd wait until I'd finished to write a review.  In this case, I saw a sudden spate of one star reviews thrown up on line- mostly from people who don't appear to have actually READ the book.  Unfortunately, they weigh just as heavily as someone who has.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I'll be honest, after years of only owning a 360 I went out and bought a PS3 just so I could play \\"The Last of Us\\" (which BTW is awesome) and having been strictly a 360 gamer for so long this controller seemed like it would be a perfect fit - and it was except for the large unresponsive zones in the controller thumbsticks. I'm not even particularly picky when it comes to controller sensitivity - but these \\"dead zones\\" were too large to even play a game like The Last of Us without it driving me nuts. I much MUCH prefer the shape and feel of this controller but ended up going back to the dualshock ps3 controller because it was so bad.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|This is yet another professional and enjoyable set from this man.  He sets a mood that will help comfort your soul and help you think and feel alright for a while.  What you need is what you get.
B00051E906|5.0|It works.  Its small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.  It is simple to use and a lot cheaper than a real geiger counter. Like other reviews I tested it with an old gas mantle that I had for another radiation project and bingo: I got a reading.  It seems fragile and I have no idea how accurate it really is but as a scientific toy or to do a scan this really does the trick.  I've gotten a couple of really high readings ( false? readings).  I don't think I live next door to a  super nova. so I take the accuracy claims with a grain of salt.  I didn't have problems with the manual - it explained enough for me - I'm casually interested in detecting radiation.

B008JFUR10|5.0|I think we all agree that nobody in their right mind would want a BluRay + DVD + kitchen sink combo pack, but I'll gladly pay a few extra bucks to Legendary/Warner Bros in convincing the studios for part 2 of this movie! :D
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game from gameloft ever! I hope they come out with more games like this. Like Despicable Me2: Minion Rush!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Neil Gaiman has written yet another of his classic modern fairy tales--steeped in mythology, woven through with vivid imagery and populated with memorable characters.  It's a wonderful read.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I wasn't sure what to buy to protect my kindle and went with this one because it was cheaper than the others. But it is a very nice case and you can make it stand up so you can be hands free, and you can swivel the Kindle in the case you can have it horizontal or vertical. I even suggested to my mom to get the same one and she likes hers as well
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|I had a serious addiction to this movie as a kid and recently watched it for the first time as an adult. Still awesome and very enjoyable for the flashback aspect. Full commitment to their roles may have ruined the actor's careers, but it sure made this a great flick.
B00BESM14U|2.0|Movie was good but it was a very sad movie.  the funny parts did not out weigh the dark sad parts.
B0094M4R3Q|3.0|The gf loved this one, I liked the book as  child more, but they did a great job of bringing Roald Dahl's imagination to life.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Showtime offered a free preview weekend about a month ago and I discovered the series &#34;Dexter&#34;.  Since I watched the seventh season marathon, I had to know what happened in all prior seasons....found a few seasons at Target for less than $15 and then ordered up to the sixth season from Amazon...love this show, and I'm not sure why!!!  All I know is that even though he is what he is, I still cheer for him!!  The casting is well done, the writing very good, and the plots just get better.
B000J2BRQU|2.0|The sound mix was awful. All the music and effects were pumped up to ear-splitting, and the dialogue was assinine. It's like a child's fable of an Anglo version of stereotypical Japanese.  The gangsters were totally unrealistic.. Not on par with the others..
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I very much enjoyed this picture.  It had s good story line.  Fine animation.  It was very well made movie.

B00190KZUU|5.0|I love the heart, imagination and creativity that went into this movie. Make life all that you want it to be.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|To begin, I am in no way a \\"gamer\\" but a 45 yr old father of two. I watched this movie with expectations of poor acting, cheap looking sets and a ridiculous story line. My expectations were wrong on all fronts. Although I am not a gamer but instead a sci-fi fan, this movie and apparently the entire Halo premise is precisely what I look for in a story. This movie was first class all the way. The acting was much better than I had expected even though most of the young actors are not \\"well known\\". I did recognize one actress who played in \\"The Lion,The Witch and The Wardrobe.\\" She does an excellent job here as well. At any rate, I enjoyed the movie and if you are a person who is not completely familiar with the game(like me), then this movie is STILL for you!
0812550706|4.0|Everybody told me I needed to read this book. \\"One of the best books I've ever read\\", \\"My all time favorite\\", etc. etc.  I tried to read it about 3 years back, but couldn't get into it.  But with the movie coming out I finally picked it up again.<br /><br />The book is an interesting, fun read, and gave me lots to think about.  Under the layer of action that happens in the books Battle Room, and the trials and struggles of the main character Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin, Card is laying down little suggestions/questions about morality, society, and what is good and what is evil. I like a book to have at least some depth.<br /><br />The character building in the book is done well for the three main characters (all siblings): Peter, Ender, and Valentine.  But other than that, most of the characters, in my opinion, are glossed over.  I would have liked a little more information or background on Col. Graff, Petra, and Mazer.  But all that being said, I was pleased to see that all of the characters played a role and helped establish the story.<br /><br />The relationship between Ender and his younger sister Valentine and his older brother Peter help drive the heart and motivation of the story.  Ender absolutely loves his sister and absolutely hates his brother, and we as the readers do, too.  It brings a connection to Ender from the start.  Card does a nice job helping us understand everyone's beliefs, struggles and ultimate goals.  I have read by others that Ender has a strong desire for violence and that turned them off in the book.  I personally did not get that from the story, and felt his motivations and decisions - which were very difficult sometimes - were explained and helped us get a full understanding of him.<br /><br />Even though the relationships had a solid foundation, I struggled with the ages of the characters.  When the book starts, and Ender is carted off to Battle School, he is 6 (or abouts).  It's not that he's 6 that was hard to swallow, it was the dialogue and the level of communication that was taking place between Ender and his military figures or Ender and his siblings.  Card certainly helps us to understand that Ender and his siblings are all gifted intellectuals and unique, but even still, as I read the first 1/3 of the book (when Ender is still young) in my mind I was envisioning a 12 or 13 year old conversing.  The author almost forces the reader to envision the characters at older ages than they really are.  Anyway, not to nit-pick, but it was hard to keep track of.<br /><br />The idea of the Battle Room is intriguing and that that is where a good portion of the action takes place.  My only issue was that I had a hard time envisioning it.  I got the jist, but Card is very thorough with his battle sequence descriptions (to his credit) that it was hard sometime to get the full picture in my head, but I wanted to.  Regardless, the scenes in the Battle Room and other simulators that are brought up in the book help to build an understanding of who Ender really is and sets the stage for future reveals.<br /><br />One of the things I give Card kudos for and loved about the book was the technology that was used, and the attention to detail.  Seeing as how the book was written in 1985, Card envisions things that have actually come to pass over time.  Very impressive!  I envisioned characters using iPads and surfing the Internet forums and posting to blogs or chat rooms...in a story written almost 30 years ago.<br /><br />Probably my biggest beef with the story is the nudity. It is not detailed, it is not graphic, in fact there are no specifics mentioned other than to say that people are nude, but it just felt...inappropriate.  I understand that in a military setting, the privacy a person has is limited and people become comfortable with nudity, but I don't need to read about 6, 8, 10, or 12 year old boy being nude around his comrades, running around the halls nude, or even wrestling in the shower nude. Some may disagree, but I didn't think it had any necessary relevance to the actual story and was mentioned WAY too often.<br /><br />Aside from some enhanced dialogue for youngsters and the obsession with naked cadets, the book was a good read.  I wanted to get back to it and see what was happening.  I related to the character and his desire for a simple life, yet shoved into one where he had to sacrifice.  The themes of seclusion and the depths to go for war were very intriguing and made me want to see what was actually going to happen.  The book has some great twists and turns (two in particular) that were very satisfying and that I did not see coming.<br /><br />While it is not one of the best books I have ever read, it did manage to entertain and make me think.  I will also probably pick up the sequel just to see the direction the story goes (which is becoming less and less common in my reading).e, but I didn't think it had any necessary relevance to the actual story and was mentioned WAY too often.<br /><br />Aside from some enhanced dialogue for youngsters and the obsession with naked cadets, the book was a good read.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book had a great mix of suspense and alluring qualities. The whole book has a shady context because there is none and it's just as confusing for you as it is for the characters themselves.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I downloaded the Bible ap so that when I am away from home I have a copy of the Bible to read.  It used to be most hotels had a Gideon Bible, but any more that isn't always true.  Thanks for this ap!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Plenty of action...and especially interesting to one who has lived through the eighties and the obscure and not so obscure computer references in the pioneer days of personal computers<br />A recommended read for those interested in possible futures.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|They did a  great job continuing the story line. The acting is so well done you really like or dislike the characters. Love the scenery.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|It seems like there are two Tegan and Sara eras: After \\"The Con\\" and before Sainthood.<br /><br />After \\"The Con\\" Tegan and Sara put the conventional tools of rock (distorted guitar, pounding acoustic drums) back in the garage. Heartthrob progresses from their previous album Sainthood but without the high energy.<br /><br />Heartthrob is an honest record. The title should tell you it's unapologetically pop. The title says that the songs are vulnerable. It's all true. Due to the subject matter of the songs Heartthrob rocks the least of all their previous albums. The album opens with Closer which does rock but the energy levels off from there. My biggest criticism of this album was that it didn't change pace enough. I was waiting for a high-energy track and it never really came, although it did build to intense moments.<br /><br />The music on this album is almost entirely electronic/synthed and driven by lyrics and vocal melodies/harmonies more than anything else. This is where Tegan and Sara shine brilliantly. Throughout this album there are really powerful lyrics, great melodies, terrific backing vocal ideas. Really high-level stuff especially that they were able to keep things simple but still delivered complicated feelings that we experience well into our adulthood. This album is highly relateable. In that respect it's a great pop record b/c it reaches so many different types of people. This is an album where you can press play and leave it alone. It can be cheesy in spots but it's very consistent and has lots of good moments from beginning to end.<br /><br />People will not like this record if they are rigid about the albums So Jealous and The Con.<br /><br />Highlights (in track order): Closer, Goodbye Goodbye, How Come You Don't Want Me, Now I'm All Messed Up, Shock To Your System
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|simply written but heartfelt and sincere<br />touches on timely topics of inclusion, diversity, and family<br />great source to launch discussions
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This service is worth the price of the prime membership!  I have an infant and can't reliably watch any series so am inclined not to watch the shows I love until they're available on disc or on demand.  this service is as good as Netflix and we can plug our Google tablet into the TV so it's as if we're watching it live!
B00BTYFWEA|4.0|it was a funny movie when i first saw it several years ago .it is still funny today .thanks amazon.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm addicted.  I play all the time.  I got my friend hooked and now he's kicking my butt &amp; beating me at all the challenges, but I still love to play.  This is the only game I've felt compelled to review.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The Game of Threones show stays very close to the books. The story really brings the diverse characters to life!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addictive! similar to subway surfers but better! One of the better of the free games out there. I love the minions
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I think the reason this series got so popular is that it's about that unobtainably perfect man who starts out 'wrong', that is, with a spine, dominant, bossy, and becomes a grovelling wimp to please the woman. A little kinky sex near the start, until she teaches him kinky sex is bad. Then progressively less and less sex until it virtually disappears. Not so much erotic as silly romance.
B00BESM14U|4.0|This was a good movie with well-defined and memorable characters. Most of us can relate to the awkwardness of adolescence and High School. The only weak spot: the trauma was not introduced well. It was too amorphous. I guess that's how trauma is recalled, eh? But for the movie audience, it was a bit disjointed. Overall, it was well worth seeing.
031236198X|2.0|Was required for a workshop. Found it written so plainly it felt demeaning to read. Anyone can read it from about second grade and up.
030758836X|5.0|I've been reading a lot of terrible free kindle books lately (sorry, terrible free kindle book authors) so in the last few weeks I decided to finally read some of the books people have been recommending. I only picked this because I noticed the author quoted on The Demonologist, and the same day heard a librarian explaining to another reader that Gone Girl had an 18 person wait list (if that many people want it I'm willing to give it a go).<br /><br />I liked every part of this book, even the bits that annoyed me because the characters were making such blatantly terrible decisions. I think it's a testament to Flynn that I actually found myself thinking at one point 'but of course Nick would do that' as if he was a real person who was renowned for his bad planning.<br /><br />It's an interesting plot, served by strong writing and well developed characters. I really wanted to get to the end, while really wanting it to keep going so I could find out where else the story could go.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this, and even suggest you skip the 18 person library wait and buy a copy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is kinda like zoo tycoon but there's Dragons not animals.<br />Dragon vale is really fun because there all was get good ideas for new Dragons.<br />Plus they have really funny and clever bios
B009R659L8|5.0|Great book - I couldn't put it down! Would recommend to anyone who likes a fast paced, exciting and surprising ending.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton is well acted, produced & executed throughout the entire season.<br />The actors and story line always leaves you wanting more.<br />Warning: it may become a bit of an additiction.
B00DHNB5CY|3.0|Just okay. I was expecting more.<br />It was just one step up from the horny kids spending a weekend in the woods theme.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Awesome app. I was able to get it when it was the free app of the day. But I still think it's worth getting for $1.
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|\\"Youth\\" brought me in. I heard it on \\"all songs considered\\". Bought the album on impulse. The rest of the album is great. Really chill with some subtle hooks. I've had it in my headphones for the past three days.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Let me just say for those people talking about a made up movie MLP Fall, THAT'S FAKE! One even said they watched it on a Russian Virus-laden hack site, so face the FBI!<br />Any who, lets get to Equestria Girls. Hasbro, y'all blew my mind! I loved the way everything was done! I really liked the parts when Twilight was bumping into Flash... but what I really liked was how y'all did the singing! 2 thumbs up! *brohoof*
B00340I4KG|4.0|Cage's acting was a little over-the top but hey, when you're playing the part of a crazed con under the influence of controlled substances and bend on terrorist activities, I guess that was good for the screen. I prefer an old school pacino in Godfater anyday. Clod, business like unfeeling and that's was makes the success of those guys in real life.,...I guess. Always dig a good Travolta movie.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Awesome and fun game it's the best mobile game ever and you have to download it I just wish it had better servers and more players
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the game, was a little short but enjoyed every minute, looking forward to more rooms to explore and to challenge me
B003G4W49C|5.0|Totally love this book! It keeps you hooked from start to finish. One of the first chapter books I learned to read when I was younger and I grew up with it. First book that I downloaded when I got my kindle. I love it. Anyone who likes sci-fi should totally read it!! So excited for the movie to come out in November also. But the book is a blast to read! I love someone the things the characters say.. you're like, &#34;where in the world did he {mr. card} come up with some of this stuff??&#34; Haha, love it!<br /><br />5 stars, 2 thumbs up!! Love it, love it, love it!
140006922X|1.0|Was hoping for fresh perspective, perhaps some new archaeological insight, or even controversial new ideas.  Sadly, nothing to resemble that here.<br /><br />While reading, I kept thinking the opinions espoused sounded like old Islamic political propaganda that was spread more the a millennium ago with the expansionist aims of muslim conquests into traditionally Christian regions.  Google search confirmed my suspicion the Mr. Aslan is indeed an devout Muslim apologist.<br /><br />But, why the charade of a supposed objective historian?  Why lie?  Why deceive?  I suppose the reason is that most people wouldn't go to Benjamin Netanyahu for insights on the prophet Mohammed, or the Dalai Lama for a historical opinion of Joseph Smith.  Only problem is, this little deception leaves the reader with no joy.  I wish I had my money back.  Or, better yet, I wish I could reclaim the time wasted on this book.  <sigh>.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is the 7th of Neil Gaiman's books I've read.  One I rated at 4 stars (really 4.5 stars), and the others, including this one, I rated at 5 stars.  All of his books are either modern, adult myths or modern, adult fairy tales.  This one is a fairy tale.  From the very beginning, the excellent writing, characters, world, and flat-out creativity of the whole thing just grab your attention and don't want to let it go.  I was a bit bothered by how nasty the story gets near the middle.  But, then again, it's a fairy tale:  bad things happen in fairy tales.  So, I'm very happy to give Gaiman yet another Excellent 5 star out of 5 rating.
B00400NHRO|5.0|A terrifically cynical look at medical care and being a doctor that is emotionally compelling. Written by someone who obviously had firsthand experience with the events recorded in what I've heard people accurately describe as &#34;The Catch-22 of Medical Literature.&#34; Full of that truth one cannot contrive, and anyone who's been burned by an uncaring institution will understand what the protagonist is going through.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I've deleted this from my device, total waste of time. There is no instructions on what you are suppose to do. I found the puzzle, solved it and nothing. I also found other items in the room but nothing happens, What are you suppose to do, need much better instructions or demo to play this.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|Great album. Strong singer.Most of the songs are really good. A really great band. I was really surprised how good this group is.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|We saw this movie when it first came out and loved it then. We saw its successor and, a week ago, watched episode three for these characters. &#34;Before Midnight&#34; was closer to &#34;Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe&#34; than to what we remembered of &#34;Before Sunrise.&#34;  So, we rented &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; to see if we could connect the dots of their character development. We couldn't and now need to go to &#34;Before Sunset&#34; and watch that again to see if it provides some links.<br />&#34;Before Sunrise&#34; is a delightful day/night spent by a couple of young people of different backgrounds but finding a lot of philosophica and emotional connections with each other. It reflects a very possible intersection of two paths that can occur as young folks travel together and then split apart. Maybe such relationships are best if they remain happy memories of a single day or two.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|This movie does not take itself seriously and neither should you.  Anyone that grew up on 80's action movies should get a kick out of this movie.  Excellent use of Chuck Norris.  This movie also contains the best use of a smart car in a movie!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I enjoyed The Bat a lot but found it very different from the Harry Hole books that followed. This one took place in Australia and, though it had plenty of darkness and gore, it seemed less complex than of of its successors. I kind of missed Oslo.  It felt like I was getting to know an earlier Harry and see a bit more how he got to where he is now.
B004EBT6HE|4.0|A great read with typical Follett 'can't put it down style'.  I would have given it 5 stars but it was slower than normal for Follett to get started.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|This 75th Anniversary version has been completely restored, just like the Director (Orson Wells) presented it in movie theaters 75 years ago. A uniquely written and directed story - first in its class at the time.
0345803507|1.0|****SPOIL ALERT****<br /><br />I have read all three books because I have a problem starting a series and not finishing it. Although some women might want that kind of relationship, it didn't fit at all. Honestly, I started to skip through all of the two page long sex scenes because one, it was nothing new and two it's so poorly written that only a 50 year old lonely woman going though a midlife crisis (get my reference, the author) would get off too. I'm not saying that's why I read the book because I am a young, INDEPENDENT, woman... haha<br />This book could have been okay if it was by a better author who wasn't having a midlife crisis. Constantly reading the lines<br />\\"I drink him in as he...\\"<br />\\"He grabs my sex...\\" <-- really?<br />\\"I want him, hard\\"<br />Oh not to mention, at the beginning of the book her favorite breakfast is Pancakes with bacon, she then moves in with a millionaire (or is he a billionaire? I can't remember) and she has this woman who cooks so great but her newly found, favorite breakfast is GRANOLA CEREAL. If I was that house worker I would slap her so hard in the face.<br /><br />Although I did enjoy some parts of the book I kept telling myself \\"I really wish this was written more mature with better wording.\\" I was also confused on some of the 'technical' words that the author used, you can tell she looked up a word in the thesaurus and decided to go with what ever appealed to her, even if the word hasn't been used since the eighteenth century.<br /><br />And Oh my, we all knew she was going to get pregnant, I mean come on, the one person he 'falls' in love with he gets pregnant in less than six months. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGH, I'M SO MIND BLOWN RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT OKAY. Not to mention the 'mood swings' she was having in the car on her way to see her HUGE NEW HOUSE.<br /><br />God, this book is awful, and she did so much injustice to the plot that could have actually been something.<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie... maybe half the world can laugh at too just like we did with twilight. There are not two books, written by two poor authors one who has a dream of her being in love with a vampire and one who loves twilight and just had to write a more 'natural' book but really... it's all the same can't you tell?
1603429999|5.0|I am a new knitter and this book has given me much needed knowledge to tackle DPN knitting as well as circular needle knitting. Great resource! Highly recommend!
B0026Q8F6C|4.0|The only reason I gave this movie a 4 star and not a 5 star, is because their is a little to much swearing for my liking; But that just me.<br /><br />All in all, this is an hilarious movie that will bring you back, again and again.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Wonderful historic novel, I couldn't put it down.  The story was so interesting too, due to my family being from Ireland/Scotland originally.
6304806434|5.0|DVD was brand new, plays very well. It was well worth it to buy. Glad I made a excellent purchase.
B004GYY714|5.0|Still finding my way around the product, but it was the best solution I could find for streaming the cricket to my kindle fire in Thailand. Seems stable, good sound quality and pretty intuitive to use
B000001DWG|5.0|Probably the forefathers of grunge. An extremely amazing album. Especially Crown of Thorns, Stargazer, and Come Bite the Apple. Although every song from front to back is just absolutely amazing. It's so unfortunate that Andy Wood overdosed before they even released this masterpiece.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|My kids love this movie.  I found it very entertaining.  I like the environmental message it sends.  The songs are very catchy, too!
B000002GJH|5.0|Such an amazing collaboration album with Chris Cornell and the members of Mother Love Bone/Pearl Jam. And such an amazing tribute to Andy Wood. The sound on this album is just so unique.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. its like the best I ever played. I totally recommend it. because its a boss and is beastly.
B003L77GGA|2.0|The Final Season of \\"Smallville\\" was such a disappointment that I don't know where to begin to describe the pathetic and miserable season it was. First off, having almost all the \\"dead\\" characters (e.g. Lex and Lionel Luthor, Jonathan Kent) return was expected since they were integral to the show, but did anyone notice Lana Lang did not return to the final season's episode? True, she does have kryptonite infused in her body on the show, but at least show her from a distance or something. Her disappearance in the final episode cast a dark cloud and did not bring resolution to the show. Did Kristin Kreuk not want to be a part of the final season/episode? Hmm... Second, the villain, Darkseid, was introduced as a puff of black smoke. Ridiculous. In the comics and the animated series, he's not a puff of black smoke, but gigantic, \\"flesh\\", and intimidating. To introduce Darkseid as a puff of black smoke was disrespectful to the fans of this legendary/cult show. What were the writers smoking? It's no wonder, since Alfred Gough and Miles Millar left the show after season 7. Third, season 10, as well as season 8 and 9, could have been more if Bruce Wayne/Batman's character was introduced (just like most of the other Justice League members were introduced, except Green Lantern and Wonderwoman). Since Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent have history in the comics/animated films/etc. it would have been nice to see that on this show during the final 3 seasons. Yes, I realize \\"Smallville\\" is about Clark Kent, but since Green Arrow, Flash, and Aquaman were introduced, why not Bruce Wayne/Batman? It doesn't make sense.<br />What an awful ending to such an amazing show. If I were part of the production department, this show would have rocked in seasons 8-10. Oh well, too bad for the producers/writers of \\"Smallville\\" seasons 8-10. Their mundane writing and production for this show during the last 3 seasons ruined this show.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Loved it! I couldn't put it down and enjoyed all the characters. I was a fan of the shopahollic series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. Its not just running which gets boring after awhile but kt has in coo mini games and these awesome power ups.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game it is the most popular game to me<br />They should turn it into the popular Edition
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for the whole family! Haven't gotten bored with it and probably won't for a while. Well gotta go collect bananas
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i loved the book!!! but i want it go go on forever and to have a sequel!!!! kinda like hazel was with AIA
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great series, although a little heavy on graphic violence (medieval battles scenes) and gratuitous sex scenes (which could probably be reduced about 90% and still get the point across).
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Kind of says it all. I would have liked a longer game with more types of variety of mini games inside.
140006922X|1.0|This book is all personal opinion and without any scholarship.  Really not even worth bargain bin price. Anyone deciding to read this should make sure they understand the author and his bias first.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was a beautiful story about family . It touched my heart and I loved reading it ! It's a perfect summer read !
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to like this app; then someone tried to make it cool, or trendy or something else it doesn't have to be.  Just gimme the weather, and I will look elsewhere for entertainment.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Purchased this watch this week and, even though it looked great and had a nice heft to it, I was about to send it back because I thought the crown was stuck and I couldn't push the buttons!  The instructions, written very generically, mentioned nothing about how to use them, so here's the trick- for anyone else who is having the same issue.  In order to use the stopwatch function or to adjust the time, you need to unscrew the rings around the buttons so you can then push down the buttons or adjust the time.  I suppose most people know about this, but if you're like me, hopefully this will be useful to someone.  Otherwise, like this watch a lot- a dead ringer for the Rolex Daytona and seems to be quite accurate.
140006922X|1.0|It is clear that this author does know of whom he speaks.  A good book for those seeking truth is Jesus the Messiah by Herbert Bateman. Or better yet, try reading a really good book, the Holy Bible.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Richard Attenborough presents our earth - sky - sea in a series of visual feasts.  His books have been great, but this is so broadened one feels a part.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I swore over and over that I would never read these books. Too long winded, too violent and in my foolish opinion, too overrated. And then came the day where I was without a book, and not going to be home for another 3 weeks.  I downloaded the \\"teaser\\" first few chapters, and within the hour bought the book. I am officially hooked. I never give out spoilers, and I don't write long winded feedback. I will say this: yes, this is a violent book, but no more so than most murder mysteries. Yes it is a long book, but not so long that I wasn't heartbroken when I read the last page, wishing for more. I Love Love Love the STRONG women in this book. (Even Cercei) . I love that this author is not afraid to tell this story and not shy away from simple truths..sometimes the good die and the bad live. War kills not only warriors, but women,children and the elderly as well. If you are on the fence about this book, I hope I've helped sway you...I'm off to download the next book and make some popcorn!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think I might have &#34;walkers&#34; or &#34;biters&#34; withdrawal until the new season starts. I am truly impressed with how the writers keep this type of show interesting after having two great seasons.  The twists and turns just keep on coming in season 3.  Amazing show!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love it. I'm hooked. On book 3 in less than a month. I can't wait to see the movie.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Now, to be fair, I just wanted a really quick and easy camera and this is it. Easy to use, no trouble at all. If you are looking for top of the mark HD photography, you may want to add something else - but I already have that. This one, is just right.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love it. I'm hooked. On book 3 in less than a month. I can't wait to see the movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one we like to watch as a couple.  There is enough intellectual, comedy, and character depth to hook you after watching just the Pilot!  Hoping for a long run along the lines of Frasier.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|PDF files work fine. I had a book on my PC transferred it to m Kindle Fire and I'm am reading my book with no problems.
B00BY1F8UQ|1.0|The Keith Jarrett Trio, just going through the motions again: B-O-R-I-N-G. We've heard it all before - a thousand times. Don't waste you're money on something you'll play only once, maybe twice, hoping you may have missed something the first time (you didn't), cause there's nothing memorable here to come back to, Jack.<br />Time to retire the Trio, or at least get rid of the horribly inept sounding and rather ancient Gary Peacock. I'd replace him with Charlie Haden. Hey, now there's an idea!
B000SEIDR0|5.0|This book really makes you think about the high amount of processing done to our food and our weird reliance on corn.
B009AMANBA|5.0|the movie was a little dark, but I did like watching it. I like historic movies like Gettysburg, WWII movies. This was played well. I recommend it for people who like watching something the depicts things like it happens not as they think it should be. If they want a happy President and wife don't buy it. If you want a good movie go for it.
0385523394|4.0|This book hooked me. I know it's not perfect, but I've never had the opportunity to read about prison life like this before. Very gripping and ultimately opened my eyes to a whole world that I hadn't been giving enough thought.
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|Going back to the days before digital effects dominated film, the Evil Dead remake is disgusting fun.  The plot is coherent enough, and the gags are great.  I really enjoyed it.  Oh, and the lead actress plays a great creepy/crazy.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game a lot!! I like that you add people as your neighbor and gift each other gold. Super cute and fun!! I would recommend this game to anybody!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|very quick login. i love this app. easy to chat and check newsfeeds with this app. great tool for socializing
B005EHILV4|5.0|It works great, is built solid with metal chassis, and can be run off any USB charger as long as you have the right USB cable. I took it on a trip and use it at home to route audio between 2 samplers to avoid feedback loop and allows me to use either as source and either as destination. Mic pre is noisy at high gain but works fine- not a problem.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|love this app. makes it easy to log in and view my videos. a lot of great videos on here
B00CISC2DA|5.0|At first I was disappointed- nothing jumped out at me and the sound style was similar to their earlier work (which I own all of). None of the melodies and structures grabbed me but that all changed after repeated listening until I basically had it on 24/7. Interesting as I have had this happen with different albums over the years but did not expect a BoC album to do same. Love it.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|This is a really deep movie, but one of Jake Gyllenhaal's greatest.  Even the CD to this movie is excellent!
B000SVZIDA|5.0|I'm not a musicals movie person but the way this was done by creatively blending songs together as they did, it was well constructed. The movie also held my attention the entire way through so that also is a plus.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I bought this CD because it had the version of ET with Kanye West that I really like. This is the best version to buy!
B008Y73940|5.0|this was a very good movie.<br />Matthew McConaughey was good in this role.<br />Very Good flick. Highly reccommend.<br />Watch it TONIGHT!
B0035WTE2U|5.0|This is really great motivational music that my fiance uses when he boxes.  He lost his and just absolutely had to have another, hands down.  I'll admit, I like the music on it as well!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many books on this subject ,and him being a Doctor telling his story makes me believe even more.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this not realizing it wouldn't work on my iphone 5 as a charger but thankfully my sister has a kindle and she needed a spare so it worked out perfectly!
B0060CXAHC|5.0|Is a great movie my baby girl love it and so do I.<br />Very entertaining and sweet definitely recommend to every body
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Excellent family movie. Very little violence, although some parts would be scary for the little ones. The visuals are striking and the characters are excellent
B005HV6Y84|1.0|I just bought this cd like new because this way y saw in your description and all cd in the back face was all break
B000W94FIW|5.0|Very nice. Makes you believe that true love does exist that you only have to believe and truly let go.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I like this cd like new excellent..Thanks for your attention, this cd was the best, i will buy another time
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this game. It is fun and exciting. I just wish there were more ways to earn diamonds besides buying them.But I would definitely recommend this game to others.
B000LPI68W|5.0|It's easy to see why this little gal became the actress she is today. She was outstanding as was Jean Reno. Gary Oldman was actually fun to watch as &#34;the bad guy.&#34; An unlikely duo, but entertaining none-the-less.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Evangelicals. Texans. Corporate Apologists. Le Carre's latest will offend the lot, and to my mind he couldn't pick better targets to offend. As usual, the plotting's as tight as the prose. But what makes JLC stand out is his unerring understanding of the moral stench at the top of power structures, and his sympathy for those who come to realize that the can avoid neither revealing that stench, nor being destroyed by the stinkers when they do so.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|It was amazing, very well done, great animation.  It was never a dull moment, kept me interested and a great family movie, where children would love as well.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Best of the Black Keys yet.  Have to play this every time I get in the car, never gets old!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|For me, this book was just lovely - heartbreaking and enchanting and tangible and uplifting. This is the book I am going to recommend to anyone who asks where they should start in the land of Neil Gaiman.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is so much fun!!!! i cant put my kindle down! NEED TO PLAY MORE! i highly suggest this game for all minion lovers!
B0046B1KHG|4.0|Good balance of adult and child appeal.  There were a few adult specific comedy elements that I felt were inappropriate for children but this was FAR less than most similar films.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast at launch, even with limited applications on day one, is a fantastic streaming device for the cost of $35.<br /><br />Today this is not the Apple TV or Roku, but after using it for a few Netflix shows, YouTube videos, and video streaming from websites in the Chrome browser I am very impressed.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who are saying this device is nothing new from what is already existing, however, aside from the form factor this device isn't aiming to be something brand new. It's a low profile and with simple cable management, can be hidden completely behind the TV.<br /><br />If you are like me and have been considering a streaming device, but couldn't settle on what to get, do yourself a favor and consider this device.<br /><br />Google already has apps in their Play Store to utilize MLB.TV, HBO Go, Hulu, etc, it's just up the developers to add Chromecast support and i don't see why they won't do that.<br /><br />Unless you are completely biased towards Apple or Roku or paranoid about Google monitoring usage there's no reason to look down on this device.<br /><br />*** UPDATE 7/26/13 ***<br /><br />Amazon wised up and made their content unavailable for Chrome casting. I don't blame them, but hope this means they are working with Google form an app rather than shut out users.<br /><br />I have connected to Skydrive to view photos and documents, works really well. Not perfect, but great way to easily show off photos to a group of people.<br /><br />Had a few issues when the nexus 7 tablet was too close to our baby monitor so I think there was some interference, moved the nexus a few feet away from the monitor and connectivity improved.<br /><br />Again, I think this is a great $35 device with a lot of potential. A lot of places are still directly comparing this to AppleTV and Roku, I think they are doing all three devices a disservice in this comparison.<br /><br />Chromecast gets five stars from me for these reasons:<br /><br />1.Small and discrete. Easy to conceal behind a larger TV, 32\\"+. USB power from TV works.<br />2. Works on multiple devices. I don't need a Google product to make it work.<br />3. It is $35. Which is fantastic.<br />4. Extremely portable, adds no weight for travel to my computer bag<br />5. Android is the mobile OS with the most users worldwide, I'm not too worried about app adoption/integration. If there is no app adoption/integration then it is $35.<br /><br />Is see the negatives as:<br /><br />1. Limited content at launch.<br /><br />I don't deduct due to content for the simple reason that it has been three days since launch, the Chromecast was a surprise announcement and not the headline product. I am confident that content apps already in the play store will adopt the feature relatively quickly and easily.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was a little too black and white for my tastes, and in the same vein everyone except the main character wears their hearts on their sleeves to me.<br /><br />Still great for any mid-teen who enjoys reading, if a young child wants to read it I would suggest a parent read it first to see if they want to expose their child to occasionally brutal and descriptive violence.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Very hard game.<br />Dislike it because I can't figure out what to do next.<br />I would recommend it to others.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First --- I got mine from UPS this morning, and i've been loving it all day.<br /><br />1. Netflix works great -- browsing/choosing/controlling playback from my nexus 4 works beautifully.<br /><br />2. Tab casting also works great. I tried it out with SouthParkStudios, and it was flawless. Only downside (if it's a downside) is that you need to leave your computer in fullscreen mode if you want the southpark video to be in fullscreen.<br /><br />3. Youtube is awesome. There is a new icon on youtube videos that lets you cast to your TV.<br /><br />Welcome to the future, Gents.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I hate superhero movies, but I loved this movie. I'm glad my philosophy class forced me to watch it! :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|My granddaughter loves this, she is crazy about it..when she comes to visit, it's the first thing that she plays, sometimes I wonder if she wants to see grandma or play this game!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun and user friendly.  Would pay to have no adds.  I love playing this game. Most Mario like game out there.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|This is a great game but there's one flaw, you can only play for like 3 min.<br />I hope in the future updates they will have more time limits. Someday.....
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another in a long line of James Rollins excellent books.  Thrilling and very interesting science.<br />I look forward to the next one.
B004FHCH96|5.0|This is a must-see film. It's one of those movies you have to watch over and over again. It's captivating, thrilling and suspenseful. I have seen it many times and would not think twice about watching again. I love having it at home so I can watch it whenever I please.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|It kept saying the Facebook thing and then going back to the home screen and it made my photos really blurry. I don't think it's worth the room on your kindle. -.-
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|too many intertwining stories,confusing. has to read synopsis after watching film.span of story a long time for general audience.at end just ok.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is a great app simple, ease, effective I never even got the pro version. I don't even know what the difference would woud be because the free version is not missing any thing.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Fun to put together as is described or make your own fun. Love the colors. Super fun, cute and a great way to spend time.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I would love to give this five stars but I have accidentally tapped on a advertisement a bout a hundred times and randomly they just take up the hole screen. But on the up side it downloads any video and even now when I can't watch many YouTube video's because I need a flash play that the Kindle can't even use but I can download those video's and watch them anyway.
B004I744AS|5.0|After I tried a couple of other apps for a dictionary, I settled on this one. Not only was it easy to use but there's a couple of games, word of the day, interesting facts etc. I find it fun and entertaining. For me, it's much more useful than anticipated. Highly recommended
0785814531|5.0|I was looking for a complete, affordable edition of Poe, and this fits the bill.  Still, I am hard-pressed to review the actual contents.  The horror stories (there are even horror poems) are scarely disturbing by modern standards, but nobody had ever written stuff like that in the mid-1800's.  It's probably the better-known poetry that the newcomer should start with: &#34;The Bells&#34; being an immaculate exercise in rhythm and phrasing (it &#34;scans&#34;), &#34;The Conqueror Worm&#34;, and his signature piece, &#34;The Raven&#34;.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love the characters they built... very real interpersonal dynamics. This isn't my world, but it's believable. I relate to the main character's struggles. A+
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Am just re-viewing this after quite a few years.  It develops nicely, good believable characters, and a nice set of plot complications.  I'm enjoying it all over again.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|I wasn't sure while I was watching the first episode, but by the second episode I was hooked. The storyline is really interesting and the acting is pretty good. There are moments when it can feel a little like a renaissance fair, but those are pretty few and far between. Overall, it is fun and pretty good history lesson to boot.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful series! Love all three seasons so far!<br />I was so pleased to find season three of Downton Abbey to be offered to Prime Members!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love this app I just wish it worked all the time. It freezes and sometimes won't open on my kindle. I would've given five stars if I didn't have to delete it and 're download it.
B00CRS88IO|3.0|This is a pretty good book.....I have no real negative or positive opinion.<br />I would purchase it again and would read others.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really liked the plot and found out alot of slamming.  The main characters were interesting and I liked the two young brothers, especially the one that talked backwards.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|One of my favorite classic movies. It is a must see...again and again and again and again.  Let your belly sag and enjoy the movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I didn't think the quality on this game would be as good as on the ipad but it is still very fun. buy this.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great story. Lots of twists and turns. I'm glad there were finally some happy moments in this book. The last one got a little depressing with only bad stuff happening to the main characters.  Now I have to decide if I will keep reading and really ruin the show for myself...yes, I probably will.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|My internet link consistently downloads at over 11.5 Mbps. This movie was consistently interrupted with reported download speeds sometimes indicated to be less than 1 Mbps. I can only assume this is caused by inadequate bandwidth on Amazon's server. Boo! Other than that the movie was okay.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is hilarious!! I watched the first season on Netflix and had to buy this whole season bc I missed it in tv. Worth every penny!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very solid variation on the now classic Temple Run theme. Bonus: My daughter is crazy for this game. She plays it until the battery dies.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I downloaded this just out of curiosity and I am having loads of fun with it!  Even though it was free it was still worth the time it took to download it.
B00BUKZ4O6|5.0|One of the funniest movies out there not just for kids but adults as well. the 3d is awesome as well.
B009MYAQOA|5.0|Ms. Horan has written a compelling, well-researched book about seven years of Frank Lloyd Wright's life which celebrates his vast talent while demonstrating his flaws. An American original, and a certifiable genius, he was also careless with money, chalk-full of hubris, careless of many relationships and, yet, as written here, engaging and likeable.<br /><br />The love story between Mr. Wright and Mrs. Cheney is finely drawn with equal parts of joy and tribulation.<br /><br />The tragedy (no spoiler, here) was heart-rending but written with clarity and a wealth of description.<br /><br />Superb pacing and economy  of  words as well as  the well-crafted　story
B001LM1456|3.0|Not one of the best hulk to say the least but it was enjoyable to watch, at least worth 1 watch to see for yourself
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great entertainment, writing and acting are top notch, This show is very smart. It's funny, dramatic, The characters are engaging. The episodes just get better and better as more of each character's back-story comes out.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Overall this is a great mouse. When received, I noticed that the product box was quite bent at the bottom. I know this wasn't a problem with the mail service, since the Amazon box it was shipped in was in perfect shape. This bent box however did not compromise the mouse at all due to the mouse being suspended in the middle of the box in plastic.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very precise feeling<br />-Very quick and responsive<br />-Easy to set up software<br />-Easy to use software<br />-Cheaper than other gaming mice<br />-Ability to change color of \\"Anker\\" symbol<br /><br />Cons<br />-Not all colors work properly. Some of the colors are unable to be shown, and instead show up by an extremely washed out pinkish/white color. (Not a huge deal though, since you can't change any colors on many other mice, so what it can do is great)
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Great entertainment, writing and acting are top notch, This show is very smart. dramatic, The characters are engaging. The episodes just get better and better as more of each character's back-story comes out.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've read and read most most books Brandon Sanderson has to offer, and he never ceases to amaze me with his incredible character and plot development! I can't wait to read more in this series!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Great entertainment, writing and acting are top notch, This show is very smart. It's funny, dramatic, The characters are engaging. The episodes just get better and better as more of each character's back-story comes out.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|As expected this app is easy to use and works well. I usually prefer the website to the real thing but this changed my mind.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great entertainment, writing and acting are top notch, This show is very smart. It's funny, dramatic, The characters are engaging. The episodes just get better and better as more of each character's back-story comes out.
B0074YVW1G|3.0|Loved the science. Felt it was a little too much self justification and even anti extrovert. Perhaps that was just because I am extrovert?
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 is really great. I enjoyed it very much. I hadn't seen it on TV so I really enjoyed it. This is such a suspenseful show and having the DVD was great as I could go back and repeat some scenes.<br /><br />Marg
B004DLPXAO|4.0|While working full time and taking classes on-line, the kindle app is ideal. I can buy books for school and take them with me wherever I go - whether I have an internet connection or not. (sometimes it takes a while to load)<br />Fantastic app!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Great game, music, animation.I even upgraded to the full version so I have more levels between candy crush saga.fun play time
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing!  A whole different take on the typical romance novel from a man's point of view.  And not just any man, an egotistical, arrogant, self-absorbed man.  This book is written superbly.  This donkey of a man draws you in to his side of things by making you think that he's talking to you.  Great read!
1455523550|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and all the different people Nicholas Sparks brought into it.  I would only have to warn people the movie is absolutely dreadful compared to the book.  I know that happens a lot but this movie really was horrible.  The book is a MUST read!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Great book. On to next in series. I hope it's as good as the last books. Wonder what's going on in 40.
0425263924|5.0|These are one of my favorite series, I love how she write and captures the souls of two messed up individuals and gives them love they cant let go of.  I could not believe when I was almost finished with the last chapter she was not wrapping things up..It's not over yet! yay!
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I love Vevo BUT when i try to login to facebook it doesn't work. I tried to login with fb soo many times and it still doesn't work. However if you don't have a playlist on vevo already then download this app and make one. Its simple and easy to use except for my kindle. I will stick with using vevo on the computer thank you.
B005LHOKFS|3.0|It's too hard to find what I want and jump around on this mobile version.  It's ok in a pinch but not enough like the real website.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such a quick read! This book was very eye opening and enlightening. It made me stop and think and be grateful!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this movie!  P&P is my all-time favorite, but this adaptation is wonderful!  The music is outstanding, and the plot follows the book closely. A definite must-have chick flick.  Root and Hinds do an amazing job! I watch it about once a month, and I never get tired of it!  Beautiful story, great acting!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 was excellent with many surprising twist! I look forward to Season 4. Great writing and acting. I'm excited about the storyline.
0525478817|5.0|this is for my sons book report this summer. He has not read it yet. i appreciate your help. thanks
B009T3AHDE|3.0|Movie was good, It was kind of hard to get....Movie extremely long and slow. Robert Pattinson  did an excellent job with the character portrayal...It was on point with the book. Delivery time could have been sooner. Overall, good movie. Ending was ?????
B00338CMTI|5.0|this is for my sons book report this summer. He has not read it yet. i appreciate your help. thanks
1400052181|5.0|I enjoyed the read, a bit slow and times and the language was a very true to form....The book was a very good read...I enjoyed reading the book....I would buy it again and recommend it to friends. I really liked the book...
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was good and how are you doing are you good i fine hie wind surfing was awesome<br /><br />Goodbye<br />TOm
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My son and daughter enjoy the game. For a free game it's not that bad.i will continue to keep it on my kindle
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game good!  its challenging yet entering!  My brain loves it!  My whole family works together to solve each level.  We fight to see how can find the clues first.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I'm so sad to be finishing this book.  I have read all of Kate Morton's books and am horrified that I have no more to read.  My favorite thing about these books is the way two or three stories become one so flawlessly.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this series and love being able to watch it on amazon prime. Great feature. Hope season 3 is available on prime soon.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Action humor and a degree of campiness. Entertaining movie but not a great movie.<br />Great cast of characters helped this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!!!<br />It's great for kids and it's very entertaining.<br />I love the graphics in this game and how they are pretty realistic.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Didn't find this book appealing. Started off ok, but lost interest. It is my personal opinion though. I prefer to read books with godly morals in them. So be your own judge as to how you will enjoy reading this book!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love all aspects and levels of this game. The longer you play the more you have to use your brain. You're essentially playing against the computer. Not a game for the quick and easy player. It IS a skill challenge.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|The app sometimes loads fast but most of the time it takes forever to load and buffers through most of the video making it hard to enjoy the video but if you have a very good internet connection then this isn't a problem for the most part.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Really, really loved this game.  Had reached high level, had acquired large friends group, and collected large amount of items.  Then, my Kindle broke and was replaced by Square Trade (yeah!!).  Unlike all other apps that the cloud stores, you will lose your status and need to start over.  Fortunately, Amazon was great about refunding many of the charges I made buying stuff for the game during weak moments of addiction (which has added up).  It's a game, right.  But I was very invested with time, dedication, and money.  Think twice before you take the plunge.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has some great puzzles and intuitive controls, but unfortunately some of the solutions seem to be completely revealed with the lens you find early on. Regardless, finding each solution is rewarding, and once I got into the mindset of this game it was hard to put it down. Great for a couple of hours, but basically no replay value ... unless you have problems with your memory.  The Room is absolutely worth the price; it is a memorable and unique tablet experience.
B00821OX98|5.0|I just loved the show. The story is so gripping and all the characters are played out really well .
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|OMG I was attracted to this trilogy at first sight. Loved it all of the way though. The epilogue, oh that... It was perfect! Until that last sentence. That last sentence was terrible! Why did it end with THAT?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse. This is a great game. I love how you can train the horses. It's so fun and interesting
B001SKB1Y0|5.0|Rip-roaring fun. Two somewhat clueless American women having &#34;important life experiences&#34; with a Spanish Lothario (very nicely played by Bardem) and his unhinged Spanish partner (Penelope Cruz acting crazy). The clincher, for me, is that the Spanish pair are appallingly bad artists. So it all works out very well as a complete fools' paradise.
B007SGM084|4.0|I( am enjoying this well written book that has many twists and turns and it lives up to its reputation
B008JFUR10|2.0|Even though I enjoyed the movie a lot and came to Amazon intending to buy the blu-ray, I find that I increasingly resent being forced to buy the \\"Blu-ray+DVD+UltraViolet Combo Pack.\\" All I want is the blu-ray disc and I don't want to pay $25 for it. I'll wait until there's a better option.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It was wonderfully entertaining.  We loved it!  We can't wait to see Red 2!  There were a couple of times when the movie stopped.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I read this, oh, since this is the 10th anniversary edition probably nine years ago or so.  It was good.  I grew up in Wisconsin, so I remember going to some of the places it talks about.  Someday I hope myself to be an American God.  That would be cool.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|A very lucid and straight to the point discourse, that absolutely demolishes the notion of religion. Very inspiring! I recommend highly.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This story kept my interest and had quite a few unexpected twists to it. Clever characters who were good actors for the fake filmmaking company.
B005544V6A|4.0|I can't say the show is exactly original but dialogue is good, the acting is well done. I wish I could dress like these characters. It is at time a bit soulless but come on.... they are lawyers. Also remember this is a TV show. The thought of a super genius posing as  high end attorney and NOT getting caught is beyond impossible but then again look at most shows. Are they in any more of a realistic reality? Let's face it we watch for entertainment and to see a street smart kid out do out smart Ivy League Harvard grads and bring a little soul to the soulless! I watched this on Prime and found as soon as one episode ended I wanted to watch the next. I look forward to season 2 and 3.
0399255370|5.0|I purchased this book for a family with a 3 and a 5 year old.  I enjoyed the book so much I ordered a second copy for home.<br />The kids loved this book. Very creative-each page is a letter from the missing crayon and a picture colored with the crayon.

B000F8O35U|1.0|1. Hoard found treasures, do not attempt to restore them to their owners.<br />2. Maintain a secret stash of gold, hidden even from your family. Revel in it. Let the gold be where your heart is.<br />3. Disobey every parental instruction possible. Show no remorse, quickly dismiss repentance.<br />4. Do not respect your father (of course you have no mother, this is Disney). And show no respect for any other creature either. You have all the answers after all, and a happy ending will prove that to everyone, esp yourself.<br />5. View your family (sisters in this case) as evil and entirely against you. Do anything you can to make it on your own, get away from them, and achieve something better, while excluding them from your life.<br />6. Focus strongly, even exclusively, on your youth and beauty, not your character or values. As beauty is what lands a rich and handsome man (again, the qualities which matter most). What will happen when you age?<br />7. Do indeed work with Satanic Black Magicians, as the results will be positive, in the end. Remember, never forget, the ends ALWAYS justify the means!<br />8. Self-serving rules! Look out for number one. Be sure to shun those that stand in your way! Trick them if you can. Tell lies if possible to deceive them. Always use the back door. You know what's right. \\"They\\" do not.<br />9. Do not bother with your commitments or obligations, these are tiresome! And they do not serve you personally, at this time! Show irritation if some naysayer attempts to remind you of your obligations.<br />10. All and all an excellent film for young girls to watch over and over and over. Highly recommended.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This is a truly fantastic show! Great characters, good plot, good acting.  I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who likes a witty, intelligent TV shows that isn't too unbelievable.  At times it can be a little &#34;bro-y,&#34; (some chest thumping and what-not), but it isn't over the top.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it kept me guessing all the way. a little hard. but that's what makes it fun. nice memory game. I loved it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It takes a while to get updates on kindles, kindle fires, tablets, e.t.c. My brother who has a iPhone got all the updates before me I got them a month later.

B00DHNB5CY|1.0|One if Hollywood's endless stream of inferior remakes. The story is terrible. The characters are moronic. Special effects are very good but mindless gore does not make a movie. This movie has none of the charm of the original.  Save your money, avoid this poor excuse for a remake!

B0026OR2PE|3.0|An interesting take with a lot of personal experience that makes the book worthwhile to read. Stories galore across from the Einstein E=mc squared to Darwins theory and talks about the acceptability of an innovation to become a fact.<br /><br />A easy read book and a small one to boot, gives a lot of inputs as to what makes an idea tick, how to sell an idea and a dump of lot of things with stories in each chapter, however, these are experiences and never gives as to how to go about it. Well it is nice to read but as to the practical applications the books is wanting.<br /><br />However, given the various books that you can read on innovation, this one does make you think and with the excellent examples is worthwhile the time you spend. Unfortunately the book makes you ask more questions for which it does not answer. The why's are still missing.
B004P8A7J2|5.0|I have to say, going into the movie I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  However, after sitting through the first half of this movie, I was in the middle of a wild roller coaster ride of emotions.  Definitely recommended for anyone!

I followed the Disney link's instructions to no avail!!! my son and I are frustrated since our old reef had lots of rare fish and plants. now we are starting over just so we can play.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|OK, I admit that this book is geared toward a much younger crowd, but occasionally I look for an easy to read, less challenging book to read that I can easily pick up and put down, remember what happened, and just pick it up again without having to ponder exactly what happened the last time I read it.  This book was SO easy to read, interesting and had a different approach to a &#34;Cinderella type story&#34;.  I really did enjoy reading it!

B0009P5YXO|4.0|I was a little disappointed at first, because it is all plastic and, to me, seems a little cheap. However, after playing with it for a while it's a fun toy and a great gift for my boyfriend. I think any fan would love this item. The only thing that really bugs me is that the interchangeable pen tips do not lock onto the end very tightly (making it somewhat difficult to remove the cap without the whole end popping off). Even though it is a little cheap, I think it's worth it if you're a fan of the show!
1609611543|5.0|If you want to eat health this is a good read. I'm not allergic to wheat, but wanted to know what I could expect if I stopped eatting it. This book is awesome and very helpful.
0425263908|2.0|I started reading this book out of pure boredom (and it was online), and I have to say it deeply depresses me that this kind of \\"literature\\" is so widely successful. The plot (if you can even call it that) is weak and the characters are inconsistent, and I find Cross's and Eva's relationship totally unbelievable. I mean, the whole book takes place in basically two weeks, and anyone that thinks they've fallen in love after a week is ridiculous. Also, their names are stupid.<br /><br />That being said, the sex scenes are pretty hot, though a little redundant. In order to get the full effect of such scenes, there should be a little more build-up between them. 50 Shades of Grey's are hotter, but maybe it's just because I read them first.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for mommy porn and a good escape that takes no mental effort whatsoever, then you've found the right book. After I was finished, though, I just wanted to go back to Christian and Ana.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|REVIEW:<br />I put off reading this book...for a WHILE. But I got desperate Monday night (the 10th) and figured, \\"What the hell! I don't have anything else loaded up that I feel like reading.\\" ...I couldn't put it down. I was done the next morning!<br /><br />These are the only words that comes close to what I'm feeling:<br /><br />Astounded<br />Amazed<br />Astounded<br />Stunned<br />Surprised<br />Staggered<br />Startled<br />Shocked<br /><br />...and so many more!<br /><br />The characters and dialogue are just so well written... and I never cared for Slam Poetry before; I made fun of it to be honest. But after reading some of it in this book, it's opened me up to new possibilities.<br /><br />Now, yes, some of the plot is cliche, some of it you see coming from miles away. There are times you see the train wreck coming, but you JUST CAN'T NOT READ!!! You HAVE to see what's going to happen!<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? HELL and most definitely YES!!!<br /><br />I'm now gleefully inhaling Point of Retreat which is the sequel to the book and the second in the Slammed Series. I'm every bit as pleased with this one. And again, I see some of it coming... but I HAVE to know how it ends! Wish me luck!<br /><br />GO READ THIS BOOK!!! NOW!!!
140006922X|1.0|Media reports have introduced Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim.<br /><br />His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio.<br /><br />  Aslan is not a trained historian. Like tens of thousands of us he has been formally educated in theology and New Testament Greek.<br /><br />He is a bright man with every right to hold his own opinion about Jesus--and to proselytize his opinion.<br /><br />As a sincere man, Aslan's Muslim beliefs affect his entire life, including his conclusions about Jesus. But this is not being disclosed. \\"Zealot\\" is being presented as objective and scholarly history, not as it actually is--an educated Muslim's opinions about Jesus and the ancient Near East.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years. Its conclusions are long-held Islamic claims--namely, that Jesus was a zealous prophet type who didn't claim to be God, that Christians have misunderstood him, and that the Christian Gospels are not the actual words or life of Jesus but \\"myth.\\"<br /><br />These claims are not new or unique. They are hundreds of years old among Muslims. Sadly, readers who have listened to interviews on NPR, \\"The Daily Show,\\" Huffington Post or MSNBC may pick up the book expecting an unbiased and historic report on Jesus and first century Jewish culture. (I will let my Jewish friends address Aslan's statement on MSNBC that, \\"there were certainly a lot of Jewish terrorists in first century Palestine.\\")<br /><br />As a journalist and author who is Christian I cannot imagine penning a so-called objective biography of Muhammad and then concealing my conflict of interest in national media interviews.<br /><br />In world history there are no religions more violently and anciently opposed than the crusading, fighting, at times blood-shedding rivals of historic Islam and historic Christianity. Even non-violent Muslims and Christians, like Aslan and myself, understand that we hold aggressively oppositional views--particularly about Jesus. National news coverage of \\"Zealot\\" has ignored this conflict of interest.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus--from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.<br /><br />Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark--because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.<br /><br />I believe in Aslan's right to hold and propagate any opinion. It's a right that, ironically, Christians do not have in many Muslim countries.<br /><br />My concern is that national media coverage be smart and forthright about this conflict of interest, just as it would be if I--a Christian author and pastor--wrote a book about Muhammad.<br /><br />Pouring praise onto \\"Zealot\\" as new information about Jesus, without explaining its author's devotion to a combatting religion, is blatant bias. This same bias would be unthinkable if the Christian and Muslim roles were reversed.<br /><br />With its riveting demolition of Jesus, \\"Zealot\\" will continue to attract interviews--some from reporters who want to see Jesus deconstructed. Many more interviews will come from reporters who simply don't understand that Reza Aslan has a horse in this race. He is not an objective observer, but, to use his own word, a zealot, with religious motivation to destroy what Western culture has believed about its central figure for hundreds of years. In many ways, this conflict is larger than Christianity and Islam. It is a conflict of Western and Middle Eastern foundations. These are great and important debates that we should welcome, but let's be honest about our motivations, positions and conflicts of interest as we dialogue.<br /><br />Let's hope reporters in future interviews will, being informed, mention the glaring conflict of interest in this Islamic opinion of Jesus. It is no more objective than my educated views about Muhammad, as a Christian.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is not new work from a historian. It is a sophisticated presentation of views that Muslims have held about Jesus for more than 1,000 years.<br /><br />John S. Dickerson
1781162646|5.0|It seems as if Stephen King writes three types of novels: (1) the ones filled with blood and gore, (2) the long-winded ones ranging to close to 900 pages--just finished one of those, and (3) the little gems like \\"Joyland\\".  This is a lovely book about an adolescent's first love, the carny life, and the troubles and challenges in life that can lead to increased maturity and insight or self-destructive behavior.  Mr. King writes well, has an acute understanding of character and how people talk and think (especially males), and the effects of life events on personality, especially the effects of earlier abuse or trauma on adult functioning.  I would put this novel in the same class as \\"The Green Mile\\" and \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\"--the Stephen King I like best.

0891419063|5.0|* I wrote this essay for my World Civ. 101 class<br /><br />Throughout this powerful memoir E.B. Sledge is fighting a war against the enemy and within himself. The stark realities of war breed an innate human emotion of anger within him. Though he hates the enemy, he does not hate the Japanese. Therefore, his attitude towards the enemy varies throughout the campaigns as he tries to remain humane. He respects his enemy and knows, “ As a wise, salty NCO put it […] when asked […] if he ever felt sorry for the Japanese when they got hit, ‘Hell no! It’s them or us!”’ (85).<br /><br /> The war, specifically at two points, makes him hate the enemy. The first time he directly states he hated the enemy is when he mentions the Goettge patrol. Here, he states that the deceptive tactics the enemies would conduct on his comrades created such hatred (33). He also adds, that the “passionate hatred” was a motivational tool used to withstand boot camp which later becomes a means of survival on Peleliu (33). Sledge also directly tells the reader that the mutual hatred shared by the Marines and the enemy resulted in an unwillingness to surrender (34). At another point of the book, this hate turned into a “homicidal rage and a vengeful desire to get even” when a Japanese soldier almost shot Sledge in the head with a light machine gun (114-115). This event triggers a mix of emotions that embodies his internal struggle.<br /><br /> As he fired away at several Japanese soldiers trying to escape a pillbox he says, “We felt no pity for them but exulted over their fate” (116). Soon after, he kills a Japanese soldier in a close range encounter in what seemed to be a slow motion ordeal with the way in which he described it. Though he earlier said he felt no pity for the enemy, he clearly did. Right after his close encounter he confesses:<br /><br />The expression on that man’s face filled me with shame and then disgust for the war and all the misery it was causing. My combat experience thus far made me realize that such sentiments for an enemy soldier were the maudlin mediations of a fool. Look at me, a member of the 5th Marine regiment – one of the oldest, finest, and toughest regiments in the Marine Corps – feeling ashamed because I had shot a dammed foe before he could throw a grenade at me! I felt like a fool and was thankful my buddies couldn’t read my thoughts.<br /><br />  (117)<br /><br />Here, Sledge is truly conflicted between paradoxes of thoughts. The savagery of war has made him feel ashamed of his own humane thoughts. In spite of everything, Sledge was able to show pity for the enemy. For example, one of his friends was trying to take out a gold-crowned tooth from a live Japanese soldier and Sledge shouted, “Put the man out of his misery” (120). He compared the ritual of taking the dead enemies belongings to “Indian warriors taking scalps” (120).<br /><br />Amid a fight for survival, Sledge almost looses all compassion for the enemy when a “tempting number of shining crowns” lure him to extract them from a dead Japanese soldier (123). Before he could Doc Caswell convinces him he should not because of germs (123). Sledge realizes Doc was trying to tell him it was the immoral thing to do.  Throughout the book, Sledge observes how his friends had turned into “ twentieth century savages” (153) and he tries to retain some of his sensitivity.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Sledge was very curious about Japanese cultures. His observation changed his stereotypical image of Japanese and admired their will. Though he hated the enemy he had respect for their bravery and improved combat skills. At first Sledge thought the enemy would be easily defeated because of their primitive, banzai, fighting style. To his surprise, the enemy had developed new tactics and he admired their fire discipline. He states that, “the Japanese were as dedicated to military excellence as U.S. Marines” (157).<br /><br />In conclusion, Sledge did not uniformly hate the enemy, but during battle it was a means of survival. His attitude changed from one moment to the next and with it his emotional state. In the end, Sledge remained humbled by the death of his friends and enemies because, “the dead were safe” (125).n conclusion, Sledge did not uniformly hate the enemy, but during battle it was a means of survival. His attitude changed from one moment to the next and with it his emotional state. In the end, Sledge remained humbled by the death of his friends and enemies because, “the dead were safe” (125).

But I was spellbound by this powerful and moving story before ever reaching the second chapter.<br /><br />Grissom wove a passionate tale which regularly fueled my outrage and inspired my hope that gentleness would overcome and integrity would prevail.<br /><br />I actually cowered behind my pillow as I read some of the horrific circumstances which plagued my favorite characters. This was a comparative study on the very best and the absolute worst of humanity. This account wreaked sleep-altering havoc on my emotions; yet the book would not be put down.<br /><br />Who is family to you?

0812983459|4.0|This is a love song with melodies of friendship, perseverance, and redemption.<br /><br />It is the all too familiar tale of two people who drift apart not for lack of love but because they've constructed a seemingly impermeable wall of petty grievance, distorted memory, and misperception.<br /><br />Newsflash! Communication by eye rolling, blaming and criticizing is not as helpful as actually speaking and listening. Joyce compellingly pens that unfortunate place in marriage where best intention fails to result in suitable action. We've all been the benefactors and the recipients...a scorching punitive blaze unexpectedly issues forth when all one worried soul intended to convey was his or her own sense of insecurity. If only we could all say what we mean and do what our hearts suggest.<br /><br />Though I stopped repeatedly to reread excerpts and consider my own actions, I couldn't quite give this book 5 stars because the final leg of Harold's journey to Queenie was not just torturous to Harold.

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Aslan found Jesus as a teen at an evangelical camp. But by college he was convinced that the \\"Bible is replete with the most blatant and obvious errors and contradictions...\\" (12) He discarded his faith but continued his work in religious studies. He now provides his own investigation into the life of Jesus.<br /><br />Aslan says the gospels are not historical documentations of the life of Jesus. He does not believe they were written by eyewitnesses of the events. After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70, Christians worked at transforming Jesus into a peaceful spiritual leader rather than a revolutionary Jewish nationalist. They created a Jesus that the Romans could accept, Aslan says.<br /><br />In this book, Aslan tries to reclaim the Jesus before that transformation. \\"The task is somewhat akin to putting together a massive puzzle with only a few of the pieces in hand; one has no choice but to fill in the rest of the puzzle based on the best, most educated guess of what the complete image should look like.\\" (22)<br /><br />Aslan certainly does not take what the gospel writers have written at face value. For example, he writes, \\"Whatever languages Jesus may have spoken, there is no reason to think he could read or write in any of them, not even Aramaic.\\" (56) He claims that Jesus debating with the rabbis and scribes, and Jesus reading from the scroll, \\"...are both fabulous concoctions of the evangelist's [Luke's] own devising.\\" (57) He also writes that predictions Jesus made, such as the coming destruction of the Temple, were \\"put into his mouth by the evangelists after the fact.\\" (90) Regarding the account of John the Baptist's death, \\"the gospel account is not to be believed.\\" (95) Luke invented the infancy narratives of John the Baptist and Jesus. (101)<br /><br />He certainly does not believe Jesus was divine. \\"...Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew and nothing more.\\" (129) The fate of Israel and the Jews was all that mattered to Jesus. (129) Also, \\"...the fact remainsthat the resurrection is not a historical event.\\" (173)<br /><br />So Aslan has invented a life of Jesus not based on the biblical accounts but based instead his study of the social and political scene at the time. His is merely an educated guess as to what Jesus said and did.<br /><br />Aslan claims the gospel writers have invented most of the life of Jesus they record. And I would say the same of Aslan. He has invented a life of Jesus based on his educated guesses and speculations. It is ironic he thinks we should take his invented account over the \\"invented\\" account of the gospel writers. I'll take the gospel writers.<br /><br />The positive aspect of this book is the vast amount of historical information. For biblical fiction writers, there would be lots of usable information available for creating characters and the actions they would do, since that is basically what Aslan has done with Jesus.<br /><br />Evangelical Christians like me will find this book very frustrating. I was disappointed in the book. I don't recommend it.<br /><br />I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of this review.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Every thing about the show was well done. The acting, the casting, the sets were superb. Loved it! Can't wait for the next episode.
B00006GO99|5.0|What can you say about except WOW. Monk  So you need more words?  Well, if you love jazz this is a cd you need to have.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Omg where do I start this book is to express the love and passion for Christmas and all other holidays
B0049VZ222|2.0|ok so this stream was great!  did it from my ipad.  The issue I have with this show is that it takes 5 episodes to talk about one thing!  Just speed it up and get on with it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This last book kept me on my toes! Kept pushing me here and there. Wondering why this and that happened and kept me begging for that one little hint of will it ever happen... Will the pain ever stop.... It kept me reading into the wee hours of the night just to find some sort of peace. I felt in this book as with the other two that i was a part of their lives. This book I will enjoy over and over again!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Man we have this game for everything from kindle to ipad and iphone you can tell that this is the game we love!
B008M0NDOK|1.0|crap waste of money would not recommend anyone buy this very limited use, sold it straight away on ebay for a loss.
B003V1WST6|3.0|A good summer beach read - no thinking involved for the over the top storyline.  A quick no-brainer.  exactly what I was looking for.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|For a movie with a great line up of  British actors, I expected it to be better than it was. This movie just didn't grab and keep my attention.
B000002LQD|4.0|A superb exploration of grief in the face of loss - great musical journey. Reed is brutally honest and captures the emotional struggle of accepting loss and death in an engaging way. Certainly not easy listening, but soulful and rich.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Very, very,VERY addicting and fun!! I don't know about the other reviews but this game is the strategy game gold mine!! Plus: it's 2 bucks, that's like less than a candy for this outstanding game!!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Good movie.  Well worth the rent if you want to see 2 of the up in coming actors work with a legend.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|Benny & Joon is one of my favorite movies!  It was great to watch through Prime for free and of course I enjoyed it.
B00DW39B2K|5.0|I love these 2 actors and felt they both worked well together.  I even thought Travolta did a good job conveying a Serbian contrary to what some others have written.  But then again, I am not rehearsed in knowing how a Serbian talks english. Just a well acted movie with right amount of suspense.  It does make you think after seeing it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so happy I love despicable me so much and was so happy when I found this game now everyone in my family plays it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super addicting! So much fun!! Its like a workout for your brain!!! Stay brain fit!! Flow Free is a must have all for everyone!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good movie, lots of action, Rd jr. funny as always as Ironman.  Definitely watch this.  Five more words required.....stupid...You'll get more reviews if you eliminated that.
B004NTDEXY|5.0|Bought AHX for for like $6.50 and realized the two pack was like .50 cents or a buck more, why not get a extra movie out of it. AHX is a great movie and AHOV is pretty good, nowhere near as deep as AHX but decent. If the price is close enough between the AHX single disc or the this 2 pack, definitely get the 2 pack. Right now there is $8.50 different so the single disc would be the way to go unless you actually like AHOV.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|This was a pretty interesting movie.  Funny at times.  If you grew up watching The Wizard of Oz you'll enjoy this.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book had me up for hours! I finished it in three days. My mind is still spinning from all the details. Definitely worth reading. No one should miss this book.
B0027MJU00|2.0|Long and drawn out. Loved gone girl but this book falls short. Also not as dark as sharp objects. The plot does pick up until<br />The end of the book
B00005N5RM|3.0|I had not known anything about this movie but i like<br />ones like this so got it on Dvd.The movie was ok but<br />have seen flicks alot better.<br />  I will watch it again sometime and maybe it will be<br />better the next time.(hopefully)
1118156315|4.0|The book guides you through a self discovery process that eventually leads to a deeper understanding of what makes you happy and what makes you special.<br /><br />Advice: take some serious thinking time while reading and applying this book for it to be effective.
B00000IMTE|5.0|Big fan of Blackmore's  RAINBOW and had this on<br />an album but i thought it was time to get it on Cd<br />and was great to hear it again.<br />  The CD sounded Great and was happy to get it.<br /> For all of Rainbows fan you cant go wrong on this<br />one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as I was with the first book, fifty shades darker was even more addicting! I couldn't put it down! Purchasing the last book right now!
B009R6GN22|5.0|Everything you want to know about Marilyn is in this book. I particularly enjoyed learning more about her childhood and how she broke into Hollywood.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I recently bought the book, so far I've enjoyed it very much. It's got great storytelling and it's very easy to read. I like how you make the connections through previous stories, and how the writer guides you.
B005544TRQ|5.0|At first, this show reminded me of Psyche, which I love, but I like the (slightly) more realistic premise of the show. Writing is great, character development is awesome. Watch it!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is an absolutely must see,a wonderful family movie.Keep a box of tissues handy,you'll need them.<br />The pure love and devotion Hachi has for his master is heart catching.Being based on a true story,it's not something you will forget.Buy this movie,you will love it as I do.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This season is everything that season 1 is, but more comedic and you cannot help but love (or hate) some of the characters even more.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I did &#34;the Hit&#34; and far and away recommend it to one and all,  mystery fans in particular... Love this character....Will Robie, too.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say? Adele is one of the most talented singers and songwriters to come along in a LONG while. LOVE this album!
B00DU74U74|3.0|The special effects were fine. The story was a little drawn out though.<br />Acting was very good. Might have been better to give explanation and or<br />show the invasion. End was very good though. You would think an advanced<br />race would have better equipment than shiny cars, considering their repair<br />devises for human body damage. Movie overplays romance. However it<br />is worth watching.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|just so predictable and  once the special effects of the  storm are over  not much happens. I suppose Naomi Watts did it for the cash
141694737X|5.0|a great &#34;tough&#34; book for a 2 year old who loves to be read to and likes to carry her books around
B00138H68M|4.0|The Strokes my not have been a radio success but still made/make great music. To this day &#34;someday&#34; has a sound and a riff that I will always recognize.
B00AEFXTDQ|5.0|Fantastic movie, and watching it in blu-ray makes it even better.  I would highly recommend the purchase to anyone who likes musicals
140006922X|1.0|In \\"The Zealot\\" the author says that Jesus was not God, denying the veracity of the divinity of Christ.<br /><br />He writes by deception and omission, fueled by his fanatical man-made religion of hate.<br /><br />What the great majority of people and reviewers do not know is that the author Reza Aslan is an Islamist.<br /><br />He is connected to the mullahs in Iran. It's a propaganda book.<br /><br />He is telling the Islamic view of Christ. This is what they're not telling you.<br /><br />As of this afternoon, the book has 73 one-star low ratings by the public.<br /><br />This review will make it 74 one-star low ratings.<br /><br />This shameful book of falsehoods belongs in the dump.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I enjoy this show very much--as much as Upstairs Downstairs (the older one) and Downton Abby. Can't get enough if them and this one rates right up there with them. Love it!
0140569324|4.0|This was a gift to my granddaughter and she loves it.  She is an avid reader and<br />she has enjoyed it over and over.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show! I was not aware of this show until a co-worker was talking about the 3rd season. I am glad he did and I am glad that Amazon has the first two seasons up on Prime. Very Entertaining if you like Sci-Fi
0375869026|5.0|I was very moved by this book, and feel like I want everyone I know (including all three of my kids) to read it. As has been well covered by now in others' reviews, Auggie is a 10-year old with a major facial disfigurement heading to school for the first time. Told from his point of view and the point of views of other kids in his life (his friends, his sister, her boyfriend), it does a wonderful job of capturing the unique voice of each character. I see some reviewers have said they found the changing viewpoints distracting, but I felt it was the reason the book was so powerful, because it gave us others' perspectives on Auggie's appearance and nature. It also kept the book from being too sentimental or Hallmark-movie like, because the characters each struggle to deal with their own feelings, including resentment towards Auggie and the attention he gets. No one in the book is without struggles or dark feelings at times, and everyone's realization of this is part of the power of the book. To me, this is a stellar coming of age story, where each character faces a crises of a different type and realizes they can choose what kind of person they want to be. They each choose kindness in their own way and come to realize how powerful this is.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I have about 10 pages to go but I am really enjoying this book. It is definitely entertaining but also a real education on how things work in other parts of the world and the trauma people go through in trying to relocate to other countries.  The names can be hard to read but that is my American ignorance! We usually only focus on English unlike the rest of the world that learns other languages.  I love the author's take, through her character, on Americans and some of our speech habits and ways of life.  We say &#34;fantastic&#34; about so much; even when it is something that is not that fantastic. True and I am guilty!<br /><br />The beginning 20-30 pages were a tad slow but then I became really caught up in the characters and the story.  I will have to find out how it ends tonight!
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Nothing gets me pumped more than watching Uma Thurman mercilessly murder so many people. This tale of revenge and heartbreak really gets to me every time, and I can never watch it without crying tears of joy, envy, and pain. This movie has it all. I recommend everyone buys it now. Because Uma Thurman.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this as a young child in school it was so much sweeter now. God Bless the author.  You brought me right into that garden both time thanks.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|yes, its listed as free but as soon as they have you hooked, you run out of tokens and have to buy more.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It's a good thing this was a free game. I'd have been seriously unhappy if I spent money on this. The game never did load, it froze EVERY time I tried to play.
034580404X|5.0|When my older lady friends---in their 80's--started talking about this book -- I thought what ARE they reading.  I forced myself to read it.  FUN FUN FUN
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The only reason I'm not giving this game 5 stars is because the current version only has 10 levels. The levels weren't  too difficult but they were enough to hold my interest and keep me occupied. I'm definitely looking forward to more rooms
B00364K6YW|5.0|I really love this series.  I watched it three times within the first week of owning it.  The roles are very well cast with likeable actors and it follows the novel very well.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great app. I downloaded it last night and can`t stop playing the game. I highly recommend this game. A lot of variations.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I initially started the series on tv, but had conflicts with other programming so I only watched a few episodes and considered reading the books instead.  Then they renewed for a fifth season before season four even began, so I immediately bought seasons 1 and 2 (season 3 wasn't out yet).  I'm hooked so far.  I just hope they manage to keep it mysterious and interesting without being too repetitive.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Awesome movie lots of action. It is a must see and it's great being able to stream when ever I am in the mood to watch the movie
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I initially started the series on tv, but my husband didn't think it would &#34;make it&#34; and it was against another program so I only watched a few episodes.  Well, after they renewed for a fifth season before season four even began, I knew had some catching up to do.<br /><br />I love the cast, not just the girls but the adults too.  And my &#34;inner teenager&#34; loves the hairstyle and fashion ideas I get from the show. :)
B000W8HC8I|3.0|This book was ok.  I read it for a book club, and I'm sure it will be interesting to discuss, but it wasn't great, just ok.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Was great to finally know what went down...under...really you can't go wrong with Jo Nesbo! Harry Hole is an amazing character.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Lana really want to know and recnis things and learn about their world they love it helps so much you l love it when you see it your easy will light up you won't believe it
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|GREAT TIME MANAGEMENT GAME! I WISH THEY WOULD COME OUT WITH MORE LEVELS  LOTS OF FUN!  I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Cool looking games.  Not bad real fun. Good graphics with cool little dragons. Real cool not stupid the more levels the more fun it is
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This is a great app for anyone desiring to play stored DVDs on their TV. I placed all m my DVDs onto my computer. It's a great way to go.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I really loved watching this film.  A little stiff on the script, but all around great, likely b/c it is true.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King has done it again. I love his writing and this book was terrific. I couldn't put it down.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The first film was ground-breaking in that it was sci-fi that ased some great questions, made you think about who and what we are. We left the first film with our mouths open because of the concept introduced in the first film.<br />!<br />The second film had one sequence that matched the original's promise and that was a single conversation that broke down all that was going on while teasing you with more possibilities and deeper ideas. Other than that, it is almost a waste of time until the cliffhanger ending.<br />!<br />The third film is a real mess. Very few great moments with an ending that made too many sacrifices. It was a HUGE letdown because there was no big final reveal or twist. It was just action without something to make you think it was all worth the journey.<br />!<br />Now as satisfying a series as the first one promised. But at this price, it is still worth a buy!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|this game is agood game when you have nothing to do, or when you have spare time. ilove this game.
B00A0SMTXS|5.0|Solid film with strong acting and great special effects! No way you won't like this movie!! Get some popcorn and enjoy!!<br />!<br />Romantic, humanistic worldview with no positive Christian values whatsoever.
0802473156|5.0|It's a lot of good stuff in this book. Most of it is common sense, but it opens up the door for healthy conversation. It's a great book for couples to read, internalize, and apply.
B009GEAWOU|4.0|Well-written and very well acted. You love the characters after you get to know them. Be advised...this show has NO redeeming value. The characters are sinners who enjoy sinning and leading others to sin. You WILL laugh at this show, but understand that it is no good for you.<br />!<br />Romantic, humanistic worldview with no positive Christian values whatsoever.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was confusing at first but once you figure out what you have to do it is a very addicting game.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Best of the Marvel offering so far!! After seeing Man of Steel, Marvel will have to step up its game in the next one.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A great read with a different type of story telling then usual. Just as good but completely different than the movie
B004EPYZUI|3.0|This film is impossible to describe...requires a lot of attention to see where you are in the subplots...doesn't end in a way that will satisfy most viewers. Good to look at though!!
B000P0J09W|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter.  She has watched it like six or eight times.  I also bought her Harry Potter and even tho she has other Harry Potter movies and really likes them she has yet to watch it because she like watching this one so much.
B005LF9AOQ|5.0|Well-written and very well acted. You love the characters after you get to know them. Be advised...this show has NO redeeming value. The characters are sinners who enjoy sinning and leading others to sin. You WILL laugh at this show, but understand that it is no good for you.<br />!<br />Romantic, humanistic worldview with no positive Christian values whatsoever.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Enjoyed the storyline and EVERYTHING else!!!  Can't wait for more of this story to come out.  Really really enjoyed it!
1451626096|3.0|I received this book today in the mail. While the packaging was fine, the book itself is not in great condition. The long salvage edge of the book is not trimmed like the top and bottom of pages are. It looks terrible. I always donate the books I purchase from Amazon and read, to the School Library that I work at. This book looks like it's been thru the mill (or actually since the page edges were not properly trimmed, guess it did not 'go thru the mill!').<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading it, however, but was disappointed in the book's quality of finish.<br /><br />Paula Morris
B005544TRQ|5.0|Couldn't wait to see what would happen next! A must watch that is worth watching. Thank you Amazon Prime for airing this series.
B005NFWCSK|4.0|The character development, internal conflicts, and actor performances, were strong, at least through the better part of the movie. Things sort of fell apart towards the end. The clever drama devolved into action shlock. Being a movie about comic book characters, the action was expected. But the action scenes earlier in the movie were handled so well, it was almost as if they were perfectly natural. For most of the movie, disbelief was completely suspended due to deft handling of the fictitious subject matter, and how it tied in with real world events in such a way as to make a believable tapestry. I wish the 'big finale' was handled as well. It would have been a five star rating!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent.  This book is not just a story about Afghanistan.  It is a story about people's interacting together and making hard choices.  It is a story about families and the ultimate truth that life is not always fair and that we all chose how to play the hand that we are dealt.
B007VTUYWW|3.0|It's an OK film, but it didn't hold my interest. It's too bad, as I really WANTED to love this movie.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|For a French film to make it a small town theater in Bedford New York should really say it all.... Amazing story, fantastic acting, beautiful music....
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Help! on Blu-Ray is an absolute joy. Seeing the Fab Four in brilliant color, in Hi-Def with a remastered song track is a feast for your eyes and ears. Not the greatest plot but hey, it's THE BEATLES.  What else does one need.  Buy it and love it. We will never see anyone like them again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author definitely has a grasp for sharing cultural differences and character portrayal clearly.  Not to be compared with The Kite Runner but very enjoyable reading.  The reader will be given some concepts to explore that gives rise to thoughtful introspection.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I've been meaning to see this movie for a while since Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress for the role, but I've put it off because I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies.  I'm pleased to say that the movie exceeded my expectations in every way.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is a great actor who is beyond fantastic in this role and clearly deserved the Oscar.  She makes the movie sing.  Bradley Cooper is also amazing in his portrayal of a likable but flawed guy with bipolar disorder.  The rest of the cast, particularly Robert Denero, are well suited for their supporting roles.<br /><br />I confess I got more than a little choked up at the end.<br /><br />Despite being in a genre I'm not particularly fond of, I liked this movie so much, I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|This is one of those things you buy into because you want to support a good artist and you want to believe the hype. I've been enjoying Cole since, about '07 and he makes some really good music. This just isn't his best, or even close. It's not that I hate it, or that I'm having one of those &#34;he was better before he was famous&#34; moments, it just isn't as good as you would expect it to be. The lyrical content is, well it's just not all that impressive. I was hoping for an album with a message; and while there are glimpses of a good messages throughout this, there's quite a bit of contradiction too.<br />With that being said, lyrical content isn't what everyone is looking for, so how about the beats? There's a couple good ones. As a whole though, this isn't an album that's fun to bump all the way through. You definitely have to pick and chose the songs here, (and skip all of the bonus material, it does nothing for the album).<br /><br />It's a playable album, it's not trash by any means, but its just not great. There's nothing memorable here, next year I won't want to play this at all-- which is a shame because I've had some of Cole's mix-tapes on rotation for almost 6 years now.
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|goes in depth on all aspects when dealing with the CSS3 - will guide you on what is new in CSS3 and has practical knowledge
B000X2H8G4|4.0|product works very well helps my elderly cousin hear better at prayer services. Now she doesn't have to sit right up under the speaker.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series.  I can hardly wait until Season 4 comes on PBS.  I was very saddened at the end of Season 3 with a very unexpected death.  It keeps us guessing as to what will happen next.  Great British soap opera; wonderful actors.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really nice graphics, a good story, fun distraction for a quick break from work.  The best that I have tried.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but as most movies, it doesn't live up to the book. It was fun and if I hadn't read the book first, I would have loved it.
B003GYEGNO|5.0|I liked how Tom Wolfe really got into the minds of the main characters.  It explained the reasons for their actions and reactions.  The topic is very relevant in today's society.
B00DFFHUUA|3.0|If you like ninjas doing just about everything, this is your film. Ninjas fighting ninjas. Check. Ninjas shooting and chopping things. Check. Special guest stars Bruce Willis and Cobra Commander make an appearance or two. Oh and RZA from Wu Tang Clan who's on a roll with the martial arts flicks. The Rock was the lead in this film until the ninjas started doing their thing. Overall three stars for all the ninja action, but this film wasnt as good as the first film where there was more story balance.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A story of sacrifice, love, pain and joy. This book though seemingly for Young Adults is as entertaining for adults. The author uses language and metaphors that leave you captivated. The characters come alive so effortlessly with John Green that you can nearly touch and feel them like in a movie.<br />Though the book is beautiful the plot is a love story between two cancer patients and book leaves you with an immense sadness and fear of the disease.
0440246318|5.0|I hope Lee Child keeps writing the Jack Reacher series. I don't know what I'd do without Jack Reacher! Excellent books from start to finish. Great entertaining reading. One of the few series that I just can't put down. Do yourself a favor and, if you haven't read the series yet, order all the books and start reading!!! Enjoy!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Exellent book! If you liked Khaled's first two books you won't be disappointed - you'll love this one as well.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Sawyer, John, Kate, Jack...,BEN...great characters, great writing and you can't resist Sawyer's one-liners. It's addicting and a great way to spend time during the off season of network shows.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I been following Rush from ever so I think this is a great album from the latest recordings of a great band
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I'm not near as intelligent as a scientist and I was able to enjoy and digest this book. Very enlightening.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The game is great for kids that like horses it us hard to leave the game IThe game is cute with Good graphics
B00CDUVDEC|4.0|Fast paced, heavy, and undeniably brutal. This album is, to me, is a compilation of all the pent up rage Phil has had to deal with over the last decade. These songs would have never fit in with Down or Superjoint Ritual; so I can see why he had to fly solo on this one. The music is powerful and overall I enjoyed the album. However since my first initial listens it is defiantly an album I  will listen to only while working out or if I need something to vent to. The mixing does get very messy in a few places and the album is quite short.  This is a solid first effort from Phil, but I hope we can experience a more polished release in the future.
1936608898|5.0|I have ordered 6 of these books at different times and everyone is working on a new way of life.  Thank you...
B00BCX2F66|5.0|Very nice product. Didn't purchase the replacement warranty for the HTC One, so I wanted a simple cover to protect it from abrasion not a armored case. Glad I found this!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup is very quick and painless, you plug it into your tv and power it by usb, you turn your tv to the hdmi it's plugged into, then you use your laptop/phone to set it up, it tells you exactly what to do. took literally 2 minutes because of internet being slow...haha<br />Highly recommend!<br />ALSO, mine shipped in less than 16 hours...thanks AMAZON!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|We recently downloaded the free TripAdvisor app in preparation for a trip to Florida.  It was easy to use, and most helpful in locating good restaurants near our hotel.  Highly recommended!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a game changer. I haven't been captivated by a book like this for quite awhile. An eye opener to the world around us, this book really makes you think. A must read for all ages.
B0012UNWJ8|5.0|I saw this movie years ago, and, though I don't play chess, this one really stuck with me. watch it for yourself.
1452126607|5.0|Good quality material. Every month features a new Grumpy Cat image. What’s not to love? I hope they make a Grumpy Cat pocket planner.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Thought the first \\"Expendable\\" was good but this one was just as good.. Hope there is a third one in the near future.
1452126577|3.0|I am a huge Tartar Sauce/Grumpy Cat fan so naturally I had to have this book. It is basically a compilation of Grumpy Cat memes that you see all over the internet with a few basic activities such as cross word puzzles and connect the dots. The book also features a couple images of Pokey, Dog and Cactus. If I would have had the opportunity to flip through the book at a book store, I would not have purchased the book simply for the lack of diversity in the images. There are tons of images out there of Grumpy Cat, but this book features the same two on every other page, but with a different caption. I was hoping for a more diverse collection of images.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I thought the actor/actress were great it was like you lived and belonged in that era.<br />I enjoyed it so much I was in search of other English period movies. Chose the Tudors for my next veiwing<br />Sherell
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I chose this rating because this story never gets old. Time and time again this story is read to my little ones, and each encounter is sure to be full of giggles and laughter. They love to turn the pages and see what our loveable monster friend has to say. Overall, this book deserves all the stars it has been given because it gives my family and I quality time together, which can't be measured in stars. This book is always recommended.
0446576220|5.0|Can't wait to shake things up. This read gave me permission to implement things that may push the envelope but make so much sense.
B009E20IB6|4.0|As much as those stories follows his writting standard, I really prefer a whole book-size story. Not sure if I'll read the other short stories, but I'll keep reading the other books.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|This is my favorite series. I can't wait for the latest installment of my favorite story. The action and special effects are exemplary.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game to tease your brain. My family had a good time playing this game together. Well worth your time to download and play. Cannot wait for the new rooms to come online.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I receive updates from third party hosts, but other than that, I adore this app and will always use it.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Not bad. A little cheesy. Some unexpected twists and turns. I watched a second time on cable and still was catching some things I missed the first time.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I believe any electronic device should have some sort of cleaner on it. I use ccleaner on my computers, and this is a great little app, to clean up your system. It frees up space and gets rid of unnecessary clutter. This ia a must have.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I just love playing this game.  From the start it is exciting and a real challenge. I am hooked!!!  I have tried each time to beat my last score.
B009ME47H2|5.0|This works great, being a parent and being nosy and wanting to know what is going on. I have turned this on, when I have left a room......then I know what the kids are saying, planning and doing. I know.................. I am sneaky........but they haven't figured out how I know things, they were being secretive about.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I loved it!<br />This book is to the point and offers alternative answers and solutions to questions and matters one may be taken for granted or as already given. I hardly write reviews... I just couldn't resist giving an opinion on this one!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love, love, love this show.  It's addicting.  I wouldn't recommend watching it too close to bedtime as I have stayed up way too late on more than 1 occasion.
B008602KQI|4.0|great movie you should watch this movie it is one of the movies you can choose to watch from amazon
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I was very impressed with this film. I enjoyed the ethereal nature of the movie and was especially impressed by the acting prowess of the main characters and their ability to seamlessly portray multiple characters throughout the story. Anyone looking for an out-of-this-world, intelligent, and emotional journey should look into this one!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I think that I am addicted to it. I would recommend it to all of my FRIENDS! and even strangers!! lol
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After I saw the movie, I wanted to read the books. The movie follows the book quite closely but as always, there are more details in the books than the movie. It also explains a few things better than it does in the movie. I couldn't put it down.
6305278016|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in YEARS! My son gave me the idea to look it up on Amazon. I found it, ordered it and it arrived in just a few days! What wonderful service! Thanks!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an awesome book.  It is hard to describe why exactly I enjoyed it so much, because it is a very unusual book.  The basic premise is that humanity has encountered an alien species and has just barely driven them away.  In order to ensure future victory, the military begins to recruit and train children from a very young age in order to shape them into battle commanders.  The book follows a boy named Ender, who has the potential to become one of the greatest military commanders ever.  However, as you can imagine, the journey is not an easy one.  The book is a discourse on the use of people as tools.  It is very interesting and I highly recommend it, regardless of how old you are.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I really don't like this game because they have a lot of dumb cars but I do like the truck they have in this game the diesel truck
B0041KW076|5.0|Great album, no scratches to the vinyl, plays great. Adding this to my collection of Beatles albums. I should be complete within a matter of months.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I have read many Neil Gaiman books and this one certainly measures up to the rest.  This reminded me of the Graveyard Book but maybe a bit grittier and with a touch of sex.  I love the Hempstock's and their conjuring.  Miss Monkton is a truly creative monster, and the fact that the story is told from a memory that will disappear as soon as &#34;the ocean&#34; is left behind gives it a poignance ending.  Can't wait for the next!
B0041KVV8U|5.0|Great album, no scratches on the vinyl, plays great. Another notch in my Beatles Vinyl collecting belt. Almost there! Woot!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Who knew physics could be so much fun?  When I solve a difficult one and get the max stars, I am so proud of myself!
B001IWV030|5.0|One could loosely call this the (1976) predecessor to the (1985) &#34;whodunnit?&#34; film Clue, but each can stand on their own merits and you won't spend your time which is better as they are both great.
B003BLPTB0|1.0|Size 13M Yukons have a velcro strap that is too short to hold a size 13 foot in the shoe... older models had plenty of strap.
B00004WPAE|5.0|Great album, no scratches on the vinyl, plays great. Who doesn't love the Beatles? Oh, well then you shouldn't be reading this.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Super!  So glad I found them.  Versatile.  Creative. Highly recommend!  Look out though--could be addictive:-)  Catchy.  Upper.  Good positive vibes.
0679805273|5.0|I read the book aloud to a graduating class all of whom were getting their GED. The kids and the parents loved it.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Completely love this series. I was taken back on how well they did this series. Definetly looking forward to seeing more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We have become great Downton Abbey fans. It is such a different world from what we normally experience. Cannot wait for Season 4.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|I am so hooked on this series, it's ridiculous. Seeing Julianna play the role of a strong mother and lawyer is so different from her original role in ER. I really think this is a better fit for her persona. Recommended highly to anyone.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Although some dramatic license has been taken with the full truth of this event, it is close enough to be considered accurate. And gripping. The emotional strength of the film is a bit cautious, by which I mean personal relationships and political significance both then and now.
B0025DDLHO|4.0|My son loves the brio metro train, so I got this for the extra people, bench, and extra cars. All of the pieces except the track are good quality. This is the first &#34;name-brand&#34; track I purchased, and it was surprisingly rough.
B00C3UUZVE|3.0|I like the idea and how easy it is to use....I just cannot rate it higher because after the first few times it seems to be too repetitive.  I guess I got spoiled with the Dr. Panda dollhouse app which is more creative.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can you escape is a fun game to play with friends and family. that is why i like this game<br />[[ASIN:B009USAJCC Anker® Astro3E 10000mAh High Capacity Power Bank Pack Portable External Battery Charger for iPhone 5, 4S, 4, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods (Lightning adapter not included); Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 2; HTC One, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA;...]]]
0240815807|4.0|As a digital media creation company, we have recently focused on elevating the quality of our Pro Tools room to make sure we deliver quality, reliable mixes.  Mike Senior's 'Mixing Secrets' was exactly what we were looking for.  His deep knowledge and sweeping coverage of ALL components of the audio production chain is impressive.  His book is thorough and written in a no nonsense way so that you can focus on what matters as you go.  We have implemented a handful of tweaks and will continue to guide our improvements based on his writing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely engrossing series that you won't be able to stop watching and will long for the next session!  Acting and storyline are top notch!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|i liked this book much better than his second . kite runner was great. the characters in atmr are so human. i felt empathy for each and every one of them. waiting for the next book.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|If you've enjoyed books 1-3 you'll enjoy this one too. Although, I must note that this book does not continue the Dani, Jon Snow, or Stannis/Davos story lines.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is addicting. My kids love this. Its even easy for my 6 yr old to play the beginning levels. Great way to pass the time.
B000MR1V22|5.0|Funny, intelligent and great acting. Little Miiss Sunshine is a real gem with a  wry take on  a dysfinctional family, the world of child  breauty competitions  , teenage angst and  well-meaning but flawed characters. Just like the rest of us!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Everything with this app use requires the need for additional purchase.  You will rack up cost fast with this game. It is not worth the money you will have to put into it to fully use the game. Don't waste your time or money.
0062059963|3.0|I don't know why this book is being marketed as a dystopian novel. It's not. It's a romance, plain a simple. The dystopian aspect is so tiny in regards to plot. So very, very small. Which is a shame, because I was really hoping The Elite would touch on it more than The Selection did. I find the rebels to be extremely appealing and want to know more about it/have more interaction with them. Maybe then, the \\"dystopian\\" label wouldn't bug me so much.<br /><br />As for the romance... I was already annoyed by page 8 when America asked both Maxon and Aspen for \\"time.\\" It didn't stop there either. She spent a majority of the novel going back and forth between the two. Maxon pissed her off, so Aspen was the love of her life. Aspen pissed her off, so Maxon was the love of her life. *sigh* America herself was also prone to temper tantrums. If she didn't get her way she would act extremely immature and do things because she was feeling petty and wronged. This isn't the America from The Selection. That America did things because they needed to be done and they were the right things to say/do. The Elite America is a shadow of this America and it's sad. Remember how much America mentioned her family during The Selection? Not so much here. Mere lines.<br /><br />One of my biggest issues is when America saw the reprecutions of what happened if you \\"hooked up\\" with somebody while being a part of the Selection. What is her response (aside from being horrified)? She still sneaks around with Aspen. Not. Kidding. She's devastated by what happened to this girl but still risks everything - literally - to hang out with him in secret. On top of that, Aspen still plays a relatively minor role in The Elite. He pops up every now and then, and I know he's a point in our triangle but I'm not seeing the attraction to him. Usually in a love triangle I see enough of both guys to understand, but not here. Probably one of the reasons I'm so Team Maxon. My heart can at least be tugged into the direction of the other guy, but I don't care for Aspen... not even a little bit. This plot element seems almost like a crutch rather than a significant aspect of the story. Something to help fill in plot where it's needed, but not really helping to move it along.<br /><br />To give America credit, one of the reasons she's struggling with fully committing to Maxon is she's terrified of the responsibility of becoming princess, then queen. I don't blame her. I'd be scared, too. I don't think this gives her a pass to flit between Apsen and Maxon, but I completely understand this. And, can I say that her father is awesome? When she writes to him her fears and he writes back, aww! He is so supportive and one of the best dad's I've come across in YA. Shame we don't hear more of him...<br /><br />Despite all these things, I did enjoy the book. I want to continue with The One when it comes out. I want to see how this trilogy ends. I want America to tell Aspen \\"Sorry, buddy\\" and end up with Maxon. They're weirdly perfect for each other and together I think they could really turn Illea around. I want The One to focus a little less on relationship drama and the rebels. I want to find out what the Northerners are looking for - because Maxon is right on that point - and why the Southerners are so angry - other than the obvious.on of the other guy, but I don't care for Aspen... not even a little bit.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I think this is the best app i ever downloaded, i have tons of stuff of my kindle but millions of stuff in my cloud, i needed to clear some of the stuff on my kindle out, i always download the free app of the day, but sometimes i don't have enough space for so i try to uninstall apps but that takes too long so sometimes i give up because i get very lazy, but this app lets you uninstall multiple apps at the same time, which is a lot faster than plugging your kindle into a computer and messing with the files, it also lets you clear the catch, force stop apps, the best feature is to delete empty folders, this is the best cleaning app you could ever download, the only problem i have is updating it, i go to the menu and click update, it scans for the latest update and when it finds one i tell it to update, it downloads the files and i am prompted to replace the app, i click yes or confirm or whatever it was, and then it says it failed. So if anybody could please tell me what I'm doing wrong or how to do it properly that would be really helpful, otherwise this app has no other bug or holes that i found, so go a push that download button!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|one of the best games I have played in a while.  made it through first ten rooms need to keep them coming!!!
0439023513|5.0|I've read all of these books 3 times.  I came late to the series so I was able to read the series straight through the first time.  I wanted to start over again immediately but talked myself out of it.  But the second time I read them, I started over again right away.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|I followed it up from &#34;The Collectors&#34;,found the story flowed into &#34;Stone Cold&#34; reasonable well.Left me wondering if<br />Oliver Stone or&#34;John Carr&#34;will ever resurface???

B002N9MK8G|4.0|The heading says it all. The singing and music were masterful, but the dialog was distracting and detracting from the overall impression.
B003K16P50|3.0|I loved the movie and it's messages of love, hope, and the things that as humans we all have in common.  I was so disappointed to find those themes missing from the book and the cynicism that ran through it instead.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Past the half way mark ... and I'm digging it. Great to put all the rumors and stories of the tech world in context and get a closer glimpse of the entire scene of the tech revolution. Very well written and very entertaining..
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My son recommended this show.  He was right on, it's a good family show and very funny.  I highly recommend it.
B00BIR381W|5.0|Being a big fan of PLL it is a must have so I can always watch whenever I want to look back to my favorite PLL moment
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Written as a memoir, the is narrated by a man returning to a farmhouse down the street from his childhood home. It follows two timelines; the frame story of the man skipping out on a funeral and his fuzzy recollections of a magical time. It's a quick read and Gaiman's usual &#34;adult themes&#34; aren't really present, other than a brief passage through the unfocused lens of a prepubescent boy.<br /><br />I read it in less than a day while on vacation in Scotland. Definitely worth it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of the few games I've ever gotten, since I rarely play games. This one is different. Makes my 3 hour commute so much more tolerable.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The voice acting for both the Japanese and English soundtracks are quite well done. The story is fantastic. This is exactly the type of quality I expect from Studio Ghibli.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My husband says I'm like an old lady because I play it everyday. I wish there was a way to convert money to chips, though.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Watched this movie as a young adult and loved it so needed to buy it when I saw it was available on DVD.  Music and story were attention holding.
0345803485|5.0|After reading Fifty Shades of Grey I realized that I was mistaken.  This book isn't supposed to be read as a serious piece of dramatic literature.  This book is the first in what I will dub \\"Surreal Pornography\\".  The prose was purposefully bad, the plot was purposefully weak, and the characters were supposed to be two dimensional versions of the cast of the first Twilight novel.  It was all made this way to frame what the author was really focusing on: Christian Grey's magical size morphing penis.  Sometimes the man has a normal sized penis, sometimes its several feet long.  It is the only way he could do some of the incredible feats of sexual activity that him and Anna engage in.<br /><br />The ending is another sign of its Surrealism.  After hundreds of pages of Christian Grey telling Anna that he has never felt so complete, whole, happy, fulfilled, and so on and so forth before he met her, she leaves him because he can't say \\"I love you\\". Well done Anna!<br /><br />Five stars for the funniest book I have read in quite some time, but I will not be reading the rest.  Too much of a good thing.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|This movie has absolutely nothing going for it. Probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Horribly written. Horrible acting. Horrible story.<br /><br />I read an article before I went that said it was better than all 3 Ocean's. WTF?!?! whoever wrote that either never saw the Ocean movies or just wanted their quote publicized. Now You See Me is so corny and just freaking dumb. I felt insulted that a filmmaker would think I'd be entertained by it. Maybe it would entertain 13 year olds. Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT waste your money on this. The twist at the end is so stupid and easily determined. I could tell you the ending and \\"ruin\\" it for you but there is nothing to ruin!!!!<br /><br />Good Day,<br />Evan Pope

B00821PCJS|4.0|Very good show; enjoying the story in season 1 so far.  Interested in seeing where it goes in the future.
0316044695|4.0|An interesting read on the war in Afghanistan and the mission of the Navy Seals.<br />The training of the Seals could have been more condensed. Also there seemed to be a lot of repetition in some places.
B008IEWBJ8|5.0|Exceptional; has become one of the most frequently played pieces of music in our entire collection!  Highly recommended; my wife uses it both to relax as well as motivation.
B003TXSF5C|5.0|The GRAND DESIGN is the appropriate title for this review as it is inclusive of a virtual catalog of the totality of human observations, explanations and the search for truth by the scientific method throughout human history. The authors describe “how regularities in the motion of astronomical bodies such as the sun, the moon, and the planets suggested that they were governed by fixed laws rather than being subject to the arbitrary whims and caprices of gods and demons. At first the existence of such laws became apparent only in astronomy (or astrology, which was regarded as much the same). The behavior of things on earth is so complicated and subject to so many influences that early civilizations were unable to discern any clear patterns or laws governing these phenomena. Gradually, however, new laws were discovered in areas other than astronomy, and this led to the idea of scientific determinism: There must be a complete set of laws that, given the state of the universe at a specific time, would specify how the universe would develop from that time forward. These laws should hold everywhere and at all times; otherwise they wouldn’t be laws.”<br /><br />Although this book is excellent in its design and execution, one would need to have been through the material of introduction course material of college mathematics, chemistry and physics.<br /><br />I have read and listened to the book twice.  I bought both the Audible and Kindle editions.  There were complex areas which my understanding was improved by simultaneously reading and listening to the material.  I highly recommend this.

B00CATSONE|5.0|I learned far more from this book than I have in all other writings about Nikola Tesla. One thing this book illustrates quite well is how Nikola Tesla tried to leave this world a much better place than he found it despite endless turmoils and slander by JP Morgan and Thomas Edison. Many people don't realize that Nikola Tesla would've been the world's first billionaire, but instead he ripped up the royalty contracts to save the man who believed in him from being bankrupted by JP Morgan. He truly invented for the betterment of humanity. It would be interesting to see what his papers detailed that the US Government confiscated and classified as top secret when he died.

140006922X|1.0|From the book, \\"The bedrock of evangelical Christianity, at least as it was taught to me, is the unconditional belief that every word of the Bible is God-breathed and true, literal and inerrant.The sudden realization that this belief is patently and irrefutably false, that the Bible is replete with the most blatant and obvious errors and contradictions- just as one would expect from a document written by hundreds of hands across thousands of years\\"<br /><br />See here: [[ASIN:140006922X Zealot Life Times Jesus Nazareth]]<br /><br />The Bible is the Word of God.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this simple little device. Really what I wanted was a cheap solution to stream google play music all access through my receiver and have the ability to control with my phone. ( was thinking about getting one of those Android micro computer dongles for $50- $100) I have the Chromecast hooked into the back of my Onkyo TX-NR509 receiver.<br /><br />The receiver is networked and has the ability to play pandora and Spotify ( and couple others services) but the Onkyo phone app works half of the time and I don't have a Spotify account. The interface was pretty crappy as well. The Chromecast fixes this and makes playing my music simple and seamless. I use my Galaxy note 2 mostly with the Chromecast although I have used my wife's iPad, her iPhone 4, and even an old iPhone 3GS has worked streaming youtube. I can also use my Macbook pro to stream from the Chrome browser. I have not had any issues using the chrome browser to stream. One thing I noticed on moonlight media is that the lip sync was not spot on but that was because of the site. When I used ABC to stream Modern Family everything was spot on with lip sync. My wife and I had fun streaming videos of our daughter from youtube onto our Plasma. It is also cool if you see something you like on youtube you can just cast straight to the TV without any effort really. The nexflix interface is pretty sweet. Better than the Roku or Xbox 360 I have.<br /><br />When you hook up your Chromecast to a receiver make sure that everything is turned off so you don't get any HDMI handshake issues.  One of the benefits of hooking up to your receiver is you can turn your TV off and listen to your music without having the TV on. When you are watching TV it still works to change inputs to Chromecast when casting but you can't change back to the original source without your remote ( not yet anyways, would be a cool feature but oh well).<br /><br />New apps I would like to see are:<br /><br />-Google + integration so you can sling pictures and videos to the TV ( Seems like this is a no brainer) Even if they (Google) don't want to you to be able to send local files to the TV a good compromise would be using google + to do this.<br /><br />- HBO GO<br /><br />- Facebook integration could be cool as well. One thing cool already is that if someone shares a Facebook link to a youtube video you can just sling it right to the TV to watch instead of your phone or computer.<br /><br />- Vine or Instagram integration would also be sweet.<br /><br />- maybe a game could be developed where multiple people could use their phone to play on one TV for when you have people over.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Outstanding book that really furthers an understanding of Jesus in his own times.  Writing a book about the life and times of Jesus is very difficult because so little real evidence exists outside of religious works that were written long after his death.  The author, however, puts Jesus as the Messiah into a rich context of what was going on in  Judea and Galilee in those times.  This leads to a much richer appreciation of how Jesus must have seen himself as a teacher and rebel against Roman authority, and also of what the religious expectations and understanding of the times were.  It puts the biblical writings into a clearer perspective.  Highly recommended and very thought provoking.
B000NJXG6S|5.0|I loved the OC so naturally I had to get the set. This set includes the entire series, but it is not the big bulky book that is more detailed and extravagant (although the book is nice! My friend has it.) This set is also more affordable. My only issue with this package is that the amazon carton box it came in was not securely sealed. It was falling apart by the time I received it. I'm surprised the DVDs inside were ok. But other than that- it was a great purchase & I highly recommend!
B001NHNG64|3.0|I read my first Lee Child novel, The Killing Floor, and was disappointed at the implausible story lines and multiple holes. I decided to give him another try since that was his first book and reviews for Die Trying were favorable. Although the story lines were much more imaginative, there are just too many holes and implausible elements. The continued loose ends are too distracting to warrant another try.

B006ISJQ26|2.0|What a shame.  This could have been a good movie.  Keira and Colin do a great job on what they had, there are a lot of actors that you will recognize as well and they play their parts well too.  A weak story line, and just too much profanity.  I understand the developing of the \\"mood\\" with the language used, but it was over the top for me.<br /><br />You might want to rent this one before you buy.

034580709X|3.0|The Bat--Jo Nesbo<br />The publisher has re-released this book by Nesbo which was originally published in 1997. This is the first book in a hugely successful series of eight (thus far) using the central character of Harry Hole, an Oslo police investigator.<br />Oddly enough although the central character and the book's author are Norwegian, the entirety of the story takes place in Australia. Police investigator Hole is sent to Sydney to help solve the murder of a Norwegian woman who had been somewhat of a celebrity.<br />Of course, he spends a lot of his time working with the Australian police, but he also deals with many characters who are not basic white hat good guys and black hat bad guys but many shadings of \\"gray.\\" The cast of people makes for an intriguing story line. Hole himself is a person with many faults and issues but ultimately he is the hero of the tale.<br />The novel has many exciting and interesting points but has some dull, slow sections as well. The build-up to the ending is exciting and keeps the reader rapidly turning pages to see what's next, but ultimately I thought the ending was a bit over the top. However, if you have read any other Nesbo books, you will enjoy this one and if you have never read his books, this is a good place to start.

I'd love to be able to choose hardware brands, form factors, and user interfaces of my choice to work on or enjoy my preferred software without proprietary borders. Well, the tech R & D and business landscape as a whole is not there yet, but Splashtop is a nice way to dream about it until the day arrives. Using this app on my tab and the companion software for my desk computer, I stretch the limits of my portable device by using traditionally desktop-only apps, watch flash-based vids on the open web, and all kinds of awesome stuff.

B009WUBERW|3.0|Old guys way past their prime are in it for a few good laughs, over the top acting, and lots of mayhem. All the bad guys can't shoot a side of a barn (a HUGE barn at that) and meet inglorious and bloody ends (it is very violent).  What little there are of serious moments is totally contrived and banal. The real fun is watching Rocky, Terminator, and other old geezers trying to emote while their surgically butchered faces try to stretch enough to provide any sense of movement. The plastic surgery on these guys have rendered their face UNexpandable! Crank up the volume for the loud explosions, grab a cold brew and a bag of popcorns and waste an afternoon or an evening.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I played Chimpact on another platform long before I purchased* this gorgeous and challenging game for my android tablet, and have enjoyed it from Day 1. Unfortunately for me, so many titles are not account-based and shareable per an individual's buying across microcomputing ecosystem lines, and for now at least, I'm a much too practical monkey to buy everything twice or 3 times. If I buy a bunch of bananas, there's just no way they'll only be eaten at my desk while I buy 2 more bunches for work and errand-running snacks. *Thanks to the free app a day program at Amazon, I'm bananas at home and abroad! Good game. Peace and love.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Captivating and magical would be the two words that most come to mind when I think of Neil Gaiman's writing and this work embodies both.<br /><br />Told as a flashback to the protagonist's childhood, the story centers around some very unusual neighbors he meets as a young boy. Short and sweet, the book is a breezy read. I finished it in only a few days and I'm not a particularly fast reader.<br /><br />While not his best work, for me it fell short of his best titles, including Neverwhere, American Gods and Stardust, I was nonetheless intrigued by the plot and pleased with each turn of the page. At its conclusion, I was left wanting more, not from dis-satisfaction but because the book itself is quite short. I'm hoping we see more novels from Neil in the near future, he is certainly one of the most talented writers in the genre.

B00D6BQPMM|3.0|We sort of knew what to expect with this movie. We both guessed that the outcome was positive which was why we rented it in the first place. The main characters did a good job in getting together in building up the love felt between each other and trying to get the word out to the other sides. All in all I don't think that I would buy it simply because there was a lot of other things that needed to be done prior and it just sort of got long and winded in the process.

1451626088|5.0|I've long been a fan of Philippa Gregory's fiction based on the Royal families of England, and this latest instalment in her Cousins' War series didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter tells the story of Anne Neville, a real life historical figure who played a vital role in various conflicting plots during the War of the Roses, rising from a dead traitor's daughter to Queen Consort of England.<br /><br />The thing I love about Gregory's books is that she can take several parallel stories, such as those from her previous books The White Queen and The Red Queen, and make them each interesting.  She can take a character who is described as boring by her contemporaries and make her exciting.  She can take someone who was viewed as a villain and turn her into a hero.  And she can take her beautiful, sympathetic heroine from her first book, Elizabeth Woodville, and turn her into a villain herself through Anne's eyes.<br /><br />Gregory kept me riveted through every moment of Anne's story, which was quite a feat, since I already knew the outcomes from studying history as well as reading the concurrent novels.  Even though anyone with wikipedia can find out the book's ending, still the Kingmaker's Daughter manages to pull the reader along, weaving a subtle suspense and an intimate picture of life in the midst of this tumultuous period.  Well done!  I'm very much looking forward to the next book in this series, the recently released The White Princess.

B0087ZG7UW|5.0|My mistake was underestimating Psycho.<br /><br />But it's really quite an easy mistake to make. After all, when was the last time a black-and-white movie really scared you? I mean, when did one leaving you in that state you were after you saw The Shining or Evil Dead? Nosferatu was considered terrifying for it's day, but if you showed it to teens now, how would they react to the sight of the Vampyre's hand crawling up the wall? The brilliant Hammer Horror films Frankenstein, The Mummy, and Dracula are scary in their own right, but have their own brand of black humour that prevents the film from feeling like 100% horror.<br /><br />Yeah, well, guess what. Psycho is scary. Really scary.<br /><br />Scary and damn effective. Hitchcock uses every trick in his twisted book to pull the rug out from under you. The twist ending, now famous, is still completely shocking and disturbing, even to someone (like me) who knew it beforehand.<br />Even to someone like me, a guy who thought he knew what he was in for, the film terrifies, disturbs, and haunts long after you see...OH GOD THE HORROR HE'S TURNING INTO A SKULL MAKE IT STOP! THE EYES OH THE EYES!<br /><br />Yeah, that was kind of my internal monologue at that scene. I surprised even myself as I saw the film. At times I was talking to the characters (\\"NO! Keep driving! Don't pull into the Bates Motel! N-N-Ohhh! You're toast!\\"). I know I sound like a fool, and I probably looked like a fool, but that is merely a testament to the fine acting and peerless Hitchcockian Hitchcockiness.<br /><br />What of the infamous shower scene? Does it deserve it's peerless praise? I have to admit, I saw the scene on YouTube before I saw Psycho and I was less than impressed. More fool me. A scene seen out of context is like reading one page in a book. The praise is justly deserved, and more. The scene, while only lasting over 2 minutes in length, is perhaps the single most famous, studied, parodied, and re-watched scene in cinematic history. It packs a brutal punch and has the guts to go right for the throat. You can dissect it a million times over, but everything will always be perfect: the editing, with over 75 different shots, perfectly, *ahem* cut (pun intended), the score, Bernard Herrman's perfect violins: 'eek! eek! eeek! eek!, and of course, Janet Leigh's screams.<br /><br />I was especially impressed by the haunting moment where the mortally wounded Marion holds out her hand, for no real reason. It just makes an awesome shot. Oh, erm, spoiler alert?<br /><br />I would also like to hand out a whole bucket of praise to Anthony Perkins. The film just wouldn't be what it is today without his iconic and brilliant performance of the delusional, schizophrenic, psychotic, insane, utterly charming mama's boy Norman Bates. This is a performance that deserves to rank among the all-time greatest, not just in horror films, but in cinema in general. This guy not only gives Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter a run for his money, but also Orson Welles, James Stewart, and Daniel Day-Lewis.<br /><br />Do not go into this movie expecting to be not afraid. Anthony Perkins will get under your skin and stay there. Norman Bates (who, with just the flimsiest of threads is tied to real-life psychopath Ed Gein) will enter the film as the utterly charming and sincere boy-next-door. He's got a disarming smile, a quick laugh, and a boyish charm about him. He could easily be your best friend.<br /><br />By the end of the film, he will have creeped you out of your wits, scared you, disturbed you, mesmerized you, repulsed you, and haunted you on a mental and psychological level. The brilliant line \\"A boy's best friend is his mother\\", seems harmless at first, but will summon terrible visions of an old woman in a rocking chair to Psycho veterans, and the line \\"We all go a little mad sometimes\\" is flawlessly delivered by Perkins, whose follow-up - a winning smile, WILL SEND SHIVERS DOWN YOUR SPINE. Honestly, Bates is one of cinema's all-time greatest, most terrifying villains. Anthony Perkins was a _criminally_ underrated actor. So few people recognize his talents. Thankfully they live forever in films like Psycho and Murder on the Orient Express.<br /><br />Bates's final scene has got to be one of the most chilling and haunting ends to a film I have ever seen. I wouldn't spoil it for you, but let me just say it packs a chilling punch. The Kubrick stare...oh the eyes, oh the smile, not the skull! MAKE IT STOP! If Psycho were a real thing, everyone who has ever seen the film would still have teeth marks where Hitchcock leapt right for the throat and didn't let go.<br /><br />I would also like to give some praise to Mother, for being cinema's scariest villain that is never seen. I am telling you, that woman will scare you at the most fundamental and psychological level. Her final reveal is a flawless mix of suspense, dread, and shock effect.<br /><br />In conclusion, well, I'll put it simply. Psycho is one of the scariest movies ever made. Hitchcock broke all the rules and CREATED modern horror with his masterpiece, a film he considered a joke or a black comedy. Oh Hitchcock, you sly dog. To this day, audiences are screaming. You sly dog indeed.<br /><br />And what about the ultimate test? Will you be afraid to take a shower? Probably not; hygiene will probably win out over the fear of a delusional, schizophrenic, knife-wielding maniac.<br /><br />But, like me, you're probably going to want to check under the sink first.a's all-time greatest, most terrifying villains.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|Living in China has it's perks.<br /><br />Cinema tickets are dirt cheap, for one. The movies stay in theatres longer. China is the fastest growing movie market, and many big Hollywood films (Looper, Iron Man 3, World War Z, Transformers 4) are catering to China to capitalize investment, leading to cool bonus features, premieres, and early releases.<br /><br />There are downsides, though.<br /><br />On a good year, 15 blockbusters will come out (The only 2013 Hollywood films to come to China so far are: Oz: The Great and Powerful, Jack the Giant Slayer, Oblivion, Iron Man 3, The Croods, Man of Steel, and Star Trek Into Darkness. UPDATE: After Earth, White House Down, Fast and Furious 6, and Pacific Rim have come too). They will ALL have Chinese subtitles. None of them (except for the aforementioned China-Hollywood partnerships) will be released on time, leaving viewers like me waiting as long as a month to see a film. I had to go to Hong Kong to see The Hobbit in theatres. And worst, to watch a film with a Chinese audience is destroy the sacred ritual of movie watching, and open up to a barrage of jabbering, phone calls, and Chinese ads before the movie.<br /><br />But I'm not complaining. Well, I kind of am. But this system means that only the biggest films come into China, sparing us from the chaff and Adam Sandler comedies. Who wouldn't want that?<br /><br />...<br /><br />So that's a run down of foreign cinema in China, told from a first-hand basis. Lets get down to Iron Man 3.<br />The film, directed by Shane Black of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang fame, got a lot of buzz for having roughly 5 minutes of extra, only-seen-in-China bonus features. It was rumoured to star veteran character actor WANG XUEQI and superstar FAN BINGBING (A very popular Chinese actress and model. Think the Chinese Angelina Jolie. I actually had the pleasure of bumping into her one night as she was swarmed around by jubilant fans while visiting the Canton Tower. True story!)<br /><br />...<br /><br />So what of the extra footage? Well, to put it simply - mildly, even...it was TERRIBLE. The scenes had a knack for completely and utterly destroying all tension in the film. They were conveniently placed around action scenes or strategic emotional moments to just let the tension fall from the movie. Don't get me wrong; the bonus scenes did not ruin the film, which I greatly enjoyed, and found it fun, action-packed, emotional, and, at times, hilarious. Review and overview of the scenes below, but first, you'll have to forgive me - my Chinese is not fluent, but I get around. So don't expect fancy translations. Also, I have never seen the foreign theatrical version, so if you people NOT in China have seen a scene here, let me know in the comments.<br /><br />SCENE 1: At the party in 1990, Tony Stark is introduced to a Dr. Wu (Wang Xueqi), by Dr. Yinsen (see Iron Man). He is told Wu is one of the foremost authorities on advanced surgery: something that will come up later on in the film. Wu talks to Tony in straight Chinese. Tony does not understand, but laughs and says, \\"I like your style\\" and invites him to \\"Party sometime\\". This is the best of the bonus scenes, and the only time Downey Jr. has contact with any of the Chinese actors.<br /><br />SCENE 2: Dr. Wu is seen back in China, years later. TV screens in the background show Iron Man in Beijing, school-children clapping, and Wu shaking hands with the metal-suited billionaire before he blasts off into the sky. He then gets on the phone with someone who is suspected to be JARVIS (Tony's robot helper), where he talks for several minutes. I have no idea what he was saying, but it was dull, unnecessary, and basically served as filler while they stuck in product placement. I later learned he is looking to contact Stark, urgently.<br />Smack dab in the most obvious place on the screen is the word \\"ZOOMLION\\" - the name of a construction company.<br /><br />SCENE 3: An unmemorable continuation of the above. Wu continues to talk on the phone. He is careful, reserved, as if talking to someone important.<br /><br />SCENE 4: This scene takes place after the climax. Fan Bingbing is seen walking down a hospital corridor wearing an unconvincing nurse's outfit, but looking gorgeous, carrying some papers. She opens the door to Dr. Wu's office, and OHMIGOD, what in the name of the great green goblin? He's pouring himself a drink. Of a cheap, common soymilk drink, available in every hole-in-the-wall shop. This is the most shameless product placement I have _ever_ seen.<br /><br />SCENE 5: The two characters - Wu, and his assistant, prepare for their operation on Tony Stark. They wash their hands, stare at themselves in mirrors, and put on surgical gloves. This is so melodramatic and overdone it looks like a cheap Chinese soap opera. I wanted to throw something at the damn screen. They talk about how dangerous it is, and what is at stake. They realize they are risking the life of the world's most powerful superhero.<br /><br />SCENE 6: Tony Stark is seen under the knife as Dr. Wu operates on him. Acupuncture needles are seen in his arms, and Wu removes a tiny piece of shrapnel from his chest with forceps, then drops it as it is sucked up by an electromagnet, where several other pieces of shrapnel are seen.<br /><br />SCENE 7: Wu is seen on another phone call, where he is glad to know that the mission worked out all right.<br /><br />All the scenes comprise perhaps 4-5 minutes.<br /><br />BONUS: The two actors get placement in the credits.<br />MEGA-DISAPPOINTMENT: For some unfathomable reason, there is NO post-credit scene with Mark Ruffalo. I stayed until the screen went black. Nothing, nada, 没有!<br /><br />Conclusion: There is literally _nothing_ to miss in the Chinese scenes, which feature wooden acting, poor plot and dialogue, and shameless product placement. They do not contribute to the film in anyway, but they do not detract from it, as evinced by Iron Man 3's billion dollar payout.<br /><br />................<br /><br />What did I think of the film itself? I liked it very much! Shane Black directs with style, the action is fast-paced, explosive, and engaging, the screenplay is sharp and witty, and filled with twists, Robert Downey Jr. IS _the Bomb_, Ben Kingsley steals the scenes, the plot is action-packed, surprisingly emotional, and with a satisfying conclusion. The score by Brian Tyler is completely fantastic - reminding one of the James Bond theme. My favorite movie soundtrack of the year, tied with Hans Zimmer's operatic Man of Steel score.<br /><br />I predicted this would be a money-making success from the very beginning. It's nothing serious, nothing weighty - just Marvel firing on all cylinders, and the result is an entertaining summer blockbuster. It _does_ have problems - that Mandarin Twist is now infamous and makes a sizeable portion of the audience feel cheated, and there are numerous plot holes (In one scene, one of the Extremis soldiers heats up his hand to metal-melting temperate...with his WATCH on!)<br /><br />But I chose to play along with the twists, and was swept away with the ride.<br /><br />And what a ride it is!<br /><br />4.1 Stars! Highly Recommended!<br /><br />...<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed my review on the Chinese scenes in Iron Man 3. If you missed them, there is really no need to worry. But if you really DO want to see them, Marvel is releasing a One Shot (short film) called The Prologue that will feature these China only scenes.<br /><br />Cheers from China!ve.

This is the most shameless product placement I have _ever_ seen.<br /><br />SCENE 5: The two characters - Wu, and his assistant, prepare for their operation on Tony Stark. They wash their hands, stare at themselves in mirrors, and put on surgical gloves. This is so melodramatic and overdone it looks like a cheap Chinese soap opera. I wanted to throw something at the damn screen. They talk about how dangerous it is, and what is at stake. They realize they are risking the life of the world's most powerful superhero.<br /><br />SCENE 6: Tony Stark is seen under the knife as Dr. Wu operates on him. Acupuncture needles are seen in his arms, and Wu removes a tiny piece of shrapnel from his chest with forceps, then drops it as it is sucked up by an electromagnet, where several other pieces of shrapnel are seen.<br /><br />SCENE 7: Wu is seen on another phone call, where he is glad to know that the mission worked out all right.<br /><br />All the scenes comprise perhaps 4-5 minutes.<br /><br />BONUS: The two actors get placement in the credits.<br />MEGA-DISAPPOINTMENT: For some unfathomable reason, there is NO post-credit scene with Mark Ruffalo. I stayed until the screen went black. Nothing, nada, 没有!<br /><br />Conclusion: There is literally _nothing_ to miss in the Chinese scenes, which feature wooden acting, poor plot and dialogue, and shameless product placement. They do not contribute to the film in anyway, but they do not detract from it, as evinced by Iron Man 3's billion dollar payout.<br /><br />................<br /><br />What did I think of the film itself? I liked it very much! Shane Black directs with style, the action is fast-paced, explosive, and engaging, the screenplay is sharp and witty, and filled with twists, Robert Downey Jr. IS _the Bomb_, Ben Kingsley steals the scenes, the plot is action-packed, surprisingly emotional, and with a satisfying conclusion. The score by Brian Tyler is completely fantastic - reminding one of the James Bond theme. My favorite movie soundtrack of the year, tied with Hans Zimmer's operatic Man of Steel score.<br /><br />I predicted this would be a money-making success from the very beginning. It's nothing serious, nothing weighty - just Marvel firing on all cylinders, and the result is an entertaining summer blockbuster. It _does_ have problems - that Mandarin Twist is now infamous and makes a sizeable portion of the audience feel cheated, and there are numerous plot holes (In one scene, one of the Extremis soldiers heats up his hand to metal-melting temperate...with his WATCH on!)<br /><br />But I chose to play along with the twists, and was swept away with the ride.<br /><br />And what a ride it is!<br /><br />4.1 Stars! Highly Recommended!<br /><br />...<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed my review on the Chinese scenes in Iron Man 3. If you missed them, there is really no need to worry. But if you really DO want to see them, Marvel is releasing a One Shot (short film) called The Prologue that will feature these China only scenes.<br /><br />Cheers from China!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|For those who have already fallen in love with Downton Abbey, this season is not a disappointment. A little slow in places but has interesting new characters and evolution of the old beloved characters.
0060987464|5.0|Cover bound well and intact. No loose or bend pages. Was used to obtain the autograph of the man himself.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This used to be nice simple little app.  Then they 'upgraded'. Now it has ads, the maps stink, the face is all foo fooey. They ruined a good thing.
B0011Z5IIC|5.0|For years this was my favorite album of all time. I still think it is absolutely excellent. I never skip a single song when I listen to this CD, and I can listen to it often without getting overwhelmed by it. All the songs stick with me, as do the lyrics and the beats, and even if I don't hear any of them for a while, when I hear them again, I remember every part and how much I love it. Each song is good, but there are certainly ones that stand out. Personally, Cemetery Drive is my favorite. Helena is a great single choice as well.<br /><br />I think this is by far MCR's best album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game got it for my 3yr old and we both can't stop playing<br />The graphics r awesome wish it was a little easier to get upgrades of accessories
B004CAWKXE|3.0|Personally, I was disappointed with this album. I'm not the biggest MCR fan, but I'd loved a couple of their previous albums and Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge was my favorite album of all time for years. Danger Days didn't hook me like some of MCR's other albums have. The singles are decent, but when I listened to the album, there was nothing else that caught my attention. After my first listen through I really had no desire to listen again. I still listen to the singles from time to time, but the rest of the album just didn't do it for me. It wasn't bad, just not as good as I'd previously perceived the band to be. Maybe my standards were too high and I was too caught up in the past to enjoy this album.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed fifty shades of grey myself. So, I was excited to learn of this book. While others feel this book might be a rip off I felt that it was a welcome book in a similar genre. I felt that the main characters of both books were actually quite different from each other in terms of life experiences and character. How they were very similar was in their generic descriptors and hey that formula worked well the first time. There are some strikingly similar experiences in this book compared to fifty shades but having the characters react differently was part of the entertainment. Overall this series is more well written. That shouldn't be a surprise given this was a contracted author to write this versus the off the cuff version from EL James.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|Many years ago, while living in Detroit, I watched Ayrton Senna win two of the three first place finishes.. The biography you put together of his life,  showed what a great human being Senna was with all people around the world. His leagacy  will live on.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|it is a different twist to the angry birds game, lots of fun once I figured out the object to the game.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I have become a fan of Scalzi.  The Old Man's War is real page turner.  I would encourage the readers to continue the saga of Perry and Sagan in the follow on novels.  I'm not easily &#34;hooked&#34; on a novel but from the first page you will want to find out what comes next.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|easy to use and can check my bids with ease, couldn't be easier to buy and sell.<br />have made the point to fellow ebayers
140006922X|5.0|Tremendous book that does a good job reviewing the historical period and placing it in a compelling narrative voice.  Well done.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this sight I was happy to see I could get the app for this, I would rat this high and brag to my friends about it
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I enjoyed very much all the historical information regarding the subject. It's my first Dawkins' book and I can't wait to read more of his writings. He makes a very strong case and supports it well. I wish every religious (any) and non-religious people would read this informative book.
B00BHBBSZ2|1.0|I can not really rate this yet I got the app but  I haven't used it yet plan to soon
B008133MDK|5.0|I've just recently been willing to sit through mystery shows ( I still won't read mystery books) so it was with some hesitation that I began watching Sherlock.  The two main characters take a few episodes to grow on you, but once they do the show is very entertaining.  I love the unique twists they are giving the Sherlock stories, and I hope they will add more unique story plots as well.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|To fun for words and I have told my friends about this game and my grandson loves to steel the game at ever chance he gets.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Just heard this group last month for first time on Palladia. Great sound. Authentic southern culture sounds with all the diversity and various influences that help craft southern music. Hard to fit into a specific genre, but each song is a bit different and does not sound like 12 version of the same core song or remixes....Good production and heart felt lyrics.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It is very touchy and the game doesn't follow your finger in direction for crap. will not recommend this game
B00COGY2P2|3.0|On the shy side of good, this movie would have been a lot better except for the really lame acting of Rosamund Pike. She was unbelievable and reminded me of a younger version of Catherine Hicks, who also can't act. Tom was his usual self, but nothing special. Was it worth watching? Maybe as free streaming when you're really bored. The three stars mean &#34;It's okay&#34;, and that really is about it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I love playing this game. I love how annimated it is and my kids are great at it!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love shows that are interesting, well written and acted. Falling Skies meets that criteria. I really like how they introduce  new characters (both friend and foe). The only downside is that I know certain actors will survive. Still, it is fast paced, dynamic and thought provoking.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Fun characters and well done movie wish it was twice as long!  Great job every one on this story plot
B000P407K4|5.0|I watched the movie when it first came to the big screen. I am still impressed by the detail of character, of the time, and how something like this could still happen.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|Fun movie that makes fun of this genre if a fan watch it you will laugh, fun actors and actresses
1907563202|3.0|The projects look like a lot of fun and are very colorful but buyers should know that the hook holder, purses, and bags all have linings and require some sewing ability and a machine, neither of which I possess.  I am a total beginner, so far having used only the single crochet stitch to make dish clothes.  I was looking forward to some really easy, simple projects (no color changes, no sewing, etc.) but there aren't many here.  For my purposes, the book is not very helpful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read this book twice now, I'm in love with it!!!! I just want to read them all  again and again!!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|this game has been enjoyable enough to keep playing for a couple of months. i recommend it if you are looking to pass the time.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I watch this movie over and over again never gets old. The characters in this movie are hilarious I mean really, Fat Amy?  For sure to be a classic! :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved this little guy. This game is fun to play. I know my  grandkids will love playing  this game.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I am only half through season one but it's good so far.  I don't have cable so I started this one during a long hot weather week.  Nice time killer.  Hope it picks up though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game is challenging to the mind and sight. It increases your ability think as well as make you eager to see what awaits you on the next floor or level. I really enjoyed it, and look forward to see what's next.
B001ECPJZO|3.0|I ordered this Tie-Up Shoe so I could teach my grandson to tie his shoes.The shoe is 4&#34; long and about 2 3/4&#34; wide.The shoe is very small and lightweight which makes it unstable when trying to tie the shoelace. The loops on the shoe are fabric which make it difficult for his little fingers to maneuver the lace through. The shoe just moves around too much due to the size of it when trying to lace it.<br />I ended up buying the Melissa and Doug shoe. It is much larger and more stable when working with it. The directions for tying the shoelace are also attached to the bottom of the shoe. He is also able to get the lace through easier than with this one. The Melissa and Doug one is the better buy.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Mr. Bullock is correct in his perceptive analysis, however, the most gregious and unacceptable problem with this movie is the 3D rendering. Double images and ghosting pervade throughout the whole picture, although the movie seems to improve on the imaging in the last half of the movie. The technicians doing the 3D processing should take lessons from the gurus at the Disney studios. Ridley Scott...were you absent during the editing?
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A thoughtful book even considering the topic of zombies. It can be slow and technical in a few spots but for the most part a honest look  at what can occur when things go real bad.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|my wife spends all her spare time playing it..lol..so i can do all the things i need with out being bothered
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I like period pieces. I think the villages are very nice in this series. The costumes are very authentic looking. I would reccommend this series.
B00BMQPXC6|5.0|Better than a shot of espresso in the morning. Also a good pick-me-up for later in the day. Con moto!
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn Died this year so there will be no more of his fabulous books.  All of his books except Term Limits feature CIA Agent Mitch Rapp.  I have 2 strong recommendations.  Read term Limits first as it sets the stage for the Rapp series and 2, you MUST read the rest of the books in the order they were published.  The Rapp series is  a saga and the timeline is an important part of that saga.  Flynn's books are spellbinding and is the most intriguing writer I have followed and I read a lot.  You will not be disappointed in this book unless you read it out of series order.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was not ready for the end and now I can't wait to read the next book!!!!!and I also can't wait for the movie
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I have heard about Breaking Bad for years, but never watched it until a few weeks ago.  My wife and I watched Season 1, got hooked and now are enjoying Season 2.  Like all great TV or movies (for example, The Sopranos), Breaking Bad has great acting and writing at its core.  Never predictable and always fascinating, with lots of black humor. Fortunately, there are more seasons yet to watch ans enjoy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife is devoted to this series.  She was thrilled to be able to watch it on her schedule.  Thanks.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I enjoy playing this game almost to the point of addicted...however these past few days the game been freezing up...I've had to delete it from my kindle fire twice &amp; download it again...definitely not good for someone who is developing a habit :(
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I read the first book in this series, liked it and thought I'd try the next. A pleasant way to pass a day
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Angry Birds Star Wars! I love the sound effects, you feel like you should have a &#34;lightsaber&#34; in your hand!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I cried, I laughed, I was on the edge. I love how Prince Maxon cares so much for America but I hate his dates with other girls, and while he's with the others I am hoping the whole time Aspen is close by to give her company! I can't believe I have to wait a year for The One!!!!!
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I love the Ice age series and so far this is my favorite. Not so crazy about Continental drift tho
B008X8P8A8|4.0|I have to say that this is probably one of the only android games I've ever actually enjoyed playing. The graphics are very colorful and enjoyable to look at, and the music is top notch (though recycled from Shogun 2). The gameplay is fun, simple and also not too difficult to master. The campaign mode is quite long for a mobile game, and it took me a reasonable amount of time to beat it. Now, I do have a few issues with this game. One problem is that building system is a little complicated and really involves a lot more strategy/thinking than does placing actual units. As for the units themselves, some are simply useless, the monks are absolutely no help at all and pretty much just waste space on your unit limit. This brings us to the next problem with this game, the unit limit is simply way too low. This ruins the whole idea of strategy since you will often hit the limit before you can place the units you wanted to. Lastly, the computer cheats, most often in skirmish mode, by using more resources than they actually have access to, which makes beating the computer impossible on any difficulty past Normal. Despite these problems, the game is very fun and is certainly worth the mere $2 it costs.
0385349947|5.0|Gave it to all my daughter's friends as a college graduation present! Something for them to think about, even if they never read it! But hope they do!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you like puzzles &amp; a challenge, then this is the game for you! It's very addicting &amp; I leaves you wanting to know what the next step will reveal. Well worth the price. I definitely will recommend to anyone!
B00DU74U74|5.0|Great twist on alien movie.  Love the actress.  Shes really good and Its only similar to her other books in slight ways so don't worry.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|The People Running The These Agencies R Scary. All of them just want to kill. Kill everyone to Save the Money, their names,the agency. All are True Psychopaths. Aaron Cross/Jeremy Renner.they kill the innocent frightening if These Agencies actually exist. He outsmarted them at every turn and once the Doctor (Rachel Weisz) got on board they were a team. Great scene with the Wolves inventive,creative Quick Thinking Agent/Soldier LOVE THIS MOVIE ACTION AND ADVENTURE.
B00A7MSHHO|3.0|this is a really great looking batman figure, but as soon as I took it out of the box both of his arms fell off... what the heck!?
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|This is a show that I've seen several times and it never gets old. It's clean and non-violent, but there's still plenty of excitement and certainly a lot of ethical questions to consider. I find myself rooting for Truman as the show goes on and practically cheering by the end. Love this movie!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|great game and all but the cost for the other sharks are not the best but its still a great game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 is as good as or better then the first two. Love seeing how this aristocratic family copes with the changes that so rapidly began in the 20th century.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever u can do any thing see any be any thing u can fight zombies dead stuff and have fun
B0041KBWM0|4.0|It took a while to warm up to this Emma, but it's probably the version that's closest to the book. Definitely worth seeing if you're a Jane Austen fan.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just the other day I was trying to add in my head sometimes that's hard so I found this app by accident...
B007RI56NY|3.0|Typical 2012 pop group with bubblegum style music ... teenager like it, and it's not getting on my nerves (yet).
B0063IH60K|3.0|I always have enjoyed playing this game and this app works well. I have had a glitch a few times where the app won't load and I have to remove it from my system and then reload it and that usually fixes it. I also think their are too many ads but it is a free app and they need money some how.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|It's a cute movie and I thought the way they incorporated elements of the game were pretty cool.  I think if it hadn't have been released around the same time as the Avengers it would have done a lot better in theaters.
B00138H876|5.0|One of the all time great Dylan albums, including the classic Tangled up in Blue. And I'd love to listen to it, but Amazon has made it so difficult to download I haven't been able to. Don't think I'll be buying any further music from Amazon, even though I've always had great luck with them on so many other items. I've been buying from Amazon since the days they only handled books....you know, the ones with printed paper pages between colorful covers?
B004OEMRGI|5.0|With a Westerners ear, the first time listening is a little bit of an experience. The more I listen to it, the more I have become addicted to it to the point where I play the CD over and over again.<br />The song &#34;Tar Hani&#34; is fantastic with clear influence from Blues greats.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|The movie had good effects but a thin, lackluster plot.  My 10 and 11 year old nieces liked it OK - probably 3.5 stars.  The adults liked it less - more like 2 stars.  I suspect the film came out in theaters with 3D, because much of the action seemed like it was geared for the 3D format.  I wish it would have been one of my free selections on Amazon Prime.  I don't think it was worth the rental $.
B0090SI582|1.0|I admit, I'm not a big X-Men fan, but even my wife who is obsessed with these movies agreed that this one is a slow, boring, disappointing, snore-fest.<br /><br />It kicks off in the past with Logan as a prisoner in Japan before the big one drops. A solider from the Japanese prison camp is rescued by Wolverine and owes him his life. Cut to many years later, Logan is now a bum in the woods working for the animal protection agency of horribly fake CGI bears. A bear is killed, and Logan is off to the bar for a brawl. That's where he meets the granddaughter of the man from Japan who tells him not to bother with small men, and to come with her to Japan so her now dying grandfather can say goodbye and get one last kiss from Logan. Logan and her go back to Japan and it turns out her dying grandfather owns the biggest corporation in Japan and he actually wants to find out how to regenerate/heal himself as Logan can. Fights, fights, snore, snore, fight, snore, fight, robot, snore, end.<br /><br />Overall, the opening scene has a slow motion explosion with a lot of people running around as a bomb is about to go off. Not all that much action. Then onto a long and drawn out snore fest of talking about this and that, and stupid dream sequences of whats-her-face now in love with Logan and not Cyclops. Makes sense, right? No. Pay's off in the end but, right? No.<br /><br />There is 2 and a half mutants in this whole movie. This is X-Men right? The only new mutant other than Logan is a doctor introduced who is called Viper. She is a terrible actress, and a pretty disappointing character. All she does is sheds and licks things to death while having an annoying over confident attitude. Her role is pretty pathetic. The other one is the granddaughter of the Japanese guy, I think her name was Red Head Chun Li or something? and her sister is Princess no-body. Her mutant power? Shes a psychic. Is she even a mutant? Hardly. But you hear a reference to genes skipping a generation and she copped it. Lame, she's not a mutant. They only claim she is.<br /><br />So, Logan is infected with something and loses his ability to heal, yet has enough remaining mutant power to not be killed by bullets and arrows and anything else they shoot at him. Does this sound familiar? A super hero loses his power and has to learn to remember what is like to be vulnerable again? Anyway, in the end Tony Stark, I mean Logan regains his powers, turns into the wolf and wins the high school basketball game. Wait, wrong movie again. Oh yeah, he earns a body guard and goes nowhere... literately.<br /><br />There is not enough action, too much boring talking, and a stupid ending with Robo-Samari Man. Really, 2 and a bit mutants, one Wolverine, and a robot bad guy? What kind of X-men movie do you call this? I say it happened like this. \\"Mr Jackman, we had a bunch of monkeys write a script to cash in on the X-men franchise. It's really sucky, but we will pay you a couple of million, sign here please\\".<br /><br />It's bad enough the prices to see movies in theatres these days, and there overpriced watered down drinks and expensive foods... people pay good money for these things these days... and yet they still produce crap like this today? IN AN X-MEN MOVIE? My god. WHY, HOW did this get made? WHO gave it the green light? This adds NOTHING to the overall story, and was just a dumb excuse to have a movie with Jackman in it again as a character people wanted to see him in, but he had better apologize big time for how disappointing this POS was.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Hard to put the game down!!! I stayed up way too late to finish it!!! Loved the variety of puzzles!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great E-Mail service, been using it for years. Yahoo mail has always been a favorite of mine on several generations of lap top computers.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is by far one of the best SiFi shows that I have watched. It pulls you in, keeps you entertained and even gets a laugh out of you once in awhile. The acting is great too. I love Noah Wyle and have since ER. He is a good actor. I highly recommend this show for the alien sifi lovers!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I'm a big fan of fantasy that isn't over the top - too often, fantasy books are either Lord of the Rings ripoffs or have so much jargon and magic thrown around that I lose interest.  Not this one.  This book was amazing on so many levels.  Finally a good fantasy book!
B0085YOD1A|1.0|this may be easy for some, but there are no instructions about how to get it onto my kindle fire
B008M4MB8K|3.0|The producers of this version got real cheap on us and put this 2-hour hd film on a single layer bluray disc. The sound is compressed as and is not full quality pcm. The video quality never goes above 20mbps. This is really unacceptable for a collectors edition. Your average bluray will be on a double layer disc and average about 35mbps in video and will always be uncompressed in terms of audio.<br />I really love this movie and was really excited about seeing it on bluray. Bluray makes a big difference in 80's films because they were generally lit very dark as it was the style. Because of the low quality of the hd conversion, the movie in turn looks very grainy and the contrast is not very good. DVDs are usually around 8-9 mbps this bluray is not much better. Soooo disappointed here.<br />I am sure this decision to use single layer bluray saved lots of money, but it is really a slap in the face to fans of this film.<br />Oh yeah ... the packaging is really nice.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app every day, added my home town then planned my vacation after I added the location and was able to pack for the weather conditions. Thank you.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|good game lots of fun but I'm still waiting for a build your own deck setup. I want to build a custom prism deck
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This game is super fun but if you have it correct is doesn't always work. It get frustrating sometimes. But it really works your mind. I kinda recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this app is a fun and challenging app it your brain has to puzzle together what to do . HAVE FUN
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Good movie. We have watched this several times. (Twilight fans, so we like Kristen.) Worth the money. No disappointments. Thanks.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Entertaining and challenging. My daughters loves it. She plays several games and says this is her favorite.  She is 8 and my other daughter is 6.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Old people can do things too. Shoot people, make jokes, all kinds of things. I was happy with one scene- Bruce and the car spin.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game is very engaging and relaxing, yet has enough goals and challenges to keep you interested.  Great fun for fans of the series.  I have to disagree with complaints of the cash shop.  I feel it is balanced, and the ponies or shops that are ridiculously expensive are the premium or rare ones you'd expect to see as cash only (see Celestia).  Easy to spend hours playing.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I went to see this movie at the theater when I was traveling and had nothing else to do. I was not expecting much and it is usually hit or miss with a Tom Cruise movie. I was really surprised how good the movie was. I love SciFi but have been disappointed in much of the recent crop that has come out. Oblivion had a unique story with a couple of good twists.<br /><br />Even people that are not SciFi fans will enjoy the story if you like a little suspense and mystery. Definitely worth a rental!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Only neg is that I can &quot;t send invoices using the app.  The app is easy to use.  Easy to see status of sold items.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|Love this game really mind stimulating...it comes in handy at work sitting at my desk with nothing to do .
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|I've been a Kelly Clarkson fan forever. She exhibits great vocals and just &#34;kills&#34; with her lyrics. This purchase was merely a supplement for my Kindle that I already own in CD.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Fun game but the only downside is that you have to use two coins per game and it takes forever to be able to get more.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|I have a variety of all of these songs in various formats and on various CDs. This album made it &#34;Kindle-Friendly&#34; and I can continue with being a rock or an island in a sound of silence.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|it was really addictive at first... then I got to level six and it was easy at first then you get to this little pyramid thingy and its really hard and its not like these games have hints either, I looked for the cheats or hints or whatever you want to call them but there are none so I'm stuck on level six trying to find a little wieght thing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is by far the best game on my kindle so far!!!  So much fun,  I play it every day.
B00C7DGQ9C|3.0|But it is fantastic!! I'm a big fan of Jeremy Renner and Genna Arterton.  Just a good ol' action movie with a fairy tale twist.
0763617105|5.0|It is a sImple yet loving story.  The illustrations are wonderful.  Very happy with the purchase. I would recommend to others.
B006S01GH2|4.0|I love French subtitled movies...and this had a great plot.<br />At first  it was WOW then after it just got more involved.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Ought Oh, A Prequel? Really? What are you doing to a great series?<br /><br />Those were the first thoughts that came to mind when I found out this book was coming. All I can really say is WOW. I loved it. It even provides some closer to the series that I didn't feel, what was to be, the final book did.<br /><br />James yet again grips your attention early on and takes you on an incredible word roller coaster. It's a great way to end a series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time! Absolutely love it! On  o  the best hors  app  I've seen.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I got this book because of other books by this author that I have enjoyed. I was not disappointed. This was so much better then I thought it would be. He catches your interest early and never let's go. I was left wanting the next book.<br /><br />If you are a book junkie and can't handle waiting to start the next in a series, make sure you have all of them first. Even the prequel!
B0046B3QTG|3.0|Very simple story.  Never quite figured out what the accent meant.  Not bad, but I was hoping for more after all the hype and commercials.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It's a movie that has a great feel to it and leaves you feeling like you actually spent your time doing something worth while. Fathers step it up. Watch closely and take something good from it and apply it to your lives.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I have always liked Bruce and this is one of his better movies. I the story line and look forward to RED 2. Good action and chemistry with all characters.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|James continues to write in such a way as to completely captivate you. He continues the Maze Runner Series with this amazing read. I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />He creates some intense imagery with what some may consider to be overly graphic portrayals of... I guess you'll have to read it to find out.<br /><br />Enjoy the journey!
0142410705|5.0|John Green hasn't let me down yet, and I've read all of his books. This one was a fun read with a happy ending and I enjoyed the characters so much.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for a nice and fun read.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is one of the best Daniel Craig (Bond) movies I've seen. The action is great and not overly intense like in some movies as of late. Get story with great action. I may just go home to night and watch it again.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|There are many disney type movie worth of remembering and this is one of them. The story had sense with great end, with many small extremly ilarious happenings.
B00A83075M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Flashback to the fun video game I played as a kid. My kiddos really liked it as well. All around it's a great movie for everyone in the family.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I loved the color graphics. It was very good but nothing tops the Wizard of Oz. I recommend this movie.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|James continues the Maze Runner series in this book, but I feel it fell just short of the story previously being told. Don't get me wrong, the story is a good one and his writing is gripping and entertaining, but this book fell a notch in comparison to the previous 2 in the series.<br /><br />His writing is incredible and yet again he continues to suck you into the Maze Runner world. My rating of 4 stars is only because it fell shy of the first 2 in the series. I fully recommend this read to all.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I thought the premise was fun but the movie itself was really noisy!  I can see how children would love the constant noise got to me after a while.<br /> k in cody
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Ok, maybe I shouldn't say this, but even my 8 year old son likes this movie. He is not the type to fall for a girly movie. He likes Ninjago and superheros and sonic video games, but this he will watch. That really says a lot. Of course my girls all love it. It's a cute movie, and come on really, who doesn't like Tinkerbell?
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I grew up in the North but painfully aware of the indignities people heap on those they feel superior to.  I waited for this movie quite some time since when it first came out, it was very expensive.  I am certainly glad I read the book first and then saw the movie.  I feel I got a lot more out of it.  I am glad I finally did see the movie and it is haunting.  k in cody
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This is a great follow to Dark Night. It didn't fail in the action or story line. It is very well directed and acted. The special effects are great as always. I just hope it's not a gateway to Robin. Nightwing could be cool though!<br /><br />I think you love this movie. It's great!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app is lots of fun. I wish it would give you more of a tutorial so you know which tabs in the journal are which. I love the graphics.  I don't know if I would recommend this app to anyone though.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is a great movie for the entire family. It's fun to watch and has great humor. My kids love this movie and it has some great clean lines that keep even adults entertained.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|this opens the door ways to all of amazon, makes thing easy and fun.  i like it, use it all the time
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Okay, let's face it, this is not the Bourne movie we all fell in love with. Was it a bomb, no! Not in my opinion at least. It doesn't live up to the first 3, but it is entertaining and does allow for a return of Jason, who of course made these as popular as they are.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner is not Jason Bourne, that role is left for Matt Damon. Jeremy plays a role for a character caught in a parallel conspiracy where at some point it ties in with Bourne.<br /><br />I gave this a 4 star because it's just not the Bourne we all wanted. It didn't live up the our overwhelming expectations, but it's a good movie. I recommend this to anyone who like the original Bourne movies.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I think the game is okay. The graphics are good. I have not found any tech issues in the game.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I could not let the book go and read it from first to last page in one swoop. It was wonderful reading!!!
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|It was a very complicated and strange movie.  The plot was very difficult to follow.  The one thing that was very good was the make-up and special effects.  Would not recommend this movie.
B0060CV7YK|5.0|This was my favorite childhood movie.  It was locked in the disney vault for years.  So happy it was available for instant download.
1609611543|1.0|I did not like this book I did not think it made any sense what so ever  waste of money
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Great book.  I love the story.  The author did a wonderful job.  I love the entire series.  Can't wait to ready the next one!
B004LPLU4K|4.0|Our 10 year old daughter really enjoyed the book and was disappointed to hear from a friend that the movie was a dud.  We decided to try it on Amazon Prime anyway, and were very pleasantly surprised!  The acting, sets/scenery and music were all fantastic, and the story followed the book closely.  Sure, it's not a Jerry Bruckheimer action flick but if your kids liked the pace and style of the book, you'll enjoy this film.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book.  I love the story.  The author did a wonderful job.  I love the entire series.  Can't wait to ready the next one!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Now I can watch this movie at home whenever I want to, and fangirl freak out over Magical Mister Mistoffelees!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book.  I love the story.  The author did a wonderful job.  I love the entire series.  Can't wait to ready the next one!
1609611543|5.0|This is a most important and excellent book, written by a Medical Doctor who researched this important issue of genetically modified wheat for the sake of US, the people out here in the world of doing our best, against  dangerous odds against keeping ourselves and our families healthy!<br /><br />He and others bring this issue of why going Gluten Free is essential for the health of MANY thousands or more.<br />When doctors stop blandly treating SYMPTOMS  and look beneath them at the CAUSE, they may find we don't need Lyrica or Ibuprofin or Immodium or steroid ointments for excruciating rashes, and on an on.<br />Giving up ONE thing from our diets can be the difference between well and hell!  When  all the symptoms go away,<br />and blood gets healthier and brains stop shuffling along in a fog, you gotta ask:  What's different?  Answer, for those<br />who are Gluten sensitive or who have Celiac disease AND DIDN'T KNOW IT BECAUSE THEY WERE ONLY BEING TREATED FOR THE SYMPTOMS, they are  not eating the new wheat  that is making us sick! Take wheat away from the diet and get well.  This book is witty, warm and SMART.<br />There are other excellent books out there, but this one is REALLY good for honest straight talk and clarification.<br />I gave it 5 stars.!~
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book.  I love the story.  The author did a wonderful job.  I love the entire series.  Can't wait to ready the next one!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great story of the determination of a young lady facing some very difficult times.  We loved this movie and seeing this girl overcome some very large hurdles.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great book.  I love the story.  The author did a wonderful job.  I love the entire series.  Can't wait to ready the next one!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is done very well.  It was purchased for adults and will be shared with children as well - but the adults are really enjoying it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book.  I love the story.  The author did a wonderful job.  I love the entire series.  Can't wait to ready the next one!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|We love this movie.  The humor is great and the story is heart warming.  We watch it at least once every Christmas season.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book.  I love the story.  The author did a wonderful job.  I love the entire series.  Can't wait to ready the next one!
B000053VAZ|5.0|We had not even heard of this movie until recently.  We have purchased it for ourselves and a copy for each of our adult children.  It is a funny and heartwarming movie for all.  We really enjoyed it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book.  I love the story.  The author did a wonderful job.  I love the entire series.  Can't wait to ready the next one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Captivating story.  Draws you in and keeps your attention. Am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I found The Perks of Being a Wallflower to be a very engaging read.  While the lead characters are teenagers, it doesn't read like a young adult novel.
1781162646|2.0|I was expecting more from Stephen King. I was sadly disappointed and felt that the book dragged and dragged on......
B001AITGWE|5.0|Awesome movie. I love being able to get the good ole movies that I enjoy watching. It came on the date that it was supposed to.
B000002H6C|4.0|This is among with the fine early work of Metallica. It's amazing how guitarist/ vocalist James Hatfield managed to put together so many classic heavy metal packages one after another. There wasn't much time apart with them, so the time in the studio must have been a quality effort with the band. Hard driven and aggressive, the tunes mesh together finely once again.
B00821OX98|5.0|I can't wait until the next season is out! Great storyline (could do without the propaganda) looking forward to seaso three.
B002M80918|5.0|The only Western on AFI's top 10 list that includes Clint Eastwood had to be one he made himself, as the best movies of his career were in tune with the politics of the time. A bit slow to start as he builds character, story arcs, provides background and context for how the characters change and how he remains steadfastly anti-violence despite the material. His last western and the last he has to say on the subject. A must-have for any fan and any moviegoer. Add Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and one of Richard Harris' last roles, throw in some Frances Fisher - you'd have to be pretty cynical to even give it 4 stars.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app works well with a good deal of dev support. If you are having problems with it there is a great help guide that will get you working.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|fun to watch... fun to watch... funt to watch...fun to watch.. .did I mention i enjoyed it, if not I did.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I bought seasons 1-3 from amazon when they were first available. they came in great condition and on time. so did season 4. I ordered season 5 at the same time as this and it wont ship til sept which makes no sense at all but it is what it is.cant wait to watch it and catch up
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a show my husband and I both adore! The writing is clever, the setting is beautiful. We're Downton fans!
1455523550|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks.  He is a great author and the movies are usually portray the books but sometimes you have to change it up to make it more interesting.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I have not beat it yet, Young family members like it too.  Not a learning game, but good hand/eye workout.
0525478817|5.0|This is my all time favorite book. It is the only book that has ever made me cry, but it is soooo worth reading. They are actually even making a movie of this book, scheduled to release in 2014 in USA. The book came to me in absolutely perfect condition, i HIGHLY recommend buying and reading this book!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My great granddaughters 4, 5, 6, 7 enjoy it more than me as I get frustrated more easily.  But understand why it is so popular.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is so much fun it makes having a kindle so much more fun !!!!! When my battery dies I am sad and it dies every day !!!!!!!!!!
B009WHD3OW|5.0|Really enjoyed this light-hearted romp by the best &#34;action guys&#34; in the business. More fun, more action guys, and more story-line than 1st movie! All around winner for those of us who love action movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A really fun game, it's good for your boring moments or even for the awkward moments when you need to use your phone.
B00CW665VI|5.0|if you're looking for a fun, witty, quick read, this is the book for you! it was interesting to get a guy's POV i even learned a thing or two. you can't help but smile while reading this book because Drew has a certain way with words and phrases. there was a good amount of steamy and not a lot of angst. overall, very enjoyable and highly recommended :)
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|i really like the game its easy, and hard. fun and time killer. has differant lay outs witch make motivating to continue
B00DU74U74|3.0|I read the book and really liked it, but the movie just wasn't as good. I also didn't care for Saoirse Ronan as Melanie. I did like her in The Lovely Bones, but she annoyed me in this movie.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|It seemed in season on that Harvey won every case and each week's episode centered on  a new case for Harvey to win.  In season 2, life has become a little more diffucult for Harvey and he does not look so invincible.  I particularly like the case that has spanned at least the first 7 episodes of season 2 related to alleged fraud Harvey committed on a past case.  The addition of Daniel Hartman as the deposed managing partner who is trying to regain his crown is also an interesting story line. And of course Louis Lit continues to entertain in every episode.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|A GAME W/ NO BUGS!(@ LEAST NOT PLAYING ON MY HTC RHYME). GREAT POINT & CLICK ADVENTURE W/ MEDIUM CHALLENGE BUILT IN HINTS (ACCESSIBLE ONLY WHEN DESIRED) AND REALLY NICE GRAPHICS. AFTER PLAYING A LOT OF GAMES WITH A GREAT CONCEPT AND POOR EXECUTION THIS ONE STANDS OUT AS EXCEPTIONAL JUST BECAUSE IT WAS HASSLE FREE. PLEASE KEEP THE SCI-FI THEMES COMING. IT'S NICE TO HAVE CHOICES OTHER THAN SUPERNATURAL. GREAT GAME!
B0094AH3MU|4.0|Based on a work by Friedrich Schiller and composed just after his first attempt at adapting Shakespeare to the opera stage in Macbeth, I Masnadieri was another attempt by Verdi to put some literary weight behind his work. The work failed however to live up to its source and was not a success when it was first performed in London in 1847 with Verdi himself conducting. More conventionally structured than Macbeth, I Masnadieri is not the greatest Verdi by a long stretch and hasn't enjoyed the same popularity as its predecessor, but it's still Verdi all the same and with the right kind of production, even the composer's lesser works can be highly charged and thoroughly entertaining. That's certainly the case with this 2012 production of from the Teatro San Carlo in Naples.<br /><br />It's true however that the work is initially constrained by its conventional structure. Each of the principal characters are introduced in the First Act with cavatinas that express their nature and their ambitions. The stagy conventionality of this introduction is matched by the apportioning of the roles according to type - the hero inevitably is a tenor, the love interest is a soprano, the villain is a baritone and the father is a bass. No surprises there. Having introduced the characters however, Verdi launches into the highly charged drama of the situation with his usual fiery arrangements which, if it has the right kind of treatment, can nonetheless be highly effective. The secret to making such material work of course - as is the case with all Verdi's early melodramas - is in the commitment and delivery of the performances.<br /><br />A production of I Masnadieri stands or falls based on the performers, more so than the staging, but thankfully, the Naples production is strong in both areas. The orchestra playing needs to be both sensitive and dramatic, and you only need to listen to the solo cello playing in the overture to see Verdi's intentions as well as gain some measure of how well that is achieved here. The singing performances are not quite perfect but impressive in the context of the live performance, which is where this kind of work comes to life. Much rests on the situation of Carlo and Amalia in this respect and both roles are well catered for by Aquiles Machado and Lucrecia Garcia, but there are no real weaknesses here either in Giacomo Prestia's Massimiliano and Artur Rucinski's Francesco.<br /><br />The staging is also supportive of the tone adopted for the work. It's a non-period specific setting, but none of it changes the essential character of the work. Carlo and his bandits are dressed like \\"dandy highwaymen\\" in long black leather coats and scarves, more likely to be riding bikes than horses. Set designer Alessandro Camera's wasteland setting has the motto 'Libertà o Morte' (Freedom or Death) emblazoned with a skull as graffiti on the backing wall. Francesco's entourage look like party goths, and threats are made with drawn pistols rather than swords, but everything fits perfectly with the mood and the dark intent of the piece and its insistence on drama above all else. Performance comes together well then with the score and the setting to make this an excellent account of I Masnadieri.<br /><br />The production comes across well on Blu-ray, although there appears to be some minor image flicker in places. Audio tracks are PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 and the sound is vibrant and clear. As a part of the Tutto Verdi collection, the extra features contain the usual 10 minute Introduction places the work in the context of Verdi's career and gives an illustrated synopsis of the plot and characters. The disc is region-free, with subtitles in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book is quite  nice  And if you want to know the meaning of something this help help us quite good I love this dictionary especially Oxford
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written by an intelligent MD; well regarded with an almost incredible experience to share.  Believer or not; an excellent read.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Good graphics and car physics for a mobile game, and the Replay mode is awesome.<br />Overall fun and good game for the money. Please add more cars and tracks!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I've played a lot of games and thought this one was excellent. It is fun and challenging, a great game especially for their first!
B008602KQI|2.0|Of course Jennifer Lawrence is cute, and the CGI special effects wizards paint an interesting picture of dystopia, but the story is dull and very tedious. They could have made a good moral point in 90 minutes, but they dragged it out for another hour of emptiness instead.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci was pitch perfect in his role. Ms Lawrence needs to take some acting lessons, or maybe get a part that allows her to show her talents, because they were not on display here.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful piece of storytelling; superb acting. Powerfully transports you to another time and place and let's you feel like you can be a part of it all--in some small way.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|This movie reminded me of invasion of the body snatchers if it were mildly reimagined.  The similarities are too great. Aliens come to earth and take over humans and basically simply replace them, they dress like humans, do the same jobs that the peope they replaced were doing before, etc.
B005S9ELY4|4.0|This movie has a fantastic cast. It's an interesting enough movie but I've seen better. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have great chemistry on screen.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I Thought the game was just not for me and uninstalled it after a week.  If you are more of a comic book/ Iron Man movie fan than I am then you might enjoy it more.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have to admit, when I was reading the book, I didn't realize it was the last in the series. If I had, perhaps I would have had a different mentality towards it but there have been much better books in the Sookie Stackhouse series and I thought it was a pretty weak way to end such a long series. Nothing happened. So much stuff happens in all of the other books that this one just seems like a dud. Normally, I would blow through these books in a matter of three days, but this one took about a month to finish because I just couldn't pick it up. No intrigue.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|Totally love this cd. Even my girls like it. They love singing and dancing to the music. Its so great!!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I like musicals and would recommend if you like drama and musicals you would like this show. It had good acting.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very engaging. The graphics are first class and the puzzles are challenging without being ridiculously hard. Had a hard time putting it down!
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Its overly pretentious, boring, and lacks any redeeming quality. The fact that so many people like this movie completely blows my mind. The plot is unorigional, the primary relationship is poorly defined, the main character acts like an idiot who cant respond to simple question or converse at even the most basic level. If you want to stare at the side of someones face for an hour in silence while they drive around doing nothing buy this movie. Alternatively you could drive in a big circle to nowhere with your most boring acquantance and you'll have way more fun than you would by watching this movie. The epitome of style over substance. Arthouse flick? More like craphouse flick.
1781162646|5.0|I read other writers and I think they are pretty good.  After reading a Stephen King book everything else seem terrible in comparison.  Joyland is King at his finest.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I loved the whole series I would love to read it again I cant beleive it ended so good it was cool
630463949X|5.0|Wow, how fun is it to see you favorite band perform your favorite music. You sense the intensity of Stevie singing to Lindsey.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I downloaded this game onto my Kindle Fire and I find myself playing it when I should be vacuuming or unloading the dishwasher. My chores can wait until I complete the course on the hard setting!
B0007TKNII|5.0|My absolute favorite play ~ this is such a good telling of a remarkable story ~ we all have phantoms in our lives ~ do we see them
B0076HLKO0|5.0|if you love foo fighters than you will love this movie.  great chronicle of their career and how they came to be.
076781326X|5.0|I took my grandson to see this play live ~ he loved it, sang many of the songs, so was delighted to find it to gift to  him.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|We live on a busy street with lot's of cars zooming past the bedroom window even late at night. By using this APP I did see the potential of creating some sorts of white noise which would focus me to sleep rather than getting awakened by sudden noise from fast loud vehicles zooming past the window. I love this White Noise Ambiance app for solving that noise problem. It helps me fall asleep comfortably. The user interface is well done and lot of customization possible and blending your own sounds are possible. Put your Kindle for charging and let this APP run and fall asleep comfortably. Five stars from me.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Not being really big fans of the comic book genre, we were familiar with some of the characters, and were glad to be filled in on most of the background of the others.  The production was very good, and the action was always moving forward....good for an action flick.  It exceeded my expectations.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|ANOTHER GOOD READ FORM SPARKS. I HAVE READ AND LOVED ALL OF HIS BOOKS. VERY TOUCHING. AS USUAL, YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A KLEENEX NEARBY.
B0009P5YXO|1.0|This was a gift for my son. It did not work.  We tried a fresh set of batteries other than what was included and it still did not work.  Returned it and will look elsewhere for one.
B003B02O14|4.0|I LIKE ALMOST ALL OF JOHN GRESHAM'S BOOKS. THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM HIS OTHERS. IT KEPT ME GUESSING AS TO HOW THIS GUY PULLED ALL OF THIS TOGETHER. BUT IN THE END, WAS IT WORTH IT?
B0063GORYU|5.0|Sometimes it is a bit easy and you think you can beat the system, then it all changes and you are really struggling<br />Good game have recommended it to my friends.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Another brilliant tome by Sanderson. I'm a recent fan, and can't describe how much I enjoyed reading this book. The only negative is I have to wait for the next installment. This was a real page-turner, and I found it hard to put down. Sanderson is truly a gifted writer and I can see why Jordan trusted him to complete the Wheel of Time series.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is definitely one of my favorite shows over the last two years.  I love the cliffhangers of each episode
0670034711|4.0|The book was in very good condition just as the description said and arrived within the week of ordering the book. There was a small issue that was quickly resolved. They were really efficient and helpful.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Why did I wait until 3 season in to start watching this. Great show, can't wait until next season comes out.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series really touched the realist in me. They were dirty, got scared, made bad choices... Made the impossible more possible.<br /><br />We need more writers like this.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I love the super hero movies and this was very well done. Good story line and great action. A bit slow at times, but helped to move the story along.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This app and subsequent game is perfect for walking New players through Magic's basic rules. I would like timer settings, however.
B00CFOXBX2|2.0|I was expecting a bit of a chick flick element, but my wife wanted to watch it. We both fell asleep and haven't bothered to watch the end yet.
140006922X|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth by Reza Aslan.  This is absolutely a great book.  It is evident that the author has done a superb job researching his subject.  It is one of the most captivating books that I have ever read.  In fact, I am ordering a few more copies for my family and friends.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game.wish they gave more tokens though.Love playing the different levels.waste way too much time playing .<br />Glad it's free. Nice they have slots too.
B005JABU82|5.0|If you're considering buying this, or any of the real grade line, do it.  You will be very pleased with the detail
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|The music is great, I would recommend it, especially if you liked the movie. It's upbeat, good quality, and clean music.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I did not know what I was going to hear and I really like Bruno Mars' creativity, musicianship and very, very generous vocals.
B003X1OLDA|5.0|Amazing! This very inclusive Camel's collection is one of the best and most interesting work of English Progressive Rock. I recommend this Anthology to those who are particularly fond of this music genre which is still my favourite!
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Army of Darkness is the third movie in the Evil Dead Series so you have to at least see Evil Dead 2 to understand whats going on. Evil Dead 1 was a horror movie but Evil Dead 2 tried to be more of a comedy and I like that approach better. Army of Darkness is even more comedy themed then Evil Dead 2 and that's why I love it so much. It has the best one liners in movie history, Duke Nukem pretty must stole all of his one liner's because they were so good. If you liked Evil Dead 2 then you're like this. I don't want to give away any spoilers so I just end with this \\"Hail to the king baby!\\".
B000002UAO|5.0|I bought this CD just for the song In My Life... This was the song my son and I danced to at his wedding... The lyrics were just perfect for it...
B001XUH69Y|2.0|This is yet another example of the superiority of Blu-ray over just about any streaming service out there.  With the Blu-ray version of Casablanca (especially the remastered version taken from a 4k restoration master), there are far fewer noticeable compression artifacts (usually in the form of macroblocking in darker areas of the picture, far less 8 bit video banding, and contrast and shadow detail are superior) and the advantage of DTS-MA lossless audio (after decompression, the original PCM audio studio track is left unaltered) rather than a lossy compressed track.<br /><br />You want the best version currently available for your collection?  Buy the Blu-ray disc version and forget streaming.
B00D02Z1EA|3.0|The album is good, but for me, personally, everything after &#34;Constellations&#34; seems to blend together and sound the same, no exception with this album. There are a few good, unique songs.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I have always liked the Beach Boys and love this album.  Their anniversary tour did not come to my city, so Now I can listen to it.
1423136802|5.0|So, my son read the series and told me that I needed to read these books. I really enjoyed the adventures of Percy Jackson and his friends and had a lot of fun reading the series. I think it is great for boys because of the high interest and main character being male. but girls will enjoy the series too. There is a lot of action and I could not put the books down.
0345803485|3.0|I purchased this book as a gift.  It was received in a timely matter and in good condition.  Hopefully, the recipient will enjoy it.
0451232852|5.0|I loved this book and everything I have read by Follett.  This is a must read which I have recommended to my daughters and friends.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|An easy five stars. I was stuck in a musical. Then I heard &#34;Valentine,&#34; which I proceeded to listen into oblivion. After a brief break from that particular song, I went and dug into the entire album, listening on headphones with my eyes closed and let Apple enchant me. Fiona Apple is a genuine artist, blatantly heartfelt in her songwriting, composition and performance. Nothing about this Idler Wheel hits my ears or my brain in the wrong way.
B00DU74U74|4.0|Never read the books. It dragged a bit but was entertaining. Good casting. Good acting made it believeable. I would reccomend.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Cute story - only trouble I had with it was that the actors' accents were a bit difficult to understand at times.  Otherwise very entertaining
B000FBJHZS|5.0|The book held my interest and took a lot of twists and turns<br />I recommend it for a good thiller read
B009GEAPYW|5.0|If your a fan of Batman this movie is for you. FYI; you must watch part 1and 2 to get the full story. Great movie.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|A very unique plot with many sun plots all kelp me lied to the book. I normally read non fiction but this was a great treat.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|This movie is perfect for all Batman fans ;lots of action with a fantastic story . Must see for all ages.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I have been an Anne Rice fan for years and when I purchased my Kindle I knew I needed to purchase the digital additions for my collection.  I saw this set and it was perfect.  Since this was a single &#34;book&#34; for the Kindle, which I wasn't a fan of at first, I was able to have all of my highlights in one place and to revisit names and places while I was reading with ease.  This added to my experience and enjoyment of the beginning of the Vampire Chronicles.<br /><br />If you plan on purchasing the complete series, I do recommend buying them all at once.  Amazon sells The Complete Vampire Chronicles 12-Book Bundle [Kindle Edition].  I did not research enough prior to my purchase of this three book set or I would've just bought the 12 book bundle.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Horrible book,  horrible series waste of time. Horribly written.  Plenty of plot changes because there are no rules to this \\"universe\\". Huge areas of the \\"country\\" devoted to single economies is just plain dumb. Premise is dumb and plays out horribly,  It's like Running Man \\"the movie\\" (not the book).  Save your lifespan and skip it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have not had the opportunity to watch this yet but I did watch the season on TV so I know how good it is.  I can't wait to sit down and watch it all once again.  Awaiting the third Season to arrive which I understand will be February 2014.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Horrible Book and the sad part is 20 years from now I'm going to meet women named \\"Katniss\\".  Don't bother reading it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Have not watched these DVDs yet but I did watch the first season on TV.  I came to the Game of Thrones late and when I did start watching it, was amazed at how good it was.  I was fortunate enough to be able to watch one episode after the other when I did discover Game of Thrones.  Our cable company is good and I was able to watch them for free but then of course I had to purchase the DVDs to puruse later.  Can't wait to sit and watch them all.  It's going to be a marathon weekend for me when I start.  Have the second season DVDs too and can't wait until the third season comes out.  Waiting anxiously for the next season to start.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book. Very inspiring and just a feel good story. A must read for your summer list for sure! Loved it!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I really didn't care for this product and took it off my Kindle.  You may like it and as it is free you can try it for nothing.
B0027MJU00|5.0|LOVE her books. They are books that I never can put down! I finish them in a matter of days! Read them!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It is easy to play, uses little of your battery power on your device. All you have to do is tape the cards you want to move and they move over to the correct stack. Once you've finished the game it will put the stack up top for you.
B003AVMUSG|5.0|my son had these as a child and loved them, so i now got a set for my nephew, it will be a great surprise bd gift.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I chose this rating because I loved the way she described katniss feelings and the way she described the senere
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Great movie very entertaining funny but touched on some serious issues as well, superb acting especially Jennifer Lawrence and Robert deniro
B00884GR0W|4.0|I love it but the regeneration for the entities  is a little too fast. I also wish I can ride the horses and there would be golems You could make and the equivalent of a Wither. New dimensions would also be nice. Other than that, GREAT! :)
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Fun. created an album that is both a feel good album as well as quite sad, reflecting the general feeling of their own age.<br /><br />Their lyrics speak of feeling lost, with little or no guidance, and the jaded views of many who had high hopes for life.  At the same time, they stress the hope, that things will get better.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This stupid stuff is dumb who ever made this kindle is stupid this stuff broke you can tell yo mamma to see the motto and put this review on the internet and like y'all said put this on a scale to 1 to 3. 1is we are stupid to make this broke kindle 3 is we are smart enough to make this kindle the people love our kindle then y'all said to pick the number in the scale so I pick 1 because y'all stupid to make this broke kindle done
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It starts a little slow and I wondered if I would even like the characters based on the intial descriptions.  But by the end, I was pulling for them to find the happiness that seemed just out of reach for so long.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love playing this game. It's a lot of fun and you can always play without having to use real money.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|With my girls already being My Little Pony Fans, this seemed like a perfect fit for them, and in this you get a full length feature and not just a short episode. In watching this I have to say that the creators did a great job combining two worlds and creating something magical for the viewer. My daughters loved the characters and caught on immediately that there were some connections between the friends that Twilight Sparkle had in the Crystal Empire and the alternate world, but the movie keeps you guessing somewhat on what will happen in the end. The plot was fun and engaging and you get easily drawn in and lose track of time when watching. Overall, this was a great movie for the whole family!<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
B00CXQL828|5.0|An album like this comes along once per decade - maybe. If you're a fan of straight ahead rock with atypical riffs and intricate bridges performed by some of the best musicians in the game, it doesn't get much better than this!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I watched this movie with my two daughters and they simply loved it! With music and some actors that they both know from the Disney Channel, they were drawn in from beginning to end. In watching this I have to say that though the plot was somewhat predictable, the music was fun and you get drawn into the relationships of the characters. There also is a grease/west side story-esque quality of the movie with the turf war between the bikers and surfers which was fun. You also get a lot of stereotypes placed on certain types of characters and I was able to have a great conversation about these after the movie was over with my daughters. This is definitely a throw back to some of the beach movies of the 1960's and though my kids never saw these, they loved this and know it will be one that will be watched over and over again (I have already been told as much).<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
140006922X|2.0|Some interesting information presented, and the author is certainly entitled to his opinions.  However, it seems that it would have been ethically appropriate for the author/publisher/advance reviewers to disclose that the author is a practicing Muslim, and that his historical conclusions about Jesus simply comport with traditional Islamic theology.  Nothing wrong with writing Islamic apologetics, but it seems rather deceitful to conceal that rather relevant fact.
B0016KJKIG|5.0|The sheath that I purchased is to replace the one that I normally use, which is worn out.  The original one had the velcro go bad and it wouldn't stay closed.  I also had to sew the loop back on the original one where it attaches to your belt.  I bought the sheath at a very good price, and it was at more door in just a couple of days.  Great service!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It still sounds like a great product and, no, I do not yet own it but people should know that the Netflix offer has been pulled due to the overwhelming response to the product. It doesn't affect my intent to purchase but buyers should be aware as the news just broke. Four stars is to keep from skewing the average with a non-review.    [...]
B0094BB4TW|1.0|You need to update the app!!!! Come on! The current version is behind (compared to the Google play and iTunes versions)
B009A87X80|5.0|It is a little hard to classify Eva Cassidy.  She was a jazz singer, but also much more.  If you like great singers, an Eva Cassidy CD is a must buy.  Audiophiles:  The sound is very good.
B00BSBUZT6|1.0|Can,t not play the Blue-ray video because its A region<br />I open the plastic so I can not refunded.<br />Its very bad !
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best book ever it contains action, romance, mystery, and many more you will be shocked so many times
B008N5UX9M|1.0|First, it's not for Maiden's fans. This is clear enough.<br />This is even not a metal album, though the CD cover looks so metal!<br />What a metal lion!? Just feel sleepy and sissy crying, especially the vocal is sooooooo weak!<br />The recording quality is not as good as Iron Maiden.<br /><br />If Steve could let her daughter be the vocalist, then maybe I can give 3 stars.<br />Now, 1 star is enough, or zero is better.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Music is fantastic and I think Dustin, Bob, Robin, Maggie and Glenn Close and  and all the lost boys are terrific . A famy favorite
B0081336FO|5.0|I love Sherlock!!!!!!!! If you have not seen it yet, you might as well get started! Wonderfully filmed and amazingly well written, puts it in place of my top five television shows that I could watch again and again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing game,  what else can I say about Temple Run 2 beside it is a great way to spend some time from a busy life.
B009186E3O|1.0|If life is about enjoying and squeezing time, I'd rather watch for the umpteenth time 1 video of the Beatles performing on the rooftop, than the whole Stones material. The best Rock'n'roll Band in the whole damn world were The Beatles. If people can't accept that, just take a look at this material and you'll be instantly convinced. Even they know it, as you can see the Stones playing Beatles tunes on this dvd.<br />I've seen great Rolling Stones material (even though even that was a rip off of what The Beatles were doing at the time), but this doesn't even come close. Waste your money if you're a Stones completist. I'm so glad I'm not.
B000002MUW|5.0|madonna lovers like me ,have to have this one,great voice,music to dance to,seceret is my favorite song so now I have it.Madonna has her own syle and voice that I love to listen to and dance to.Get this one!
B008NW1M4K|5.0|The book is definitely a good one. It is a great read, but for me, sometimes it was a bit creepy(in a good way). The way Vermes thinks himself into Hitler is intense. Yes, it is fun to plow through the book, wanting to know what happens next. There is also a serious side to it. To think that this guy was for real in my parents lifetime...being German born and breed myself, I must say it touched me deeply. Not sure how it would be in English. In German it is absolutely `as large as live!`
1847940323|3.0|I was required to read this book for a graduate class I was taking for my principal licensure. I found it to be very introductory. If you have never read a book on leadership or how to influence individuals then this will be a good book. If you are at a graduate level, this is probably going to be a lot of review.
B000063UR1|5.0|just watch it and cry for our planet!  This is the first environmental movie.  Bruce Dern's finest movie.  What a great flick!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|GREAT MOVIE. I can't for the next adventure. Robert Downey Jr. definitely sold the move by his quick one liners. Loved Hulk too. Clearly the most powerful!
B005LJK3AC|3.0|This movie had a great cast, and a base story that anyone who ever had a horrible boss could probably relate to. But the execution of the whole story kind of fell flat, it wasn't as funny as i thought it would be. Kevin spacey was great as the psycho boss, when he gave himself the new position and proceeded to tell people he'll only take 85% of the salary of the additional position.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Installed this on my Kindle Fire and it doesn't work at all. It just \\"clocks\\" forever and never loads. Is there a decent Facebook app for Kindle Fire out there anywhere, because this one definitely bites.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|With such high ratings I thought I'd really like this book. I didn't.  I think the book dragged on in many places. Some of it was ridiculous, a murder gene? Come on!  The author introduces some characters that would be interesting if developed, but weren't.  Too bad, had potential.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This came as a group purchase with The Lumineers and AWOLNATION.  Very happy with my purchase.  I would recommend all three CDs.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its so funny and enjoyable to play, and its time consuming, but in a positive way its great for the kids, but it has some violent things, but overall its a great game for anyone
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I watched the director's extended version.  It said it had 16 more minutes.  It seemed like it added more than that, but regardless, it made some things make more sense.  They should have never cut those things out of the movie.  They add a few more minutes to the very beginning that put things into perspective.  I think this version should have been the one shown at the movies.  I've seen this movie at least two dozen times.  Now that I own it... it will be A LOT more.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this game is great fun with hours of game play. trust me this game can be extremely hard because you have to change your technique every time you change disease type.

B008Y5OWMK|5.0|AFTER ALL THE THINGS I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS MOVIE OVER THE YEARS, I MUST SAY I WAS COMPLETELY CAPIVATED BY THE FILM.

0312611692|3.0|Author does not comprehend the whole world history but he analyzed in micro way.<br />If he has an eye to analyze macro way , he could have described the right reason<br />The right reason is in the Bible. Human beings start again from Noah's 3 sons.<br />Ham, Shem, Japheth. The Bible predicts their fortune that the descendants of Japheth were to destined to prosper<br />The author should have considered that fact as well, which should have written the book more impartially<br />Without the Bible, there is no clue to get and find why the West rule the East
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I purchased both the 6 LED and this 8 LED model.  While the 6 LED has more mounting options including an integrated hook, this 8 LED seems more than twice as bright.  That's because this 8 LED uses AA batteries vs. the AAA batteries in the 6 LED.  The overall appearance of this 8 LED is nicer as well.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Worth the 3.00 bucks! Played a lot of these types of games and this one was the best so far. Great job can't wait for the next chapter
0525953590|5.0|Having read Sean Carroll's previous book From Eternity to Here, and having thoroughly enjoyed it, I eagerly anticipated the opportunity to read this book. I wasn't disappointed. The title is interesting. It is not that the Higgs is at the \\"end of the universe\\" as if there was such a thing, but that it is located at the \\"explanatory end.\\" It provides a final piece of puzzle that helps us understand how ordinary matter in our world works at a deep level.<br /><br />Carroll first introduces us to some elementary particle physics theory, where we learn about quarks, leptons (electron, muon, tau particles, for example), bosons (photons, gluons, and the higgs), fermions (matter particles such as protons and neutrons) and what they all mean. This provides a nice introduction to the topic. He then segues into a discussion of the Large Hadron Collider. It is here that bunches of protons are smashed into each other by two beams going in opposite directions. The amount of data produced by these collisions is enormous. We are talking about collisions occurring 20 million times per second, each crossing producing dozens of collisions resulting in hundreds of millions of collisions a second - yikes!. This vast amount of data is filtered by something called a trigger, of which there are two levels. This data is then sent through a Worldwide LHC Computing Grid that connects computing centers in thirty-five different nations. Both the Internet and private optical cables are used to distribute this vast amount of data. This whole thing is incredible!<br /><br />After that brief insight into the working of the LHC, Carroll switches to theoretical concepts. We learn some information about quantum field theory, fields that result in the particles we detect, the Higgs field and its boson, and symmetry (what is local symmetry, connection fields, problems with symmetry and symmetry breaking, and the symmetries of weak interactions). This information helps us to appreciate the Higgs field and its importance to the Standard Model. We can now get into the events leading up to the discovery of the Higgs at CERN in the chapter appropriately entitled \\"Bringing the House Down.\\"<br /><br />Carroll then discusses the people and events leading to the discovery of the \\"Higgs mechanism\\". The story actually goes back to research on superconductors. Physicists Yoichiro Nambu and Giovanni Jona-Lasinio showed how spontaneous symmetry breaking (necessary in the Higgs model) could occur even if you weren't inside a superconductor but could also happen in empty space. Through the work of numerous physicists such as Jeffrey Goldstone, Phil Anderson, Francois Englert, Robert Brout, Peter Higgs, Gerald Guralnik, Carl Richard Hagen, Tom Kibble, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, John Ward, Steven Weinberg, and others I probably missed, the story of the discovery of the \\"Higgs mechanism\\" became a permanent part of history. This history might be a bit difficult to follow for the non-expert, but it gives you an idea of how the work of many individuals contributed to an understanding of the matter.<br /><br />Carroll then discusses things beyond the Higgs, such as, the early universe, WIMPs, the hierarchy problem, vacuum energy, dark energy, supersymmetry (here we have five Higgs instead of one), strings, extra dimensions, branes, and the multiverse. He concludes the section saying that \\"Discovering the Higgs is not the end of particle physics. The Higgs was the final piece of the Standard Model, but it's also a window onto physics beyond that theory.\\" The Higgs will be important in the understanding of dark matter, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and whatever is to follow. This is the beginning of a new era.<br /><br />I want to also mention the three appendixes that provide more in depth information on the nature of mass and spin as they relate to particles, the Standard Model particles themselves, and their interactions. This is a welcome addition for those who want a more detailed discussion of the theoretical concepts. One note, however, there is a misprint of The Particle Zoo table on page 294. The masses and charges are correct, but the quark (top, bottom) and lepton (Tau, Tau neutrino) labels were repeated. You can easily find the correct table on the Internet. In addition, Carroll provides two full color panel sections with pictures of the key people involved, the LHC, and some data charts showing the Higgs discovery - very nice.<br /><br />I love Sean Carroll's books. I think I'll add him to my favorite authors list.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I feel negligent in my music collection with not owning this CD.  I have to recollect my record/tape collections slowly but how could I have forgotten this!  Thanks.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|One of the better ones with many of the familiar characters on Harry's home turf, Oslo. Once again well written and the use of multi views keeps you guessing.

B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I have become addicted to this series. Not the best but still very well done. Nesbo weaves the plot to keep you on your toes and send you off in different directions. Well written and crafted.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was so drawn into the suspense of the story that I couldn't stop watching until I had watched every episode.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I can't believe I missed this when it came out, and then I never heard about on DVD.  Not sure where I was...but I've seen it now and it's just fabulous.  Very enjoyable, cute, action packed.  Bruce still has IT, and for that matter, so does Ernest Borgnine!!  RIP.  I have loved Ernest B. since Ice Station Zebra (1968) and Escape From New York (1981).  So glad I got to see him again.  All the actors in this movie are most beloved and terrific actors.  This is well worth watch.  I have a 48 hour rental, so I think I'll watch it again tomorrow.  Thanks.  Oh, and I can't wait to see RED 2!!
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|I don't care what anyone says, Witherspoon & Pheonix portray Johnny & June immaculately. Amazing movie, fantastic acting & beautiful singing!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington is my favorite American actor.It is always a pleasure to watch his performances and it was not different with \\"Flight\\".<br />The film is  really one of the best that I've seen in a long time. As thrilling (or absurd?) as the plane crash can be, do not expect to see a Disaster film, though. It is the refusal to accept his alcohol dependence and the subsequent moral dilemma consuming the main character that leads the plot, making you wonder what is he going to do about.You cannot help taking his side no matter how wrong the idea of an aircraft with 102 people under the command of a person who has consciously consumed drugs and alcohol can appear. To be an extraordinary pilot, skilled enough to save so many lives, should be what counts in the end, drunk or not drunk. And yet, what is intrinsically wrong tortures our hero, as it should. And maybe this is why he is, indeed, a hero.

B0060MYK7G|5.0|The Borgias is a Showtime drama set in late 15th century Rome. The specific focus of the show concerns Rodrigo Borgias' ascent to the papacy and his efforts to stay in power through the turbulent events of the period.<br /><br />The show commences in 1492, the year that Alexander VI became Pope. Of course, most people will also recognize that year as the same in which Columbus discovered the New World. This date therefore provides an easy connection to the historical timeline that most people can easily relate to. Once Borgia becomes Alexander VI, the saga begins, and the show describes the machinations made to maintain Alexander six on the throne. This is a difficult and sometimes brutal history, and those that are familiar with this history will not be surprised at the events that unfold in the subsequent episodes. The show is largely historically accurate, both in the broad brush strokes and also in some of the minute details.<br /><br />There is little reason to repeat the expensive information that has already been written about this series including the specific detail covered in each episode. We can easily echo, however, the extremely high-quality production values of the show. We can also echo the view that the acting in the show is extremely well done. As companies like Showtime and HBO and Netflix continue to make extremely lush, well-developed dramas, we see that this move has now become the pinnacle of television production at this current time, one that is now rivaling, and sometimes, surpassing full screen movies. This is also the case with The Borgias. This is a show that is supremely well done, and it shows in every scene. The art sets, the costumes, the colors, the settings, and on and on are superbly well done. In fact, it seems we are watching here something of a quality level that would not even normally be seen in a full screen movie.<br /><br />The acting, of course, is of greatest importance, and we see with an outstanding cast including Jeremy Irons that the cast are up to every bit of the task and make the story come alive on the screen. It has been rumored that the show cost Showtime approximately $2.5 million per episode to make. That runs out to roughly $25 million per season. When you watch the show on a high definition television BluRay player, you can see where some of that money was spent. The show is lush, lavish, and it makes one marvel at how such shows are being made  today. Filming was carried out primarily in Hungary, and there is some use of CGI and certain scenes, but these are barely noticeable, and in fact sometimes are not noticeable at all. The architectural backgrounds to many of the scenes are simply superb, even when they are CGI.<br /><br />The Borgias had a loyal following for the first three seasons on Showtime. However, in a trend that we have heard all too often before, ratings were not as high as Showtime had hoped, particularly in Season Three. The show was originally slated for a four season run, but because the ratings were slightly disappointing in Season Three, Showtime decided to cancel the series at the end of the third season. This means that the planned Season Four of The Borgias does not exist, and likely will never be made. (This is not unlike the situation that occurred with the critically acclaimed show Boss, starring Kelsey Grammer, which was canceled after two seasons because of low ratings, but was considered to be one of the best drama shows put on television in recent memory.) But in spite of the disappointment that no Season Four is to be made, this is no reason not to watch The Borgias and to follow those first three seasons as they are made. (The same is true of Boss, as well; watching its first two seasons can be an amazing experience, in spite of the truncated ending of the show.)<br /><br />The Borgias is an excellent historical drama that will help you to learn much about the period, and the papacy of Alexander the sixth. It has some difficult scenes, but the show has seemingly done a reasonable job of attempting to portray the story without making it so consistently brutal that one would not wish to watch it. Watching the show in Blu-ray format with a high-definition television can provide some of the sharpest clearest and most colorful presentations that we've ever seen.<br /><br />This is an easy five-star recommendation for anyone enjoying historical dramas, or for those interested in the period., but the show has seemingly done a reasonable job of attempting to portray the story without making it so consistently brutal that one would not wish to watch it.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is an ok game when u r BORED other than that it is not the game I would play all the time
B00129H7VS|5.0|We have been waiting for this item to go down in price for awhile. This was a perfect gift for my husband and I am glad it was reasonable. Thank you!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Great story, awesome graphics and fun puzzles. It's worth the $3 I paid. The hints don't spoil the game by giving away too much if you need a little help. Fun!
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|I love this album, the beats are cool. I love the songs on the album. I think this is her best album yet. So glad I spent extra money to get it on the pre-order date to my house! So happy.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this movie. I love it. It is from the lady who did Twilight. The idea that aliens come to Earth and try to merge with their human hosts in a good way sounds almost like a Star Trek idea. Everyone getting along peaceably. There is no war, hunger. Everyone has resect for each other. No drug problems or drug wars. But you need to listen to the conversations with the female lead character and her host. It really makes the movie. I was glad to see a female be the lead or main character in the movie. If you like silver cars, motorcycles, helicopters and white clothes you will love this movie. I can't say too much more or I will give away all of the movie but I bought it just by the TV ads and it was money well spent. I am glad it is in my dvd library.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|While I'm not usually a fan of time-travel tales, this book is much more than that.  As always, character development and story-telling in Steve's books takes precedence.  Obviously there was a tremendous amount of research involved, revealing details that I had not previously been aware of and some of which I followed up on my own.  I have a hard copy of the book, as I do all of the others, but also bought the Kindle version for the ease of reading it.  I enjoyed the book very much.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not really my cup of tea but It's an okay game, something to help pass time. My kids like it
B009RH9HDS|5.0|This is my second marware products item.. I used one on my original fire.  Both worked fine and are still operational.  I cannot recommend this product any higher they are great!!
B0032KLAKE|5.0|This was a pretty great movie, one of Norton and Gere's finest performances of each of their career. That was not, however, my best run-on sentence. Whatever- you get the idea. It's kind of like a super-creepy, exquisitely detailed version of Law & Order SVU, but without Benson or Stabler, or the really tall guy who constantly bends sidewards to talk & his midget girlfriend.<br /><br />Gere is believable as is Norton, and by the middle of the movie, I was so confused and caught up, I had no idea what the heck was going to happen.<br /><br />Pop some popcorn- you'll be on the edge of your seat! (unless you talk to someone who watched this movie in the 90's or whatever. So, don't do that).
006178480X|5.0|I am a huge James Rollins fan + this book was no exception. Once I picked it up, I read until I couldn't keep my eyes open.<br />The next day I played hookey from weekend errands in order to finish it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this version of Solitaire!  Absolutely the best one on the market!  I play it every day and even right before I go to bed at night to relax!  Crazy but it does!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Without writing a spoiler, I would just like to say that I was disappointed with aspects of this season. It feels like it's starting to slip into a predictable formula. I might give the beginning of next season a chance, but they are losing me :( Costumes and cinematography are still lovely though.
B0040X46TE|5.0|Has several popular songs.  Izzy has a captivating voice.  The song all have the magic of Hawaii.  Great album for all ages.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Absolutely fun and challenging!  This game is a great way to engage your brain while having a blast.<br />Keep spinning out new levels!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|ordered it to see it so when my husband wants to go to the theatre I will know what the first was
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it! But don't know how to craft? Help! Also, really educational for kids<br />Because the stuff u make in it is how u make stuff in real life!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very addictive game,  me and my wife are both addicted,  well done keep up the good work,  really well thought out game,  cant wait to see more
B00A285OOW|3.0|I wanted to like this book more than i actually do, really. But Philippa Gregory disappointed me a little with her extremist interpretation of the start of the Tudor dynasty. Every other (fictional ) account of Henry VII shows him as mild-mannered and detached husband who even though he doesnt marry for love, he is NOT a rapist. To me this along with the author's portrayal of how Elizabeth and Henry came to love each other is most disturbing. I'm ususally a fan  of Gregory with her dramatic take on historical events but this time i think she pushed it too far with the rapist angle. I did enjoy the story of Perkin Warbeck...but along with young Henry VII, i wish i saw more of each respective character! One thing i saw too much of was Elizabeth's complaints and despairs though. Elizabeth; You are the QUEEN, not Margeret. Find your power and USE it for once. Please.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My six year old daughter loves it! Keeps her entertained for hours. Except now she wants a real horse! Good job!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is amazing to see dragons upgrade and breed and walk around in their little habitat. To see the eggs hatching for your Dragon.
145210655X|2.0|I wish I could get my money back. There is no storyline just a bunch of cute illustrations and thats about it.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|This works well. If you require to hear things that the ordinary ear cannot hear then get one and enjoy.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|It's funny, cute, and VERY entertaining! Good for both kids and adults. My little one broke the first copy I had so I've already bought it twice!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I could not put it down,  I wanted to read it all the time.  i finished it in 3 weeks.  wow, it was wonderful,  I am on the 4th book now
1451695195|3.0|I bought this to see what all of the fuss was about. I'm a medium myself and have read other books, such as the ones by Dr. Michael Newton, that made much more sense to me as to what it is like on the other side.<br /><br />This book had a lot of filler about his rare illness, rather than explaining the &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;. I actually found myself dissapointed and I never bothered to finish it. Dr. Newton's books are much more riveting and explanatory.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This was a perfect purchase for me. I got the exact CD I asked for in brand new condition. The CD works perfectly and I got it in the mail promptly.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|Love this really going to miss these characters, dont know if there will be any more, seasons dont think so. keifer sutherlands best work yet
B004YF6MHW|5.0|i have bought several photo apps, but this one is so easy to use, and more options, i will use it a lot
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Great graphics, fascinating game, but whatever is wrong with it brought my operating system down on my Kindle Fire HD.  I had to call Amazon for help, and they told me to delete this game and reinstall, even though I had deleted  once, and reinstalled (thinking it was just a bad install).  The reinstall did not help it.  Playing this game for any length of time will bring the OS down, and it won't restart.  I finally deleted the entire game off my Kindle.  Have had no problem since.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|Very buggy, especially as you go up the levels. I wish they would put out a fixed version. Okay otherwise.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I thought it was a Google search app, but come to find it, all it finds is apps on your Kindle.  Not what I had in mind!
B000209ZAE|2.0|Like many of the other reviewers I was prepared for problems when the package arrived and I heard the clanking sound of loose metal parts before opening the Amazon/Proxxon boxes.  Fortunately no missing or broken parts, but a clue that this was not a top notch product.  I purchased the stand to drill holes in beach glass using the Proxxon rotary tool equipped with hollow core diamond drills from Rio Grande supply.  Two features were especially important in my plan for using the drill stand:  first, sensitive response to hand operation (smooth, non-binding) and second, easy return to start position.  Out-of-the-box performance failed on both accounts.<br /><br />Using the suggestions of another reviewer, I first tried to smooth the response of the mechanism as the lever was depressed.  I started by applying \\"Super Lube, Synthetic Grease\\" to the machined surfaces that move along the vertical steel post.  I also added lubricant to the other moving/binding components.  Eventually I could activate the lever and the mechanism would move smoothly without binding.<br /><br />Next I wanted the mechanism to return to its start position without needing to add any additional restoring force on the actuation lever.  Without the rotary tool installed, that functionality followed after I greased the bushings and other components.  However, once I inserted the rotary tool into the drill stand holder, the spring did not have sufficient restoration force to return the mechanism to its starting position.  This residual binding was most likely the result of the extra weight of the tool and its cantilever action. The mechanism would hang about 1/4\\" from the starting position.  The solution to this problem was to pre-load the spring mechanism by inserting a 1/4-20 bolt (hex head, 2\\" long) beneath the olive color fork mechanism holding the spring. That was sufficient pre-load for the spring to return the mounted rotary tool to the start position determined by the 1/4-20 bolt.<br /><br />In the end, I wonder why a generally reputable company like Proxxon would release such a poorly packaged and operationally deficient product.  For a little more effort this unit could have been designed and manufactured to the quality level of the Proxxon rotary tool.
B0055SWM08|3.0|Not my cup of tea, as they say.  A little boring, but if for a younger person just learning games it may be helpful? It is simple at first, but gets progressively harder.
B0052REUW0|5.0|What can one say when every t is crossed and every i is dotted and every possibility is discussed. The case Pinker makes is a strong one. The writing is excellent. Another timeless masterpiece from Pinker who turned my thinking 180 degrees on the subject.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|This game doesn't go very far, and you have to wait a week to get new ones.  Five games at a time, no levels, etc.  Not at all like the original.
B006VJMZXY|3.0|While I love historical fiction and have read most of Phillipa's books, I found The Kingmaker's Daughter repetitive and predictable in parts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I've read all year. If there's one thing I love in a novel, it's good character development - and this book definitely delivers. Howey tells a story of a harsh post-apocalyptic dysopia through the very human experiences of the characters.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Without getting to deep into the story I just wanted to say I really enjoyed the book. It has a nice twist to it. If you like this genre you are going to have trouble putting it down. I would recommend.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|And one which is hard to put down. The storyline begins very simply but then continues to expand page by page. The reader is kept enthralled by the very real characters introduced and the highs and lows of Harold's journey. The end is fitting. I enjoyed the book very much.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie is quite good, but definitely needs to be considered on it's own merits instead of compaired to the book.  The story moves along well, and keeps your attention.  I certainly didn't find the violence gratituous or excessive, but it is there and should be considered when young children are viewing the movie.  Some of the impact and charm of the book is missing, but again, on it's own merits, it's a great movie and a good story.
B001MBK3T4|5.0|Quite possibly Black Sabbaths best effort. Dio's vocals are at their peak here. Tony and the whole band are at their best and have written one amazing song after another. The whole album rocks! A must have album for sure.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is great for my 4 &amp; 7 year old kids! they love it!it is amazing for little ones who love the movie finding memo. you can build reefs for other fish and for yourself!
B000O5B5FK|5.0|I love this band. This is one of their best cd's. I have most of them and they are all good. Great band.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I really enjoyed watching these appealing actors having a great time with a slightly amusing story.  I can recommend this movie to people who like watching Bruce Willis be Bruce Willis and John Malkovich hamming it up with a marginally believable character. I was a little uncomfortable with the barely developed love story between Willis and Mary-Louise Parker, but I guess she was included for youth appeal.  It was fun to watch on a Sunday morning lying in bed.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Everyone of their cd's are great. This is one of my favorite bands. They are a joy to listen to.
B006H3MJ7G|5.0|Yes.. I'm obsessed with this album.. It's so perfect and I really enjoy dancing to it.. It's my go-to CD..
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun but a little difficult at times. I don't like the fact that if you leave the game you must start the level over again.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|Very fast shipping and well priced Blu Ray and DVDs on season 2 big bang theory.<br />I enjoy the show very much. Thank you!

0765325950|3.0|I feel like I've been punched in the stomach.  The wind is completely out of me, I'm gasping for breath, and I feel surprised and hurt.  Part of this is due to the fact that a series I've been following since I was in middle school is now over, part of it is because it didn't resolve anything for me.  But anyways, I need to through my usual spiel of this being part of a series.  This is the fourteenth and final book in the Wheel of Time series.  Start at the beginning if you wish to tackle this mammoth collection of words, do not start at this book.<br /><br />The Last Battle is here.  Everyone who can fight is and they are holding back the forces of the Dark Lord.  Rand, meanwhile, has gone to face the Dark One, confident in his ability to destroy him forever.  Elayne, Egwene, Mat, Perrin and others all have their own duties and battles to fight.  Something must remain if Rand wins his battle, and they have to keep people alive.<br /><br />I don't know what happened to my beloved characters in this book.  Sanderson was doing so well with them (excepting Mat) that it seemed odd he would switch them up at a time like this.  They were all shells of their former selves.  Perrin was probably the best overall.  He at least had interesting things to do and they were believable based on the previous actions of his in the series.  Mat, well he's still a gambler, still the comedian, but it's forced and like the previous two books, just not in line with his character as Jordan created him.  Egwene was ok, I was disappointed with where the book took her plot-line but at least she's as strong as she's ever been.  Aviendha and Min had minimal roles, so I'm still not sure if I'm pleased with their performance or not.<br /><br />This book was mostly battles.  Sure, they were well done descriptions of battles, but it wasn't what I expected a nine-hundred page book to be dominated by. Some unfinished business was resolved, but a lot of it was still open.  And the ending?  Well, let's just say that it felt incomplete and wrong to me.  But I won't give away any more than that.  Compared to the other two books that Sanderson co-authored this one lagged a bit in pace because of all those battles.  I think a lot of it was extraneous and could have been cut out to provide more time for the important resolution of the series type of writing.  We were so eagerly waiting for the end of this series, that it is easy to see why a lot of people would be disappointed by a lot of things.  But I do think that a lot of that disappointment could have been avoided by better paying attention to Jordan's tone of the original books.  That was something that just wasn't in this one.<br /><br />I'm probably going to go bury myself in another book just to escape the release of emotions this one gave me.  I'm sorry it's over and I almost wish I wouldn't have read the last book so I could still have my own ending in my head.  But at least I have some sort of ending.<br /><br />A Memory of Light<br />Copyright 2012<br />909 pages<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2013s just say that it felt incomplete and wrong to me.

Love the whole progression the author is sharing with us.<br />Tricks, References, Big names and side stories.<br /><br />Convinced me I wasn't hopeless with memorising.

B00D6OV57O|5.0|Incredible how Hans ZIMMER can create another outstanding soundtrack<br />I was a little bit concerned with the soundtrack before watching the movie as I'm a John WILLIAMS fan (Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones...) but again, Hans ZIMMER did an amazing job once again
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If I could give Zealot more than 5 stars I would.  This is an intellectual book that needs to be embraced by the communities who all consider Abraham their father ... this includes the Christian, Jewish and Islamic communities.  What Aslan write is the truth.  There is no denial that Jesus did live ... we can look at the history of our first century Jewish brothers and sister who revere Jesus as a very gifted Rabbi ... probably a Pharisee ... who had wonderful and great teachings.  For those who talk about the Gospels being accounts of Jesus let's look at this carefully.  The earliest Gospel, Mark, was written in the late 60s CE ... probably during the period Peter and Paul were imprisoned in Rome.  The stories that are related in Mark were oral histories of the walk and life of Jesus.  As much as people cannot seem to get their heads around it, there was no CNN, FOX, MSNBC, New York Times or USA Today walking around behind Jesus writing and capturing his every word.  Many seminarians believe Mark was an oral Gospel that was written many years later and possibly by a woman.  The same thing goes for the 3 other Gospels ... Matthew, Luke and John.  And between Matthew and Mark there is a great deal of plagarism from Mark and from a source which theologians and scholars refer to as Q.  So what I have read in Dr. Aslan's outstanding work is in line with what I was taught in 3 years of seminary studying at the feet of one of the best New Testament scholars in the nation.  Also for a clear understanding of who Jesus was ... in addition to the one provided by Dr. Aslan  ... check out the volumes written by Dr. Amy Jill Levine who is a New Testament Professor at Vanderbilt ... and did I mention she is a Jewish daughter of Abraham.

B008GOGB6Y|5.0|I saw the movie about 30 years ago and it still ranks in my favorites<br /><br />Just a real  view into  low and high income people and the low ones come out as so much more  real and honest and fun.<br /><br />The star is a real star- hecarries the movie with his optimism.<br /><br />There's nothing to dislike about it and there's so much to remember afteer 30 years. I strongly recommend it.<br /><br />Ciao papa!
B0038Z5SEW|3.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only, and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray transfer of The Edge offers increased clarity and detail over the DVD.  That is what you want with a movie like this, which was filmed in the great outdoors of western Canada.  Unfortunately, the color saturation is a bit weak.  Skin tones look washed out.  As far as the sound goes, it played loud and strong on my system.<br /><br />If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, I think it is worth it.  But this edition would have benefitted from richer colors.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|The movie is good. The story line is not as substantial as part two. But this one is certainly better than part three!
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Good story line without all the teen angst and hokiness of the Twilight series. The lead male was a little immature, but then most boys are.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I cannot believe the connection I feel with this book. I cannot wait to see where this journey goes and ends.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love this book! This is a great love story/sports/ and just down to reality book!!! WOuld totally read this again!
B00C1C188I|5.0|This is a really good prequel to the original “The Thing” that shows how it all got started. The film makers paid special attention to show us how what we saw in the original movie such as that burned monster outside the Norwegian camp, the frozen guy who killed himself, the ax in the wall, the block of ice they cut out, and the dog running away from the helicopter…among others. Check it out!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love this book. I love Tina Fey. This is a great book! I would reccoment this to anyone wanting to read something funny!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Good story, interesting characters, great sets!, and leaves you always wondering what will happen next. Only complaint is that like most of HBO’s work it is full of unnecessary nudity and sexual content that really enhance or help the story move along. It’s what you get from them though so either put up with it or watch something else.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have this on my iPod touch, my Samsung galaxy II and now the kindle fire HD. It's fun and I think it is very fair compared to other games using gems or coins. As someone who knows a little about taking care of horses already I can also say it is fairly accurate.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|North by Northwest has it all, comedy and mystery. My husband and I loved this movie!  We highly recommend it!
0446556750|4.0|The Reversal by Michael Connelly once again brings together LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch and defense attorney Mickey Haller, but this time they're on the same side, working together to send a once-convicted child murderer back to prison. Chapters alternate between Haller's first person narrative and the omniscient narrator's account of Bosch's movements. This is a style Connelly has used before and it keeps the story moving swiftly through investigations surrounding the case as well as the thrilling courtroom maneuverings. Connelly delivers a fast-paced ride and a joy to read from first to last as usual, while also managing to expose some of the confusing, contradictory inner workings of the justice system.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I didn't know anything about the story line, even after seeing trailers.  All I knew was there was this girl that was an archer.  My daughter lent me her book to read, which I read very quickly (kind of a &#34;can't put it down&#34; type), and even though the whole premise of the plot is a little disturbing, I still wanted to see the movie.  Quite astonishingly, it followed the book almost to a tee!  There where a couple of things that were different, but not really enough to set off the original story line.<br /><br />A wonderful action packed movie, although I would research the plot before watching, as it might be too disturbing for your taste.
0060557818|5.0|Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman creates an amazing world that seems utterly plausible. It is a rare fantasy novel that feels completely real - I was halfway through this book when it finally dawned on me that I was, in fact, reading a fantasy novel - something which I seldom do. Gaiman's prose carries the reader along at a breathless pace and each character he introduces is somehow even more interesting and engaging than the last. The world of fantasy is the one Neil Gaiman is best known for inhabiting, but the bottom line is that he is, without question, a great storyteller.
B0011NVC98|2.0|When I watch cartoons I watch cartoons,like Incredibles for instance ,.When I purchase this movie I was under the impression that I will watch really actors. I guess I was wrong!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I don't play around with Apps a lot, but this game is addicting.  In a time where we spend tons of money buying games for Nintendo, Play Station, or X-Box it's nice to see a fun game available at no cost.<br /><br />Of course you can spend money on this game, but I don't know why you would, it's not necessary to have fun.  I enjoyed the game and I think anyone who's a fan of the Despicable Me series will also enjoy it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I liked this so much I bought 40 hard copies to share.<br /><br />Calm and inevitable, it has the profound charm of Albert of Adelside
B005IT0V8O|4.0|Replaced older, missing copy.  Have read this one over and over, and need to keep one handy for the whole family.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A nice finish to the series- suspenseful, heartbreaking, yet still optimistic despite all the hardship.  I hope the eventual movie does it justice!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its free, its got great graphics. The sound bytes and extras are awesome. Love this game. Got to get more friends to try this.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|this flash works better than expected.  I have used external flashes before, but never really liked them.  I think this one works for me because it is so simple.  Just turn it on and go.
006207993X|2.0|dont know why this is so famous. nowhere near as florid or sumptuous as dandylion wine or fahrenheit 451 or that short story collection i can't remember.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|nice puzzle game with enough levels to keep you interested. Pretty good game considering it was a free app too.
0060900075|5.0|okay so you know how people try to describe drug trips and they think everything is so significant but it makes for a super boring story in the telling? Well Huxley here is a fantastic storyteller and he links his experience on mescaline to ecstatic poetry and religious experience and all these literary references and it's really brilliant and interesting.
B000TEPKGQ|5.0|I love this album. I paid 5 whole dollars and its,well worth it. It had all the good songs and more
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I made my 11-yr-old daughter finish watching it b/c it was $3.99.  Not sure which was worse, the movie or her constant pleas to PLEASE turn it off!  Not sure why this movie was made.  Terrible script, terrible acting.  If I knew how to give it 0 stars I would.  Plus, the sound cut out half-way through.
B005HSL626|2.0|It's ok. Can't really do a lot with this game. Kind of boring and not very entertaining. Waste of time
1781162646|5.0|Great read!  I could not put it down the last 50 pages; was up past 1 a.m. til I finished the book.  This is the Stephen King I like.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|seriously why is it so hard to understand  all of these fake candy crushes are not making people happy  just get the real thing and make everyones lives so much better  PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Addicting drama. Hard to stop watching. Never could watch regularly when it aired originally. Glad I finally got to watch the complete first season
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|My boys and I really enjoyed the movie. Nothing like having family time, sitting around watching a good movie. We have watched it more than once.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game was fun.  It wasnt that hard but kept you thinking.  My daughter and i both enjoyed the first ten levels.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I have having fun with the old school feel of the game combined with the more modern game plan aspects.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|This is one of Johnny's funnier moments of creative acting. He's an A list actor and never lets you down when doing a piece such as Benny and Joon. I love anything Johnny is in, he's is one of my favorite actors. Probably his resemblance to me Haha (not kidding)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I feel Greg because he might not ever get a girlfriend and I know that it will never EVER happen not to be mean though but it was a great book and YAY ROWLEY GOT A GIRLFRIEND
B00340I4KG|5.0|These two actors are prime watching. You can never go wrong with Travolta and Cage in the same movie. A must see!  Aja
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book!!! I felt like I was with him during the battle, darn near had a panic attack it was so intense. Much respect for these brave warriors and their sacrifices.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My &#34;adopted&#34; son and nephew were saved in the last few weeks. They are both in their thirties with young boys. I have this movie and it has been a blessing to me, so I wanted them to have it as well. It makes you realize exactly what is the most important thing in your life... your family.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I love Walk off the earth since over a year and this CD is the best CD I've ever listened to! I can recommend this CD to everyone out there!  They're just fabulous! I hope they'll have a lot of CDs in the future!

B00B89WXYS|5.0|I love the music on this CD. Great music for driving to work in the morning. I highly recommend it.
030758836X|4.0|The book is addicting and full of surprises, but the ending is disappointing in so many ways.  I developed such a strong hate for one of the characters,  and the ending had no sense of kharma at all!  The book is worth reading for the twists but prepare yourself to he dissatisfied in the end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best app ever it worth the 7 dollars but only if it had villages and doungens and revens and better mulityplayer but overall its a boss game
6305882592|5.0|This is one of those movies that I saw as a kid and just had to purchase. It holds up just as well as it did all those years ago. Fantastic characters and Ruth Gordon is brilliant (she could read the phonebook and it would be entertaining).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Like to play this when I have nothing else  to do during the day. It is fun. Wish there was a cheaper way to earn energy that way I wouldn't have  to use my gems or wait on it. Other than that it is very fun. My 1 yea  old likes it too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So many twists and turns i got to the last episode and wanted more. Can't wait till next season. ye-haw.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Lots a cool world war 2 gun app has realistic sounds but it needs to add more guns there are a little bit other than that it's worth it
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I am so sorry I purchase this item by mistake, thinking that it was the game Candy Crush.  I am so embarrassed!
B002SHD9E2|5.0|This opera brings me to tears and the music is inspirational! I love everything about this movie! I am so glad it came in HD!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A say you should do a change so that more people like this game and you should put more charecters and more skepors
B00BQBNK04|5.0|Worth every penny! This soundtrack brings me to tears very time I listen to a song. It is as if I am watching the movie. It has a very crystal clear sound!
B002VLNB1Q|5.0|john mayer is becoming my favorite artist. love this cd. he is awesome in concert too. love battle studies by john mayer.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Beautiful drawing and graphics. Absolutely love the music. I even have a song that I always hum to when it plays. Challenging and fun. Love the sound effects to. Only one question, how in the world are they edible and how in the world do they taste?
0143118706|5.0|It's a must read. I learned so much and have a more whole and happy outlook on marriage. Thank you Liz.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well realy it needs redstone fishing rods nether portels end portel better creitiv mode two<br /><br />And a longer world flat land and possibuly mods
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Can't wait to see Despicable Me 2. Nice family movie! Kids will love it. I loved it and I'm not a kid.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|If this a brief view into real life in North Korea, how sad.  Or is it a story?  All in all, not a normal read for me!
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|It started out interesting enough, but now has become a burden that I am trying, with all my might, to finish. I know all you ebook readers out there know what I'm talking about when I say- you know you have a good book when you look down at the % completed and you are almost done with it and you don't want it to be over! This book, I keep looking at the % completed and each time I can't believe what it says I'm no where near finished. This book has dragged on and I am not in love with any of the characters. I should just stop reading and move on to another, but I keep thinking...maybe it gets better in the next chapter? but it doesn't.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|i runs well and i use regularly. I am trying to find software for a PDA have a nice day
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The book is so well written.  The story is gripping.  A real page turner.  The characters are so real.  Don't miss this one!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Not 1 bad song.. A must have for any driver. This Is one of the best all around CD's I have brought in a long time!
B00BB22GSU|5.0|I've been a Vampire Weekend fan for a long time, I own all of their mp3s already and a CD. I have now purchased all of their albums on vinyl and I'm so pleased not only with the quality but also the fast delivery and perfection of vinyl itself.
B0010X758Q|5.0|I've been a Vampire Weekend fan for a long time, I own all of their mp3s already and a CD. I have now purchased all of their albums on vinyl and I'm so pleased not only with the quality but also the fast delivery and perfection of vinyl itself.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You have to get this game. That's all I am going to say because there is nothing else to say it's just that awesome.:)
B00957T6X6|5.0|Best series for science fiction/mid-evil aficionados.  Continuous entertainment & complex story lines keep the reader hanging on every chapter.  Excellent!
B001I45UFC|5.0|It was surprise after surprise! Excitement all the way. It was very similar to the movie, good job! Love it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter  and I play together and love taking  care of our horses! she loves seeing the unicorns. I like the mini game they have each day to earn more gems.
