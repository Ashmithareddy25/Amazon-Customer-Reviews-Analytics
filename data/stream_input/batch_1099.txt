0374290024|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment for me. Instead of the many hundreds of pages, Ian Morris could have presented his argument is only some pages. However, the reader will quickly get bored  and confused by his many graphs, data and all the other facts taken from many disciplines. Add the fact that I and many other readers on Amazon remain unconvinced by his thesis, which can easily be dismissed.  This book shows you that a fascinating topic can easily be ruined by a dry style of writing presented by an eminent academic. In short, not my cup of tea.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I've never written a review for a book BEFORE finishing it, but this book prompts me to do so. I'm a die-hard Castle fan; belong to forums and read all the latest Castle news. I finally got a tablet and downloaded the Kindle app; this was the 1st book to be downloaded.<br /><br />\\"I can't stop laughing while reading this book!\\", is the best way that I can describe this piece of fiction. I read every day but usually it's serious or suspence driven books. After devouring East of Eden, again, I needed something light hearted and relaxing to read. THIS book is it! Any fan of the TV show Castle has script memorized from the show, along with the personalities of the characters; you can NOT read this book without seeing Beckett, Castle and the Usual Suspects saying the lines. There are times that I am laughing so hard, I have to put my tablet down and wipe the tears from my eyes! Now....THAT'S a good read!<br /><br />As others have said, for me, it doesn't matter who is writing these \\"meta\\" books: if you love the show, you'll love this book. I truly can't remember the last time I laughed while reading a book; now that's sad. I guess I better download the next Castle tie in so I keep on laughin'!
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|I got this camera as a christmas gift for my son who just turned 3 years old.  He loved it!  It was easy enough for him to figure out how to navigate after only a few minutes.  The flash is slightly blinding after a while, but it's not a big deal.  I love that it is rechargable through USB to your computer and you don't have to go broke on batteries.  This camera is cute, and more than worth the money.  The picture quality is way better than I have found most children's cameras to have.  I would highly recommend it!
0439023491|5.0|I am actually not quite finished reading the end of this book yet but I just wanted to say that I'm so amazed at how much better this book is than Book One - I saw that the storyline & ideas were amazing in the first book & even though there were times when it seemed to get a little juvenile (but at the same time, very very adult!) I stuck with it & I am so glad I did.<br />For the record, I'm 34 years old with teenagers of my own so I was a little thrown back when, after beginning The Hunger Games I found out the series is categorized as Young Adult reading.  So anyway I just wanted to get the word out there that it DOES start to get really, really good!  I also just learned that a movie deal has been contracted, which is not at all surprising because you can totally see a  movie playing out as you read this captivating story.

B000BNX4MC|5.0|With the vast ocean of useless flicks being pumped out today by the film industries, it's a relief to find a charming, witty comedy that actually leaves you with a good feeling, and not the idea tha you just lost an hour and 45 minutes of your life to a pointless movie.    \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" is one of those movies. Granted, it's a little old, and a lot has changed since then. But this barely touches it comedic glory. With a perfect cast, a witty script, and a fun musical scene, this movie is one of the best I've seen in some time.    A young, handsome Matthew Broderick begins the story of Ferris Bueller, a popular, slick high school student who simply refuses to go to school on a beautiful day. Clearly the favorite child, Ferris milks an \\"I'm sick\\" day out of his charmingly oblivious parents (don't we all wish parents were like that?), grabs his best friend and his girlfriend, and heads out for the most exciting day of his life.    Without Broderick, the film would have fallen flat. His character could have come off bratty and insufferable if it weren't for the young actor's charm and heart. His best friend, the conastantly-worrying Cameron (Alan Ruck) is comedic gold, and his story arc is presented flawlessly throughout the story. Bueller's girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara) offers the other half of a whole for Bueller, keeping him grounded- or rather, as grounded as he can get. The trio make an excellent cast, and put all their effort forth to make the movie work. As the crooked-toothed \\"villain\\" of the movie, Bueller's principal obsessed with blowing his student's cover, Jeffrey Jones is genius. His character is hatable (is that even a word?) and yet we end up feeling somewhat sorry for the unlucky principal, who falls prey to Bueller's perfect plans.    The movie is just all-around charming. With a sequence of adventures all narrated by Broderick as he continually breaks the fourth-wall (something that simply adds to the film's perfection), we grow to care for all the characters and appreciate the stories tagging along, such as those of Bueller's hateful sister Jeanie, the secretary Grace, and a surprise scene showing us a young Charlie Sheen. It looked like the kind of fun, creative movie everyone enjoyed working on.    \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" is a unique movie that only comes around once in a while, the kind that truly deserves five stars. It's constantly clever, funny, and touching, and I loved it, as did audiences everywhere. It's a classic of the 80's, and the sort of movie that people will continue to watch- even in this day and age of 2011. I strongly reccommend it- because honestly, who can hate Ferris Bueller?
B0049GYXDG|3.0|This DVD will not be released until Tuesday - Feb 1st - But I want to alert those without DVD Players that - like Destino and other great material on the Fantasia/Fantasia 2000 release in December, there is NO BONUS material on the DVD copy included in this combo pack.

0316069906|3.0|So the meat industry is bad. And the fishing industry is bad. And the poultry industry is bad. What about the agricultural industry? Monoculture, desertification, agriculture for energy production? Oh, that's bad, too? So what's the solution? We all become vegans and hobby farmers? Millions of people in developing countries involuntarily live exactly like that and they can't wait to get out of it!    How are 7 billion to be fed without a food industry? How can the urban lifestyle Mr Foer obviously is completely immersed in even exist without it? The sentimental, philosophical questions used in the argumentations do sustainable food production a disservice. If people are animals and all animals are equal, then the value of the life of fish is the same as that of a child. This leads to a very strange and warped view of life, where news about the suffering of a dog makes bigger headlines than the death of children. I resent that.    Which isn't to say the arguments are invalid. To the contrary. The food industry definitely needs change, big change. The facts about the enormous amounts of bycatch being lost on the floating fish factories, the inhumane and unsustainable production of eggs, poultry, meat, etc. are shocking, no doubt. The entire industry needs an overhaul, and it is happening, but much too slowly and far between.    Now, what is at the CORE of all these problems? Eating meat? Eating fish? Not by definition, as far as I can see. From the proper source and in moderation these food sources have their place in human diet.     What if we learned to consume food more critically again? If livestock was kept in a sustainable fashion, with proper living conditions for the animals and slaughtered in a humane way? If fish was raised in fish farms in a similar manner? The cost of meat and fish would probably double, which would reduce the amount eaten, but improve the quality of the product. Same thing for agriculture. Sustainable farming today is expensive, rare andthus exclusive. Yet if it became the rule, it could still be an 'industry', but a good one, feeding all for many centuries to come.    The alternative, if your consistent, is an old-fashioned farming society. I don't want to go back there and I doubt that Mr Foer does.    Too much sentimentality and warped philosophy mixed into an otherwise well-researched and very important subject. It will affect the way the reader looks at cheaply produced meat and fish, which isn't a bad thing, but the person of Mr Foer often gets in the way of the message.

B002LC2DQ4|1.0|I bought a Olympus Camera a coule of months ago then went back to Amazon to purchase a flash memory card.  I read the blurb that said \\"Shoppers that bought this camera also bought the Olympus M+ 2 GB xD-Picture Card Flash Memory Card 202332.\\"  I trusted that the card would fit the camera and went ahead and bought it.  Turns out, it does not fit the camera I bought.  I had to call the manufacturer of the flash card to find this out.  They set me straight and sent me the correct card.  Though the \\"Shoppers that also bought...\\" function on Amazon is meant to be helpful, in this case it was misleading.  Not a great loss but definitely a hassle to return the card and get a new one.
B003L20IJW|5.0|This time Nanny McPhee has to come to the aid of an English farm family whose husband and father has gone off to fight in WW II. The movie starts with a lot of action and never lets up. The family's desperate financial situation is further complicated by the arrival of two spoiled rich cousins from London.<br /><br />The plot, dialogue, and humor are all aimed at the younger crowd so adults should be warned in advance to expect something for the children. Having said that, the children should be pleased and excited by the progress of the movie and even the adults may be satisfied with the way the movie ends.<br /><br />This movie delves more into the fantasy elements and demonstrates what miraculous things Nanny McPhee can do; most of these will delight the children even though they don't advance the story.<br /><br />If you have younger children at home, this movie may find an enthusiastic audience; adults will probably not find it as interesting. I gave it five stars for its likely appeal to young children.

B0043ISH6O|5.0|Another timeless and brilliant creation from Reznor. The music works so well within the context of the film and also on its own. Fits the movie perfectly with a style that touches on retro 80s computer/sci-fi music, but also something is darker at work that perfectly underscores all the tension, isolation, vulnerability, and anger that is portrayed in the film. The motivation all really comes down to the human aspect of it all - the pain he felt and didn't know how to deal with in the right way. The score is a perfect mix or juxtaposition of electronic and emotion, but we've always known that is what Reznor knows how to do so well.
B000001GRZ|5.0|Bach: 6 Suiten f&uuml;r Violoncello solo is a recording where one has the pleasure to hear the genius of Pierre Fournier at work. It was originally recorded on Polydor International 1961 and even though this recording is 50 years it sounds amazing. It is like Fournier completely understands Bach and the end result is that what Gould is for Bach on piano, Fournier is for the cello. Quite simply an amazing recording. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B003E8AF5U|5.0|I'll preface this review by saying that I love this album. I absolutely adore it, and I held off on it for a while because of all the poor reviews and that was a huge mistake. In a lot of ways, it's better than the first album. It's more mature, it's not really \\"weird\\" at all, nor is it particularly envelope pushing, I don't get why people think that. People have been making this sort of music since the '60s.    I understand why so many people dislike this album but also why so many also like this album. Part of it is that Oracular Spectacular was so accessible and appealed to such a broad base. If you liked the first album and you also liked Sgt. Pepper's or Pet Sounds, then you will love the sound that MGMT has on this album. If songs like \\"It's Working\\", \\"Something's Missing\\", \\"I Found a Whistle\\" don't sound they're displaced from a Sgt. Pepper's B-side then I'll eat my shorts. But at the same time, even folks who were listening to Top 40s loved OS and songs like \\"Kids\\" and \\"Time to Pretend\\" and I guess if that's what they associated MGMT with, then I guess this might be slightly disappointing.    My take: It's a different sounds from the first album, and there aren't as many catchy hits, but anyone who loves the psychedelic pop sound of the late '60s and early '70s, will love it.  And that being said, there are plenty of catchy songs on here. It might just take a bit more of an indepth listen. Even the 12 minute Siberian Breaks is quite good, even though it might seem like something that would just drag on and on. I don't really buy into the notion that people have that MGMT was just going anti-mainstream with this, because the album is too good for it to simply be a troll attempt on the music world.

B004DBU0UW|5.0|Patton is one of my favorite films.  The entire cast give excellent performances,  and the score for the film could not get any better.  I believe that this George C. Scott's best film.    When watching the film, don't get too caught up in the fact that, from a historic stand point, it is not accurate.  The tanks and other equipment are more modern versions than what was actually used during World War II (to save costs, the producers employed the use of the Spanish Army for many of the battle scenes).  This is not a documentary, it is a dramatic re-enactment of General George S. Patton's career during the war.  It is a biased movie, showing the trials and tribulations, and ultimate triump of General Patton.  What makes this movie great, is that all of the elements of the movie, the acting, casting, effects, and the music score, combine together seamlessly.  I highly recommend this film.

1439177783|4.0|This book was a fantastic retelling of the horror that can be anorexia.  I could see a lot of my own struggles through the words of Portia.

How unattainable is that for the regular person?
0441018866|5.0|I have read many of Alastair Reyolds' novels.  I actually passed over this one a few times because, after reading the description, the premise of the book did not seem that appealing - a thousand clones and their adventures.  Sounds strange and boring.  But boy, was I ever wrong.  To start with, the clones are not identical, and form a kind of starfaring band that has all the usual dynamics of any large club or organization or group of starfarers traversing 6 million years of time might have.  But the book is not so much about the whole group as it is about two of them.  The scope of this novel is truly amazing.  Dyson spheres, sun spitting wormholes, androids, awesomely powerful starships created by long dead civilizations.  It also has a central mystery that keeps the reader rapturously engaged.  Good story telling.  Good ending.  The is one of my two favorite sci-fi novels of all time.  The other one is Deepness in the Sky.  I also appreciated the fact that Reynolds did not take pot shots at Christianity in this book, the way so many sci-fi authors do these days (inexplicably, as the super majority of Americans self identify as Christians). The characters are also cleaner and don't have the dark goth feel of some of Reynold's earlier work; I always felt that was unnecessary.  On the whole, one of the best space operas I have ever read, and I have read many.

0553382152|1.0|I was given this book as a Christmas present by my daughter.  I am halfway through with it and I doubt I wish to finish it.  It is a piece of unmitigated trash, totally out of sync with the reality of Who Jesus Christ said He is.<br /><br />1.  He is not \\"a God.\\" (Pg. 54)  He is THE God, one in substance with the Father.  Jesus said \\"If you have seen me, you have seen the Father.\\"  As reported by other reviewers here, Eadie's definition of God is the Mormon definition, which is a soul damning heresy that the Church fought for years.<br /><br />2.  We did not pre-eternally exist. (Pg. 57 and others) Where she gets this idea can only be from Mormon teaching.  It is not inscripture and it makes us more than just created beings.  Another heresy.<br /><br />3.  She teaches that all religions are equally good and have something positive to teach those who adhere to them. (Pg.56)  Hogwash!!!!  So the Aztec priest, cutting the still beating hearts out of 50,000 innocents a year to placate their blood thirsty demon god has something possitive to teach us?  Well, I guess so.  I am positive that I am overjoyed not to have been born an Aztec in that century!!!  What a load of garbage!!!<br /><br />The book is, like those teachings of all false cultists, filled lies wrapped in some truth to make it palatable to the ignorant and undiscerning.  We should pray for Betty Eadie.  She has had an experience with a demon (in the Bible described as an \\"angel of light\\") and is decieved.<br /><br />The Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us.  In Him is the manifestation of God's Truth, and His teachings were given to the Apostles.  For 1500 years, the Church He left on this earth guided mankind into a relationship with God through the forgiveness of their sins and entry into the Kingdom of God through baptism.  It was only after a rebellious monk opened the Pandora's Box of dissenting thought that the multitude of false religions and false cults has exploded over the last 500 years.<br /><br />There is no Truth to this book.  Pray for Betty Eadie and avoid this thing like the plague it is!Betty Eadie and avoid this thing like the plague it is!

030746363X|2.0|I enjoy bodybuilding, and I read the sections regarding bodybuilding with the most interest - it gave me a mixed opinion of this book.      The author summarizes many of the ideas that are out there in the bodybuilding world.  He gives the impression of picking up on ideas at random, somewhat, and while many of the ideas are good advice, there are no new ideas here, and he latches on to some of the more sensationalistic & silly concepts out there.  For instance, the ridiculous introduction which talks about timed intake of garlic oils to lose weight while eating more.  His diet plan is based around the idea of avoiding high GI carbs such as sugar, white rice, etc.  However, GI is irrelevant unless eating the food on its own - eating a potato with a steak will slow down the digestion of the potato.  So GI numbers may be a reason to avoid snacking on candy or fruit juices, but how many people have a potato or a bowl of rice by itself?  Bathing in cold water to lose weight has a certain logic but is generally discredited - David Palumbo, whom the author cites as a guru, calls the idea \\"hocus pocus.\\"    I didn't care for the organization of this book.  It jumps from topic to topic somewhat haphazardly - from losing weight to gaining weight to hitting a baseball to having great sex.  It reads like somebody's internet blog.  There's contradictions in advice and sometimes even \\"facts\\" between these mini-chapters.  I think a more informed and nuanced opinion of the issues can be derived from spending four hours reading up the ideas on one's own.    That said, while I still didn't like the book, most popular diet & exercise books are complete nonsense, and this one had some good ideas.

B004DMAZQK|4.0|British trio White Lies are back with their sophomore album \\"Ritual\\". This time they employ the production services of Alan Moulder (Depeche Mode, Erasure, Elastica, Gary Numan, The Killers, Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins, Death Cab For Cutie, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Interpol) to name but a few. The funny thing is, \\"Ritual\\" is a very close cousin to their first album, 2009's \\"To Lose My Life\\".<br /><br />This is the band exploring some new textures while operating within the confines of the sound of their debut. It's slightly darker, more melancholic than their debut, but equal in strength of melodies and hooks. I like the video for first single \\"Bigger Than Us\\" with its E.T.: The Extraterrestrial references, and the song is pretty good too. It's a good choice for first single. The other potential singles here are \\"Peace & Quiet\\", \\"Streetlights\\", \\"Holy Ghost\\" and \\"The Power & The Glory\\" with \\"Come Down\\" rounding out my list of top tracks.<br /><br />Album opener, \\"Is Love\\" followed by \\"Strangers\\" are fine, but they somehow lack the punch of the above mentioned songs. By far, my least favorite tracks are \\"Bad Love\\" and \\"Turn The Bells\\". They just kind of sit there, taking up space. Still, that's six really good tracks, plus two decent ones, so that's eight fine tracks, and the two weak tracks do not pull the album down much. Four stars, just like their debut.<br /><br />Now, let's get to some interesting bits here. The band keeps insisting that they are really influenced by Talking Heads, and not by who they directly sound like: Joy Division and Julian Cope. They say they are not really familiar with Joy Division or Julian Cope, yet I can not help but think of Joy Division when I listen to White Lies. Of course White Lies are direct descendants of the post-punk, new wave, new romanticist movement of the late 1970's and early 1980's (one of my favorite eras of music). I might also add that I hear touches of Rush, Human League, Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark, Duran Duran, Thompson Twins, The Cure, The Psychedelic Furs, The Church, Inxs and Big Country thrown about for good measure, and mind you, I like them all.<br /><br />What will be interesting to see is whether the band breaks out of their comfort zone like all the bands mentioned above, and whether they push themselves artistically to expand and experiment with their sound. Otherwise, they might as well quit while they're ahead here.<br /><br />So, \\"Ritual\\" is four stars, not five, good, but not great (not classic). If you like new wave, post-punk, nu wave, neo-punk this is highly recommended.he Cure, The Psychedelic Furs, The Church, Inxs and Big Country thrown about for good measure, and mind you, I like them all.

0374290024|3.0|Given the back cover blurbs by Jared Diamond and David S. Landes, whose works I've read and whom Norris mentions in his text, I expected better -- the book is instead somewhat of a watered-down combination of both. I got the feeling that I've read this elsewhere, but by authors who make their arguments in a more concise and less tautological manner. In his effort to appeal to a popular audience, Norris references the writings of Arthur C. Clarke, Charles Dickens, etc., throughout. Are the analogies with Jean Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear and von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods really necessary? Get an editor who will cut this distracting junk out. People who are interested in learning more about what Norris summarizes will find it difficult to locate his sources; although there is a bibliography at the end, there is a lack of citations in the text. The last chapter -- the \\"for now\\" part -- is random speculation.

B003ZWTGKU|2.0|Never mind the editing or the \\"new\\" production (which was previously the \\"old\\" production at Covent Garden).  What almost totally ruined this performance for me are the insanely distended tempi of Michel Plasson.  Kaufmann is even taxed at times by the absurdly drawn out phrasing.  This is one of my favourite operas, so I was sufficiently miffed at Plasson that I grabbed seven different recordings of the opera from my collection with a variety of conductors with different backgrounds and timed them all and arrived at an average of 2 hours 6 minutes in total, with little fluctuation in individual acts.  Plasson adds nearly half an hour to that time!  Most conductors do Act One in about 40 minutes while Plasson drags it out to 48; almost everyone does Act II in 29 or 30 minutes while Plasson takes 38.  There is artistic license, and then there is just total disregard for the score (not to mention the singers).  I really have trouble listening to this DVD, despite Kaufmann's deeply moving, superbly sung performance (OK, his French is not the greatest).  I recently heard Kaufmann sing the role in Vienna under Frédéric Chaslin (who brought the opera in at exactly the average: 2 hours 6 minutes) and what a HUGE difference it made!  Kaufmann sounded far more secure and relaxed, and even his diction improved (the guy sitting next to me was from Paris and had attended several of the Bastille performances and vouched for the improvement).  Also the excesses of the Andrei Serban production (the one which looks like the characters are all out of \\"Mad Men\\") have been toned down and some costumes changed, and it's now far better than what you see on the DVD made with the premiere cast in 2005 in almost every aspect.  I hate when record companies rush to get the latest superstar on DVD the moment he or she takes on a new role.  It's so unfair to the artist(s): they need time to grow into roles, and the opportunity to try other productions and interact with other conductors and cast members.  There's also the human aspect: imagine the immense pressure of singing a demanding role for the first time knowing that it's not only being broadcast on radio and TV, it's what is being documented on DVD for posterity.  Not exactly an atmosphere where one can just relax and immerse oneself in the role.  Sophie Koch was also the Charlotte in Vienna, and while she sang well, the voice lacks the warmth and femininity that I want in the role.  This is always a problem for me: my best experiences with the role were with singers who, to put it kindly, were physically no longer suited for the part, but sang it magnificently: Christa Ludwig (who was 43) and Régine Crespin (who was over 50 when I heard her do it).  In the Paris DVD, I also hate the buffo antics of the singers playing the Bailiff and his buddies Johann and Schmidt: they really overdo it.  The parts can be well-sung and still have the intended comic relief.  They are annoying as hell.  Tézier is luxury casting as Albert, but I found Gillet insecure and charmless as Sophie.  I hope Kaufmann will have the opportunity for another widely-available broadcast (audio and/or visual) as Werther.  It will be lovely to see how grows into the role.  Let's just hope that the seduction by Wagner does no harm: he sang only four of his scheduled six Bayreuth Lohengrins in 2010 and will not return for the revival in 2011; he's currently warming up for the Met's new \\"Walküre.\\"  Word is his recent \\"Fidelio\\" Florestans (Munich?) were less than successful.  Since it seems that Villazón is now pretty much out of the picture, our great hopes for the middleweight Italian and French repertoire are Kaufmann and Piotr Beczala.
B00005B36H|5.0|I didn't really know to many Tool song before this album.  I was 12 when it came out.  I new the song Sober and that was about it.  I had hear a few other songs on the radio but didn't know they were Tool.  I decided to by the album after hearing Schism on the radio.  Also hearing parts of songs on the commercials.  Well now I'm a huge Tool fan and now have all their cds.  Lateralus is not only my favorite Tool cd, but it is my favortie cd of all time.  I can listen to it all the time.  Even though it about 9-10 years old it is my most played cd.  I thing every song is good.  Songs like The Grudge, Schism, and Lateralus are great.  I can't explain how good this cd is.  I have read a lot of the reviews and can't belive the people who complain about it.  Yes the songs are long, but I like long songs.  I hate when a song is to short and you want more.  With Lateralus you get more of a song and you still want more.
141694737X|5.0|I have three daughters 18 month ,3  and 5 years old.  My 18 month old can't get enough of this cute book.  She is so excited every time she open one of the flaps. This book is simple enough for my 5 yr old to read it and my 3year old makes great sound effects for each flap. I recommend for 3 month the about age 6.
B000EULJLU|4.0|This album is not one of Tool's best.  I would have given it 3 stars if it weren't for a few songs and the album art.  The art alone I think is worth the buy.  It has great and interesting 3D images.  The song vicarious is good.  To my the song Right in Two is by far the best on the cd.  The rest of the songs are good or ok, but nothing special.
0439023521|5.0|This was a book I literally could not put down.  I am a fan of young adult fiction but this tops everything I've read.  If I were a teacher I would assign this book because the discussions it could raise are nearly infinite... family, society, war, reality television, love, sacrifice, the list goes on and on.
1588167461|5.0|I'm not a big fan of the magazine  (I prefer GQ) but with the sharpness and flair of this book it actually surprises me that it came from   Esquire.     This is the perfect guide book for anybody in the professional world or just a mature person that decided to stop dressing like a teen or like the cast of the Jersey Shore. You do not have to be a beginner to be able to appreciate the style tips, list of recommended companies, and ancient rules that you can choose to follow or like many of the greats - break.     One of my favorite dimensions of the book is the list of products and directions on how to use them to better care for your wardrobe. There is an endless list of ways on expanding the life of the most important parts of your wardrobe. It may seem tedious but it really does work and saves you tons of money in the long run.     Overall this is a very organized guide which makes it very useful to reference whenever you need to look back on certain tips.
B001EO2UJK|3.0|THIS BOX IS REALLY JUST FOR THE SURROUND MIXES. Sad to say, but the New STEREO MIXES are uniformly distorted and pathetic to be called 'Upgraded Sound'. Comparing EVERY track on THE LAMB or TRICK OF THE TAIL clearly demonstrates the new mixes as HORRIBLE. Steve Hackett was mixed FURTHER down in certain songs. The mixes are not 'magic' as were the originals. The mid90s 'DEFINITIVE EDITION' CDs are STILL THE BEST SOUND AVAILABLE ON THE CLASSIC GENESIS CATALOG. (simply raise the volume if you want it at PREPOSTEROUS levels...but they will not distort as all the new crappy mixes do.) This is a sad sad situation, as the music deserves to not be ANNOYING to the Ears..as ALL THE NEW STEREO MIXES ARE!! Any Genesis fan MUST have this box just for the Surround mixes, as they were among the greatest recordings from the 1975-1981 era. But, the engineers who made Genesis sound like crap with the new EXPLOSIVE DISTORTED NO-DYNAMIC MIXES should be flogged.
1438509480|5.0|Marcus Aurelius' Meditations is an excellent philosophical text that teaches others how to treat others, live happier, resist evil, and teaches us that anger is bad.  I was introduced to Marcus Aurelius in a Philosophy course and that is why I had to get the full text of Meditations.  The version I have is from BOOK Jungle (copyright February 2, 2009) and is an easy to read text.  I highly recommend Meditations to others, since there are gems in Marcus Aurelius' book and Meditations is one that will have you ponder the meaning of what Marcus Aurelius' is trying to say.
B001UGIRF8|3.0|Considering how uniformly awful sound of  'New' Stereo mixes are on all the Genesis reissues, it's maddening to consider they used the same mixes to press onto vinyl. CDs in the DVD/CD sets are almost unlistenable being mastered too loudly. original mixes were good enough for Genesis' existence, Why are they not good enough now?  George Lucas Disease I suppose. It's nice to have the perspective of a new mix, yet, in light of HOW BAD the CD sound quality is in all the Genesis remixed collection,  unless the vinyl sounds COMPLETELY different, and an engineer attests to the fact that these lps aren't overprocessed, this will sit on the shelf of your local record shop. to be burned twice with unlistenable music is 'shame on me'. Get nice condition imported vinyl of the original issues. Would Cost less too! This box is a great idea, but it's misguided to put distorted mixes onto vinyl. Defeats the purpose.
B00140PK6O|5.0|This movie was so very excellent!  I hated when it ended, but luckily I saw the continuation dvd and enjoyed more watching.

0316044695|5.0|This is one of the best nonfiction books I have ever read.  I am very interested in military operations and history, and this account of Navy SEAL training and of Operation Red Wings is positively riveting.  Marcus Luttrell tells the amazing story of his upbringing, SEAL training, and mission in Afghanistan.  Surrounded by countless Taliban warriors, Luttrell and his small team lay waste to hordes of the enemy with extreme prejudice.  Luttrell's survival story following the battle and his interaction with the Pashtun mountain people is very interesting as well.  You will feel the intensity of the battle as you read--you can almost feel the bullets whiz by.  This is a book that will give you a real appreciation for the training and hardship that our special operations warriors go through.  I cannot say enough good things about this book--I stayed up half the night on a work night to finish it, it was so gripping.  The icing on the cake is Mr. Luttrell's consistent reminder that one of the deadliest forces against our warrior heroes is the out-of-control American liberal media and their elitist cohorts, who indeed spend a great part of their time waging a battle at home against our military forces, fighting for American rights for the terrorists that we are compelled to battle as well as trying to forward ridiculous rules of engagement (ROE) that lead to tragedies like this mission and the loss of more American lives.  Through this incredible tale, a great contrast emerges between the valor, lifelong hard work, and sacrificial death of these and other American heroes and the soft, self-centered and aloof lives of ivy-league educated liberals who in their utter ungratefulness and love for the enemy and anyone but Americans (and especially not for our military) have made themselves hostile to their own country.  The reader should remember that without men like Luttrell and his team, we would all now be slaves of a tyrannical government.  To Marcus, Mikey, Danny, and Axe, SEAL Team 10 and the 160th Night Stalkers!  Superb!
B002ZG993Q|5.0|OK, I loved this movie. I also get where everyone who says it is slow paced is coming from.  If you watch this, go into it with the knowledge that this is nothing like any of the Bourne movies.  The scenery is stunning as is the camera work, George Clooney is excellent in this roll, the guns are good, and the women are hot.  I enjoyed it tremendously.  Like I said though... if you're looking for a go go go movie with 45 minutes of stunning fight scenes and 1200 rounds of ammo down range, this one may not be for you.
B002Q8Z8KG|5.0|This is a smart show that is not preachy and is neither too PC nor too uptight.  Well written, witty and fast paced, the show can be both hilarious and heart-warming.  Although it does not shy away from \\"modern issues\\", the show is one I watch with my family.  One of the best to come out in a long time.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Spectacular achievement of technology and imagination. Not just the animation, but the subtlety, skill and humor with which it is used; true art. Hard to find words. Just possibly up there with Shakespeare and Einstein's Theory of Relativity as intellectual achievements.<br /><br />Also a triumph of industrial management. Can you imagine what must be involved in organizing hundreds of people to smoothly produce such a complex product?<br /><br />And to think that back in the 60's, people wondered what the computer would ever be good for!
B003Y01JRG|5.0|Love this album! The best Leonard Cohen live performances I've heard. Instrumental sound quality from the musicians that back him up are matchless ..this is a must have.  The vinyl edition is superb - the choice and sequence of songs are well placed. (I should frame the album cover)
1400064287|5.0|I rarely read books that get classified in the \\"Business\\" or \\"Management\\" sections of bookstores.  There are many reasons for this; don't get me started.  The primary reason I ended up with this one was because I was looking for some interesting material for the driving that I do regularly, and this one presented itself in CD form.  I don't know whether or not I ever would have pulled it off the shelf in bound form, but that would be too bad because it is well worth a listen, or a read.  The co-author brothers (Chip is a professor at Stanford's business school, Dan is an educational consultant and entrepreneur) set out to identify what makes one message effective while others are not.  What makes a message stick in people's heads?  It sounds simple enough, but as any teacher, parent, presenter, or manager knows, it's not all that easy.  As the authors explain, it's not simply a matter of finding a catchy phrase (though that can help).  And it's certainly not a matter of putting all the statistics and other facts into your presentation that you can cram into the allowable time.  There's a huge difference between information display and information transfer (as Edward Tufte has famously argued with regard to PowerPoint).  The Heaths identify six elements of a \\"sticky\\" message: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, and Stories.  OK, the acronym SUCCESs is kind of corny--which they admit--but look, it stuck.  I didn't have to go back to the source to remember it.  But that's not the point.  The point is that what they say makes very good sense, and they demonstrate it with numerous persuasive case studies.  Their style is engaging, intelligent, and practical.  That last part is crucial.  Anyone who reads this book will be in a position to examine their effectiveness as a communicator and to make improvements if needed.  It's a shame that the only place I've seen this book shelved in bookstores is in the Business/Management section.  It's really about communication--useful for business, yes, but in what area of life that involves more than one person are communication skills NOT important?  I'm still not likely to spend a lot of time in the Business section of my local bookstore, but I'm glad I spent enough time in the books-on-CD section to find this one.
030746363X|2.0|I purchased this book after listening to Tim Ferris on the Paleo Solution Podcast.  After reading Tim Ferris's book his diet prescriptions for slo-carb are contradicted by his other recomendations later in the book.  Ferris states that the book can be read modularly - this would work if you only focused on one area and did not read and follow the recommendations in the other parts of the book.  Most of the recommendations listed in the book can be found for free on the websites of the experts that Ferris recommends.  I would not recommend buying the book, but borrowing it to pick up new ideas and then go to the experts website. These approaches may have worked with Tim Ferris, but will probably not work for everybody.  The amount of profanity and name dropping is excessive and not appropriate.  I gave the book two stars for the ego-centric attitude of the author displayed throughout the book and the questionable marketing tactics.  I have also stopped my subscription to Paleo Solutions podcast because they did not critically question Ferris, misleading the listeners to the belief that they were in agreement with Ferris's viewpoint. The appearance of Ferris on their podcast seemed more of an attempt to use his name recognition to increase their listeners above six.  Now they will only have five.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This is a terrific movie - definitely a cut above all the stuff with big special effects and small storytelling coming from Hollywood these days.  And beyond that, it doesn't shy away from some of the biggest controversies of human time.
0385341679|2.0|As a fantasy and romance books fan I was so dissapointed with not only this book, but also the high average rating. If, like me, you are over a certain age (I am 35) it is so boring to read, and if you are younger, it provides such a bad example of a heroine. Mac is self-center, pretty stupid and easily tells untruths. Don't get me started on the sex and female/male relationships. This is a bad book with well written parts. I was outraged on behalf of any twenty something girl.
0060989157|5.0|This book is great. Easy to read, hard to put down. When I was done reading it I wanted to read it again.
0545123275|4.0|Maggie Stiefvater is a great writer, with flowing descriptive passages, and I really liked her innovative use of the dual perspective in this story. It is rare that we get a look into the guy's head in YA (or adult) fiction. I suppose this is because the target audience for these books is overwhelmingly female. Anyway, usually we are trapped inside the mind of an insecure female adolescent constantly wondering what the too good to be true mega-rich super hot supernatural love interest could ever possibly see in her. I liked that in this book it was the male who was riddled with doubt and the young girl who was strong and capable. The years of impossible silent longing before the two met in person gave a more plausible explanation than is often seen in YA fiction for the very quick and all-encompassing love that developed between the two main characters, and the fact that the two have been ****POSSIBLE SPOILER DON'T READ THIS PART IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW***** infected with the \\"wolf\\" element also helps explain their single-minded devotion (wolves mate for life).     Despite my general appreciation of the book, I did feel it had some flaws. It seemed rather unbelievable that the pack wouldn't have devoted some serious resources to investigating the cause of their shifting apart from one move to a warmer climate undermined by a gust of air conditioning (seriously, when Sam could stand the freezing temperatures between the house and the car???). This lack of curiosity seemed particularly unbelievable in light of the suspected relationship between shifting (or not shifting) and early death. I also had problems with *****POSSIBLE SPOILER DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW***** the \\"cure\\". I just couldn't believe two intelligent people would jump so heedlessly into something they had not researched when loved ones' lives were on the line and that, on top of that, they would not choose a more benign option (I am sure there are several other ways to achieve their goal,with better survival rates).     All in all, the book was well-written and had nicely drawn characters and a love that felt real between the two protagonists, but could have done with a bit more planning to increase plausibility.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|I had to have this because it was such a cool movie when I was growing up.  Now on blu-ray?  I'd love a copy, thank you.  I say, jump on it while it's still here, things like this tend to go out of print if one waits too long.

B000EF5NAS|2.0|After reading all the great reviews about this movie I was disappointed to see what I saw. Don't take me wrong. I love chick flicks, but this one in particular just does not seem to be right.   Although the problems (like the racism and the domestic abuse) touched upon in this movie are real, their depiction in the movie is weak and forced and somehow lifeless. I understood that the creators of this movie wanted to say but they did not persuade me.   Maybe this movie just did not age gracefully.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I saw this at the actual movies. Because I had to check it out on the big screen.<br />A nice group of old school action heroes and some from the near past.<br />I'll leave the extensive plots, depth of characters, and all associated to this genderless, iphone addicted, hyper intelligent group of people who are the mainstream in America now.<br /><br />Admittedly there could have been more action for some characters.<br />And Jet Li really did not deliver in this particular film as he has done in others.<br />Statham shined as usual and Rourke was pretty good, albeit I would have preferred him a bit more maniacal.<br /><br />A lot of movies are fun to watch, but I would love to live this movie.<br />Guns, fighting, exotic locales, and mayhem.<br />Good old fashion testosterone laden adventure.<br /><br />I am going to own enough copies of this so I can keep watching it until I get old and senile.

015206396X|3.0|A Graceling is a person born with a a magnified skill.  Gracelings, who have two different colored eyes, are considered property of the King.  Katsa, a Graceling, is used by her uncle, the King, as a killing machine.  She doesn't like killing or violence and only uses her Grace if there is no other option.  During a rescue mission, she meets and fights Po-the only person who ever put up a challenge for her.  After knocking him out, Katsa resumes her mission, only to meet Po again when she returns.  Both set out to solve the mystery surrounding the kidnapping and rescue.<br /> I liked this book.  I loved the world and the whole concept of Graces.  I really wanted to love the book, but there were a few things that I just didn't like.  They mostly revolved around the ending.  I just didn't like it.  What I did like was the suspense and how Katsa was strong and independent.  I liked Katsa and Po's relationship and how their personalities complemented each other.  Leck creeped me out-as he should.  Bitterblue reminded me of my niece.  I liked how Katsa felt almost maternal towards Bitterblue.  Overall, it was a good read.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Gave this DVD to my daughter for Christmas with great anticipation.  Jaden Smith is an excellent actor and the movie contains a powerful message on the topic of bullying. While the story itself was entertaining, the fact that the DVD messed up at the end was not.  The replacement DVD still had a few kinks (pixelated scenes), but I was pleased at how quickly I received it.  I am keeping the replacement DVD and will continue to shop Amazon.  I have ordered dozens (maybe hundreds) of items and this is the first glitch!

0307588343|5.0|(Please note the constant sarcasm)    I shall tell you my complaints now.     How dare you inform me, a common simpleton, of the collapse of a giant bank that perhaps helped send our county into an economic tale-spin?    I prefer to wade in confusing of the current state of things.     Really knowing the current situation and its causations are worthless. There are people who are paid to analyze and act in my best decision. I mean, obviously Fuld and a good portion of the financial industry was there watching out for me. They all were filled with the American dream: Self interest and self advancement. Bigger the better I always say.     And also! Mr. McDonald, how dare you let this book become entertaining and interesting. Who do you think you are marketing to? The people who are uneducated on the financial situation and are seeking to know a little more? Obviously that was not me. Here I am, just a simple economics major who does not want to learn about the crisis by reading lots of different books on the situation. Do you really think I want to supplement my education to strive for advancement in the future working world? How dare you educate me on the absurdities that were happening at Lehman Brothers? I swear.    Perhaps here's another thing, this information on your life! Why would I want to know about your past? Do you seriously thing I would want you to prove your veracity and provide a genuine description of your past? I just want to read a book from a Harvard grad who got a wonderful job handed to him right out of college! He obviously would have more life experiences to supplement the book and connect with a common man audience. Seriously. Give me the man with at least a $200,000 degree.     You want more? This reliance on analysts! Research? When was that ever helpful? Instinct and reliance that if you simply keep buying things would turn out better. Research is not necessary for that. You would've learned that if you were handed more things in life. Hah, research. I laugh.     Simply hated it. I couldn't put it down that's how much I hated it. I went and talked to all my friends about how much I hated it. So much hate for this book. Had no relevance to the modern world, was not even a bit informing. Hated the way he wrote. Who writes in an intelligent and interesting tone anymore? It just is disgusting.     I'm with all the big wigs on Wall-Street. Let's run for the hills acquiring companies on the brink of failure. Leverage the company more and more, throw my money in your bank account. I feel you know better what to do with it.     Don't read or buy this book. Bad idea.     (I hope you enjoyed the obvious sarcasm. Now in all seriousness, I recommend this book to all. If you're a simple citizen, read and learn from this book, and then recommend it to all your friends. If you're a humble bank exec, read and learn from the past mistakes, pretty please? Thank you and good day. Go out and buy!)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I decided to take the 30 Day Shred seriously and really do it every day.  As someone with a very busy lifestyle, the fact that it is only 20 minutes sold me on it in the first place (and you just need some hand weights, no bands or yoga balls).  I'm a decently athletic person, but when I first started I was about 20 pounds overweight and had not been exercising regularly.  Whoa.  I couldn't believe how hard level 1 was.  I was extremely sore for about the first 4 days, but I pushed through it and improved quickly and dramatically.  Now, I'm about a week away from finishing my 30 days and I can tell that this DVD has made a huge difference in my body, both in how I look and feel.  I haven't weighed myself but can tell I've \\"shredded\\" some fat and my whole body looks more toned-- legs, butt, abs, and arms.  I wouldn't even really say I've changed my eating habits.      My favorite thing about this DVD (besides the short time length) is that there are the 3 different levels.  I worked my way up as Jillian suggests, but now that I can do them all (I could NOT have done level 2 or 3 at the beginning) I can change it up based on how I'm feeling that day.  If I'm hungover or didn't get a lot of sleep, I do level 1.  Otherwise I do 2 or 3.  I'm a big fan of having options like that.  Jillian is straight-forward and encouraging, and one of her backup girls does modified moves when possible, which is good motivation to keep trying when it gets too strenuous.  The only thing that sucks is that at this point I loathe the background music and it gets stuck in my head, tormenting me constantly.  But that's not a deal-breaker.  Also, there's a lot of jumping, so if you have knee issues or tend to get shin splints, be warned.  Now that I'm in shape (YAY!), my plan from here on out is to buy some more workout DVDs and keep this one in the rotation, making sure I work out at least 4x/week.  I think this is a great way to jump-start your transition into a more active lifestyle.  Strongly recommend.
0061900656|5.0|Our 2 1/2 year old has really taken to this book--it's perfectly age appropriate.  It is NOT wordy, like one negative review said.  2-3 simple, short sentences per two page spreads is not wordy for a two year old.  The pictures are simple and it addresses how a baby cannot do the same things as a big boy--walk, talk, eat pizza, etc.  It has a very positive tone and talks about all the nice things a big brother can do for a new (genderless, so it works for everyone) baby; i.e. sing a song, hold gently after asking Mommy, helping Daddy with diaper, keeping the baby warm and cozy.    One negative review complained that the mother doesn't hold the baby at all--that's just not true.  It shows her holding the baby on two separate pages to be exact...same as Dad and the Big Brother.  It does show the baby in a stroller, so if you think strollers are terrible, I guess you'll dislike that.      I do agree with the complaints that it doesn't address nursing at all.  Not many books do--I wish it had one page showing Mom nursing the baby with a simple \\"Sometimes babies drink milk from Mommy too.\\" along with the bottle.  But it only shows a bottle in passing in any case.    If you have an 18 month-3 year old about to be a big brother, this book is a perfect introduction for them.  Well worth it!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|WOW, That was the first word out of my mouth when I held this knife. Everything about this knife is perfect the weight,the size,the thickness (it's thickier then a pry bar)and it's durability. Your just not going to break this knife. I love it!
0375701427|1.0|Many things irritated me about this book, chief among them is that the narrator (Roth himself writing as Nathan Zuckerman) seems to think his and his friends' and Newark, New Jersey's very existences themselves merit an exhausting, nostalgic portrayal without coherent character development or plot.<br /><br />Pages upon pages are lent to describe ancillary subjects such as glove manufacturing and beauty pageants, and to recount conversations about the protagonist's daughter's trips into New York (conversation #10 about New York, conversation #47 about New York, etc.). Swede Levov's attempts to justify himself to his brother, to his daughter's speech therapist, and to his daughter's Marxist confidante are painful in their futility and repetitiveness. On this front Roth was on to something, but he does nothing more than to pound the reader over the head with Levov's existential crisis, so what's the point?<br /><br />The meandering, neurotic, conflicted retrospectives about understanding other people and understanding WHY and HOW we understand other people produces an insular narrative that is more repulsive than inviting. I'm sure this book captures the so-called zeitgeist for Newark Jews born in the inter-war period, but for this Texas boy born in the `80s, I could not care less.
B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|Forget the hoo-ha over the technology of the sound tracks, what makes this is the beautiful sensitive Japanese sound track amd what ruins it is the absolutely ghastly cheesy American dub. Even Americans are likely to find it hard to digest and for English, Australian and other \\"English\\" speakers - have a pack of Immodium handy!<br /><br />The film itself is a beautiful Japanese take on the Little Mermaid, and how delightfully it is done. The Japanese can really do these things so differently, (as one should expect of course), and with such style. I urge everyone to look at the extras, especially the Japanese cast recording session and the Miyazaki interview where he makes his points so well.<br /><br />There is only one way to watch this and that is with the Japanese track, (lossless 6.1 in region B countries) with subtitles. The American dub is horrible and that is why I have marked the final score down as kids will need the dub. What a shame. All regions seem to have this dreadful dub on Blu-ray so no point to look for an \\"English\\" or Australian version. Grin and bear it or just enjoy the Nihongo!
B0041KKYEM|4.0|I didn't enjoy watching Black Swan. It would not have taken much persuading me to get up and walk out. As we left the cinema, other than to remark upon its startling intensity, my initial reactions to it were mostly negative. I enjoyed it much more in the twenty four hours afterwards, unpeeling its cuticles and scratching at its feathered back. That suggests the jarring sensation is a superficial one.<br /><br />It was never going to be straightforward with Darren Aronofsky at the helm. Black Swan starts out in a fairly conventional direction - the sheltered heroine battling to escape her castle - but veers off in quite another. So, we watch the unfolding petals of a cosseted young bud, kept out of the light past her date of maturity by well-intending but all the same mendacious forces. We see this charted against the depredations of her environment - there are big, bad wolves everywhere you look - and the technical and spiritual challenges she must overcome to earn her place as the prima ballerina, an award we infer is long past its due date. We see Nina battle her own demons and those of her protectors: there is self-flagellation in her insistence on technical perfection, mirrored in Nina's chastity - self imposed, we suspect - but it is all reinforced by a text-book neurotic, over-protective, historically harmed mother. In a way her mother's behaviour is a sort of vicarious self-flagellation too: Nina is simply the unfortunate vehicle for working out her mother's own self torment.<br /><br />So much, so conventional: as the drama shifts onto Monsieur Leroy, the darkly charged womaniser of a ballet director. He is everything Nina is not: he represents everything she is afraid of: passion: licentiousness.  We first meet him pawing his stable of swans, like a Siamese King inspecting his harem. He's a tease, too: those he has *not* patted can report to his chamber at sundown. There is an uneasy equilibrium, though, in the same way there is between lions and gazelles in the Serengeti: this is an ecosystem, and for it to function it must be so.<br /><br />And then, breaking up the order and hierarchy is a new dancer, flown in to neurotic New York from free-loving West Coast San Francisco to deputise for an injured dancer. In case that wasn't enough of a clue, we're told in an off-stage exchange between Leroy and Nina, she is a free spirit: she may not have all nina's the technical chops, but she *feels it*. She can, Leroy remarks teasingly, let herself go.<br /><br />He tells Nina more than once she is his perfect white swan. But he has trouble seeing the dark alter ego she must inhabit to play the Black Swan.<br /><br />There you have it: a white swan, a black one (though of course it doesn't play out as straightforwardly as that), a wicked witch, Bluebeard. Enough dramatic impetus to last you a week. And boy does Aronofsky deliver it, too: you get that impetus focussed and concentrated into a two hour spell, which is about as intense an experience as you could ask for. This is Scotty in the engine room material: any more, captain, and she'll blow.<br /><br />Aronofsky adds another level of doubt by interposing a layer of fantasy here too. From the opening scene - a dream - we know Nina has an active subconscious, and we're not clear in early exchanges what is \\"real\\" and what is not. This extrapolates unhappily, however: as the flood waters of Nina's neuroticism rise, a fertile imagination gives way to active hallucination, which eventually canters onwards into a diagnosable psychotic episode. Intensity to the max, but it undermines the dramatic development. Was that her mother sleeping in a chair in her room while she fantasised? Was she just fantasising? Or was she fantasising about fantasising?<br /><br />Now once or twice that sort of ambiguity would be ok: adding a little uncertainty to further pique the raging intensity (not, though, like the picture needed it). But Aronofsky over-uses the trick: the default assumption becomes is hallucination. This alleviates, rather than builds, tension.<br /><br />There is a profound undercurrent of ickiness: the self flagellation, per his previous picture, [[ASIN:0847832430 The Wrestler]], becomes self-harming. But it feels unnecessary: guignol for the sake of it. The purely ballet-oriented gruelitudes (particularly the punishment a ballerina administers to her feet) are enough make this point without the (usually illusory) woundings. In sensationalising this way Aronofsky cheapens his art: he cuts it with hyperbole. Likewise with some of the eroticisms: no red-blooded fellow will completely object to being asked to watch Natalie Portman's onanstic activities (and more!), but Aronofsky goes beyond what is strictly necessary for his statement, even if he doesn't ever quite let Nina get to hers (all the more tension!): It is a little artistically voyeuristic.<br /><br />Because of all his mucking about in mental hyperspace, where we don't know what's real and what's not, Aronofsky's climax misses its beat profoundly. It's a silly, trite, implausible ending - the credits fade up and it feels like a ten-ton weight has been dropped on the picture, Monty Python style.<br /><br />Is it a good film? Yes. It's a very good film, though I think I'd take a certain amount of evasive action to avoid watching it again. Is it great one? That I'm not so sure about.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonbuilds, tension.

B001EN71DQ|1.0|These movies are horrific. Terrible writing. Terrible acting. Too sterile. Too much over reliance on special effects. GL needed some people like Howard Kurtz or Irvin Kershner to give real feedback instead of the yes men.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|This is a great action film. Exciting and fun to watch.<br />Matt Damon seems much more into this character than in the Bourne series.<br /><br />The needless R rating probably narrowed the market for this film.<br />The producers should have put more effort into removing the R rating.<br /><br />I give 4 stars simply to agree with many reviewers distracted by the jittery handheld camera shakes...I have never appreciated the impact of this camera technique popularized by NYPD Blue.<br />Hope to see less of this kind of cinematography.<br /><br />But it is interesting to see mainstream hollywood take on some controversial themes....this movie is part of a whole genre of thought provoking films with the consistent involvement of greatly popular character actors like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Greg Kinnear, Matt Damon, Leonardo Di Caprio.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Yes I'm a 23 year old guy. And i'm not afraid anymore to admit that this is my favorite Disney movie of all time. Maleficient is my favourite villain. She's actually one of my rolemodels, yeah I said it, she is, so what? Anyways, you have to have this in your collection. It's a good addition to anyone's dvd bundle.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|This movie tells a true story of a historical breakthrough.  A horse and his owner, anointed not only to breakthrough for women in society but also for God to show His glory in His creation.  Deep story, just enough drama, spiritual enrichment.  A story worth being told.
0307408833|1.0|I just spent 100 dollars at a health food store to prepare my mom some carrot cupcakes + vanilla frosting for her special birthday dinner.  I read all over the book to try to understand if I just added the coconut oil the way it was or melt it.  It didn't say so i just added it to the frosting as is.  The frosting is terrible and I have no icing for the cupcakes.  I am just so disappointed after spending so much money for the coconut oil that I wasted it all.  Bummer.  I really wanted to make a special birthday treat for my mom and am really disappointed with the lack of direction.
0525951652|3.0|When I first discovered that magical class of book known as the historical epic, I discovered \\"The Pillars of the Earth.\\" It was just a mass market paperback with a slightly holographic cathedral and a one word quote from Cosmo on the cover (the words was epic in case your wondering) but after reading just the first few sentences I knew  it would be one the best books I'd ever read.     Since then I've loved Follett's historical-especially his long ones. So when I heard about a really, really long three part novel covering the 20th century ala Michener I was hugely psyched. Such a huge amount to cover. I particularly looked forward to reading about women getting the vote.     But there was a little bit of false advertising. This book isn't so much the first of 3 chronicling the 20th century as it is the story of five different families going through WW1. English Aristocracy, their Welsh servants, Russian Factory workers, American politicians. And wealthy Germans. Together these five families are tied through forbidden love and shady business, battlefields and spy work, coal mines and progressive politics. But what unites them the most it what is uniting ever person on the planet- a great and terrible war taking lives by the tens of thousands as though the earth itself has demanded a blood sacrifice to be paid by all the nations.     I knew almost nothing about the First World War before I read this book so it was a tremendous education-and a horrifying one. Follett spares no gruesome detail, no blood curdling tale. And while that's no different from his other books-he's never held anything back-the seer scale of the violence in this book and its never ending nature wears upon you, making it much more intense.     This book covers a pretty long stretch of time, and it falls prey to some of the traps that long books often do. Pretty large gaps of time are just skipped over. That happened a lot in \\"Pillars\\" also (and that books spanned at least 40 years) but in that case we always got filled in on what we missed-and here we may miss a major battle or romantic decision. Its annoying. And speaking of romance the competency level of Follett's romances has gone way down. None of the romantic linking in this book feel real and the sex scenes-oh! They are just so bad! Nothing at all like the oh so sweet and beautiful romance of Jack and Aliena from \\"Pillars\\" where you just wanted to read their best scenes over and over again.     In the end what I enjoyed the most about this book was the education I got about WW1. The characters were ok and the plot, with the exception of the forbidden romances (there were multiple occasions, each forbidden for a different reason) and the occasional shady dealing, is all straight up war action. And while Follett is clearly trying to follow these five families through generations-well-lets just say he's no Michener. But then no one Michener ever was.     I'll be reading the other books in the series, but I don't know if this is a book I would go back to read again, as I usually do with Follett's novels.    Three stars.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Unbelievable great 3d effects, I like the effects and clear crisp bluray scenes. I'm glad I purchased this dvd, and will recommend to anyone.

0553573411|3.0|I have to admit that after reading \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\", the first novel in the Farseer trilogy, I was not especially impressed. It wasn't a bad novel per say, it was just that was so much more description than dialog and the story itself moved along rather slowly. And then there was the biggest problem of all. It wasn't a novel in the Liveship trilogy.     Robin Hobb is a very, very good writer, but what makes her so impressive to me is her world building skills. The world that the Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man trilogies are set in is so intricately designed that it might as well be real-nothing is left out. Political systems, old mythology, long dead civilizations, plant life, animals odd and normal, social upheaval for reasons we can all identify with...    With the Liveship trilogy that world was explored more and it was all backed by an epic, complicated and long mysterious plot involving tons of actions, adventure, magic and romance. But the Farseer books move in a much smaller neighborhood. In the beginning \\"Royal Assassin\\" Fitz is still recovering from his attempted murder in the mountain kingdoms-but he's determined to get back home and serve Prince Verity, his uncle and heir to the Farseer throne.     But the attack left his weak and feeble-and for an assassin that's a deadly state to be in. Fitz's return to Buckkeep leaves his wary of almost everyone-but there are two new bright lights in his life. Molly, the chandler's daughter from the town of Buckkeep who Fitzs has loved ever since they met him is now working in Buckkeep itself as a chamber maid. Fitz is determined to win her love-but he has a major obstacle to overcome-now that she's in the castle Molly knows who Fitz is really a royal bastard, and doesn't like the fact she's been lied to for years.     But Fitz is keeping an even larger secret. Though he's warned against it ever since meeting the beast master Burrich, even been beaten to keep him from doing it, Fitz has used his Wit, his beast magic to bond with a wild wolf named Nighteyes. And this secret could get him killed.    Meanwhile the Duchies are in peril. The Red ship raiders continue their attacks on the costal villages and the terrible forging of all who are caught in their path. Nothing can reverse this process-the seaming taking of the souls of people, the severing of all their attachments leaving them only with a lust for violence. All those who are blessed with the mysterious skill-including Verity-work to fight them off but they can only do so much, being as few as they ate. And Verity's own life may be in danger, as well as his new wife's. Oddest of all King Shrewd's fool is following Fitz about and uttering strange riddles of prophecies; tellings of a great and terrible destiny...    The plot of this book moves a great deal faster than \\"Assassins Apprentice\\" but in my opinion there's still not enough dialog. And the scope of the book seems a little too small. 90% of it takes place in the walls of Buckkeep. And though we gear about some of Fitzs adventures outside the castle, they aren't told as they happen. When I read a book it always translates into a little movie in my head. I see the background and hear the characters. And after a while I got really, really bored with all the stone walls and woven tapestries I was seeing in this book.      All in all I liked some of this book and disliked some. It provoked no strong emotions in me whatsoever. I do intend to read the last book in the series eventually but I didn't want to run to read the finally like I usually do in multiple volume stories.     Three stars.
0375703764|3.0|I heard from a friend that this was the creepiest book they ever read. While some passages evoked in me an emotion that could be called creepy, I was too tired to read this book. What I mean by that, is that to read this you have to concentrate, and at my standard reading time (10-11 PM), this book was extremely confusing. I guess the author intended it to be that way.     To the people that have the mental power to stay concentrated for long periods of time, go ahead and buy this book. Some of the parts were extremely good, others less, but concentration issues aside, it was a good read, and I suggest it to everybody who loves being put in the state of \\"unheimlich\\" that I certainly do enjoy.     Oh, and if you're wondering why it's not on kindle, you'll figure it out when you get home with your paperback.
B003YOMNCM|3.0|I've only gotten to listening to the Tchaikovsky concerto. First, I was listening in the headphones. As the soloist played her first notes, I was baffled. It's as if she's been thrown around the soundstage. One note is heard from the left, another from the right. That's as if each string had its own sound pickup, or something. Switched to speakers. Effect persisted. I guess some listeners could even get nauseated by that.    Why do some sound engineers try to trick the listeners? Do they listen to their product themselves? I remember another series of bad recordings of a genius pianist - Sviatoslav Richter. One Beethoven sonata was recorded with mics placed so close to the action, that when I was listening to it in earphones, my eardrums were getting a bad beating from that. So sad.    Said that, the performance is not something I'd prefer over, say, Vladimir Spivakov's, which was brilliant.

I've also been eating better quality food than I have in my life.      My report from my doctor was the best I've had in more than 10 years (cholesterol, weight, blood sugar, etc).    He's pieced together such an amazing amount of information in a form that makes it accessible and 'doable.'      Well done, Tim Ferriss, well done.

Great acting by Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp. Alfred Molina was exceptional. Movie was romantic, dramatic,and some comedy thrown in. HIghly recommend this for anyone.
B003L20ICE|4.0|I rented this movie recently and thought it was pretty good. In the end I was left feeling like love would persevere for the two moms. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore are fantastic as Nic and Jules. They seem a bit mismatched and their differences cause a lot of friction throughout, I wondered at times how they had been together for so long when something like composting could set Nic off. But I guess it was meant to show how committed they were to being together and wanted to be stable for their kids, one borne by each of them via a sperm donor. When the oldest turns 18, the youngest talks her into tracking down the donor, splaying the story line down another arc of him and his baggage. The scene where Nic finds Jules' hair at Paul's place while they are having a family dinner...woooo, Annette Bening turns it on, I felt the temperature drop 15 degrees in there! But it brings up the pivotal \\"you don't know what you got 'til it's gone\\" scene (haha, Joni Mitchell reference).  The story is kind of sloppy at times, but so is life...happy, sad, angry, thrilled, confusing, sexy, hurt, drunk, angsty life.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|Nothing can come close to going to YouTube and watching the 1973 Belmont Stakes and the real Secretariat, who in my opinion is the second greatest racehorse of that century. When I learned his story would be by Disney, my heart sank.  It's still sinking.  I'm sorry, but they guess this horse had a heart that weighed in at 22lbs.  A normal horse's heart is 8.5lbs.  Sham too, had a great heart--his weighed in at 18lbs.  So here is a story of two great hearts pitted against each other.  At the end when the two horses had their final legendary battle at the Belmont, if anything, we should have heard mixed in with the sound of thundering hooves--the rhythmic steady beat of that perfect machine beating in Big Red's chest.  A subtle tribute to his immense heart that made it possible for him to do the impossible.  Instead we had sappy annoying and offensive (to anyone who isn't a Christian) praise Jesus music as he pounded for home.  I'm sorry, it ruined the part of the film I was looking forward to most.  It killed it for me.  Now that I own the DVD I can at least mute the sound and not have to listen.  But I'm sorry, when I'm watching a movie about a great racehorse I had the luck to see run in 1973, the last thing I need is to have JESUS crammed down my throat.  It was out of place, it was jarring, it was offensive, AND it distracted me from his story.  Leave it to Disney to ruin what I have looked forward to seeing for years--HIS story, done right.  I wish it could have been done right. I wish it could have on par with Sea Biscuit.  Now THERE was a great film.  This one, lost it for me because of the stupid gospel music--and also because of the fact we had to watch the family cheering instead of getting to see his run at the Preakness--which was also a stunning race we barely got to see.  Was that real footage of the race on the TV?  If so, then what a great idea--but really I would have preferred to actually have seen the RACE, not the actors watching and clapping at the TV.at the TV.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Maybe up to 70% of this film consists of Bella and her vampire boyfriend, Edward, and occassionally his werewolf adversary, lying around in bed or proximate venues necking with their clothes on, discussing such issues as marriage, why they can or can't, should or shouldn't get it on right now, desperately clinging to the PG rating, whether or not the deathless life of the vampire fiend is preferable to human mortality, pre-teen and teen angst regarding the purpose or purposelessness of existence, etc. The screenplay seems to suggest that he's afraid of sucking the life out of her on the spot (maybe a good thing) which will definitely happen if he, literally, gets too much into her.  This A-story or B-story is suggested to provide a certain cohesive tension until graduation night when this event is supposed to commence, but does not.  The school (junior high?) it seems is divided between cliques of vampires and werewolves, excepting the class valedictorian and the faculty, losers who retain their humanity, even in Hollywood. One sits around the school cafeteria with one's respective intimates, vamp or wolf, rapping, and staring down at the crummy institutional fare on the plate, inwardly craving a gut full of good ol' flesh and blood.  Not an unrealistic portrait of school life when honestly considered.  Shakespeare would seriously envy the amount of dialogue packed into this script which deluges the audience in backstory, mercilessly playing on the deepest hopes, fears, and dilemmas of folks between the ages of eight to maybe fifteen, until they either swim or drown. But none can doubt the commercial success of Twilight. The makers have targeted their audience (the bulk of the current theatre-going audience alluded to above) with enviable expertise. Surprisingly, action scenes account for no more than 15% of the footage, rather incredible as they are at that.  The credit here must go to the actors. Ms Stewart is blessed with an expressive, almost Keatonesque melancholy in her eyes and brow which will only mellow with age, an A-list fundament, and she plays admirably to the camera.  As everyone in the world who watches movies knows at this point, Pattinson and K-Stew are beautiful people - which prompts one to reflect on how much more fun, though less of a shameless cash cow, such a film would have been, had at least some, if not all, of their romance had been shot au natural.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|A must read for all Richard Castle fans - this book is a brilliant extension of the TV series with the same cast of characters, albeit under different names.  All the same humour, style, nuances, personality traits and witty interaction that you've grown to love, is present in this book.  I thought it was amazingly clever how they tied the book into TV series and have actually produced something that people can buy and read for themselves.  And the amazing thing is that it's not actually half bad.  Sure, it's not going to win any literary awards, but it was still a superbly enjoyable and entertaining read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First let me say that I purchased both the Firefly series and the motion picture Serenity.  I watched the movie first and then the series.  Should have done this the other way around.  The third disc in the series had some digital breakup but Amazon, with amazing speed, replaced it with a new set that worked just fine.  In any case, this series was truly fantastic.  When I say that, I mean it was fantastic in every aspect.  The writing, language, acting, photography, sound effects and music came completely together.  Each of the fourteen episodes were a pleasure to watch and left one wanting more.  When you watch this series it gets you to think about what the series means.  It also leaves you to wonder how anyone could have considered cancelling a series that could easily have run for four to five more seasons.  Perhaps the series was ahead of it's time, in that television still had a lot of growing up to do.  There aren't many tv series that contain a message without damaging or limiting the entertainment value of the product.  This is a series that leaves you wanting more.  This is a series that will stand alone. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it highly.  If you have seen it, I can understand how you can wish for more.
B002ZG994U|1.0|- There's a lot of action and explosions but they're not exciting.    - There's no suspense or surprise either. It's just like any old action movies I've seen before. For example, there's a scene where a guy shooting from a tank dropped from a plane. I've seen it before but I don't remember in which movie.    - The acting is wooden.    In short, there's nothing worth watching here. It should be called \\"The D Team\\".
0786915749|1.0|Started pretty well then collapsed into a sorry mishmash of ludicrous 'adventures'. I saw so many 5 star ratings I was sure this would be good. Pitiful.

B000JIHP88|1.0|I bought this product because of the high ratings but the sound or music is very low. I can hardly hear it. I am exchanging it for a different one.
B002I9Z89Y|2.0|I debated whether to buy the DVD version or the Blu-Ray version. I chose the Blu-Ray because of the advertised feature that allows you to toggle back and forth between the remastered and original versions of the episodes. I figured it would be interesting to see exactly what had changed and how. Unfortunately, the feature does not work as advertised on my BD Player, a Panasonic DMP-BD65. It requires an Angle button on your remote control, which my remote doesn't have. There is also a menu  you can bring up that contains an option to switch from one version to another, but when I used that, it restarted each episode from the beginning. An Angle option on the BD player's function menu will toggle between episodes, but the menu covers half the screen, so half the picture isn't visible. A lesser, though annoying, issue is that when you stop the video during an episode, there is no way to return to the point you left off; the disk reinitializes when you next press Play (and Return doesn't work either). If you can verify in advance that these features will work on your BD player, go for the Blu-Ray. If you can't, stick with the DVD: you won't notice a significant difference in the picture quality, and -- from what I've read -- the contents are otherwise the same.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I admit when I first heard Sounds of the Universe I was wounded with a beating stomachache.  These guys including Alan are my heroes.  They're the one's who introduced poetry to me, unexpectedly one day, while watching MTV... I heard the song Precious for the first time and was blown away.<br /><br />I didn't know who this band was, until Playing the Angel debuted and I just had to buy it, but I accidentally bought Violator instead of Playing the Angel.  I was furious, because I wasn't use't to the difference of the sound and threw it away in my closet for years.<br /><br />I didn't appreciate them until I met a DM fan who introduced Only when I lose Myself, then I gave them another shot and since then I realized that I actually like all there music.  It's FUNNY how time changes.<br /><br />How I gave Sounds of the Universe another shot was this...  I listened to its hidden tracks Ghost, Light and Oh Well, then eventually I heard their remixes for SOTU.  My opinion is some of their remixes are better then some of their originals.<br /><br />What I've learned from them is I can't judge what they make so quickly.  I need to give them a lot of chances, until I finally can decide for sure.<br /><br />They truly are the best.  And without them music is nothing to me, but the other exceptions are: 16 Volt, Deftones, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead and The Doors.<br /><br />P.S.  Close your eyes and only pay attention to their lyrics.  It helps sometimes.
B000001FI7|5.0|I'm an old rock 'n roller from way back (the 60s...), and someone turned me on to Portishead back at the end of the 90s; It took me until just recently to re-listen to this masterful collection of songs: Truly singular, hypnotic, masterful and ultimately addictive. Buy this; you won't be able to stop listening to it; \\"Dummy...\\"
B00000J2PH|5.0|This album is truly a classic masterpiece. I was not able to get the original album back in the 1970's like I wanted so I was really excited to be able to receive it in the mail a few days ago. It was delivered brand new in it's factory wrapping. It has far exceeded what I expected. The sound quality is just beautiful and highlights Carole King's voice perfectly. The tones are so rich and vibrant. Ms. King really poured her heart and soul into each selection on this album and each song is a worthy listen. The price was also a pleasant surprise to me, a real bargain. This album is worth every star given.
0446569895|4.0|First \\"I AM Ozzy\\" was recommended to me by my sister she said she could not stop laughing. I have to be honest I laughed in parts but I did not find parts as funny as my sister but some parts you had to laugh at as they were unbelivable and pretty funny too.   My sister had given her copy to someone else so I ordered mine from amazon.  Amazon delivered my book promptly as usual.  I started reading it and I must say it immediately captures your attention (of course we are talking about Ozzy here.) Ozzy does not hold back in this book on telling his story from his point of view and from what he can recall in his lucid momemts of what happen back then. If you have followed Ozzy's career some of what is in this book would not shock you however, some still may. He gives eye opening accounts to what it was like to be inside of the mind Ozzy or what was in the mind of Ozzy. The book starts out with Ozzy talking about his father and it immediately goes into his first run in with the law (I won't give it away.) He takes you through his earlier days, his career and his first meeting with Sharon. As much as I have heard about Ozzy through the years there are things in this book only Ozzy could have told.  It appears Ozzy had a way of pushing himself to the end of a cliff and just as he is going to fall and tumble to his death a miracle happens and saves him from himself. He tells his story in a open honest way and states he is not that proud of some of the things he has done (YOU THINK?) The book is not for the weak hearted as they may get to disgusting parts and may not want to finish it.  But you must remember if you are reading it to begin with you already know a little about the history of Ozzy. If you really want to know more about the real Ozzy and not some of the false rummors and also find out somethings you would have never have known then I would recommend you read this book.  I am supprised they have not made a movie out of this yet.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|Finally, a thriller that actually thrills.  This is the best psychological thriller in the past decade. I could write a 10 page review to praise this film. However, I won't because I do have a life. If you want to see a great psychological and suspenseful thriller this film is a must see. The script, the acting and the direction are spectacular. This is one of those intellectual psych thrillers. Thus, if you are not intellectual you will not appreciate its nuances. Ryan Reynolds gives an Oscar worthy performance [I know!!!]. Two very enthusiastic thumps up!!!
B000005RFQ|5.0|easily  one of the best albums that this GREAT band has done !!! gillian manage his voice to \\"match\\" with sabbath\\"s  dark tones,\\"born again\\",\\"zero to hero\\", \\"disturbing the priest\\",\\"trashed\\",in a scale of 10 this  songs MUST have a 10, this has to be in your collection for sure !!!!
B001O2MBOQ|5.0|I would love to buy this movie, but there is NO WAY I am going to pay $159.00. That ridiculous.
006056251X|5.0|I first discovered Lisa Kleypas when I stumbled upon \\"Scandal in Spring.\\" Which is last of the Wallflower series. I adored that novel and didn't even realize that it was a part of a series. During Scandal I loved the character of Evie and the glimpses I saw of St. Vincent (not sure why since he was not a huge role in the storyline). So I was thrilled to realize they had their own story and that it was just the previous book of a SERIES! Made my day!  I picked up \\"Devil in Winter\\" and I could NOT put it down. I literally read it straight through. I loved the character of St. Vincent, I loved his sensuality. That scene after rescuing Evie from her family makes me swoon every time. He was cunning, protective, masculine, and sexy all rolled into one.   Now Evie is tied for first of my favorite heroines (Daisy Bowman being the other). I adored her because she was the most complex character. She came from a very abusive background. She was kind and gentle though. I loved her backbone and that she was able to say NO to the infamous rake. The one that no lady said no to, which of course just made her all the more irresistible to St. Vincent. He was taken by her subtle beauty and gentle spirit. I love how Lisa Klepas made her strong woman deep in her spirit despite that her family tried to crush her and yet she still had scars such as her stammer.   I loved the way Lisa Klepas wove their story and personalities together. I adore her writing as she is by far my favorite author. After I fell in love with \\"Devil\\" I went and read all the other books of the Wallflower series. I adore them as well making the series my top favorite and one I re-read over and over. Especially Devil and Scandal. I then moved on to the Hathaway Series and it is now my other favorite series and ones I re-read. I highly recommend them both but especially Devil in Winter. St. Vincent is my favorite Rake of all time!
B0042RUMIW|5.0|Absolutely fantastic concert and disc. No sense in describing - just see and listen for yourself.  Happy those who had an opportunity to see it live.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This DVD Product arrived in excellent condition and the service was very good thank you.  I would recommend this trader to anyone as they made my job easy for me.  Many  thanks and kind regards Geri
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Went to see with a friend and he pointed out that there is rain on the caboose windows throughout the movie, but never outside. We kept watching for the rain drops to dry up but never did.  Still a good movie, just an honest mistake.  Has anyone ever seen a poor Denzel Washington movie? He is a great actor.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|For those who don't know, the Rebuild of Evangelion series is a four-part theatrical remake of the infamous anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. Evangelion was a deconstruction of the Giant Robot genre. The original series was very much love it or hate it. The polarizing issues ranged from the characters' notorious pyscholgical problems, to the confusing final two episodes, to the show's use of rather horrific imagery, peppered with pieces of Christian and Kabbalistic symbolism, resulting in one of the most brutal, influential, and controversial examples of Anime. I liked the original series, but I was fully aware of its flaws, and I considered it to be a flawed masterpiece.     Now onto Rebuild of Evangelion. Evangelion 1.0 sums up the first 6 episodes, with the continuity changed slightly, and the Angel fights given a massive makeover. I enjoyed it very much, and while it is very similar to the original, it sets the stage for Evangelion 2.0.     Now as for Eva 2.0...   IT. IS. AMAZING! This film seriously ranks among my all time favorite movies. It fully brings the Rebuild series into its own. It composes of roughly episodes 7-19. This results in many of the Angel fights being cut, but a couple new Angels are added as well, but the timing feels well-paced. It also addresses the show's polarizing aspects. The infamously broken characters are given some well placed adjustments. For example, Asuka in the original was known for being a rather narcissitic bitch with a very traumatic childhood. But in Eva 2.0, some of her more redeeming qualities are shown. The second half the the movie drastically alters the continuity with the original show, revealing that Rebuild will truly shine as its own work, instead of just remaking the original. I don't want to spoil anything, but after seeing this you will have a newfound respect for our hero, everyone's favorite whiner, Shinji Ikari. The ending is one of those rare combinations of heartwarming and terrifying, with a helping of badass. Compare that to the original ending, which was notoriously confusing, or the concluding movie End of Evangelion, which was just plain terrifying.     I recommend this to all Anime fans, but especially to those who've seen the original, whether they liked it or not. An absoloutly mind-blowing experience.
B0040JHWKS|3.0|The Promise is a notepad containing the ideas and hard work that went into making Darkness. The laid back Racing in the Street doesn't compare to the Darkness version and even takes a moment to realize that's the same song. An enjoyable couple of hours listening to the artist polishing his style and building an album. Maybe it wasn't intended to be released but what better history lesson than hearing the roots of Sprinsteen? You have to start somewhere.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I saw Black Swan last night. Although it was a powerful movie that kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire time, I went away not knowing which parts were real and which were hallucinations of Nina Sayers, expertly played by Natalie Portman.<br /><br />Although this story is about ballet, the rehearsal and backstage scenes reminded me of my opera chorus experiences. However, those experiences made me question the accuracy of showing a principal alone in a dressing room without assistance with makeup or costume changes. The plot depended on her being alone. Could this happen? Or, was it another hallucination?
B003UESJH4|5.0|I didn't want this movie to end. The King's Speech was an incredibly moving story of friendship and overcoming lifelong fears. The authentic and poignant performances of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush made the movie. They were superb!
B0000032LS|5.0|Quite simply,<br /><br />Rocky Horror started out as a fun, campy film;<br /><br />You want to hear the songs because they remind you of the fun of going to the movie/play and<br /><br />It conveys nostalgia.<br /><br />In reality, these are great rock and pop songs in their own right and improve with age. Even without the reference to the visuals, these are great, great songs.<br /><br />If you have even a remote affinity for the movie, buy this soundtrack since these songs will grow on you.<br /><br />I dare you to listen to \\"Timewarp\\" and not sing and dance along!
0545265355|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. The first book took a little while to get into, the second one I couldn't put down and finished it the same day I started it, and the third took me a bit longer because I had to give myself breaks from what was happening. I became very invested in the characters. I highly recommend this series.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Trust the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this item. It more than lives up to the hype. It's everything I was looking for in a camera backpack. And, it doesn't have the Canon 'Steal-me' logo. If you're in the market for a camera backpack under $100, choose this one.
B00005J73X|4.0|`One Wild Night' is a pretty good live collection from Bon Jovi, offering a selection of tracks between 1985 and 2001. It is always great to hear an audience singing along with a bands every song and say what you will about Jon Bon Jovi, he knows how to get a crowd fired up and enjoying themselves. This covers most bases by offering classics like `Living on a Prayer', `Bad Medicine' and `Wanted Dead or Alive', whilst also offering more up to date tracks (at time of the album release). Personal favourites have to include `Something to Believe In' and `It's My Life' but that's simply because I love those songs. There are two covers here and although `Rocking In The Free World ` is a great song I tend to feel it would have been better to leave these covers out and add two extra Bon Jovi songs to the collection, they have so many good rock tracks to offer it seems a shame to play someone else's songs on this live CD. This is a great album for summer and the live element, coupled with the slightly rockier edge to the performance (rather than the sometimes softer playing on album versions) makes for an upbeat and fun CD. If you're a fan of Bon Jovi you won't be disappointed and if you like their stuff but only want one album with a good selection of tracks, then this is one of the places to go.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00006LWSF|4.0|`8 Mile' is the soundtrack from the film of the same name and as you'd expect from a film starring Eminem, this CD features him on various tracks, as well as being produced by him. To be strict with the term this isn't quite a soundtrack (as the cover points out) as this also includes many tracks that were inspired by the film, but that doesn't detract from the solid music on offer. You get a wide variety of artists, including Eminem, Obie Trice, 50 Cent, D12, Jay-Z, xzibit, Macy Gray, Nas, Boomkat, Rakim, Young Zee and Gangstarr. All pretty notable artists at the time the film was released. Some songs are better than others and the quality of the lyrical content fluctuates from track to track, some artists are obviously better than others! For a good introduction into Hip Hop I'd say this is a good place to turn, it has enough variety to keep you interested and to help you make up your mind about what artists and style you like. It is also a good place to turn if you liked the music in the film and want more of the same. A solid collection of music and worth a look if you're after a hip hop compilation.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0030Y10QQ|3.0|It's great seeing this greatest hits collection, but as a die-hard fan I was disappointed. The packinging is nice, but has a couple major flaws.<br /><br />First, there's no personnel listing so unless you're familiar with the band's personnel changes over the year you're not going to either learn who is in the band nor who plays on what song from this collection.<br /><br />Second, Savatage had many great 'hits', but really hits here translates to 'fan favorites' as their radio play was minimal and never really had chart success ... until their release 'Dead Winter Dead' and the overnight success of the song \\"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\\". Compared to the success of this song, which would lead to the creation of Trans-Siberian Orchestra and the death of Savatage, they really never had any 'hits'. So, that being said, it's shocking to see a 2 CD collection of hits ... and the exclusion of \\"Christmas Eve...\\" Yes, that's right. The one song they are known for is missing.<br /><br />I really don't want to to complain about the song selection, but outside of the missing \\"Christmas Eve\\" the song selection is odd. It's misses this key hit but includes three post-Savatage acoustic recordings. Further, this is not an overview for the band. Their debut album is missing, let alone some major later career (Al Pitrelli era) 'fan favorites'. It's nearly impossible to list all the great songs by Savatage though without a boxset so in some ways I forgive them.<br /><br />I bought the 2 CD set not the CD/DVD set as I already have the Japanese concert on DVD. Though, what's interesting is that the concert features Alex Skolnick who never recorded with the band. What would be better is a DVD of numerous video clips from over the entire career, featuring Alex, yes, plus his replacement Al Pitrelli, plus earlier days with Criss Oliva along with the obscure final tour with Damond Jiniya and Al's successor Frank Frost (two other folks that didn't record with the band.)<br /><br />If you want to discover Savatage I'd personally go for their individual albums starting with Power Of The Night, Gutter Ballet, Dead Winter Dead, The Wake Of Magellan<br /><br />Instead of this greatest hits I wish they'd release some of the live concerts that some of us have only been able to get on bootleg DVD. There's nothing quite like hearing Zak Stevens duet with Jon Oliva on the old songs that didn't happen on the studio recordings.u want to discover Savatage I'd personally go for their individual albums starting with Power Of The Night, Gutter Ballet, Dead Winter Dead, The Wake Of Magellan<br /><br />Instead of this greatest hits I wish they'd release some of the live concerts that some of us have only been able to get on bootleg DVD.

B000JSI7BM|3.0|`The Devil Wears Prada' is a pretty inoffensive chick flick that manages to stand out from the crowd and keeps you engaged without being too schmaltzy or overly `Hollywood'. Following Ann Hathaway's character, Andy, who is an aspiring journalist, with minimal fashion sense, who joins a fashion magazine as the PA to the ogre of a boss (played by Meryl Streep) this film is quickly set up for plenty of laughs and over the top fashion flamboyance. I've found Hathaway quite annoying in past films but she is actually very good in this film and plays her part very well. Streep's other PA is also hilarious with her back biting and sniping. Andy is asked to perform various outrageous tasks for her demanding boss and soon struggles to juggle home and work life and this leads to the crux of the film. How will she resolve her dilemma whilst maintaining her integrity? This film has some good laughs and cutting sarcastic wit from Streep and is good for a couple of hours viewing. It is easy going, not too heavy and great for a lazy afternoon. It may be pretty innocuous but it never tried to be too high brow or anything other than what it is, simple chick flick fun.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0042816YK|5.0|Thought there would me more fluff and not so much real things people go through in life. Although the star does it with not much thought to how things get paid for, it still stuck deep into what each of us is searching for. The meaning we each give to the world is determined by each of us. I watched the movie 3 times in a row,,,,,,, and I am not even a fan of Julia. I bet the book is great.but watch the DVD, and you get the point.
B0017APPSO|4.0|`Persepolis' is a simply drawn, yet powerful animation that, mainly in black and white, develops the story using bold silhouettes and simple lines. This film follows Marji as she grows up amidst the turmoil and history of the Iranian revolution. It initially explores the politics of that region at that time, before looking at life in Europe where Marji goes into exile. Finally Marji returns to Iran and you experience the alienation and dissatisfaction she feels as she tried to readjust to Iranian life. As a child Marji is inquisitive and endearing and her sense of independence, although lost at times, is never far below the surface as she grows up. This film has many funny moments that juxtaposes with the sadder themes of the film to make both more resonant and although the film is quite dark and bleak at time, it is important to the overall feel. Saying that, there are numerous small visual touches that add to the humour and charm within this film and make watching it a true delight. Exploring important themes in a charming, eloquent and insightful way, `Persepolis' makes for exceptional animated art and required viewing if you're a fan of the genre.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000001EC1|4.0|For your first taste of what Bon Jovi has to offer then `Crossroad', like many best of's, is probably the best place to start. Covering the bands career up to the `Keep the Faith' album, this album has a good selection of tracks, as well as two new ones for this collection. You get all the bands well known hits from `Living on a Prayer' and `Keep the Faith' to `You Give Love a Bad Name' and `Bad Medicine', as well as one track from Jon Bon Jovi's first solo project. Sadly a track from Sambora's solo album was neglected, but I guess space on an album is tight. Putting this on in the car recently made me realise just how good this band could be and at their height they were a force to be reckoned with. You can't help but sing along at full volume and I'm always in awe of Sambora's guitar playing (check out his excellent solo albums). For that perfect slice of hard pop/light rock then this is a great place to go and this makes for one awesome collection of tracks, you get a taste of the softer and harder sides of Bon Jovi and makes you realise just how good they were.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|`Magic' is a Sprinsgteen album with great song writing but diabolical production. Never has a Boss album sounded so flat and uninspired and you can tell this has been produced for the mp3 market with it's boosted signals and lack of nuance. But anyway, the actual songs on offer live up to Bruce's excellent back catalogue and this is one album that gets better with repeated listening. The opening track, and first single released from the album, `Radio Nowhere' has a great feel and lets you know from the off what type of Springsteen album this will be. Full on rock. Personal favourites are `Long Walk Home' and `Devil's Arcade' with the way they build and some excellent guitar playing. This album is yet again packaged in the terrible digi-pack format which, although may be environmentally friendly, are prone to bending and being compressed, but I can look past this for the music on offer. Like I say, this album is one that gets better the more you listen to it and it makes for great summer listening. A solid outing from Springsteen to show the fans he's still got it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0046MOV8U|1.0|THIS IS NOT A CONCERT FOOTAGE AT ALL, IT FEELS LIKE A DOCUMENTARY WITH PERFORMANCES (FROM DIFFERENT VENUES AND DATES) MIXED UP WITH \\"CONFESSIONS\\" AND STUPID COMMENTARIES FILMED BACKSTAGE. WHY DIDNT SHE RELEASE THE ENTIRE CONCERT WITH EXTRAS? I WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR THIS BUT HATED THIS BLURAY EVEN THOUGH I TOTALLY LOVE BEYONCE.
B001PPLJJ0|4.0|`The Reader' is the film that finally won Winslett her Oscar and it has to be said that her performance in this film is very worthy. Saying that, all of the performance's from all involved are very strong and the direction is superb as well. The Amazon synopsis explains the story very well, as do other reviews here, but suffice to say this is a richly woven story with an interesting analysis of human nature. Most WW2 or holocaust films can be particularly harrowing and although this is also the case with this film (but only in places) the emphasis is most definitely on the human relationships involved rather than graphic details of cruelty. The relationship between the young Michael and Hanna is intriguing to watch, with an unusual dynamic that is explained as the film develops and you begin to understand why she enjoys being read to so much. The relationship between them when Michael is an adult is more complex and conducted from afar and both these aspects of their relationship are portrayed extremely well. This is quite slow going in places but is worth persevering with and this makes for a couple of hours good viewing and engrossing drama. Well worth a try and worth the plaudits it has received.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1594202842|4.0|I am Chinese and was surrounded by parenting styles similar to Mrs. Chua's. I was brought up with the exact opposite type of parenting style. Part of the appeal of the book for me was that I wished had more of a structured upbrigning, but definitely not to the extreme of Mrs. Chua. One of my favorite parts was when the family took the trip to meet Mrs. Vamos; it was hysterical for many personal reason, but overall, I enjoyed the book very much!  In the end, it is apparent how much Mrs. Chua loves her children and is so right on the money when she discusses the obligations of caring for family members.
B000002KD9|5.0|`After the Gold Rush' is one of those seminal albums and required listening for fans of Neil Young, both existing and new. This is the album that really kicked off his solo career and it has some great songs on it. Neil Young sings in his usual plaintive style and his vocals suit the themes of the songs perfectly. I love `Southern Man' which was his indictment of deep south bigotry and it has some excellent guitar towards the end. `Don't Let It Bring You Down' is another standout track as well. Written before his super successful `Harvest' album, this album shows where Neil Young's style was heading and these two album compliment each other superbly. To go back to Neil Young's roots this is a great place to start, it has plenty of his early folk style playing and engaging lyrics as well, that I enjoy reading along with the songs for the poetry they create. Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

0307389839|4.0|`What I Talk About When I Talk About Running' is a part running and part writing memoir from Haruki Murakami and although relatively short it kept me engrossed the whole way through. This follows Murakami as he talks about how he started running and how he trains for various events. It also looks at how his running has affected his writing and how one often helps the other. It is made up of many short essays that follow on from one another and flow well chronologically and sit well together as a complete book. It is written in a deceptively simple way and although this has many short sentences, each one is expertly crafted and is describes what he is writing about perfectly. He also talks about his triathlon training which breaks up the book slightly and adds to the overall dynamic of the book. His tenacity whilst running ultra marathons is impressive and his resolves in maintaining his training schedule, come what may, should be an inspiration for those of us (I.e. all of us) runners who struggle to get out of the door sometimes. The part where he runs the Athens to Marathon route was especially good but to be honest this is packed full of many such stories to keep you reading and interested. I'd suggest you will enjoy this more if you run regularly, but that is in no way a prerequisite and you can enjoy this just as much if you are a couch potato. Well worth checking out.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00004W510|4.0|Look, I came to The Band through Rock of Ages. Out here in Australia no one had heard of them when Big Pink came out and anyone who tells you that they knew about them in 1968 (in the land of surfing and innocence) is just being disingenuous. But once I heard Rock of Ages I just had to get back to the source. This album is one of three parts of that source. Big Pink and Stage Fright are the other two. This album is wonderful. It is up there with Revolver, Let It Bleed and Blonde on Blonde. But Big Pink is THE ONE. It is unsurpassable. I can see why Clapton was so blown away. If you haven't heard The Band get this album!! It is an experience that listeners simply do not get today. As Duke Ellington famously said of himself, it is music \\" beyond category\\". When you have been suitably blown away by this, get Big Pink. That is nirvana. Oh and Yes, I am a fan.
B00030590I|4.0|`Hero' is a film that, whilst stunningly beautiful and with amazing cinematography, is one that can only be fully enjoyed the first time around. Sadly it loses it's impact with repeated viewing. Following an assassin who attempts to kill the emperor this film has plenty of plot twists and intrigue. Coupled with the vivid colours, incredible locations and set design and flawless fight choreography this makes for one visual feast. I've come to realise that however amazing the fight scenes are, they are less impressive second time round and they actually drag by the end of the film. Scene after scene of flowing combat, however graceful, become tiresome after a while. Luckily this film has a strong enough plotline to sustain it. Jet Li is great in the main role and all the supporting actors are highly admirable as well. This film is very much in the vein of others produced around this time ('Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon`, `House of Flying Daggers' and `Curse of the Golden Flower') I.e. it has lush, rich colours, awe inspiring costume design and the cinematography/direction is highly polished. This makes for a short, but captivating film and although it may lose it's charm after the first time you watch it, that first time is so breath taking it more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0060254920|5.0|Although the colors won't jump out at you, the illustrations and storyline are captivating. I can read this book the whole way through and discuss the pictures and happenings without my little ones budging for a second. A good buy.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|`The Fall' is a simply stunning film that left me feeling breathless and enraptured with it`s beauty. The plot follows a girl in a hospital who is told a fantasy story by another patient and the film flicks back and forth between the harsh reality of the hospital and the wonderful fantasy of the adventure Roy (the patient) weaves. The sub plot follows Roy as he recovers from his own illness and the deeper meaning for the reasons behind the story he tells, which leads to the two plots being brought together at the end. It has rich, vivid colours, amazing locations, incredible costumes and a strong engrossing storyline. I like the way characters who work in and around the hospital also feature in the story being told and how as the girl asks questions the fantasy changes to accommodate them. This film is very reminiscent of `Pans Labyrinth', with the strong fantasy element and unique adult fairy tale feel and I'd suggest that if you liked that film it is a strong bet you will enjoy this one also. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film quite as much as I did and this made a for a couple of hours highly enjoyable viewing. Highly recommended indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I am a runner and have been in a constant search for headphones.  I have had pair after pair fail for me.  Either they do not stay in my ears, or they are painful, or they do not last and quit working.  After reading many reviews, I decided to try these as my next pair.  So far, I agree with the reviews I read on these.  They are pretty comfortable and stay in my ears.  The sound is good and I like how light weight and flexible they are.  I read some reviews that they only last a year or so, so i decided to just order two pairs.  I have only had them about a month, so I cannot speak to longevity, but so far so good!  And if they only last a year, I will not be upset for headphones that cost under $9!  I would recommend them to any other runners looking for headphones!
B001AQR3IU|5.0|`Stardust' is a wonderful fairytale that you can completely lose yourself in and enjoy the magical world created for you. I was surprised at just how good this film was and it reminded me of the fantasy adventures I watched and loved as a child and that never seemed to be beaten by modern films. The cast is great with Pfiefer, De Niro, Claire Danes and a whole host of British comedy actors to bolster this already impressive role call. This has a great story about a boy falling in love with a falling star and how he has to protect her from witches and evil princes' who wish to find her for their own sinister reasons. This is a VERY basic description of the storyline and the various twist and turns make for a spellbinding and captivating story. It is acted well by all involved, the direction is superb, the special effects match the fairytale and magic themes perfectly and the overall package achieves what it sets out to extremely well. I was heartily impressed by this film and all the more so for not expecting it to be as good as it was. This is a top fantasy adventure and makes for an afternoons excellent entertainment for all the family.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0042816YK|3.0|You'll love the scenery in this movie - especially of course ROME with Bali second. I think there was great effort by the director to make you feel like you're there too.    It doesn't matter that I read the book. This movie leaves far too much of the relationships to the imagination. Especially the two most important relationships of the main character, Liz. First we discover that Liz is unhappy in her marriage, but we're not exactly sure why. The dialogue makes an effort to try to fill us in... but we've arrived at the very end of the marriage and aren't privy to the WHY.    What kinda bothers me about the character, Liz, is that she jumps right into another relationship while going through her divorce, but this time we see it through from beginning to end and STILL aren't privy to the \\"fights\\" they later discuss when breaking up.    Do not read further if you don't want the story ruined...    Liz's next relationship evolves the same way ... but there's no chemistry that I can see - although they seem to pretend there is - here it really seems like acting. The Brazilian boyfriend seems too course for her... he seems just WRONG... that's not to say I haven't seen this actor in other movies and thought he was fantastic... it's just that with Julia Roberts it doesn't work. But apparently as the movie ends, he's \\"the one\\". After less than a year in which she broke up her marriage, ended her interim relationship, she has found Mr. IT? It's too fairy tale for me... but this is supposedly based on a true story so I guess it's possible. I've been married and divorced... it's not often that people rebound so quickly. That amazes me... it's just not my own experience. For me this movie left me cold... I didn't feel this woman had truly progressed emotionally... she just jumped from partner to partner. And I felt the same way reading the book.
B00005AFVR|4.0|`Live in New York' is one of the first places I go when I want to hear Bruce but don't fancy a specific album. This provides a great selection of tracks from his New York concerts and all with an amazing audience reaction. Although this is pieced together form various shows and you get the occasional fade-in, it still sounds good and works well as a complete album. Standout tracks are easily the rendition of `The River' which has the most beautiful and mournful harmonica intro you'll ever hear, `Tenth Avenue Freeze Out' with it's preacher/gospel revival feel, 'Jungleland' for that solo alone and `41 Shots' for it's emotion and story, although the whole album is pretty good to be honest. Bruce always puts on a good show and if you have seen him live, or the DVD of this show, then you know how much he gives an audience and how much they love him back. This CD shows that aspect well and you can really feel the audience atmosphere. If you're looking for a live album of Bruce then I'd initially ignore the triple album he released in the eighties (which is cut from many shows and doesn't sit well together as an album) and head here first. This has fun, great music and Bruce's energy in spades. Just make sure you check out his `Hammersmith Odeon' CD at some point to see how he performed early in his career and how the energy is just as high now.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0044KI7B6|3.0|The show is getting slower and repetitive. The first episode went almost 30 minutes without a hunt. Also, they are once again having Sam and Dean \\"break up.\\" That's getting very boring. It's not even a \\"new\\" dimension anymore. Also, the first episode had about 5 new characters. Dizzying. This show is going to lose to Fringe. I still love the Winchesters.
B000002MJR|5.0|After many happy hours watching the DVD of this concert with my best friend it was a foregone conclusion that I'd also buy the CD to add to my collection and I've never regretted it and never get tired listening to it. From the album opener `Calling Elvis' with that constant underlying pedal steel riff and tongue in cheek quacking percussion (you'll know what I mean when you hear it) to the awesome `Heavy Fuel' and `On Every Street' (with more amazing pedal steel from Paul Franklin) this concert has a great selection of tracks from the `On Every Street' album. It also has some firm favourites like `Walk of Life', `Romeo and Juliet', `Private Investigation', `Money for Nothing' and `Brothers in Arms' to round of the track selection in style. Knopflers guitar playing is as tight and inspiring as ever and the tone he manages to wring out of his Pensa Suhr guitars is nothing but breath taking. From the sound of the audience they are obviously enjoying themselves, as are all the musicians and this album never fails to lift my spirits. Sadly this has less tracks than the DVD, mainly due to the restrictions of space on the CD format, but for a slice of live Dire Straits this really can't be beaten and it is still a favourite live album of mine all these years later. Simply incredible.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Other reviewers have compared Outlander to the story of Beowulf.  They are missing the boat.  This is a much more complex story.  The producer/director did not pick Jim Caviezel to play the lead by accident.  The key to the story is the conflicted inner wounds carried by Caviezel.  He is torn by guilt, driven by hatred.  Only an actor of Caviezel's caliber and range could convincingly portray a man racked by opposing emotional drives and exhibit the depth of his inner suffering.  This is primarily an action film, yes, but it delves into issues of culpability, self-advancement, the stultifying horror of personal loss, the ignominity of causing incalculable suffering to others, the drive for redemption and self-renewal.  This is what the story is really about, and I found it admirable that the creators reached well-beyond the stereotypical sci-fi monster/horror story to give the audience a lot of material to contemplate.  I had heard nothing about this movie, and I read only a couple of so-so reviews; nevertheless, I bought it outright on a gamble.  This was compulsive, but I got lucky.  I just wish my other whimsical purchases turned out to be half this good.
B0037XPP84|4.0|`Elizabeth: The Golden Age' is the perfect example of history as entertainment and although the authenticity of the history may take second place to the entertainment, this still makes for engrossing viewing. Following Queen Elizabeth in her middle years this films explores the romance of Sir Walter Raleigh, the Catholic assassination plots, Mary Queen of Scots treason and the Spanish Armada. The costumes and sets are stunning and are the key aspects that really makes this film. Blanchett's performance is as good as the first film (which you don't have to have seen to enjoy this film) and the supporting cast do an ample job at providing the drama and intrigue to the storylines. Clive Owen is especially good as the lovable rogue, Raleigh, and is very credible after seeing him in less impressive roles in other films. The veracity of the history may be in doubt, but the adventure and drama in the story more than make up for this and as long as you are aware of it, this film makes for a couple of hours of good viewing. Worth a try if you enjoyed the first instalment.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|I don't know what this conveys, but I saw Spider-Man 3 when it was released to theaters.  I only just recently bought the movie and watched it for a second time.  Surprisingly, I remembered almost nothing about it.  I felt as if I were watching some entirely new film.  Does that suggest the film is forgettable or that my brain synapses have really deteriorated?  In any event, I enjoyed the movie very much and was glad I made the purchase. Writing this at 1/29/11, I am already aware that the fourth Spider-Man will not feature any of the original cast or its director.  I don't want to pan something that hasn't been produced yet, but it's difficult to see how any production team can top the trilogy already in existence.  Above all, I credit Tobey Maguire for bringing to life Peter Parker and Spider-Man.  I seriously doubt that the Spider-Man franchise would have continued without Tobey.  His unique on-screen presence and subtle multi-dimensional characterization brought a distinct, charismatic quality to the web-slinger.  Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson was also exactly on the money.  The studio (Sony?) threw a proven, winning group of professionals to the wind.  If Spidey 4 bombs, it wouldn't come as a shock.  Anyway, Spider-Man 3 is a real roller-coaster ride.  The movie is fun, exhilarating, sentimental at times -- and keeping well in step with the comic book series.  The final scene with Tobey and Kristen dancing slowly was poignant, knowing that this was the last time we'd see these fine actors in the same roles.  Good luck to them all.
B000069HKH|5.0|Written in response to the events of 911 `The Rising' offers up some exceptional tracks from Bruce that combine his usual high quality song writing with some poignant lyrics. These lyrics are not too `in your face' and subtlety is definitely the key element here, you could quite easily listen to this album and not focus on the inspiration for it. The album opener `Lonesome Day' starts you off in good stead and this album has a good mix of fast and slow songs. Standout tracks for me are `Further on (Up The Road) which has a great upbeat feel to it, the title track and `My City of Ruins' which is a beautiful way to end this album. There are various editions of this album (all of which I own) and this tour edition with the additional DVD is worth a look. It includes the music video for `Lonesome Day' as well as other tracks preformed live. You don't get too much extra on the DVD, but for an all round package it is probably still worth paying slightly more for this edition. If you're a fan of Bruce you won't be disappointed and if you're new to him then this isn't that bad a place to start either. One of those albums that still sounds fresh and relevant almost 10 years later.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|First off, Spartacus - Blood & Sand will go on!  HOWEVER, sadly it will not be with Andy Whitfield.  I will definitely miss him.  He was a great actor, and he is Spartacus. Starz plans to replace him with 29 year old Liam McIntyre, an Austrailian actor who does have an impressive likeness to Whitefield... but will it work?  With how people are hesitant when it comes to change, especially when fans adore Whitfield as they do, well it may be hard to swallow this pill.  But this new leading man can act at least, and with his likeness (and for many who may be worried, his 'yummieness') is close to Andy Whitfield's... so maybe after a few episodes air, Blood & Sand will be highly accepted once more. At least for me, I personally hope that comes to pass, because the show was magnificent.  However, I'll admit that I'm just as skeptic as most of you will be, mainly because Andy was amazing in the role, but only time will tell.   TO ANDY:  You're a remarkable man... he said that he wanted the show to go on with out him... that the story needed to be told.  GOD BLESS YOU MAN, I, as well as all your fans, wish you well in the future and to win your fight with cancer.    Now on to the Gods of the Arena... well honestly, I LOVE IT!  It lacks the original gravity of the show, however when it truly comes down it, this is a different show.  Perhaps a better title would have been SPARTACUS: Batiatus & Lucretia's Reign, or something of the like... because this show is more focused thus far on how the lanista becomes noteworthy for the games, as well as the rise of Crixus and how Oenomaus becomes doctore.  And I'm also assuming how his wife must die later, (possibly at the hands of the increasingly evil Batiatus in a later episode???... maybe not... this review is only 2 episodes in after all).    Enough speculation though.  We already know the houses' fate.  However, it is intersting to see how that fate truly is justice, not just through the wrongs the couple commit via Blood & Sand, but their prior crimes as well.  Plus, it adds to their development, and gives more insight on Crixus's character.   I for one liked the Lucretica and Batiatus, they were awful, yet very entertaining, so this is a bonus for me, and I'm sure a number of other fans of the show feel the same way.  Plus, it is a great filler until Blood & Sand season 2 premiers in early 2012, yes very long wait =(     I'll watch it though.  You can't opiniate a premier without viewing it... I may not want to view the rest, but I'll at least give the season opening a shot.  (Think the new American Idol, I've never watched more than 1 episode, if that, per season, and still dont by the way.  But what, 20ish other million americans have, and continue to do so.  Most were skeptical of Jennifer Lopez & Steven Tyler coming in, but from what I've read online and heard on the radio, they're starting to change their tunes... maybe the new Blood & Sand will surprise us all).
B001LF4IA6|4.0|`Working on a Dream' is the latest offering from Bruce (at time of writing) and follows on pretty much where `Magic' left off, but with the benefit of less intrusive production this time round. The album opener `Outlaw Pete' is a great way to kick things off and I love it despite the irritatingly catchy main refrain! The title track, in my opinion, is probably the weakest track on the album and always surprises me that the album was named after it, but that's why I'm not in musical marketing. `Good Eye' is Bruce's homage to `Crossroads' and is one of the most overtly bluesy tracks he has done in a long while, but with a rocky edge to it. One of my favourites on the album is `Kingdom of Day's and this is the one that feels most Springsteen-esque to me, it definitely harks back to previous songs of his. `Queen of the Supermarket' is also a very strong offering and this album finally closes with the bonus track `The Wrestler` from the film of the same name. Overall this album throws up no real surprises and although it is very good, it is not one of his best. It won't be one I'll immediately be coming back to when I fancy that instant hit of Bruce, but it is one to be enjoyed and replayed at various times over the coming months when the mood takes you. Good but not great.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1591843162|3.0|Brief and to the point...This book repeats itself way too much.  It could be much shorter as a result.  The idea that a linchpin is an artist is an interesting one at first but is somewhat silly. The entire book tells you over an over again that a linch pin is an artist.  OK, got it the first time.  What else? The summary at the end of the book is very weak.  I have read a lot of \\"self help\\" books and this is one of my favorites.  Some other reviewer mentioned that this work is all about the authors love of self promotion.  I would tend to agree.  Being an artist in this economy is not going to save yor job.  It might even get you layed off sooner.
B000N3AXQU|4.0|`Rocky Balboa' is a pretty credible addition to the Rocky series which has a decent story, decent direction and decent acting from Stallone. Considering he wrote, directed and starred in this film that's not bad going at all. Following Rocky as he fights a comeback `exhibition' fight with the reigning world champion, this film has plenty of fight scenes and Rocky training with the usual rousing soundtrack to add to the atmosphere. Stallone shows Rocky's motivation for wanting to fight again and his relationship with his son to good effect and the whole film builds on the Rocky franchise, whilst also redeeming itself against some of the more dubious sequels. Overall, if you're a fan of the Rocky films this shouldn't disappoint and if you're new to Rocky you can still watch this and get some enjoyment out of it without being aware of the full back story. Worth a look.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Bought this book for my son and he loved it. A classic Frankenstein book. Great writer and easy to read.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|`Gran Torino' is quite simply one of the best films I have seen in quite some time. Directed by, produced by and starring Clint Eastwood, this film has a feeling of gravitas and meaning from the word go. This follows Walt Kowalski, who is a Korean war veteran, and how has he seen the neighbourhood around him change over the years and how he has seen a rise in violence and intimidation. It also looks at how he faces his own prejudices about his Hmong neighbours and strikes a relationship with the family next door. It is touching to see Walt develop from the archetype grumpy old man, to seeing someone with a softer side and with a great deal of compassion for those who are in a worse situation than himself. Clint plays Walt gruff and old school from the outset and you often laugh at his up front honesty, especially when confronted with a do-good catholic priest, but he isn't a one trick pony and manages to show his considerable acting (and directing) skills throughout. This may be Clint's swansong film, but considering the calibre of films he is making at the moment it would be a great shame if that was so. This has a powerful ending that will resonate long after the credits have rolled and will have you coming back to it in your mind at odd times in the days after you watch the film. This may be a scathing indictment of modern life in some cities, but it also has a well written storyline with impact and power. Needless to say, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I almost well up with tears when I look at behind-the-scenes clips from this movie.  Edgar Wright and Co. put a unfathomable amount of effort into making this film, and it crashed horribly in theaters.  This is a astounding movie by all means, but America/The World, had no interest in seeing it.  Some blame it on marketing, but I argue that the general public wasn't ready for such a odd/ambitious film.  You don't really know what Scott Pilgrim is till you read it or see it.  I asked people who never read comics what they thought of the trailer, and they all thought it was garbage.  This is because the concept may seem a little goofy, but the end result was so fascinating.  All that remains now is a cult classic that was payed for only by the Scott Pilgrim readers for the most part.  At least us fans got the treat of a lifetime.<br /><br />The Disc:<br /><br />Edgar always stuffs way too much material on his blu-rays, but that seems to be ok this time around.  SP's whopping 4 commentaries were all entertaining, unlike Shaun of the Dead's.  The featurettes were all very interesting, and I wasn't bored at all while watching them.  The MAJOR flaw with the disc is an aspect ratio problem where text cuts out on the sides of the screen.  I haven't quite learned to accept that problem.<br /><br />The Film:<br /><br />Scott Pilgrim is one of the best comic book movies, and it certainly was one of the hardest to adapt.  They had to cram 7 villains into the movie, and cover a lot of material, while also being true to the tone of the books.  Edgar Wright did a fantastic job, and I promise you no one was better for the job.  I also argue with the Cera haters, by saying that Michael was the best one for the job.  He gave the movie something it would have been missing.  The variable.  It would have been such a literal adaptation, or a boring adaptation without him.  His own flair gave the flick a whole new dimension.  The fight scenes are good, but I hold my least favorites at the end, while the second fight is the best.  The action overall is a lot of fun, but nothing to jump up and down about.  What is important and fresh here, is the comedy.  The humor is unlike any comedy I've seen, including Edgar Wright's previous films.  It's a bubbly, sarcastic masterpiece, filled with gutbursters.  The other great thing to note about this movie is all the video-game references.  It gives the casual gamer a nerd-gasm.<br /><br />It's absolutely worth its money.  One of the best movies of 2010, and one of the best comic book movies of all time, Scott Pilgrim is extremely entertaining if you are brave enough to watch it.  Don't be the general audience who settle for such mediocrity as The Expendables.  Venture out and you will be rewarded.  Scott Pilgrim is unlike anything you've seen before.  That's why they call it a game-changer.the best.  The action overall is a lot of fun, but nothing to jump up and down about.  What is important and fresh here, is the comedy.

B00000I07R|5.0|`Keep the Faith' is probably Bon Jovi's best album and the one I go back to the most from their back catalogue. I stopped buying their albums after `Crush' and `Keep the Faith' really was the bands peak. From the two opening tracks `Believe' and `Keep the Faith' you know that the band could still rock out when they wanted to and the ballad `Bed of Roses' just manages to pull it off without getting too cheesy. The highlight has to be `Dry County' and Sambora's solo is without a doubt truly outstanding. In fact Sambora's solo albums are excellent and are well worth checking out. Overall this is an excellent album and I was always disappointed that after the `These Days' album (which is also excellent) Bon Jovi never quite managed to live up to their former glory. If you want some good time rock music, with excellent guitar playing and before Bon Jovi got overblown and too into themselves, then this is the place to go. I still love it all these years later.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0014DFCMS|5.0|A wonderful coming of age movie!  I wish I had had Juno's wisdom when I went through much the same situation!  Very entertaining!
B001U0HBPG|4.0|`The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' is a long, but compelling film that probably has one of Brad Pitts's best performances to date. Following the life of Benjamin Button who is born old and gets younger as the years go by, the story is certainly unique. You see how he deals with aspects of his `affliction' and the various relationships he forges throughout his life, as well as the experiences that colour his life and personality. Cate Blanchett is also excellent in this film and the interaction between her and Benjamin is poignant and touching. The special effects are pretty good but in no way detract from the story being told and the make-up is exceptional. This film has a very gentle, almost sedate, pace to it, which makes some portions drag slightly, but nothing excessively so and the original storyline keeps you engrossed when normally your attention may waver. It also has a positive message about life, without ramming it down your throat, which only adds to it's charm. This isn't an all action film and is very much story driven and some may disappointed by that. But as long as you are aware that this a long film, that requires some concentration, then you will be in for a treat and a spellbinding fairytale. Well worth a viewing and it should put those Brad Pitt doubters in their place too.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
142311339X|4.0|Being a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series that Riordan so masterfully engineered, I was extremely excited to learn that he was creating a spin-off to the tale he had previously woven of a boy haunted by figures in Greek mythology. Setting the scene once again at Camp Half-Blood, the only safe place for kids who have a god for a parent, Riordan introduces some new characters to Percy Jackson's universe. The catch? One of those kids, a boy named Jason, seems to be more associated with the Roman counterpart to the mythological world. He brings his friend Leo and his sort-of girlfriend Piper to the camp with him. The strange thing is, Jason doesn't remember anything- and it's all Hera's fault, once again. The three go on a journey with their protector, a satyr named Gleeson Hedge, to save Hera, who has been captured by an evil race of giants. The world is being taken over yet again, and this time, the antagonist is ten times worse than some old TItan.     Generally, sequels or spin-offs are never as good as their original story. Fortunately, Riordan stuck with what he knows he is good at while at the same time, he manages to bring in a whole new cast of funny and entertaining characters. While his story might get confusing at times, his writing is as witty as ever. He even manages to practically eliminate pangs for the old Percy Jackson stories while bringing a desire from the readers to learn more about the evil giants and the answers to the questions of the origins of Jason. (On a side-note, as a subplot, Percy Jackson has gone missing and is being searched for by his girlfriend, Annabeth.) Read this book after finishing the Percy Jackson series- I promise, it will not disappoint.
B001FB55I0|3.0|I'm guessing this is a contentious films for die-hard fans of the Terminator series and you'll either like it or loathe it. O.K., I'll admit from the start I am fan of the Terminator franchise and although I went to see this with some trepidation after T3, I have to say I came away pleasantly surprised. As a stand alone film (which may the best way to look at it) this is pretty good and as part of the overall series it develops the story well and has something to add to the previous films. It will never be as good as the first two films, but I'm glad to say it's better than T3. Bale is good as John Connor, if a little wooden at times, but the real surprise was Sam Worthington who has the best role in the film. The CGI effects are good, but not overbearing and McG's direction was ok, but a little too jerky for my tastes. You do get some cheesy lines in this film and plenty of nods to the previous films, but nothing too excessive and most produce a wry smile rather than outright groans. The main problem with this film is that you don't care about the characters that much. In the first films you wanted to know what happened next and considered the lives of the main characters, but in this film they are just faces on a screen delivering lines. It's sad but true and the main downfall of this film. If you go expecting your typical Hollywood action movie you'll be fine, just don't expect anything of great substance or anything as good as the first two films and you won't be disappointed. 3.5 stars<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0307272702|5.0|The other positive reviews say what I want to say in that this book is a must-read for all people who can read ...   .. But I have a few wishes for Mr Taubes for a follow up:    1) The US food labeling laws allow for a per-serving calculation of protein/fat/carbs.  It's all in metric grams \\"servings\\" of course. The trouble is a serving could be quite small.  In Europe they have a second column for 100g of the product.  Why is this important?  In the US a manufacturer is allowed to set a figure to zero if it is less that 1g.  You can see this if you compare non-light mayonnaise jars in the supermarket.  They are all zero carbs per portion yet many have sugar in them.  It is because manufacturers take the formulations to the 1g limit where they can.  If there were a 100g column as well, producers would not be able to employ the 'less than 1g' trick without that being obvious in the adjacent column.  The only good mayonnaise in the United States is [[ASIN:B0007MUM6S The Ojai Cook Lemonaise 12 oz. jar]] for that reason, and that claim is only deducible by looking at the list of ingredients.    2) How are expected to source raw ingredients that have the right fat levels.  US butchers trim off the fat before meat gets put on the display.  Where's the network of producers who will cooperate?  Where's the support forum?  Where's the equivalent of the \\"Organic\\" certification ? Where's the (shorter) education program for vendors?    3) Lard's effect on HDL, LDL (etc) was explored.  What about the equivalent for other other fat/oil types. It does not seem right to just vaguely direct people to a government website.
B000001G16|4.0|`Stranger in this Town' is Sambora's first solo album and although it's not quite as good or polished as `Undiscovered Soul' it still sounds amazing and shows his talent away from Bon Jovi. `Church of Desire' and `Stranger in this Town' are both strong offerings here and `Mr Bluesman' has a guest appearance from Eric Clapton and this album leads perfectly to the album closer `The Answer' which is a gentle way to end an album that offers rock, blues and more introspective tracks. This shows Sambora's individual song writing abilities and you realise his voice is as good as Jon Bon Jovi's, in fact by the second solo album I'd say it is better! His guitar playing also shines through and you quickly realise how underrated he is and how much his talents are hidden as a part of Bon Jovi. I love this album even after all these years and although a little rough around the edges, it still makes for great listening. Give it a try and you may be surprised to hear what Sambora has to offer, just make sure you check out `Undiscovered Soul' as well and then, like me, pray for another solo album soon.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1600108512|5.0|Peter Beagle's \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is one of the ultimate modern fairy tales: the magical, bittersweet story of a little unicorn's search for others of her kind. And the graphic novel adaptation does justice to Beagle's story -- the story is only enhanced by the exquisitely lovely art, full of soft colors and elusive magic.<br /><br />A unicorn has lived happily in her idyllic little forest, until the day she hears a man say that \\"unicorns are long gone -- if indeed they ever were.\\" To find if she is indeed the last unicorn, she sets out on a journey across the land, and soon discovers that the people have forgotten what a unicorn even looks like.<br /><br />But she hears a butterfly speak of the Red Bull, and how he has captured all the unicorns of the world except her.<br /><br />Along her journey, she is captured by a traveling circus, and rescued by a bumbling young wizard with illusion powers. Along with the wizard and a bandit's girlfriend, she makes her way to the malignant castle of King Haggard -- and is transformed into a mortal girl, who experiences love, uncertainty, and finally sorrow.<br /><br />\\"The Last Unicorn\\" is honestly one of my favorite fantasy novels of all time, especially since Peter Beagle managed to write such a simple, haunting little fairy tale. There's romance, tragedy, fantastical creatures, and a mythical creature setting out on a seemingly hopeless quest.<br /><br />And the graphic novel adaptation of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is an absolutely exquisite in every way. It's obvious that the team behind it had great love for Beagle's novel, and they preserve the beauty of his prose (\\"Your eyes are full of green leaves, crowded with trees and streams and small animals\\") whenever possible.<br /><br />And Renae de Liz's artwork translates Beagle's writing into ethereal, magical visuals; her work reminds me of Charles de Lint. She presents us with the soft, luminous forest the unicorn comes from, glowing light, twilit skies, tangled trees and quaint little villages. And she handles the ugly as well as the lovely -- she conveys the grey deadness of Haggard's castle and hellish fire of the Red Bull as easily as Amalthea's ethereal loveliness.<br /><br />The graphic novel adaptation of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is a haunting, shimmering experience that translates Peter Beagle's classic novel into exquisite art.s well as the lovely -- she conveys the grey deadness of Haggard's castle and hellish fire of the Red Bull as easily as Amalthea's ethereal loveliness.

B001GMH8SI|5.0|'Into The Wild' is a very gentle, introspective film that had me engrossed the whole way through. Emile Hirsch's performance draws you immediately into his characters (Chris') pursuit of a free, unfettered life, in touch with nature and it's finer elements. You understand his idealism and his strong focus to achieve his aims. Sean Penn directed this film superbly. One part that stands out is when Chris goes into a big city and his feelings of disconnect and alienation. Penn manages to show these emotions (using various film and camera techniques) with real skill and you feel as awkward and out of place as Chris does. The soundtrack is awesome, with music by Eddie Vedder and it really adds to the overall feel of the film. You can really see the benefits of this type of lifestyle and a part of you yearns to follow the life Chris did and to experience life, relationships and nature on a fundamental, stripped back level. Having read the book I was aware of the general story and this film is remarkably faithful to it, there are very few deviations. In addition, I felt none of the frustrations with Chris' attitude that I felt when reading the book. Being portrayed on the screen and acted so well, I understood the mindset a little more. He is shown to be more naive in the book than in the film, but this made the film a better viewing experience, they are different media after all. This film offers some insightful ideas and philosophy, but you aren't spoon fed them or have them rammed down your throat, which is a refreshing change from a Hollywood film. With amazing locations, excellent acting, top direction and an inspired soundtrack this makes for one great film and one I highly recommend.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0887431461|4.0|I looked at this book in a local store, and loved the variety of activities, and skill level that it contained (good for my preschooler).  There were enough pages of each skill to teach and then practice.    I ordered this from Amazon's marketplace.  When I received the book, it looked completely different and even had different pages inside.  Thinking that I got the wrong book from the seller, I double checked the ISBN, and it was the same.  So, apparently when they updated the book (with the current pic shown on this site), they didn't change the ISBN.  The new version is MUCH better; the older one has a lot of useless, boring skill sheets.  If I had known this, I'd just have bought straight from Amazon.  So, anyway, please be aware that you might not get the exact book you think you are getting, through no fault of the sellers on here (the did match the ISBN).
B000654YRY|5.0|I have spent many a happy hour watching this dvd with my best friend and even now, after repeated viewings, I'm still left in awe at the musicianship on offer. From the concert opener `Calling Elvis' with that constant underlying pedal steel riff and tongue in cheek quacking percussion (you'll know what I mean when you hear it) to the awesome `Heavy Fuel' and `On Every Street' with more amazing pedal steel from Paul Franklin, this concert has a great selection of tracks from the `On Every Street' album. It also has some firm favourites like `Walk of Life', `Romeo and Juliet', `Private Investigation', `Money for Nothing' and `Brothers in Arms' to round of the track selection in style. Knopflers guitar playing is as tight and inspiring as ever and the tone he manages to wring out of his Pensa Suhr guitars is nothing but breath taking. The audience are obviously enjoying themselves, as are all the musicians and this makes for great viewing experience, really putting you in the moment with the crowd. For a slice of live Dire Straits this really can't be beaten and it is still a favourite live dvd of mine all these years later. Simply incredible.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1572816295|5.0|in that it is Tim Burton in pastel with a touch of \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" effect - published before Tim released the movie. The characters have a whimsical look but seem to be carrying a secret - which is in the eye of the reader. I am not sure if the artist had this in mind when creating this deck, but I love the concept. I was very impressed - I collect and was happy to have this lovely deck aboard!!!!
B001AQO400|5.0|There aren't many films on Amazon that can generate as many reviews as this one has received and this alone should tip you off to the unique nature of `Lost in Translation'. I won't add another synopsis here when other reviewers have done it so well before and Amazon explain the general premise in their product description. I agree with other reviewers who state that the beauty in this film derives from the smallest touch or glance between Charlotte and Bob rather than from an in-depth, convoluted plot line. Or it comes from the music (by Kevin Shields) that perfectly compliments the feelings of separation from the characters own lives and from the city they are exploring together, or from the fact that Coppola manages to deliver a film that is both poignant and entertaining without ramming any messages down your throat like most Hollywood films are inclined to do. I tend to feel Bill Murray has rarely acted better than in this film and saying that, the same applies to Scarlett Johannsson, both play their roles superbly with just the right amount of humour and seriousness to lend it credibility. The film feels more ethereal and unreal as it progresses due to the characters prolonged jet lag and insomnia and their intense personal connection amidst the confusion of Tokyo and it is this element that I'm sure loses and gains it many fans. It is also infused with that sense of delicious melancholy you can sometimes feel, without making you feel sad or low. Bob and Charlotte's friendship quickly develops until, in a seeming contradiction, it is very much a romantic plutonic relationship and it is this aspect of the film that sustains it when it could feel too slow or spaced out, as it keeps your interest engaged. If you come to this film expecting a Hollywood all action blockbuster you will disappointed, but if you come to this expecting a unique and brief snapshot of two peoples lives as they spend time together learning about themselves and each other, then you should enjoy this to the full and see what all the hype is about. You'll either love it or hate it but I guess it's one to watch and make your own mind up about either way.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.enjoy this to the full and see what all the hype is about.

0765326353|4.0|The Book shipped on time.  I gave the book a shot because I like the work Sanderson has done on The Wheel of Time series.  Lots of character development and a little slow in spots but hey ut's the first book in the series so what do you expect.
B000EZ7ZYA|4.0|`Hitch' is an above average romantic comedy which has some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments and plenty of Will Smiths charm and humour. Smiths character, Hitch, is a dating consultant who, whilst easing the path of many geeky men in their own lovelives, has trouble wooing the lady he is interested in himself. This makes for many funny scenes where he coaches his clients to be suave and sophisticated on the one hand and then watching him royally mess things up on the other. The scene where Hitch has an allergic reaction to shellfish is especially funny and Smith carries it off with style. This isn't an amazing Hollywood blockbuster, or trying to be some deep meaningful art piece, it is a simple fun romantic comedy and as that is all it's trying to achieve, it carries it off well. Worth a look on a lazy Sunday afternoon or to rent on a quiet date night in.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0036OS3EM|5.0|Absolutely love them! I wear size 6,5 and ordered 7 and they fit perfectly. I can walk the whole day wearing them and they stay warm, comfortable and dry (even if I after heavy snow). I've got compliments how cute they are and also didn't hesitate to advice them to my friends.
B001H5X7KC|3.0|`Tropic Thunder' was directed by, co-written by and starred Ben Stiller and makes for a fairly amusing couple of hours viewing. From the spoof adverts and film trailers at the start of this film you know what you're letting yourself in for and the film continues in much the same vein. This is a spoof Vietnam film about the filming of a Vietnam film and it borrows very heavily from Platoon, as well as other famous Vietnam films to a lesser extent. If you know your Vietnam war films you can play spot the scene relatively easily. This didn't have me belly rolling in laughter, but it did have some funny moments that raise a laugh and it is fairly easy going and humorous. The cast is pretty great, with many famous faces, not least Tom Cruise as a funny film exec and Nick Nolte as a Vietnam Veteran, but the one who stole the film for me had to be Robert Downey Junior who had me laughing at nearly every line he delivered, he was very funny and this film would've been a lot duller without him. The direction was good and the pyrotechnics were pretty impressive too. If you've seen other Ben Stiller films you'll know what to expect, this has plenty of his off the wall comedy, slightly crass jokes and lots of furrowed brows and pouting. For an afternoons easy viewing this is pretty decent, nothing ground breaking or amazing, but a good enough comedy to pass the time.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0034G4OWM|4.0|Silly? yes. However, my kids LOVED this movie. They have watched it over and over and still laugh out loud at the animals and the tricks they play.
B000WQWPJQ|4.0|It's surprising just how good `Cast Away' is. I mean, who would've thought a film about a man alone on a desert island would be so riveting? Maybe that is testament to Tom Hanks who turns out a star performance here. The location and scenery are also amazing and the direction shows it off to excellent effect. This film follows Chuck Noland (Hanks) as he survives a plane crash and has to live on a deserted island in the middle of the pacific ocean for four years. You live his loneliness and trials as he struggles to survive and learn the skill necessary to get by. In fact the scene when he finally learns to make fire, and his reaction to it, never fails to raise a smile and you truly feel his jubilation. The middle section of the film on the island is very quiet, as previously noted in other reviews, but it doesn't drag and only heightens the isolation Noland must feel. Hanks keeps you engrossed by his every nuance and movement he makes. It's only when Noland begins to unwrap FedEx parcels (from the plane crash) and finds a Wilson Volley ball, that he paints a face onto, does he start talking again. It actually become quite touching to see him interact with an inanimate object and must be one of the most unique on-screen relationships ever! The ending is a little `Hollywood' and cheesy, but not excessively so and I'll admit to a lump in my throat briefly towards the end. This is a simple premise, excellently executed and although I've seen this film many times it never gets boring or any less gripping. Well worth a watch.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Stephen King is,and always has been,my hero! I love his work--I wish I had only one ounce of his imagination. This version of THE SHINING is still,IMO,the best. I heard that Mr.King was not happy with some of the scenes but,I think the television re-make that he did support was nothing compared to the original film. It stands up today, 25 years later. Scary is scary...especially SK scary. Loved the book,too,of course! Many of his books just don't translate to film,but I highly recommend THE SHINING.  It's kind of perfect--right up there with THE DEAD ZONE (my favorite SK-based film).
B000929AJQ|4.0|A long time coming, `With Teeth' showed those doubters that Nine Inch Nails not only still had `it' but could actually improve as well. With a slightly more brooding feel this album takes a few listens to get a feel for it, but once you do you realise it has plenty to offer. With Dave Grohl guesting on some tracks you get some thumping percussion, but this album isn't without nuance, as `Right Where it Belongs' demonstrates. In fact this may be my favourite track on the album. You get two version of this track as well, as there are two bonus tracks at the end. There isn't any booklet or album information with this CD and the packaging is as sparse and pared back as the music, but if you go to the website you can find out all the info you may require. This is the first NIN album I tried and I was wholly impressed and quickly went and found some others and although all the albums have a similar feel to them (as you would want with a band you enjoy) this one seems more focused and sits together well as an overall album. Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004BLTNJI|5.0|I am only commenting on the 3D aspect of it....not the story itself.     I have several movies in 3d and for me this is bright & colorful. Story is well done but unfortunately nothing really leaps out of the screen at you except for a few instances. I did not think that I was going to like this but watching this in 3D really changed my mind.    I did not really care for Alice in Wonderland or A Christmas Carol. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Despicable Me are pretty good but this I found to be more of a visual treat.    I must say that out of all that I have -Saw 3D and Clash of the Titans-Resident Evil... just do not hold up against CGI movies. IMAX does great stuff but those are not movies.    From start to finish Coraline is a visual feast and I would recommend this for anyone that has a 3D television.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|One of the stand-out elements to `Into the Wild' was the soundtrack and I'm glad to say this album more than lives up to my memories of the music on offer. Eddie Vedder manages to write and perform some great tracks that compliment the film perfectly and are credible songs in their own right. `Hard Sun' is probably the strongest song on the album (and ironically one of the two not written by Vedder) and I love it so much I often skip back to the start and listen again when it's finished. I also love `The Wolf' which sounds primal and raw and it lingers in your head long after you've finished listening. The music on offer is acoustic and ever so slightly folky and although some may describe it as melancholy, I find it always stirs my spirit and connects me back to the themes of the film (and book). If you enjoyed the film it's a safe bet you'll enjoy this CD, ditto if you're a fan of Eddie Vedder's more acoustic work and the real bonus is that you can still enjoy it if you don't come under either of the above categories as well. Sit back, chill out and enjoy.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00004TJWE|5.0|It is a tragedy that this album has been lost to time. Sf Sorrow is an album that preceded both The Wall and Tommy, and yet shows the same themes of isolation and spiritual exploration. This album, probably the first concept album if you don't count Sgt. Pepper, combines the explosive psychedelia of the day with a deep and interesting story. The sorrowful \\"Bracelets of Fingers\\" and \\"Trust\\" are thoughtful songs that show the sad overtone of the album, while others like \\"Baron Saturday\\" and \\"She Says Good Morning\\" are rocking psychedelic masterpieces, full of the unusual characters, distorted voices, and bizarre instrumentation that made this decade so unique. Sf Sorrow is an incredible album. If you like Rock, if you like Psychedelia, if you like concept albums, or if you just want a new album to check out, I can recommend no better album than Sf Sorrow.
B000002P5R|5.0|`First Rays of the New Rising Sun' is apparently the album Jimi was working on before his death and features songs that later appeared on `Cry of Love', `Rainbow Bridge' and `War Heroes'. To be honest I preferred the track listings on those albums to this selection, but that may just be because I heard them first! Saying that, the music on offer here is outstanding and Jimi's prodigious talents shine through full force. From energetic tracks like `Freedom' or `Izabella', to the more poppy `Dolly Dagger' which is completely infectious, via the blues of `Hey Baby (New Rising Sun) before ending on the delightful and lighthearted blues lullaby `Belly Button Window' this album offers it all. As always with these Experience Hendrix releases there are comprehensive liner notes, photos and an essay to enjoy as you sit back and let this music wash over you. I grew up on Hendrix and although I'm hearing this music once again, but in a different order that I'm used to, that in no way detracts from the power of the music and musicianship on offer. Another excellent Hendrix release and one well worth adding to your collection.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003L20ICE|4.0|I honestly had no idea what The Kids Are All Right was about based on the few trailers I'd seen of it, but it looked good enough to want to watch it.  And I love Julianne Moore no matter what she's in.  Then, when it got nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor I knew I wanted to see it no matter what.<br /><br />It's the story of a lesbian couple, Nic and Jules, played by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore who have two kids - Joni and Laser.  They are a close family.  Joni is 18 and this is her last summer at home before college.  Laser is 15 and enjoys sports and hanging out with his best friend.  Nic and Jules are still in love with each other and seem to have the perfect marriage and family until the kids locate the man who was their sperm donor.  He's a cool grungy guy named Paul, played by Mark Ruffalo, who runs a restaurant and an organic community garden.<br /><br />The kids like Paul and want to connect and hang out with him.  There are several awkward moments, as there should be, as they search for things to talk about and Paul honestly tries to learn about who \\"his\\" kids are.  Nic, the dominant one of the two Moms, decides they should have Paul over and meet him too.  But it's the chemistry between Paul and Jules that is about to turn everything upside down.<br /><br />The awkwardness between characters in different scenes presents itself as some perfect laugh out loud comedy.  Nic and Jules have a romantic moment alone in their bedroom and watch gay man porn for stimulation.  Later, the Moms catch Laser and his friend watching their DVD and try to get their son to talk to them about it if he's gay, although he isn't.<br /><br />This is a stellar cast.  I loved Josh Hutcherson as Laser.  He has some excellent scenes that show a lot of heart and emotion, such as playing basketball with Paul and asking if he'd rather be buried or cremated, and Paul asks him if he prefers Nike or New Balance.  Paul shuns his \\"cool\\" friend Clay for wanting to urinate on a stray dog that wanders by, then the two trade punches in the face.  Joni, played by Mia Wasikowska,  also has her classic moments too - picking vegetables with Paul and getting a ride home from him on his motorcycle, even though her moms hate motorcycles, or playing scrabble with her \\"boy\\" friend while her sex crazed girl friend drools over jocks in the yearbook.<br /><br />The only problem the movie has is its lack of intensity when the conflict is finally out in the open.  We build to it with intensity, but then are let down a bit by the outcome. Each character quickly deals with it in their own way, and then the movie is just pushed forward to its obvious heartfelt end.  But overall, I still loved the movie.  I was totally caught off guard by it, and that made me appreciate it even more.  Too bad Moore missed a nomination, but the other awards are much deserved!that wanders by, then the two trade punches in the face.

B001VZY4M8|5.0|`After the Gold Rush' is one of those seminal albums and required listening for fans of Neil Young, both existing and new. This is the album that really kicked off his solo career and it has some great songs on it. Neil Young sings in his usual plaintive style and his vocals suit the themes of the songs perfectly. I love `Southern Man' which was his indictment of deep south bigotry and it has some excellent guitar towards the end. `Don't Let It Bring You Down' is another standout track as well. Written before his super successful `Harvest' album, this album shows where Neil Young's style was heading and these two album compliment each other superbly. To go back to Neil Young's roots this is a great place to start, it has plenty of his early folk style playing and engaging lyrics as well, that I enjoy reading along with the songs for the poetry they create. Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B001PPLJIQ|4.0|`The Reader' is the film that finally won Winslett her Oscar and it has to be said that her performance in this film is very worthy. Saying that, all of the performance's from all involved are very strong and the direction is superb as well. The Amazon synopsis explains the story very well, as do other reviews here, but suffice to say this is a richly woven story with an interesting analysis of human nature. Most WW2 or holocaust films can be particularly harrowing and although this is also the case with this film (but only in places) the emphasis is most definitely on the human relationships involved rather than graphic details of cruelty. The relationship between the young Michael and Hanna is intriguing to watch, with an unusual dynamic that is explained as the film develops and you begin to understand why she enjoys being read to so much. The relationship between them when Michael is an adult is more complex and conducted from afar and both these aspects of their relationship are portrayed extremely well. This is quite slow going in places but is worth persevering with and this makes for a couple of hours good viewing and engrossing drama. Well worth a try and worth the plaudits it has received.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0000009SY|5.0|Everything about this concept piece is amazing. The story is well done with tongue-in-cheek (and/or blatant) humor all the way. The music is just as you would expect from Zappa. Really really advanced and well-written. The one note that I have is that some of the songs run a little long. This isn't a problem when you are really immersed in the album, but just listening to \\"Keep It Greasy\\" or something can be a little tiring. I suggest you listen to the album in one go, so you can get the full Joe's Garage experience. Highlights include \\"Joe's Garage\\", \\"Catholic Girls\\", \\"Packard Goose\\", \\"Watermelon in Easter Hay\\" and the irrelevant grand finale \\"A Little Green Rosetta\\". Especially recommended for musicians.
B00000I07Q|4.0|Written in Bon Jovi's `big hair rock' era `New Jersey' has some good tracks on it, as well as a few more dubious selections. `Bad Medicine' is probably the most well known and the track that delighted stadium fans around the world and `Lay Your Hands On Me' is in a similar crowd pleasing vein. This was when Jon on Jovi was in his cowboy influenced phase (written around the same time as his solo 'Blaze Of Glory' Soundtrack album) and that shows though clearly on tracks such as `Ride Cowboy Ride' and `Stick To Your Guns' and although these are ok, these are the weaker tracks on the album and feel like 'Blaze Of Glory' rejects! It has been said on previous reviews that this is the album Jon Bon Jovi tried to show his Springsteen roots/influence the most clearly and on tracks such as `Blood on Blood' you can see he tries to emulate Springsteen's songwriting ability and song themes, but sadly never comes close, although I enjoy this song for what it is. For easy going, fun rock music, this album is a pretty good place to go. Although Bon Jovi have produced better albums that achieve the same goal both before and since (`Slippery When Wet' and `Keep The Faith`) and I put this one on once I`ve played those first and suggest you consider doing the same.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000NIVJEU|3.0|Having not read the books I came to this film with an open mind and although it's not amazing, it is a pretty decent medieval type fantasy adventure. Following Eragon as he acquires a Dragon egg and subsequently learns to be a Dragon Rider, this film has plenty of CGI animation and sword fights. Eragon has to fight to rid the lands of an evil king and his tyrannical rule and battles against a shade (or wizard to you and me) in the form of Robert Carlyle. All in all this is pretty standard fantasy film fare, with nothing highly original or earthshaking. The effects are good and the story, although lack lustre, manages to keep you watching. I'm inclined to feel if it was much longer I'd be getting bored though. The cast is sadly underused and Jeremy Irons and Malkovich could deliver so much more. If you like fantasy type films then you'll probably enjoy this, even if you've enjoyed better examples of the genre in the past and if you don't watch many then this will still provide a couple hours of light entertainment where you don't have to think too hard. From reading other reviews you may enjoy this more if you haven't read the books! Good but not great.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B0041KKYEW|4.0|BLACK SWAN<br /><br />STARRING: Natalie Portman, Milla Kunis, Vincent Castle, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John J. McLaughlin<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Darren Aronofsky<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Drama / Thriller<br />Release Date: 17 December 2011<br />Review Date: 14 January 2011<br /><br />Black Swan was a good movie, but it wasn't as great as everyone's making it out to be and it certainly wasn't filled with all the risqu&eacute; sex you've been hearing about. I'll go on record saying - there is no sex in the movie at all.  There are some pretty steamy close calls and a very erotic moment of Natalie Portman alone in her bedroom - but no sex. What a bummer.<br /><br />I only mention this because the movie is oozing with sex appeal and it is drenched with the anticipation of sex to come, without the payoff. This is something that the film forced me to expect Portman's character to embellish in. Luckily it makes up for this with an Oscar worthy performance by Portman (for which I'm sure she'll win), and an equally amazing directorial consummation by Darren Aronofsky who also brought us 2008's The Wrestler.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I refuse to jump on the band wagon of those who claim Milla Kunis is warranted a nod as well; my gut tells me the bitchy role comes pretty natural to her, and if I'm wrong, it's nothing we haven't already seen her do once or twice.<br /><br />So I'll continue by stating that Portman stars as our lead character Nina and Kunis is her costar, Lilly. Nina is the nice girl; Lilly, the bitch. They both are interested in the same lead role in a ballet play called Black Swan. When Nina wins the role over Lilly and everyone else, there is some hostility to say the least.<br /><br />Nina is very grateful to be given a shot as prestigious as this, and she shows this to us in an instant flood of tears in a private bathroom stall. Lilly matches Nina's gratefulness, with endless looks of cold jealousy, to which Nina seems to not know what to do with, nor does she really sense the girl that Lilly really is, when they begin to hang out together.<br /><br />This is what draws us in to Portman's portrayal of Nina. She's shy, timid, probably a virgin, and we get the sense that she's uncomfortable in her own skin. So much in fact, that she often picks at it, to the point of drawing blood. She lives with her mother (Barbara Hershey) who is smothering and controlling nearly to the extent of a villain in any number of Disney classic evil step mothers.<br /><br />Everything in Nina's world evolves around her work as a ballet dancer. Her mother is infatuated with the details of her long days in rehearsals, as she gave up a similar dream years ago, to take care of Nina. For that there is some bitter resentment.<br /><br />Nina is a grown woman, but her mother does not like the idea of locked doors, and we get the notion that she cleans Nina's room for her too, which is overly stocked with stuffed animals and child like trinkets. There has been no sex in this room, and there shant ever be. So you can imagine the shock of Nina's mother when she brings someone home with her after a night of drinking, and jerry-rigs the door shut.<br /><br />Nina has done this because she is becoming invested in her character to the point of mad obsession. The play calls for Nina to begin the first act as a `white swan' who is an innocent, to which she will transform into a `black swan' who is evil, and then kill herself when her lover has betrayed her for another woman.<br /><br />This movie is very bizarre and I liked it; particularly trying to figure out just what the hell was going on. It's twisted and dark and will only continue to gain more popularity as the word of so spreads.<br /><br />Credit is due to Darren Aronofsky, because now that I think about it, I'm never a fan of the subject matter in any of his films: professional wrestling in The Wrestler, drug addiction in Requiemfor a Dream, and ballet dancing here; but yet I found all three films entertaining to include their subject matter.matter.
1416583408|1.0|I had high hopes for this book.  The title promises so much but the book does not deliver.    I love dogs, I have one of my own and I was really looking forwards to   learning more; substantially more about dogs.    This book seems to touch on and gloss over many, many different aspects of dogs but   the reader is left with no real information or insight in the end.    I don't know what the point of this book is.  It is not the results of a lot of research.  It is definitely not definitive.  It really does not offer any persuasive insight into the mind of a dog.    It is mainly a jumble of well known and lessor known facts, a huge amount of conjecture and many rather trite anecdotes about the author's own dog presented in a rather smug and knowing fashion.    Definitely avoid giving this book as a gift to a dog lover.  They will be certainly be disappointed.  I suggest you try to find something written by someone who actually has a lot of firsthand experience working with many different dogs.
B003HFFVDQ|4.0|Tom and Ed's berevity is a winner here - only eight tracks and all the vocals by Tom.  Much better that the last release and a beautiful primer for their forthcomming tour Downunder which I am very much looking forward to.  I have been listening to these lads for a long time now and have never seen them live.  Big ups.  Favorite track is the cut-up bass wobble of Another World.
B00065EB2M|5.0|I will make this short and sweet, if your a fan of the Apollo program or just the US Space program in general then this is a must buy. In fact, I highly recommend all of the documentaries from Spacecraft films. They are easily the best documentaries ever released on the US Space program. None of the other titles in existence even come close to matching what Spacecraft films gives you. These documentaries are extensive and usually contain most, if not all, of the video content known to exist for these missions. These guys try and find as much content as they can and ultimately this includes footage from NASA centers, the National Archives, Military archive repositories and even private collections. On top of that Spacecraft Films actually restores much of the footage so even if you have seen some of the footage before, you haven't seen it look this good.<br /><br />This particular release is obviously focused on Apollo 17, the final Apollo Mission and believe me when I tell you its all here.<br /><br />Disc 1 focuses on the mission training and the launch of Apollo 17. This title is extremely unique in regards to the launch as it was the only Saturn V launch to take place at night.<br /><br />Disc 2 focuses on the landing and roughly the first half of EVA 1<br /><br />Disc 3 focuses on the 2nd half of EVA 1 and the first half of EVA 2<br /><br />Disc 4 focuses on the 2nd half of EVA 2 and the beginning of EVA 3<br /><br />Disc 5 focuses on the rest of EVA 3 including the liftoff from the moon.<br /><br />Disc 6 is basically the return home including the mission recovery footage.<br /><br />Apollo 17 was not only the last Apollo mission, it was also the longest Apollo mission lasting a total of 13 days.<br /><br />I will openly admit that these documentaries are not for everyone. Much of the footage is shown in its entirety and lets face it, people who are not hard core space enthusiasts will not find long periods of footage entertaining. For the MTV and special effects generation, a lot of this content will seem utterly boring. That's just the nature of the beast as a lot of what the astronauts had to go through will again seem boring to people with only a modest interest in the space program. They dont have orgies in the command module, this isn't Die Hard V in space, and it isn't a highly edited 30 minute NASA documentary on the Discovery channel. Some of these releases, like Apollo 17, have 6 DVD's in content. That is A LOT of content so to go in expecting that its all going to be exciting footage is just a huge mistake. With that being said, people who have a deep fascination with the space program and how it works will find these sets hugely educational and extremely entertaining. In other words if you dont consider yourself a hardcore space fanatic then your probably better off sticking with National Geographic, The Discovery Channel or BBC. These sets are designed for space enthusiasts who want to see everything or at least want the option to see everything.<br /><br />The bottom line - If you consider yourself a huge fan of the space program then this purchase should be a no-brainer. This set does a remarkable job at detailing the entire Apollo 17 mission from start to finish. Spacecraft Films just gets better and better with each new release and this was imo one of their best sets yet. With that being said, if your expecting documentaries like you see on The Discovery Channel or National Geographic then you will probably find this set disappointing. Those documentaries take the most exciting footage and edit it into a 30-45 minute documentary and you will get none of that here. This is Apollo 17 in its entirety. Again definitely a set for the die hard space enthusiasts.<br /><br />5 Stars and then some!!'s just the nature of the beast as a lot of what the astronauts had to go through will again seem boring to people with only a modest interest in the space program.

B001IAOEXU|2.0|I like them, when they stay on... But when the action is getting intense, I tend to pull harder on the triggers, and they pop off.  So I've stopped using them altogether.  Maybe it's my fault for pulling too hard on them.  But... they're just not going to work out for me.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|As a long time natalie merchant fan, this album blew me away. also, it is one of the few out there that it is worth buying for real instead of the mp3's. the cd is a work of art, with all the poems laid out in their original format with author bios. i actually got this gift twice for christmas and im going to give one as a present!
B002PDBA90|5.0|Steve Wilson is a brilliant musical genious IMO.  Everything he's involved in is pure musical bliss.  I own everything he's ever done which includes all the Porcupine Tree albums and DVD's, his solo album \\"Insurgentes\\" and his albums with Blackfield.  Voyage 34 is simply put Steve Wilson at his very best!!!  Put on a good pair of headphones, eat some shrooms, and enjoy the voyage :-)
0743297334|4.0|'Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises' is the first Hemingway book I read many years ago and is one i've recently re-read. Partly autobiographical and based on his time in Paris, this book showcases Hemingways style perfectly. Short, well crafted sentences that portray the full feeling in any given scene without you realising how deeply you are being affected. You get a sense of feeling of the characters without truly knowing them, which is kind of true of life and a unique talent Hemingway shares. The book builds in tension as the group of friends move to Pamplona for the fiesta and bull running until it reaches it's climax. The end is in no way earth shattering, but a true example of human nature and the mistakes that we make that plague us so. I tend to feel that there are other Hemingway books to try first (Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls) but as the first book of his I read, this has a special place in my heart and is definitely well worth a read to immerse yourself in the style and book that truly made him famous. If you enjoy this then try 'A Moveable Feast' which is the memoirs of his time in Paris and a wonderful read.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|As far as the movie itself goes it is one of my favorites. I liked it before Zombieland but now I love it. I am not sure the movie really benefits from the Blu-Ray format though.
B00168OINK|3.0|'Kung Fun Panda' is your basic fun, family computer animated movie. It has lots of silly jokes, cute characters and a simple, yet humorous storyline. It follows Po the panda as he gets trained to be the dragon warrior and how he is treated by the other kung fun pupils. There is a high 'star' voice-over list for this film, including Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan and they all do a great job bringing life to their various characters. It seems strange to ask Jackie Chan to do a voice over as he is a very physical actor and was barely used in this film, but it lends the film some martial arts kudos I guess. This is a good film for kids and is fun enough to keep parents interested as well. At just under 90 minutes it's not too long so kids will lose their attention or parents will get bored. It does what it sets out to do well, be a fun animated adventure, but there are better animated films out there and this has a great deal to live up to (hence the 3 stars). Worth a look, but not one to rush out to buy the first time you hear of it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00097DX3U|5.0|`Out of Exile' is a pretty solid follow up album to Audioslaves' storming debut and is one that gets better with repeated listening. It has a slightly more down beat feel to it, but in no way does that mean there aren't great tracks on here to delight old fans and capture some new. The stand out track for me has to be `Be Yourself' with a slightly melancholy feeling at the start and yet it still manages to leave me feeling positive by the end. You also get a live bonus track of `Like A Stone' which is a great way to end this album. Produced by Rick Rubin you know you're on safe ground and the band and producer more than deliver here. If you already like Audioslave then it's a safe bet you'll like this album as well and if you're new to the band i'd suggest you buy their debut album first and then give this a whirl, whichever way you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000OVLBF8|4.0|Much better than I had expected... but are these casting people so stupid they didn't notice Eva Mendez is Afro-Cuban, while the actress playing her younger version is a Caucasian Latina?? Are they that stupid?
B001HUHBAE|4.0|'Zodiac' is a good film that kept me interested for the whole duration, but with a slightly lack lustre ending. I know this is based on real events so the director was unable to spice the ending up too much, but I found the way it fizzled out and wrapped up the story with a few screens worth of writing at the end pretty poor pay off for well over 2 1/2 hours viewing. Saying that, this film is very atmospheric. It is excellently directed and the various actors do a top job in building suspense and keeping you hooked into the story. Some murder scenes early on are quite shocking and powerful without being excessively gratuitous, which is something in itself. Overall this is a good film, that should keep you watching, but don't expect too many plot twists or a shock ending to leave you with that feeling of satisfaction. A solid four stars.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003S6T5U4|3.0|5 stars for the original album - 3 stars for this remastered version.    HTH has always been my favorite Jayhawks album bar none. Great songwriting and playing on every track.    I had always hoped that one day if this album gets the re-release treatment we would see a 2 disc deluxe version.    Something like TTGG received - I liked TTGG it was def great too - tho it was more produced sounding (and that was planned by the band and Drakoulias) - TTGG was at the #2 spot behind HTH (for me).    So with that said - I was hoping for a deluxe 2 cd version of HTH - a version with an expanded booklet with pictures from the sessions - demos, or maybe a DVD of a live concert from this HTH era.    I'm grateful that the original album was remastered and expanded but was hoping and thought this album deserved a 2 disc deluxe version.
B000002KBU|5.0|First of all let me start off by saying 'Blue' is a truly beautiful album. The blend of Joni's voice and songwriting weave a spell of such wonder that you can physically feel yourself relax into this album as you listen to it. It is starkly open and honest and she manages to draw you into each song almost instantaneously. This album has become a classic and for good reason, the quality of the songs on this one album have been unsurpassed by Joni on very few since, there are no bad tracks and every one could quite easily feature on a greatest hits album. There is a surprising depth to her vocals that you wouldn't expect initially, she sounds very willowy and light at first take, but after repeated listening you sense every nuance and intonation a great deal more. This is a wonderful album and one I rate very highly (no surprise from this glowing review eh!) and you can often snap this up for a great price on Amazon. This album is well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00498YZH8|1.0|Not sure why this movie is so popular. I had to fight to stay awake during this terrible movie. A movie about a bunch of back woods meth heads. This movie is more of a character study than a suspense, drama, or thriller. The problem with the character study is that the characters are not really worth studying.
B00006RU5B|5.0|`Audioslave' is an awesome album that still manages to plaster a huge grin on my face and lift my spirits even after repeated listening. This is the powerful debut from the band and blends perfectly the raw power of RATM with Cornells searing vocals and you are left with one strong sound overall. From the album opener `Cochise', via `Set It Off' and `Getaway Car' you get a mix of thumping rock and more nuanced music on one album and this manages to deliver an overall package without a dud track on it. Produced by the excellent Rick Rubin you know this will be something special and with the bands unique sound and Rubin's production they more than pull it off. This is one of my all time favourite albums and although I am a fan of both the previous bands that the members played in, I tend to see this as a separate unit and it more than stands up in it's own right. Great music, great band, great album. Give it a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is an excellent sequel to the Percy Jackson series. A definite page turner! I can't wait for the next book!
B001BN1ZHW|4.0|As a fan of Tim Burtons films I had high hopes for 'Sweeney Todd' and from the distinctive opening credits I knew I was on familiar Burton ground and in for a treat. The direction, make-up, costumes and sets are wonderfully atmospheric and give that dark feel to the film straight away. To be honest I found the musical aspect of this film got on my nerves by the end, but the acting and actual story itself was so good that I enjoyed the film immensely anyway. Depp is as great as ever and Sasha Baron Cohen was surprisingly good. This film isn't overly long and although the murders were quite gruesome at times, it didn't feel excessive or gratuitous, they were almost tongue in cheek in some ways. Alan Rickman plays an excellent 'baddie' again and all the supporting cast performed well. This is typical Burton fare (dark humour, distinctive styling and quirky music) and made for some great viewing. Well worth a look and I'd give this 3 1/2-4 stars.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B001IF5YLQ|3.0|This item seems to have limited color depth.  It looks like 16 bit color rather than 24 bit or Hi Color.  It works fine for static display of the desktop and applications, but falls on its face when displaying continuous tone still images or video.  Videos are heavily artifacted with obvious color bands and blocked up areas of shifted color due to video DAC quantization error.  My application required connection of an XGA projector with a VGA analog input (15 pin) connection to a MacBook.  Results were minimally acceptable for video.  The same projector works fine with a PC notebook that has a native VGA connector built in.  Photographers and videographers should pass up this item.  I got the Apple product due to reliability concerns with third party vendors.  I hope Apple lives up to my expectations for reliability.
B000002C2E|4.0|'Time Out Of Mind' has become one of those albums classed as a Dylan modern classic, as well as a comeback album. Considering he never really 'went away', I'd lean more towards the first description and this album really delivers on so many fronts. It has a really laid back feel and offers up a mix of chilled out music and superb lyrics. Highlights for me are 'Tryin' To Get To Heaven' which has some great lyrics and is well worth sitting quietly and soaking up properly and of course everyone's favourite on this album 'Not Dark Yet', although the whole album is pretty great. The booklet is a real let down, being a single piece of folded paper, but I guess the music is more important overall. You can usually snap this up for a great price and is well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000E33VWW|5.0|`Capote' explores the life of Truman Capote as he wrote his most well known book `In Cold Blood'. It follows him as he befriends one of the killers of a horrible murder and gains his trust to get information for the book. Capote (the man) comes across as narcissistic, egotistical and manipulative and yet you can't help but also find him at times both charming and funny. The film also looks at his friendship with Harper Lee and how they supported one another's literary careers. Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves every accolade he received for this film and his performance is spell binding, you are truly riveted by his every look and inflection. You may not have the most respect for Capote by the end of this film, but as far as bio-pics go this one is outstanding. If you've read `In Cold Blood' then this makes for interesting and relevant viewing and if not then I highly recommend you do so, it is an incredible piece of writing and puts this film in greater context. A film that is deserving of all it's praise and well worth a look.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0060853972|5.0|So, Terry Pratchet and Neil Gaiman teamed up to write a book about the Apocalypse. This is the result.    Not for the religious fundamentals, this book satirizes and takes potshots at everything from the story of the Banishment from Eden, to theories of the Antichrist (or in this book, Anti-AntiChrist), to pop culture depictions of demons, angels, God, and Satan. And it's pure ineffable greatness.    Basically, an Angel, Aziraphale, and a Demon, Crowley, are good friends, and upon hearing that the End of the World is looming, try to stop it, because they actually like humanity. Neither side is happy with this, believing that the Armageddon must happen. Also involved is the Antichrist, an 11-year-old boy who lives in a small town in England. Needless to say, things do not go according to plan, and barely according to prophesy; in this case, the prophesies (Nice and Accurate, of course) of a witch named Agnes Nutter.     It's funny, it's satirical, it's pure genius. You need a good working knowledge of religion to understand some of it, but the rest isn't hard. The humor tends toward Neil Gaiman's more subtle sensibilities at times, but that's fine for me. Great read, not long, worth every penny.
B000VDDWE2|3.0|`The Day After Tomorrow' is one of those films that is hugely flawed, has dubious science and yet is extremely entertaining. Following what would happen in the face of rapid ice age this film follows one mans attempt to get his scientific research listened to by those in charge, as well as his sons fight for survival in storm stricken New York. The acting is pretty good, the direction is great, the special effects are very impressive and overall this makes for a top apocalyptic film with a modern theme. Whilst the themes of climate change are not to be ignored, the catastrophic nature of the scenario depicted wouldn't be as extreme or rapid and yet if you put this aside this makes for engrossing and entertaining viewing and is worth a watch.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003PZEF0S|5.0|I was a big fan of David Tennant so was a little unsure of Matt Smith as the Doctor but after watching this series, I'm totally on board with him! He's different, but in a good way! Being able to watch this On Demand is awesome too. The whole series is awesome, every episode. Some are better than others but that's the way it always is!
B0002HTZJI|4.0|Having been at these gigs it was a fore gone conclusion that I'd buy this CD, but `Live In Hyde Park' has so much more to offer than a mere souvenir album for concert going fans. This shows RHCP at the height of their game, playing with verve and skill and showing just why they were the hottest ticket around in 2004 (and more than likely still today if they were performing). This double album gives us many tracks from `Californication' onwards, as well as a couple from 'Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic' and from the opener `Can't Stop' you know you are in for a real treat. It is difficult to pinpoint particular exceptional tracks as they are all pretty great, `Fortune Faded' is awesome and `Under the Bridge' got a huge crowd response. You also get Flea playing trumpet and a brief cover of `I Feel Love'. The Amazon review says that the support bands were jeered off the stage. Well James Brown wasn't jeered as everyone seemed pretty over-awed to see a master perform, `Chicks on Speed' were jeered and booed but then they were SO bad it can hardly be expressed, but more importantly the crowd were at fever pitch to see this band perform and from hearing this CD you can tell why. When you have RHCP about to perform their greatest hits to a massive crowd, who would honestly want anything else? For the only live album of this band this can't be beaten and for top rock music with a great audience vibe this is unsurpassed. Highly recommended indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|If you or your family are interested in horses or Secretariat in particular this isn't a bad place to start. It's also a good story to watch with your kids, no nudity or curse words, clean subject matter.<br /><br />But for people who have been interested in Secretariat since 1972 like myself, the movie was really lacking.<br />I felt it was more the story of Mrs. Tweedy and her family than it was about the greatest horse ever to step on a racetrack. The writers made up alot of the story, she wasn't there when he was born, I doubt she ever gave him a bath or showed up at the stable in her ball gown the night before the Belmont. But what do you want from Disney?<br /><br />Worth watching so you can see the amazing things Secretariat did on a racetrack but for me, too much Mrs. Tweedy and not enough Secretariat.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|First off it has to be said that 'Born To Run' is one of those albums that should be in everyone's music collection. Not only is it a groundbreaking album, but it still sounds as fresh and has full impact even after all of these years. With tracks such as 'Thunder Road' and 'Jungleland' (with the best sax solo you will ever hear) this album has track after track of sublime music. This 30th anniversary boxset has the remastered album, as well as a documentary DVD with interviews with all those involved in the albums production and another DVD of the excellent Hammersmith concert. The documentary is about 90 minutes long and is truly insightful into what went on in writing, recording and producing 'Born to Run', it also looks at some of the impact and hype the album created as well. The concert DVD shows Bruce in fighting spirit, winning over the London crowd with a storming set that shows just how great he is live. There is also a CD sized photo booklet with a small essay and loads of images of the band at that time. This is a great overall package and not only do you get one of the greatest albums of all time, but you get a deeper insight into it's conception and an amazing live performance to boot. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0045ODPKY|4.0|Guided by Phillip Noyce's masterful direction, \\"Salt\\" (2010) provides a memorable action vehicle for Angelina Jolie. This preposterously entertaining spy thriller moves at a fast clip with plenty of dynamic set-pieces and plot twists. Liev Schreiber effectively underplays his role as a pursuing CIA agent - an ideal counterpoint to Jolie's vigorous presence. Far superior to the recent Bond and Bourne entries.
B00104QSOM|4.0|'There Will Be Blood' brings us Daniel Day-Lewis in a masterly performance following the life of an oil prospector and the relationships he forges and ruins. Some of the first things to strike me were how this film is beautifully directed with marvelous use of light and shadow and how the soundtrack helps keep things on edge with various percussive elements and discordant notes. But the key to this film really is Day-Lewis' performance and the whole film rests on his portrayal of Daniel Plainview, never has a film rested so strongly on one actors supreme work. This film doesn't have any real resolution, although some parts are tied up, but this looks at the overall life of this brutal and savage man as he exploits both community and nature for his gains in oil. At 2 and 1/2 hours it did begin to feel a touch long towards the end, but Day-Lewis manages to hold you captivated by his rich and in-depth performance and keeps you watching until the very end. The supporting actors play their roles well and Plainviews son was especially note-worthy. A dark tale, in both content and execution, but one that should be watched at least once to soak up it's atmosphere, acting and beautiful direction.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|`Mezmerize' is the first half of SOAD's double album release and although it is a slight departure from their previous albums (only very slight mind you) you still get their distinctive sound, intelligent lyrics and amazing vocals from Serj. `Soldier Side' is the song that ties the two albums together, opening this album and closing `Hypnotize', but it swiftly leads on to one of my SOAD favourites B.Y.O.B which is pure exuberance. `Cigaro' is another stand out track for me and `Old School Hollywood' has a frenetic pace before leading you on to the more sedate and brilliant `Lost in Hollywood'. The artwork is excellent as you'd expect and with the album being produced by Rick Rubin you know the sound is going to be clear and completely apt for the band. If you're a fan of past SOAD albums this may take a few listens to get a feel for it but believe me, it will soon become another one of your favourite System albums. Simply great.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000002N25|5.0|'Golden Heart' is one of those albums that is rarely far from my stereo despite having it in my music collection for many years. It blends perfectly Knopflers voice, songwriting abilities and awesome guitar playing into one heavenly package. From the beautiful opener 'Darling Pretty' to 'Golden Heart' via the upbeat and fun 'Cannibals' and taking in the mournful melancholy of 'Rudiger' this album delivers so much emotion on one CD it almost demands repeated listening. The closing solo on 'Are We in Trouble Now' still gives me goosebumps even now and shows just how much power this album has. Knopflers later solo albums were hit and miss, but this one set the standard so high it was always going to be difficult to live up to it and this is the Knopfler album I keep coming back to. With searing beauty and lyrics that will leave you breathless, this is one CD I'll happily recommend above many others.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
031603438X|5.0|I loved this book. Sometimes, it seem like a book about addiction but the parts of it that are about music and his early life are so good, it's worth occassional forays into areas that aren't as interesting. If you love The Rolling Stones, this is a must read. Mick is the face of the Stones but Keith is the heart and soul.
B000PC0U1W|4.0|I came to this film expecting great things of the directors after loving the matrix trilogy so much. Sadly I was a little disappointed, but only a little. It is OK, but very stylised and the story seems a little aimless in places (hence the 4 stars). Hugo Weaving does an admirable job portraying his characters sentiments whilst restricted by a mask throughout and Natalie Portman does a good job with a rather poor character that seems to change her temperament a touch too frequently to be believable. For fans of action movies and graphic novels this should keep you entertained, at least as you pick holes in it afterwards!! Worth a viewing, but don't expect too much and you should be fine.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B003UMW68Y|5.0|'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of those wonderfully atmospheric films that has easily stood the test of time. It is as delightful and quirky now as when it was initially released. The stop-motion animation is superb and the dark Tim Burton Characters are perfect for the story. Danny Elfman provided the music and songs for this film and they stick in your head at first listen and you can't help but grin and sing along with subsequent viewings. The story is unique and fun and although it has a very dark turn to it, it is still fine viewing for children, although I tend to feel adults may appreciate it more. This is one film I watch annually (yes, at Christmas time!) as a matter of tradition now and I love it every time. A modern classic, and rightly so, and if you haven't seen this film you're missing out on a rare treat. Snap it up quick and enter it's weird and wonderful world.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I really liked this book because there were so many adventures within the story.  The author did such a great job describing the story and action that I could feel the way Percy felt when he was having trouble in classes and how he felt when his step father treated him so bad.  I also liked when Percy made new friends at summer camp.    I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and who has a good imagination.
B000008LIX|5.0|I can't begin to tell you how many happy hours I've spent listening to this album. From the raw and biting album opener 'Knives' you know you're in for a real treat and by the time you reached the end via songs such as 'Screamager', 'Nowhere', 'Stop It Your Killing Me' and every other track on this album, you'll feel both wrung out and exhilarated. This is one of those rare albums without a dud track on it and, in addition, one that has stood the test of time and still whacks a smile on my face every time I hear it. You can usually snap this up for a good price on amazon, but if you want great rock, with a high feel good factor, then any price is worth it where this album is concerned. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|What are movies for? To entertain! To get you excited and touch on all kinds of emotions to make you laugh or even cry. Or even better, both at the same time... A movie should draw you in so you completely forget your surroundings. It's about getting connected with what's happening. This movie is not able to do any of this. It doesn't scratch the surface so to speak. A trigger happy Van Helsing, who displays action for the sake of action. Lots of special effects that don't serve any purpose (I mean well done guys, but were they meant to scare? heck no!) Not much of a good storyline here. Loose sand. And another thing. Mid winter in Transsylvania and the whole village is dressed up in layers of potatosacks to keep warm, and here we have the lead actress dressed up like a mariachi gal (where was the mariachi hat or guitar by the way?), a thin look through cotton Indian blouse, accentuating her boobs (okay check we needed a sexy lady), Hollywood hair extensions (pleazzz). She sticks out like a sore thumb in that environment. In one scene she gears herself up with so MANY weapons, and the effect of it is, that it only looks ridiculous. You could already imagine how she would get into trouble during a fight and all these weapons would get in the way....<br />It's not funny, it's not scary, It's all Soooo damn silly. waste of money to make it, waste of time to watch it.
B00104W8T6|4.0|I have to start by saying that the songs selected for this film have created one of those soundtracks that fits the feel of the film perfectly. Kimya Dawson features heavily and her off-beat, quirky lyrics match Juno's nature perfectly. Apparently Ellen Page (who plays Juno) suggested the Mouldy Peaches to the director and he was so impressed that he asked Dawson to add more to the soundtrack. You get all the standout tracks from the film like 'All The Young Dudes' by Mott the Hoople, 'Superstar' by Sonic Youth and the delightful 'Vampire' by Antsy Pants, plus a load more that featured, but slipped through the net of your attention first time round. The album finishes with Ellen Pages duet with Michael Cera singing 'Anyone Else But You' which is endearing and the best way to end this collection. If you've seen the film you'll know what to expect and if not, all I can say is that this is an excellent, quirky and kooky collection of fun tracks and is well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000VDDWE2|4.0|The movie itself has a nice, solid message about global warming. I have no idea or what the odds with the disaster portrayed here, but the message is there. The story is told like other doomsday type movies, where the story is told through the eyes of key scientists and governing bodies. (It's not as intense as the latest 2012 and probably shouldn't be.)  And of course, human drama related to disasters and heroism. The visual effect is as good as anything offered these days, and the picture is sharp and clean consistent with best of blu-ray in 1080p.    WARNING: For viewers that pay attention to exceptional details, you might find various things just not believable (as one reviewer so fondly pointed them out). So if you are one of those, you may be stuck with having problems and not enjoy the movie.    Overall, it's a good movie to get as a home theater show case title, especially if the price hovers around $10.
0142000655|5.0|'East of Eden' shows yet again what a master John Steinbeck was. This manages to mix his usual poetic styling with a story of utmost cruelty, sadness and pathos that you are left profoundly moved and affected. This novel doesn't flow quite as easily as 'Grapes of Wrath' and has more asides to comment on the story and points being raised, but this made for a more in-depth experience and one that leaves you thinking about the themes to a greater degree. The introduction is very good, but be aware it has many spoilers and is best read after you've read the novel through, I didn't do this and some aspects of the story were slightly ruined as a result. Steinbeck has the power to draw you into the novel and make you delight at his turn of phrase and the emotions he evokes within you. You feel yourself despairing with certain characters and smarting at the injustices portrayed, as well as a whole host of other emotions, the mark of a great novel. This wont leave you feeling especially upbeat, but it will leave you profoundly moved and different from when you started it and I don't know about you but I cherish and respect that in any book. Snap it up and immerse yourself in the world of this book. HIGHLY recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|Amy Chua's \\"Battle Hymn\\" relives the turbulent experience of raising two daughters the \\"Chinese way.\\"  When I sat down to read Chua's memoir, I hoped to learn a bit about the Eastern culture and child rearing tradition.  No one can deny the impressive reputation of high standards, academic excellence and musical prowess among Asian school children.  As Chua insists, the liberal \\"Western\\" way of parenting produces lazy, overindulgent and ordinary children. In stark contrast, her \\"Chinese\\" style parenting demands focus, discipline and absolute excellence.<br /><br />Her story goes something like this: her two daughters, born three years apart, are shuffled from one piano and violin lesson to the next.  They are forced, literally, to practice their instruments anywhere from 3-6 hours each day, every single day, vacations included.  They are never allowed to indulge in typical \\"childish\\" and \\"American\\" traditions such as sleepovers and school plays. There are no acceptable grades but A's--in fact A-minuses are disgraceful failures.  Multiplication drills (hundreds of them) Mandarin lessons, classical music, computer programming classes and auditions become part of these girls' daily routine from kindergarten on.  The results (initially) are hard to argue with:  Sophia, the eldest daughter, becomes an accomplished concert pianist, performing at Carnegie Hall by her 14th birthday.  Her younger sister, Lulu, travels to Juilliard to perform violin for world-renowned professors by age 12.  They are both straight \\"A\\" students--the top of their classes.  And Sophia's writing skills are absolutely stunning (specifically, her \\"Young Juliet\\" essay).<br /><br />So what's the catch?  Chua maintains that her \\"Chinese\\" method (complete with wall shattering screaming, tears and a Britney-esque hair cutting incident) is fail proof.  Her daughter Lulu candidly admits that she hates her mother and hates being a member of the family.  By age 13, she's rebelled entirely refusing to comply with a single one of her mother's requests.  No more 20 hour days filled with stressful auditions, endless lessons and practice, homework and chores.  She's done.  The end result: \\"Chinese\\" family drama is just the same as ours (\\"Westerners\\").  In the end, despite her fail-proof method and high expectations, Chua's daughter exhibited the same back talk, undisciplined behavior she had desperately fought to suppress.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this memoir read more like a depressing Lifetime movie than a triumphant celebration of \\"Chinese\\" parenting.  I keep using quotation marks because I'm not thoroughly convinced Chua's way is the \\"Chinese\\" way.  I saw no hints of tradition, no family pride, no celebration of success; just a fanatic, overbearing mother with an all-out obsession to produce trophy children.  She didn't sell me on her way of parenting, though I do agree rather wholeheartedly with her philosophy regarding \\"Western\\" (American) parenting.  Standards are too low and children are lazy, undisciplined and underachieving.  However, Chua's way is no better alternative.  Still, it's an interesting story to read.  You can draw your own conclusions from there.ne of her mother's requests.  No more 20 hour days filled with stressful auditions, endless lessons and practice, homework and chores.  She's done.

B001TKK3O8|3.0|'Fracture' is your run of the mill crime thriller with a slight twist, in that we know the defendant actually did the crime from the outset. Hopkins plays the killer in a very dry way, there's no real menace and his accent that wavers from Irish to English in any one scene only undermines his performance further. Gosling is good as the prosecutor and plays his part well. You can pretty much guess the story from the word go and we had guessed the method and ending before the first half hour was up, but that didn't detract too much from the viewing experience. There was a whole sub-story about Gosling moving job to a private law firm that served to show his ambition but added little else to the overall story and was superfluous to the final outcome. As far as thrillers go this one is pretty inoffensive and easy going, it won't shock or leave you breathless but it does keep your interest for the duration and make for a couple of hours of entertaining viewing. Look past Hopkins dire accent and you should be fine!!!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I had a hard time relating to Darcy in the beginning of the book, maybe because I had grown to dislike her so much in Something Borrowed.

B0017V7GTY|4.0|`The 59 Sound' is another storming album from New Jersey boys The Gaslight Anthem. On this album you get a selection of short, punchy tracks that can't help but put a smile on your face and leave you feeling uplifted. It's simple, good rock music that lives up to the legacy of New Jersey musicianship. There are a few Springsteen references on this album that fans of his will notice and will produce a wry smile. The title track stands out, as does `The Backseat' but to be honest there aren't any dud tracks on this album and although it is short, it manages to pack song after song of great music in. Top riff after riff and hook after hook will keep you coming back for more and this makes for one highly recommended album indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B001EOQWF8|4.0|`Wall-E' is a better than average film from the Pixar studios that brought us gems such as `Toy Story' and `Monsters Inc'. After the studio's recent lack lustre outings `Wall-E' is a return to form, with the usual slick and polished animation but with a good story this time, it manages to captivate and charm you most of the way through. Following a clean-up robot (Wall-E) on earth and the romance that develops with a probe robot (EVE) sent to find life, this story manages to be endearing without the usual saccharine sweetness American films love so much. Ok, you get cute characters and the flowing music, but they don't seem out of place and sit very well with the overall storyline. Wall-E then follows EVE back to her mother ship, the Axiom, where humankind has been living after polluting earth to such a degree they had to leave. The plot then follows their romance and what happens when the captain of the ship finds a plant inside EVE and what it may mean for his passengers. As you may expect there is a happy ending and the various funny touches Pixar is renowned for and underlying this is a moral message about polluting earth and our unsustainable way of life, that thankfully isn't rammed down your throat. Overall this is a beautifully animated film, with a great main character and a story to keep you hooked for the 90 minutes duration. Worth checking out if you're a fan of Pixar films and animation in general.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I just finished watching \\"Red\\" and I loved it.  I rented it here on Amazon VOD and I am considering going to buy the Blue Ray for keeps.  It is not often that I finish watching a movie and I want to see it again.  The action was great.  There were twists, surprises and laughs.  Predictable, some parts, but it didn't take away from the movie at all.  I wasn't familiar with this movie before watching it but I'm so glad I chose to watch, it really made my night.
B000N6U0EC|5.0|This is another fine performance from Will Smith, who plays Chris snr. I tend to feel that after his performance in Ali, he only seems to be getting better. This has some really touching on-screen moments with his son (which are all the more poignant knowing it's Smiths real son) and shows how far a man will go to provide and care for his family. You feel his frustrations as he faces each new setback with strength and determination and you feel yourself rooting for him the whole film. The relationship between Chris snr and his wife are hard to watch as you see their marriage breakdown and unless you've been in that kind of situation I guess you'll never know how hard it can be. This film also has some lighter moments that will raise a smile and I have to say it is a film i enjoyed way more than I expected to and would recommend to anyone out there. Give it a go and judge for yourself.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000UNYJV8|4.0|'This Is England' is a pretty stark and hard hitting look at skin head culture and life in 1980's England. It follows a young boy who becomes friends with a group of skin heads and the things in society that influenced them. It is expertly inter-cut with realtime footage from the Falklands war and other events from 1983 (when this film is set) and the actors are all pretty good at portraying the influences in England at that time. Some of the violence is quite brutal and it is depressing to see such harsh attitudes that were in England then. The main character is quite good in this, his first film, and the rest of the cast add the right mix of naivety (to be influenced so readily) and menace that they needed to have for this story to have it's full impact. This film has been highly lauded and it is very good indeed. It's well worth a viewing, but it can be quite graphic at times. A solid four stars.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

0143039482|4.0|`The Winter of Our Discontent' is a slight departure for Steinbeck in that this isn't set in the Salinas valley or California. It has a different feel to his past novels with the themes of human greed and also with a slightly different style to the prose and yet it still has the splendour and amazing technique that Steinbeck is famous for, and which I've grown to love. You still get his lush descriptions, and turns of phrase that encapsulate a feeling or scene in a few perfectly chosen words. The story itself is completely absorbing and as with all of his novels, once you start reading it is very hard to put this down. Written towards the end of his career and when he was living in New York with his last wife you can see the influences of this change come out in his writing, but this in no way detracts from the overall feel, if anything it adds to it. If you've enjoyed any of his past novels then this one will not disappoint and if you're new to Steinbeck I wouldn't recommend this as your first try (maybe Grapes Of Wrath or Cannery Row) but you should definitely come back to it at some point soon. Well worth a read.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Regardless of how you feel about facebook, other social networking sites - or pretentious Harvard geniuses, this movie is a must see. It has all the requirements of a truly great motion picture experience: brilliant script, fantastic score, AMAZING cast and performances, drama, intrigue, soaring achievement, heartbreaking treachery.....!  Wow, what a film. Justin Timberlake stands out for me as the wily Sean Parker, especially when he gets caught doing something, say, slightly less than legal, and embarrassing Zuckerberg and Facebook in the process.  As 'Seabiscuit' was so much more than a horse racing movie, 'The Social Network' is so much more than a movie about facebook.  Do not miss this one.
B000067CPX|5.0|`By The Way' is one of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers best albums by a long shot. From the album opener `By The Way', with that driving bass and catchy as hell lyrics, you know you're in for one sweet ride. This has a good mix of rocky and softer songs and stand out tracks for me are `The Zephyr Song', the exuberant `Cabron' and the superb album closer `Venice Queen' which is the ultimate way to end such a strong collection of songs. Produced by Rick Rubin you knew RHCP were in safe hands and they have more than delivered after their awesome Californication album. Frusciante is on top form, Flea is as frantic and pumping as ever, Chad shows how he is still one of the most solid drummers out there and Kiedis brings his unique lyrics and vocals to the overall package. This is one of my favourite summer albums and it is the one that solidified them at the top of their game before the seminal Hyde Park concerts. This is well worth a listen.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1400052173|5.0|The author spent much time and exhaustive effort to put together a true story that at times moves along like fiction, and presented characters that had me totally engaged.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|`Brave New World' sees the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith and the result is this supreme metal album. From the opening riff of `Wicker Man' you know you are in for a treat and Bruce's vocals, joined with the harmony guitars and Harris' romping bass and lyric ideas makes for one solid album. This is one of those maiden albums without a bad track on it, but for me `Ghost of the Navigator' and `Thin Line Between Love and Hate' really stand out. I saw them live for this tour and there seemed to be none of the previous animosity and they produced the thumping metal from this album in spades. You get the obligatory Eddie album artwork, as well as all the lyrics in a decent booklet (makes a change from the rubbish digi-pack formats you seem to get everywhere these days.) If you're a fan of maiden then this is a must have album and it is one of my favourites of theirs and if you're new to them then this isn't a bad place to start either.

1439163146|2.0|`Palo Alto' is a collection of short-stories from Golden Globe winning actor, James Franco. Franco, as well as being an actor, artist and soon-to-be Oscars host, studied writing at Brooklyn College. `Palo Alto' is the accumulation of his studies, and a life spent growing up in the Palo Alto area. . .<br /><br />I admit that I wouldn't have been interested in this collection of short stories if they weren't penned by the (hunky) Franco. I've liked him since `Freaks and Geeks', but especially for his winning portrayal of James Dean in a biopic. More than that though, I quite like actor-author books; Steve Martin and Dawn French amongst my favourites. So I was willing to put my crushing on Franco aside and give his first literary foray a read and earnest review . . .<br /><br />All of the stories are all set in Palo Alto, a Californian charter city. At its worst, the stories are along the lines of Seinfeld's `a show about nothing' . . . random snatches of nothingness amidst the mundane, with healthy doses of teen angst and selfish shenanigans.<br /><br />But then some of Franco's stories are more akin to the E4 `Skins' storytelling. Set in a fairly disinteresting town, Franco tells tale of drunken teen hijinks, with dark undertones (from a careless teenagers' hit and run to a girl witnessing a boy's beating death at a house party).<br /><br />It's that sort of anti-Gossip Girl aspect of teen life. Not dissimilar to `Skins', in that the stories are about an ordinary American town, with ordinary American kids doing ordinary (if hair-raising) things. There's a lot of truth here, told in a stark and cold manner.<br /><br />But while reading `Palo Alto' I couldn't help but think James Franco's work is a little self-indulgent. Sometimes it's startlingly obvious that Franco is just a recent literary graduate whose favourite book is J.D. Salinger's `Catcher in the Rye' and he's trying to write a pale, contemporary comparison. Some of the `Palo Alto' stories do read like the English 101 homework of an angst-ridden Emo teen. And it's a shame. Because if these weren't frayed short-stories with only the Palo Alto setting to connect them . . . if Franco had an actual plot to revolve these characters around, he could be great. If there was a plot-trigger, something to kick-start these mundane snatches of life, then Franco could be like the next Donna Tartt - writing about young-adult mundanity with dark undertones.<br /><br />As it is, `Palo Alto' is a glimpse at what James Franco can do, but not his best work.

B00139XZF4|3.0|'The Golden Compass' is a good family, fantasy adventure and starts off being very promising. The children actors aren't too bad to watch, Kidman is very good, the various plot elements were intriguing and the effects were of good standard. This had a great cast of both on screen actors, as well as voice over actors and the costumes and sets were pretty impressive. I enjoyed the film most of the way through until I reached the ending which left so much unresolved and set itself up for a sequel. It was SO frustrating to end a film like this that it coloured my overall feelings towards the entire film. I like trilogy type films and those that spread a story over many sequels, but I also like each separate film to be resolved enough to leave you feeling satisfied with two hours viewing and intrigued to find out what will happen next. This left me with none of that. It is a shame that what seemed to be a good film, with a good premise and well directed and acted, shot itself in the foot in such a way. This is worth a viewing if you like fantasy adventure films, but just be aware that you'll have to expect a sequel to resolve the story.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B0029LHWFO|4.0|`Dreams From My Father' is Barack Obama's heartfelt memoir looking at his childhood, organisational career in Chicago and return to visit his families roots in Kenya. It is extremely candid and portrays his frustrations and anxieties growing up as a black man in America, as well as his attempts at affecting change in run down areas of Chicago and the effect this had on him. You quickly become immersed in the story he tells and the descriptions of the people in his life are richly detailed and vivid. The part where he returns to Kenya is both fascinating to read and moving and makes for the most engrossing part of the book. His early life in Hawaii and Indonesia also makes for interesting reading and you realise what a diverse life he has lead. Used by his opponents to garner negative information about him, it is a shame that such a personal and heartfelt memoir could be twisted for more negative ends. It should primarily be appreciated for what it is, an honest, open look at one mans life and the journey he took to reconciling his past fears with his future aspirations. Considering he is now the American president this book is bound to gain more attention than it may have previously, but never the less this makes for an interesting read that leaves you with a deeper insight into what moves the man behind the politics. Worth a look.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0393317552|5.0|This is a book that should be read by everyone.  In fact, I think it should be mandatory reading in high schools. Diamond makes the only logical and clear (if not concise) non-racist argument I have seen for why recent human history has played out the way it has.  This is a testament to critical thinking.  It's the kind of book that makes you feel smarter and more aware of your surroundings.  He makes each of his points so clearly that the reader draws the conclusions his or herself before Diamond does, which makes his arguments seems stronger.  The book is not condescending and does not assume that you should know about human history. If you haven't read this book, you should, and if you have read this book, give it to a friend!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|`Hypnotize' is the second half of the double album release from SOAD and as I mentioned on my `Mezmerize' review, the sound is slightly (but only slightly) different to past albums, but still manages to retain their own distinctive style. You get their unique sound, great lyrics and vocals and as much passion as on all their other albums. `U-Fig' is a particular favourite and I could listen to `Holy Mountains' over and over (and frequently do!) where the passion and vitriol shines through oh so clearly. `Lonely Day' was released as a single and EP and is a great softer track on this album before leading you to the album closer `Soldier Side', which links the two albums together (it is the opener on `Mezmerize') and it sandwiches the tracks in between perfectly. Again, the artwork is great and Rick Rubin is at the producing helm crafting another superb album. Worth a listen for all fans of SOAD and a top album in general.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I've bought this documentary about life on Earth and I thought would find just another good filmwork. But I was surprised by the blu-ray images and precise narrative of life events as seen nowadays by the biological science. I strongly recommend this doc for everyone wanting to know more about our planet and the role of life on it. The price is also correct for what it brings to you. The last thing: I have only waited 3 weeks to receive it in my home address in Brazil!
B001EIOOWC|3.0|'Eastern Promises' is a film about a midwife who inadvertently become embroiled in the world of the Russian mafia in London. It has plenty of intrigue and a few plot twists and then sadly fizzles out at the end, leaving you feeling rather dissatisfied (hence the 3 stars). It could have delivered so much more and had plenty of scope for an additional twenty minutes or so to tie up loose ends and leave the viewer with a complete ending. In it's favour it has some pretty good performances from Vigo Mortensen and Naomi Watts, but it pays to be aware that there are some quite violent scenes in this film. If you're looking for a short film with enough of a storyline to keep you engaged and don't mind an ambiguous ending then this is the place to go, personally I was left feeling rather deflated and without a feeling of resolution.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1847879071|5.0|I'm going after my PhD and got more out of this book in the week of studying for my comprehensive exam than I have gotten in 4.5 years of grad school. I started out as a qualitative man, but somehow my proposed dissertation took a U turn and now it looks like its going involve a quantitative analysis utilizing a customized instrument and an independent t-square method (see: improvresearch.com) ... Got me thinking ...W.T.F ... you know ...those three days on the calender that that come after Tuesday.    Doc Andy wrote the SPSS Bible, and I will be carrying it with me for the next two years and beyond. The only criticism I have is that with his sense of humor, I'm surprised he didn't tie an example of leptokurtic and platykurtic distributions in with a Playtex preference (bet he thought about it)... then again ... Stats-Andy knows where to draw the line (esp on  SPSS) and with this book, you can learn to do it too.    P.S. If you haven't heard the secret message in a Brittney Spears song when it's played backwards, check out his companion website and watch the lecture on Chapter 2 ... I'm telling you ... this guy is a hoot !    P.S.S. Andy , if you read this, don't forget to put the check in the mail.
B0000028RR|5.0|`Rage Against the Machine' is one of those albums that should be in any discerning music collection. From the album artwork alone and the choice of band name you know you aren't going to be in for the usual manufactured `music' that seems to dominate the industry these days. This is heavy music, with substance and meaning and is all the more powerful for it. My personal favourites on this album have to be `Killing in the Name' and `Bullet in the Head' but all of the tracks are excellent and `Wake Up' is one of the most well known after being used in the first Matrix movie. As soon as I put this album on I feel the smile spread across my face and by the end of the first track I'm usually beaming like a fool, which then lasts for the albums duration. This is perfect summer music, but always picks me up in the depths of winter as well. A superb album and a good place to start if you've not tried any other RATM.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000001EGE|5.0|I first heard this album back in about '77 when I was 'young' and I'm still listening to it today. Wonderful, if not the best he produced. And for just 8 bucks!    Dont hesitate, buy it, enjoy it.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|'The Darjeeling Limited' is another kooky gem from Wes Anderson and if you know 'The Life Aquatic' or 'Royal Tenenbaums', then you'll know what to expect. The direction is very stylised but completely captivating. Owen Wilson is hilarious, as are Adrian Brody and Jason Schwartzman. The relationship between the brothers is very believable and the dialogue and their familiarity add real appeal to the overall story. There are many wonderful scenes and I found Brody's dry delivery of some lines only heightened the humour in them. The storyline is charming, about reconnecting with family and resolving past issues, and it meanders along at a gentle pace, but manages to hold you attention for the whole duration. There is also a short film at the start involving Schwartzman and Natalie Portman which is both touching and a serendipitous addition. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to all fans of Anderson's past work.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000001EUL|3.0|Lovedrive is where it completely fell apart as far as getting any kind of enjoyment out of the Scorpions goes.  Starting here, they were obviously going for a more commercial sound and in the process, completely disregarding quality songwriting, vocal melodies, guitar solos and riffs.  The Scorpions would never again return to their glory years when songwriting was their number one biggest concern.  Now it's all about popularity, selling albums, and gaining success... and making the music significantly worse.    It's clearly obvious from the first song.  \\"Loving You Sunday Morning\\" is almost impossible to sit through thanks to a terribly bland guitar riff, verse melody, and what strikes me as an average attempt to try and fool listeners with a chorus that isn't the least bit interesting.  It *tries* to be interesting though, but it's too late- the signs of going generic and bland have officially been made clear.    \\"Always Somewhere\\" honestly makes me gag because it tries to be an emotional power ballad but... it's not the least bit emotional.  A failed attempt to make me tear up, and nothing more.  Everything down to the terrible vocal melody makes me sick.  I normally enjoy power ballads too, but this... this?  The Scorpions were a HECK of a lot better than this just a few years earlier.      The title song has a chorus that borders on mindlessly simplistic and downright annoying thanks to the lead singer sticking exclusively to a high-pitched range, and \\"Holiday\\" is probably the best cut here (though it wouldn't hurt to cut down on its length by a minute or so).  \\"Coast to Coast\\" is a pretty good guitar instrumental.  It's quite heavy and melodic, something I can't really say about the rest of the material.    I personally will remember the Scorpions for their early days when the songwriting, the excitement and the vocal melodies added up to one really cool experience.  Unfortunately most people are apparently just the opposite- they choose to remember the Scorpions for their successful hair metal days while ignoring the early stuff which, quite frankly, is disturbing.
B000WAGVHE|4.0|`Hairspray' manages to achieves exactly what it set out to do, be a larger than life, colourful and fun musical movie. This film has a pretty great cast, what with Travolta as a woman, Christopher Walken as a gentle, encouraging dad, pfeiffer as the bitchy station manager, as well as Queen Latifah, Zak Efron and the great Nikki Blonksy as the main character Tracy. This film is full of catchy tunes and great dance routines and although I hate to say it my feet were tapping on more than one occasion. The main story is pretty light hearted (miss hairspray pageant), with a serious theme underneath (racial integration) and manages to mix both well without being too heavy or too cheesy. Everyone plays their roles well and although some songs are better than others, it manages to be a pretty good musical and if you're a fan of the genre this should be right up your street. I'm not a huge fan of musicals and I still found this to be pretty good! This shake and shimmy edition has an extras disc that has a sing-along feature, as well as a menu where you are taught the dance moves from the film. This allows those hardcore fans to dance and sing along each time they watch the film, a good idea even if not for me! Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
031603438X|5.0|I am a huge Rolling Stones fan. I bought this book for myself for Christmas and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! It's nice to know that Keith is not some crazy nut ball that some people portray him as. He's a loving man with a great family. He's had his share of ups and downs in life, kicking a major drug habit. I absolutely love this book. It shows a side of Keith Richards that some people may not be aware of.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|`Dire Straits' is the debut album from this now legendary group. It has the classic and still potent `Sultans of Swing' with that solo that all learner guitarists try to master at some point. Along with tracks like `Six Blade Knife', `Wild West End' and `Lions' this makes for one very fresh and clean sounding album. There's no heavy distortion on the guitars like `Money For Nothing' or dark brooding music like `Brothers in Arms' but there is wonderful song writing and great musicianship. The remastered version I have has new liner notes giving some history to this album and overall this is a brilliant album that shows the potential in this group that they then went on to live up to. Well worth adding to your collection.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00000ILDE|5.0|While I will always appreciate \\"Alien\\" for the masterpiece that it is, \\"Aliens\\" is just more fun to watch.  Everything about it is thrilling, fast-paced, with entertaining yet strong acting, and of course great monster action.  The extended edition (aka \\"The Director's Cut\\") adds many great new scenes, mostly with the marines -- and that's a definite plus.  Weaver, of course, does a splendid job, but I have to say that a very young Bill Paxton steals the show whenver he's on screen -- Hudson is a great character and really makes you laugh when you need to, and be fearful when you need to.  \\"Alien\\" will always be the scariest of the series, but \\"Alien\\" is more clearly a horror flick.  \\"Aliens,\\" with it's focus not just on the creatures but on the innovative vision of \\"space marines,\\" is more of a space adventure but with horror elements.  And it is a stand-alone picture -- you 'can' watch \\"Aliens\\" without ever having watched \\"Alien,\\" though it works better if you saw the original first.  All in all, one of the best Sci Fi/horror movies ever -- and one of the few sequels in history to -- arguably -- outdo the original.
B00000J7JO|5.0|`Californication' is easily one of RHCP best albums and even after all these years it still sounds fresh. With Frusciante back in the fold and Rick Rubin producing you knew this was going to be something good and you aren't left disappointed. With amazing tracks like `Parallel Universe', `Scar Tissue' the title track `Californication' and the excellent `Road Trippin', this album shows the harder and softer side of RHCP and how diverse they can actually be. This album, with `By The Way', is rarely out of my stereo during the summer and they are the perfect soundtrack to those brighter months. Fun music to put a smile on your face and get you pumped up, what more could you ask for. Well worth a try if you liked their other stuff and a good first place to go if you're new to the band. It deserves all the accolades it gets.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|I loved this movie. This was the first movie I ever watched on an iPhone which probably added the the claustrophobia inherent with a movie entirely set in a coffin. Having ear buds in really blocked out the entire outside world and kept my attention glued to my little phone screen. Ryan Reynolds is excellent in this movie display a wide array of emotions. If you read reviews of this movie people either love it or hate it.<br /><br />This movie had the best ending I've seen since Inception. The story here is nowhere as deep as Inception, but it was the most engaged I've been in a story in months. The setup is very similar to Phone Booth with Colin Farrell from a few years back where the setting is basically one spot the entire movie, with lots of different voices on the phone.<br /><br />Whether you end up loving it or hating it watch it just the same, because it is way better than the predictable plots set in most movies put out by Hollywood these days.
B000W91RUG|5.0|To be completely honest I didn't really like `The Big Bang Theory' when I saw it on TV first. I found the idea interesting and some of the jokes funny, but never really laughed out loud. Then I saw an episode from a later series and found it hilarious and went back to this with a fresh eye and I found it a LOT more appealing. Following genius' Sheldon, Leonard and their friends who live in a nerdy parallel universe to everyone else, this has some great science based jokes. Sheldon is easily the funniest character with his literal interpretation of everyday events and his cold, logical reasoning, but the other characters raise many a laugh as well. The actor who plays Wolowitz is especially funny as a perpetually horny nerd. To see how they want to interact with `normal' people (especially the hot neighbour Penny) is quite endearing as they battle between their high IQ look of the world and wanting to be involved in regular social situations and this makes for plenty of funny scenarios. Each episode is only about 18 minutes long and these are great to put on when you have a few minutes spare. If you know a bit of basic science then these jokes will be all the more funny, but it is in no way a prerequisite. Well worth a look and if you don't like it first time round it's worth trying again. Never has geek chic been so funny.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|I rarely review movies, but this one was so disappointing I had to put a quick review. I grew up watching GI Joe, and playing with the action figures as a kid. This was so bad I didn't even finish the whole thing, instead fast forwarding through much of it. There were so many characters it was confusing, to the point I never really cared about any of them.<br /><br />This reminds me what happened to the Batman Movies in the 90's. They were so crappy for so long that when Batman Begins came out everyone was so shocked it was actually good. I think there is a good GI Joe movie out there waiting to be made by a good director with a good story but this one certainly was not it.<br /><br />Granted this was probably aimed at teenagers and the newer Batman movies aimed at adults but this was so bad I had to warn others to not waste their time.
B001AR4K8K|4.0|`The Lost Boys' is an eighties cult classic vampire movie with the best soundtrack of any film from that era. Following Michael who is tricked into becoming a vampire and his brother who tries to save him, this film has plenty of dark humour, as well as gory scenes and a twist on traditional vampire lore. It has great performances from Jason Patric and Keifer Sutherland and Corey Haim and Corey Feldman are together again for more eighties teenage high jinx. This is one of those films that although dated in places, has stood up remarkably well and is great to watch for that blast from the past that never fails to delight. Sit back and enjoy a cult vampire movie at it's very best.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Loreena always reaches extraordinary levels of delightful beauty through her music, something which makes a possible attempt of classification of  her music quite condemned to failure from the very beginning, since all the other artists of  all the musical genres, in which Loreena `s music is occasionaly categorized, lie lightyears behind .  Her latest album is nothing else but an additional proof of the above.  Another ageless masterpiece!
B0014DFCMS|5.0|'Juno' manages to achieve exactly what it set out to be, a feel good, inoffensive, funny film. It manages to mix hilarious, laugh out loud moments, with more poignant moments and Ellen Page has an ability to deliver dialogue in a way that will make you smile even before the punchline. The first half is the funniest, where as the second half becomes a touch more serious as it resolves the issue of the film, Juno's teenage pregnancy. The soundtrack is great (so much so I bought it) and compliments the various scenes perfectly. I didn't expect to enjoy this quite as much as I did and for that reason alone it was a happy surprise. There are mixed reviews for his film here, but if you want an easy going film, that is excellently acted, with great music and with an interesting enough storyline, then this is the place to go. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0312370849|5.0|[[ASIN:0312370849 Sarah's Key]]  Had to read this book after seeing the movie.  Enjoyed the greater detail in the book.  A great story - sadly based on terrible factual events  of which I had no knowledge.
B000MCH5TK|3.0|'Babel' is a slow paced, slightly melancholy film that follows four different stories and the links between them. It is a lot more coherent to watch than '21 Grams' which was made by the same director and makes this more enjoyable as a result. The stories are a touch aimless at times and the endings, whilst linking up well, aren't very powerful. But I guess life is like that, you have events that have a major impact and then you keep on going, plus we are a lot more connected than we first realise. I guess that is what this film is trying to put across. The performances were excellent, especially Chieko, the japanese deaf-mute girl, where you really feel her frustrations and vulnerability and Brad Pitt who is better than I thought he'd be. The soundtrack, which is quite sparse, allowing the atmosphere of the film to permeate through, was moving when it had to be and was far enough in the background when most appropriate. The ending piece of music was especially moving and added perfectly to the final scene. This is a good film and worth a watch, it has no definite beginning, middle and end, but that in no way detracts from the various stories and their impact, although I feel that may have disappointed other reviewers here. Give it a view and decided for yourself, especially if you like the feel of '21 Grams' but not the convoluted or confusing storyline.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003VYAVGA|5.0|I have been a huge Robbie fan since the \\"Ego Landed\\" in the states.  When I heard he rejoined the group I was concerned.  While I do enjoy Take That, their styles had developed so differently, and I was worried that Robbie might lose his individuality. They have all done a great job on this album.  Robbie's voice and style are all over Progress.  I look forward to future projects.
B001EIOOVS|4.0|Based on a true story 'American Gangster' takes us on another gangster style journey, but made refreshing as not based around the Mob or Italian stereotypes. As other reviewers here have noted, this film stands out by the great performances of both Washington and Crowe and they both add depth and flair to their respective roles. I was hooked in the first ten minutes and although Washington plays a flawed character, you can't help but like him. Excellently directed and with great supporting actors as well, this film managed to hold my attention for the duration. If you like crime and gangster films then this rates pretty highly and is well worth a look and even if you're not a fan of these films this has enough on offer to appeal to everyone else as well. A solid four star film.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This was a fun movie, with a plot that was more character driven than anything else -- the actual storyline was quite simple and silly: two villains compete to steal and shrink the moon. This sort of storyline, obviously, depends on more than just the story to make it enjoyable, or not.<br /><br />Despicable Me succeeded in including the right \\"more\\", and the movie was very fun. Gru, the main character villain, is a villain who pops kids' balloons, has an Iron Maiden in his living room, and has a savage \\"dog\\" who attacks him; for all of this, he's not really a bad guy -- at least, by the end of the movie.<br /><br />When a cookie-selling trio of orphans turns out to be his only hope at attaining the weapon he needs to shrink the moon, Gru becomes a father. His obvious cluelessness at parenting, we can guess, is a result of his mother's interactions with him as a child, which were hardly motherly. However, Gru, the trio of orphans, and the bizarre yellow creatures Gru has living in his basement, end up coming to understand one another, and life (as we all knew they would). But, they do this in a highly entertaining way, that is a lot of fun to watch. Gru really is a funny, likable character, and the others are pretty entertaining as well.<br /><br />I rate this 5/5 stars -- a very good job, and an enjoyable film, on a flimsy premise.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|`The Battle of Los Angeles' is the storming third album from RATM. You get more of their unique sound, more vitriolic and pertinent lyrics and an overall feel to get you motivated and pumped up. I love `Mic Check' and listen to this song loads as I walk to and from work, as well as the incredible `Testify' and `Calm Like The Bomb', all strong tracks on an overall strong album. Some people rate this down against their first album and although the debut had a certain urgency, this album more than stands up in it's own right and provide plenty to delight new and old fans alike. The musicianship is still way up there and the drumming, guitar and bass all fuse together in their own unique sound that accents the lyrics perfectly. If you already like RATM you shouldn't be disappointed and if you're new to the band this is well worth a try. Still sounds fresh and relevant after all these years and not many bands can say that!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0001I55OC|5.0|Imagine something like a \\"Time Machine\\" (the book) twist on LotR...you will have Timeline.<br /><br />(mild spoilers)<br /><br />The movie focuses on a modern-day set of archeologists who are sent back in time to Castlegaurd, France, during the Hundred Year War, to find a friend who was also sent back. Along the way, they meet characters, form relationships, and discover secrets that will, ultimately, change the course of history. Or, will they?<br /><br />The synopsis is simple enough, but the story is far more complex and entertaining than a simple \\"summing up\\" can indicate. The cast is great; Gerard Butler's history-buff archeologist, Marek, is one of his best performances IMHO. British actress Anna Friel's French Lady Claire is also superb. The film moves quickly, keeping your interest, but not too quickly to sacrifice anything.<br /><br />Now, I mentioned that this was something like a time-travel twist on LotR; let me further refine that to say a time travel twist on the human, pre-defeat of Sauron world of LotR. In other words, the world is not the shiny white walls and delicate beauty of Rivendell, nor even the polished majesty of Gondor after Aragorn's return; this is more like the battle for Helm's Deep -- dark, gritty and not at all a perfect, idealized world...more like a 14th century, war-torn area would be.<br /><br />Finally, let me say this...people have complained that this was not as good as the book. It was not the *same* as the book, but I think far better. These characters are actually likable, and you have no compunction cheering for them. There is more to compel you to \\"their side\\" than the fact that they are the protagonists of the story. That said, most people I know who loved the book didn't like this, at least as a representation of the book. So, if you love the book and want to try this film, perhaps think of it as a different story. :)<br /><br />5/5 stars
B000VI6T6K|5.0|'Live At Monterey' brings us the concert that unleashed Jimi on America. Up until this point he had been a hit in the UK but overlooked in America and then he hit the stage at Monterey and everything changed. In a highly charged performance Jimi showed why he was so respected and what he could do with a guitar. Still sounding fresh and raw in this concert he managed to pull off power and energy in songs like 'Like A Rolling Stone' and 'Purple Haze' whilst giving nuanced playing and a gentle touch in 'Wind Cries Mary', topped off with the infamous 'Wild Thing' where he sacrificed his guitar in love for the audience (and a healthy dose of showmanship!). This CD comes with the obligatory essay booklet with superb photos that the Experience Hendrix releases always offer and this makes for insightful and fascinating reading. As far as live Hendrix performances go this one really cannot be missed or surpassed, he may have played longer and better elsewhere, but this concert has a fire in it's belly and a strong piece of music history all in one place. Highly recommended indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000002KAT|4.0|`Astral Weeks' is probably one of Van Morrisons best known albums and is now also deemed a `stoner' classic! It has wonderful mix of jazz and folk, coupled with great lyrics. `Sweet Thing' is the most well known from this album, but tracks like `Madame George' and `Slim Slow Slider' are just as good, if not better. I was advised to listen to this album on repeat first time round, as the ending lyrics from the last song lead perfectly back to the start of the album. Sometimes I love this album and other times I wonder what the hype is all about. I have to be in the right mood and then I `get it' and I suppose that's why this album has a mix of good and bad reviews here. You can normally pick this up for a good price on Amazon and it's well worth giving a try to see what the fuss is about. It's become a classic album for good reason and I'd recommend a listen.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1596680199|5.0|Solid read and a must for a polymer crafter library. Cover the basics of clay, mixing, blending, forming, inclusions, layering, extruding (contains a wonderful technique I've never seen before), paint,  finishing and much more.<br /><br />There are plenty of techniques to keep a crafter busy. I do have to take off half a star as in areas pages can be a bit too crammed and you feel something has been glossed over but solid foundations are set for each techniques. As long as your willing to fill in with a bit of experimenting, the very heart of polymer crafting one would say, this book can take you a long way in developing a personal style.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|`Only By The Night' brings us another storming album from the Kings of Leon. You get more of those distinctive vocals and song writing that fans of past albums know and love. This has some outstanding tracks on it, from the well known `Sex on Fire' and `Use Somebody' to the excellent `Manhattan'. The album opener, `Closer' starts you off on good ground and shows you what delights this album has in offer. Although the whole album is pretty great, the one track that jarrs slightly is `17', with those chimes and different feel it sticks out like a sore thumb and is the only track you could skip without feeling too guilty about it. A minor point, but one worth noting, is that this comes in a decent CD case, with a decent booklet with all the lyrics, none of the now prevalent rubbish digi-pack and lack lustre packaging here! The KOL are a pretty prolific band and release an album of top music at a steady rate and this is no exception. Good rock music, great vocals and another great album, what more could you ask for. Worth a try for new and old fans alike.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1439177783|4.0|This is a good read. I did walk away thinking this girl is nuts and still has alot of work to do. I didn't get the sense she was really in a better place by the end of the book...more like a ticking time bomb hiding behind the fame of her famous wife.

I was so amazed, i fell into it and kept reading.  just disappointed he didn't give the tools about how to remove allergies.  If you are lokking for results and are ready to track down yourself and become your own guru about your own life, this book is made for you.  buy it, dive in it, sleep with it next to your bed and enjoy yourself and life more !

B00127RAJY|5.0|I was searching for something that I could do in a short amount of time without leaving the house.  This is the perfect DVD.  I put it in on day one thinking I might want to skip the first level.  I am so glad I did not.  This video kicked my butt on the first day and I am a pretty active person.  On the second day I was sore but made it through with less struggle.  I am looking forward to moving on to levels 2 and 3.  I haven't been doing it long enough to see results but I am certain if I keep it up everyday that it will give me the results I am looking for.

I would highly recommend this book, as it has something for everyone. Everyone could loose some pounds or put on some pounds, get some more sleep and have a better sex drive. It's not that expensive of a book, and I would just say: buy it. You're gonna enjoy it. It has some fun vingets and it's just enjoyable to read.

B003L20ICE|1.0|~   ****  spoiler alert  ****    So let me get this straight...    We have a neurotic, dysfunctional yuppie family where the parents happen to be a lesbian couple.  Their daughter seeks out the sperm donor who is her biological father.  Paul, played by an excellent Mark Ruffalo, is a flawed, never-been-married forty-something guy, but he is a warm, genuine, caring person.  They draw him into their life and involve him in their family.  He develops relationships with both of the children.    Julianne Moore comes on to him, they have an affair, they get found out, the family is shattered.  Moore and her partner, played by Annette Bening, manage to reconcile, but everyone hates Paul, who is left a broken man.  Then, Moore and Bening and their son get in their $60K SUV, hold hands, and head back to their entitled, self-absorbed life, leaving behind a daughter who seems blithely able to just... move on.      The performances by Mark Ruffalo and Mia Wasikowska (as daughter Joni) were excellent.  It was 60% of a decent movie with stupefyingly ham-handed conclusion, an ending that sent a chill up my spine for its sheer callousness.

B00479SVBU|5.0|This is an excellent product being sold at a reasonable cost. I researched online to locate an mp3 player which accepts expandable memory in the form of regular SD cards and flash. The fact that this device also functions as an FM transmitter makes it an even better choice. I live in the high frequency traffic area of Chicago and have so far enjoyed excellent sound quality, in terms of short range transmission. Of course, a direct connect sounds best; but if you don't have a regular aux input like those included in newer vehicle systems this works rather well.     I suggest a changeable power supply so that the player can also be used outside the car. However, I prefer that there is no need to worry about recharging or supplying batteries for vehicle use. Another improvement could be made in the form of a protective case. Of course, this would inevitably raise production costs. But consider this: As a consumer, I have already paid another retailer $10 for a general purpose case I had to go out and look for. I would have gladly given that money to Satechi for a nice custom design already provided.     Overall, this company gets 5 stars. It is obvious, given the make of this product and reachable customer service, that it deserves to compete with the likes of SanDisk or Apple. Keep up the good work, and I will shop again.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|This is the most over-praised album ever but that dosen't mean that it's not a darn fine album. It's fourth on my list (Revolver-Rubber Soul-Abbey Road) but when you're talking Beatles there's a very thin line between say number one fave and number six or seven, that is if you're well versed in ther catalogue. Now and then I come back to this album and always enjoy it's rich palate and virtuosity. It's the Fabs most \\"English\\" record. After three years of world wide acclaim the boys were looking inward and looking back. The single preceeding Pepper Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane had John and Paul waxing nostalgic about childhood places and memories, and this general feeling carries on through much of Pepper. For the anglophile their are many English references to pick up on, some obvious some more obscure. Some that with time and distance sound arcane but to an Englishman in '67 seemed like that day's papers. John singing \\"it's time for tea and 'Meet the Wife' for instance. Meet the Wife was a BBC afternoon soap opera. Paul singing \\"we could rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight\\" is another, and of course \\"Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite\\" is a tour de force of a nineteenth century English fairground and circus and throw in Ringo's pub sing along \\"With a little help...\\" to name a few. On top of all this and more we get the incredible freak out of \\"A day in the Life\\" and George's magical and mistical \\"Within you without you\\" a wonderful and exotic (even today) song.  Even the cover was inspired by a photo of a band Paul's father played with in younger day's. The large band is gathered behind a bass drum. This is a terrific and rewarding listen every time, and only this band could have a body of work that is not overshadowed by such an accomplishment.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|Probably the most under-rated movie of 2010.  One of the best uses of Clooney in this genre piece.  So much attention to image, frame, gesture, body language.   It gets better with repeated viewing.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|This book is full of unique ideas and theory's regarding diet & fitness. A little OCD (He will be the first to admit it) Tim has tried just about everything. I too consider myself obsessed with diet & fitness and some of his ideas are a little out there- even for me (yes, I tried the ICE BATH... ONCE! BURRRRR!!!!). BUT with that being said, there are also a lot of very helpful tips and advice that EVERYONE can incorporate into their daily life. His \\"slow carb\\" diet makes sense and he makes it easy enough to follow- however, I don't think this would be a LONG TERM lifestyle. But again (I know, I'm contradicting myself) it's a great BASE for your daily living. As you reach your fitness goals you don't need to be as HARD CORE about everything- I think maintenance can be a little more flexible. And think it would be a great program if you were training for competition or preparing for a wedding/vacation etc.     Tim also believes that men and women can train the same- I'm going to have to argue this theory. Not because women and men aren't equal or that one is better than the other, it's simply the fact that no 2 people are alike. What works for one person, may not work for another. Some people require more cardio than others- some can add muscle a lot easier than others. I for one, lift weights 4-6 times a week but recently found out that despite the fact that I eat apx 100-150 grams of protein a day am not absorbing it. Protein & iron- lucky me. So, it's just not that easy to say that everyone can train alike- there are too many exceptions to that rule. (just my opinion)     I read this book pretty quickly. I should probably go back and read it again. It's a pretty easy read. Tim's pretty funny. Matter of fact but a little extreme. If you are new to fitness/nutrition then I don't think I'd start with tim's book- it may be information overload. But if you're looking for some theory's and ideas that you may not have considered, it's a great option.     Good job, Tim. Even if you are a little psycho! ; )
0061245097|5.0|read the Twilight series book over and over and felt like I could'nt get enough of Edward and Bella. I decided to try this collection having read the reviews. Boy, was I glad I did. I have read the first two books and both I loved. I have just ordered the rest all at once since I know Im gonna love all of them. I highly recommend reading this collection. Their romance is unbelievable and the action in these books is awesome! If you are a twilight fan, read these books! But, I recommend these books for only adults (no teens) because of all the romance...
B003EYVXXW|5.0|There is a great deal of background information that the viewer should be aware of &lt; watching this film.  First off, Alexander of Macedon dreamed of an intellectual sanctuary where philosophers / scientists / acadamecians could come together and collaborate on their mutual quests to discover the truth about how the universe operates.  Alexander did not live to see his dream fulfilled, but one of his top generals, Ptolemy, set the groundwork for the tangible manifestation of Alexander's vision:  the library of Alexandria.<br /><br />After the demise of Athens in the Peloponnesian war, Alexandria would become the most cosmopolitan city of the ancient world.  It was a Greek city on Egyptian soil;  the architecture was mostly Greek and the denizens (in the beginning) were Greek as well.  Myriad intellectuals either visited the library or had their works stored at the library (Euclid, Archimedes, Hero, Aristarchus of Samos & Eritosthenes ~ just to name a few).  The entire literary canon of antiquity was stored at the library as well.<br /><br />The concept of the university is a product of the Middle Ages.  While this is an indisputable fact, one could easily argue that the Library of Alexandria was a predecessor to the university.  No less an authority than the late Carl Sagan described the Library as the first scientific institute.  Yes, it was that big of a deal!<br /><br />In 313CE Constantine the Great signed the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.  Within a century, Christianity went from a religion known for having its members persecuted to being a religion that routinely persecuted persons who were either areligious or followed other religions.<br /><br />That brings us to the crux of the current film:  the life & times of Hypatia of Alexandria.  She was an astronomer, philosopher, physicist, literary critic and quite simply one of the most remarkable minds of the ancient world.  She lived in the waning days of the Roman Empire, when the early Christians incited a war against science and philosophy.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz is fabulous as Hypatia.  It is said that Hypatia had the form of Aphrodite and the spirit of Plato;  Weisz is credible in her portrayal of Hypatia on both of these fronts.  Weisz takes us by the hand and shows us how Hypatia grappled with issues that would be hammered out by Copernicus, Keppler, Galileo and Einstein > 1,000 years later.<br /><br />Hypatia's story is a tragic one ~ mirrored by the fate of the library of Alexandria itself.  She lived in a time when friction rose between the separation of church and state as well as the animosity between science and religion.  Misogyny also reigned supreme.  A Christian mob eventually  destroyed the library and sent western civilization plunging into the Dark Ages.  The story of both Hypatia & the library is told in this film.<br /><br />Those who are moved by this film might be inspired to read [[ASIN:0345331354 Cosmos]], [[ASIN:0674437764 Hypatia of Alexandria (Revealing Antiquity , No 8)]] and [[ASIN:0970064586 Anita's Legacy]].

B001NLKWLW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The Secret Garden was one of my favourites growing up and I was a little afraid that this would not live up to the comparison.  It was a magical fairy tale of a novel.  It kept me interested although I found it got a little too far-fetched at the end, even for a fairy tale.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Driven by powerful urges to create a new musical paradigm, DEVO has once again hit pay dirt.    Great album  - some traditional DEVO sounding tunes, some not so \\"traditional\\" sounding.  A few - well most - are overtly political, but they always have been and that is ok.    The music and timing of this album have introduced a new generation to the sounds I grew up with.  It's good to have them back in action and sounding good.  Well worth the price.  I just wish they had embedded their videos into the CD,  they are great live performers as well as avant-garde video artists...
B004GBK09A|5.0|It's Kind of a Funny Story, is a very emotional comedy, constantly switching from comedy to drama and back again. It takes you deep into the minds of many teenage honor students who are pressured by society, parents, and the people around them to succeed in everything. As a teenage honor student it was easy to relate to the movie as I have thought more than once what it'd be like to get hit by a bus due to stress from school and life. So if you're a teenager I strongly suggest you watch this movie, it is aimed right at you and gives a great message for when you feel like the world is crashing down on you. As for adults and parents, you should watch it too so you know to support your kids and what NOT to do. I give the movie a 5 out of 5 because it is an original story and is very entertaining while sending a good message with a lot of laughs and a couple of tears. Buy, rent, watch, or ingest today!!!

1936594293|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a work of perfection.  Jane Austin really knows how to make the characters come alive and you experience the book as if you are the one telling the story.  You also get to see what life would have been like back then, you get to see and experience something you would not have otherwise experienced yourself.  I am sure it was not an easy task to write feelings for another person.  Unless you experience them yourself, how can you say it for another? The book kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next, and I truly did not want to put it down, until I had read it all. If you like history, romance, and a great story line then I would highly recommend this book.
B00005JLD4|4.0|Three little girls were snatched from their mothers' arms. Spirited 1,500 miles away and denied their very identity. The girls were forced to adapt to a strange new world. They will attempt the impossible and will endure a daring escape. A run from the authorities. An epic journey across an unforgiving landscape that will test their very will to survive. Their only resources are determination, ingenuity and each other. Their one hope, find the rabbit-proof fence that might just guide them home. It is a true story which makes it that much more touching. The actions in this movie remind me alot like those actions of those practicing Indigenous religions. Indigenous religions can be described as consisting of ethnic or regional religious customs under the umbrella of an organized religion. All of the hardship the girls had to go through reminded me alot of how it is practicing under a religion that is not free like it is in America. You have to go by certain rules and certain obsticles just to get to where you want to be. It was very touching to see the similarity. Another example that comes to mind that closely relates to Rabbit-Proof Fence is those who practice a Primal Religion. The two most popular terms in the present context are 'primal' and 'traditional,' They are embedded on their beliefs and they are not going to let anything stop them from what they believe in. Which reminds me of the three girls. They firmly believed in getting back to where they belonged and no matter what was going to try and stop them, they had their eyes on the prize. It is amazing to see the connection between this movie and the Indigenous Religion. Overall it was a really great movie. There was a great storyline and it was very touching, I was able to watch it with my little sister. I would recommend it.

0307588343|5.0|This book offers a rare insiders view inside the collapse of a Wall Street machine. Personally, I found this one of the better explanations of what went wrong in the GFC.     McDonald's own personal/professional back story as well as government policy and company history are provided to set the scene and help explain why the financial system was able to end up in such a mess. Don't get me wrong, this is no essay - it's also an enjoyable read too, as McDonald recounts stories and emotions along the journey.    McDonald and Robinson explain and reiterate basic investment concepts throughout the book making it easily accessible for the uninitiated as well as an interesting read for experienced investors.    While the book primarily deals with McDonald's and his colleagues own experiences and frustration at the financial crisis, the concepts of corporate responsibility, governance and risk management apply to many other situations for businesses around the world.     I would recommend this book to anyone in finance or business, investors (to help understand risk) or anyone who would appreciate an insight of how things can go right, and how they can go so wrong in the business and investment worlds.    The lessons learned in hindsight, from both McDonald and his colleagues, will be as relevant in years to come as they were when Lehman Bros collapsed.
0205313426|5.0|E.B. White, author of Charlotte's Web, was introduced to The Elements of Style when he was a student at Cornell. It was the required text for English 8, a course taught by the author and printer of the book, William Strunk Jr. Strunk called it \\"the little book,\\" an apt label for a book of forty three pages.<br /><br />Thirty-eight years later, around 1957, Macmillan asked White to revise the little book for publication. This was a good move. Now, after fifty four more years, Strunk & White's book is still one of the best selling writing guides on the market. There's a fourth edition, a fiftieth anniversary edition, even an illustrated edition. I suspect that as long as there are writers and publishers, there will be more editions. The New York Times says that, \\"It's as timeless as a book can be in our age of volubility.\\"<br /><br />I bought my first copy of The Elements of Style in 1995. It was required reading for my college art history course. Though I skimmed through it and recognized some merit, I wasn't interested in writing and sold it back at the end of the semester. Years later, I bought another copy which I read at least once a year. If there is anything good about my writing, I owe it to this book and one other.<br /><br />My copy is quite marked. Some highlights have so faded that I've had to highlight them again. As I completed my annual reading last week, I realized how much difference there is between highlighting a passage and learning it. If I could just remember the advice in those marked passages half the time, I would be on my way to clear writing. Anyway, here are some of my favorite excerpts:<br /><br />\\"Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.\\"<br /><br />\\"Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, noncommittal language.\\"<br /><br />\\"The beginner should approach style warily, realizing that it is himself he is approaching, no other; and he should begin by turning resolutely away from all devices that are popularly believed to indicate style--all mannerisms, tricks, adornments. The approach to style is by way of plainness, simplicity, orderliness, sincerity.\\"<br /><br />\\"Writing good standard English is no cinch, and before you have managed it you will have encountered enough rough country to satisfy even the most adventurous spirit.\\"ne, but that every word tell.\\"<br /><br />\\"Make definite assertions.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Personally my whole family loved this movie, we laughed so hard, the weasel stole the show. By the way I have a big family, I have a son 28, twin boys 24, a son 22, a daughter 21, and a daughter 5. And the older kids have wives, and husband. I am 47 and my husband 51. Then their is also the grandkids, so when I say it is a movie for all ages, I know what I'm talking about. We don't try to pick it apart and analize it, we just watch it for what it is a GREAT MOVIE!!!AND I say it is about time that they started making movies that we can watch with the kids, Todays teens and young adults don't think it's a good movie unless its filled with vulgarity and lots of nudity and sex. So now when a good FAMILY movie comes along they don't like it. And my husband and I have also discussed the fact that even these type movies that are supposed to be for kids are all filled with hints, and lots (not sure how it is spelled so forgive me) IN_U_IN_DO and unless your very dumb, you get it. Most kids don't get it, but Adults should. We figure they do it so that the movies WILL \\"APPEAL\\" to all ages,thus selling more movies. And I have to admit, it really does make the movie funnier to the adults watching. But I still think we need more movies like this. I own almost all of the Shrek movies, which I bought on Amazon. I just love them and I am one of those who are sad that it has come to an end. I just hope they have another Ice Age coming, I would hate to see it also end. I would love to see this crazy bunch (family) raise the baby that Ellie gaves birth to in this movie. I REALLY hope that this is not the last one. By the way I bought the Shrek movies and the Ice Age movies for me and my husband because WE just love them, and we love that we can share something that we truely love with our kids and grandkids, and it brings us closer!Which is worth the cost of all these movies and more!!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I waited so impatiently for this book as did many others! Well, I wasn't disappointed! It was honestly nothing like I thought it would be; it was so much MORE! I was saddened by Mac's pain at the beginning and lived every moment and feeling with her. Spoilers*: I loved her journey through the mirror in the white mansion. Everything there was completely unexpected and kept me constantly on edge*. It was a constant roller coaster ride as new feelings and ideas and information kept coming at her while she was trying to figure out who she was and where she fit in. This book kept me riveted as I followed her in her journey of discovery for all the answers she wanted. Granted, she didn't get them all. Some questions weren't answered but I, for one, am okay with that.  I do know I will enjoy anything else that Karen has to write and go into each book with the joy of discovery. I like the twists and turns in her worlds, never knowing where they will take me. That is what makes it such a great read. There is never a dull moment!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|To me, this was a fun and funny movie to watch. It's really funny if you look at some of the little details in it. There's random stuff you won't notice unless you really watch it.Yes, it was silly, but that was the point. Even the story line was silly! If you watched this thinking that it wasn't then you're crazy to begin with.     I read some of the reviews and I think some of them are a little ridiculous! Sure, they were scanning pictures of their rears. So what! Everyone has one. You see rears all the time on Spongebob and no one one has complained about that. If you're worried your kids are going to see something bad that might rot their little minds, they're not. And for the lady who won't let their 14 year old watch it, you're senile and obviously haven't gone to public schools.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|Love this movie...couldn't wait to receive the dvd and wasn't disappointed. Twilight will always be my favorite because it was the love story of Edward and Bella. Catherine Hardwick did a very good job with the amount of budget she had, plus she brought together the cast and that was good. New Moon was my least favorite book and was very disappointed in the movie. I felt that Chris Weitz could had done a better job but maybe it was the script that he had to work with. He did have a much bigger budget. Italy was very good but the movie lacked something. Even the vampires coloring was off and wigs were terrible. Eclipse was great. David Spade did a very good job but he had a very good budget so it should have been good. The only thing I felt that he left on the cutting room floor that should have been included was the scene were Edward told Bella to lock her window. That one scene showed more of their relationship, how Edward was much more in love with her than Jacob who just forced himself on her even if she was saying No. I love the commentary section of the dvd. It is very informative and humorist. Am looking forward to the final two movies. I think they may be the best of all from what we have seen. Bill Conlon is doing a great job with Bella and Edward. That is the reason people were drawn into this sage...the love story. I do feel they could leave out the book of Jacob. It was very boring in the book. I loved Breaking Dawn but that part was a little too much. Let's see running around the Cullen house...oh yes that is exciting.

0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is a fantastic romantic entanglement with the kind of push and pull that will have readers sitting on the edge of their seats in great anticipation.  A story built on the foundation of a fabulous cast of characters, it is a compelling story of friendship and love.<br /><br />Angst-ridden at times, it was neither too schmoopy nor too rigid, which made me one happy girl. Quite the delicious combination of emotion and tension the bumps teens often encounter as they navigate their relationships are put on full display in a deftly plotted and characterized story.  I'll add, major props go out to Perkins for making this story realistic and relatable.  It was not filled with copious amounts of over-sexed teens looking to get into each other's pants.  There weren't a bunch of over-privileged snotty aristobrats positioning for power either it was just a great old fashioned love story with depth of character and interesting plots.<br /><br />While romance is the name of this game one of the most compelling elements of the story is the vehicle by which Anna and St. Clair get there.  The focus on the varying forms of friendship and the scenarios that test the various bonds each maintain strengthens the overall progression of their love story.  Of course, the most important being Anna and St. Clair's relationship building from platonic to more.  But, don't stop the presses yet because there is just so much more.  Through this progression there is much interaction with their other friends, potential lovers and current significant others.<br /><br />This is where the angsty parts come in and oh boy do I love me some angst!  BUT only when it's well done. Have I mentioned that it's well done here?  Because, Perkins builds an excellent wealth of tension both emotional and physical.  Yea, totally rockin' my socks off. Like making my stomach drop and getting me all jittery.  It wasn't the least bit contrived, overwrought, or unnecessary though it was just fabulousness.<br /><br />Another part of what drives the awesomeness is the extraordinary cast of characters.  Anna and St. Clair are surrounded by a diverse group of friends and family.  I got the best chuckle out of the Nicholas Sparks knock off that is Anna's father.  He's every cliched -- filled to the brim with fake tanning product and cable-knit sweaters. It was tremendously enjoyable.  However, while Anna's father was annoying to her for some relatively entertaining and superficial reasons there was also depth to their relationship.  Issues of abandonment were prevalent.  Having said that, I'll add that no one's daddy issues were more complex (and heartbreaking) than St. Clair's.  His father was a bastard with a capital B!  Domineering to the point of emotional abuse it was hard to watch this poor sweet boy take the brunt of that negativity.  Thankfully, their mutual father issues provided another reason for Anna and St. Clair to bond.<br /><br />Also amongst the cast were the typical boarding school fare, the mean girl and the trouble-maker boy who wants what his arch-enemy (in this case St. Clair) has.  There is also the close circle of friends that surrounded St. Clair and welcomed Anna with open arms.  From the day of the new girls arrival Meredith took Anna under her wing and showed her the ropes.  Introducing her to Josh, Rashmi and ultimately St. Clair Meredith became her best girlfriend in Paris.  Of course, Anna left her US-based best girlfriend Bridgette at home to take care of the cinema worker crush she left behind.  It's in the latter relationship that a bit of that angst I love comes into play.  Oh, and there's a bit at play as a result of St. Clair's girlfriend Ellie's presence as well.  Yup, loads of great characters instigating lots of great story.<br /><br />Finally, it's from the story's subtle nuances that I drew the most connection to the characters.  Anna's love of the cinema, St. Clair's dedication to his mother, and the changes both undergoas a result of knowing each other all bound me to this endearing story.  I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing Paris for the first time through Anna's eyes.  I strongly encourage you enjoy it too by adding Anna and the French kiss to your must read list.to this endearing story.

I think the book was great but rather long (10,000 + pages). There  also a foreign movie out. The movie stick very close to the book.
0307272702|5.0|I've never given low-carb diets any consideration before as I thought my family history of heart disease would make them too risky, but after reading Gary's book I decided to try Atkins, and at the end of my first month I've lost 20 pounds.  This is the first time in my entire life I've lost weight that fast without any effort on my part except ignoring the carbohydrate-laden foods that used to be a staple of my diet.  I intend to stick with it.    The book was a good straightforward read, it nearly beat the argument into the ground (and then some) and was just the right length and intensity to break my allegiances to the low-fat paradigm of healthy diet.  I am very thankful for Gary's work and will go back to read Good Calories, Bad Calories for more insight.  It's already become a life-changing book for me.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I am writing this review to confirm that it does work as advertised in case you are still not sure this particular mini-port adapter does support HDMI connections to your high definition TV set, and at the same time sends the audio signal to the TV's speakers. You will need to go into System Preferences and Sound to enable the sound to output through the HDMI external connection. I believe the MacBook Pro needs to be one of the newer models that came out in 2010 and the 15\\" and 17\\" models are supported for sound but not the 13\\". I had no problem getting this to work the first time and it still works great.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Another great BBC production \\"Life\\" presented in Hd almost 9 hrs. a bargain   for this price. If you like watching nature films with good narration and  music you will like this one. Anyone who enjoyed BBC's planet earth will  equally like this BBC production. Enjoy!
B003INBNXO|5.0|Never in my life have I watched a subtitled film that I minded reading this much!  The story of the Master is simply amazing!  I watched this for the first time last week and already I want to see this once again. I can't say enough about Donnie Yen who portrays Ip Man. I have been a fan of Donnie's for a very long time, but I must say this is truly my favorite file he has been in thus far!  The fight scenes are outstanding. I read one other review and someone mentioned the sound quality is to low, and I do remember watching it an having to turn it up quite high, but other than this, for me, it is perfect in every other way!  A must watch for Martial Arts fans like myself.
B0040PYVTW|5.0|Wow...It feels like I turned the corner onto 1978 avenue, yet as I walk down the street all kinds of modern reminders jolt me back into the 2000s. Aloe Blacc is a beautiful marriage of classic, retro funk and modern day soul. A must for anyone who feels soul and funk in their veins.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|When I first heard of the show, I admit that I had little interest, but thanks to my two sisters who convinced me to watch, I AM COMPLETELY HOOKED!<br />The writing is simply outstanding! All of the actors and actresses are incredibly amazing!  Andy Whitfield who portrays, \\"Spartacus,\\" being the best in my opinion. I can't say enough about this series. Watch the first episode alone, and I'm pretty sure you may get hooked as well:)
B003L20IHE|5.0|Underated movie about a man and his sunken dreams when his younger brother dies in a car crash. Nuanced understated performance from the usually happy go lucky lead supported with a tight script and cast. Zac Efron is a real revelation as a serious and considered actor, and Augustus Prew is perfectly cast as a \\"kinda\\" alter ego to Charlie. Subtle moments of direction and photography from Burr Steers. Cool songs throughout underscore feeling in the viewer from the likes of Electric Owls, Ramones, Andrew Bird and Pink Mountaintops supported by a superb melodic score from Rolfe Kent. A magical, MAGICAL, allegory comparing the sailing setting against Charlie's home setting as a metaphor for life, dreams and the choices we must ultimately make. Bought the US release of the DVD weeks ago - gets even better with more viewings and Bluray on order for its imminent release in the UK next week - my best of 2010! Seriously...buy it!!!
B00428ZRFE|4.0|This is in constant play on my music player! Gets me through the day at work and good workout songs!!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|There are many great pictures nominated for best picture, but Secretariat is the one overlooked for it is the BEST picture of the year.  Diane Lane deserves a best actress nomination.  This is an amazing movie re-living an amazing story & time in American history.  Every family should watch this movie!
B0033G9OFA|3.0|as a huge doors fan like everyone else, i was so into the documentary of \\"when your strange\\" when i saw it on television just a few weeks ago and then i saw that there was an accompaning CD to this documentary. based on loving the documentary i bought it as well as the CD, however.... my negative response is on not the poetry or the music itself of course, but the use of johnny depp?<br /><br />i thought he worked as a voice over in the documentary but i was totally put off by him being used on this CD to recite morrison's poetry? didn't morrison himself record his poetry and i'm thinking there was awhile back a CD that did indeed have morrison reading his poetry on it? i'm sure i'm not mistaken on this account.<br /><br />just don't think they should have used depp or anyone for that matter to read and vocalize morrisons' poetry. if they had used val kilmer it would have been even worse!<br /><br />so the CD is great with the music and the poetry, but if you have all the other Doors Cd's and/or greatest hits and believe in morrisons' talent as a poet, i think you might be disappointed to know it's not morrison reciting the poetry.<br /><br />so that's is my only negative thoughts on this CD!
0891419063|5.0|As with many reviewers, watching the mini-series The Pacific got me interested in this book, along with Helmet for My Pillow (Robert Leckie). It's always interesting to see how faithful a film is to a book. In this case, the Pacific was very, very true to the book. Author E.B. Sledge (Sledgehammer) was able to keep a diary of his experiences and published it in 1981. Because the mini series used this and Helmet for My Pillow as part of the foundation of the story, the two books have been often compared to one another. The authors are very different people, the styles naturally differ. Sledge is much more matter of fact and those facts are gut wrenching. He also wrote his tale long after the war, his narrative style is straight at you, but almost detached. Leckie is far more poetic with purple phrases and imagery. The experiences of both Marines were the same - horrific and brutal. To put it in context, those who got the `million dollar wound\\" were considered lucky. Their war was over, at least physically.<br /><br />Sledge writes of Boot Camp, battle, R&R, more training, more battle, attrition. It's hard to comprehend numbers such as being one of 26 survivors out of 1,500 men. Rain, heat, mud, hunger, anger, fear, bone weary fatigue and the ever present stench of dead, decaying bodies - how do you go on? Only the training and bonds between the men enable them to take the next muddy step, wipe maggots off of each other and kill others.<br /><br />This is not a book for the faint of heart. It does not glorify war; on the contrary, it shows wars waste, carnage and denigration of the human spirit. The only good to come from war are the bonds formed amongst those who fought, who accepted the burden for others who did not and could never understand. As Sledge points out, if a country is worth living in, then it's worth dying for. With privilege goes responsibility\\". With The Old Breed shows that and much more. An excellent book, if there were a 10 star rating, it would get 10 of 10.
B002ZG974M|5.0|BABIES Documentary is a must see for everyone.  It compares the raising of a child from birth to 1 year in 4 different countries...US, Japan, Africa,and Mongolia.  The US and Japanese upbringings were similar and Mongolia not too different, aside from the fact that the family was always magrating with the herd and setting up their tent home in different places. The African baby's upbringing was shocking to me as an American, but the baby seemed to thrive in what I wouldn't consider a healthy environment.  The bottom line of the video...there is no right or wrong way to raise a child...as long as love and care are involved.
B0040JHXTS|5.0|This box set is amazing.  The Promise documentary is the best I have ever seen.  Darkness is such an amazing album and it was great to hear the stories behind those songs.  And the concert footage is classic.  Bruce never fails to impress and this collection of great songs and incredible footage does not disappoint.  I know Bruce and Jon Landau were closely knit to this project.  You can see their stamp of approval all over it.  I think now either The River or Nebraska deserve the same treatment.  For me The River and Nebraska are my two all time favs.  I guess thats when I first discovered Springsteen and I still love rediscovering those great songs.  The album Nebraska set the tone for what would be later identified as Americana music.  Bruce sets a pretty high standard and I think Columbia should reissue The Lost Masters, which was a massive amount of cds with out takes from that era.  Its almost impossible to find that box set anymore.  So tell me what are your thoughts on which Springsteen album deserves the next special treatment?
0375507256|5.0|If you love to read for enjoyment and part of that enjoyment is an appreciation for excellent writing Cloud Atlas is highly recommended.  Marveling at how well Mitchell changes from one voice and setting to the next in these tied together tales is only distracting for a moment before you are sucked in to the story again. For true lovers of the wonder of the written word and plain old good story telling, reading Cloud Atlas is imperative.
0545123275|5.0|So, I just read this book awhile back, and it was AMAZING. Its captivating from the first page to the last. I had heard about this book many times before, but didn't know if it was gonna be any good, but I was so WRONG. Glad I decided to pick it up. It'll take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Grace is such a likeable character too. The 2nd book has a cliffhanger ending, but I CANNOT wait until the 3rd book is released! PICK THIS BOOK UP NOW. :D
0811870413|5.0|Being essentially lazy, I seldom write an Amazon review.  It feels a lot like homework, and nobody likes homework, right?  Still, I occasionally discover a book or a product that so exceeds my expectations that I feel a duty to share my good fortune with my fellow consumers.  Chad Robertson's \\"Tartine Bread\\" is one of those discoveries.    Robertson's book contains an important ingredient that other bread books lack: detail.  For example, in her book \\"The Italian Baker,\\" Carol Field provides recipes for dozens of Italian breads.  I have enjoyed the book, but each recipe is more of a rough guide than a detailed road map.  She uses instructions such as \\"Make a big round shape of it [the dough] by just folding and tucking the edges under a bit.\\"  She tries to describe the state of dough development using words like \\"velvety\\" and \\"moist.\\"  The book contains a few line drawings but no photographs.  By contrast, Robertson's book contains detailed instructions together with hundreds of photographs leaving no doubt what the developing dough should look like at each stage of the process.    The photographs and Robertson's autobiographical tale make \\"Tartine Bread\\" a joy to read.  Most important, the bread I've produced following Robertson's instructions has been wonderful: a cracklin' crispy crust, soft chewy crumb, faint aromas of hazelnut and chocolate (I have no idea why), and beautiful colors ranging from creamy white to almost black.  I have shared this bread with just two friends so far.  Both have now placed orders for the book and for the dutch oven combo that Robertson recommends.     I have seen some concern that this book contains too few recipes.  My advice: don't worry about it.  If this book does nothing more than teach you to bake the \\"Basic Country Bread,\\" it will be well worth the price.     I am unsure about the propriety of criticizing a review written by another Amazon user, but I cannot resist taking E. Hanner  to task for his November 10, 2010 misleading critique, \\"Tartine -- choose another book.\\"  Hanner finds fault in Robertson's explanation of baker's percentages, saying: \\"Robertson ... attempts to de-mystify bakers math so you learn to `think like a baker.'  Then his representation of the recipe or formula is in my opinion very non standard and confusing.\\"  In fact, Robertson's explanation of the baker's percentage is entirely correct.  (See, Harold McGee, \\"On Food and Cooking\\" (New York: Scribner, 2004), p. 527 and Michael Ruhlman, \\"Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking\\" (New York: Scribner, 2009), p. 5.)  Hanner seems unhappy that the components in a baker's percentage add up to more 100%.  That, however, is why it's called a \\"baker's percentage\\" and not a \\"mathematician's percentage.\\"  Hanner also seems to misunderstand that the flour in the leaven is included in the percentage of leaven rather than the percentage of dough flour.    Finally, Hanner expresses concern for our safety, complaining that \\"[t]he concept of baking in a cast iron combo cooker is in my opinion, an accident waiting to happen.\\"  Even the most humble home cook handles hot pans regularly.  We're not children, for crying out loud.    Hanner claims that his critique is not mean spirited, but it's hard to believe anything else.  Robertson has written a wonderful book that succeeds (where other bread books have failed) in providing a detailed, illustrated path to better bread building.
B003INBOEM|1.0|Returned first dvd because movie kept freezing after previews. Exchange for new dvd thru amazon was easy and convenient. Unfortunately 2nd dvd had same problem. Only then, did I notice upon going to Ip Man dvd webpage that the dvd doesn't work on Panasonic and Sylvania blue ray players - there is a notice. So I have no idea how the movie is, although it sounds great. So disappointed. Not sure if I can return opened second dvd.
0312370849|5.0|I found this story to be haunting, thought-provoking, and beautiful. Not to mention a page-turner once you get into it a bit. The story has stayed with me, and I have shared this book with many of my friends and family.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is a real treat!  I got this so fast after ordering.  This seller is wonderful and I would definitely purchase from him again.
B00338QELU|3.0|It's been a little while since I've read this novel and since I can't really remember a lot about it, should tell you that it's somewhat unremarkable.  I remember it being a decent read, but nothing to write home about.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book was simply AWESOME. The characters were well-developed, the conflict was intriguing, the plot was intense, and the romance was well-reasoned. Nothing weird happened, because you once it happened, your sub-conscious mind was like, \\"well of that would happen,\\" and then you'd just love the book even more. If you're a guy, then yes this book is still for you. I'm a teenage guy, and I loved this book!! (look at the first sentence of this review) and also it mixed many human weaknesses and prejudices well into the story and made this book even more of a page turner. All in all, 5 STARS!!!!
B001NLKT60|4.0|Although a bit far-fetched at times, I found this novel the best in the series due to its pace and the focus on Lisbeth Salander's character and back story, which is the real reason for reading the series in the first place.
B00474IVGA|3.0|When I purchased this CD I thought it contained the original soundtrack from the movie.I mainly wanted to hear the song sung by Garret and Leighton,\\"Give in to me\\". However on the CD it was sung by Faith Hill. I was totally disappointed. Other songs by Garrett Hedlund were not on it also.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|This novel is the necessary ending to the series and it does just that - wraps everything up with a nice bow on it.  Glad to be finished.  It's been a long journey and a lot of coffee references.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I gifted this to my hubby on our anniversary. Thia is his favorite show.The enhanced audio & video gives it a higher score. Picture quality is too good. And the order arrived a day earlier than estimated date.Thank you amazon. :)
B0011UJMK2|5.0|A murder mystery based on true events in the Soviet Union.  If you're interested in Cold War history and the Soviet Union and love a good thriller / murder mystery, this novel will not disappoint.  The twist is a little predictable, but it's easy to look past that as the rest of the story is so entertaining.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|When you see the movie then my title should make sense. When the movie title is explained in the movie then it should all make sense. I really enjoyed this movie. Yaniv Schulman is hot!
B0015DROBO|3.0|This is a decent read, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  Based on how long it has been a bestseller, I suppose I was expecting more.  Overall, this novel, and the rest of the series, are decent reads, but there were numerous times I was just ready to be done with them.  Lisbeth Salander's character is the one saving grace and is a worthy justification for reading the series.
B003LLPFBE|5.0|If you liked The World is Flat and anything by Malcolm Gladwell, this is the perfect book for you, written before any of these others.
B003TML0VO|5.0|I love this CD! I always Loved Santana and this Cd is with alot of others, and its Great! I would recommend this Cd to Fans of Santana He rocks with so many great artists.
0811870413|5.0|This is the first Amazon review I have written, but I had to write after making my first batch of bread yesterday. It was absolutely perfect, definitely right up there with the best bread I've ever bought. I am not an experienced baker and I found the instructions and the bread making process not only interesting to read, but easy to follow. The famous Tartine country bread is the main recipe in the book and it is one that anyone could follow with amazing results. This was the first time I made a starter and it was no problem. Once that is done, Chad takes you through the entire bread making process and provides explanations for each step. There are also options for making the lengthy bread making process work for your schedule.     Best of all, the bread that I made came out looking and tasting exactly like the Tartine bread. It had the perfect crunchy crust with the chewy, airy center and amazing flavor. I have shared it with my family and they cannot believe that I made it. I will be making this bread at least once a week.    I encourage anyone interested in making great artisan bread at home to give this book a try. The only special equipment needed is a kitchen scale. While the book talks about cooking the bread in a cast iron combo cooker, I used an enameled cast iron Le Creuset pot with a lid and it worked great.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|Hy..! This is one of the most beautiful watches that i have.!Is perfect and gorgeous.! Beware customers from UK (& Europe): i was charged by ParcelForce with 30£ more.If you have items that have value more then 40£ and are not present/gift, then... they will charge you.
B003Q6D25U|3.0|The first paranormal activity blew me away...it was intriguing, creepy as hell, and believable. The Prequel...Not so much. Paranormal activity 2 has its flaws. First of all the setting, felt like a rerun of MTV'S \\"The Hills.\\" Not enough confined space, opposed to the first one. Secondly, the first forty five minutes or so is a total drag, many boring scenes. There wasn't enough questioning the demonic force, or researching it to be known even after strange events start happening. The characters didn't seem believable, until the second act of the film...where it actually picks up and isn't such a total bore fest! I thought the concept of the movie was great, just not enough action, and a little too much humor between the characters for my tastes. Just like the Quija board scene, that would have been creepy if it had the affect the first one did. The girl wasn't even acknowledging that her baby brothers name was being spelled out, and was cracking jokes about the word vagina. I blame the writers for that though. There are however some creepy scenes towards the end of the film, nothing spectacular although. More or less, the same as the first in that sense. This one definitely did not mount the horror, or the dread,  night after night, leading up to the occurrences like the first one did. The best part in the movie is the ending with Katie, have no complaints about that. And what about the dog? Never did find out if it was okay, after the attack by the demon...oh well, too many loose ends in this underrated prequel. Hope the film makers go back to the basics with the third, and make it a noteworthy sequel...  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY *** STARS OUT OF FIVE. Last thoughts?...Okay, but just mediocre.
B003N5VOUO|4.0|The writeup on the cover is somewhat misleading. This movie is about tolerance and intolerance, both between faiths and cultures and within those faiths (well, within Islam). No one is spared - Muslims, Christians, Hindus - but the treatment is also balanced. It's a feel-good movie, but there's also a dose of tragedy, from 9/11 and its results.<br /><br />Khan is a moderate Muslim with Asperger's Syndrome. He's a genius at repairing things, but is frightened of loud sounds and the color yellow, and has trouble expressing his feelings, although he can fall in love.<br /><br />The movie is structured so that we find out gradually why he's on his trip across America. This was well done, and keeps us waiting to find out more. We are shown his childhood and how his condition affects him. He takes things literally, always tells the truth, and has a seemingly eidetic memory, and this is a source of humor throughout the movie.<br /><br />He falls for a Hindu woman and, to the chagrin of his \\"more devout\\" brother, marries her. But he is no less devout, carrying out his required prayer times no matter where he happens to be. He has been taught by his mother that there are only two kinds of people - those who do good, and those who do evil. This is how he sees the world.<br /><br />We are shown the tragic consequences of 9/11, leading to suspicion and hatred towards Muslims. This was a bit heavy-handed, as the reality in the States was very different from what would be expected in the rest of the world, considering the video of Muslim children laughing and cheering the death and destruction of 9/11, an image of demented hatred. For example, the movie only shows the resulting bigotry, but not the concerted efforts throughout the country to show kindness and acceptance to Muslims post-9/11, even towns neighborhoods offering free meals to them. There is a call for moderate Muslims to be proud of their faith, showing educated women once again proud to wear their hijab. And there is a call to root out the jihadist elements from within Islam.<br /><br />In the movie, their business falters because of the Khan name attached to it.

1556438850|4.0|Amazing.  This is a great book, a complete starting point for anyone who wants to teach yoga.  It has lots of poses and pose break-downs with charts and explainations for the whole picture when running a yoga studio, or being a group fitness instructor teaching a yoga format.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This book jumped off the shelf at me at my local library. Just look at that orange cover! I find as I read it that I am impressed by the simplicity of Achor's suggestions and the range of research to support each one.    The anecdotes and humor make this book easy and fun to read. I fully enjoy the description of the fascinating psychological research that led Achor to develop his seven principles. This book is very much based in research, with example after example of when these seven principles have shown themselves to be true.    The principles themselves I find very believable, I can imagine them working for me. I suppose the research and anecdotes help on that front, so they are doing their job. I also imagine it will be easy to implement the seven principles. I use the future tense here because I am not quite done reading the book (currently on principle #5), although I have begun using some of Achor's knowledge, and I was very happy to take the online quiz another reviewer mentioned. I, too, found it to be quite accurate and worth my time. And while I imagine it may be difficult to work my character strength of forgiveness and mercy into my daily life, love of learning and curiosity should be easier.    The last thing I want to say is that I am not a high-powered business executive, and I believe this is an important point. It is obvious that the majority of Achor's audiences at his speaking engagements are just this, and of course, that's fine. But I believe that this book has something of value for everyone, and as a mom and teacher, I can imagine myself as a manager of my home and my classroom and use Achor's work in a way that benefits myself and those around me.
0316019984|4.0|4 y.o. grandson spent 1 1/2 hrs. looking through this book after he opened his present.  It is attractive, eye-catching with bright colors.  Intricate pop ups required a gentle hand from an adult.  Will have to see how durable this is.  Definately is a winner with my grandson who is a big fan of Super Heroes!
B003O86FMW|2.0|I'm going to put the reviews of all 3 books together because I'd like people to know what they are getting into by picking up the first book. Had I known it myself, I wouldn't have purchased The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Book 1 was great. It was amazing. I loved the writing, the creativity, the plot. I think it would be a good idea to ready food and drinks by the bed before diving into the book because really, the book was unputdownable. Oh, and tissue papers as well, as the book constantly moved me to tears.<br /><br />[SPOILERS]<br /><br />However, I was not aware of the fact that by reading The Hunger Games, I was signing myself up to sort-of a romance novel, which was a genre I had absolutely zero interest in reading. Worse, it was another girl-can't-decide-which-boy-she-loves-more-so-she-leads-them-on-and-claims-them-both romance novel.<br /><br />The love triangle thing was sudden and not entirely believable, but the majority of the book was focused on life in District 12, hunting, and the actual Hunger Games, which equaled lots of actions, which was what I signed up for, so I had a great time reading Book 1 (minus the romance).<br /><br />I should have seen this coming, but silly me held on to the hope that maybe the love triangle thing wouldn't be so prominent in Book 2. But I was wrong. Very wrong. While I could barely part with my Kindle when I was devoting Book 1 in one sitting, Book 2 could barely hold my attention. Whenever the romance got too unbearable, I found myself spacing out and wanting to fall asleep, which was quite often. I can't say I enjoyed reading Book 2.<br /><br />By the time I finished Book 2, I had lost most of my interest in the story, not only because of the romance, but here and there, things just... happened. Some of these things were boring, some didn't make sense. Sure, the second Games was great, although not as good as the first one. And I did shed tears once. But comparing to Book 1, Book 2 did not have whatever it was that captivated me and made me finish reading Book 1 in one sitting like there was no tomorrow.<br /><br />I purchased Book 3 simply because I wanted to finish what I started. I wanted to know how the story ended, although I took so little pleasure in reading it that I skimmed quite some passages. If I thought Book 2 was worse than Book 1, Book 3 was a disaster. I found myself reading things a mentally unstable Katniss did and thought about, which, while I was sure added to the character's depth or something, not what I signed up for nor cared to read about. I wanted actions, which did not happen often in Book 3, and when they did happen, not entirely convincing or nearly powerful enough.<br /><br />With the almighty Capitol so easy to penetrate and fall, it was like watching a badly made movie where they tried to squeeze in a lot of special effects but failed to edit out the green screen entirely. It was like watching a good story went to waste.<br /><br />Katniss reminded me of Bella from Twilight. And I dislike both characters. But at the very least, Twilight had a good ending which I kept going back to re-read over and over again, while Mockingjay's felt like... failure could be too harsh a word, so I'd say unaccomplished instead. I have no desire to re-read these books at all.<br /><br />Suzanne is, no doubt, a gifted author, and readers who enjoy romance and love triangles are highly likely to love these books. But for readers who want pure actions and/or don't care so much for those female characters who can't decide which boy she wants to keep, think twice before hitting the buy button.tivated me and made me finish reading Book 1 in one sitting like there was no tomorrow.<br /><br />I purchased Book 3 simply because I wanted to finish what I started.

B0014U4X3U|5.0|Aside from getting a great collection of fine literature, you get delightful illustrations!  What more could a Jane Austen reader want?  Admittedly, the illustrations are a bit hard to appreciate entirely due to their rendering on the Kindle, but the mere fact that they exist makes this book above-average.  I'd recommend this to Austen fans and initiates alike!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm going to put the reviews of all 3 books together because I'd like people to know what they are getting into by picking up the first book. Had I known it myself, I wouldn't have purchased The Hunger Games.    Book 1 was great. It was amazing. I loved the writing, the creativity, the plot. I think it would be a good idea to ready food and drinks by the bed before diving into the book because really, the book was unputdownable. Oh, and tissue papers as well, as the book constantly moved me to tears.    [SPOILERS]    However, I was not aware of the fact that by reading The Hunger Games, I was signing myself up to a sort-of romance novel, which was a genre I had absolutely zero interest in reading. Worse, it was another girl-can't-decide-which-boy-she-loves-more-so-she-leads-them-on-and-claims-them-both romance novel.    The love triangle thing was sudden and not entirely believable, but the majority of the book was focused on life in District 12, hunting, and the actual Hunger Games, which equaled lots of actions, which was what I signed up for, so I had a great time reading Book 1 (minus the romance).    I should have seen this coming, but silly me held on to the hope that maybe the love triangle thing wouldn't be so prominent in Book 2. But I was wrong. Very wrong. While I could barely part with my Kindle when I was devoting Book 1 in one sitting, Book 2 could barely hold my attention. Whenever the romance got too unbearable, I found myself spacing out and wanting to fall asleep, which was quite often. I can't say I enjoyed reading Book 2.    By the time I finished Book 2, I had lost most of my interest in the story, not only because of the romance, but here and there, things just... happened. Some of these things were boring, some didn't make sense. Sure, the second Games was great, although not as good as the first one. And I did shed tears once. But comparing to Book 1, Book 2 did not have whatever it was that captivated me and made me finish reading Book 1 inone sitting like there was no tomorrow.

B0034G4P7Q|5.0|The Social Network is a 2010 film directed by David Fincher ([[ASIN:B001BPQT8A Seven]], [[ASIN:B0007DFJ0G Fight Club]]), penned by Aaron Sorkin based on a book called [[ASIN:0307740986 The Accidental Billionaires]], and it stars a tremendously deep cast of Hollywood's finest young up-and-comers.  The Social Network tells the origins story of Facebook; as appropriate and timely a social commentary as there could be, and it just so happens to have been made into a story that provides pinpoint Hollywood courtroom-like drama as well as the slimy business ethics we sometimes regretfully behold as a culture.  Many may think that Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed in a negative light here, but certainly not among many of the people I've known.  He is the cutthroat enraged nerd that many can not only identify with but possibly even admire.  I went to graduate school and worked right up the street from where Facebook began its enormous growth and influence, and all around the same time it happened.  I know a Hollywood production when I see one and I certainly know Boston enough to see a fair balance between the two very different realms.  I of course mean that as an additional compliment to the many deserving accolades The Social Network has already received, including 8 Oscars Nominations and 6 Golden Globe nominations with 4 wins, including Best Picture - Drama.<br /><br />It is 2003 at Harvard University and Mark (Jesse Eisenberg) suffers a horrible break-up with his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara).  He begins a blog that coldly insults her and then soon after creates the website Facesmash, which draws the attention of several fellow Harvard students and internet entrepreneurs who approach him with an idea for a social networking site.  From there Mark begins creating his own website called thefacebook.  Along his journey he draws the ire of his former business partners, eventually sticks it to his best friend and CFO Eduardo (Andrew Garfield, in what is likely the film's greatest performance), and even teams up with Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the co-founder of Napster among other successful internet ventures.  The narrative certainly makes the story far too slick and far too fun to seem like real life, and the real-life people it portrays referring to their real lives as boring by comparison doesn't help the movie's claim toward authenticity either, but I'm willing to forgive it for that because this movie has too many other things to appreciate.  And really, who wants to watch a bunch of homely computer geeks eat pizza and sit in front of their monitors for two hours?<br /><br />Sorkin's screenplay is certainly the film's greatest strength but David Fincher may deserve just as much praise for putting it all together.  The performances are outstanding by almost everyone, but especially Eisenberg and Garfield.  The film's audio and visuals are top of the line and no doubt deserving of their praise, while the soundtrack is in perfect tune with what appears to be a less stylized but more controlled and mature Fincher.  This is great filmmaking but for those who don't appreciate drama like this or for those who despise the very existence of Facebook, it's probably best to just watch the movie win Best Picture and be bitter about it.  It isn't my favorite movie of the year but it is close, and I would pick it to win the year's biggest award.lm's greatest performance), and even teams up with Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the co-founder of Napster among other successful internet ventures.

0920668372|1.0|I got this book for my two year old girl.  The images of the Mom sneaking in rocking the baby no matter what size he was scared her.  She is never scared by books but she started to cry.  I found the images creepy as well.  A Mom sneaking and rocking her teenage son-Disturbing.  I DO NOT recommend this book.  There are many better Love books.  Try \\"You are my I Love You\\".
B003ES61EE|2.0|I'm boggled at all the 4 and 5 star reviews on this, having used other good lenses brushes, this one really falls flat. First, there's no instructions whatsoever included, so it's a mystery as to what the non-brush felt end is even designed to do. The idea of using it on a lens is to me absurd, all it takes is a single speck of dust getting between the felt and the glass and you have a pretty good chance of doing damage to your lens. Just for the heck of it though, I did try getting rid of a smudge or two on the UV filters I use on some lenses. All it did was smear the smudge around and make it bigger. Likewise for trying to use it on the LCD screen on the back of the camera. So not sure what the heck this thing is intended to do, but getting rid of smudges, it's pretty useless.<br /><br />The brush is adequate at best. You can certainly find similar brushes of better quality. This one tended to shed hairs more than most, and while it locked fairly well in the open position, it did not lock in the closed position well at all, and pulling it out of my bag, I often found it had slid open (causing additional damage to the brush and hairs inside my bad, not good.<br /><br />Overally, there's really not much I can recommend about this brush.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I liked this book and like other people I couldn't put it down.  I did have a few moments of reading where it reminded me of the kidnaping sensation newstory that happened a while back.  It really puts it into perspective.  I wish the author of this book would donate a portion of the funds to the care of that girl.  I haven't looked at the time-line for this book and that newstory but I hope the idea for this book wasn't inspired from that event.  It's a good read from a neat perspective.  It does get a bit monotonous reading the same type of comments from a 5 y/o kid they are redundant at times but great others.  This was the first book I bought on my kindle this xmas.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The movie was great. Given the overdone acting that is Christian Bale it still was worth watching, and even purchasing to watch again.<br /><br />We all know the sad event of this movie, but let's skip talking about it further.<br /><br />A wonderful ride through Gotham in the time that Joker was loose on the streets and this movie delivers that experience. I must admit my lack of interest for \\"super\\" hero movies but with the high reviews of this movie it was worth a try. I bought it hoping for excellence and that is what I received.<br /><br />There are some who wouldn't give this a good rating, but it is after all a movie and nobody can decide your taste. If you like the strange experience of seeing a wonderful performance of the Joker, an over-the-top Batman which was tolerable, and all the action you can image a comic book city is going to endure then you should certainly consider this movie as a purchase.
1439152780|3.0|I have enjoyed her past books.  I find that this novel was not my cup of tea.  It moved rather slowly and the story line was not one which made me want to continue reading.   It switched between current times and WW11.  Most books which I purchase I enjoy reading a second time; however, this is not one for a second read.
B00000IQV7|5.0|This movie turned out to be a sleeper-I didn't expect it to have so much depth.  When Robin Williams is \\"on\\" as an actor, he's one of the best in the business & this movie was another winner for him (in addition to Dead Poet's Society & Good Will Hunting).  I hadn't heard much about this movie before watching it and wrongly assumed that it would be one of Williams' slap-stick roles... it was nothing of the kind.  Extremely thought-provoking.  Being based on a true story, it was especially powerful & marvelous to see the main character beat the odds, especially for the common good which seems to be so rare these days.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|i have recently read the Hunger Games and a friend recommended the Maze Runner. the two are very much alike but plot wise i prefer the Maze Runner. amazing read. simply a must read.
0525951652|3.0|Follett launches into historical fiction again with this one, the first of the \\"Century\\" trilogy (which will apparently encompass the major events of the 20th century), set in and around the World War One era.    Not that this is a bad read, but, by Follett's fairly high standards, it really doesn't cut it. First up the novel is too long. I'm not saying that it should be cut in half or anything, but maybe editing some of the politics and wartime scenes would have moved the plot on in better fashion.     Having the listing of characters at the front of the book helped - normally I don't like the concept, but I guess in such a large book it isn't a bad idea. As for the characters themselves, well aside from the likeable Ethel who rises from the lower classes, the superior (and eminently destestable) Earl Fitzherbert, along with seperated lovers Walter and Maud, there aren't too many that are memorable.    I see previous reviews mention Follett's sex scenes. I'm no prude, but they really are cringeworthy at times, not only from the clunky mechanical descriptions of the events, but also by the depiction of all men as sex starved neanderthals looking to deflower their next virgin. Memo to the author - do these better next time or just leave them out entirely.     All up, not bad, but not one to rush out and get.
0307272702|5.0|Why We Get fat is an updated, simplified and condensed version of the book [[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health (Vintage)]].  Here Gary Taubes has made the information a lot more approachable and easy to digest.<br /><br />The key of Why We Get Fat is a challenge to the fundamental base assumption that our society has about how we put on and lose weight. Taubes debunks a lot of very commonly held beliefs and looks at the underlining science of the body and its relationship to food, calories and exercise.  The information is extremely well presented, slightly repetitive at times but that's forgivable as it continues to be engaging and informative every step of the way.<br /><br />Why We Get Fat isn't a diet book, it's a look at a philosophy of eating and weight management that can be used over a long period of time.  I've been following the advice in this book and have shaved off 12 pounds without going to the gym or starving myself.  Simply amazing.
0802136834|4.0|I love learning about this time period, so suffice to say, I really enjoyed this book. I loved all the details and descriptions. Her research is impeccable and meticulous. I did have to laugh when I read some reviews that said the book was really boring and it should have \\"included more dialogue and what the people were really thinking.\\" Perhaps these people missed the day in 3rd grade when you learned the difference between fiction and non-fiction? The same people wrote that they liked Phillipa Gregory's books much better. HELLO! Those are fiction! Yes, based on historical events, but fiction nonetheless.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|.... long live The Decemberists  I had to really dig deep to appreciate \\"Hazards of Love\\"...I did eventually come to love the album.  But this album was love at first listen. It was probably quite difficult for them to let go of the lyrical/intellectual complexity and \\"simplify\\" their music, but it seems to have retained the magical lyrical qualities that makes The Decemberists one of my favorite bands.
8185300534|5.0|Nisargadatta's brilliance is aptly conveyed in this work. However I would not recommend this book to someone who has not spent considerable time indulging in self-awareness practise. There are several other books that would gently introduce you to these concepts without actually 'disturbing' you outright.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Not much to say, it's probably been reviewed to death and you are wondering if this is going to be a spoiler.<br /><br />it's not your typical Bruce Willis movie, but then what is? humorous like Mr and Mrs Smith, but don't think i am comparing the two. two intirely different movies. I am just saying you like one you will probably like the other.<br /><br />four old CIA agents are targeted becuase they were in the wrong place at the wrong time and now someone wants them out of the way. bring in an aging russian agent and you have a geritol hit squad.<br /><br />funny at times. you still have to suspend beliefe most of the time.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I was never really intreged with foreign vampire flicks - well foreign flicks in general. I didn't watch this movie with subtitles, I watched the dubbed version and it didn't bother me. I like the movie a lot, it was annoying with the audio dubbed. It still had it's magic and I really enjoy this movie and I can't wait to see the remake.
0545123283|5.0|\\"Ok so bare with me on this one. I just shut this book and the tears still blur my vision as I'm typing this. I think my heart is breaking in a way that I never thought a book could do. I am going to try and keep this as objective as possible but emotions are running high and raw right now. Oh Maggie how amazing are you?!<br />When I read Shiver it left me wanting more. Now that I've read Linger I am left Needing more! At first glance Linger can be a bit confusing to follow. Maggie introduces a few new/ great characters in a way most authors wouldn't, by switching the narrative back and forth between 4 main characters. For a while it feels like you are trying to keep more than one story straight at a time, and while this would have never worked for most stories/authors, it works beautifully. It brings a level of depth and connection to the story that you just simply would have missed if she hadn't wrote it the way she did. My hat goes off to you Maggie Stiefvater. Bravo!<br />Sam and Grace in all their tragic love has never been more real. I laughed, I cried, I dreamed about the wolves...what more could you ask for? How about a super hot famous rocker trying to run from his past. He's tortured and damaged in a way that makes him a heartless bastard yet somehow you will still fall for him every time.<br />Buy it, rent it, borrow it, steal it if you have to, but Read It! You'll thank yourself later.\\"
B0042816YK|1.0|I was hoping the movie would be more entertaining than the book.  This movie is equally as horrible as the book.  If you're curious about the film, I would save your money and check it out from your local library.      The main character is shallow and self-absorbed.  The acting is horrible.  In this film, Julia Roberts has only two expressions, the blank stare and the blank stare with a cheesy smile.
B003INBOEM|5.0|I have seen this movie like 8 times and love it each time. I have always hated reading subtitles but did not mind it one bit when it came to IP. I HIGHLY recommend.

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|i gotta say this CPU is great but i cant notice the difference from my past phenom II 695, i guess im just not that much a hardcore user of the CPU.    one thing you should know, if you plan on buying this, buy another cooler!!!(air or water) because the stock fan might keep it somewhat cool, but it makes a LOT of noise specially if on load.    mine ranges from 3000 RPM to 6000 RPM (try that on an 80mm fan and compare noise)
B000FC1192|5.0|I have seen the movie so many times but the book beats it by a million! This book has a freaky plot but is a great general story. By far my fav!
B000089RV6|5.0|I was in 8th grade when this came out. It was mind blowing. Oh man it still is. Absolutely crankable 31 years later. For every teen out there that loves Nickelback and such put this on your turntable and have at it.  Make sure you girlfriend is ready for the power this will bring to the night! (just listen to the lyrics if you missed my drift).    Happy, incredible memories decades later. DO NOT LET our younger rock generation miss this.
B0015RWCVM|5.0|First I tried this CD at the library. I enjoyed the music and the performance to such an extent that I I made up my mind to have my own. Now listening to it is a part of my commuting routine.
B0002S947K|1.0|If you like Eric Clapton's brand of fake blues and rock, then this is for you.    One can picture LaMontagne hunched over his guitar, eyes clenched shut, with a forced look of pained intensity on his face, as he croaks out his trite, insipid lyrics.  Like Clapton.
B001V9LRTM|5.0|As noted in the comments to the review titled \\"Inexcusable DVD transfer\\", that review was written in 2002 about the original directors cut DVD which was released in 1997. If you look at the number of reviews of both both the new Blu-Ray set and the old 1997 set, you'll see that they have the same number of reviews as Amazon has unfortunately chosen to share the reviews among at least three different DVD sets. Note that you can also sort the reviews by \\"Newest First\\" and see the newer reviews (or go the last pages and read the old reviews).    I have not seen the Blu-Ray version yet but plan to purchase it as I am sure most everyone reading this already knows, this concert was a significant part of U.S. history. And for any who have not thought about it before, watch it from a technical standpoint with the multiple camera angles during the performances. As a guitar player, my only beef is that they sometimes focused too much on closeups of the performer when I would have rather had a wider angle so I could see their guitar work (especially Hendrix and Alvin Lee). Pretty amazing that they planned such extensive footage of of the event as many never even realized the historical significance of this concert until it actually happened.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|There is nothing really to debate when it comes to Star Wars, either you like them or you dislike them. I am glad these movies are going to be on blu ray and I hope they come in a really bad ass case just like Alien Anthology. I personally would like to see IV, V, and VI remade with better light saber duels and VII, VIII, and IX become movies in my life time. I would like to see Luke going to the dark side on the big screen instead of in comic book form. I would like to see Anakin Solo on the big screen as well!
B00433TO52|5.0|This is a great collection. I am someone that likes to have a  complete collection of things, so this really suited me. All in all, the best part is to be able to walk around with Shakespeare wherever I go. I've read and re-read Shakespeare for a long time. Still, I find him to be wonderful. His poetry has so much nuance that I am always finding something new and his plot devices have been used and re-used for centuries. This is why when I got my Kindle, I wanted to load Shakespeare up as quickly as possible.  This collection is great, it has everything, it is easy to navigate, and it's inexpensive. So I'm extremely pleased to have it.
0316098337|5.0|A friend from my book club said it was a \\"must read\\" and I agree.  It's all about the bond between the mother and son--and written from the seven-year old child's mind. How the author was able to capture the child's mind will  keep you spellbound.
0307272702|5.0|I have done the Atkins diet several years ago and bought the Atkins book, the Protein Power book and the Sugar Busters book.  This book is completely different. Taub really explains the science, history and socio economics of high carb vs. low carb eating.      I realized that when I was on this diet years ago I never was fully convinced that calories in didn't equal calories burned. At that time, I still watched calories while on a low carb diet, I restricted fats, still bought sour cream, mayonaise, salad dressing in the half fat versions.  I was too scared to do otherwise. As a result, I had some good results, but dropped the diet quickly.     Taub's arguments for this diet are well researched and defended and the reasons why the majority of \\"experts\\" choose to ignore the science are well explained. There is too much invested in the current diet and fitness industry and this philosophy is so opposite, it threatens to bring down a huge part of the food industry.     I also like how he explains that excersize is good for many things, but weight loss isn't one of them.  (how I cringe now when I see the weight loss reality shows and what they put the obese people through as far as working out for 8 hours a day) I actually started believing the argument against the great excersize myth about a year ago when there was a big article in Newsweek about how excersize does not affect weight loss. I realized then that it was all in the diet, but I still believed in calories in and calories out. Until I finally got it by reading this book.     2 weeks ago, after reading this,  I decided to put my faith into the correct way of doing the low carb diet. No matter what , I was going to follow it for a month, even if I wound up gaining weight at the end.  That meant full fat dressing, Full fat mayonaise and sour cream, not just eating skinless chicken breast and tuna for protein, eating meat, real eggs, etc.  I can say in 2 weeks, I lost weight and inches and feel better already.  I will be making a doctors appointment soon and will get cholesterol and blood pressure checked and hope to report positive results with that as well.     Well worth the read, especially if you've been down the low carb path before and didn't really \\"get it\\" the first time around.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Great begining! I'm sure the the sequels will be just as good or better!  The details are amazing it just seems that you're right there with Nicholas,Pernell,Sophie,Josh,and Scatty! AMAZING!!!
B0037KMHRY|4.0|The album arrived in a very timely manner with great packaging.   Now for what I think of the album... I like the music and the arrangement of the tracks; however I had hoped for lengthier songs w/ a bit more depth. The tracks are not too much more than what you actually see in the movie, but they are full songs. For the great price ($11 + s/h) I would recommend it, but not for anything more expensive.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I have read, and re read these books from my childhood. The subtle art of deduction by Sherlock Holmes is just too good to put down anytime. Anytime you are bored pick up and read a small story which will surely make you think. Before you know you would be doing your own deductions of the surrondings :-)
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|Yeah, this album is not good at all.  \\"My Shadow\\" is passable; the highlight of this dismal album.  Keane is a great, great band, but this album is pretty bad.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|I love this series.  I found this book to not be as good as the previous but definitely worth a read if you like the Outlander Series.  It sets the stage for what is coming more than has an interesting story line I believe.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i absolutely love this book. it had me reading constantly and i had it done within 1 or 2 days. the characters are incredible and i could imagine myself in their positions. i cannot wait to read the next book and see what happens between katniss and peeta. great read.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|The positives: Beautifully shot in Northern Italy.  If you've ever been there you'd understand.  Great interplay between the characters - the burnt-out hitman who'd like to move to a paranoia-free life, the prostitute who's looking for a permanent connection, the priest who really wants to free a darkened soul from his torment.  The negatives:  you could see the plot ending from miles away. George Clooney's one-expression-fits-all-situations acting is a detraction, but the interaction of the characters makes up for it. Overall:  I'd watch it again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i love these books. i have already read the series twice and am about to start again. by the end of the series you absolutely love all of the characters and when it ends you miss them so much that you just have to read the series again. i especially love peeta because he is so kind and reassuring throughout the books and makes the saddest parts bareable. but even with peeta i was so emotional throughout the series. i cried waaaaaaay more than once. katniss is the perfect main character and gives the story a rare fire and edge. i definately reccomend this book as long as you can withstand the emotions. read away.
B001QOGYFY|3.0|I originally saw this film, about murder and mayhem at a scientific station at the South Pole, on HBO and was a bit disapponted.  I picked it up on blu-ray and watched it again and enjoyed it more the second time.  The film based on a graphic novel is interesting but does have its flaws.  The fight scenes out in the cold are okay, but it is difficult to tell who everyone is and as a result the suspense is diluted.  Furthermore the macguffin of the mysterious cargo that men are dying and killing for is, once revealed, a distinct disappointment.  The sets are very nicely designed and the scenes at the South Pole, (actually filmed at Lake Manitoba in Canada,) are beautiful  But the really most beautiful thing in this film is Kate Beckinsale.  I found her absolutely gorgeous in \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  My opinion didn't change in the \\"Underworld\\" films or the disappointing \\"Van Helsing.\\"  I think she is one of the prettiest actresses in films and can even make a burnt-out U.S. Federal Marshal at the South Pole look good.  (The writers obviously knew what their main asset was since they almost immediately have her strip down to take a shower.  No nudity however.) The supporting cast is good  with Tom Skeritt a standout.  Alex O' Laughlin also appears and uses what is probably his normal Austrailian accent.  Watching him in this film makes me realize why I have a hard time accepting him as McGarrett on the new \\"Hawaii Five-O.\\"  The picture and sound quality on the blu-ray are great.  There is a nice documentary on the making of the film (where Beckinsale looks more beautiful than ever.)  There is also a interesting featurette comparing the graphic novel with the completed film.  There are also a couple of fairly long deleted scenes.  As stated, this is a well-made film that kind of came and went in the theaters.  It is not bad and not great, but a fairly enjoyable way to spend an hour and forty minutes.  And, in case I haven't mentioned it, that Kate is soooo beautiful!
B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence, set in 1931 in Australia, brings to light the eugenic policies of the Australian government's attempts to \\"helping\\" Australia's interracial aborigines or half-castes.  For almost 80 years the Nazi-like policy attempted to remove all half-caste aboriginal children from their families and place them in government camps to re-educate, convert to Christianity and give them a place in White society.  The movie leaves one feeling with extreme discontent and maybe even confusion given the attitude of A.O. Neville in that he believes he is saving the children from themselves.   The movie tells the incredible story of three young half-caste children, 14-year old Molly, 10-year old Gracie and 8-year old Daisy as they are abducted right from the arms of their tribe and taken thousands of miles away to a notorious camp for half-castes.  At the camp there are basically herded around daily and sleep in room sized dormitory buildings where their latrine is a simple bucket in the back of the room.  There are not allowed to speak their native language and anyone is who caught breaking the rules is put into an outhouse looking shack as punishment, sometimes even receiving physical beatings as punishment.  The three young girls stay isn't very long at all as the eldest girl Gracie, hastily leads them out of the camp within a couple days and on their way back to Jigalong, their home.   After learning about the rabbit-proof fence prior to their kidnapping, the girls use this fence to find their way back home.  Their journey, however, is made quite difficult as the expert Aboriginal tracker Moodoo is hot on their trails nearly the entire way.  The girls walk for months with almost no water or food across the scorching Australian landscape.  The only solace they find is in the strangers they meet along the way.  Even though very young, Molly is very cunning and intelligent as she leads the group back to their home as they evade Moodoo and distrust the people that tryto trick them into being captured and taken back to the camp.   As an indigenous tribe that is being pushed out and/or being taken over by the ever consuming and expanding white man, I can see the relationship that the Australian aborigines share with the other indigenous tribes throughout the world.  The expansion of the modernized world has forced all of these tribes to relocate, adapt, to a certain degree, or be somewhat influenced by the larger governing force.  Some tribes are successful in staying true to their sacred ways while other have totally adapted to a modern lifestyle.  The saddest thing to me is when a part of a tribe is forcefully removed from their home and brainwashed into nearly forgetting the past and tribal religions & beliefs only to return later feeling like they were never there at all or that they don't belong.  In the textbook \\"Living Religions\\" (8th edition) in chapter 2 mentions Eliza Saunders, an Australian aboriginals who five children were taken away from her while she and her husband were job hunting.  One of her children speaks of when they return home: \\"When myself and my brothers and sisters return home, we five sit there quite mute and just listen, observe. Because we were never there.\\"  There is no amount of apology or remorse anyone can have to heal the wounds created by aggressive colonization or inhumane government policies.  Only time and forgiveness can heal those wounds.  And there will always be the scare left for everyone to see.    Steven M. Christin
B000ZMVAXO|3.0|This little piece of work packs a lot for such a little thing. I use it on my B.C. Rich Warlock and it screams, this is great when you want to bring your electric with you on your journeys as I will.<br /><br />Update 8/22/2013 I never use this anymore it just sits. I have a nice amp and a pedal so there is no need for it anymore unless I start gigging, which will probably not happen.<br /><br />THE ONE PROBLEM: I had to return the first one I recieved because it would make this terrible sirenlike sound, and I couldn't figure out what it was. 2 weeks later I got a new one for free and after using it for awhile the same thing.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It's a bit tough to learn how to play this game at first. But it's well worth it. It's easy to lose hours playing this game. Settler of Catan is a unique and entertaining. My only complaint is that the cardboard border pieces that keep the hexagons in place tend to get bent and difficult to put together if you're not careful.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|This CD has a lot of powerful songs. There also is a wonderful balance between powerful and soft, the assembling of songs just fits perfectly unlike a lot of other CD's I've listened to. The Greatest Hits Album is a One-of-a-Kind Piece of Art. Highly enjoyable!
B001DF68MA|5.0|I got this so that I could ride my bike with my one year old. It takes a little bit of time to mount. It's not difficult, just a little tedious. It fits on my Schwinn Frontier perfectly. I can have it as far forward as possible on the mounting bracket and still have complete range of motion in the handlebars. It's amazing how the bike doesn't really feel any different in terms of balance even with the added weight. It's really nice.    I put my daughter in it on a couple of occasions prior to mounting it. This allowed me to adjust the straps on it and to let her feel it out a bit. Once it was on the bike, I strapped her in and we went on our first short ride. She LOVED it! If we stopped for too long, she'd hop in the seat as if to say \\"Let's go!\\".    She seems comfortable. No complaints yet. I do have to adjust my knees out to the side a bit but it's not incredibly uncomfortable. It's definitely worth what you get. I love having her in front of me because I can hear her and see what she's doing and talk to her. I am also used to standing up on my bike to get leverage up hills but that's not really possible with the seat installed. Guess I'll just have to build up different muscles.    Great seat. You won't be disappointed.
1401323952|5.0|I Have found this to be a great cook book easily to use recipes with not to much ingredients to worry about, recomend it to everyone.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|I was very impressed all around with this case!  There are smaller ones available that are satisfactory for the smallest digital cameras, but just try tucking an extra card in there for emergencies.  This case is just large enough to fit practically any point-and-shoot camera, yet provides plenty of protected space for cards, etc.  Padding and build are excellent.  I also tried slipping a small Canon HD camcorder with battery into mine, and it fit like the bag was designed for it.  So if you need to bring a camcorder someplace without bulk and fuss, definitely check this out!
B0017OB12O|5.0|A Bridge on the River Kwai is by far one of the best War films ever made.  the plot is intriguing, the characters are interesting and have depth, and the acting is superb (Especially by the late Alec Guinness).  The only drawbacks may be the length, and what kind of comes across as a nihilistic ending, but really those aren't much of an issue.  A must watch, and must own for any war film enthusiast.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|This is apparently Disney's attempt to make a film similar to Seabiscuit.  Mostly it works, with a decent cast and some fantastic camera work at the horse races.  It is also an interesting story for anyone to watch; you do not need to be a fan of racing to enjoy it.    The part where Sec is being born is unintentionally funny because the little foal bangs right into the camera, which you can hear going \\"clunk.\\"   Hilarious!  I would have edited that part had I been in charge.
160094048X|5.0|I got this as a present for my sister, and she loves it! We've made a few of the recipes so far, and they are excellent. Great for anyone with a sweet tooth :)
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|The action violence seems overdone to me in this film, with thousands of bullets being fired, several explosions, and so on.  However, it is worth watching for the sheer entertainment value, and the casting is great--especially of John Malkovich as an operative who is just chock-full of nutty goodness and some justified paranoia.    It is really wild to see Helen Mirren gunning people down and wearing combat boots with a formal gown!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I saw this knife reviewed on quite a number of YouTube channels and after reading the very positive reviews on Amazon, decided to buy one. Wow, Wow, Wow, is my first impression of this Wonderful knife. It is a full quarter inch thick along the spine and built for some very serious work. The knife holds it edge very well even after batoning a lot of wood. If I had one suggested improvement, it would be that KaBar square the spine so that it could be with a ferrocerium rod, rather than having to use the knife blade.    All in all, a FANTASTIC knife and you will not go wrong with the purchase. Giving the modest price, you have nothing to lose and will gain one of the best built knives that I have ever laid my hands on!
1594202842|1.0|Amy Chua is intoxicated in her own sense of superiority.  A child's success should be the by-product from the passion in doing something that he/she loves; it should not be the result from his/her mom's screaming, yelling and threatening.  Should the mothers of Mozart and John Lennon take credit for their children's success?
B004DK49DW|5.0|Mike Ness does it again!  This album is a little different from \\"Sex, Love\\" but ALL of their albums are different from one another!  \\"Somewhere Between\\" doesn't sound anything like \\"Mommy's Little Monster\\", \\"Prison Bound\\", or \\"White Light\\".  His two solo albums had a large country influence.  So, if you're comparing this record to the past, you're really not seeing the full picture.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Mike Ness and co. consistently write GREAT songs.  They also evolve their sound from record to record.  This album has GREAT songs - full stop.<br /><br />If you like Social D, and you're not living in their original 1980s sound, you WILL like this album.  Have they ever disappointed you before?
0525423273|5.0|Anna Oliphant has no choice but to spend her senior year at in American high-school in Paris. She has nothing against France but leaving her friends behind and starting anew in a strange country is not what she wished for.<br />Fortunately she soon finds new friends who are willing to show her the most beautiful and exciting places in Paris. And there's on boy in special that Anna can't stop thinking about. &Eacute;tienne St.Clair is the most charming person Anna has ever met and just like all the other girls she isn't immune to him. Through her new friend Mer she soon  becomes close to Etienne however she fights against her feelings because he has a girlfriend.<br />Will Anna learn to appreciate her time in Paris and will she and Etienne get a happy end?<br /><br />In the last few weeks I read one raving review of \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" after another. So I looked up the book and was suprised because it sounded pretty normal. But still I decided to order it because I wanted to know if it's really so amazing. And after reading it the only thing left to do is write yet another raving review because this books was wonderful and powerful.<br />Even though it's a YA book I think most adults will enjoy it as well. The main themes of this book are friendship, love and dealing with changes. Anna is an amazing heroine and I enjoyed everything about her. She felt like a real person and almost like a friend. The other characters in this book like &Eacute;tienne , Mer, etc. were just as interesting and great. Especially &Eacute;tienne and his charming, complex personality was fascinating and I loved all of the scenes between him and Anna. The friendship and love story between Anna and Etienne was wonderful and I enjoyed that they had time to get to know each other and that the pace of the book was a relaxed one.<br />Stephanie Perkins's writing style is very powerful. Normally I have troble envisioning things but Perkins managed to make me see Paris through Anna's eyes and at the end of the book I felt like I had just visited Paris myself. I'm already excited to read the next novel by Stephanie Perkins and to once again be amazed by her wonderful and engaging way with words.<br />If you are looking for a marvellous book that will make you feel like you just took a trip to Paris with some good friends then \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" is the book for you.<br /><br />cover<br />I like the cover because it's simple and looks nice.<br /><br />final appraisal<br />\\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" is a wonderful YA book about love, friendship and life in general.

B00006LPER|4.0|Where else could you set the story of a sexually-repressed masochistic woman except in Vienna, where \\"hysteria\\" was sufficiently common to provide a living wage for a cadre of 'alienists' which included one Sigmund Freud? And wouldn't Siggy have been delighted with this film! It's his whole corpus of psychoanalytic observation captured visually. Viewer beware! If you are inclined to regard Freudian psychology with skepticism, you'll detest this film. But it's not a balmy evening's entertainment by any measure. Erika --the 'piano teacher' acted with agonizing credibility by Isabelle Huppert -- is a loathsome harpy [ 'harpy' is an ancient Greek synonym for the B word ] and not the sort of victim of mental illness for whom you'll feel sympathy or pity. In fact, the only character in this film that drew any sympathy from me was the young woman piano student whom Erika victimized.<br /><br />That student's mother is a pushy whiner, a perfect specimen of the new category of \\"Tiger Mom.\\" Conservatory moms, let me tell you, are more than a match for soccer moms or hockey moms in tigerishness. But Erika's mom, acted by Annie Girardot, is the veritable Medusa or Mozart's Queen of the Night. I know nothing at all about the biography of director Michael Haneke except that his mother was an Austrian actress, but I can't help imagining that he has \\"issues\\" with parenting. This is the second film of his that I've seen in one week. I chose his 2009 film 'The White Ribbon' at my local video rental shop, chiefly because of the photo on the box. That film impressed me enough that I went back to rent 'The Piano Teacher,' a film released in 2001. In the newer film, it's Fatherhood that takes the rap for sociopathy, while in this older film, Motherhood catches some of the blame for psychosis. See what I mean? I can't wait to see what hatefulness Haneke attributes to the influence of uncles!<br /><br />Music is the lubricant for perverse attractions in this film. The handsome, sensitive, accomplished young man -- Walter, acted by Benoit Magimel -- mistakes Erika's ardor for music for sensual passion; there could be no other explanation for his fixation on her, since she hardly exudes physicality. I wasn't entirely convinced by Walter's initial attraction to Erika. I had to 'willingly suspend disbelief' until the double helix of moral degeneration between the two started spiraling downwards. Music is used brilliantly in this film, edited so that the strains of Schubert persist across the temporal boundaries of scenes. Brilliant editing of both sound and picture is possibly the strongest asset of The Piano Teacher.<br /><br />As I said above, this isn't a film you'll properly enjoy. It's brutally savage and too distorted to be tragic. In fact, if you empathize with this film, you might consider consulting a competent Freudian analyst; I can recommend one if you live in Stockholm. The merits of the film are chiefly 'artistic' and cinematographic: powerful dialogue and direction, excellent camera work and editing, stellar performances by Huppert, Girardot, and Magimel.ng man -- Walter, acted by Benoit Magimel -- mistakes Erika's ardor for music for sensual passion; there could be no other explanation for his fixation on her, since she hardly exudes physicality.

0545140323|5.0|16 year old Penny Lane is tired of boys who make her feel like she's stupid. After being disappointed by a guy she knew and had feelings for since they were kids Penny decides to form The Lonely Hearts Club and to just concentrate on herself for the rest of highschool. At first she is the only club member but soon more and more girls want to join.<br />What will Penny do when things surrounding the club get more and more complicated and when a cute guy becomes more and more interesting?<br /><br />When I started reading \\"The Lonely Hearts Club\\" I feared that the book could be a bit too young for me however it wasn't. Elizabeth Eulberg's writing style was very engaging and I was happy that she didn't use too much teenage language. And themes like love, friendship and self-worth are interesting for all age groups.<br />I especially enjoyed reading about the heroine of the book. Penny Lane is a normal 16 year old girl, she is very likable and I enjoyed how she handled her life. Her development throughout the book was fascinating and great. The way she kept the club together and never lost the happiness of her friends out of her sight was heart-warming. I also enjoyed that the club concentrated on helping the girls become more confident. It wasn't about something like sex is bad but about concentrating on yourself and doing what you enjoy.<br />All in all I was positively suprised by \\"The Lonely Hearts Club\\" and think that it's a very cute, funny and lovely book for teens and adults.<br /><br />cover<br />I like it because it fits to the book and I like the Beatles reference.<br /><br />final appraisal<br />I was suprised at how well the story worked for me. Although most of the main characters are only 16 the book didn't feel too young. I enjoyed reading about The Lonely Hearts Club and think that Penny Lane was an amazing heroine. The way themes like friendship, love and being disappointed by boys were portrayed made this book very entertaining and lovely.
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|Finally finished Stieg Larsson's The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, the final volume in his Millennium trilogy. I really enjoyed all three books and my introduction to Swedish crime fiction. Too bad he passed away after completing this trilogy and never saw his huge success. But what a legacy.<br />This is a great conclusion to a wonderful trilogy. I will reread in future. Found it a fascinating look inside Swedish society, journalism and the secret police. It's theme really is about abused women and the men who enable this abuse. All three books are a great read and highly recommended.<br />James A Anderson, Author<br />DEADLINE
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|As always, a GREAT Bruce Willis movie, with a great cast. Hope they make another movie ( RED 2 ) or one like it
0545265355|5.0|This series will have you sucked in.  From the first page I could not put down the books. This is a great love story that will keep you wondering through all 3 books about what is going to happen, but also the hard life that Katniss has had to suffer and go through to stay alive. As I read these books I did not expect what was going to happen next and will keep you guessing. This series made me laugh and actually cry. It has a great ending, not what I expected, even better.
0765322889|5.0|These books are excellent but unforgiving to the stupid or mentally lazy. This first book is light on exposition and spoon fed explanations of what is happening. If you like the idea of a fantasy mystery you will probably enjoy this very much. If you yell at the screen during movies you should probably pass. There are plenty of books without a learning curve out there.    For those who have compared Erikson to George RR Martin, there is one HUGE difference. Erikson actually finished this series, the last book will be out in March of 2011. As far as I can tell Martin has stopped writing and has abandoned his series completely.

B002TKU22A|5.0|Great!
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|The movie starts out with an a priori that the devil exist and takes human form. Part of the movie is narration. His gateway is a suicide, which happens early, as a man falls on a Bethel Bread truck. (Bethel is Hebrew for house of God.) An investigator, who lost his family in a hit and run 5 years ago is talking in a restaurant to a man we never see again. He tells him that &#34;the ability to forgive determines the quality of the rest of your life.&#34; While investigating the suicide, another murder happens with 5 people trapped in an elevator.<br /><br />We don't know much about these people, or for that fact we never get to know any of the characters. We do know from all the narration chatter that one of these people is the devil. It is up to us, the audience, to figure out who it is. I won't tell you who it is, but I was able to nail the person right off, having seen &#34;10 Little Indians.&#34; There is a fleeting clue in the film too. For someone who is new to horrors with twists, this might be a good beginner. For seasoned viewers, you might find the movie a bit slow and predictable.<br /><br />The acting was good and did what it could to save the script, a solid three and a half stars overall. I will say one thing, the Philadelphia Fire Department was never that slow when Rizzo was mayor.
B000001F9N|5.0|this album is the best of donna summer by far. all the songs are worth, from the first continuous 17 minutes to the cover version to the other dance soul tracks.
B00192IV9U|3.0|I absolutely adored Michael; and though the songs on this CD are okay, they were Not up to Michael's usual standards. I don't believe he would have released these songs; they weren't polished enough to carry his brand. The entire CD seems like someone raided copies of Michael's practice sessions, and pushed out a hurried copy. I will of course keep the CD because I loved him, but I am disappointed that the powers that be released such an anemic \\"tribute\\" to such a genius.
B0016MJ6T2|5.0|Oh great. I ordered from Amazon and now I'm on a porn snail mail list. Calling the porn shop, they said the only way I could get on their list is to sign up for it (which I didn't), or order something online (which I did). Amazon dot com was one of two places I ordered stuff from, and the other was battery mart dot com.  So one of you two sites is the culprit, renting customer INFO to the porn industry. SHAME ON YOU.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|The best I ever used. The GPS and all other features are very good and the clock is comfortable. The menu and bezel features are well designed. The only problem so far was that the information in the manuals is too simple. I needed around 3 to 4 hours to get the clock and the ANT agent to communicate with each other, so the run could be downloaded to my laptop and see the extraordinary report in myGarmin web. I followed the instructions, but in every step I found new complications. Finally I was exploring the ANT menu and realized to put everything in Yes. It seems obvious and stupid, but it is not. Reading the manual it seems like an automatic feature, but several were disabled and the manual didn't cover all the possibilities shown in the menu.  I would suggest Garmin people to try to make a comprehensive manual covering every corner of the menu. If you are not familiar with computers and software, you will need help because there are additional upgrades that I had to install additionally to the software indicated by Garmin.  You have several displays available during training but I couldn't find one with the heart rate in big numbers. For presbiopic people it would be a plus. Not everyone has a perfect vision.
B000O1799U|1.0|There will be no toe tapping, and gone are the days when you leave a musical movie humming a tune from the film. This is a musical with songs so banal that you will not remember them three minutes after leaving the theater.

0553805371|4.0|A great short high-level discussion of western physical science and philosophy since Classical Greek, Newton, Descartes, General Relativity, Quantum Theory,  M-Theory.    He dismisses philosophy before discussing the important and highly philosophical idea of \\"Model-dependent Realism\\", which is the foundation upon which the science stands,  Philosophy and Science should not dismiss each other, they are inseparable.    Model-dependent realism. Gravity as negative energy. Apparent laws vs M-Theory. Multiple histories.    My small complaint:  when they get to the last chapter of this short book, they seem to be in a great rush.  They spent more time on the classical Greeks than on this final chapter called \\"The Grand Design\\".
074322454X|5.0|A thoroughly engrossing and accurate portrayal, this book is superior in examining the experiences of the 101st Airborne, 506 PIR, E Company in the European Theater of Operations. Consistently easy to read and full of excellent military history, one can clearly picture each man and feels as though they are along with them through Normandy, Bastogne, and beyond. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to further their knowledge of the American experience in the Last Great War.

I will comment on my progress as I go along each week so that real people can make a decision for themselves.
B003BKF696|1.0|I won't add anything about the music beyond what others have said, and only post to note the dreadful (if sadly de facto now) compression used in this release. One wonders how much more this music would shine if carefully and professionally mastered (rather than being engineered to sound acceptable as mp3 on plastic computer speakers).     Home taping never killed music, but modern mastering techniques certainly are as more and more people refuse to pay for shoddy product and find other ways to listen...
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Connelly's newest is essentially half Mickey Haller book, half Bosch book, and the pairing makes for an interesting collaboration. The Reversal is basically a legal thriller, revolving around a death row inmate whose conviction has been overturned, and who is being retried by the state - represented by Mickey Haller, who's usually on the defense side of things. I've read a few complaints that The Reversal is too straightforward, without a lot of twists, but in many ways that's exactly what I liked about the book. Connelly's books are often like his prose - they may be workman like, and they may never bring poetic flair, but they're well-chosen and still the work of a man who knows his way around the world he's writing about, and their low-key nature does nothing to eliminate their effectiveness and their impact. As always, Bosch remains a compelling creation by Connelly, and it's nice to see Haller's world continue to expand and develop, as well as bringing these two characters closer to each other's orbits. Moreover, Connelly's books always feel like a reflection of their times, and The Reversal is no exception - this book feels very much of the moment, and lives and dies by its LA setting. The Reversal isn't my favorite Connelly - while the plot is involving and gripping, people are right when they say it's not all that twisty, and while I admire the ideas behind the ending, one can't help but feel that it's a little anticlimactic, even if that is the point. Nonetheless, I still recommend the book; I love entering Connelly's world and the moral shades of gray he explores, all while telling involving and even moving stories, and The Reversal is no different at all. Connelly's characters may be aging, and his world changing, but I hope his books keep right on coming, because even lesser ones like this are fantastic reads that really work for me.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I loved this movie; Dylan finally opened up and speaks frankly about the early years (Pre motorcycle accident.)  Most of my favorite music was mad and recorded during the time period presented in this movie.  To me Dylan gave us the impression of an apathy about his wrote, sure they were protest song, but they really didn't protest anything specific.  Perhaps that is why his music is timeless.  The movie gave me a new view on Dylan, but not necessarily a bad view just different.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Have watched this movie many times with my children and have loved it. Now they want to share the same experiences that we had with their own children and qiute frankly i still love to watch the movie myself.
B004LEQI52|4.0|The show was entertaining, but not perfect.  The shapeshifters haven't broken their faces before, so this seemed like a cheap trick to invoke a reaction from the audience.  Having the machine 'weaponize' Peter seems like a rehash of the Fauxlivia storyline.  It also yanks responsibility form the character and robs us of an opportunity to see his personality in more depth.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This was her best book, and the best book I have read in a long time. I wanted to read all night, like I did as a teenager.
030746363X|5.0|Do not buy this book unless you want to totally change your life. I am 45, and was about 100 pounds overweight. In the first three weeks lost 17 pounds and 2.5 inches off my waist, with no exercise. This is not a diet book, it's a do-over. All the bad habits I allowed myself for being a truck driver are gone. I had given up, thinking that obesity was an occupational hazard. This book has literally saved my life, and increased the quality 1000%. I would have paid three times as much as the retail price.
B0030BCCAM|5.0|Great albums from Zombies singer;  great package of first 3 solo albums.  Now how about doing the same for the next batch.  Too bad they're on different labels.
B001UGIIMA|5.0|When I was in D.C. in 2001, I saw this movie at the Union Station AMC.  Besides the best place to see this movie, I loved it.  I've watched it maybe 40 times and have it on DVD, iPod, and will get it on Blu-Ray very shortly.  It is one of the best movies I have ever watched--enough action for the guy and a 'love story' for all others.  I have a short list of favorites: Deja Vu, Top Gun, Shooter, Enemy of the State, but Spy Game is the movie I never turn off...
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Nothing against Oprah, except when it comes to narrating the phenomenal nature series, LIFE. Mr. Attenborough has spent a lifetime in the field researching (and narrating dozens of films himself) nature and just keeps getting better. I always look forward to his next film, because (and you can hear it in his voice) so does he! And if you don't believe me check: [...]
B0000DJZA5|2.0|My criteria are    A) maintain the original running order-- it is too deeply ingrained in the psyche to change  B) wherever possible maintain the stage/studio banter, as this conveys the original intent of the album and is enduringly charming however much of a gloss      1) Two of Us-- the ORIGINAL release has the priceless stage/studio banter (\\"I dig a pony by Charles...!) and is a more polished performance with a pleasing intimacy  2) Dig a Pony-- as with Two of Us, the ORIGINAL release wins because the performance is more polished with pleasing intimacy  3) Across the Universe-- the NAKED version is much more engaging at a slightly higher pitch and speed (a frequent Beatles studio trick) and without the intrusive Spector strings. the result is far more intimate and vaguely reminiscent of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\"  4) I Me Mine-- the NAKED version is better without the Spector overdubs  5) Dig It-- it's only on the ORIGINAL and adds to the Beatles charm if nothing else. You can't leave it off.  6a)+ 6b) Let It Be-- an iconic tune, so it's worth hearing both the ANTHOLOGY and NAKED versions-- the former for the rawer emotional content and Lennon's \\"Hey Jude\\"-esque harmonies, and the latter for its McCartney-esque polish but without those unnecessary Spector arrangements indulgently slathered on. i feel the pain of leaving off Harrison's great guitar solo on the original version but the strings ruin the song and i can't look past that  7) Maggie Mae-- see the notes to (5)\\"Dig It\\". ORIGINAL  8) I've Got a Feeling-- ORIGINAL version is still superior in feel and performance plus there is \\"ohhhh my soul\\" in the fadeout  9) One After 909-- the ORIGINAL stands up because of the \\"Danny Boy\\" impromptu tag at the end  10) The Long and Winding Road-- the ORIGINAL version is still best and this happens to be the one song where Spector's production polish makes sense and fits the song. Or you can say his outsized ego doesn't overwhelm the material. Only trouble here is that it is atotal departure from the notion of being a live band. But outside of that context it is effective and affecting.  11) Don't Let Me Down-- not on the original release but surely belongs there. but the NAKED version is far more spontaneous and immediate in my opinion  12a)+ 12b) Get Back-- both the ANTHOLOGY and the ORIGINAL versions are a toss-up, the ANTHOLOGY because of the nice jam-my vibe and the ORIGINAL because of the \\"pass the audition\\" comments.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|From start to finish this album is great. Now they just need to put this entire album on Rock Band so we can play these songs!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I was very pleased to see the condition it was when I opend the cd containers.  The mail wrap was too good, but all was well.  Very happy.
B003QZ5222|5.0|If somebody hasn't bought all of Springsteen's albums or cds by now, here is the perfect excuse to do so.  Not a total remastering, but the sound is better than the older lp mixes on cd releases.  I admit I haven't had time to play every single one of them yet, but what i have heard was like visiting an old friend who sounds better than ever.  I applaud Columbia/Sony/BMG for releasing these collections, I just don't like the mini lp sleeves.  How about some kind of plastic inner sleeve inside them?
B003UYV08E|5.0|Two hours of fun. Takes off right where Ironman (1) left off. RD Jr definitely had fun in this role, and it shows. A new nemesis surfaces in this movie, and we get to see a little more of Ironman's past as well. S.H.I.E.L.D makes another appearance as we learn about Tony's father. (Apparently Iroman 2 is set on the timeline before Tony Stark becomes director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) We also find out that he is slowly dying in this show, so we get to see how TOny Stark deals with his humanity. Don't worry though, there is plenty of action and humor during the movie.     I purchased Ironman 2 somewhere before, but lost it - I enjoyed it so much that I had to buy a replacement. Look for the 2012 release of The Avengers to see if Ironman makes an appearance.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Greedo shooting first changed Han's whole character aura and profile. Before George Lucas edited the original scene, Greedo pulls a pistol on Han Solo in the bar and we see Han sneakily pull out his pistol hidden in his jacket while at the same time hes smooth talking Greedo over and then Han all of a sudden Han shoots Greedo in the head. This made Han look like a cool \\"renegade\\" or \\"rogue\\" character because he shoots Greedo just to make sure Greedo doesn't pull a fast one. But in the new version of this scene George changed it to where Greedo shoots and somehow misses, and then Han shoots after Greedo shot...this edited version of the scene makes Han look like he is defending him self rather than taking pre-emptive action against Greedo. Many people thought it was awesome how Han was in the original cut, and so by editing the scene, the new version actually waters down Han's character and really did nothing to enhance the movie. So this is what many people, including myself, do not like about the new edited scene.
B004FOJZXU|5.0|This is a great set.  Ordered from Electronica Direct through Amazon.  Was a little concerned about Region 2, however the Blu Ray is region free and plays on any US Blu Ray player, only the DVD version is zoned 2 and will not work in a US Blu Ray.  Digital Copy works as well.  Hope that clarifies.
0307474712|5.0|The character development was fantastic.  You feel invested in the characters as well as the story.  Their weaknesses, strengths, and actions are so plausible which leaves you living in their shoes.  It's been a long time since I read a book straight through in one day.
B00005JLD4|4.0|Human history is rife with examples of injustice in the name of progress. Rabbit Proof Fence examines the story of one such injustice. The movie is a tale of the fate of members of the \\"Stolen Generations\\", Australian Aborigines forcibly separated from their native culture.   This is the yarn of three young girls, Molly, Gracie, and Daisy born as half-castes in Western Australia in the early 20th century. Their fathers were white migrant laborers who had left the Aborigine mothers with mixed race babies. According to Australian law (the Aborigines Act) at the time, A. O. Neville was appointed as Chief Protector of Aborigines. Neville was endowed with the power to remove half-caste children from their families and send them to training camps to become more like the people of European descent.     The plot of Rabbit Proof Fence is that Molly, her sister Daisy, and their cousin Gracie are yanked away from their mothers in their native Jigalong and sent 1200 miles away to a camp called Moore River. The film follows the girls' escape from Moore River and trek back to Jigalong along the parts of the rabbit fence that dissected much of Australia at the time to protect farmland. Without giving up too much of the story, along the way girls meet folks of both races, for good and for ill results. The whole time Mollie and the girls are being hounded by a native tracker who works for Mr. Neville.    I watched the movie as part of a class I am taking on world religions. I chose Rabbit Proof Fence because I was interested in observing Aboriginal belief and culture in conjunction with the reading of my text book Living Religions (Fisher 2011).     Living Religions Chaper 2 describes indigenous spirituality as a lifeway. The Aborignal culture in the film appears to weave it's beliefs  into the way it lives as \\"every when\\", as mentioned by Fisher. In one scene, Mollie is told by her mother that a bird in the sky is her \\"spirit guide\\". Fisher's book speaks of the common primal religious theme of holy animals, \\"Trees, animals, insects, and plants are all approached with caution and consideration\\" (Fisher).  Mollie's spirit guide helps her when she has almost died in the desert and shows her she is close to home. Ritual singing is another way the indigenous practitioner connects with the spirit world (Fisher).  The women of Mollie's tribe in the movie know the children are trying to escape and are getting nearer home. They sing an apparently ritualistic song to protect and guide the girls back to Jigalong.     Today, again according to my textbook reading (Living Religions Chapter 13), all religions are under assault by globalization. Rabbit Proof Fence is a perfect example of the beginning of this assault on native beliefs. Here we see the concepts of white, supposedly refined and logical European thinking, attempting to homogenize and destroy Aboriginal culture.     This film is a fictional drama based on real events. As such, it is a powerful and emotionally moving story. It is well worth watching. You may want some tissues handy.
B0043EV774|4.0|When I shopped for this movie, all I wanted was the movie in 3-D, not the other 3 disc's.  I have no use for them and it just cost me to much to get the one I wanted.  At the time I could not see any other way to get it.  Not very fair to force me to buy that way just to get the one I wanted.
B00009NQQO|3.0|My son recieved this toy when he was about 18 months old, and we started using the big bath tub.  He likes it well enough, even though the fact that the net doesn't have a hole in it was frustrating for him at first.  We have to stick it to the inside of the bathtub ... the suction cups don't work unless you have completely flat tiles (ours are uneven).  But my biggest problem is with the balls ... they quickly grow mold inside, and I can't get it out!  So needless to say, we will be looking for something else.
B0034KZE9U|4.0|i work anywhere from 6 to 14 hours a day in very busy busy kitchen i love these have had 2 pairs about to get a 3rd i have tired the berks everything in the 14 yrs in a kitchen never want to go back to anything else only problem i had the sole started to peel off after a year and half and super glue hopefully they hold until the new ones get here
B000Q5SUT2|1.0|This movie drifts into absurdity.  The scenes when it tries to slip into operatic mode are not convincing and poorly produced.  From there it rapidly declines into meaningless drivel and unlike any opera I have seen, and that is many, I feel that it should make up it's mind about what it wants to be.  I wish for something more than a recital of rock songs trying to blend into a plot.  The plot is based on the Supreme's who were a top national act who sang some of the greatest songs of the sixties.  They should sue the makers of this picture for trivializing their image.  This quickly becomes the first black soap opera I have seen.  Looking at the prices for this on this site pretty much confirm my thoughts.  Not many movies have a price of $4.99 for new copies of them.
B004IM14RY|5.0|Giving the fact that all you see during this movies is a guy, a cell phone, a lighter, a cescet and a knife - this movie is great. I watched this movie not knowing what it was about and was more then impressed. Great acting, even greater plot. For me this was a 5 out of 5 stars.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Turned up much earlier than expected. I was very pleased with the quality and the fact that I had no trouble with the DVD region. This was an older film that you cannot get in Australia on DVD so I am really happy with it. This is the best adaptation of Persuasion
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this series from start to fininh.  Great show. Interesting personalities that blend well under Heddie's guidance.  What a character!
1600108512|4.0|If you're contemplating purchasing the comic adaptation of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" , chances are that this will not be your first foray into the world created by Peter S. Beagle in his best-known novel. In \\"The Last Unicorn\\",  a unicorn discovers that she is the last of her kind and sets out on a quest to discover that has become of her kin. If you're like me, you've read the book and watched the movie, and so as a fan you might wonder what this newest incarnation of the story has to offer.<br /><br />The Last Unicorn comic gathers the 6 separate issues released by IDW publishing into one full color hard-cover volume. From a purely aesthetic standpoint the book design is impeccable, with violet foil lettering on front and back and a classy layout. The six chapters that make up the book are separated by pages that sport the same illustrations that were featured on the covers of the respective single comic issues.<br /><br />There is immediately something a little more \\"grown up\\" about the comic adaptation as opposed to the animated movie. Renae de Liz's style may have much to do with this. Her illustrations tend more toward stylized realism than the far more soft, cartoony style  employed in the movie. Ray Dillon's colors are atmospheric and brooding. Characters such as the Harpy Celaeno, Mommy Fortuna, Ruhk and  King Haggard are actually frightening to look at in the comic version, while their movie versions are a little more approachable. For those comfortable with the representations of characters such as the unicorn (Lady Amalthea), Schmendrick and Molly Grue shown in the 80's animated movie, the character designs of the comic certainly pay homage to those designs.<br /><br />What is particularly enjoyable about this adaptation is that plot points and scenes that were in the original novel but omitted from the movie have been included in the comic.  There is a magician mentor named Nikos, who turned a male unicorn into a human. As in the novel, Schmendrick is cursed with youth, a side note that never made it into the animated feature. There is a city named Hagsgate again, and  Arachne is back in Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival as is \\"Elli\\". There is even a single page that alludes to the \\"blue bird\\" scene from the novel (in which a pair of married blue birds argue over whether or not the husband bird actually saw a unicorn).<br /><br />The extras at the end of the book include interviews of both Peters S. Beagle and Peter Gillis, the man who adapted The Last Unicorn into a comic book format. There is a small art gallery in the back that features pieces by guest artists  and  small thumbnails of the six  \\"alternate\\" comic book covers done by Frank Stockton. There are also half-page images taken directly from the comic (with the text bubbles removed) so that one may admire the layout of some very beautifully designed pages. These are often too small for my liking, but they are nice \\"extras\\".<br /><br />The comic is *almost* a complete triumph. I say almost because there is one omission that really should have made it into the comic. Once again, King Haggard's four aged men-at-arms are mentioned only in passing dialogue. Much like in the animated movie, the characters are never seen and their small arc and subsequent return to youth is cut from the story.  In his interview at the end of the comic, even Peter Gillis laments that these characters were once more cut out of the story due to page restrictions. Truly, it would have made this adaptation even more special to have this rather important plot point addressed in the comic book, even more so because it is left out of the movie. Other slight problems had to do with the panel pacing toward the end and the clunky descriptive text during the battle with the Red Bull. There was an over-use of sentences starting with \\"And...\\"  that started to feel very redundant. But I feel for the illustrator, who doubtlessly had a challenge shoving as much as possible onto the small amount of additional pages that were added. The page-limit on the comic was reached before the completion of the series. A total of 12 extra pages had to be added... and paid for out-of-pocket--not by IDW.<br /><br />For fans, the comic  is invaluable and does both the novel and the movie justice while offering strengths that are individual to the comic adaptation. It is a generally faithful retelling, obviously drawn and translated from the novel by people who truly cared about the story and the quality of the art. If you are fond of the novel, the movie or both, the graphic novel will be a welcome addition to your collection. Enjoy!itional pages that were added.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is quite literally my favorite TV show I've ever seen.  That it had such a short run makes my cry at night, but owning this DVD helps.  Every episode, every actor, every line of dialogue is just perfect.  I cannot get enough of it.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|it may start unhappy and end that way to but it is a great beggining book for a series. it will leave you wanting more.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This book was simply amazing. I loved every page, every word. The fever series is the best series ever! I can't get enough of Barrons! Awesome book!
B003K025V4|5.0|This album shows Miley Cyrus has matured in her voice and her music.  I just love Liberty Walk, Who Owns My Heart, and Two Lonely People.  Can't Be Tamed is an okay song with a good beat, but it's not my favorite.  I like her slow ballads, too, including Forgiveness and Love.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys good dance music.  If you like Miley, you'll enjoy this!
184448551X|4.0|The ONLY reason that I gave 4 stars was that I was hoping for more patterns.  There are many stitches to practice an use, to make a perfect sampler, to have a great time with.  This book shows how different stitches work in concert with one another.  It is great in showing how to fade the stitch, and how it looks as shading.  There are wonderful works of great stitchers in the back of the book as well as scattered al-through out.  Again my only slight disappointment was wanting a pattern of follow.  It's a great buy to work up to as well as practicing to become a master stitcher.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I know it makes me sound like an idiot, but this really is one of my top-ten favorite movies.  It's story has little to do with that, to be honest.  I just love the action sequences, the soundtrack, the animation, the voice acting (okay, some of it's not great, but for the most part it works), and of course the characters whom we'd already met in the video game.  I'd recommend this movie not only to Final Fantasy fans, but for anyone who likes to see interesting movies.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I bought a copy of this excellent movie from Amazon and was very disappointed with the quality. The top third of the screen was distorted in a manner that suggested a very dodgy pirated version. I feel ripped off its going to cost me more to retun it than its worth.   Don't buy this product from Amazon.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|The story of the birth of Facebook is not at all inherently interesting.  But a good director, a good script, and especially exuberant performances lift this film above what could have been childish frat house antics and boring lawyer meetings.    David Fincher's great pacing of Aaron Sorkin's long but carefully crafted screenplay give a charged atmosphere for the actors to come alive in.  The effect is a suspenseful biopic that I was not expecting.    Jesse Eisenberg's clipped and deliberate performance characterizes Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as alternately socially inappropriate and rigidly confident.  Zuckerberg initially comes off as aloof and arrogant, but he eventually loses some of his sharp edges and becomes somewhat sympathetic.    Other great performances include Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins (I was fooled here; I thought the unlikely event of a set of excellent twin actors had been cast in the film. The digital effects are that good.), Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker, and Andrew Garfield as Zuckerberg's business partner, Eduardo Saverin.  Garfield gives the most dramatic performance in the film.  It's clear Saverin wanted to be a partner with Zuckerberg on a great adventure, but they make difficult decisions and end up hurting each other.    If you don't care at all about Facebook or find it interesting how quickly the website spread around the world and made billions of dollars, you will still enjoy this film for the rest of its elements.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|My wife absolutely love this movie lol. Whatever makes her heart glade makes me glade.[[ASIN:B003VS0CWY The Sound of Music (45th Anniversary Edition) (Two-Disc DVD/Blu-ray Combo in DVD Packaging)]]
B001UV4XFG|5.0|well, first of all it arrived earlier than I expected. And the DVD quality and content are as expected too. Excellent :)
B000UX6THK|5.0|This is a really great version of the series. I loved the Log Lady intros to the episodes, and the quality of the video and sound was outstanding. It had been quite a few years since I watched the show, and my girlfriend and I loved it. Definitely a must have if you're a fan of the show, or if you enjoy challenging TV. It even has the famous Saturday Night Live skit with Kyle MacLachlan. Very cool!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|This movie is a very nice story that will give viewers an idea of the determination of a woman who breaks out of the mold of the 1970's wife and mother. Mrs. Tweedy is a somewhat upper class mother of four, married to a lawyer. As she is making breakfast for her spirited family one day in Denver she receives a call that will change her life in unexpected ways. She meets immediate challenges trying to take charge of her father's breeding race horse farm in Virginia; from the dishonest trainer to other breeders in the area, she manages to hold her own and continue her father's dream.   On a personal level I had to enjoy the tale that gave me a look back at the year I married and remember how different things were for a \\"housewife/homemaker\\". I learned quite a bit about a racehorse that I remembered from yesteryear. It was a nice trip back in time.
0143145088|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this well researched book.  While you may not agree with his conclusions he does provide many substantive arguments to back up his claims.  It is a worthwhile read and I recommend it highly.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Shouldn't stir up a hornet's nest, that's just asking for it. Frank Moses is a retired CIA wet works operative trying to fit a normal, if lonely, life in the 'burbs. But when Frank reaches out to a bored federal pension service representative named Sarah, when he tries to step out of his hermit's existence, somewhere in the paranoid bowels of the CIA, a red flag goes up. One dark night a CIA-sanctioned hit squad invades Frank's home. Frank Moses's top secret personal dossier is stamped \\"RED\\" - for \\"Retired, Extremely Dangerous.\\" They should've brought more hit squads.<br /><br />And now Frank Moses is all sorts of curious as to why a kill team was deployed against him. Off he goes looking for answers, low profile all shot to pieces.<br /><br />If you've read Warren Ellis's repressively bleak, gritty comic book RED, this movie adaptation'll surprise you some. With an eye towards a more audience-friendly product, the screenplay expands on and switches it up some from the original source. Three things stand out immediately and notably. The tone is more lighthearted, tongue-in-cheeky, and not as violent. Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker, really good) - who this time isn't Moses's case handler - achieves more camera time. And, unlike in the comic book in which he's strictly a lone wolf, Moses has a team to assemble. Or as Morgan Freeman's 80-year-old, liver-cancered rest home retiree remarks: \\"Well, we're getting the band back together. That's nice.\\" And maybe you can't teach old dogs new tricks. But these old dogs have perfected what tricks they do have. Today's CIA asshats have a job and a half trying to curb these - to steal a phrase from Holly Golightly - \\"mean REDs.\\"<br /><br />The absolutely top notch cast is what makes this film so much fun to watch. It's worth the price of admission just to see terrific old pros like Willis, Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren at play. These actors create a marvelous synergy. They even sort of channel that old Rat Pack cool. Bruce Willis still has the chops to pull of that action leading man role. And, to quote Warren Ellis: \\"Who wouldn't want to see Helen Mirren with a sniper rifle?\\" One of the most amusing tidbits divulged in the special features is that Mirren patterned her assassin character after the immaculate Martha Stewart. Karl Urban, fresh off knocking everyone's socks off as the re-imagined Dr. McCoy in STAR TREK, makes a credible - and even likable - antagonist. More old far+s get dusted off for cameos, such as Ernest Borgnine as the CIA's venerable records keeper and Richard Dreyfuss as a sleazy CEO of a defense contract company.<br /><br />RED, with its brisk cross-country jaunts and its root-for-the-badasss-geriatrics theme and its consistently entertaining beats, is also just off-kiltered enough to make it seem fresh. There's this light capery touch which graces even the film's most generic shoot-'em-up sequences. Given the caliber of the cast, RED would've had to work overtime to stink up the joint. As it is, it certainly made enough of a killing at the box office that a sequel is in the works.<br /><br />Of course, it's no Love's Savage Secret.<br /><br />The Special Edition DVD's bonus features: audio commentary by retired CIA Field Officer and RED consultant Robert Baer who gives revealing insights regarding the film's plausibility (and implausibility); 10 Deleted & Extended Scenes, including a funny scene which supplements the film's closing moments of Frank and Marvin on a mission in Moldova (00:08:49 minutes long); an optional running RED trivia track in text captions throughout the film: \\"Cast Insights\\" - 14 segments covering topics such as set and location shoots, action sequences, the awesomeness of the cast, and even Helen Mirren's Georgio Armani purse (totaling 00:29:15 minutes); and \\"CIA Exposed\\" - disclosing past, previously secret CIA operations, including one project which focused on experimentation with cats (totaling 00:05:59 minutes).Willis still has the chops to pull of that action leading man role. And, to quote Warren Ellis: \\"Who wouldn't want to see Helen Mirren with a sniper rifle?\\" One of the most amusing tidbits divulged in the special features is that Mirren patterned her assassin character after the immaculate Martha Stewart. Karl Urban, fresh off knocking everyone's socks off as the re-imagined Dr. McCoy in STAR TREK, makes a credible - and even likable - antagonist. More old far+s get dusted off for cameos, such as Ernest Borgnine as the CIA's venerable records keeper and Richard Dreyfuss as a sleazy CEO of a defense contract company.<br /><br />RED, with its brisk cross-country jaunts and its root-for-the-badasss-geriatrics theme and its consistently entertaining beats, is also just off-kiltered enough to make it seem fresh. There's this light capery touch which graces even the film's most generic shoot-'em-up sequences. Given the caliber of the cast, RED would've had to work overtime to stink up the joint. As it is, it certainly made enough of a killing at the box office that a sequel is in the works.<br /><br />Of course, it's no Love's Savage Secret.<br /><br />The Special Edition DVD's bonus features: audio commentary by retired CIA Field Officer and RED consultant Robert Baer who gives revealing insights regarding the film's plausibility (and implausibility); 10 Deleted & Extended Scenes, including a funny scene which supplements the film's closing moments of Frank and Marvin on a mission in Moldova (00:08:49 minutes long); an optional running RED trivia track in text captions throughout the film: \\"Cast Insights\\" - 14 segments covering topics such as set and location shoots, action sequences, the awesomeness of the cast, and even Helen Mirren's Georgio Armani purse (totaling 00:29:15 minutes); and \\"CIA Exposed\\" - disclosing past, previously secret CIA operations, including one project which focused on experimentation with cats (totaling 00:05:59 minutes).
B002ZG980U|5.0|Some directors make a big splash and then slowly fade into the background as successive works become rehashes of their early successes.  George Lucas is a great example of this.  Jumping onto the scene in the late 1970s with Star Wars and then his blockbuster collaborations with Spielberg such as Indiana Jones, he has never won a Best Director award and he now focuses on just and expanding and upgrading his Star Wars Universe.  Ditto with M. Knight Shamalayan.  Then there are the directors that get better with each successive movie, with Christopher Nolan being the best example.  Starting with Memento, then Batman Begins, followed by the Prestige, and The Dark Knight, he has made his crowning achievement with Inception.    Like the original Star Wars, the first and easy sign that this is one of the greatest movies ever made is the difficulty in identifying the genre of this movie.  The movie's title, and astounding and original special effects marks this as a science-fiction movie.  But then again this is not about aliens taking over the world, or machines that rise up against man.  No, this movie is about white-collar crime, corporate crime to be exact.  So then I could say this movie should be mentioned with other classic crime thrillers that feature ensemble casts like Heat, Traffic, or more specifically, Godfather I and II.  To the point, both Inception and the Godfather movies are about a family man involved in crime for the sake of his family.  Now if we look even closer, and recount the most pivotal and important scenes in the movie, we realize this movie is really about a man trying to come to grips with the death of his wife and how he was the cause of it.  This would then make the movie a tragic romance, better than any adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.    Another great feature of this movie is its ability to meld multiple forms of storytelling together.  First, there is the flashback, where the past and the present join together via glimpses of past scenes.For Inception, the flashbacks are of the main character's time with his wife.  Second, we have the story within a story.  For some movies, this might take the form of a personal rivalry occurring within a larger conflict, such as Gandalf vs Saruman in the LOTR movies.  Here, it is the dream within a dream.  Or more specifically, 4 successive dreams within a dream.  Third, there is the concept of parallel story threads that tie together.  In Inception, we have multiple story threads that run in parallel.  There is Ariadne's exploration of Dom's past, Dom dealing with the memories of his wife, the rivalry between the two energy companies that sets the backdrop of the movie, and Dom's desire to return to his children.  All of which are threaded together seamlessly by Christopher Nolan.  Throw in the everything else in the movie, and what you have is a seamless blend of thriller, drama, tragedy, comedy, science fiction, etc... everything except a western.  Add in a captivating soundtrack, great dialog, and a perfect cast, and you come away with possibly the best movie of the new century.  As for the DVD itself, we have the traditional extra features such as interviews with cast members, making-of documentaries, and trailers.  However, there are no deleted or extra scenes on either the regular DVD or Blue-Ray.  This is in keeping with other movies by Christopher Nolan; the movie version is the final and only version.  Overall, worth the buy.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|If you strip away the gaudy colors and all the special effects, you are left with a standard 1950s B-movie sci-fi. The plot is pedestrian good-versus-evil - albeit with a twist - and the dialogue is typically lame Hollywood, set in the future with the same old slang left over from 1940. Even Sigourney Weaver is recycled from a more original genre film: Alien. The twist here is that the US military are the bad guys, and the aliens are the good guys. After that slight difference, all the rest is just kind of campy. There's also a big hole in logic: what happens when the avatars go dead on Pandora while their human counterparts hop out of their fancy transfer beds? What are the Navi doing then? Every so often, the sleeping avatars come back to life as if they had never been away. Huh? Makes no sense, but then we aren't supposed to think too much. Also, how come the Navi's arrows and spears bounce off the military vehicles glass early in the film, but later on are able to pierce the glass during the big end sequence when the Navi win their great victory? Oh well. Despite all, this is a fun film to watch for its state-of-the-art technology, if nothing more.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I saw a few minutes of the Mentalist on TV the first season it was on and thought it was a show I could enjoy. I am not a big watcher of TV, but I noticed the whole series was on DVD and I could not help myself, I purchased it. I have not been disappointed, the shows have been great. The characters are likable, with admirable qualities, and the shows are clean, no nudity or foul language, which I really appreciate. I have really enjoyed the series and plan to buy them as they come out.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an agent working in the field of data acquisition and extraction. However, rather than follow the traditional routes of industrial espionage, he uses cutting-edge technology to extract this information from his targets' dreams. This can be a dangerous task, with the infiltrators at risk from the target's subconscious, but Cobb is the best in his field.    Exiled from the USA for undisclosed reasons, Cobb is desperate to return home and see his children. His latest employer claims that he can make this happen, but only if Cobb can perform the impossible: inception, placing an idea so deeply in the target's subconscious that they believe they came up with it themselves. Cobb has never managed to succeed at this before, but relishes the challenge and the reward. He assembles a team of the very best in their field to mount a reverse-heist into the unconscious of a top businessman, but can he leave his own past behind?    Inception was one of the more heavily-acclaimed movies of 2010, a complex SF thriller helmed by director-of-the-moment Christopher Nolan (The Prestige, The Dark Knight). Its cerebral and complex premise was feared to be off-putting to casual audiences, but the film took an impressive $820 million at the box office and demonstrated that a clever film could still be a break-out hit. At least that's the narrative that's been spread around by various critics. Actually Inception's complexity is more about asking the audience to retain information and maintain a keen eye for detail. The film isn't really ambiguous (aside from a slightly cheesy final shot that screams \\"The End...OR IS IT?!?\\") and the rules of the dream-hacking and details of the heist are pretty well-laid-out by clearly-related expositionary sequences.    Like The Matrix, the film isn't as original as it first appears but melds its ideas with compelling action sequences (a fistfight in a hallway with the exterior gravity switching around is an impressive highlight) and use of CGI (Paris wrapping itself into a giant ball is a staggering visual idea, executed flawlessly). It lacks the confused cod-philosophy of The Matrix's weaker sequels though, instead focusing on the characters of Cobb (a damaged, somewhat arrogant man) and his team-members, particularly Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Eames (Tom Hardy), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Saito (Ken Watanabe) and their mark, Robert Fisher (Cillian Murphy), well-written characters who stand out alongside the film's impressive visuals and more complex ideas.    The film's SF influences are intriguing. Previously Nolan had worked with Christopher Priest on The Prestige and Inception feels very much like a Priest novel reworked to include more explosions and machine guns. The big difference between them is that Priest loves ambiguity whilst Nolan is less interested in leaving open questions, with only the very final shot leaving the story open to further interpretations. The DNA of Philip K. Dick can also be seen in the \\"What is reality?\\" question that pops up throughout the film, not to mention the vast and imposing SF city that we encounter in the final act.    The film falters occasionally. Like The Dark Knight the film occasionally feels weighed down by maybe one or two too many subplots (though vastly less of a problem than on The Dark Knight, which sometimes loses focus as a result of this). Whilst the film has a strong emotional core with regards to Cobb's relationship with his deceased wife and his desire to be reunited with his children, in other areas the film is less emotionally engaging. In particular, the key relationship between Fisher and his father (the late Pete Postlethwaite) never really grabs hold of the imagination.    These are somewhat minor issues, however. Inception (****½) features strong performances, a clever premise and mixes entertainment with thought-provoking ideas. The film is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and in the USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).
0307272702|5.0|Why We Get Fat has solved many personal quandaries for me. I am 48, 5ft 4 and about 140 pounds. Since a teenager, I have tried to be slim. Being obsessed with food is an annoying waste of time, but I was always thinking about what I would cook and eat. After reading Why We Get Fat I decided to try eating more meat and protein, and I found an immediate turn around. Before, I would cook healthy foods, large salads, and meals with little meat and no processed foods, preferring to bulk up on vegetables and whole grains. These meals were very \\"healthy,\\" but I still obsessed about food. Once I inverted the porportions of protein to non-protein, I found myself thinking about food much less. food had  been my main preoccupation, fgortunately for me that no longer is true.     It's only been 2 weeks, but since Ive allowed myself to 'indulge' in as much meat and high protein foods as I desire, I feel as though my relationship with food is much more easy going. And, its not as though I am eating tons of meat either, I have been very surprised at that as well, though I have given myself permission to eat as much meat as I would like, i find that Im less hungry for it.     I was never a junk food lover, or a fast food lover but even so, I thought I was giving my body all that it needed yet I was always obsessed with food. I still like to cook, but since I have inverted the emphasis, no longer restricting protein & meat, I am more relaxed and have just as much energy and I don't think constantly about my next meal.   Now, is it healthy to eat as Gary sugggests? I read the China Study a few years back. This book suggests that statistically it appears that a high protein diet is the cause of many Western ills since the Chinese people in the study had few such illnesses and ate a very low protein diet including no milk. I would suggest that diets of traditional Chinese vs typical Westerner are different on many levels, for one that Westerners, especially Americans, eat far more processed foods, and the culprits causing these illnesses could be in the food processing chain rather than the basic building blocks of that diet. Also, while exercise in Gary's book is countraindicated for weight loss, it is certainly a means of maintaining a well functioning body and one would think Chinese peasants are probably eating less in general and 'working out' more, though not at the gym.     Finally, seen from an epigenetic point of view Gary's ideas shine light on the incredible  increases in obesity. We are witnessing the second generation of the obesity epidemic: kids are fatter earlier in life because heavy women with insulin intolerance create large babies with a tendency to get and remain obese. Its going to be even harder to prevent a future where 75% of the popluation is obese, but that's where we are headed when these kids grow up and start having their own families. Clearly the food pyramid with its outsized regard for carbohydrates has not been working, but could actually be upside down?     The question isnt if Gary's ideas are wrong, the question is that his ideas may be right, and we cannot afford to keep going down the same road while people, mostly lower income, less well educated people, get heavier and less healthy with each passing generation. the question is we are at a 'try anything point,' so how can we get good healthy protein to the masses? After all, the USA depends on corn and wheat, with huge subsidies that support the lives of rural farmers and the vast fast food industries and chain grocery stores - we cannot just stop all that over night. yet all meat products are expensive in comparison, even at MacDonalds the hamburger bun is not exactly where the bulk of your fast food money budget is going, try putting two 'all beef patties' on the outside and a sliver of prefab \\"bread\\" on the inside and you will triple the price!  Im not advocating the wholesale slaughter of cows and pigs either. thats already happening, and its not exaclty working. What needs to occur is a means to get healthy protein, even if it is plant based protein, cheaply and safely to everyone and then see what kind of effect that has on the countries overall health rate, and to do this while continuing to emphasize eating less processed foods and avoiding junk food. After all, to quote the lottery, you never know. Sometimes the answers are that simple. The food pyramid got it backwards. maybe we will find such an approach has some unexpected consequences. Drastically changing the balance of protein and carbs and the subsequent shock to hormones may act on other mysterious epidemics of the late 20th century like autism. One can only hope.

B0043GN6XU|5.0|For an opera that is alleged to be one of Verdi's more unpopular operas, Simon Boccanegra has garnered more DVD's than one could have assumed. Of course, part of this interest is the result of Domingo's desire to sing the role. A number of houses invited the tenor to sing the role there and Domingo accepted. Two of those houses have now provided us with the documentation of the great tenor singing a great Verdi Baritone role.    When PBS telecast the Met investiture I listened/watched with curiosity. Domingo sang like Domingo, neither tenor nor baritone. It did seem as if, however, there appeared to be a lack of power that one associates with the role but it couldn't be denied that the voice was in healthy condition without a hint of wobble or poor intonation. Still I remained convinced that this assumption was questionable. What I did not question were other principals in the cast. James Morris who has given long servce to the Met and has been replaced in Wagner roles was singing Fiesco. Unwise move. Added to his CV this document will not add luster to his career (most of his roles in the Italian rep have been undistinguished). He is afflicted with a wobble and the experience of hearing his Il lacerato spirito was painful. Like many older listeners and those curious in the history of singing will have heard Kipnis' recording of this aria. It was a benchmark and remains so. I do not know if it is available on YouTube, but search it out. A soprano whom I have (and still do) admired, Adrianne Pieczonka, was the Amelia. Either the role is uncongenial or she was in poor voice on the day of the taping; it was distressing to hear her laboring to to sing the music, notably the opening aria. Adorno was Marcello Giordani. I confess that I have never heard this man sing a role that made me want to hear more of him. I find the sound leathery, uniniflected and worst of all unmusical. Adorno is not the tenor role of one's dreams but he participates in duets and ensembles and iscritical. Then there is the production: I suppose one either likes it or doesn't. For an opera set in Genoa it makes no attempt to convey the geography; it is claustrophobic and lacking in any sense of location. Indeed, I suspect that it could be interchanged with a number of operas.    The EMI set on the other hand is superior in all the aspects that I have cited above. Domingo is still Domingo but he sings with a greater freedom and more power than in New York. The ROH production is, if not the last word, preferable to del Monaco's in its openness; it fails only in the great Council Chamber scene. The Amelia, Marina Poplavskaya, has created a great deal of controversy in New York with her Violetta in the Willy Decker production of Traviata. ROH is a house that has welcomed her in Don Giovanni, Don Carlo, (both the premiere and the revival) and Simon Boccanegra. She is in good voice and I have enjoyed her singing with its youthful freshness and dramatic commitment; I wish that her Italian were better, but she is an appealing presence, notably in the great father-daughter duet in Act I. She is also a wonderful Desdemona in a Salzburg Otello conducted by Muti. Furlanetto is the Fiesco and while he may not erase memories of Kipnis, he is a marvel--the Italian equivalent of Matti Salimen, two artists who have retained their voices after decades of singing. Indeed Furlanetto appears to improve as the opera progressed. Pappano and his orchestra bring a vigor and enthusiasm to the performance that really conconvinces you that his truly is one of Verdi's great works.    Calleja is the Adorno and in every way he is superior to Giordano. To begin with his musical instincts are greater, his sensitivity, his sense of light and shade all combine to make the role more interesting. It is interesting to note that in the thirties, the role was sung by Martinelli: in one of the early LP recordings the role was sung by Giuseppe Campora, a lyric tenor who also sang Fenton. I don't think that this is a \\"one size fits all\\"  role, but Calleja's lyric voice is not compromised in any way and is very good--even when compared to Domingo's own assumption of the role in the Met's second DVD.    My only criticism is the casting of Jonbathan Summers as Paolo. I assume that Summers is a house artist and have no doubt that he is as important to ROH as Charles Anthony was to the Met. Vocally he leaves something to be desired. The role is not large but it is an important one. If one goes back to the era of 78's and checks out the old RCA catalogue you can find a Chamber Council scene with Tibbett, Martinelli, Bampton and Leonard Warren as Paolo. In those days it was not uncommon to find Paolo a stepping stone to the role of Boccanegra. Unfortunately that would appear to be a tradition that has passed on and the only Paolo on DVD who could conceivably step up in rank is Mario Vratogna in the Arthaus DVD. Obviously this is not a deal breaker in deciding to choose a DVD but surely ROH could have done better.

B000002ILG|5.0|In the late 80s, heavy metal was a very hazy concept, since any music that featured guitars recorded with a slightly overdriven tone and played with a modicum of technical expertise was marketed under that umbrella, thanks in no small part to the genre's three pronged (via its thrash, traditional and hair subgenres) commercial success. On this context, White Lion stands out among even the lightest of the pop metal bands.<br />Formed by pretty boy singer Mike Tramp, who had a previous career as a teen idol in the 70s on his native Denmark with the band Mabel, and Vito Bratta, your typical Long Island guitar virtuoso, the band struggled with many different lineups until finally settling with James Lomenzo on bass and Greg D'angelo on drums.<br />Their 1987 major label debut, Pride, went platinum on the strength of its lead single Wait and the ballad When the Children Cry, both Top Ten hits, yet the band couldn't keep its success on their next two albums and disbanded acrimoniously in 1991.<br />Unlike most of their hair brethren, this was a band composed of extremely talented musicians who never fell for the common rock clich&eacute; of recording blatantly commercial, radio friendly singles and then claiming that they were a much heavier band live.<br />Both Bratta and Tramp, the band's songwriting team, were big fans of pretty pop music targeted to female teenagers who just used hair metal, the most popular rock style of their time, to get their music careers ahead, but unlike more cynical musicians they tried to push the genre's rather limited envelope and never forgot to infuse their albums with impeccable songwriting, sweet melodies, challenging guitar solos, elegant arrangements and intelligent or truly heartfelt lyrics that went beyond the usual decadent rock 'n roll decadence tropes. Hard to believe? Just check Lady of the Valley for a crash course on all the elements that made this group so unique back in the day.<br />So, even if this is a band that ultimately thrived on hair metal, these girly wimps deserve a lot more recognition that they ultimately got, since they always showed true love and respect for their chosen genre, something this style's more successful practitioners like Poison, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Winger and Warrant would demonstrate to sorely lack after a little track named Smells Like Teen Spirit changed the music business forever in late 1991.<br />Aside from the usual hair metal dinosaurs and cougars still into this stuff, smart pop music enthusiasts and Elton John or Billy Joel fans who ever wondered what they would've sounded like if had they taken up guitar instead of piano as kids should check out this album.<br />Useless Metal Trivia Note: Yes, Greg D'angelo is that Greg D'angelo, the original Anthrax drummer.

B002ZG980U|5.0|I saw this movie on the IMAX theater when it first came out and it was absolutely stunning!  To see it again on DVD on my flat TV was still satisfying -- and I get the added benefit of watching how the movie was made in the DVD's Special Features selection.  Everything works for this movie - the visual effect, the directing, the acting, the editing, etc, etc.  There never was a dull moment from beginning to end.  How it is that Christopher Nolan was NOT nominated for the Best Director category, and Leonardo DiCaprio NOT nominated for the Best Actor category, I'll never know.  (Well, at least Nolan got nominated for the Best Original Screenplay category.)  What I do know is that this movie works.  Beyond the visual effect, the movie was thought provoking.  Highly recommended!

0553381687|5.0|George RR Martain did something amazing with this series. He made me realize not every idea had been used up in this genre. I read Tolkein when i was in high school and had a feeling every time i read any fantasy book that the author was just regurgitating a formula which Tolkein had already done. Even some considered to be great authors of fantasy....say Robert Jordan for example. Martain truely did something new and fresh. He made a unique fantasy world that is interesting even to non fantasy readers. He is also a master of craft. I think one of the most difficult things for an author to acheive is switching between characters in a large encompassing world and having it not be confusing and not seem contrived. As though painting a literary picture in this way actually makes sense. His characters all go though a journey during the series.....but unlike Tolkein,Jordan...ect.ect it's not a literal journey i have to read about for a million boring pages of characters being \\"On the road\\" It's a journey of growth and learning in the characters own mind....you end up both loving and hating almost every character at some point in the series. Very human....and when characters feel human...it makes it easy to become invested inthem. I can't say enough to recommend reading this series rather you are a fan of fantasy...or just of dramtic literature.

030746363X|5.0|When I read The 4-Hour Workweek for the first time, I dismissed it as simply unrealistic. I re-read it and was inspired to try it. And while I am not quite down to 4 hours a week, I have followed many of Tim's recommendations and it changed my life. So when The 4-Hour Body was getting ready to be published, I pre-ordered my autographed copy and forgot about it. When we came back from our Christmas \\"vacation\\" and visit with my in-laws in Germany, I was tipping the scales at 225 pounds. Ugh. That was my starting weight on 1/1/11. That week, I began assiduously following the chapters in The 4-Hour Body (4HB) on fat loss and weight management. In the first week, results were ... well, negligible. I'd seen better progress on the South Beach Diet. In the second week, some progress. Down from 225 to around 217. But fast forward to today (1/30/11) and I am at 202 pounds, or a difference of 23 pounds in a month. That in and of itself is motivating, and the fact that my energy level is up, I am able to get back into clothes I haven't worn in 3-4 years, etc. etc. makes it so worth it. Thank you Tim for another awesome and outlandish book. It is worth every penny!!!

B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Band of Brothers was better. The people who made this series worked very hard I'm sure. I compliment them for that. However, if you do not have familiarity with the WWII Pacific war, you will find this hard to follow. Band of Brother followed one unit for a shorter duration of the war. The Pacific has to cover a longer time frame with three different soldiers. A big piece of history to bite off. Band of Brothers also focused on the combat unit not the home front. The home front aspect of this series I found wandering and drawn out too much. I wish I could rate this higher but I cannot.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|It is 99.9% per silver which is one of the best heat transfer compounds on the market. When I buy a CPU that is preloaded from the factory, I clean it off and apply Arctic Silver.It's cheap insurance. That little tube has enough product to prep at least 10 CPU's.And its inexpensive too!
B001PKHS68|4.0|Hitchcock's 1955 charmer TO CATCH A THIEF sits squarely in the middle of his most polished, prolific decade in Hollywood.  It's also his most unusual film, as the crime caper element of the story constantly takes a backseat to the romantic comedy interplay of it's two stars, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.<br /><br />Cary Grant stars as John Robie, a retired former jewel thief known as \\"The Cat\\".  When a copycat thief (no pun intended) starts plundering the safes and jewelry-boxes of every self-respecting millionairess on the French Riviera, John goes undercover to clear his reputation - and catch the true culprit.  Stationing himself at the Hotel Carlton, John meets vacationing American heiress Francie Stevens (Grace Kelly) and her charming mother (Jessie Royce Landis).  Suddenly John's job becomes even harder, for whilst he pursues the thief who is intent to destroy his life, Francie's ardent pursuit of John could set the entire operation into a tailspin!<br /><br />Sparkling Edith Head costumes, shimmering location photography and a witty screenplay all conspire to make TO CATCH A THIEF one of Hitch's most unusual and beloved movies.  With tongue firmly planted in cheek, Kelly and Grant also generate their own fireworks in the oft-referenced \\"hotel seduction\\" scene.  Jessie Royce Landis would again play mother to Kelly the following year in \\"The Swan\\"; and the cast also features John Williams, Brigitte Auber, Charles Vanel and Jean Martinelli.<br /><br />It's a delicious holiday on the Riviera coast when you join Grace Kelly and Cary Grant in TO CATCH A THIEF.  Extra features include audio commentary with Peter Bogdanovich and Laurent Bouzereau, several new featurettes (\\"Writing and Casting...\\", \\"The Making of...\\", \\"Alfred Hitchcock: An Appreciation\\", and \\"Edith Head: The Paramount Years\\"); and the trailer.
B003O86CJS|3.0|This CD arrived very quickly and sounds great. The songs \\"Teenage Dream\\" and \\"California Girls\\" were the ones I bought this CD for, and they are excellent. I'm very pleased with this CD for that reason, since those were the two songs I was always hearing in the stores I shopped in.    However, I had previously noticed there were two versions of this CD. I ordered the \\"Clean\\" version because I didn't hear anything bad in the stores I shopped in. I've never heard the original disc, so I don't know what was so bad about it, but my current theory is that the \\"clean\\" version I ordered is NOT \\"edited\\" in a quality way.    For example, rather than \\"editing\\" words or \\"swapping\\" words that might be bad, there is one song where LITERALLY the first 1 minute (over 60 seconds) is NOT THERE AT ALL!!! My theory is that since this entire one minute section is missing in this version of the CD, it must have had some stuff that didn't belong in the \\"clean version\\" of the CD. Leaving out an entire 60 second period of music -- or lack thereof -- is an AWFUL way of releasing a \\"clean\\" version of a song. The first several times I tried listening to this song, I thought it wasn't there at all. Only after a minute passed did the sound start up.    I have absolutely no personal singing ability at all, but based on this business model I could become a millionaire by releasing a version of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star filled with a LOT of swear words, and then selling a \\"clean\\" version filled with 60 minutes of absolutely NOTHING! All it would be is a clock ticking by for an hour, with no sound at all. That's pretty much what you get for the first 60 seconds of that one song. That reason alone is why I'm rating this CD 3 stars instead of 5 stars.
0306812835|4.0|This book is interesting in that the author talks a great deal about structures in nature and not only the usual steel structures.  He was insightful and really helped the reader understand how structures actually work.  Math was sparse and not intensive but that is what the average reader is looking for.  The small passages in some of the chapters that contained old literature quotations I found less than useful, but he did a good job tying them into the topic at hand.  Overall it is a good read, recommended.
1594202842|1.0|I agree with conservative columnist David Brooks.  She went way way over the top.  In the meshuganah mom's zeal to make her kids like her, she not only made their childhoods very unpleasant but deprived them of the opportunity to socialize, develop as human beings and to make choices for themselves.
B0040PYVTW|5.0|I don't know how I haven't heard of this guy earlier. I'm thankful to you Amazon. Keep stuff like this coming. It's just great music. This music reminds me of old records and it's so good I would have worn out the record.I'm glad technology has improved...
B000255LIY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I don't know when I've seen much better acting than Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart.  They are both superb.  And the movie itself has always been one of my favorites.  I remember watching the older version with Katherine Hepburn with my mom when i was younger.
B003L20ICE|5.0|The other reviews, for good or ill, have gone over the plot and in that regard I have nothing to add. I just wanted to say that the characters feel like real people. They aren't cliches, but human beings with faults who sometimes make the wrong choices. If only more viewing experiences were this rewarding with characters you believe.
B000089QEN|5.0|This movie is great!  It is funny, and real, and ridiculous, and shows all different and varying sides of humans and their quirky natures, from the silly to the tragic.  I have always loved the book, and I think the movie stays admirably true to the book - the actors have been chosen with good taste as well!  Very good movie.  I recommend.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|imagine that one day u wake up brainwashed on a bus. u dont know anything, your name, where your from, and everything else. then u fight some monsters and almost die by lightning....        to understand this book, u need to first read the percy jackson seris which i recomend u to read. i also recomend u to read this book!!!!!   :)
0385341679|5.0|Shadowfever by Karen Marie Moning is a very satisfying and surprising conclusion to the Fever series. I read Dreamfever first on the advice of a co-worker, then started the series from the beginning (to catch up), then read Shadowfever. What impressed me the most was the way Ms. Moning evolves her characters as the series progresses. I must admit that I didn't care for Mac (our ingenue)in the beginning--typical bubble-head heroine, I thought---but after following her progression, I realized she was painted this way on purpose, to really let the events in the books change and mold her (sometimes very violently) into the powerful, toughened (but still flawed) person she is to become. Without giving spoilers, I was also pleased that Ms. Monings' characters are allowed to be flawed heroes--and that no one characers' fate is set in stone. Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen in Shadowfever, each time I was sure I knew who each character was and what role they would play in the conclusion, Ms. Moning would turn the world on it's head (sometimes literally) and reveal hidden motivations, depths, and deaths(!)I was totally unprepared for. Extra star for not taking the easy way out with the story, and keeping me guessing. Great read, and well worth the wait!    Caveat: It is almost imperative to read the first books in this series first to grasp all of the plot twists and clues that were built in over the first four books. It is well worth doing for this great wrap up!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I missed the the first season and only started watching this during the beginning of the second season.  I have become addicted to this show.  You can watch the video over & over again and not get bored.  I can't wait for the entire second season to come out!! If you have become a Gleek like me you will love this video!!
B003U9V6A6|5.0|There are many bands out n' about today that you almost get lost in counting. However there are very few who are actually worth listening to. The Script hasn't been in the spot light for long and this is just their second album but I think we'll be hearing from these guys more often in the future. After the release of songs like 'Breakeven', 'Live Like Where Dying' (Yup No offense Kris Allen Fans but this song is originally sang but The Script) and 'The Man Who Can't Be Moved' from their first debut album, this album comes as a 'pleasant surprise' and with even better lyrics.<br /><br />1- \\"For The First Time\\" : So you think the title suites a love song huh ? Think again, this song is actually about the Economical Depression in Ireland. Which makes it all the better along with the beautiful Lyrics, its one of my personal favorite :) 5/5<br /><br />2-\\"You Wont' Feel A Thing\\" : This song has a catchy intro to it. Though I can't say its one of my favorite on this album but still a good song nether less ! Worth listening to 3.5/5<br /><br />3- \\"Nothing\\" : The Poor guy is going through a breakup trying to forget his love he knows he's better without her but even \\"a few drinks\\" can't seem to make him forget her. Beautiful Song, really touching and another personal favorite 5/5<br /><br />4- \\"Science & Faith\\" : The song that the album's titled after. Pretty much a comparison between a Scientist's POV and a Believer's POV and their outlook on Love/Life etc.. A Great Song, really beautiful lyrics and Unique ! Another personal favorite 5/5<br /><br />5- \\" If You Ever Come Back\\" : Suffering the aftermath of a bad breakup, Your Lover just break it off with you and you can't seem to let go ? This song is for you ! It's all about asking forgiveness and wanting another chance and just simply starting over. Once again Beautiful Lyrics, Great Song. One of my personal Favorite ! 5/5<br /><br />6- \\" Long Gone And Moved On\\" : It may have been months or even years but he just can't seem to get over his ex however that's all about to change because today he's finally moving On and leaving the memories behind. Very Well Written, A touching song and kinda sad. One of my personal Favorite 5/5<br /><br />7- \\"Dead Man Walking\\" : Beautiful Song, Beautiful Lyrics ( I told you the lyrics in this album are just Incredible) Once again the Science/Faith theme is implied in here and the result is well quite frankly beautiful ! 4.5/5<br /><br />8- \\" Walk Away\\" : Catchy Song, A little bit different from The other songs in this album. But its quite refreshing, this is the closest it'll ever get to fast-paced songs in this album which is by the standards of modern days R and B, Pop etc.. is slow but if you bought this album then I guess you wouldn't mind that ! 4.5/5<br /><br />9- \\"This=Love\\" : What is Love ? This song tries to explain that. Great Lyrics ! Has kinda of a Slow R n B verse towards the end.  Vampire Diaries used this song in one of their episodes. A Personal Favorite 5/5<br /><br />10- \\"Exit Wounds\\" : A Great conclusion ! About letting your wounds out and just relaxing ! Another Good Song 4.5/5<br /><br />Note: I know that there is a (Deluxe Version) released with extra songs just recently However I didn't review them because I didn't buy the Deluxe Version but that doesn't mean that these are all the songs that this album has to offer.<br /><br />To Put it in one word this album has been \\"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G\\" ! The Lyrics are Beautiful, the songs have meanings to them and the singers are talented ! This is more than I would ask for in an Album, I normally don't Buy an entire album because I rarely like ALL the songs included, However this album has been an exception ! Its just one of those Albums who you can play over and over again and it never gets old and you don't really have to skip to the better songs because all the songs are worth listening to. I personally played it constantly for like a month. So if there was just One album that you could buy inthis year I would recommend you pick this album up ! Believe the reviews, what you see is what you get :)<br /><br /> Irish Bands with similar songs I would recommend :<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004RHZM Westlife]]what you get :)      Irish Bands with similar songs I would recommend :     [[ASIN:B00004RHZM Westlife]]
0553382179|5.0|I love this book and the FlyLady system. She has really helped me out and it's so great to have a calm house. What's amazing is... How EVERYONE has just automatically chimed in to help!!!

B002ZGW9KG|5.0|Stephen King opines in his non-fiction book [[ASIN:1439170983 DANSE MACABRE]] that WAIT UNTIL DARK is the scariest movie of all time and that Alan Arkin's performance \\"may be the greatest evocation of screen villainy ever.\\"<br /><br />WAIT UNTIL DARK was originally a Frederick Knott play (he also wrote [[ASIN:B0002HOEQ2 DIAL M FOR MURDER]]) that opened on Broadway 2/2/66 and closed on New Year's Eve after 373 performances. It starred Lee Remick and Robert Duvall (as the villain). Julie Herrod reprised her role of young Gloria for the movie version.<br /><br />In a straightforward adaptation directed by Terence Young that's set in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village, Miss Hepburn is a recently blinded woman victimized by demented Arkin, whose Lenny Bruce impression here surely was picked up on by Dustin Hoffman when he portrayed Ratso Rizzo in [[ASIN:B000CRQX3E MIDNIGHT COWBOY]] two years later. In this taut thriller, Crenna and Weston are Arkin's partners in crime.<br /><br />The three bad guys that come to Susy's apartment to search for a drug-filled child's doll take advantage of her good nature and blindness. They visit one at a time, pretending to be a cop, an old man and his son and a friend of Susy's husband (Zimbalist), who'd recently returned from a Montreal trip carrying a doll that was given to him at the airport by a woman he'd never seen before.<br /><br />Now that mysterious lady is dead, murdered by the homicidal \\"Roat,\\" who first eliminates his two inept partners and then targets Susy. By this point however she's on to his game and although sightless is able to fight back with effectiveness. Their final terrifying scene together is unforgettable!<br /><br />This is a classic fright film, one devoid of special effect trickery, that's all the more effective because it plays out like real life. Don't miss it!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.9) Wait Until Dark (1967) - Audrey Hepburn/Alan Arkin/Richard Crenna/Efrem Zimbalist Jr./Jack Weston/Samantha Jones/Julie Herrod (uncredited: Robby Benson/Mel Ferrer-voice)k Weston/Samantha Jones/Julie Herrod (uncredited: Robby Benson/Mel Ferrer-voice)
B000ZN802W|1.0|Okay if you want to be tortured by watching a spoiled/lazy/self indulgent/pouting college boy and listen to narration by his spoiled/mom and dad you're so mean for treating us well/  pain in the neck sister-then..this is your movie.  If I raised kids like these two I'd be really depressed-I kept thinking as I watched and listened to these two spoiled brats---how would they like to be born into poverty-and have no help at all and have to fight and claw their way up and out of poverty. This is a good example of what happens when you give kids too much; they appreciate nothing.  The main character is so self righteous....so preachy -and like he knows anything?  The only good thing about the movie was the scenery-it's pretty---but the movie stinks and the characters are all a bunch of self absorbed nit-wits.  Bleeechhh....I hope they all go into the wild and ...stay there.
0399226907|2.0|Yes it is cute, etc, etc.  Frankly I am a little annoyed of how quickly it can be read...not particularly engaging for any length of time
B0034G4P7Q|1.0|Most of the scenes were hardly believable like the programmers going out and having a drink at the bar and being all \\"cool\\". I have never met programmers as \\"cool\\". What about the fine asian girl in the movie? I only see those types after the nerd gets millions and see bill gates for an example.  This is like a bad science fiction novel mixed with non-fictional characters. Why not create a movie based on Napster that might sound a bit more exciting.....well sort of.
0143039431|5.0|I started \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" over two months ago because my book club assigned it. People warned me it would be dull and difficult to read. I read two chapters and put it down. But I wouldn't let myself read anything else because I have a rule that once I start a book, I have to finish it before starting another. Finally picked it back up and I'm so glad I did. What a magnificent novel! I'll never take food for granted again.
B0045ODPKY|3.0|\\"Salt\\" is named after the character played in this film by Angelina Jolie.  It is not too much to say that this film appears to have been essentially designed to showcase Jolie's great looks and ability to carry off a non-stop action film.  The action in this film starts early and never ends.  The action scenes are well-done and exciting.  Of course, the trade-off is that to a significant extent the action comes at the sacrifice of more plot and character development.<br /><br />All that having been said, this film does have an interesting storyline; something of a \\"Charm School\\" theme for my fellow Nelso DeMille fans.  Without giving much of anything away (very minor spoiler) the plot here is that the Cold War Soviets have infiltrated the USA with Russian sleeper agents who were trained from childhood to pass as Americans.  Needless to say they are up to no good.  And therein lies the basic story of this film.<br /><br />My whole family enjoyed watching \\"Salt\\" and it is certainly good enough, and nuanced enough, to justify watching more than once.  Recommended.  RJB.
B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|I love Celine Dion's music, and with this DVD you get it all. This is a big production Vagas style for sure. DVD is clear good sound. Too many wide shots for my tast. Some songs I did not know, huge stage so that even on DVD she looked small, like I did not have very good seats. Over all I liked it
0307454541|5.0|Part thriller, part suspense and add in a little social injustice...  This baby was a page turner for sure!
B003HI3MSE|5.0|That's how I'll describe how I came across this album.  I knew \\"Alone\\" and \\"Scream Aim Fire,\\" but those were the only songs I had ever heard. I decided for $7.00 it was worth a chance on this album.      For amost a year now, I've been thoroughly entertained.  I even found a few new favorites.  \\"Your Betrayal,\\" \\"Begging for Mercy\\" and \\"Pretty on the Outside\\" are pretty decent.  Just the right amount of screaming and hard guitar rifs to make this a metal album.    I wouldn't classify myself as hardcore metal, as I only like stuff from Avenged Sevenfold from City of Evil and after, and Death Magnetic is my favorite Metallica album.  Take this review from a casual fan and decide if you want to buy the album.
030745455X|4.0|Loved \\"Tattoo\\" and loved the second book as well.  Stayed up way too late and got up way too early to keep reading!  :-)
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|My heart was beating the entire movie and I jumped a few times. With the clues they give you to figure out who is doing the killing I found myself going back and forth with suspects and why, but I was not right. Its an intence movie that comes together at the end and the reasons these horrible thing happened. Loved it
B004DK49DW|4.0|Let me start by saying that I really like this cd, but it's really just another Mike Ness solo record and should NOT be labeled as a Social Distortion album. Being originally from Orange County, I grew up listening to and seeing Social D from the very beginning. Social Distortion were PUNK ROCK, there is NOTHING punk rock about this cd. This record for the most part is very country orientated and very bluesy, all the way down to the soul filled backing vocals on a couple tracks (something Social Distortion would have never done years ago). And yeah, I realize Mike is pushing 50 and his musical direction has changed, but keep that labeled as a \\"Mike Ness Project\\" and not a Social Distortion release. And since he's the only real member of Social D and all the songs were written by him, it technically is a Mike Ness solo record.  I promise, I'm not hating. I really love this cd, and highly recommend it if your a fan of Mike Ness. But if you're looking for a punk rock Social Distortion record.....this isn't it.
B00005JLD4|4.0|This movie takes place in Australia where a fence is being built across the continent.  It is the story about the Jigalong Mob or Desert people that are losing their identity to white settlers.  The white settlers take kids and babies from their parents so they can be taught the ways of the real world.  A man named Mr. Neville is put in charge of the aborigines' people and his plan is to breed them with white settlers so they can eventually become white.  In the movie, kids are called half-caste if one of their parents was white.  The kids are sent to a camp and two of them, Molly and Daisy ran way and escaped twice.  The movie didn't spend much time on the camp but it would have been nice to see the daily routines of it and more ways that the kids had to convert.  Most of the movie is about the girl's passage back home.         The movie was moving and heart breaking.  I was surprised how smart the Jigalong Mob was with hunting and losing their tracks techniques and how they can survive some pretty harsh conditions.  It taught me a lot about the ways of another culture such as honoring a spirit like the eagle they called the Spirit Bird.  Towards the end, there was a scene where a group of women were chanting and I'm convinced it was to bring the kids home safely.  It was heartbreaking to watch the kids being separated from their parents and they were not allowed to speak their own language in the camp.  It must be terrifying to be taken away and sent to a place where you had to go to church, not understand the language, make a bed, and other things you're not accustomed to.       The original description didn't reflect the real plot of the movie and the movie could have reflected more on the fence.  I think the fence symbolized a border between white settlers and the Australian Mob or Indigenous (specific or native to a particular region) people verses the modern world.
B004856SQ8|4.0|This isn't high art nor will it make you exam your station in life, but as far as a popcorn flick this movie delivers in spades. Every member of the cast delivers memorable performances of your favorite characters without doing imitations. The action is over the top just as you'd expect, and despite my love hate relationship with Jessica Beil, she does a beleivable job as the tough agent. Fun is the flavor of this movie, and you get more than enough scoops.
0553381687|3.0|I was referred to this book from a fellow epic fantasy fan and, having not previously read anything by Martin, was excited about the prospect of a new trilogy to keep me occupied.  After reading Game of Thrones, however, I do not think I will continue with the sequels.  It *was* a well-written book, albeit difficult at times to keep track of all of the new and similarly named characters thrown into the story in short intervals. But quite simply, I just didn't find the story interesting.  As the name suggests, Game of Thrones is all political and describes how several boring and relatively undifferentiated Houses are embroiled in political intrigue. I thought I would rely on the history of these Houses to add bulk to the story, but those potentially interesting tidbits just weren't there if sufficient quantity.  If I wasn't entertained by the main host of characters, I thought perhaps I could focus on the World instead.  But unfortunately that arena was disappointing as well.  The world is relatively small and there is very little (with one exception) differentiation between inhabitants of each region of the world. Descriptions about varying areas are shallow and makes it difficult for the reader to paint a real mental image about the characters' surroundings. I also enjoy a healthy dose of magic in my epic fantasy reads.  Though Game of Thrones constantly hints at it, nothing substantially materializes.<br /><br />On a positive note, I did really enjoy how the book was organized into different points of view.  That made the story engaging and allowed me to understand the characters fully.<br /><br />It wasn't a bad read, just not the read for me.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|This 3D movie decorated with high effect,great for Surround sound.  The story is less interesting & for 3D is just right,specially  when all the shooting are started.  enjoy the movie.
0316078913|2.0|For the record:  I love, love, love David Sedaris.  But this collection not only fell short...it completely missed its mark.  The book begins with a humorous, self-deprecating story about his experience as a Macy's Christmas elf.  It was the warm and familiar style I so enjoy about this author.  The anecdotes that followed were dark, cold, and insensitive.  Not all were autobiographical, which is unfortunate since Sedaris' personal stories have always been part of the charm.  Maybe he was experimenting with a new genre; perhaps he was just finding his personal style.  His other work is so good that he can be forgiven.
B004KPQK2S|2.0|Hollywood tries really hard to create drama and build the story around Peggy Tweedy, the 'housewife' turned horse breeder. But it's a forced effort at best. Diane Lane is stiff and John Malcovich horribly miscast. The horses did a better job of acting than any of the humans. It's sentimental, predictable, and boring. \\"Seabiscuit,\\" this ain't.
B000002KHB|5.0|In Rock, Fireball, and now this. Machine Head is one of the greatest albums ever created from Deep Purple. Every single song is almost close to perfection. The fast-paced \\"Highway Star\\" and \\"Pictures of Home\\" are prime examples of the band's undeniable lyrical/musical talents. \\"Maybe I'm a Leo,\\" my personal favorite from the album, is musical bliss from beginning to end. \\"Smoke on the Water,\\" one of the most famous classic songs ever produced, is rightfully considered to be a definite masterpiece. \\"Lazy\\" is mostly instrumental, but it gives pure listening pleasure. \\"Never Before\\" and the closer \\"Space Truckin'\\" shouldn't be left out: both are great songs.<br /><br />I don't think the music of today will survive in forty years or so, but the music of Deep Purple will surely live on. Their music is genuinely timeless, and will forever survive along with Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Creedence Clearwater Revival, etc.<br /><br />Grade: 10/10
B004FEFZU2|2.0|Got this DVD today and watched it.  Movie was OK, but the DVD version was sadly lacking.  The best parts - the making of the traps and other special features - are on the Blu-Ray version ONLY.  Since I do not have a blu-ray player, I don't get to see them?  The marketers of this combo pack must also have a hand in blu-ray sales.  Very disappointed.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|The wonderful Albert Finney brings an excellent performance as John Newton, but the script has him altogether wrong.  The \\"guilt-ridden penitent monk\\" might have been a good script device, but it isn't at all what Newton was like.  He was an excellent preacher with a strong reputation, he reveled in God's grace and the assurance of his forgiveness.  Wish they could have done a fairer job for the forgiven old slave trader, especially since they purloined his hymn for the title -- which now makes it hard for anyone to use the title for a movie ABOUT Newton, a story that is fantastically dramatic and begs to be turned into a film.
0470638842|5.0|I purchased this book over a year ago...and promised Erik I would write a review.  The book review never made it to the top of my to-do list until today.  I just re-read the book and was inspired to give Erik the kudos he deserves.      Socialnomics just makes sense!  Erik explains why having a web presence is important to growing your business or just staying in touch with the people that are important to you.  I encourage you to pick this one up.  A quick and great read.      Sorry it took me so long, Erik.  You still ROCK!
B00011CZRE|1.0|I saw this movie a couple times, and I liked it as a scary movie on a rainy day or whatever.... it's just that, I know too many people who take this stuff seriously. It's filled with Christian or more specifically Catholic, mythology - the seven deadly \\"sins\\" Lust, Vanity, Gluttony, Pride, Wrath, Sloth and Greed. It's basically a vigilante who goes around killing people in horrific manners as a punishment for their \\"sins.\\" It has a surprise ending which was cleverly thought out more or less, but innocents suffered at this guy's hands and the plot doesn't really make sense. In no way does it make moral sense. First of all, Catholics practice child sacrifice and torture and enslave women, which does not qualify them as the best moral judges. The bible in itself is tyrannical and abusive, as well as chock full of lunacy - not the reasoned judge I'd want making decisions on my moral life that's for sure.     Also this guy does not really mete out justice. A person guilty of gluttony, sloth or vanity, does not deserve death, not even in the Catholic church and they loooove to kill and torture people. Usually, you go to confession and say a Hail Mary or two. I think the psycho in this movie was just looking for an excuse to kill people and get his pic in the paper, or whatever, and con a bunch of suckers into thinking he was some underground hero instead of what he was - a cruel psychotic, not-very-bright, jerk. Actually I have a lot of compassion for people who mess up in life, controlling the worst of your nature is difficult, most people mess up often on all counts - and Catholics can be overly critical - not to mention psychotic - about details anyway. You really have to know a person's whole life to know what they are. Maybe that guy was injured and gained weight because he couldn't move around very well, maybe the guy having sex was lonely and frightened and needed physical contact... who knows? You can't judge people on an outward, shallow look-over of their lives.If you want to help people out with their struggles for virtue why not invite the gluttony guy out to walk with you, or ask the lustful guy what intimate relationships mean to him, or why he's lonely or out of control? Maybe they're looking for help, virtue is it's own reward and all that - and lack of it is it's own justice in many ways. I think the psycho killer could've stayed at home and worked on himself, it would've worked out on it's own.

0307473708|1.0|As a thrill for fantasy this kind of thing is ok, but I see too many real losses in life to enjoy this kind of thing. Serial killers aren't very bright, they lose all the time, life, trust, love goodness, moral and emotional intelligence - which is really the highest form of intelligence. I get tired of the glorification of serial killers as these smart guys or whatever.... they think they're little cunningly cruel vignettes are something when in fact they're just losing. I've met this kind of person and not only are they not smart, they're cruel and weak. I'm tired of this being sold to people because I think we live in a world that celebrates this stuff to excuse it's own cruelty instead of confronting it and growing stronger. We're losing our heart muscle and replacing it with rotten death. Death is the ultimate loss of excitement, passion, heart, love, goodness of all kinds. You are what you eat and all that. I get the thrill factor as a fake thrill though - like a roller coaster, it's just that people don't know the difference between fantasy and reality and to lose even one beautiful good life for some loser's weak, struggling ego,.... ugh. Predators are more cunning that intelligent. The real smart guys will be the guys that cure death, war, disease, pain, create deep passion and fulfill what's dear to people with intense love and intelligence. If you could sustain perfect love for eternity - then you'd have a complete intelligence - moral, emotional, mechanical, social in all ways. Most people fall very short of that however, which is why this guy exists, when you can't succeed, pretend your lowest, most ugliest self is the real glory.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This book shares a very personal story with struggle and circumstances that, despite the odds, are overcome through perseverance and an exceptional hunger for learning.  It is a wonderful example of how people can excel beyond what others expect and despite others' lack of faith.  But, this boy has also been partly a product of the good nature of those who saw his potential.  It is a story that can inspire us to be truly thankful for the seemingly simple things that we enjoy daily (like running water, electricity, and food).  It is also a story that should inspire us to reach out to others in need, for that's all it takes sometimes.

0634049011|5.0|So I have been playing guitar for approximately a year and a half now. Originally I was looking for music books to help supplement my weekly half hour guitar lesson. During this period I have purchased a lot of books and dvds. By far this has been the greatest investment! When I first started playing the guitar the fretboard looked so daunting; so many notes! I spent a lot of time memorizing all the triad shapes and even the \\"CAGED\\" sequence.<br /><br />Over the past month I have put my best effort to follow the instructions of how to use this book and in a month my knowledge and my ability to play guitar has increased substantially! I have been really impressed. Honestly, it does take effort to stick with this book especially when you continually have the practice the scales. If you really want to become a better guitar player then practicing all the examples is required and it will definitely pay off, as it has for me.<br /><br />This is the first review that I have ever written about anything I have ever purchased. I am very happy with this purchase.
0143118420|5.0|I am about finished reading this book and it has been just delightful.  The gifted author has unique insight to share with readers.  The book has been out for awhile, and I felt I needed to wait, somehow, to read it when the times marched on from all the commercial hoopla with the movie (haven't seen that).  Because the author reeled me in with her great and relevant story, I ordered and await her next book as well.    One more thing- in pretty much glancing over a lot of the other reviews- wow- lots of jealousy out there, eh?!  Maybe go read Angela's Ashes?
0736092269|4.0|This book has a lot of great info.  Whether you're a beginner or serious fitness fanatic you can find helpful tips.  Most if not all the body parts and muscles are covered including stretching and ways of avoiding injury.  The illustrations and labels are easy to read and makes it very user friendly.  The only thing I would change if I could is that I would make this spiralbound so it stays open to a specific page if you choose.  Worth every penny regardless!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Lovable group of nerds try to attempt to mainstream and deal with everyday problems to the best of their abilities. Very cute and funny show.  I have all the seasons and we watch them periodically.  My favorite episodes are the two that include Sheldon (MoonPie) vs Will Wheaton.  I found the third season just as humorous as the first and second.

0316066524|2.0|Like many other folks, David Foster Wallace's suicide put his work back on my radar. Before taking on the \\"Infinite Jest Challenge\\" I worked out some, building the arm and wrist strength that would clearly be required to handle this gorilla of a book.<br /><br />What a waste of time. I tried. I really, really tried. I forced myself to labor on, giving Wallace every benefit of the doubt as I waded through detailed minutiae that wallowed in his apparent high impression of his own talent. The tennis trivia. The drug trivia. The prep school trivia. The pointless tangents. It kept getting worse and I finally stalled completely in page after endless page of vapid crap about Boston's AA community.<br /><br />In some measure this volume reminds me of the overratedness of Thomas Wolfe's [[ASIN:0743297318 Look Homeward, Angel]], a writer equally taken with himself and obsessed with detail. Wolfe, at least, had an editor willing to lop off half the original manuscript. Wallace had no such luck.<br /><br />The only joke is on anyone stupid enough to buy this book. Run away! Run away!
B002ZG9774|5.0|Regardless of what some critics have to say, I saw the movie to make my own opinion & I LOVED IT!! its a good mix of COYOTE UGLY, SHOWGIRLS & even CHICAGO, its Sexy, has a great looking star cast, good coreography, not bad songs, ever so lovable Cher & talented Christina.   yes its not the most original story, but how many recent movies have really original stories ?! ..every movie is partly inspired by some old hit or even some foregin film.  So just pack up your troubles, go get energised & enjoy this feel good movie.  lets hope the Blu Ray has a lot of extra features & even the Original movie sountrack cd.
B002JIOQCO|4.0|Wolfmother is a band behind its time, which isn't really a bad thing. The Australian rockers seem to be stuck in a time warp, where the year is always 1971. They celebrate and mimic the sounds of classic rock legends like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath with huge riffs and the ever-present wail of frontman/guitarist/songwriter Andrew Stockdale.  The band's second full-length album Cosmic Egg is a celebration of all things rock, and while they're not incredibly original, they're able to rock you just the same. And with a dearth of good rock bands these days, I'll take a band that wishes it was opening for Jimi Hendrix.  The latest effort comes three years after the release of the band's self-titled debut, and much has happened since then. Namely, Stockdale replaced the other members of the band with a completely new group, Axl Rose-style. You can't really tell the difference because Stockdale is the star of the show, the band's frontman and musical leader.  The band is tight, but the main difference between this record and the previous is a more consistent set of songs from Stockdale.  While the debut contained a couple memorable tracks like \\"Woman\\" and \\"Dimension,\\" it's not a record I've revisted all too often.  From the opening bass-line of \\"California Queen\\" (which is somewhat reminiscent of Red Hot Chili Peppers' Around the World), the album has very few lulls and is filled with memorable moments. \\"Queen\\" and lead single \\"New Moon Rising\\" both have the Zep meets Sabbath vibe to it, as Stockdale's voice often sounds like a cross between Robert Plant and Ozzy Osbourne, with a dash of Jack White and John Lennon sprinkled in for good measure.  \\"White Feather\\" has an especially White Stripesish vibe, with Stockdale's vocal phrasing often coming very close to White's. \\"Sun Dial\\" is the only track I'd call an overt lift, as the riff sounds like Black Sabbath's \\"NIB\\" as played by Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello and the chorus sounds much like \\"NIB\\" as well. It's still a rocking track, but incredibly derivative.  Wolfmother try to stretch out on the Beatlesque ballad \\"In the Morning,\\" and Stockdale sounds like the leader of a prog rock band in the other ballad \\"Far Away.\\" Think of Yes on steroids and you have a decent estimation of that track, which is the better of the two ballads.  The title track and \\"Pilgrim\\" are a few more strong rockers, with the second track sounding like a cross between Zeppelin and Oasis.  The most original and perhaps best song is the album's final track, \\"Violence of the Sun.\\" It clocks in around six minutes, giving the album an epic closer. It's a slow building song, with a haunting keyboard riff kicking it off, with guitars slowly building in the mix. Stockdale gives his vocals a nice workout on this one, building into a shriek as the instruments blend together for an impressive crescendo. It's here where you get a glimpse of a band that may one day rise above the level of deft imitator and become an actual innovator, but for now we'll have to accept Wolfmother for what it is: a kick-ass karaoke classic rock band.
0553381687|5.0|Ok, this review is written mainly for you folks out there who are wary of the \\"fantasy\\" genre and all the scary adjectives that go along with it. So, let me be upfront about my background--I'm a Neil Gaiman fan (and much of his work is dark fantasy, in a way), I'm a Terry Pratchett fan (and most of his work mocks, in a subtle way, the entire fantasy genre...despite being a part of it), and outside of that, I haven't played much in the fantasy sandbox.<br /><br />I was hesitant to read this book for two reasons. I shall deal with the first reason here. All of the notions I had of \\"swords and sorcery\\" fantasy counseled against starting this book (no offense intended to fans of that genre, I am merely stating that I didn't think it was \\"my cup of tea\\"). Despite that, I made the plunge and am so glad that I did.<br /><br />Martin has created a world rich with history and mostly believable. This story is brilliantly written. There is plenty of suspense, character development, and most readers will develop emotional attachments to some of the characters. There are plenty of swords and not a whole lot of \\"sorcery\\", making this accessible to most who would otherwise shun the fantasy genre. (Fair warning--the sorcery bit ramps up in later volumes, but never, at least in my opinion, to unpalatable levels).<br /><br />I think this series would appeal strongly to fans of fantasy, fans of historical novelisations (particularly European history), and generally anyone who enjoys well-written fiction (perhaps setting aside those that demand 100% realism).<br /><br />My second reservation is still in place and took a leap of faith to overcome. I was hesitant to start this series having serious doubts as to whether it would ever be finished. On that score, only time will tell.
1932100385|5.0|First, very simply, this book in a highly readable manner will give you the POWER to make INFORMED CHOICES about you and your family's daily food intakes, and this power of choice is EXTRAORDINARY. The China Study is the documented study which took years and years to survey the diets and rates of death in 2,400 counties in China. It further explored the conditions, and implications for nutrition and health. One could argue if you read this study, you do not need to go any further in your quest for optimal nutrition.<br /><br />Now having said that, there are a handful of people in the United States involved in medicine and nutrition that are recognized by their peers to be academic all-stars. These are people that you can take to the bank with you. They are solid, reliable, and have decades of experience. Their work has been peer-reviewed by other masters in their discipline.<br /><br />Colin Campbell is such a man. He is a distinguished professor of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University for more years than most of us have been alive. He is also the principal player behind what is called the China Study.<br /><br />He sums up the condition of our current state of health in America by telling us many things:<br /><br />1) We all recognize that this country spends more per individual on health care than any other society has even ever dreamed, and yet other societies are healthier<br /><br />2) Close to 65% of Americans are overweight<br /><br />3) We are as prone to heart disease as we were 30 years ago in spite of medical advances<br /><br />4) More than 50% of all Americans have a health problem that requires a prescription every week<br /><br />5) There are 315 million Americans. Over 100 million of us have high cholesterol<br /><br />6) About one-third of our children are either overweight or very much in danger of becoming such<br /><br />The book has 368 pages of narrative supplemented by footnotes taking you to page 404 and then the index. It is highly readable. As far as I am concerned, these are the most important and timeless conclusions:<br /><br />* Nutrition is the result of actions of everything you take into your body COMBINED, and more importantly it is synergistic. This means that the combination of everything is greater than the sum of the foods themselves.<br /><br />* Some people believe that vitamin supplements are a panacea for optimal health. This is WRONG.<br /><br />* Regardless of what animal based foods you eat, all nutrients are better provided by plants.<br /><br />* Genes by themselves are not the determinants of disease as most people believe. Genes must be activated or expressed to play a role. An analogy would be that genes are the bullets in a gun, but you still have to pull the trigger.<br /><br />* Noxious chemicals can be substantially controlled through nutrition.<br /><br />* We know that nutrition can prevent disease in its early stages, but what is also true is that nutrition can be helpful in reversing and halting the very same diseases in later stages.<br /><br />* If you have a chronic disease, and nutrition is helping you with this disease, it is also true that this same nutrition will be beneficial to your general health.<br /><br />* All areas of our existence are benefited by good nutrition.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Read this book and it will CHANGE your understanding of nutrition, and your life, and thank you for reading this review.<br /><br />Richard C.

0553573411|4.0|Seemed to me that everything went downhill for the Six Duchies in this book, which is clearly a staging for what must be a remarkable (and perhaps not very believable) turn of events in the last book of the trilogy, Assassin's Quest.  Despite having finished Royal Assassin several months ago, I haven't read the third book yet and don't plan to.  The reviews generally describe it as an excessively drawn out buildup to a disappointingly abrupt and deus ex machina type ending, so I decided not to waste my time.    This book moves along fairly well compared to the typically slow middle entry of a trilogy.  Unfortunately for Fitz and the rest of the good guys, this brisk plot movement really just translates to a rapid deterioration of affairs.  I won't spoil anything but will note that about halfway through the book, Prince Verity departs on a journey of desperation to try to save the kingdom.  Of course this leaves the untrustworthy Prince Regal in effective power, after which as you can imagine things just go from bad to worse.    The love story of Fitz & Molly, as written, doesn't fit into the overall plot and simply detracts from the quality of this book.  Better to have just left the whole thing out and kept Molly a friend living in town with her drunkard father.  You can read reviews of the third book to get a hint of what ends up happening between Fitz and Molly.  If that's what ultimately happens, why even bother with the silly side plot at all?    The quality of the writing is on par with the first book (that is to say, fairly good) and the characters are painted pretty well.  The overall mood is significantly darker than in the first book; by the end the kingdom is in big big trouble and there is no evident rescue plan.  I enjoyed reading this one and hope to return to Hobb one day in the future when she's able to finish a series as well as she started it!  The ending is, after all, a big part of what makes the time spent in 1500+ pages worth it.
1573921394|5.0|The goal of the GT was to revolutionize the discipline of economics itself. Keynes' presentation was formal - however the real conflict was not with definitions of economic categories, nor with any economic-theoretic concepts as such, but instead with the entire shape which the 'science' of economics had espoused and its real world limitations. What else does 'revolution' mean but a complete upheaval of what was formerly the word of truth and order. It is the goal of this review to put lay the grounds of the theoretical conflict Keynes waged on conventional thought and unveil the essence of Keynes' disagreement.<br />  I<br /><br /> The opening chapter of 'The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money' is titled 'The Postulates of the Classical Economics'. This is because Keynes himself believed that his challenge was to the theoretical core of what was then the entirety of developed economic theory - apparently the economic-theoretic tradition ranging from Ricardo through Marshall. He called this the 'classical tradition' and identified its inception with the classical political economists as such. In reality Keynes' criticisms had nothing to do with what was classical political economy, but instead with micro-oriented marginalist tradition which had emerged and transformed this study into 'Economics'. Hence they had nothing to do with Ricardo, whom he believed to be his main adversary. The mainstream, epitomized in Keynes' mentor at Cambridge, Alfred Marshall, had long since lost any connection with 'classical' theory as represented by classical political economy - what was being challenged in 'The General Theory' was not classical economy at all, but instead the embryonic form of the now dominant neoclassical economics. Classical economy did not argue, for example, that real wages or prices were fundamentally determined by marginal utilities and disutilities in exchange; thus it was not argued that market prices tended toward a unique full employment equilibrium - central, as we shall see, to Keynes' criticism of the limitations of 'classical theory'. This became theoretically fundamental only after Ricardo's death, with the abandonment of the labor embodied theory of value by the mainstream of economics.<br /><br /> The topic of the disconnect Keynes had between the body of economic theory he believed he was critiquing and that body of thought he actually was critiquing is important not for the pleasure of questioning Keynes' erudition. This topic is important because it is actually the key to understanding Keynes' developments in 'The General Theory' itself . Keynes had ultimately linked what are fundamental assumptions and methods which form the bedrock of neoclassical theory with classical political economy, and most especially Ricardo as the height of classical theory, simply because they had an existence within classical theory. Saying something exists is saying nothing of how or why it exists, however, and in the case of classical theory these concepts existed only as assumptions which had direct relation to the particular method the classicists employed. These assumptions were not fundamental to the operation of their entire framework. For classical political economy, market prices were simply spot relations with no fundamental importance in regards to the essential features of the continued reproduction of capitalist production. If there was a drought, corn prices would increase; if there was a good harvest, corn prices would decrease. There was nothing fundamental to be found in markets themselves which explained the uniqueness of capitalism as a mode of production or its tendential movements.  As any non-essential feature or friction is abstracted from in order to analyze a system in its purity, in classical political economy it was market relations - supply and demand - which were abstracted from to gain an understanding of the production relations which underpinned capitalist production.<br /><br /> This is the root of Keynes' misunderstanding. To say that 'market relations' are abstracted from amounts to the same thing as postulating that markets are in equilibrium. A unique equilibrium, in the sense of full employment of resources, was postulated by classical theory not to explain everything but in order to abstract from what could not explain anything. Even Marx, the critic of classical political economy, makes this abstraction in postulating equal organic compositions of capital in Capital Vol. I. Marx clearly did not believe that there ever existed even proximate to this harmonious equilibrium of supply and demand. Keynes' lack of an understanding of classical theory essentially caused him to equate what was irrelevant for classical theory with what is essential to neoclassical theory. These concepts did have their birth during the last and most developed period of classical political economy; and this period should be identified with Ricardo and the theoretical construct he established - however from these two essentially correct identifications it does not follow that classical economy 'stands or falls' with the validity of either of these concepts. It is neoclassical economics which does.<br /><br /> This is no simple coincidence. We have noted that neoclassical economics was in an embryonic form of development at this point in time. It was even fashionable within the discipline of economics at this time, per the influential work of Samuel Hollander, to view the development of economic theory as progressing along the same lines from the time of Smith to its time; being unable to fully grasp the true laws of the market as they were in such early stages of developing them . Thus we have such confused notions straight from Marshall himself that classical theory focused 'almost elusively on the supply side', and Jevons along with the marginalists focused 'almost exclusively on the demand side', whereas it was the relationship between the two that gave us the entire picture. It was only later, with the work of Piero Sraffa, that this view of a linear progression of thought underwent drastic changes.<br /><br /> Today, the question of what precisely the classical theorists were developing is largely moot within the discipline of economics - we have before us the truth, why bother arguing trivialities of who said what? If, as this work shall argue, this 'truth' is found to be lacking, it is my suggestion that economists begin to familiarize themselves with their own history. It is only within these 'trivialities' which a proper understanding of the development of economic theory, hence its current shape and its limitations, is to be found. I suggest that Adam Smith and David Ricardo be read and understood, as they are also central to understanding Keynes.<br />  II<br /><br /> It is the postulates of neoclassical theory which Keynes directly addresses in the 'General Theory'. There is a point at which classical and neoclassical theory have a common base, however this is outside of the realm of economic categories. As such, there is no place for a discussion of the relationship between Keynes and classical theory in an elucidation of what is written within the 'General Theory'. The General Theory is ultimately Keynes' conflict with the postulates of neoclassical theory, which he defines as given in their terms by three interconnected propositions:<br /><br />1) The real wage is equal to the marginal disutility of existing employment;<br />2) There is no such thing as involuntary unemployment;<br />3) Supply creates its own demand.<br /><br />These three propositions are interconnected in the sense that if one is to hold then the other two must necessarily be assumed. For example, if we claim that supply creates its own demand we must already take as given that there is no such thing as involuntary unemployment and that the real wage is equal to the marginal disutility of labor. This is because the assumption that supply creates its own demand is conditional: production in this scenario must be carried out for use, and therefore nothing is produced wherein the goods produced are not destined for final consumption. As the employment of resources is required for the production of goods, and the production of goods is the production of definite use values, then the employment of resources moves parallel to the movement of use value. This means that the production of goods continues to increase, hence the employment of resources continues to increase, until there is no use for them in terms of their specific cost and hence no demand. Any unemployment of labor that exists thus must be voluntary because the 'return' to the factor employed, in this case labor, is not being accepted by that factor - that factor could employ itself at a lower price,hence a lower cost would be attached to the good in question and it would once again find a use and an impetus for being produced. Therefore, what is 'really' not being accepted is in fact the social valuation of the employment of a resource - labor in this case - in producing a specific good. The burden of unemployment in this case falls directly on the unemployed and their unwillingness to work for the price at which society values their effort. Seeing, however, as everyone must produce to consume, it is not an option to withdrawal ones labor without withdrawing ones means of consumption. The market thus regulates societies willingness to employ resources with the actual employment of those resources, and from this it follows that the real wage must be absolutely equal to the marginal disutility of existing employment for supply to create its own demand. We abstract, of course, from 'frictions', i.e., the working of the market mechanism after some external change in environment, or 'interventions' into the mechanism itself, i.e., state regulations, subsidization, or monopoly/monopsony power. These three postulates are more commonly known as one term which defines any and all of them, 'Say's Law'.<br /><br />  Say's Law is for Keynes a fiction from which it is difficult to escape. On the one hand it is convenient in that it simplifies what is the problem of the determination of economic categories into a single problem of defining individual choice. The economic-theoretic problem becomes an analytical task performed by taking a specific set of social and institutional factors as given as opposed to an investigation of actual society and its institutions by stripping individuals of their social bond and, in turn, simply assuming a 'base' set of characteristics of these individuals when they partake in exchange relations. It should be noted that already there is a contradiction between the need to abstract from  social relations in order to define this individual and on the other hand assume a specific set of social relations in order for individuals to interact. On the other hand,  the postulation of Say's Law in appearance seems to be a way to answer problems related to the interaction of individuals in society. Unfortunately, these answers rest upon the fact that in postulating Say's Law we are actually abstracting from social relations in general and thus harmonizing them. In this harmony there exist no social relations binding individuals choices in any way nor does there exist any dynamic tendencies within the way human beings structure their mode of production which determine the production and distribution of social product between individuals. Each is an independent producer and consumer which enters daily into production and exchange to subsist. Exchange becomes a process of normalization of aggregated choices; if a butcher wishes to consume two pounds of meat and a barrel of ale, and if a pound of meat exchanges for half a barrel of ale, then this butcher will produce daily four pounds of meet - two for his own consumption and two to exchange for his ale. Through exchange preferences are revealed, andthrough exchange the production of goods to meet these preferences becomes normalized. Every individual receives a part of the social product equivalent to the amount of sacrifice which that individual contributed to its materialization. If this construction actually did describe reality, I find it hard to imagine a reason that anyone with the problems of social organization in mind would be opposed to structuring society in a way to yield such results.<br /><br />  III<br /><br /> The real world does not conform to this harmonic vision. Economic theory has for quite some time been uninterested in conceiving of this problem as one which has its roots in their own methods and assumptions. The question which has been posed by economists is not why has this theory failed to describe reality, but why has reality not behaved as this theory claims it should; what practical factors infringe on the realization of this analytic harmony? The question which Keynes posed was very different. In the midst of the Great Depression, wherein the rift between theory and reality was no longer an academic curiosity, Keynes was concerned with addressing why this analytic construct failed to adequately capture, and thus adequately explain, reality through its own limitations - not why reality failed to 'behave' properly according to a theory. The conclusions drawn by Keynes are that the neoclassical framework simply does not describe reality because it instead focuses its efforts on describing a fictional world which it is believed reality should conform to. The problem with attempting to transplant the requirements of this world onto the real world, that is the problem of its application to reality, stems from the essential features of reality it ignores: time does not matter, accumulation does not occur, and money does not exist. The neoclassical framework describes a barter economy wherein all wants are satisfied by current production and temporal decision making is nonexistent. It does not describe an actually existing monetary economy; it does not address issues which can only be given meaning in an analysis of a  capitalist economy. The question posed by Keynes is ultimately one of whether an analysis of a barter economy captures the essential features of what is in reality a monetary economy, and, if not, in what ways does a monetary economy function differently.<br /><br />  By distinguishing between a monetary and barter economy, Keynes central criticism revolves around the problems which accumulation and time have for neoclassical theory. Present production need not only serve immediate consumption but instead may be withdrawn from circulation completely in its money form. Not only may it be withdrawn, but it must be withdrawn if production is to be carried out on an expanded scale,. There is thus no longer a harmonic state of simple reproduction where all needs are satisfied indefinitely; wherein a butcher or brewer who, having no use for their surplus good but to exchange it for another, produce and exchange goods which they themselves shall not consume for other immediate consumption needs. Instead, production is now carried out with the necessary goal of maintaining and expanding a given surplus. The decision to accumulate a surplus, however, is a decision made through time; and decisions made through time are decisions made with a consideration to the past and speculation of the future. Ultimately, Say's Law amounts to the notion that all production which does not serve immediate consumption must be production for given consumption in the future. Production must therefore not only be carried out for what is presently useful, but for what is 'known' to be useful in the future. Keynes believed this to be the central premise of 'classical theory', what he called its \\"...axiom of parallels...(from which) all the rest follows - the social advantage of private and national thrift, the traditional attitude towards the rate of interest the classical theory theory of employment, the quantity theory of money, the unqualified advantages of laissez-faire...\\".<br /><br /> This 'axiom of parallels' is essentially a modified form of the 'classical postulates'; modified that is, for an economy which accumulates and thus has a complex web of interrelations through time. These interrelations and the macroeconomic effects which they have were largely ignored by the mainstream of economic theory through their acceptance of what Keynes thought was standard Ricardian doctrine 8. Ultimately, in Ricardo's framework money entered as a factor that could not influence the relative prices of commodities. This is because Ricardo's framework was concerned with analyzing the \\"laws which govern the distribution of wealth between the classes which concur in its formation\\" - that is, it was a theory of value and distribution. Nevertheless, Keynes identified Ricardo as the creator of the doctrine of money neutrality which came to be known 'The Quantity Theory of Money'. It was this doctrine which Keynes believed tied together the entire fiction of Says Law and made it seem as if it were applicable to an analysis of a monetary economy. This is because in order to claim generality, money must enter the barter economy apparatus as a convenient 'middle man' in the exchange of commodities which has no affect whatsoever on levels of production and employment of resources. The relative value of commodities must be determined by the relative utilities and disutilities of producing and consuming them, and money must only nominally affect them in terms of their absolute price levels - not their exchange ratios. Thus, in order to disconnect the Quantity Theory from Says Law, it must be shown that the introduction of money is not simply a convenience which does away with 'coincidence of wants', but instead something which has appreciable affects on output and employment as a whole.<br /><br /> It is precisely this which Keynes does by linking the functions of money to the distinctions which arose in the change from analyzing a barter economy to analyzing a monetary economy. Money is not simply a means of exchange but also a means of payment and a store of value. As a means of payment the role money plays in time takes precedence over its other functions, and the need to establish cash flows from assets and to validate debts on assets becomes central to the continued existence of both capitals and households. As a store of value, the role of money in the process of accumulation, speculation, and security in conditions of uncertainty takes precedence and with it the need to withdrawal money from the realm of circulation into either industrial surpluses or the hoarding functions of liquidity preference. The entire notion of supply being equal to demand is meaningless in this context, as it is clear that money is withdrawn from circulation both in terms of the continued need to establish cash flows or validate debts when money serves as a means of payment and for the simple yet capitalistically essential need to accumulate present wealth and speculate on future wealth when money serves as a store of value. The expansion and contraction of the money supply thus becomes an internal phenomena, and as such its causes and effects are no longer able to be abstracted from. Say's Law is applicable only to an economy which does not reproduce itself on an expanded scale - a static, or steady state. In this state, the entire problem of social demand is done away with a priori by the equivocation of the fact that aggregate returns to all factors equals the aggregate value of commodities produced by those factors with the assumption that the aggregate costs of this output are met by social demand - that is, by aggregate consumption 10 This requires that the entire product of a factor, or the whole of the returns to factors, enters circulation for consumption. To make this the center of an analysis is to make not a capitalist economy which expands and contracts production internally but a static economy in which all consumption, and thus production, is met ad infinitum at current quantitative and qualitative schedules of output a general 'model' of an economy.<br />  IV<br /><br /> Having established that the postulates of 'classical theory' are not general in the context of a monetary economy, Keynes proceeded to abolish once and for all the principle of neoclassical economic theory which gave the entire framework consistency. As we have noted, The Quantity Theory of Money essentially makes the claim that money is 'neutral' in the sense that its introduction into exchange relations has no affect on the determination of relative prices or the levels of output and employment as a whole. The neutrality of money, however, is the assumption of an external money supply which only changes when the good which serves as money becomes more or less scarce. When money becomes specie, or fiat, this assumption is the assumption of an external money supply which only changes by the state apparatus expanding or contracting the money supply. External in this context means that money is created not within or due to the functioning of the system, but by an external force - be it nature for the classicists or the state for the neoclassicists. As its change in this sense represents a realignment of 'supply', its effects on all economic variables is strictly nominal - markets adjust absolute prices, the denomination of prices in terms of the money commodity, to the new price level while the relative value of commodities, or the exchange ratios of commodities, remains the same. The price level is determined by the product of the money supply and the velocity of money.<br /><br /> It has been shown that the distinction between a barter and a monetary economy bring forth the issues of accumulation and time which have their parallel in new roles of money as a store of value and means of payment. Keynes' challenge to the Quantity Theory of Money is simply that money is not a mystical entity which is created externally and having no affect on relative prices, but instead is bound in the macroeconomic web with every other man made device. Money is created internally due to the requirements of the continued existence of capitalist production itself. This is because to produce on an expanded scale there must first exist a means in which to finance this expansion. Furthermore, if we introduce the liquidity preference - that is the need to hold money due to conditions of uncertainty or the desire to hold money as a means to speculate (interest) - a dilemma arises in that industrial financing requires an amount of money which is simply not there to reproduce itself. It is mathematically impossible for the amount of money derived from a given stock of capital in circulation to replenish a given stock of capital, i.e., to reproduce it, if any amount of this money is taken out of the fund which replenishes this stock. Not only will the amount of money required to reproduce the value of existing stock be insufficient, but the amount of money required to reproduce it on an expanded scale will by definition not exist. The problem this poses for the neoclassical framework is that its fundamental determinant - individual choice under heroic assumptions and given conditions - loses all significance in the determination of the real economic variables in question. The problem is one of a limiting force on the available means of financing expanded reproduction. After spending so much time reproaching the unrealistic assumption of production for use in a monetary economy, Keynes makes the topic itself irrelevant in light of the fact that a gap between consumption expenditure and the aggregate of production must be filled by some other source for capital to reproduce itself. How, then, is capitalism to function if there is no way to continue the accumulation of capital?<br /><br /> The answer, that is the 'means' to finance expanded reproduction, is the internal creation of money through the creation of debt. Money is created internally because capitalist production requires it. Any specific set of use values which this production was meant to meet under the 'classical postulates' becomes lost in a future of uncertainty; accumulation becoming a means to an end. The fact that production takes place through uncertain time creates a liquidity preference - money as a store of value; the fact that the economy is an economy that accumulates in time necessitates financing of production on higher levels than circulating capital allows - money as a means of payment. Both of these functions of money lead to the internal creation of money; the internal creation of money is inconsistent with the neutrality of money posited by the Quantity Theory, and the affects which the liquidity preference and expanded accumulation have on determining the level of employed resources invalidates the conclusion of the Quantity Theory in that the ratio of exchange is necessarily affected through determining the mass of commodities which are produced. Thus, if by nominal it is meant that money is not real, that is it may be created out of thin air with no connection to the actual utility of a commodity, Keynes agrees. Not only does Keynes agree, but for Keynes this is precisely the reason why a monetary economy does not operate on the basis of Says Law. It is once again the attempt  of neoclassical theory to squeeze from one truth another which assumes too much - simply because money exists alongside commodities with no seeming connection to their actual use values does not mean that money acting as exchange value cannot affect the way in which these commodities are produced. To assume this is to assume Say's Law; to assume Say's Law is to assume away money. We have, I hope, left far behind the time in which 'scientific truths' are verified by assuming their initial conditions.<br /><br />  V<br /><br /> The critique of the neoclassical postulates defined in terms of Say's Law unveiled that what has been accepted as the general determinant of economic variables and the movement of the economy as a whole is untenable. What this critique revealed was that once the economy is analyzed in terms of a monetary economy it becomes necessary to incorporate aspects of production and consumption through time and the accumulation of capital. The incorporation of these phenomena pose a problem for existing theory because it has no method of resolving them short of assuming that they do not exist. This is because within the neoclassical framework all production serves immediate consumption - money in this scenario need only function as a medium of exchange. As such, the economy is analyzed as a barter economy wherein the level of present consumption is at a point were all schedules of use value, utility, are exhausted. It is implicit within this framework that production is carried out for use. As the role of money is limited to this single function, the only aspects of the economy which are seen are those which pertain to this specific function of money. Once it is admitted that money also serves the role of a means of payment and a store of value, the need for a new paradigm which is capable of explaining how the process of expansion and contraction in a capitalist economy is created internally is necessary.<br /><br /> Keynes' methodological departure - in actuality a return to the method employed by Ricardo and the classicists - represents a strong shift in this direction. His claim is not that the continuing expansion of the money supply allows for the financing of individual capitals, but that it allows for the aggregate of available circulating money to meet the needs of capital as a whole to expand itself. Individual capitals may or may not have trouble financing their own expansion with a given mass of finance because an individual capital canaffect the relative distribution of this mass between capitals. As soon as we realize, however, that the problem is not one of the distribution of surpluses between individual capitals, the determination of which supply and demand on the market play a pivotal role, but the mass of available value to be distributed itself, we are at the point where we can see that the resolution of this issue cannot possibly occur within the market mechanism. This is because when the mass of available money to finance past accumulation fails to reproduce it, or fails to validate it, capitals must liquidate. As capitals liquidate, or simply go out of business, this necessarily involves the unemployment of labor. But it is precisely this labor the return to which forms the substance of consumption, and it is precisely this liquidated capital on which they were formerly employed. How is it then that there can exist a labor market in which marginal utilities and disutilities meet to determine a unique level of employment if in the first place the total mass of labor that can be employed at any time is bounded by the amount of investment in fixed capital?<br /><br /> The answer is that the interaction of marginal utilities and disutilities do not determine a unique level of employment consistent with, or tending toward, a full employment of resources, but instead they determine a level of employment consistent with a current level of investment. Competition in the labor market is competition not for the determination of the level of employment but for the relative distribution of the mass of existing value. In this way, Keynes maintains marginalist theory but reduces its role to one of a determination of the relative distribution of existing value.lled its \\"...axiom of parallels...(from which) all the rest follows - the social advantage of private and national thrift, the traditional attitude towards the rate of interest the classical theory theory of employment, the quantity theory of money, the unqualified advantages of laissez-faire...\\".     This 'axiom of parallels' is essentially a modified form of the 'classical postulates'; modified that is, for an economy which accumulates and thus has a complex web of interrelations through time.

0061537969|5.0|As usual, before purchasing a book, I read some positive and some negative reviews.  I was a little sketchy about purchasing this book because of the negative reviews.  I am SO glad that I ended up taking the risk.  The Art of Racing in the Rain had me tearing up within the first chapter.  If you're an animal lover, like me, you will love this book.  It had me laughing and crying.  I ended up not sleeping the night that I started reading this book because I just couldn't put it down. I HAD to keep reading.  One of my favorites, highly recommended!
B0031OCY2E|4.0|I think Damon did a pretty great job.  He created an interesting portrait of a fellow who wasn't quite reading all the cards right (or was he?) and the film is a journey of interpreting and then reinterpreting your interpretation of this character Marc Whitaker.  If nothing else I found the film entertaining.  Loved the light and airy soundtrack as well, adding levity to an otherwise over-wrought situation.  I felt this movie moved mostly at a fairly quick and engaging pace though it became somewhat distressing to see how far gone our protagonist really was by the end.   It's a white-collar drama and Damon plays a pretty good dweeb.  It's almost black humor at times.  It may have become longish towards the end, and it never rectified the protagonist which may be what some found disappointing, but overall the movie is still entertaining enough and worth a watch.  I like that Matt Damon can do roles like this.

From the touchy and quite somber \\"Goodbye, Apathy\\" to \\"Someone to Save You,\\" you get One Republic's initial audience spotlight thingy. I don't know.<br /><br />I was blown away by \\"Say (All I Need),\\" which you may have heard because it was a hit. It's like a dreamy tough track with a hot beat and groovy electric guitar that switches up the flow in the chorus and makes you want to sing it. Thank goodness the lyrics are included in the booklet. \\"Mercy\\" grew on me; it's kinda mellow and hard at the same time. \\"Stop and Stare\\"...need not say more. \\"Apologize\\" is what got this band their fame. The melodies among the hidden gems fluctuate between mellow and energetic. \\"Won't Stop,\\" a fantasy love song, has to be one of my favorites; it's completely mellow. \\"Come Home\\" was the only song without a beat, and was the lowest point of this album.<br /><br />One Republic's lead vocalist brings the attention with his wonderful vocals that mingle with \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" drum and guitar harmonies.
1594202842|5.0|The parents who care a lot about their children are not afraid of being perceived as strict or overbearing. Education is a journey and endeavor and it is not about result. The result is used to feedback to the effort and to create a virtuous cycle. The central theme of this book is very similar to that of the \\"Talent Code\\" and \\"Talent is overrated\\". The likelihood of that the parent is right is probably much higher than that letting the kids to use their discretion.

1416550550|3.0|All in all I do think this was a good story and the writing was decent.  I do think pages of descriptions could have been left out.    I stuck with this book because it reminded me of long books I loved as a young reader in my twenties.   Books like Penmarick and Casselmara come to mind.  I had to stop in the middle of reading this book and read a Margaret Atwood for my book club.  That downer of a book helped take the magic out of this read and when I got back to it the mood had gone away for me.  Perhaps it is age but I kept saying \\"get on with it already!\\"  I just do not have the patience for excessive wordage.  This book and it's mystery could have been wrapped up at least in 400 pages or less.  Nell's story from being on the boat to being rescued and raised in a loving family was an amazing one.  I think it needed retelling in the 1975 and 2005 parts of the book.  I think it added to the wonderment of the story and this life.  At the end it was up to me,the reader to remind myself of this major part of the story.  A few years will go by maybe and I will read her third book,The Distant Hours I am sure.

B0001ARCFA|2.0|If you are looking for a set of headphones that will equal a good set of speakers--these are not those.<br /><br />I had been anxious to try these from positive reviews around the Internet.  Right out of the box, I was sorely disappointed.  They do not sound either bright or rich.  Granted, the sound from deep bass through the upper voice range is quite acceptable, but anything higher often breaks into a crackle and sounds very artificially generated--a lot like the cheapest small speakers you might ever have dealt with.  Real detail?  Forget it!<br /><br />My work is in radio and involves a fair amount of editing and mixing, in addition to on-air announcing.  Because I have never found an acceptable pair of cans for the editing, I much prefer speakers.  But due to the work environment, I often have to don earphones to keep from annoying others.  My actual preference is a set of Philips earbuds I bought while in Europe (not available in the US), the SHE2650.  They're cheap (under the equivalent of US$10 when on sale), have amazing bass response, and excellent clarity and detail when equalized with a linear slope of boost starting around 880khz and ending at +10db at 20khz (add bass boost to taste).<br /><br />Over the years, my observation has been that anybody can fairly quickly adjust to different speakers, headphones, and even varying equalizations, and think they are happy and getting good sound.  Reviewers that say they needed some time to get used to these phones, demonstrate my point.  But in A/B comparisons, these K240S cans do not measure up.  They sound like a sore throat feels--scratchy, not smooth and clear.  Definitely not worth the money to me.  They will be relegated to editing voice only--or more likely, they will never come out of the drawer.  It is a real two-star disappointment for me.

1593272774|5.0|I have this book and the wheeled wonders book, and I find them both equally fascinating and a pleasure to work on the many model ideas in the  books. There are a ton of ideas here, so you can work with whatever technic parts you have. I had a few parts from the kit \\"Lego Crazy Action Contraptions\\" that I had bought earlier, so I was able to build a few machines from this book. However looking at all the other pictures in this book, I was soon wanting more parts and hit the bricklink site as suggested by the author and publisher in amazon comments. The parts list and links to bricklink catalog put up by the author on his web page was super helpful. I have built several of the models in this book and the wheeled wonders book and they have all been a joy to work on. My 6 year old daughter enjoys building them as well with some guidance. I intend to keep enjoying models from this book for a long time to come, and hopefully this will spark some original ideas of my own. I will be getting the third idea book as well. Thank you, Isogawa san, for an excellent book.

1594202842|3.0|The book is a first-person narrative of how a \\"Chinese Mother\\" raised her two daughters. The author used the phrase \\"Chinese Mother\\" to differentiate the Chinese method of child rearing from the western method, a method in which children lead and parents follow, the exact opposite of how it is done in the Chinese culture.    If one wishes to have an idea of why Asians seem to do well at whatever they do, this is a book that may shed some light.    Author Amy Chua, of Chinese parents, and husband Jed (non observant Jew) are both Harvard graduates and both are law professors at Yale Law School. They have two daughters, Sophia (1993) and Lulu (1996).    Most of the book is devoted to detailing how the author pushed both of the children to excel in music - Sophia on the piano and Lulu with the violin.    For westerners, sometimes the force with which the author pushed the children could be considered child abuse. Daily practice up to six hours per sitting was the norm. There were times when the author would tell the children they are a disgrace or that they are no good.     It appears from the book that the children never watched television or used a computer just for fun. What seems striking was that Jed, the husband, a westerner, did not often speak up on behalf of the children. It was clear that mother and father showed a united front, in front of the children. If there were disagreements away from the children, the mother won, because she remained a Chinese Mother for most of the book.    Both children won accolades and wide recognition for their musicality. Sophia won a competition that allowed her to play at Carnegie Hall (Weill Recital Hall) and Lulu was so good, she auditioned for Juilliard and she had the opportunity to have played for two of the world's most sought-after violin teachers. She became the student of one of those teachers. Both excelled in school, but that subject was barely mentioned.    Even under the strict routines imposed by the author, therewas not much blow back from the children. All that changed for Lulu.  After an incident with a music teacher in Budapest (Lulu said the teacher did not know anything) Lulu began to push back at her mother. In the end Lulu, moved away from intense music, and began tennis. Her mother attempted to control that too, but Lulu told her she should back off because she may spoil tennis for her just as she did violin.    We in the west should be careful not to be judgmental, for just as we may recoil at some of the author's methods, it is also true she too could recoil at some of the western permissive tendencies.
B003ASLJO0|4.0|ANOTHER GOOD MOVIE BY CLINT EASTWOOD
B002JIEYLM|3.0|To me 1976's Technical Ecstasy is the weakest Ozzy-era Black Sabbath album, I don't think it's awful because it has a few interesting songs but I feel it's not Sabbath's best hour. Besides I enjoyed it's successor, 1978's Never Say Die a little more than I did this one. I know that this album along with Never Say Die was not particularly well received by fans no doubt because they were so different sounding, but I still enjoyed them for what they were; I certainly don't think those albums are all bad there's some good there too! It's not really viewed as a classic by many fans and the band themselves and it's easy to see why but I don't think the album is terrible and it is worth buying if you're a hardcore fan of Sabbath, just know what to expect, something different. I'm not going to claim that it is equally as good as say Master of Reality or Vol.4 but I can't deny that it's worth a listen.<br /><br />\\"Back Street Kids\\" was a terrific way to open up Technical Ecstasy, a killer rocking tune with a catchy chorus that stands out: \\"Nobody I know will ever take my rock'n'roll away from me!\\", good stuff. I believe Ozzy delivers a great and under-appreciated performance on \\"You Won't Change Me\\", not typical your typical Sabbath song, slower paced but very melodic, I quite like this one. I always found interesting how Bill Ward sings on \\"It's Alright\\", I've never been a big fan of the song but it's the first Sabbath song that Ozzy didn't sing on. It's a slow ballad with piano and it's very nice for what it is, I like the sound of Bill Ward's voice very much here. \\"Gypsy\\" is one of the better songs of the album, it's a memorable song and it sounds a little different form the usual Black Sabbath which is cool. \\"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\\" is a great track with more of that classic Sabbath sound fans are used to; I feel most fans will be able to enjoy this one. \\"Rock `N' Roll Doctor\\" is a good rock'n'roll sound that's a bit of a departure for Black Sabbath in terms of sound but is quite catchy and for the most part, it works. I liked \\"She's Gone\\", another slower song in the vein of \\"You Won't Change Me\\" but I could never get into \\"Dirty Women\\" somehow. The album is definitely less edgy than some of Sabbath's previous work at that point, Technical Ecstasy was not as heavy and the sound was not as powerful as previous work which makes it a bit of an outcast along with Never Say Die.<br /><br />I fall somewhere between the two. My opinion is mixed because while it doesn't have that heavy Sabbath sound and some songs aren't too great, it has a good sound of its own and there are some songs worth listening to. Some fans enjoy Technical Ecstasy much more than others but if you give a try I'm sure there is some content you'll like. Not a masterpiece or one of Sabbath's better albums but neither is it awful or terrible; it's just not what fans were used to I suppose. It might be harder to get into this one because the first few Sabbath albums grabs you immediately. Rating: 3/5.is quite catchy and for the most part, it works.

B00013RC8O|3.0|I saw this movie long time ago when it first came out in early 70s. I remember likeing this movie then, but could not remember much of the movie details. When I saw it this time I was less impressed. Dodge Challanger was an inpresive car then and is now, and I wish I could afford to buy one now. The acting was good, but I did not like the ending. I am now a different person 40 years older and I may not like now what I liked then. All and All this movie is OK, not great.
B000002KIK|3.0|When you look back at the Black Sabbath recordings there are some albums that are looked at as being better than others and some that seem a little odd and out of place. Never Say Die fits into that second category, with its mixture of hard-rock and jazz it has a unique and interesting sound but not one that is Black Sabbath. Released two years after 1976's Technical Ecstasy (which was a bit of a departure for the band), Never Say Die was probably not the sound the fans expected to hear in 1978. NSD is often upon as being one of the worst Sabbath albums and one that is not worth hearing. I'm not saying that it is one of Black Sabbath's best albums, there are much better Ozzy and no Ozzy-eras albums, but it is a different one that I think is worth a listen. I never expected fans to like this one, in fact I was skeptical about the album myself when I first bought it. I'll admit the overall sound of the album can sound experimental to fans and it probably is because it has different musical elements thrown in that are not typical Sabbath. In fact, it's probably why so many fans didn't like it in the first place. I guess the problem is that it sounds so different from other Black Sabbath albums, it simply doesn't have that classic Black Sabbath sound fans love (myself included). Even the album cover art is far from your typical Sabbath cover; it's rather odd but cool at the same time. Interestingly enough, Ozzy's voice on NSD sounds closer to his solo beginnings than it sounded on previous Sabbath albums which is not a bad thing.<br /><br />The title track is an undeniable classic, it has a sound that works well with earlier Sabbath and is quite edgy. Johnny Blade\\" is one of the few songs that fans seem to like from this album, good track. \\"Junior's Eyes\\" is to me the highlight of Never Say Die, the lyrics and chorus are amazing to me very clever and despite the Jazzy drums it's a rock' n 'roll song, Ozzy shows a lot of emotion with his voice here. I actually like \\"Hard Road\\", yes it sound perhaps too happy -go-lucky for Black Sabbath but it has a cool vibe and it's a underrated song. \\"Shock Wave\\" is not one of the best songs here but it works and it's a good song with a cool chorus. \\"Air Dance\\" is just about the farthest you can go from the classic Ozzy-era Sabbath sound  and it's probably why I like it so much, because it's that different and brilliant. Air Dance has quite the Jazz sound and the piano work is incredible, clever lyrics, Ozzy's voice is terrific here. Unlike many fans I like \\"Over To You\\", nothing special about the song in particular as nothing stands out but it's a good track. \\"Breakout\\" is just this crazy swing big band instrumental thing that is far out, perhaps a bit too much to digest for the average Sabbath fan. I'm not really into that one and it is the weakest song here.  \\"Swinging The Chain\\" is sung by Bill Ward, not awful by any means but its pretty much \\"just there\\", nothing special about this one at all I'm afraid.<br /><br />Never Say Die is not your typical Sabbath album as I mentioned before, but if you give it a chance and accept that it's a \\"different\\" album you might like it. I don't think it's an exceptional album but I find plenty to like. I think Never Say Die is often judged without being heard because it has this reputation of being a bad album and the late 70's was not an especially great era for Black Sabbath. Yes it's different, that' why it's interesting and why I like it so much, the band experimented and had this cool trippy drugged and jazzy vibe that you either love or hate. Some songs obviously worked better than others but overall it's a great experiment that any Sabbath fan with an open mind should give a listen. Personally I enjoyed this one more than Technical Ecstasy.  3.5 /5.yes it sound perhaps too happy -go-lucky for Black Sabbath but it has a cool vibe and it's a underrated song. \\"Shock Wave\\" is not one of the best songs here but it works and it's a good song with a cool chorus. \\"Air Dance\\" is just about the farthest you can go from the classic Ozzy-era Sabbath sound  and it's probably why I like it so much, because it's that different and brilliant.

B004AHNIGM|3.0|Gregg Allman is a talented artist. His contributions to American music stand the test of time. His shows are well attended, his bands are full of excellent, soulful musicians. That said, I just don't hear a lot of Mr. Allman's genuine originality showing through T-Bone's patented production. The trademark of Allman's career has been beautiful original songs and one-of-a-kind interpretations of songs by other artists. What I don't hear in this collection is Allman's unique ability to arrange and re-interpret songs. Yes, he's playing some of his old faves and with his friends; I'm left with the feeling that someone dubbed his voice over boiler plate arrangements, the quality of his backing band notwithstanding (I'd gladly pay to see them live). I've bought every album he's made, but this isn't one of the ones I'm going to keep. I am delighted, however, to see him in good health and touring again.
B001FB4W16|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv.  Great cast, great story.  Even if you've already read the SOUTHERN VAMPIRE series, you will love this show.  The tv version is based on the novels with just enough differences to keep you coming back show after show.... Love it.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|Greg Allman's got the voice to sing the blues and his deep,sometimes raspy voice is perfect for this wide range of blues songs  by such classic folks ranging from Muddy Waters to Otis Rush. Joining Allman is the Allman Brothers Band that plays with extraordinary skill particularly on the lone new song by Allman and Warren Haynes. The sets  range from slow tempo to more up beat, the slow is exemplified by the opener  'Floating Bridge' but is picked by the next song \\"Little by Little\\"  with a foot stomping, hand clapping beat. The tempo interchanges like this often throughout the album. My favorite covers are \\"Little by Little\\", 'Tears,Tears, Tears\\"  (Tears in my eyes, Blue as I can be, Just had another woman walk out on me\\"), and \\"My Love is Your Love'. \\"My Love\\" features Allman at his blues best backed by a great blues guitar riff that breaks in after his vocal. The best song is Allman & Haynes \\"Just Another Rider\\", that is great musically, excellent vocals and great lyrics (\\"Just another rider, on that train to nowhere\\"}. The guitar blues solo on this song is fantastic and complements Allman and the rest of the band opens up.  TB Burnett repeats some of his bare bone style, although not as limiting as Mellencamp's recent album particularly noticed on a slight country sounding \\"I can't Be Satisfied' (Muddy Waters) and in particularly \\"Rolling Stone\\". Oddly on 'Rolling Stone', the dominant heavy percussion, heavy  bass play with a light twang of a guitar reminds of Lennon's old Plastic Ono Band reinforced by he repetitiveness of the beat. Overall, I am pleased with the album because Allman sounds great and I really think the song \\"Just Another Rider' is outstanding.

B004KPQK2S|5.0|I have enjoyed horse movies all my life, I've seen the classics, and those that did not do well in box office sales.  I have a passion for horses, but even more so, a passion for that connection between horse and human.  Secretariat provides a great story line with stellar cast, it is inspiring, heart-warming, and offers a rare glimpse into what horses can do when they are directed and supported rather than forced.  The heart of the horse is an amazing thing and in this movie we get to see a horse who runs with all his heart - and - loves it.    I am not sure how much children would enjoy it, there are a lot of adult issues Penny faces (the passing of her parents, tension with her husband and brother, and walking straight into a clearly male-dominated world.)  On the other hand, I think it's quite inspiring for girls to see a woman standing up for her convictions, living her life with the same heart Secretariat ran his races.      I was impressed with the attention to detail, the cinematography, and the edge-of-your-seat anticipation during racing scenes (even though we already knew how history played out!)      My only cons are I wish there was more about Secretariat's character so we could get to know him better as did Eddie Sweat who was said to have spent the most time with him, and, what I felt were some cheezy family scenes.  But then again, I am more interested in the genuine heart and character of the horse than I am in what Hollywood makes of a story, so this may be merely personal preference.  For true stories I rely on documentaries and books.    Bottom line:  I recommend this film, it is inspiring and encouraging, honoring the beautiful spirit of the horse and the indomitable spirit of the people who believed in him.      You run your race, you *let* him run his. - wise words from Penny's father, a man who understood the heart of the horse

B003EY7IRC|5.0|KMM does it again, This was a absolute can not put it down had to finish it book! A day and a half straight thru.  With out spoiling it, girl gets boy,I'll take one too.  Dublin was saved sorta, and the bad guys got theirs sorta the villian(s)I thought there were more then one,well could have been squashed more but Can't say more;get yours and read it but not without reading the others in the series first or you will be lost.  KMM is going to have a problem(not??) coming out with a new series to equal this one.  Please tell me you are. Please,please.  Now kindle prices,yes they are high and the publishers are greedy.  It is worse at their web sites.  I do hope the author(s) are getting their fair share as their talent,midnight oil etc. is what birth's these creations and publishers are a necessary evil.  Each book is a piece of the author's heart and soul.  I paint and can hardly bare to sell a painting.  I would rather gift to a friend ,as with each picture goes a bit of me.  Remember e books are greener,clutter free(my house could be a lending library) and that kindle holds lots and lots of books. Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6\\" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology. This is the model I got along with the leather case with built in light. I am loving it,my brother is loving his too.  Be sure to take advantage of the free books,check them every month.  I will be slowly replacing my rereaders with kindle versions,yes I know double purchase but the room I gain is worth it.  I donate the hardbacks to the local library. I do not mind supporting the authors,this is their bread and butter.  We don't buy they don't make a living
B004G600A4|5.0|Its hard to get my daughter to watch anything for more than 30 minutes or so, and the first few trips to the theatre ended with us leaving before the movie ended, but not before the fidgeding and talking, etc., began, but Tangled had Ella from the start.  She was just entranced with this movie and begged to go back, which she sat silently through again!  Its seriously a miracle for my girl to sit quietly through a movie in a theatre twice ever, which goes to show how much she loves it.  Anyways, it is by far our favorite version of Repunzel, our favorite new Disney Princess and current movie for her.  I also loves the focus on the male lead, not just the female, and his background and growth during the film.  The musical scores were brilliant and catchy and I fell in love with the soundtrack myself.  I can't wait to pick the dvd up for \\"her\\" when it comes out in March!  We absolutly love it and highly recommend it to every little girl, boy and just about anyone actually.  I don'y know who wouldn'y love this movie!

0385501560|2.0|color me confused.  i am over 100 pages in and i cannot take it anymore.  my g/f gave it to me for christmas insisting i would like it.   total yawn fest.  another reviewer said its not for people with a queezy stomach, i dont see how that holds true.  another said it is very sexually explicit.  maybe, if you've never watched cable television before.  the writing style is annoyingly simplistic. see spot run, run spot run. that is what it feels like i'm reading, only slightly more humorous. i'm not interested in giving it anymore opportunity.   shrug.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I guess I really like this show because I was a smarty pants in high school and college. But the writing on this show is phenomenal! This show is so stinkin' hilarious. I mean, the show has produced a friendship algorithm t-shirt for crying out loud! Between Big Bang Theory and Modern Family, my weekly comedy hunger is certainly fed!
B003VANOFY|2.0|Headset is great, except there is no noise cancellation at all. It appears to be driver related as the voice morphing software actually causes noise cancellation. Seriously, if you email support about this they will say it noise cancellation only works with voice morphing.    If you hold your push to talk and say nothing you will get a constant buzzing sound going out to any users listening. If you turn voice morphing on and do the same thing, it's clear as day.    There's actually a thread on this forming about people considering a class action lawsuit. [...]    If you value a great microphone, I do not recommend this. Only reason why I'm bearing with this headset is because I love the sound it puts out and if you set the voice activation on Ventrilo to 1 second silence time my friend said its not very noticeable. Skype is a different story though. You also may encounter other driver issues that this headset has but there are work-arounds for it in the support forums.
B004HYDL1K|1.0|I normally dig Rodriguez/Tarintino flicks, but this one was just awful. Too political, the plot was over the top. Basicly just a two hour violence and sex fest with lousy storyline. Ashamed that DeNiro would even be in a piece of crap like this. Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan are two of the worst actresses in the history of cinema.
B0000042MY|5.0|Even without knowing the  movie - which is terrific - you could listen to this music and feel its poignant beauty. It's not a bombastic track, but it's an effective track that complements the film's arc but can also be enjoyed independently. If you like soundtracks, I'd highly recommend it.
B004HE5PVO|1.0|My son loves legos and plays with them for hours.  He bought this with birthday money and after building it he stood back and was so disappointed due to how small it is and how little you get for the money!  Lego needs to stop ripping kids and families off and expand thier sets OR appropriately price them! This is happening more and more with legos these days. Really sad...
1594488843|5.0|Mr. Pink brings to life a concept that we all know within our own lives but seem to often forget when we are asked to manage others.  One simple question: why do people develop skills or hobbies, especially when they are not paid for them?  Mr. Pink answers this question with his concepts of Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose.  His answers are straight-forward, quickly covered within the pages of this book and can be supplemented by his video on ted.com.    I highly recommend this book for anyone who manages or leads an organization.  Mr. Pink's insights have already helped me try to become a better manager by specifically looking to understand what team members really want from their work.  It is amazing to see what a team can do when you begin to harness their own sense of purpose and give them some autonomy over how to master their own work.  It is also useful to use this same frame to see when someone is not in a role where they can achieve mastery or purpose and help them quickly move onto some other work.  We all spend too much time working to not have the opportunity for Autonomy, Purpose and Mastery in what we do.    Please read this book and then work with your teams to see what it would take to achieve this in your company.
B004G6009U|5.0|Absolutely ranks with the best of Disney animated feature films.  Funny, charming, poignant, typically great tunes, etc.  By the way, my wife and I are 66 years of age and our children have long moved away.

B0019EXZY4|5.0|I really enjoy heist movies; the take and the target, the colorful characters, and the inevitable plot twist all make for a great story. It was with these expectations that I went into \\"The Bank Job,\\" whose title spells heist movie if there ever was one. What I found, however, was a heist movie dedicated not to an elegant robbery, but instead to retelling one of the most elaborate coverups of the 20th century.    Set in 1970s London, the movie's central plot revolves around scandalous photographs taken and held as blackmail by an unpopular civil rights activist. Believed to be located in a safe deposit box in the vault of a Baker Street bank, British officials seek to recover the photographs by indirectly hiring disposable thieves to break into the bank.    While these photographs are introduced as the primary conflict, the movie's overall plot is made far more complex through the introduction of other side characters who bring with them their own individual interests. Such a large number of characters and a diversity of stories operating simultaneously might normally bog a movie down, however, \\"The Bank Job\\" largely avoids doing this by lightly bouncing between its many individual conflicts, and by slowly allowing its characters to develop. By the end of the movie, what was supposed to be a typical bank heist movie instead becomes much more.    Jason Statham stars as Terry, an amiable middle class mechanic. When presented with what he believes to be a no-risk, high reward opportunity, Terry assembles a crew of equally opportunistic amateur thieves to pillage a London bank of its untold riches. Each of these characters is the make-up of a colorful personality one might expect to find in a heist movie, and it is because of these personalities that the movie functions the way it does. High tech gear is replaced by shovels and a very loud jackhammer; keen criminal intellect is replaced by humorous ignorance. These characters are after nothing more than the quick scorethat the job will provide, and as such it is only Terry that begins to suspect that his team's involvement might have larger, more dangerous ramifications.    By the end of the movie, Terry and his crew of misfits find themselves at a standoff with British government officials, a ruthless kingpin, and crooked cops, all wanting what's theirs.    Jason Statham performs admirably in this movie. Rather than the fearless, physical action star he's cast as in many of his other movies, in \\"The Bank Job\\" he by contrast is a much more normal character mixed up in abnormal circumstances. He is the central figure in this movie, and it is his dialogue and actions that largely drive most of the second half of the movie.     \\"The Bank Job\\" is a heist movie like no other, whose plot involves much more than a \\"get rich\\" scheme by its main characters. Instead, through a series of overlapping stories, the movie develops as a cool, intelligent retelling of an event still largely shrouded in myth. This movie is a must-see for those who love heists, intelligent action sequences, and an unpredictable series of events.
031603438X|4.0|Fascinating book, pages fly by.  But Keith goes on about two chapters too long.  He should have ended the book about the time he quit heroin for good, the rest of the book is not up the the previous sections.  Even so, it's a great read.

B0034G4OUO|5.0|Films like Faster have been lacking for mainstream cinema for almost a decade now. Now that Arnie and Sly have retired a new hero was needed. Arise The Rock. It took him time to get here after making films for kids I feel this type of roles best suit him. He did display something similar in the first 10 minutes of welcome to the Jungle. More of the same please! This is a film for all the men out there who like action films that kick ass.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|The Beatles Box Set was a gift for my husband.  He had taken an interest in the Beatles in the past year and had been purchasing their cd's regularly.  After hearing about the box set it was immediately on his Christmas wish list.  He loved getting it as a gift because it took him almost an entire day to load it onto the computer, go through all of the cd covers and look at all of the pictures.  For someone who didn't grow up with the Beatles, this is an excellent way to get to know them and learn more about what our parents are always saying was the best music ever.
0451191153|1.0|How can no one be disturbed by the scene in which the paragon of virtue, Howard Roarke rapes the heroine?  Then she falls in love with him? Maybe people believed this tripe back in the thirties, but I hope most of society has learned better by now.  Maybe instead of debating DR Albert Ellis, Ayne Rand should have seen him as a patient.
B001WCN23W|5.0|If you have never heard this album just go out and buy it i think anybody that loves music should have this album.  Brown sugar is a classic of course.  Sway is a awesome song.  Wild horses is one of the most beautiful songs ever made.  Cant you hear me knocking has a wonderful riff and one of the best songs on the album.  You gotta move is pure blues with a killer slide guitar.  Bitch is a catchy song.  I got the blues is another favorite of mine and i love the horns in that song.  Sister morphine is awesome and ry cooder plays slide guitar on that song.  Dead flowers and moonlight mile are both killers songs this is one of the best stones albums ever i could hear this album over and over again and never get sick of it.  I cant see anybody disliking this album its beautifully made.

B0009P66TK|5.0|Love the size of this watch... it is BIG as stated.    I was looking for a old style military watch and this fit the bill for the price.    Strap is nice leather, I have a few replica Breitling watches for twice the price that have a strap nowhere near as good.    All the functions are accurate, I have not noticed any loss of time.    My only quip would be that the trijicon (might be wrong type) used for the night-glow is weak, and I find that the only way to get it glowing brightly is direct flashlight exposure for 30 seconds.

B003VANOFY|5.0|So far I have had this wireless headset a little over 2 months and have not had a single problem with it.    I wanted the wirelss with a good microphone because of online games, and this has held up admirably.    My last pair of headphones simply fell apart where the earpeice joins with the head strap, these are durable and comfortable for extended periods of time.    I read a few reviews of this headset for people experiencing loss of connection (wireless) and signal noise/static    I have none of those complaints and have never had the wireless signal drop from the headset to the base (even when walking into the bathroom or bedroom +30 feet away).    For any gamer looking for a decently priced wireless headset with surround sound audio AND a great sounding microphone look at this set.    Also the wireless is just icing on the cake!
0446563048|5.0|Few companies have gotten as much publicity over the past few years as Zappos. Although before I dug into this book I knew that the company was widely regarded as a customer service icon, after reading it I now know why. As social media opens doors for customers, vendors and employees to talk even more loudly about an experience with a company, it becomes even more important to go above and beyond in your dealings with each.<br /><br />Tony Hsieh built a retail powerhouse on the backs of talkative (and very happy) customers, vendors and employees and this book provides a road map for companies who want to do the same.

B003XMKMTQ|3.0|This first Crossroads concert is the third one I've seen behind 2007 and 2010. I liked both and wondered what the first one would be like. Well, I think it's more raw than the others which is probably stating the obvious. Not as many artists but much more bluesy than the others. It's great to see the development of the concert over the 3 DVDs. Excellent to see all those wonderful blues guys on stage at every opportunity. If you like great guitarists that have their roots in the blues, you'll love this.
B004I11VZ0|4.0|I was lucky enough to get an advance copy of this new film starring Donnie Yen (You may remember him from \\"Hero\\") entirely in Cantonese with English subtitles which will be out in theaters in the U.S. and Canada on January 28th. Donnie Yen is reprising his role here as the real-life kung fu grandmaster Ip man in this martial arts film. I never saw the original but apparently in it, he escaped the Japanese occupation of his hometown and with his pregnant wife and family have moved to Hong Kong which is living under British colonial rule.<br /><br />Ip Man begins his life in Hong Kong barely making ends meet renting an apartment and trying to start a martial arts school to teach his Wing Chun style. He is challenged by several neighborhood ruffians who eventually grudgingly give him respect and ask to serve under him as students. Being a kind-hearted man and pleased with the opportunity to teach, he does not push them very hard for their student fees knowing they are also struggling financially under British rule. His school is put up against other martial arts schools in the area competitively and they all clash and fight with territorialism. Eventually all the schools must unite together in order to face the British for their honor.<br /><br />The British are demanding payments from the schools in return for allowing them to stay open (like offering \\"protection\\" in gangster movies). The British do not respect the Chinese and often ridicule them in public. A Western-style boxer named Taylor \\"Twister\\" Milos comes to town to fight and entertain the British and by mocking and insulting the Chinese martial arts demonstration opening act, Ip must step up to defend the honor of his people and his own kung fu, Wing Chun.<br /><br />I know that was a lot of summary, but it seemed needed to really get across the themes in this movie. This film is a delightful throwback to the good ol' days of kung fu. Though I love the wire martial arts styles in films like \\"Hero\\", \\"House of Flying Daggers\\", \\"Fearless\\", and \\"Iron Monkey\\", classic kung fu battles of men hitting and kicking each other in defense of their homes, family, country, honor, etc. still are a pleasure to watch. I loved Donnie Yen in \\"Hero\\" (basically loved EVERYTHING about that movie) and it was so enjoyable to see him in this role and to find out it was based on a real person's story who eventually went on to train a young Bruce Lee. Wow! This probably won't be a very wide release in the U.S., but if you happen to see it is in your area and you love martial arts movies, go have a fun afternoon in the theater! Yes, you will have to read subtitles, but that's ok. I felt like I could have watched the entire movie muted without subtitles and still understood easily what was going on since everything is so physical not only in the fighting scenes but in acting and reacting in conversation.rless\\", and \\"Iron Monkey\\", classic kung fu battles of men hitting and kicking each other in defense of their homes, family, country, honor, etc. still are a pleasure to watch.

030746363X|4.0|The by-line on the book cover, \\"An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman,\\" is clearly tongue-in-cheek, but the author, Tim Ferriss is an interesting guy, to say the least.  He seems intent on being a human guinea pig, and lucky for us he's articulate enough for us to enjoy the ride vicariously through his experiences.  This book didn't change my life, but it did make me consider and reconsider some aspects of my life and how I'll approach and attempt to solve current and future concerns.  Definitely worth picking up and reading - even if you skip the sections that aren't interesting to you personally.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|\\"How I Met Your Mother\\" Season 2 continues the story of Ted's search for his future bride and mother of his children. All cast members return including Josh Radnor, Jason Segel, Alyson Hannigan, Cobie Smulders (yes she DOES), and Neil Patrick Harris as well as Bob Saget narrating as older Ted Mosby. Spoiler Alert! At the end of Season 1, Lily and Marshall broke up. At the end of Season 2 is one of the best television weddings I have ever seen. Also at the end of Season 1, Ted and Robin got together despite fundamental differences in their future paths. I won't spoil what happens to them by the end....<br /><br />This is a funny season where the \\"Slap Bet\\" originates wherein Marshall earns the right to slap Barney at five times, whenever he chooses. We also get to see Lily act in a terrible play and Barney respond with his own terrible one man show about a robot finding love with a toaster. Robin's past as a pop star in Canada comes back to haunt her! Ted after Lily comes to work with him temporarily finally gets the guts to show off his better architecture design to his boss and has lots of issues with leadership at work throughout the season. Barney meets his match in a cougar played by Jane Seymour. And of course with a wedding on the way there are plenty of memorable moments to be had at a bridal shower, bachelor party, the wedding, and Marshall saying goodbye to the end of an era -- his Fiero car that breaks down before hitting 200,000 miles and all the defining moments that car created. And the gang isn't able to watch the Super Bowl live and frantically try to avoid finding out any news about the outcome so they can watch it recorded together.<br /><br />The show has eased into a comfortable place where you can enjoy the characters after Marshall undergoes suffering and then Lily is made to pay until the two can gradually reconcile. You know already Robin isn't the mother so it's just a waiting game for her and Ted to break it off. Bob Saget is an excellent narrator! Definitely check this show out, I'm sold on it now. The wedding was sooo sweet! And you know I don't like too much touchy feely stuff.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There is a seven minute gag reel, the funniest moments of which involve several \\"almost\\" kisses between random cast members. \\"How I Made Your Mother\\" ended up being a pretty great making of showing rehearsals all the way to final cuts through the episode. What made it great was it turns out in that episode where there was a proposal, it was REAL. It was set up for these two fans of the show who knew the makers were put in the background as extras and the proposal was written into the scene and the woman getting proposed to didn't know it so it was a genuine reaction! How cool is that? Did NOT know!ly check this show out, I'm sold on it now. The wedding was sooo sweet! And you know I don't like too much touchy feely stuff.

0399536108|4.0|As someone who has read lots of Chris's writing and seen him speak, the magic of what he does continues to astound me. His thoughts aren't groundbreaking, and his writing is simple and devoid of flashy flourish.<br /><br />The magic of Chris is contained in the fact that his plain speaking and writing create a feeling; a feeling of possibility, a feeling of hope, and implicit encouragement. I've seen him pack bookstores and watched him gather a huge following on the strength of this ability to inspire hope and calm.<br /><br />But it wouldn't be enough if he just made us feel good. The emotional resonance of what Chris has to say seems almost guaranteed to move people to action in the path of realizing their dreams. I know of many people who, after reading Chris' material, made major changes in their work and life, and have, in all cases that I know of, realized significant success afterward. I include myself in this group, and count myself lucky that I came across Chris' material when I did.<br /><br />Were it not for Chris, I can safely say I would still be struggling to climb the ladder in the corporate world, and unclear about the intermediate and short-term steps that would move me towards a more pleasing and fulfilling alternative.<br /><br />If you are looking for a positive change in your life, and you have yet to be exposed to Chris, you owe it to yourself to take a tour through his work, starting with this book. Then visit his blog and download some of his free eBooks, including the excellent \\"279 Days to Overnight Success\\" which I consider the best manifesto for the self-employed that I have ever read.<br /><br />Thanks Chris, and keep rocking the universe.
B0019CSXAM|4.0|\\"How I Met Your Mother\\" continues the search for the mother in Season 3, but doesn't try very hard. After Lily played by Alyson Hannigan and Marshall played by Jason Segal got married at the end of season 2, they start looking for their own apartment to live in and think about the future. Marshall tries to find just the right job and is finally exposed to the mountain of Lily's debt that he has been saddled with. Ted played by Josh Radnor and Robin played by Cobie Smulders are no longer dating and things are tense between them all season. Barney played by Neil Patrick Harris continues to be AWESOME, but starts to develop feelings for Robin.<br /><br />This season was the season of guest stars! Starting with Enrique Iglesias (\\"Would you dance....if I asked you to dance...\\") as a boyfriend Robin picks up while on vacation, James Van Der Beek as Robin's ex she never got over, Heidi Klum playing herself, Sarah Chalke of \\"Scrubs\\" playing Stella who is Ted's new major love interest of the season, and Britney Spears plays Abby who is a receptionist in love with Ted and manipulated by Barney. Ted is occasionally a horrible person in this season and his behavior often contradicts his lofty goals and morality of past seasons.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The \\"Series Retrospective\\" is a great sum-up of the first two seasons narrated by Bob Saget as older Ted. Lily & Marshall's Honeymoon videos are pretty cute and home video authentic which makes me wonder if they were originally supposed to incorporated into some episodes, but they made a great extra. The \\"Cast Favorites\\" Featurette is where each cast member tells what their favorite episode is and why.<br /><br />Behind the Scenes of \\"We're Not From Here\\" Featurette is just like the last two seasons where they kind of show the process of getting from the read-through, to rehearsal, to run-through, to rolling for the episode. For the additional scenes: How It Really Happened just shows the extended and deleted scenes from episodes.<br /><br />The \\"You Just Got Slapped\\" music video is just Marshall behind a piano being very serious and does not feature NPH. The \\"Sandcastles in the Sand\\" music video is just as awesome as \\"Let's Go To The Mall\\". The Gag Reel once again does not disappoint and includes a random makeout session between Marshall, Lily, and Barney and the actual words yelled during Lily and Marshall's fight that had been dubbed over in a previous episode and features more music from The Solids. The \\"Ted Mosby is a Jerk\\" Audio Track is playing during \\"The Bracket\\" episode because Barney once posed as Ted Mosby to sleep with a girl and confronts her and she made a website called TedMosbyisaJerk.com. It's a weird slow song playing with girls being mad at Ted while subtitles of the show dialogue appear in black.<br /><br />There is commentary on \\"The Platinum Rule\\", \\"Ten Sessions\\", \\"The Bracket\\", \\"The Chain of Screaming\\", \\"Sandcastles in the Sand\\", \\"Everything Must Go\\", and \\"Miracles\\" and they split up individual actors again and also have Sarah Chalke with Josh Radnor for \\"Ten Sessions.\\"Just Got Slapped\\" music video is just Marshall behind a piano being very serious and does not feature NPH.

1423113381|4.0|This book was a strong start to a great new series! No, it was not as good as the Percy Jackson books, but personally, I don't think Riordan will ever top those (but I haven't read the Lost Hero yet so we'll see...). He didn't clone characters or situations-everything was new and fresh and it didn't feel like an Egyptian Percy Jackson. I did enjoy it, though, and I'll recommend it to many people... AFTER Percy Jackson, of course!
B003O86FMW|5.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" is the second book in a trilogy of the \\"Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins. The hardcover copy is 391 pages long while the Kindle e-version is a 479 Kb download.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br /><br />After winning the 'Hunger Games', Katniss and Peeta return home to district 12 as heroes and then soon depart on a victory tour of all the other remaining 11 Districts. However in doing so, they become aware of a growing discontent in the subordinate districts; discontent which was precipitated by some of their rebellious actions during the 'games'. To make matters worse, ( from a Capital viewpoint)  the tour has only served to fan the fires of the slow smouldering resistance movement.<br /><br />The leader of the Capitol region, President Snow, decides to come down hard on those districts that are causing trouble. And to show the rebels that he is in complete control, he elects to put previous 'Hunger Game' winners back in the arena for the Quell Tournament (a special 'Hunger Game' held every 25 years). Not surprisingly, Katniss and Peeta return once again for a second go-round in the dreaded arena. However, things do not go completely according to plans...neither for the President nor the previous winners.<br /><br />*END SPOILER*<br /><br />In a setting reminiscent of Orwell's \\"1984\\", Author Collins has done a masterful job of turning what superficially appears to be, for all intents and purposes, a Young Adult story, into a tense, emotional and violent tale that will appeal to all lovers of fantasy/action stories.<br /><br />The main protagonist here is Katniss, a girl of about 17 years old. Collins develops her character by making the reader aware of almost every thought that Katniss is thinking...we see her likes, her immaturity, her fears and her growing distrust and hatred for 'the system' that is the government of the Capitol district.<br /><br />We witness her personality change as she is thrust into unwanted situations; where she must grow up fast, make split-second life and death decisions...and do all this while being fully aware that all her actions are being watched by the authorities. Actions that could bring dire consequences to her family, friends and loved ones, should the insult be deemed great enough in the eyes of those in power.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Truly a book I could hardly bear to put down. This second book ends with an obvious tie into the 3rd and final book. 5 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholsonke split-second life and death decisions...and do all this while being fully aware that all her actions are being watched by the authorities.

1451539401|4.0|Recently I read Austen's 'juvenalia', and when I started reading this book, I could see a lot of similarities. The beginning of S&S has a tone of satire. The reader can tell Jane is a young writer, mocking many of society's views which were common at the time.<br /><br />However, as the story progresses, I began to see Jane getting more serious about her subject and caring about her characters. That was when I began to love this book. And it just got better and better toward the end.<br /><br />On a personal note, I found some similarities to my own life in this book. When I was young and in love for the first time, I acted a bit like Marianne, wearing my heart on my sleeve. I think many of us probably did.  I loved this book and gave it 4 stars - but you can see how I might be a biased reader.<br /><br />Some of Austen's other books are definitely a little better, but this is also a good book.  It's amazing to me that hundreds of years can pass, and a modern reader like me can still identify with these characters.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I got the CD of \\"Wicked\\" to play to my classes.  I am a School Counselor and I am using the Broadway Musical to help stop bullying.  They have a wonderful site bullybust.com that they are working to help kids who are bullied. But I have found myself listening to the CD more than I let my students listen to it.  It is great and I am SO glad I purchased it.  I got the CD in record time and was able to use it very quickly from the time of purchase.  I am very pleased that I purchased it from Amazon.
1936594390|5.0|Wow. This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.<br /><br />Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.<br /><br />I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!<br /><br />Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature.

B003BLPTB0|2.0|I read many positive reviews on Crocs clogs, these looked like the best looking ones. The main purpose was for use at work in a clinical setting where I am on my feet for 12 hours. These shoes do not provide enough support and are not very comfortable; they also feel either too cold or too hot depending if you are walking or standing still and after working a couple of shifts I can honestly say that I won't be using them for work. $50 was wasted so I will find use for these Crocs around the house and maybe around the pool in the summer. Overall disappointed, and going back to sneakers for my long shifts at the hospital.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|This is just a tremendous double album. Having watched the documentary \\"The Making Of Darkness...\\" the album really came alive for me. (The documentary was a fascinating insight into Bruce's almost Mozartian obsession with his music to the exclusion of all else.)  If you like any of Bruce Springsteen's music new or old, you'll not regret buying this. It's a collection of very different songs, different vibes, different themes (even if the word \\"Tonight\\" permeates many of the lyrics!).  Despite the limitations of the recording process in 1978, the sound quality is excellent, with a powerful drum sound and a clean, strong vocal from Bruce.  Play it often, and play it LOUD.
B0042EJD8A|4.0|GASLAND was totally shocking to me.  I had no idea the problems explored in the film even existed.  I decided to watch GASLAND with a good friend because it was nominated for an Oscar this year, and I had seen all but one of the other nominated films.  Through much of the film my mouth hung open in total disbelief.  How could anyone, particularly local, state and the Federal government allow such things to happen?  And is the potentially toxic ramifications of natural gas drilling yet another argument for stronger government oversight or regulation?     GASLAND is generally excellent filmmaking.  I have only one area of concern: I wish Mr. Fox had spent a little time offering an alternative to the harmful natural gas drilling discussed in his film.  I say this because all the stories of people harmed by the drilling were overwhelmingly depressing, so it would have been nice to hear some alternatives.  Also, let's face it, we all use natural gas to heat our homes, cook our food, heat our water, etc.  Are we willing to give it up?  If so, what would we be giving it up for?  This would have been a perfect film if time had been devoted to answering those questions.
B003YGSLDA|2.0|I read many of the reviews and they were all for the dvd version of the movie.  I ordered the blu ray version and it did not work on my blu ray player.  I returned the movie thinking that maybe something was wrong with the disc and when I received the replacement it still did not work. I had my husband look at it and I guess it was something about the region of the disc where it only plays in certain countries.  I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and I was so excited to find that it was on blu ray.  Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it on blu ray so I opted for the dvd version.  Loved the movie, but wish I could have experienced it on blu ray.
B0010ZR160|3.0|This film is gripping and I enjoyed it from start almost to finish. I just have one question: Why does Hollywood treat the viewers like they're idiots?<br /><br />The main character commits murder (he shoots the pedophile in the head, and then complains that he doesn't feel right about it) and yet he gets away with it. He doesn't turn himself in.  At the same time, he's on his moral high horse about returning the child to her family and her \\"real\\" mother's right to have her daughter back--and the movie makes it clear that she is a lousey mother who doesn't care about her daughter's wellbeing in the least.<br /><br />What I don't like is being treated like I am stuid; I can handle all kinds of suspension of disbelief when watching a great movie, but not this kind of contradiction, which renders the main character's actions completel unbelievable. This film isn't about moral ambiguity: it's about a moral contradiction that I cannot believe is possible in the character. He's willing to lose his sweetheart in order to \\"do the right thing,\\" he's willing to put the little girl back into a horrible home situation, but he gets away with murder??? I don't think so.

B002ZG9940|5.0|This is George Clooney's best acting performance, probably ever.  Filmed on location in Castel Del Montel, Italy, it provides a beautiful background to a tense, very detailed (special rifle construction) story of a contract killer with a conscience. It has a slower pace than most Hollywood movies,but one is easily absorbed in the story.
1439152780|5.0|Edie Burchill's life becomes entwined in the lives of three elderly sisters at a country castle called Milderhurst when her mother receives a lost letter from one of the sisters. Her mother's letter from one of the sisters sends Edie on a journey wherein she discovers the secrets from her own mother's past but also the secrets that are buried at the ancient castle.    Edie works at a small publishing company in London and she loves a book called \\"The Secret History of the Mud Man\\" which she read when she was a little girl.  The sisters at Milderhurst Castle are the children of the author of \\"The Secrets of the Mudman\\".    \\"The Distant Hours\\" hauntingly tells the story of Edie's mother and the intriguing and sad story of the inhabitants of Milderhurst.  The story moves between the late 1930's to 1940's during World War II and the 1990's when Edie visits the sisters at Milderhurst Castle.    \\"The Distant Hours\\" leads the reader from present day back to the past as the author weaves a suspenseful and compelling mystery of the past and the present. Very compelling reading and a good mystery.
B000JMLKCG|5.0|I skimmed some of the longer descriptions of scenery/village life.  There was still plenty to stir my imagination.  This study of human character - especially that of Henchard - was very interesting.  Really enjoyed the book!
B00498YZH8|1.0|This is one of the most boring, slow moving movies I've ever seen.  I understand the raw concept of exposing drugs in the heartland, blah blah, blah, but this was dreadfully boring, could have been much better.  I'm sure a few artsy fartsy types will find this amusing, but my guess is that most Americans will not \\"get\\" this film and will be bored out of their minds.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I decided not to review each book as i read through this series as I was in too much of a hurry to see 'what happened next' and I also wanted to hold my opinion until this conclusion brought it all together.<br /><br />What a fabulous series - I do love sci fi - fae, witches, immortal beings and what incredible characters came together to bring a most enthralling story to a wonderful conclusion. Though I cannot help but feel that this is not really the end, 'Jericho and MacKayla' are too enduring to disappear into the shelves of library not to surface at least once more. And wouldnt we all love a 'Jericho' in our lives (thats the romantic in me coming out)!<br /><br />I won't ruin the story for others that have not yet read any or only some of this series but know that I have become a great fan of this author, I just love the descriptive way she rights and the spell she casts over the listeners as she brings them into the story and identify with different characters.<br /><br />I now look forward to reading the Highlandder series by this author as I am now hooked!

142314189X|5.0|I bought these books for my nine-year old son, Jake, after he read the first book in the series (\\"The Lightning Thief\\").  Unfortunately for Jake, I was drawn in myself!  He had to wait for me to finish each book in turn.<br /><br />This is a delightful series that blends elements of classical mythology, an updated setting, a kid's perspective and a fast-paced storyline, with a quest as the central driver of the narrative in each book.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Have never read anything like it.  Written from the voice and perspective of a 5 year old is quite unique.  Such emotional ride with heartbreaking to heartwarming moments made me feel like I was there in the Room with them. Would love to see this as a movie.

0307456625|4.0|We've said it at least 2 times before and we'll probably say it again.  For now however, we'll be content saying it in the present: we award high points to novels with completely unique narratives.  The setting for this novel takes place in Botswana and the proceedings that follow are all related to southern Africa living.  The agency's staff is unique, the clients are unique, and the cases are unique.  Heck, even the cover art is unique.      The woman who actually starts the detective agency, Mma Ramotswe, has a vibrant personality that resonates with the reader (this could be you).   The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is anxious to take on any case, which often leads to some very interesting events.  The cases range from not so simple mistaken identity; to work place dismemberment.  Still, Mma Ramotswe's practical problem solving skills are fully put to the test when she is asked to locate a missing eleven year old boy.  Step aside Holmes and Spade, there's a new sheriff in town!    Throughout The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, the reader is given a delightful glimpse into the culture and traditions of Botswana.  Still, it is the characters that make this novel special.  Mma Ramotswe is larger than life in every sense of the word.  And then there's Mr. Matekoni, who is easily the most likeable automobile mechanic in all of literature.  As to whether or not you'll enjoy this one; there is no mystery!

1897093616|5.0|Imagine yourself on the deck of a massive pirate ship staring across a table at Long John Silver.  That delicious, golden tan, breaded, slightly questionable piece of seafood eyeing you into submission.  Calling your name, \\"eat me I'm...\\"  Wait, hold on a second, we're being handed a sheet of paper...  Well, this is one of our more embarrassing intros.  Did anyone else know that Long John Silver was actually a Pirate?     Sorry for that, actually, Treasure Island is the inspiration for a whole lot more than just a chain of fast food restaurants.  Many modern day pirate stereotypes are taken from this novel - one legged pirates, parrot shoulder companions, and treasure maps marked with a fat big \\"X\\".  The story itself follows young Jim Hawkins and his adventure as cabin boy aboard a ship in search of buried treasure.  Thanks to a wooden barrel of apples, Jim finds himself in the very center of the melee, which includes, but is not limited to; mutiny, drunkenness, marooning, and a little known sea cook named, Long John Silver.      Treasure Island is wildly popular and has birthed countless prequels and sequels.  We enjoyed the novel immensely if for no other reason than to satisfy our endless need to understand pirate lour.  We were also very interested to read about the only man Captain Hook ever feared, as it is claimed within the pages of Peter Pan.  Don't be afraid to unearth this literary treasure yourself...
0446563048|1.0|After reading several articles on Zappos I had high hopes for 'Delivering Happiness,' and assumed that the 200+ pages would provide meaningful insights into the type of practices and organizational design strategies which have led to the creation of a unique and successful firm culture. Instead, I got a formulaic, and over all incredibly poorly written, book which if anything completely failed to deliver anything of value or meaning. For the most part the book's sub-chapters (each roughly 6 pages) stayed true to the same formula - present the problem, highlight the sacrifices tough decisions made by the author, and then celebrate the inevitable success which was only possible due to him. In-between there are even shorter 'guest appearances' by various Zappos employees to further praise the author. While I wasn't expecting the book to be deeply intellectual, I also failed to anticipate the author's ADD approach to writing. It was as if no detail of his life was too small to discuss (I especially loved the section on him throwing his own birthday party), but there was no turning point in his business experience, or lesson learned which was worth dedicating more than a page to.<br /><br />Zappos is an incredibly exciting company to watch, and one that has truly built a reputation via its business practices. This book is a cheap attempt to cash out on that work. Save the $15 and go ahead and buy yourself a pair of flip flops instead. You'll be much better off.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|What happens when you are an ex-CIA agent? With all the knowledge of worl government secrets is it all about haning up your gear and moving on to a happy retirement? Apparently not in the film RED. Bruce Willis playes a retired agent who is suddenly a target for termination by the very people who employed him and they will stop at nothing to see him dead. Even if that means getting your butt kicked many times over by the guy you are instructed to kill.<br /><br />RED is an entertaining hysterical ride. The cast is awesome, getting some of the most well known drama/action stars of the past 25-30 years to fill the roles of government assigned assasins in their golden years is nothing short of brilliant. Morgan Freemen delivers priceless one liners, John Malkovich is flat out hysterical and Helen Mirren....well all I can say is holy bejezus! Of course I have to say the rest of the cast was great. Karl Urban is really showing us that he is a great actor post LOTR. He does exceptionally well in these comic book adaption films and now it has been announced he will be playing Judge Dredd in the much needed re-dux. Brian Cox and Mary-Louise Parker also did a great job, though I didn't expect anything less. Probably the biggest surprise was Richard Dryfus...just because I haven't seen him in a movie in like FOREVER!<br /><br />All and all, RED is a fun film based on a comic book. I have it on DVD and it is definitely one of the few I will enjoy watching many times over.
B002ZG99N6|3.0|THE GOOD    - The shooting and car-chasing scenes are suspenseful and engaging.    - The hot-headed character played by Jeremy Renner delivered some sudden suspense. For example, in the scene where he first met Rebecca sitting with Ben on the side-walk café. It's very convincing.    THE BAD    - I can see no love chemistry between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall. Yes, they said they loved each other but I did not feel it.    - There was one big logical hole: The FBI agent was so easily outwitted by Ben with a simple trick.     In short, it's definitely worth watching. I watched it in the theatre.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|We all know of Facebook and the staple it has become in our culture, but how did it become what it is today? 'The Social Network' is the story of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg and shows us how he went from average Harvard student to the youngest billionare in the world today. Now, first and formost this story is not entirely factual. The film, which David Fincher brilliantly directs is based on a novel that is also not entirley based on 100% fact. However, when it comes to seeing a movie esepcially a movie about actual events as long as it is done well by the cast and crew it doesn't have to be 100% acurate (At least for me)<br /><br />'The Social Network gets every thing right when it comes to making an excellent film. The acting is supurb some performances are better than others as always. The script is great, Aaron Sorkin gives us a brilliant screen play and his fast switching diologue is perfect for a movie like this one because people who have such extrem brain power tend to talk like that to themselves and others. The sountrack drives this movie. As a huge fan of Trent Reznor it is amazing to see him break away from the industrial/pop music scene and put his haunting sound into film soundtrack. Of course David Fincher as I mentioned did a fantastic job brining us this film it is fast paced entertaining and all around awesome. The Social Network was one of the five films that I chose to be the best in 2010 and now it is nominated for best picture. So win or not it was well done and I highly recommend it.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|It is a great show and I'm happy with my purchase. It got here fast and safe just as described. I recommend this product.
030746363X|5.0|I found this to be extremely well written, well paced and rather than picking the 150 pages most applicable to what I wanted to do, I read it cover to cover.  And I don't read cover to cover.
0545123283|3.0|I really enjoyed \\"Shiver,\\" the first book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series.  As inundated as the book market is with new authors capitalizing on the success of \\"Twilight\\" by releasing a slew of sub-par books in the YA paranormal romance genre, it's hard not to be skeptical of a new series about werewolves.  I was surprised by how well I enjoyed the premise of the Mercy Falls wolves, and the love story between Grace and Sam was beautiful.  I couldn't wait to read \\"Linger,\\" but it was a bit disappointing.  Actually, it disappointed quite a lot.<br /><br />First of all, it is a bit difficult to adjust to the format.  The narration shifts (no pun intended) between Grace, Sam, Cole (introduced briefly in \\"Linger\\"), and Isabel.  This was not a horrible idea, and it does work to some degree.  However, some of the chapters or sections are so short that it's hard to remember who's talking.  If it only happened once or twice, it wouldn't be a big deal, but it happens frequently enough to make it a bit frustrating.<br /><br />Secondly, there wasn't enough going on.  In other reviews, I've commented about \\"middle book syndrome,\\" and this is a prime example.  There's not really enough going on to make it a complete book.  It's just a bridge between the first book and the last.  There's absolutely nothing in it that stands out as memorable.  In the grand scheme of this series, \\"Linger\\" will only be remembered as book 2...without any major plot development.  There was only one really major change, and it happened at the end.  (She had to write something to make you want to read \\"Forever.\\")<br /><br />The characters do go through some major changes in this book, which is worth mentioning.  Isabel is more likeable.  While remaining true to her attitude early in the series, she shows a bit more depth and emotion in \\"Linger.\\"  Cole becomes a major character, and the developing relationship between him and Isabel becomes much more interesting than that of Grace & Sam.  Their relationship is as unique as the two characters themselves, and it is their story which redeems this book.  Without Cole, the book would be unbearably dull.<br /><br />Speaking of Grace and Sam, they had such a beautiful story in \\"Shiver\\" that I really hated to ruin it with a sequel.  I loved the ending of \\"Shiver,\\" and wanted their possibilities to remain open.  Unfortunately, things are completely different in \\"Linger.\\"  There were whole pages I skimmed, because it went on and on about Sam missing Grace, or Grace missing Sam, or Grace hating her parents.  We get it.  Sam loves Grace, Grace loves Sam, and they both hate her parents.  Enough said; we really don't need page upon page of internal dialogue to illustrate this point.  Please don't fill another book with endless dialogue without the action and suspense to drive the plot forward.<br /><br />If you've read this far, you're probably wondering why I gave it 3 stars at all.  Well, quite honestly, a large part was due to Cole's character.  Seriously, he is a fantastic character.  He's selfish, arrogant, and does not possess one redeeming quality. Reading about him is fantastic, because he's uniquely unexpected. Sam and Grace are dealing with some majorly depressing issues, and the somber, brooding mood just lingers throughout the entire book.  (Thus, the title of this review.  Too many things linger without being fully developed and moving on.  It's very frustrating.)  However, Isabel and Cole and their dysfunctional backgrounds actually provide a breath of fresh air.  Although they are not any better off than Sam and Grace, they are characters of action, and they actually try to do something instead of just writing song lyrics or folding paper into cranes.<br /><br />If you loved \\"Shiver,\\" you'll want to read \\"Linger.\\"  The last few pages will make it necessary to understand what's going to happen in \\"Forever,\\" I'm sure.  Just plan to do a lot of skimming and have a carton of ice cream nearby.  It doesn't leave you feeling satisfied, and you'll likely be a tad depressed.  Let's hope \\"Forever\\" gives us a conclusion worth remembering for these characters!epressed.  Let's hope \\"Forever\\" gives us a conclusion worth remembering for these characters!
1439170045|5.0|I love that this is one on many books published today about scientific/medical topics written in narrative form, making important issues more accesible to the lay person.      Indeed the writing is not the best I've ever read, and I wish the characters were developed a bit more. But I have to give the book five stars for the author writing this story from the perspective of the Alzheimer's patient.  It made the book much more poignant.      I would like to recommend this book also to those out there who DO NOT know someone with Alzheimer's or dementia.  My mother had recently (in the last year) been diagnosed with dementia and passed away just a few weeks ago from complications of a fall.  I was in the process of reading this book and finished it after her death.  Had I known just a little bit of what was going on in her mind, as we see with Alice, I feel I could have comforted her more and understood how to increase the joy in her life. While I read all the dry, medical information about dementia, this book drove home points that I never read about.          And one more compliment to the author:  Bravo for self publishing and also for making the professional critics wrong when they saw little virtue in the book.  Obviously, the reading public thought differently.
0385341679|5.0|I love the book. I like the way she brought in so many characters from both series (Highlander series). It makes me anxious to see how she will weave them into additional stories creating an expanding tapestry of fantasy. The twists and turns about each character's nature kept my mind busy trying to figure out what would happen next. Every time I was sure I could see how it would all come together she threw a twist. This would force me to think back and realize I had missed clues which I can see clearly in hindsight. The story appeals to my different levels of intellect. The action and twists alone relates to my excitement and adventurous side. Bringing in deeper thinking aspects of Janus Head, good and evil based on point of view, journey to learning ones true nature, and ability to turn negative into positive interests me on a different level. I am a married man and my wife has also read the Fever series. With these stories I have gained interesting insight into her thoughts. Like most men, I can relate to many of Barron's character traits - even if it's with envy. My wife wants to be strong and adaptive like Mac. It validates my understanding of her desires for a relationship based on faithfulness during our journey and acceptance of what we really are - similar to Mac and Barron's relationship. I am glad this book brought momentary closure to so many aspects of the characters I have learned to like as well as the ones I disliked (and ones I thought I liked). Even more I like knowing they still have a future full of adventures and self-realization. I look forward to when Karen reveals the next section of her tapestry.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At 62, I'm hardly YA any more...This book captured my interest from the beginning and left me running for the second volume at the end.  Well written, suspenseful, creative.  The main character is a resourceful sixteen year old girl who volunteers for a battle to the death against 23 other teens.  Her day to day life is a struggle to save herself and her family from starvation.  Suzanne Collins has written a series of books here that will engage readers of all ages.
0439023513|5.0|I've read a lot of young adult novels. Almost all of them tie everything up with a  nice little bow. Everything and everyone ends up happy. There's not conflict. The only people who die are those that are barely introduced, but that's not how it is with this book.     This series was never about Katniss & Gale & Peeta-  it was always about war and revolution. Characters dies. People are pushed to their breaking point. They break down and get addicted to pills because of what they've seen. That's what going through hell does to people.     It's a good change from the teen romance books that plague the young adult books. This book aims higher and challenges the reader to actually think about the world they live in.

0143118420|1.0|At only page 87 I'm trying to force myself to finish but I'm so tired of all the whining from a self absorbed, over-privileged, neurotic Type A that she's stressing me out! I can't tolerate these types in real life so I'm left asking myself if I want to invest the time to read a book about one. \\"Oh, I'm SOOO miserable! Boo-hoo! I have everything I've ever wanted and I'm sobbing in a fetal position on the bathroom floor every night with a knife to my arm.\\"     I certainly think the depression diagnosis was incomplete and would also add borderline personality disorder. Self absorbed cry-baby isn't a real diagnosis but it should be.     I certainly hope Gilbert is over herself already and I am SOO disappointed a movie was made from this book. I've read a billion other books more movie worthy than this giant snot-rag.
B004E547D8|5.0|How on earth do these ex-CIA agents fit into normal life ? Their idea of friendship,family life, dating and other every activities are out of sync amidst this unnecessary business of getting old. To make matters bad the side they have been on is trying to get them or is someone else putting them up to it ? One thing for sure they couldn't have picked a better cast to play these characters. A very fun film to see.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I got this video for Christmas and I love it. This must be one of the more challenging videos I've ever had.  There are 3 levels each about 20 minutes long.  I am in good shape and thought I could start with level 2 or 3...but since Jillian said to start with level 1 i did.  Boy was I surprised.  Level one kicked my butt.  I have finally progressed to level 3 and now I just alternate through them depending on how I feel(some times doing two levels back to back).  Jillian offers alternative moves which are easier if you need them, therefore you can work at your own pace.  I have 3 Jillian Micheals videos and this one is my favorite.  Mainly because the time (I can fit in a 20 workout after work) and the intensity.

B000065M09|3.0|I am a fan of Guns N roses, and i had all of their cds mostly except this one. i got it for the main song on it, called patience. i use to love the song and the video was really cool i thought.  i found some new favorites like the cover of areosmiths ''mama kin''  it was my first time to hear the song after many people told me about it and i had read about GNR covering the song as well.  they do a good cover of the song.  The cd is mostly Live stuff of them in the early stages of the career they were having. the other song, the so called racist ''one of a million'' which got many peoplr uptight with its lyrics.  i found it to be interesting, and it gave me insight into the band and the lead singer of axl rose.  i always liked the early music of the band. its got the whole 80's style to it and they rock out live. and they seem to really enjoy the music and the crowd that goes crazy some times at GNR concerts.  its good if you wanna get into GNR early stuff you should start with this album. its only 8 songs but its a good listen.
B0041T4ML4|4.0|This is the first novel I've read by Bacigalupi, and I have to say that I am very impressed.  There are several minor problems - the windups themselves contain a major deux ex machina that is forgivable only because it does not alter the plotline too greatly, and the plot itself becomes fairly obfuscated by the end of the novel.  Also, the main romantic relationship in the novel has no real explanation at all, and almost seems to be for the sake of titillation rather than character development.    Despite these things, this is one heck of a read.  The author's \\"White Shirts\\" and \\"Yellow Cards\\" mimic historical groups of fanatics/refugees respectively, and are given an astoundingly solid portrayal not only as plot devices, but real characters.  The setting itself is entirely original, and is based off of two short stories by the same author (published in his anthology Pump Six, which is also available on Amazon).  The characterization is, with few exceptions, fantastic.  There is real subtlety, real conviction, and real humanity involved in these fictional people, and some of them seem to almost jump off the page.  The action/war scenes are beautifully done, showcasing the author's gift for portraying the organic sea-changes and utter chaos that can happen during a period of transition.    Despite the few flaws, I recommend this novel without hesitation to anybody who enjoys science fiction.  It's a crazy mixture of post-apocalyptic predictions, steampunk oddness, political scheming, and flat-out action, and it works.

This information eliminates confusion and varying opinions with actual Truth.  Read it.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|If you prefer the feel of an Xbox 360 controller to the PS3 controllers, this controller satisfies in that regard. However, the signal strength is horrible. My couch is probably around 8 ft away from my PS3 and if I don't sit with the controller flat in my hands, pointed directly at my PS3 it loses the signal. If anything is sitting on my coffee table, it loses the signal. If anyone walks in front of me for a brief second, it loses the signal. So the controller needs a direct, continuous, uninterrupted line of sight to the dongle plugged into the front of my PS3. You can also not turn on the PS3 with this controller, AND the controller ALWAYS defaults to being controller 1 for the system, even if you turn the system on with a wireless PS3 controller. I would have been willing to pay a bit more for this controller if it had utilized Bluetooth instead of the crappy dongle, but as far as this controller goes I regret this purchase and wish I had bought a second one of the default, wireless PS3 controllers instead.
B000BT97AO|4.0|this movie is strange i thought the movie was okay but ididn't really like the way they did the animation. I mean it was okay and all but not my type. I gave it four stars because the acting in it was good and thats all.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|3D in home video is an amazing development, and this movie, filmed in 3D, delivers a great viewing experience. In my opinion, the first and fourth episodes, both directed by Paul Anderson are notably better than the other two in terms of story, camerawork, and particularly as regards the soundtracks, and sound in suspenseful movies is after all what creates the atmosphere. I hope he directs the fifth, and I hope it's done in 3D.
B002ZG999U|5.0|this is one of the best action movies i've seen in a long time. you know how they say that this movie has every action star in it will it is missing two people jackie chan chow yun fat. if those two were in it than it would of been the ultimate action movie. oh i forgot vin diesle and the rock. oh well it was still a great action movie. mabye if they do a sequell they will put them in it. But i will say this one thing who better but sylvester Stallone to direct the movie. great movie all should see this film

B003UYUP58|5.0|\\"Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings whom they know nothing\\" --Voltaire<br /><br />The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, is a fascinating book about the history of cancer, a disease that would kill 600,000 people in the United States, and 7 million people worldwide in 2010 alone.  The author, an Oncologist, researcher, and professor of medicine began this book when he was a resident at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and an Oncologist at Mass General Hospital in 2005.<br /><br />Most of the information learned about cancer in this novel takes is from the early 1900's to the present, however, in 440bc, a Greek Historian named Herodotus recorded the story of Atossa, Queen of Persia, who has a \\"bleeding lump in her breast. Her breast was removed, however, it is uncertain as to whether the cancer had returned when she died.  There is also on record a 1,000 year old bone cancer preserved in a mummy that was a member of the Chiribaya Tribe. So it appears that cancer was present in the distant past, but that it was somewhat rare, probably because as the author writes. \\"people didn't live long enough to get cancer\\". Today since people are living longer and longer, it makes sense that more of us will die of this disease unless a cure is found, as \\"mutations in cancer genes increase with age\\".<br /><br />Today however, although significant advances have been made, the war on cancer has not been won by any means. The book is loaded with interesting information, but a difficult book to review, so I thought I would share a combination of statistics, advances in treatment and quotes, that I found interesting:<br /><br />  \\"Killing a cancer cell in a test tube is easy. The trouble lies in finding a selective poison - a drug that will kill cancer without annihilating the patient\\"<br /><br />  * Between 1970-1994, lung cancer was the #1 killer. Lung cancer with women over age 55 increased by 400%.<br />  * Between 1990-2005, mortality declined by about 1% each year for, lung, breast, colon and prostate cancer --despite this, a half million Americans died of cancer in 2005 alone.<br />  * 1/400 - 39 year old women will develop breast cancer<br />  * 1/9 - 70  year old women will develop breast cancer<br />  * As of 1981, radical mastectomy is rarely performed today<br />  * Prostate cancer and breast cancer are hormone dependent cancers<br />  * Breast cancer and ovarian cancer have been found to be connected<br /><br />In 1962, the drug Tamoxifen was developed for birth control, but was found to have the reverse effects, actually shutting off the estrogen signal to tissues. In 1973, V. Craig Jordan, a bio-chemist from a little known lab in Central Massachusetts found estrogen receptors were highly responsive to Tamoxifen which choke the cells growth, so a trial drug program was designed for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer, which seemed to cut the cancer's recurrence by 50% in women over 50. It lengthened survival, however, many patients eventually relapsed.<br /><br />The book is full of fascinating insights of the discoveries, advances and outcomes made by cutting edge scientists of the past and present, like the discovery of radium oncology in the early 1900s, mammography, PAP tests, and so much more. From the primitive surgeries of the past to the politics of battling insurance companies who deny treatments here today, this book is never dry or dull. The book is like a medical drama of the past and present. There are interesting photos, advertisements and articles as well. The book was easy to read and understand, even if you are someone who does not have a background in science. Don't let the 590+ pages discourage you from reading this wonderful book, as at least 20% of that are sources used for researching this book.

B0037Z95Z6|1.0|After enjoying the first Cranford so much, I was very excited to have another opportunity to visit with the ladies.  Imagine my disappointment when I received the blu-ray disc only to find out it cannot be viewed on standard U.S. blu-ray players because it's an import.  This disc is more expensive than others (approx. $52) and since it's been opened, it cannot be returned.  Will I buy it if it ever comes out in a U.S. format, probably, but I'm very disappointed that neither the disc nor Amazon.com made it clear that it would not play in the U.S. unless I had special equipment.  Before purchasing this disc, be very sure you have the proper equipment to view it.
B0046UGSNS|4.0|I saw this in the theater and enjoyed it very much. I rented it on DVD and it was a weaker film. That sometimes happens.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Wow, it's funny how there is pretty much only one bad review for this movie. It's a great movie. Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter, as well as the speech therapist and others deliver outstanding performances. The audience pretty much is torn apart upon listening to the King and his attempts to cure himself of his speech impediment. It's a solid movie. Even if you dislike slow movies, consider giving the film a chance as a rental. The film holds your attention from start to finish. The production is pretty superb as well as the music.

B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Well this is one of those rare instances where the plethora of mediocre reviews littering the internet were invaluable at lowering my expectations going in.  To be honest, I liked this one far, far more than I expected to based on popular consensus alone.  I think the reason for this is due in part to the simple fact that I've done the old fable turned modern CG film many, many times in the past and can attest to how horribly wrong it can all go (try any of the Unstable Fables, Happily N'ever Afters and so on).<br /><br />What we have here is a cutesy CG piece that by no means pushes the animation envelope (even for 2005 standards) that works off the tried and true formula of decent narrative rather than retina-popping visual appeal.<br /><br /> Zach Braff voices the title character; the resourceful little chicken of popular myth who sends the town into a panic when he rings the bell in the school tower while announcing that the sky is falling. Unable to find the piece of the sky that he saw fall, his father Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) is naturally humiliated and tells his son to lay low for a while. Chicken Little abides by his father's wishes, and, in effort to follow in his father's footsteps, even joins the baseball team at school.  Unfortunately just as it seems that things are okay between the father and son's strained relationship, another piece of the sky happens to fall (directly onto Chicken's head no less). The poor diminutive fowl is reluctant to even attempt to explain it a second time considering he hadn't even lived down his first lapse in judgment.<br /><br />Chicken Little in the company of his best friends Abby Mallard (Ugly Duckling (Joan Cusack))) and Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), discover that sections of falling sky are in fact panels from a UFO being piloted by alien beings with a plan of total global domination.<br /><br />Naturally he is unable to get anyone to believe him after his earlier humiliation but impending invasion waits not for the reconciliation of the boy who cried wolf, oh wait wrong fairy tale!<br /><br />Like The Wild, Valiant, and Bolt, Chicken Little represents that period where Disney and Pixar's relationship was quite strained and \\"the Diz\\" was doing all they could to prove to the public (and to themselves) that they could pull off a computer-generated masterpiece without the help of Pixar.<br /><br />Did they succeed with Chicken Little? Actually the answer to that one is a surprising yes.  Not that this one raises the bar by any means; it can just as easily be viewed as committing no major gaffes either.  What's here is a charming little piece that actually (and rarely) takes a fairy tale base and turns it into a modern-day adventure with a fitting homage to films like War of the Worlds.<br /><br />Additionally impressive here is the humor, which actually relies upon well developed characters and solid scripting over visual gags or (ahem DreamWorks) sexual innuendos.  In fact the film, like most Disney animated pieces, earns the G-rating and manages to pack some pretty intense sequences into the generally restrictive criteria.  The world consists entirely of personified animals and casting Don Knotts as the jittery turkey mayor, Wallace Shawn as the canine school principle and the duo of Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara as the alien couple proves that Disney's knack for selecting appropriate vocal talent was never in jeopardy.<br /><br /> Rather than take itself too seriously, Chicken Little keeps things light by integrating an incredibly rich in-film soundtrack that bounces all over the spectrum: everything from a catchy ditty written specifically for the film by the Bare Naked Ladies to the requisite It's the End of the World as We Know It (REM) during the alien invasion sequence.  Other gems include an impromptu karaoke session to the Spice Girls' If you Wanna Be My Lover and the Bee Gees Stayin' Alive as character motivation (heck even the credit roll begins with a prettyfunny rendition of Elton John's Don't go Breaking My Heart).<br /><br />Living legend Hans Zimmer is responsible for the film's scoring so soaring highs, creepy lows and perfectly appropriate mood settings are a given.<br /><br />In all the gags work with varying degrees of success: Runt of the Litter being a big Barbra Streisand fan will likely be lost on the vast majority of the intended audience but the Indiana Jones segment, for example, is fantastic stuff.<br /><br />While the general opinion seems to label Chicken Little as a failure (or at the very least a failure in living up to its expectations), I tend to consider this, the first fully computer generated feature film produced in-house by Disney, a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end with just enough charm to appeal to viewers of all ages.Living legend Hans Zimmer is responsible for the film's scoring so soaring highs, creepy lows and perfectly appropriate mood settings are a given.

The action is pretty intense and the adpatation from graphic novels and  Batman lore are excellent.  The animation is very smooth and I like how they change up the animation from feature to feature.  For those who don't reguarily watch these features this is an excellent one to start with, it won't disappoint.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I saw the original movie the\\"Mechanic\\" back in the 1970's. This movie starred Charles Bronson as Arthur Bishop the  hit man and Jan Michael Vincent as his understudy. The new movie has Jason Strathem in the role of the professional killer Arthur Bishop. Ben Foster plays the role of Steve McKenna Bishop's killer in training. Bishop kills a Columbian drug lord. He then recieves an assignment to kill McKenna(Donald Sutherland. This was his acrual mentor.   Bishop carries out a few more assignments when he is approached by McKenna's son Steve to teach him the art of being a contrsct killer. Sreve helps in carrying out some of the assassinations. He does one solo and nearly gets killed himself. Bishop's employers do not like a new player in the field. They finally send out contract hit teams to get Bishop. Bishop turns the tables and kills his former bosses. Steve McKenna blows Bishop's truck up trying  to gain vengance. There is a shocking ending that will dazzle you. See this movie. This one is as good as the original.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This movie will do for Darren Aronofsky what Memento did for Chris Nolan! Seriously look I'm a heterosexual male, and when I heard about this movie I was like \\"ewww a movie about swan lake!\\" and swore that I'd never see this movie, and then I heard about the lesbian scene with Godess Natalie (Nina Sayers), and Godess Mila (Lily) and I said \\"Hey I might have to see this movie now!\\" so I said what the heck I can watch a movie about swan lake aslong as I see some some girl on girl action, and well while the scenes we're done pretty well it wasn't as raunchy as advertised but other then them scenes I ended up falling in love with this movie for it's sick twisted storyline, and it's amazing directing, and acting by the entire cast really makes for nothing short of a masterpiece!<br /><br />Natalie Portman is sure to win best actress for this role I mean she was amazing in her role as Nina the young lady chosen to be the Swan princess. An honor which from the way it's made to look in the movie is a big big deal in that world.<br /><br />I refuse to spoil anything else of the movie so all I will say is head out to this one because it's worth watching, and I can't wait until this movie is on blu ray so I could watch it in all it's glory on 1080p!<br /><br />I heard talk of Darren Aronofsky possibly taking over for Nolan in the Batman series, and this movie makes me feel like that could end up working out really well. He understands how to make movies which deal with human psychology, and that is something Nolan also understands, and both his Batman movies have been very psychologically driven pictures.<br /><br />Anyway everyone check out Black Swan believe it's an amazing movie.<br /><br />- Tha JackaL<br />[...]

B000YDAYW2|4.0|These are super comfortable boots. I saw them first inside a Gap store on a mannequin and asked for details. I first got them for Christmas as a gift but had to return them for a different size. Next size was still to big, and had to return them once again. I ended up getting them 1.5 sizes smaller than what I normally wear. I plan to spray them w/ scotchguard for extra weather protection. The ankles feel a little uncomfortable but I think it's because they are new and not fully broken in yet. I also noticed that they don't grip well on wet surfaces, but that might be because they are brand new.
B00000G3I2|2.0|I'd never watched this film until now; when it came out in 1983, I read the reviews and gave it a pass. I'm a Michigan alumnus who was in Ann Arbor during the years when these characters supposedly were. Let me be pleasantly firm about this:  Many of us never lost our youthful ideals or had to compromise our dreams of living lives devoted to peace, to social justice, to an egalitarian society.  None of my friends were, or are in our maturity, anything like Kasdan's characters. It's my strong feeling that his film depicts Michigan graduates unrealistically and demeans the glorious liberal education we were given in Ann Arbor.<br /><br />  Here are a few facts for those who might differ.  First off, a small but telling point of error: \\"Tell Him,\\" by the Exciters, came out in 1962, a time when the film's characters were probably in the early years of high school.  Secondly, for Michigan women students of the mid-to-late 60s era, majoring in pre-law or pre-med was still quite rare. The influx of women into those professions didn't begin until years later. Third point:  At the time the film was released, my husband and I were living in academia with our four small children. Our friends from Ann Arbor days were at similar points in their lives.  We did not rue the idealism of our youth.  We lived it out.  We still do.<br /><br />  Back then, we felt we could make a difference, and we have.  Kasdan picked the wrong university for the shared past of his angst-ridden group, although I'm unable to point out any comparable school which might do.
B0000029GA|5.0|If I could only pick one album to listen to for the rest of my life, this is it.  This album is a classic and these tracks don't get old for me no matter how many times I listen to them.    Halftime and One Time 4 Your Mind are probably my favorite tracks but all of them are great.  I would recommend this album to anyone.  Even if you're not a fan of hip-hop, this is the album to start your collection.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|It was a long wait for a new Gregg Allman albumn, but maybe it was worth it.  T Bone Burnett and Allman put together a great album.  I'm not sure why Rolling Stone didn't rate it any higher than it did because i think this could certainly be listed in the top 3 of Allman's career.  Any Allman fan and any Blues fan would really enjoy listening to this...(over and over).
B00005K3O4|4.0|I don't now why but this movie is just hard to take you eyes off of...The \\"klowns\\" are ridiculous, the setting is over the top with a big top as a space ship, and the cotton candy part of this movie adds just enough spice that this is one of the more enjoyable flicks Ive watched in a last few months. Don't watch this with a serious eye..just sit back with a huge bowl of popcorn, a few dozens beers or friends and pop the top on this kooky, hilarious, faced paced sci-fi comedy. If nothing else tune in to this one just to watch the weird looking aliens!!!!
B000002TQV|4.0|Radiohead has always one of those bands that I want to \\"get\\" but don't quite. This is the best I've heard from them yet. The music has a nice atmospheric sound and most of the songs are fairly accessible. However, I find myself bored by the end of the album each time I listen to it in full. Like most Radiohead album, it lacks hooks in many of its songs. Overall, though, this album is well put-together and while it didn't convert me to a Radiohead fan, I did enjoy it.

B000BTJDGC|4.0|After recently reviewing [[ASIN:B003L20IF6 The Last Exorcism]], I noticed that many of the other reviewers of the movie were suggesting that it was not as scary or effective as 2005's The Exorcism of Emily Rose. I had never seen Emily Rose so I gave it a try this past weekend (and the price sure was right for a used copy here on Amazon!). It turned out that those other reviewers that I referred to were correct; Emily Rose is a well done, well acted, thought provoking and scary movie told in a sequence of flashbacks from two points of view: those who believe it was demonic possession and those who would discredit and even prosecute the priest responsible for Emily's exorcism and ultimate death.<br /><br />Jennifer Carpenter ([[ASIN:B003N0QEJA Dexter]]) is Emily and while she never goes completely [[ASIN:B001992NW4 Regan]], she gets pretty close at times and does a heck of job creeping the viewer out. Yeah, in fact Director Scott Derrickson keeps viewers completely creeped out for the whole film.<br /><br />According to the opening of the movie, Emiliy Rose is \\"based on a true story\\".  Derrickson uses some clever deception tactics to make you think that the characters and events in Emily Rose actually happened, but in reality the movie is mostly Hollywood imagination that is quite loosely based on the story of Anneliese Michel. (If you look up Anneliese Michel on Wikipedia you'll find a brief description of her events and a link to a 90 minute tape if Anneliese's actual exorcism...which I wouldn't have the guts to play if you paid me!)<br /><br />I'd highly recommend checking out Emily Rose if, like me for whatever reason, you missed it back in 2005.
B003EYVXTG|1.0|I thought I'd like this movie given the critical acclaim it has received.  I was wrong.  The story is so slim, the pacing is excruciatingly slow, some of the scenes do not seem to advance anything.  I wonder if some of the acclaim is due to a fascination with how poor folks in the Ozarks live, killing squirrels for food, etc.  To call this a \\"thriller\\" could not be farther from the truth!
B00000DQSS|5.0|arrived in great condition, no issues. Kate 'matures' some on this one,,,maybe even starts to get wierder but her voice is less tinny.
0385341679|5.0|I was actually hesitant to pick up this book, though it had been staring at me since the moment it came out. How would KMM wrap up such an astounding series in a way that worked for me?<br /><br />She did. Not a question - it was amazing.<br /><br />All the favorites are back (even with a little crossover moment with our favorite Highlander!), and there is never a slow moment in this book. The emotional trials that Mac goes through are incredible, and you may think you know what the truth is, but I wouldn't be so sure!<br /><br />I absolutely cannot wait for the spin-off series that KMM has rumored.<br /><br />Do NOT read this book if you haven't read the first four. But do go read the first four - they're definitely worth it. This is a series to be read over and over again.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Kept you on edge throughout the whole movie.  Must pay really close attention because the ending will keep you guessing.  All in all, loved it!!
1439107955|3.0|This is a wonderful book and I learned a lot. But why does the American Medical Machine still ignore the possibility of natural cures? I am sick of doctors refusing to accept alternative medicines into the game. What is so wrong with adding a vitamin c drip during chemo? Is it because the insurance companies and pharmaceuticals won't make their obscene profits? We need all  the help we can get to fight this disease. It is the arrogance that infuriates me. Face it guys, there is more out there than surgery, chemo and radiation.
0060765488|1.0|The \\"see inside this book\\" is not accurate at all!  I was looking forward to all the beautiful colored pictures shown in the see inside this book for this purchase.  Instead, this is a black and white book w/some movie photos in the middle.  Not what is promised here!
B0042JH05I|3.0|Ever since Phil's first solo album it was clear that he had been heavily influenced by Motown and Soul music.  That and Phil's enormous stage presence were reasons why I was so excited to own this concert on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Perhaps I had my expectations too high.<br /><br />Phil's stage presence was not even close to his best and his performance was remarkably sub-par.<br /><br />The band backing him up were very talented but Phil's renditions of these classic Soul and Motown tunes did nothing to improve upon them.<br /><br />It was almost as though Phil never rehearsed the set, as though he phoned in his performance.  Ever see \\"Live Karaoke?\\"  It's just like Karaoke but with a live band backing you up instead of music tracks.  That's what this reminded me of.<br /><br />I am a HUGE music lover with a great appreciation for Genesis and Phil Collins but this purchase will sit on the shelf and gather dust after my initial purchase.<br /><br />I own over 150 Concert Videos and rate them honestly, even if I am fans of the artists.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i loved this book because it realy put a pix of what was happening in the book, in my head. the last fue pages where slow
0385341679|4.0|*CAUTION: minor spoilers present*<br /><br />So, I've been an ardent fan of this series since inception and I was more or less happy with the outcome of the book. I liked Mac's character development, I wish we could have seen more of jerico's feelings for her, the scenes with her parents were touching, the death of LM Darroc was anticlimatic and well coming down to the end, the whole bit w/ v'lane and the book was...i dunno...it just didn't work for me. I know the book cannot die and merely transforms but still.... it didnt ring my bell as it were- hence the 4 stars.<br /><br />overall, a great book though.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|Updating the Predator saga is a cool idea, as the alien has proved to be an iconic and enduring figure in science fiction, since Arnold first battled the creature in the original Predator (1987).  With Robert Rodriguez (Sin City) as a producer, Nimrod Antal (Vacancy) as director, and a budget around 40 million, the prospects for success appeared good.  Although the presentation in Predators (2010) is undeniably slick, and features some exciting state of the art action sequences, the story that connects the events is not very well constructed.  While failing to reach its full potential, the film still has enough good points to thrill and entertain.<br /><br />Predators begins boldly with a group of humans intended as Predator prey, plummeting down to an alien planet.  Royce (Adrien Brody), a mercenary, emerges as the leader.  The rest include soldiers Nikolai (Oleg Takrarov), Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali), and Isabelle (Alice Braga), Yakuza member Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien), Cuchillo (Danny Trejo) an enforcer for a drug cartel, and Stans (Walton Groggins) a serial killer.  The oddball is Edwin (Topher Grace), who is a physician.  (Spoilers follow)<br /><br />The film builds tension as the group reconnoiters the jungle, but the initial promise of the screenplay by Michael Finch and Alex Litvak, soon begins to fade, as the characters are a mixed bag ill-suited to working together as a fighting unit.  When under attack by the alien \\"dogs\\", the group panics, displaying an inability to target the creatures, and kill efficiently.  If this bunch can't handle the dogs, what chance do they have against their masters?<br /><br />It's still everyone for themselves when the humans find the Predator's camp, complete with bloody trophies, and a prisoner Predator, chained to a tree.  Another man is lost when the Predators strike, as panicking again, the scattered group all wind up rolling over a cliff and tumbling into a pool of water.  Amazingly there are no broken necks, but the prospects for survival remains quite dim.<br /><br />A ray of hope appears, when the group is surprised by Noland (Laurence Fishburne), a man who uses a captured Predator's suit to become invisible.  Noland plays a vital role in the film, because he provides crucial background information about what is happening, that ties events together.  Although the Predators supposedly use the hunts to refine their killing skills, it appears that they aren't terribly efficient.  An intelligent being with the ability to become invisible, would just sneak up and obliterate the enemy, not take a shot, then reveal itself and become a target, as they repeatedly do.  And wouldn't it be logical for the Predators to suspect that a huge empty ship might make an appealing hiding place for enemy prey?  The Predators are clearly not that bright, and the contest is perhaps closer to being even than it might first appear.<br /><br />The same logic regarding invisibility also applies to Noland, as while invisible he could gather information from the group, or even kill them, if that was really his intention.  Instead he reveals himself, takes the group to his secret hideout, and then while complaining to an invisible friend about how there isn't enough food, tries to suffocate the group fanning smoke from a fire.  It's all quite absurd, and for more idiocy, Royce sets off an incendiary round to draw the Predators, with the hope that the aliens will free them.<br /><br />His plan does work, thinning down the herd on both sides, and moving things closer to a showdown.  The film's big twist plays rather nicely, though it's a mystery why the Predators would consider collaborating with a human.  It finally comes down to the expected pairing of Royce and Isabelle, taking on the last remaining Predator.  Royce finally gets to flex his muscles, battling the Alien one on one, his body covered in mud, and even mimicking Arnold's original lines.  Teamwork prevails again, with an impressive coup de grace, and the story concludes with the door wide open for another sequel.<br /><br />Well done technically, Predators is a fun film, but a flawed script prevents it from being really special.  The story has some good ideas, but also many problems.  It might have worked better if the team were competent fighters, instead of amateurs repeatedly getting their butts kicked.  The acting is very good, although characters like Stans, Nicolai, and Hanzo, aren't given a chance to contribute much, and are along mainly to become redshirt fodder.  It would have been nice to see more of Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo, whose talents seem woefully underutilized.  Cold, distant, and snooty, Adrien Brody is Rodriguez's model for the modern action hero.  Broady's rather full of himself, and kind of a hard guy to like.<br /><br />Predators looks great on Blu-ray, not a lot of bright colors, but the sharpness of the jungle is very crisp.  There are some nice extra features, mostly related to production and special effects.  A commentary track featuring Rodriguez and Antal, has some good information, with Rodriguez often dominating the conversation.cludes with the door wide open for another sequel.

B00065MDRW|5.0|This is a good remaster.  Thankfully, Fripp didn't feel the need to add tracks that didn't make it, assuming they exist.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I was looking for something my grandaughter (age 5) would enjoy, that I would enjoy and that would give a real indication of what Hi Def TV should really look like. This product met all requirements.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|\\"Day in the Life\\" was the perfect ending to a great album.  Why add a little ditty at the end with the remaster?  Sure maybe vinyl was a little confining, but didn't it's limitations allow the artist to choose the best and discard the rest?  There should be an option on a CD or DVD to have access to extra tracks, but not part of the original.  Maybe a \\"hit play again to hear added tracks\\" option.
B000W9EOEC|4.0|I was surprised to find out that the cd had songs mixed together to make a new song. But all together the songs sound great. Daft Punk still rules. Just wish I would have known that before buying.
B00007LTIC|3.0|For big fans, the remaster may be of interest, but for others, stick to the original recording if you can.  But then again, you can always rip it and copy what you like.     The title track is great, but the remainder seems a bit aimless and lacks passion.  Good for a Yes fan, but if you are looking to just get a few Yes albums, stick to Fragile, Close to the Edge, and The Yes Album.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|If you are a huge fan of the Tudors, this is the box set to buy. It has many bonus features that any fan of the show will truly appreciate. I however encountered a problem with one of my discs. Season 2 Disc 2 has a problem where it will be choppy, it will start and stop and then start and stop again. Really irritating. I tried it in two different players too just to be sure. I haven't checked all my discs yet but that one seems to have a problem. Other than that this is a great set to buy and is a very entertaining show.
B000001F5F|4.0|Get the original recording if you can. I'm not sure you can find it on CD, so try an LP or cassette.  They had to edit out parts of \\"Electric Co.\\" in later editions and it's amazing what a difference a few seconds can make.  Bono's charisma, before the pink glasses and save the world pretensions, made them one of the best live acts, and this album almost captures it.
B002SQNM9A|4.0|Happy with the product itself, but not the packaging.   I was planning on gifting this to someone, but I'm not happy with the case.   It had a huge crack on the front, but whatever.   THe shipping was extremely fast!  Received item within 4 bus days!

B002WY65VU|4.0|Zombieland is perhaps one of the few movie's, aside from Shaun of the dead, that can honestly sum up how people would react to the dead rising to eat the living. While there are plenty of walking corpses about, the focus is on how the small group in the film deal with the reality of living with zombies in some fairly halirous ways.<br /><br />I think the best part of the film is the use of the \\"rules\\" that the main character makes up and narriates as the movie goes along, depicting what one would call common sence rules when dealing with zombies.<br /><br />This is a must watch for anyone who is tired of the horror craze of zombies in films and wants something to laugh at.
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures seems like the culmination of years of exploration, probably because later albums haven't come close.  It's too bad the \\"keyboard\\" wasn't as restrained on later albums, but here it adds rather than dominates.
B003L20ICE|2.0|Largely humourless \\"comedy\\" (and a not so good feeling \\"feel good movie\\") about a dysfunctional family, who.... remains dysfunctional.     The end.      spoilers abound:    Lessee.... Lesbian life partners, one a doctor, focused, businesslike, with a over-achieving biological daughter.  The other one showing evidence of drifting through life, trying various careers, never really sticking with one.  HER biological child is a slacker son who's drifting in unhealthy directions because of his seemingly passive choice of social outlets.      So, let's introduce the sperm donor into the mix, shake well, see what happens....    This movie didn't work for me, overall. There were a few bits that did, however.    Great acting by Mark Ruffalo and Mia Wasikowski.  Actually liked how Ruffalo's character was developed, and how he went from being a bit of a man whore, to really loving the family dynamic, perhaps more than he should.    Not much character development throughout.  Not a ton of plot development.      Slacker son realized that his one friend's an ass.   That's the sum of his growth.       The daughter's too shy to put moves on the boy she's always hanging out with.  Until she gets drunk at a party and kisses him a couple of times.  But then runs off, perhaps disgusted with herself, it's not made clear.  She... well at least she leaves for college.       The relationship between the two women does an occasionally-decent job of showing long standing hostilities that are kept under the surface, and what happens when they surface.   Fairly realistic for an old married couple.    Bening's character seems to have it all together, until the sperm donor starts being part of the life, then she flips out.  Julianne Moore's feeling a bit ignored, so immediately has sex with Ruffalo. Repeatedly.  Seemingly odd behaviour for someone who's not attracted to men.        End was very \\"bleh\\".     Only characters that really seemed to develop were Ruffalo's, and to a lesser extent the son.    To a much lesser extent.      Lots of stuff that might go somewhere, but really didn't.  I'm sure I didn't \\"get\\" it, but ended up feeling that daughter was lucky to leave, and son, who had just started to shape up a bit from where he was at the beginning of the movie, was in for a rough ride.      Not worth the time spent watching it, overall.   And I found the marketing strategy for the film to be blatantly dishonest.    Oh, and really, didn't need to see the manporn repeatedly on the TV.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I absolutely Love this movie!!! It was one of my favorite disney movies when I was a child. So, I purchased it for my two year old son (and for myself- to recap on my childhood memories). Not only does this movie depicts important life learning lessons, but it is a positive movie to be enjoyed by all ages! ... or maybe I'm just a big kid! LOL!     The Lion King is a classic Disney movie! Buy it!!!

0316098337|3.0|This book grabbed my attention as soon as I started reading it and I had to read through until the end. It was very interesting to me to imagine how a child could grow to believe reality was just what he had inside Room and how brave and smart Ma was. My only problem with this book was it reached its climax too soon and the rest of the book was down-hill. I kept expecting something else was going to happen and it never did. It was sad when it came to an end.
1595141715|5.0|'I just got through reading this book. 13 Reasons Why, by Jay Asher. I read a lot of books, and a good majority of them are Young Adult. Why? For one they are short, I dont like being married to a book unless its amazingly extraordinary, like Stephen Kings The Stand, or books 4-7 of Harry Potter. Most books that are thick and wordy seem to suffer from poor editing, and fluffed up plots that could have been a good novel if shorter.<br /><br />I also love Young Adult books because they are full of real human emotions, and sometimes believable situations. Many books geared towards my own age are full of soccer moms, or working girls who are trying to break the glass ceiling. Mostly crap I cannot relate too. I dont have any kids, and i never really grew up so it fits.<br /><br />13 Reasons Why HIT me like a ton of bricks inside a old pillowcase circa 1991. I might be in my 30's but I certainly can remember how much being a teen can sometimes suck, and be wonderful and hurt at the same time. This is the story of a girl, Hannah, who is dead. Suicide. And Clay Jenson who gets a boxful of cassette tapes with her voice on it, basically explaining to certain people why she killed herself. You must pass the tapes along or a third party will release the tapes and some people might have secrets out they didnt want known, and some might even see jail time.<br /><br />Clay has NO IDEA why he is on the tapes, but he listens anyway because they were sent to him for a reason right? I found the way Jay Asher splices her voice in italics and Clays thoughts and actions in regular type so easy to follow and understand and I could hear her voice....which was eery. Suicide is not painless, especially to the people left behind wanting an explanation and even when they hear why? they are still confused. I both related to her, and begged for more to go on. Isnt that always the case?<br /><br />Loved this book. Would recommend to both teen and adults.
0440243688|5.0|After the last couple of Reacher books, I'd gotten relatively disappointed with what seemed to be lazy writing.  Gone Tomorrow, though, was loads of fun and got me jazzed about the series again.  The attention to detail and clever situations were worthy of the character, and there was no self-involved mewling like in Bad Luck & Trouble (I still can't believe Reacher was whining \\"why me\\" in that book--so out of character).  In Nothing to Lose, I never understood why the antagonists just didn't kill him when they had the chance (repeatedly).    Here, though, it's clear Lee Child set up his plot well.  He does his research and knows the character's voice, and it's a great fun read.  Good to see him back in form.
B003FSTN6Q|4.0|This is a great series.  I didnt like the ending though.  It was kind of blah compaired to the rest of the episodes.  But I would definatly recomend this movie series.

B0042JTDXK|1.0|I was very disappointed with this album.  I am a big Josh Groban fan but not of this album.  I can't find one song I really like on it.  They are very folksy and the style is so different from his normal style that if this were his first album, I would never have become a fan.  I am sad that after waiting for his next album, this is it.  If you are new to Josh Groban, try his other albums first, they are much, much better!
1439152780|4.0|Just discovered this author and enjoyed THE DISTANT HOURS ---   A lovely book for a snowy winter day.
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|Just wanted to add my vote to bump this film up.     It's Denzel, it's Whittaker, but not a crazy action movie.  Not a mystery.  Although, it is a miraculous story based on real historical figures and events.  You might guess it's \\"just talk\\" but its much more than that.     And just in case you feel every movie needs some SEX, ACTION, VIOLENCE, BLOOD -- yes there's some of that too - but it's just part of the story not just thrown in.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Black Swan plays out as a feminine nightmare in which the lines between reality and the imagined become progressively warped and blurred, eventually snapping entirely. Many assuptions can be made about whether or not this film represents a female perspective of eternal pressures, or a male sexual fantasy about a frigid hard bodied ballerina desperately in need of some sexual awakening. The one thing that does not parallel male sexual fantasy, is Nina's lack of grip on reality. Craziness and drama are not sexy. I would also stress that this film does not tell you that all women are frail and neurotic, Nina certainly is, as is Beth , played by Winona Ryder, but then you have a character like Lily, played by Mila Kunis, who is shown as being quit confidently self assured. Black Swan is an individual story about an individual character that represents a particular nightmare, and is clearly not meant to represent the entire female species. Whether a film like this one makes you worry that some young girls might wrongfully identify with Nina and see her as a roll model, is not the point of this film, and should not be the focus of the films central themes. This film exists solely to give the viewer an emotional and visual psychological nightmare, that's Black Swan's amusement park ride, which it pulls off to a very decent extent. If anything, Black Swan is really just a kind of retelling of the Japanese Anime Perfect Blue, and is certainly not worthy of a crusade.     How funny is that Winona Ryder gets all upset when Nina steals from her?    Nina, who gets her big break from a NY dance company, is thrust into a roll that requires her to have split personalities. Though she is perfect for the roll of the virginal white swan, she just can't seem to embody the roll of the seductive black swan. Her push comes to shove when she meets her bold sexy polar opposite in Lily. Her already fragil mental state unravels entirely when she explores and awakens her own personal hidden dark side. The continual focus on Nina's anguished face is absolutely necessary and coincides perfectly with her claustrophobic apartment and overbearing mother. The contiual close-ups do become a bit taxing on the viewer. In fact, I started to hear my own mothers voice in my head warning me.  \\"If you keep making that face, it will freeze that way!\\"  I was worried that Nina's eyebrows might just permenantly nit together.    The sexuality in this film is something to be seen and admired, because it focuses so much more on female rather then male sensual pleasure. I was especially overjoyed to see Mila Kunis as Lily, dive on Natalie Portman's Nina. The very idea of how this moment back handed the violence loving sex hating MPAA right across the chops, had me grinning from ear to ear.    So put that in your pipe and smoke it!    The most powerful symbolic motif in this film was its use of mirrors. There are mirrors everywhere you look. These mirrors begin to quickly reflect Nina's self criticism and continually fracturing personality, while adding to the claustrophobia and paranioa closing in all around her. Even on the subway she can't escape these reflections which encompass her on all sides. This motif culminates in a rather sick moment in which a dirty old business man makes lewd obscene getsures at her on her ride home from ballet practice. Even when the camera is on her, his atrocity can be seen behind her in the reflection and vice versa. Everywhere she goes, and everything she does, eyes are on her at all times. This feeling of being continually observed is deeply embedded into the very fabric of this film. Black Swan might have the best use of this kind of mirror motif in the history of cinema, and it is easily what I enjoyed most about this film.    My one complaint about Black Swan, is something I knew was going to bother me going in. Reality gets so blurred that the supernatural significance of the hallucinations start to suffer. After a while, this film feels like it could just as well make up anything it wanted to as it went along. I never got this dissapointing feeling from Perfect Blue, which I feel has a much stronger conclusion and more valid reason for its many hallucination sequences. In Perfect Blue these nightmarish visions become the very root of the drama, in Black Swan they seem to exist mostly for effect. It is obvious to me that Black Swan barrowed heavily from Perfect Blue, but its hallucinations begin to seem random and made up on the fly. This has become a constant flaw that I have noticed in nearly every single modern film about psychological horror, had it been avoided here, I would of rated Black Swan five stars without hesitation. Regardless, Black Swan is still a very worthy movie that is going to have a special place in my DVD collection on the day that it is released. This is an effective dark nightmare that combines a great blend of beautifually choreographed dance sequences, surprising psychological shocks, and enough abject paranoia to keep the viewer delighfully disoriented from beginning to end. I definitely prefure Perfect Blue, but nonetheless, Black Swan is still a four star feature worthy of checking out.

Almost all of the interviews worked for me - very few didn't hold my interest.<br /><br />I enjoyed the views on living conditions, fear, weaponry, politics, responses compared worldwide.<br /><br />Yes, it's a book about zombies but a lot of what is in this book could be applied to any pandemic and thus, it becomes extremely timely and frightening.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.

B0012QE4Q2|5.0|This is an excellent film about the lust of Henry VIII.  Actually, people were no different then than they are now--total self-gratification and greed. Good people were the underdogs and often paid the price.  Compassion was not a consideration.

0756405890|5.0|Obviouly Pat Rothfuss doesn't need another review from me, but since I actually had my hands on that original draft, and since he's now one of my favorite authors, I had to write.<br /><br />Name of the Wind does what many novels today fail to do adequately--suspend disbelief. What this means is that Pat's writing has the capacity to transport the reader into an unreality that is more real than the very day in which we live. What this says to me is that he is a writer who has stayed true to his story. He has not written because he is a writer. He has written this story because he is a storyteller. Like Kvothe, he pulls us into his narrative because he himself believes what he is telling us: that heroes are not just born but made; that adversity teaches us to triumph; that we are born with homing devices that will lead us to be (as Dickens said) the heroes of our own lives--if only we had someone to teach us how to listen to ourselves.<br /><br />As for myself, I am glad to have had this long wait for Wise Man's Fear. I have loved living with the mystery and the question that Name of the Wind proposes, namely: Do I have it in myself to perservere? Patrick Rothfuss makes me think I do.
030746363X|5.0|Ferriss steals the entire architecture of Robert Atkins low-carb diet book from the 70s as a template, let's get that straight.<br />But then he goes ballistic.<br />The guy's research is the most outre I've encountered for extreme athletics.<br />He has an insane amount of data/science to back all of his claims.<br />And he is his own favorite guinea pig. He tests everything up the whazzoo, literally.<br />This dawns on the reader in a queasy way, when he encounters the word 'poo' in later chapters.<br />(wait until you get to it...)<br />I had to rush through the chapter on sex, as I found it a tad too graphic. Much like his earlier poo episode.<br />Other than that, Ferriss has included many excellent anecdotes and data on any number of interesting ways to work out, burn fat, gain muscle and to be an all around superhuman....<br />Great book.<br />And he's a very engaging writer.<br />Funny too....
0439023513|5.0|Katniss Everdeen, my personal favorite fictional character, has survived yet another Hunger Games and made a fool out of the Capital once again. Before long, an entire war between the districts and Capital has begun and Katniss, the Mockingjay, is the symbol of it. No one is safe and no one knows who to trust. To make matters worse, Peeta is in the hands of an angry President Snow. Now, all of our favorite characters from the series must take up their weapons and fight the war that they started, never looking back.<br /><br />I am completely blown away once again by Suzanne Collins' wonderfully written series. I've been sitting here staring at this screen for five minutes because I'm just speechless of where to even begin. Katniss. In this last book, a new side of Katniss emerges; she's still the tough and determined chick that I fell in love with, but at the same time is just plain human. All of her horrible experiences start to mess with her mind, leaving her depressed and numb. She was weak in parts of the book and just wanted to hide away for the rest of her life, which was so realistic! I think sometimes I forgot that she's still a maturing teenager coping with things way beyond her control, so it was nice seeing a more emotional side of her. I'm also so glad that her role as the Mockingjay, face of the rebellion, didn't get to her. She didn't take advantage of her authority or think she was better than anyone. Her only goal was to protect her loved ones and kill Snow. Katniss freaking kicks butt and does an amazing job at it.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has always written those violent and bloody scenes so raw that you can't stop reading but at the same time want to turn your eyes away from the pages. Out of all the books, I think this one was the hardest to read. It was torture for my heart to read about characters that I've grown so fond of, die for a noble cause. But the one thing that I think separates this series from any other is how real it is. Even though I didn't want certain characters to die, they did anyway. And later, after finishing the book, I'm glad they did. This wasn't a fairytale story or a feel-good kind of book. It was the raw truth of how life is and how humans treat each other. There was no sugarcoated ending or promise that everything was going to go back to normal. I'm just bewildered at how truly astounding this particular book and overall series is.<br /><br />I never knew what to expect next. There were twists and turns in each chapter that I didn't see coming and I read the entire second half of the novel in one sitting. I do think that it started out a bit slow but once they actually start going to war with the Capital head-on, it's a very intense read. I am still shocked that this favorite series of mine is actually over. I can only cross my fingers that the movie will be equally as powerful, enjoyable, emotional, and creative as this book was.certain characters to die, they did anyway.

B0017I1FNK|5.0|Obviously in an introspective mood, Emmylou Harris has produced a CD of songs about life, death, loss and longing.  Her voice is bright and clear, and the music is subdued and just what each song needs.  The overall sound is soothing and, as Garrison Keillor might say, just what a person always needs sometimes.  This CD has become my perpetual background music.  Get a copy of \\"All I Intended to Be,\\" put it in your CD player, and enjoy.
B001GAPC1K|1.0|Now that I have begun collecting blu ray I can realize if it is a fake or not and the Iron Man copy is a duplicate. thanks to Sony Database the information automatically generates when you play plus I noticed it stated BR - D not BR-Rom and there was no menu options. If I was going to buy a bootlegg I would have played a lot less but blu ray has so many heatures like online and hope no one buys anything from them because there misleading.
030745455X|4.0|Thanks to my friend Annie, I gave this series another try after being disappointed by the first book--all because of the cruddy and (mostly) predictable ending. So there I went, reading onward, feeling a little like a martyr--until it actually proved to be a good book! Very excited to read #3.

0312600844|5.0|Okay, so yes, there are flaws that reviewers have pointed out to us in all shapes and forms, but overall, this novel is incredible. It speaks to this current moment in American history, to a slice of society that hasn't been captured in quite this way. Maybe it speaks to a certain demographic more than another, but it speaks. It's an epic story with characters that bash themselves against the walls they and society have drawn around us. I couldn't put it down, couldn't stop smiling, couldn't stop talking about it. I loved it.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|This is the first headset I have used for gaming.  The set works well while playing games (Black Ops primarily) and really gives me a feel for what is going on around me.  I did not notice any surround sound effect, but by turning the character on screen, I could determine where sounds are coming from (right or left).     Others who have reviewed this product have mentioned a constant hiss, or background noise, while using this headset.  I can confirm that there is a hiss, and it is actually quite loud.  Additionally, when turning the playstation 3 on, or reseting it, there is a very loud screech as the headphones go active.  The first couple of times this happened, I wasn't ready for it, and it really hurt my ears.  At the $80 price break, I expect a little bit more in terms of quality.    The mic, though it has occasional problems with Black Ops, seems to work fine otherwise.  I don't know why that game specifically has occasional problems, but it does seem to be specific to that game, which is infamously buggy for the ps3 system.  I won't rank the headphones down for that.      Overall, I enjoy the product, but for the price, I'd prefer higher quality.  Overall, four stars, with a mark down for price vs quality for a total of three stars.
0240816250|5.0|If you are looking for a well written, concessive, amply illustrated, comprehensive text for B&W film processing, this is the book to get. It is much more than worth the price. This book was written for the film photographer who wants to know the how and the why of film processing including in-depth technical explanations for each step. It will also serve well those just interested in a quick review or start as the authors have included concise summaries of the multiple pages of charts and graphs. I don't think a better contemporary book for B&W photography exists anywhere.<br /><br />wd
B002VECM6S|4.0|Let me start by saying that Sandra Bullock was great - finally a perfect role for her. The story was also enjoyable enough, telling how a supersize teen finally gets a lucky break in his life and finds someone who really cares about him. The fact that it's based on a true story only makes it better. You definitely need to be a football person to enjoy the movie though, since they eat, drink, and breathe it.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|All in all, this is a powerful tale of the will to survive, which can - at points - be extremely difficult to watch.  I would like to note one shortcoming.  While director Danny Boyle dopely included sexual fantasies which Aaron Ralston supposedly experienced during his harrowing encounter, Boyle neglected to tell us what was simultaneously happening with Ralston's family and loved ones.  Are we to just assume that no one noticed that Ralston was missing?
B002ZG980U|4.0|Okay, I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but there were points in this movie where I felt that the directors were just kind of making it up as they went along. Way cool special effects, and fantastic action, but perhaps just a bit too complicated. That said, I did convinced to see it twice, hoping I could figure out just what level of dream was what and in whose mind. Never got it all worked out, but hey, still a very enjoyable movie.
B00140PK6O|5.0|A brilliant mini-series that is loved by guys and girls alike. It incorporates suspense, romance, comedy, drama, and culture all into one wonderful tale.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Unfortunately for me this book in no way could compare to the first or even the second book in the trilogy. While the sequels were good books in their own right they simply could not be seen through the glare of the shining star that is The Hunger Games.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|This movie is close to, if not a complete masterpiece.  Sam Rockwell delivers a stunning performance that will make you laugh, hurt, and possibly cry.  Clint Mansell delivers a moving and fitting score which is well worth hearing and fits the atmosphere of the movie perfectly.  The first time director, Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie), really outdoes himself.  I am looking forward to seeing his future productions.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan is one of the year's most acclaimed films, nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Watching it the first time I found it overrated and inferior to its companion film [[ASIN:B001TOD92C The Wrestler]]. Watching it a second time, I found it to be one of director Darren Aronofsky's most focused efforts. His skill and maturity as a director continues to grow and progress with each film and while it's too early to say if Black Swan is my favorite film by the man it may be his most impressive feature yet.    Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a dancer at a New York ballet company. It's the beginning of a new season and the first production is of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. With the former star Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) being cast out, the director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) must find a new dancer that can embody both the White Swan and her evil twin the Black Swan. Nina is dedicated to her craft, a perfectionist who knows every move perfectly. Newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis) is her opposite; free-spirited and effortless. Thomas knows Nina can dance the White Swan, but he's not sure she would able to convincingly dance the Black Swan. When Thomas finally casts Nina as the Swan Queen, she becomes so intent on perfecting her role that she begins transforming into the character (and what an amazing transformation it is).    Nina is a fascinating protagonist; an innocent and sexually repressed character living with a sinister, domineering mother (Barbara Hershey). Nina's fragile mental state is immediately apparent and the film being told from her perspective makes us always question whether what we're seeing is reliable. A portrait of a slow mental breakdown is nothing new in cinema, but it's the adventurous way it's handled in this film that makes it so special. Aronofsky obviously derives some inspiration from Roman Polanski, particularly Repulsion with its portrait of female sexual repression, but Black Swan doesn't descend into a retread of earlier material. It's an example of a film being culminated from various influences to create something very new and fresh.    Natalie Portman has received the majority of notice for her performance, but everyone here is worth mentioning. The stunning, beautiful Mila Kunis, in her first legitimate dramatic role, is perfect as Lily. Her character is a big part of the film, but one of the less complex roles. Still, she's a convincing opposite to Portman's Nina. Hershey is highly underrated doing some career-best work as Nina's mother. This is a stunning performance by an actress we don't see much of anymore and, in a less competitive year Hershey would've been a sure thing for an Oscar nomination. She brings such nuance to the simultaneously caring and overbearing mother role, making her loathsome yet sympathetic. Vincent Cassel is essentially playing the only male character in this film and he plays the charming, amoral, Svengali-like Thomas with a flamboyant subtlety that is brilliantly controlled and convincing. He's been accused of hamming it up, but I didn't get that impression. It's an Oscar-worthy performance that was unfortunately overlooked. Even Winona Ryder makes an impression with little screen-time.    Portman will win the Academy Award this year for her performance as Nina Sayers, not as a sympathy vote or to award her for her time in this industry, but because she gives a remarkable, psychologically complex performance and pulls it off flawlessly. Portman so completely captures Nina's fragility, innocence, and elegance while bringing her through a haunting and memorable transformation that never feels over-the-top or forced. She's so in control of her performance and, physically, she's gone out of her way to look the part as well. Already small, Portman lost 20 pounds for her role as Nina. It's a sympathetic performance of a complicated character. Nina isn't the greatest female protagonist of 2010, but Portman gives the greatest female performance of 2010.With more roles like this, Portman could establish herself as a force to be reckoned with. When Nina says \\"I was perfect,\\" you agree because of the job Portman has done here.    The cinematography by Matthew Libatique is very tight, emphasizing close-ups on the face, while giving the film a very raw feel. The film has a visual style that almost completely mirrors the grainy, muted look of The Wrestler, but Black Swan is a much more beautiful film. The hypnotic opening scene is so instantly intriguing it takes hold of your interest and leads you through the rest of the film. The terrific, sometimes terrifying makeup and beautiful score (which does incorporate much of the Swan Lake ballet) all lend beautifully to the tone created by Aronofsky.    Black Swan is not an easy film as it doesn't comfortably settle into any particular genre. It has the elements of a horror film and a psychological thriller but never quite falls into either genre, despite having many wince-inducing scenes. It has a European sensibility, evident in Aronofsky being influenced by Polanski's Repulsion and The Tenant and that might not sit well with some audiences. Other people may flock to the movie due to the highly publicized scene between Portman and Kunis (you know which one I'm talking about) which is neither gratuitous nor graphic and has supernatural element that may disappoint viewers hoping for something much more \\"arousing.\\"    For me, Black Swan really achieves greatness in the final 20 minutes which I found to be some of the gripping, powerful, and fascinating minutes of any movie from 2010. Even when using CGI effects, Aronofsky manages to simultaneously evoke emotion and challenge the viewer. Few films move me to tears, but Black Swan did even while knowing what to expect. Yes, it took a second viewing for me to really appreciate this film but I found myself blown away by it. It's an amazing film, a brilliant companion piece to The Wrestler, and an emotional rollercoaster ride. Black Swan is the most profound, moving cinematic experience I've had from a 2010 film. It's less of a film than an experience.    GRADE: A-
B002ZG976U|5.0|I went to see this movie because I was excited to see Cher in another movie, especially a musical.It did not dissapoint. The costumes,the dancing, the songs,all flowed together to make it a hit.I was so happy to see that Cher's song  got the number one award for best song,at The Golden Globe Awards.Those who have followed her life and career really felt the meaning behind that song.No one else could have played that part as well. Everyone in it made it superb.Perhaps the critics need to remember that not all of us want to watch deep dramas that usually end badly. Life is hard enough right now.Sometimes we want to just be entertained,and leave the theater with a smile.This movie did that, and more. I cannot wait to get my copy.Do not hesitate to own this one.
B00004TJKI|5.0|This is one of Otto Preminger's<br />best directed movies. Its so real<br />and well written and acted. Jimmy<br />Stewart and the entire cast are<br />excellent. I grew up watching<br />old movies on the late show in<br />the 70's when they only had 4<br />channels and I loved them. I<br />think most people today just<br />don't appreciate these movies.<br />Too many movies with no story and<br />bad acting and special effects are<br />being made and people just have no<br />attention span to actually watch a<br />movie with a story. The person who<br />said it's outdated should watch more<br />of these types of movies. Yes it's old<br />it was old when I watched it but it's<br />great american movie making that they<br />don't make anymore. Why is it they<br />keep remaking old movies? cause they<br />have run out of ideas but they ruin<br />the movies with special effects or<br />dumbing down the story. Sorry but<br />I'm a movie lover and I go to many<br />movies and I haven't seen anything<br />except True Grit that comes close to<br />this excellent movie. Give this a try!<br />Also try Laura! it's even better!
B003PIUC02|5.0|I can not remember how I came across this show but I'm glad I did.  I'd put this up there with Band of Brothers!  A group of men who go through hell and yet share some good times too.  They forge bonds that will never be broken.  It's the best $35 I've ever spent.  I bought the bluray and - wow!  I watched the final episode last night and wanted to yell 'did you see that!' but I was alone!  LOL  Amazing.  I'll be watching it again this week.  The characters are fantastic.  Acting is awesome, it could not be bettered it's as simple as that.  As for the story and the action - it doesn't stop.  Even during the quieter moments you are kept on the edge of your seat.  The blood and guts are very graphic, you'll see every type of death imaginable.  The nudity is, well, as visual as it can be without being pornography - but this is Rome and this is how we believe it was.  Blood, honor, sex and betrayal.  I can not wait for the second season - it's so sad that Andy (Spartacus) has cancer.  I hope he recovers and is back for season 3 as I've heard they have re-cast his role for season 2.  Born in Wales, a fine actor.    After watching this show I was on a high.  I've told all my family and friends and several have bought copies! do I get commission? LOL    To all involved in Spartacus - Bravo!  It's amazing!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This video came in great packaging and was 100%. The movie itself is fantastic if you like romance, England in the late 1800's, and if you want to believe that chivalry is not dead.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This one caught me by surprise.  Of course Richard Gere didn't.  He brings everything up a level.    The story is excellent.  The cinematography is very good.  I've watched it twice and look forward to sharing it with my friends from time to time.
B003QCCS36|5.0|I am not what one would consider a Ray Lamontagne fan, but rather someone who is familiar with his style and his more notable songs.  After hearing this album, I felt sick knowing that this music existed out there for four months without me knowing it.     In music, I like a lot of things, but find myself the most enamored and blown away by what I consider the entirety of the sound.  It's the combination of everything....emotion, voice, musical phrasing, accompaniment, pace and organization of a song or album to produce something greater than the sum of its parts.  This album delivers this in spades.  From the bare bones and visceral \\"Are We Really Through\\" to the smoky soul swagger in \\"Repo Man\\" you will experience a variety of sounds that definitely lean a bit more to the alt-country side than his prior albums.     His use of Eric Heywood and Greg Leisz brings a boatload of credibility to this album.  Leisz played for John Fogerty, Joni Mitchell, The Eagles, Beck, Wilco, Avenged Sevenfold, Smashing Pumpkins, Bruce Cockburn, Lucinda Williams, Alison Krauss & Robert Plant.  Heywood started with The Jayhawks and Sun Volt. Both are fantastic.    I am typically not one to press my musical tastes upon others, but I cannot stop telling people about this album.  It is that good.  It is worth your time.
B002VECMAE|1.0|The Men Who Stare at Goats is quite possibly the unfunniest movie I've ever seen.  Knowing full well I don't particularly care for George Clooney in the slightest going into the film, I was skeptical but thought I'd go for it anyway because, well -if for no other reason- just the utter ridiculousness of the concept judging by the television previews had me convinced that at LEAST on some extremely campy level I must be able to get some enjoyment out of it.  I was wrong.    Well, the actual \\"staring at the goats\\" doesn't really take up much of the storytelling.  Instead, what DOES take up the majority of the storyline is nothing but a bunch of incredibly pointless things such as, to name some examples, trying to dance in a military room but being afraid because of devastating childhood memories, looking at clouds and studying their movements, carelessly driving into rocks in the desert, and a bunch of other equally terribly unfunny segments.     This honestly doesn't even come close to qualifying as comedy in my book.  I should have listened to that little voice in my head telling me to avoid it.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Having read many reviews here and other places I think a common mistake is using Band of Brothers as the measuring stick for what the Pacific should be.  Many people went into The Pacific expecting it to be Band of Brothers in a different time zone.  If that is what you expect, you'll probably be disappointed.  The Pacific does not follow the same formula of following one group of soldiers through the war beginning to end.  Even if that is how the producers wanted to structure the 10 part series it would have been very difficult given the fighting in the Pacific went on for 3 and 1/2 years while (Northern) Europe was fought and won is less than 1 year.  Guys get killed and rotated back too quickly to expect a story to be told about just one group over 3 1/2 years in the Pacific and be able to get to know that group as intimately as we do in BoB.    Instead The Pacific follows the story of 3 Marines during the war.  Each of the men contrast one another and they all endure wide-ranging experiences over the course of the war giving the viewer an opportunity to become intimate with what they went through.  I found the journey fantastic.  The series brings out just how different the war was in the Pacific vs. Europe, from the weather to the Japanese soldier.    Because of just how different the war was in the Pacific vs. Europe, the series is perhaps not quite as entertaining in the traditional sense.  There is simply more misery displayed.  The nature of the war and the reality of trying to follow 3 individuals does also make one have less opportunity to get to know the peripheral characters and make the series more disjointed (i.e. they simply do not have enough time to cover everything).  Part of me wishes they could have extended the series a few episodes for this reason.  One additional point I must mention is the sexual content in the series.  I would have preferred it to be more toned down in series like this so it would be seen by a widest audience possible.  I fear the sexual content will prevent young people from seeing it - much more than its violent content - so I find it unfortunate.   Having said all that, The Pacific stands on its own as a great miniseries.  The production quality is high, there are some superb battle scenes and truly emotional moments.    I highly recommend The Pacific (as well as \\"With the Old Breed\\" - E.B. Sledge).    PS - the blu-ray extra features are excellent.
B000002GYN|3.0|For those of you in the same category I am (that being, extremely annoyed at the typical classic rock format) it's extremely important to avoid the three popular hits- \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\", \\"Witchy Woman\\" and \\"Take It Easy\\".  These three songs have been beaten into the ground over and *over* again for close to 40 years now.  Enough is enough.      Most people who don't like those songs wouldn't even bother listening to the rest of the album (let alone the rest of the Eagles discography) but I'm no ordinary person, am I?   No I'm not- I'm different!    My favorite is the banjo-upbeat \\"Earlybird\\".  I absolutely love this song.  The vocal melody is spectacular, and the background vocals work extremely well.  The guitar appears in all the appropriate spots.  It really DOES feel like you're up early in the morning, making coffee, yawning and hearing birds outside in your little bird fountain splashing water around and just entertaining themselves.  The wonderful sounds of nature... which isn't the same thing as nature calling.  That would be what happens whenever you hear the three hits I mention in the first paragraph, lol.    \\"Train Leaves Here This Morning\\" is one of those lazy day, front porch \\"just a man and his basset hound\\" bluesy-type songs, and it has a LOT of spiritual energy in the way the vocals are sung.  I seriously mean it.  I can't BELIEVE it wasn't a big hit.  Why the heck not???  \\"Take the Devil\\" is a foot-stomper of a good time.  Perhaps the same man on his front porch is now standing up and stomping his foot to this particular rhythm?  As he walks off and leaves the property, he recalls a past memory that once was.  This is what happens during the guitar solo at the end as the dust picks up and the instrument intensifies.  Envision it!    \\"Most of Us are Sad\\" aren't we?  Secretly we are.  Whether it's because we're lonely or because (in my case) we're in physical pain from an infected wisdom tooth extraction (the pain isn't going away after 10 days, ugh.  Think it's time to call the doctor) we are all in fact, feeling some sort of pain.  Sometimes it sticks around for a while, other times it comes and goes.  However there's good news.  No I'm not a doctor and can't extend your lifespan, but I *can* assure you that this is definitely a quality tune.  I can assure you of that.    \\"Nightingale\\" contains such a lovely vocal melody.  Nice and sweet!  A perfect 70's song.  It makes me wanna jump with joy upon hearing a song like this.  Most people are probably secretly jealous they can't write a vocal melody that good, I bet.  It's okay- I'm jealous too.  I just wasn't awarded such talent.  \\"Well tell the lord above, she's got a brand new love, that cannot fail\\".  That's one of at least THREE memorable vocal melodies contained in just this song alone.  And to think, there's times I go through three or four Eagles songs in a row from some of their future albums and don't even hear *one* decent melody!  What happened?    The Eagles have a great debut.  It's your job to fight those inner feelings and desires to pick up their greatest hits albums (any NUMBER of them, at this point).

I am a philosopher of science and former evolutionary biologist, and I highly recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in the biology and social science of gender.<br /><br />It is nowadays commonly accepted knowledge that there are profound innate differences between genders. I'm not talking about the obvious anatomical ones, but about the allegedly (radically) different ways in which male and female brains work. It seems that at every corner we hear statements to the effect that gender XX or XY is better or more capable or more attracted to a litany of tasks and behaviors, from spatial abilities to mathematics, from aptitude toward science to liking the color pink. When prominent figures -- like former Harvard President Larry Summers -- get in trouble for talking about behavioral gender differences as if they were established facts backed by the power of evolutionary and neuro-biology, a chorus of defenders rises up to decry political correctness and to present the Summers of the day as a valiant fighter for rationality in the face of relativism and demagoguery.<br /><br />Not so fast, says Cordelia Fine in her Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. Fine is an academic psychologist and freelance writer, and her book ought to be kept side by side with the likes of the (antithetical) The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker, to provide a bit of balance to what has become common and yet largely unfounded knowledge about gender differences. Let us be clear at the outset that nobody is seriously suggesting that genetics and evolution have nothing to do with human behavior, including gendered differences. Rather, Fine's claim is that a lot is being taken for established these days on the basis of much too flimsy evidence -- and more importantly that the widening consensus among scientists and the general public about the innateness (and consequent inevitability) of gender differences has a measurable and pernicious effect on women.<br /><br />Nature and nurture surely interact in complex ways, particularly in an animal so behaviorally flexible as a human being. But the danger of \\"neurosexism\\" (and evolutionary sexism) is that public pronouncements by scientists far outpace the evidence, with the result of reinforcing stereotypes and negatively affecting millions of lives. Scientists have an ethical duty, as Wittgenstein put it in another context, to remember that whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.ifferences has a measurable and pernicious effect on women.

0312427999|5.0|Naomi Klein offers a compelling and frightening account of the Chicago School, Milton Friedman, and how they altered world politics and world geopolitical history since the Chilean coup and assassination of Allende in the early 70's (and how badly our media has botched the truth in giving accounts that were weighted in favor of conservative economic ideology).  I am oversimplifying -- suffice it to say that this book is a must read.

B003VMIGM8|1.0|Wish I had never rented or watched this one.  Oh My!  I never imagined these actors would be in a movie of this ilk.  Sorry but, I felt defiled and had to turn it off.  I let the names of the actors lure me into renting this one but have definitely learned a huge lesson.  Wouldn't even give this one 1 star.  This one goes into the negative numbers of stars for me.

B000035Z3K|4.0|I bought this DVD after reading David Skal's book about stage and film productions of \\"Dracula\\", and I have to say, he is overstating the difference in quality between the two versions presented here a little. I would agree with Skal that the Spanish version is actually better, but although it features great acting (especially the actor playing the Renfield-character is bursting with raw energy) and interesting visuals, it still suffers from an editing style which by today's standards is so slow that it sometimes becomes distracting (and I mean not just in comparison with today's action films). Most importantly, the film is worlds away from being scary. I watched with my housemates, and we actually had great fun. Murnau's version, though even older, is far more disturbing than anything you'll get to see here. That general staleness, which I felt although I am used to watching very old films, is the reason why I give this film only four stars.  In short: if you're a collector of vampire films or a person with a knack for the early talkies, you're in luck and definitely should get a copy of this. If you are looking for something scary to add to your horror-collection, go for \\"Nosferatu\\", Coppola's Dracula, or the fantastic \\"Låt den rätte komma in\\".

B00005JKOI|4.0|You know, I just finished watching Pretty In Pink with Molly Ringwald, Jon Cryer, & Andrew McCarthy. I love, love, love the movie. The music just totally saves it for me. The Furs, OMD, Echo, & even some Manilow. Ok, I'm a Fanilow so I have to admit to liking the man's music. Don't shoot me. INXS, New Order, MORRISSEY. Some serious good music compiled. I remember owning the tape (totally dating myself now) and playing it until it stretched beyond repair, or maybe the tape deck ate it? Either way, once upon a time I owned the soundtrack. New quest: regain music soundtrack.<br /><br />The storyline is your typical John Hughes 80's storyline. That I can cope with. I am after all a child of the 80's and still think it was the greatest decade to date for music. But that's just MHO. One thing though. I can get over Andie's (Molly Ringwald) annoying lips and bad teeth.  Blane's (Andrew McCarthy) inability to man-up in the movie (seriously why does Andie go back to Blane after he wimped out on her? Disaster!) I still don't understand why Duckie (Jon Cryer) was not given the respect he like totally deserved. I mean after all he is the Duck Man! Duckie has the best lines throughout the whole flick...yeah, I went there. Flick.<br /><br />What I cannot and will not get over is Andies dress. I mean seriously. She's supposed to be this phenomenal sewer, a worker of miracles. She screw's up the courage to show up to prom with no +1 and her high noon showdown dress is that? I remember back in the day when I originally saw this movie at the theatre by the bowling alley...ALHS people, you know the one I'm talkin bout...seriously she wore that unflattering thing? I just don't get it even to this day. I mean seriously. She had the potential to really wow them and let them know she is not a loser, but she shows up in that pink on pink polka dot sack? Bad show. Now Duckie on the other hand...looked Sharp! Go Duckie!<br /><br />Even though I once again experienced the sad disappointment that is/was Andies showdown dress I still had a good time listening to the great music of my generation. I will of course watch again. Need to repurchase the DVD/Blu-Ray. Now to start out on my soundtrack quest....<br /><br />There!

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|As someone who's struggled with weight all my life, I read this book with amazement, anger, and finally hope.  Amazement because nearly early everything I have been told for more than 40 years about gaining and losing weight, and what constitutes a healthy human diet, is apparently wrong.  Anger because it seems like the correct science and information has been available for quite some time, and needless suffering has been caused by the fact that government agencies, the medical profession, and journalists have all been passing on advice that is not only not helpful, but has in fact been downright harmful.  And finally hope, because if Gary Taubes' analysis is correct, better health and a healthier weight is not beyond our reach.  No matter what your current beliefs about diet are, this is a must-read.  It will make you question all your assumptions, and I hope it makes you ask a lot of questions and seriously re-evaluate how you eat.
1594202842|5.0|I loved this simultaneously heartfelt and hilarious look at one woman's modern parenting. Professor Chua has a great, witty writing style that kept me reading on into the night in anticipation of what would happen next. She is incredibly down to earth and refreshingly self-deprecating in this tongue in cheek narrative. The stories are sure to amaze and delight as she works to push her children to be the best they can be - and she succeeds! Her children are not only amazingly accomplished but have grown into strong, charismatic, and amazing young women.     For those negative reviews I see, I am convinced that many of those reviewers did not read past the first chapter. And those who did, did not do so critically.     It is refreshing to read about a family that loves each other so much and works together to each be so successful. You can relate to her struggle to give her children every advantage possible as she prepares them for the harsh world out there.

0316017922|5.0|Fortunately for those of us who enjoy Mr. Gladwell's books, in Outliers we have been given yet another excellent opportunity to consider the workings of society from a fresh angle. The four points of this latest book are efficiently presented, then supported with many truly entertaining examples! While some complain that Gladwell never actually proves his points, but merely piles on anecdotal evidence in a less-than-scientific manner, I relished the invitation to use my own brain  to decide whether I agreed with the author's point of view. I was fascinated to learn more about the elements of success of celebrities such as Bill Gates and the Beatles, as well as the systems involved in air traffic control and Chinese math. Readers will enjoy taking the information from this book and asking themselves: \\"Yes it's interesting - but is it true? And, if agreed, how can I use this information myself?\\" And that is, after all, the most satisfying part of bothering to read any book!
0812580346|3.0|Having watched the Flash Forward series, and being left hanging by its untimely demise; I thought that I would read the book to find out the \\"end game\\".  No dice.  The book is so different from the TV series and vice versa, as to be almost unrecognizable!  Except for the basic idea of the flash forward itself, there is little in common with the two.  Only 2 of the characters are the same, Lloyd Simco is the lead , there is no FBI, no hospital... etc.  Quite frankly... I preferred the TV series to the book.  More complex with a double touch of conspiracy.

Since that time, I've read all of Marian Keyes' work, but this and \\"The Last Chance Saloon\\" remain my favorites.     Great characters, believable premise, surprise twist I should have seen coming...just all around a terrific book.

0811870413|2.0|This book would've benefited from a good editor. Lovely pictures, but a cleaner presentation of each recipe is preferable for the home baker. The baguette recipe in particular is cumbersome (see page 129 in the Amazon preview.) You must refer back to previous pages twice during this recipe (Page 52, Step 4 and Page 56, Step 6.) It also isn't fully explained whether you add the salt alone or with the additional 50 grams of water. If you haven't read each recipe (which go on for pages) in advance prior to starting you may be in for some surprises. Tip, make your poolish as well as your leaven the night before for the baguette recipe or add another 3 hrs to your baking time.
B003Q6D27S|3.0|The long-running \\"[[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]]\\" series comes to a conclusion with yet another gruesome installment. \\"Saw: The Final Chapter\\" (renamed from its theatrical version, \\"Saw 3D\\") attempts to wrap up any and all loose ends within 90 minutes in an effort to ensure that Jigsaw's legacy will not go on. Unfortunately the film-makers just can't get out of their own way and what the viewer is left with is just another \\"Saw\\" movie that provides no real closure but rather leaves a few loose ends dangling in the wind. But hey, the traps are pretty cool!<br /><br />To explain the plot(s) would be an insufferable headache. So to keep it simple, the test subject at hand here is a self-help guru (Sean Patrick Flannery) who claims to have survived one of Jigsaw's life-changing traps. Unfortunately for him, somebody is on to his secret and puts him to the test to see if he can truly live up to the story he has built his fame upon. You can almost see Tony Robbins squirming in his seat with each and every gnarly and nasty trap laid out on-screen.<br /><br />If you've seen all six \\"Saw\\" movies leading up to \\"The Final Chapter\\" then you pretty much know what to expect. Fact is, the series was played out about four installments ago, but the writers (Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan) have done a remarkable job of pulling plot devices out of thin air and creating new characters for us to despise. Speaking of despicable, beware of the acting in this film, which hits an all-time low. The worst offender of all would be Chad Donella, who plays newbie detective Adam Gibson. Donella obviously studied at the Matthew McConaughey school of acting and serves more as the unintentional comic relief of the show than an actual tangible protagonist.<br /><br />Having knocked the film for its convoluted plot and horrendous acting (Flannery, you're alright), it must be said that \\"Saw: The Final Chapter\\" at least delivers what the fans expect at this point. There's plenty of gore to go around with the traps themselves being every bit as outlandish and uncomfortable as you'd expect. Long-time fans will get a smile on their face as an old character comes back for one more round, which is appropriate because at this point nobody else but the die-hards are following along. Shamelessly, the film wraps up in an all-too predictable fashion, leaving the door wide open for the inevitable \\"Saw VIII: A New Beginning.\\" Game over?

B004DK49DW|5.0|\\"Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes\\" is almost like a re-birth for So-Cal's Social Distortion. Not only is it their first piece of new music since 2004's \\"[[ASIN:B0002TGYXG Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll]]\\" but it is also the first to feature new bassist Brent Harding and the first release for the band under the Epitaph label. No worries, though, as Mike Ness and his merry band of misfits deliver the goods as expected, ensuring not only that the wait was worth it but that the music is true to the Social Distortion brand as well, even after all these years and so many band members have passed by.<br /><br />From the opening licks of the instrumental opener, \\"Road Zombie,\\" \\"Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes\\" establishes itself as a feel-good punk-rock record that grapples with Ness' newfound clarity while paying tribute to the band's roots and influences. Southern rock and gospel are peppered in numbers like \\"California (Hustle and Flow)\\" and \\"Can't Take it With You,\\" while blues-ier numbers such as \\"Bakersfield\\" sounds like classics from the band's back catalog finally coming to the surface. Throughout the album's eleven tracks, Ness chronicles his various struggles, re-affirming his existence on tracks like \\"Still Alive\\" which, in spite of some hammy lyrics, offers a glimmer of hope not often found in punk. Of course, the classic Social D attitude is alive in well in the album's stand-out track, \\"Machine Gun Blues,\\" which pays tribute to Ness' obsession with gangster culture and rocks harder than anything else passing for mainstream punk these days.<br /><br />If any criticism can be leveled against the album, it's that the production is way too clean. The album was produced by Ness, so it should come as no surprise that it was hemmed and hawed over multiple times and the results sound very middle-of-the-road at times, lacking the intensity of previous releases. What's important is the songs, though, and in that respect Ness and company deliver. \\"Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes\\" may not be the definitive Social Distortion album, but it's certainly a hard-hitting and well-written album that fans from all walks of life are likely to appreciate.efinitive Social Distortion album, but it's certainly a hard-hitting and well-written album that fans from all walks of life are likely to appreciate.

Given the author's opening statistics ( one man in two / one woman in three will get cancer  ) I think this book is worth everyone reading. After finishing this is what I wrote Dr. Mukherjee:  Dear Dr.  Mukherjee ,  I just finished your book and want to thank you for the immense effort I'm sure it entailed. I am a 64 year old recently retired Ophthalmologist and a nine year male breast cancer survivor. Cancer had a lot to do with my going into medicine at age 30 after 9 years working as a physicist- during college I worked in a chemical production building which had multiple co-workers die of oat cell cancer from exposure to bis chloromethyl ether ( NEJM 288:1096-1097May 24, 1973 ;[...]).  At age 64 I'm old enough to have had several other friends succumb to various forms of cancer. The personal stories you included in the book reflected well on the emotions we all experience when losing a loved one to cancer and captured your own compassion. Thanks again for all your efforts and keep up the research.   Jim Weeks

B0042EJD8A|5.0|Grassland is a provocative film about drilling for natural gas.<br /><br />Josh Fox's film is a diary of his travels around the country exploring what happens when unbridled drilling for natural gas is allowed. The film starts off innocently, he talks about his hippie parents that built the house where he grew up in Pennsylvania, and the beautiful stream that he played in as a child. The turning point of the film is when he discusses a land lease offer he received for drilling rights on his property. The $100,000 is tempting, but he wants to understand more about what he could sign away.<br /><br />The film is built very nicely around Josh's discovery of how the American public gave away our stewardship of public land to allow drilling rights. Strong supporters of the Bush administration will be offended by this film, and will likely find fault with Josh's logic. Josh does understand dramatic effect very well; he opens the film with actual congressional testimony that is not easily comprehended. He closes the film with essentially the same footage, and the testimony now makes sense, the glossing over of facts is apparent. In short, I learned a lot watching this film, and Josh reminded me of how much I learned.<br /><br />Technically this is probably some of the worst camera work ever recorded on video. The video switches from clear high definition to enlarged horrible standard definition. The live sound recording is badly done, sometimes dialog is clear but sometimes it is incomprehensible. Where Josh Fox excels is editing and his voice over narration. He has built a compelling film that overcomes all the horrendous technical problems. He very gradually, logically builds his case.<br /><br />The most memorable footage is the countless views of different drilling sites flying past his open car window as he drives. I was not aware that those were gas drilling sites, and recall driving through these states seeing so many of them, they end up looking like trees along the highway.<br /><br />Before watching this film I honestly thought that natural gas was simple to collect, drill a hole in the ground, pierce the natural gas tank in the ground, purify the gas, compress it, and deliver it through pipelines. After watching this film, it is clear natural gas is a very complex thing to mine. In the end it is also a very toxic resource to extract from the ground. A very similar problem is happening with carbon dioxide being pumped underground in Canada. The toxic side effects are greater than what anyone imagined.<br /><br />Josh delivers an excellent message with this film, it is important to become educated about our environment. Sometimes things are much more complex than they seem on the surface. He reminds us that seemingly innocent decisions can have big impact in our own backyard.<br /><br />August 3, 2014 Update: I recently read a good book that is the counterpoint to Gasland, The Fracking Truth. This is a well written, clear, unemotional, non-confrontational counterpoint to this film. I started reading the book expecting to hate it, yeah why would I listen to anybody that has something to do with the oil industry? After the first few pages, I read with an open mind. There is a lot more to the subject than presented in this film - the solution and the problem are not as simple as it might seem on the surface. Oh the simple answer from Gasland is oppose all drilling, period, it is too dangerous and will ruin our world. Frankly, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />My point - I would encourage anybody really interested in this subject to read The Fracking Truth. Understand both sides of the argument.<br />[[ASIN:0985070374 The Fracking Truth:America's Energy Revolution: the Inside, Untold Story]]<br /><br />And in the interim, I have put my money where my mouth is - I now drive two full electric cars - haven't been to a gas station in almost a year.

Because you normally when you read the book, you don't like the movies at all!  Well, I was pleasantly wrong...it was definitely different from the books and it's hard to relate to the characters especially Jason...he's definetly not in the books as much as in the series, and Tara too...who I wish they would have just left out of the series, but after I was done with the HBO Series, I realized I loved the Show too....SO I HAD to go and buy Season 2, which of course I did...and then of course I had to watch Season 3...and still love it!!! NOw I have the new book coming out this summer, AND the new Series 4 coming out this summer too....what fun I'm going to have.  I recommend the books and the series, they're both great...but remember I said that they are the same, but they are different, I like the story better in the books....but I needed a fix and the Series did it :)
0385341679|4.0|After waiting for over a year and being active on both Amazon.com and Karen Moning's message boards, I am ambivalent on this book.  First, for anyone interested in purchasing this book, please make sure you have read all the previous fever books first and do not skip.  I got hooked on Karen's books from reading the Highlander series and then stumbled onto the Fever series.  While there are some references from Highlanders, meaning the Kelters, she is not consistent in which she presents the Unseelie King...I was pretty happy in the read until the very end when Mac has her final encounter with the Unseelie King.  I wont say more because I do not believe is spoiling the whole story.  Some previous reviews stated that Karen wrote too much about Mac talking to her herself... well I disagree!  It was important to \\"feel\\" what Mac was feeling in order to get why she going the route she was.  Descriptively it was ok again until the end.  I do find it disheartening that the Kelter's were written in this book the way they were.  Also many references were made about her previously written book \\"into the Dreaming\\" which is out of print and cannot be purchased.  I also do not like the fact that she made the Unseelie King too godlike...All in all this is a good read - curious to see why likes ahead for the Moning fans!
B003DZX44I|5.0|I loved this movie when I was younger, so I wasn't sure when I bought it recently in blu-ray if I'd still like it, and of course I did....and of course singing along with it, luckily nobody else was home :)  They did a wonderful job putting this to Blu-Ray, it looks beautiful on my HD TV! :)
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This edition comes with a Blu-ray disc of the movie (which looks awesome), as well as a DVD edition, a Mucic CD, and a special features Disc. It also has some booklets with stories about making the movie. All-in-all a nice compilation for the price.
0385342020|3.0|This is my first Sophie Kinsella book.  I enjoyed it, for the most part, though the heroine drove me crazy in parts with her decisions.  Suspension of disbelief is a must (as can be expected with a story featuring a ghost as a main character), since I sometimes was annoyed with how \\"easy\\" some things were for Lara because Sadie took care of them for her.      I also feel that the lead-up to the big showdown with Uncle Bill took too long and the climax was far too short--I would have culled out about 100 pages from the middle and spent more time dealing with the resolution.  This book could have been 300 pages instead of 435.    I found myself wishing the necklace and painting were real!
1439181780|5.0|This book is a \\"read\\" and \\"re-read\\" type of material.  You cannot possibly absorb all of its truth and wisdom in just one sitting.

B0038BBA4I|1.0|I know that everyone thinks that they are cool if they love this cd, but I find it to be a sorry rip-off of folk/bluegrass music. There are enough great bands such as this in the USA that never get their due respects that I find it amusing that a second-rate band such as this from England can get so much hype as it does. The hype reminds me of the Monkees and the sound reminds me of lesser grade banjo bands. Sorry, I have to say save your money unless you have much to spend on frivolities such as this.  I give it a one star only because I have never seen a zero star before.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|My son bought this headset for his PS3 and found it to be the best one out there.  He tried others, but didn't like it nearly as much as this one. He said he can hear his friends very clearly when he is playing online. He can also mute, so he can talk to us without he friends hearing, and his has a volume button to be able to raise/lower his friends, and the background noise.      He definately highly recommends this headset for anyone w/a PS3. It works GREAT and the price it reasonable.  You WON'T be unhappy!!! He has owned it for three months now and is still very happy with it. He uses it everyday!
B0015DROBO|4.0|I agree with some of the other reviews. There is entirely too much back story.  While reading this I remember thinking it like I was on a roller coaster.  Once I started getting interested a lot of useless information was thrown at me. The fact that this was a translated book could be why there were some poorly written sentences.  On the up side this had a great story line.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes suspense. I am confident after you finish you will be happy you did.
0385341679|5.0|This was the best book in the Fever series! Karen Marie Moning is an excellent writer. She does such a good job of making you feel what Mac is feeling. I laughed, I cried. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that everything is explained. The only problem I had with it was that the book is huge! I ended up buying it for my Kindle, too, and finished the whole thing in three days! I will miss Mac, but Karen did a great job of wrapping everything up. Was most definitely worth the wait!

B002JH3TW8|5.0|This is a great product to bridge older FW400 devices/cables to FW800. The product is well made, and I agree with other reviewers re: it's nice to have a short cable between the 800 and 400 ports on the adapter -- this seems to relieve some of the tension/stress on the computer's FW port. I purchased the adapter to connect a Canon HV30 camcorder with FW400 cable to a MacBook Pro, which only has FW800 port. It works perfectly. I have also used the cable to daisy chain the Canon HV30 into a Western Digital My Book 1TB, and My Book Studio LX 2TB -- worked like a charm on both devices. I would recommend this product.
1559277734|5.0|I actually picked up this audio book on a lark, and am really thrilled that I did.  I am a regular listener of audio books and use this time travelling too and from work to enjoy.  All Creatures Great and Small was  easy to listen too with the tales of Dr Herriott you can almost picture yourself there,as he travels from one experience to the next.  The stories are detailed and vivid and so much so that  I find myself looking forward to my morning and evening drive just to hear the next few chapters.  I thought this audio book was excellent to say the least and will be picking up the next in the series.

B0041KKYD8|1.0|[[ASIN:B004BLTNL6 I Spit on Your Grave]], originally titled Day of the Woman, was a 1978 film that was notoriously vile garbage somewhat noteworthy for being dissected brutally by Roger Ebert in his scathing synchronal zero star review.  But still, it was notoriously vile garbage before anything else quite like it was ever made, and believe it or not in some circles that counts for something, if only for being the first of its kind.  Additionally, the original film may have been meant as a pro-feminist reaction to violence against women created by an idiot who doesn't know how to make movies, but obviously its a stretch to find any artistic merit at all.  So now, some 32 years later we get a remake that we can assume not only contains even more diluted messages for its defenders but also even more ammunition for its detractors, especially given the feminist movement in the United States has really been inactive for pretty much the same three decades since the release of the original film.  It doesn't matter though because some horror films today believe they are beyond having artistic value and somehow immune toward scrutiny of their motives.  The I Spit On Your Grave remake is not quite as shocking and disgusting as the original considering the time period, but it is even more shameful for being long, stupid, gratuitous torture porn that contains some horrifically bad acting and writing.  It is truly one of the most disdainful pieces of filth I've had the displeasure of enduring in quite some time.  It is crucial to note that my distaste for this movie is less so for its unsettling content than for how the actors are mismanaged and likely untalented anyway, and because they are reciting foolish dialogue.<br /><br />In case you didn't know already I Spit On Your Grave is a movie about a girl named Jenny (Sarah Butler) who retreats to a cabin in the middle of nowhere to write.  She is haunted by the ultimate redneck stereotypes who eventually rape her.  The second half of the film covers her violent revenge, which contains some insanely implausible and unfortunately nowadays all-too-typical over the top horror-film violence.  Both the rape scene and the revenge scenes are what makes this movie appealing to someone out there.  The sexual violence in this movie is the solitary reason for its existence and no one sensible person can dispute otherwise.  Obviously I have an issue with that and if you don't, well, enjoy your movie.<br /><br />I cringe giving this movie any credit whatsoever, but its star Sarah Butler can be partially exonerated.  She is perhaps a bit too pretty for this kind of movie and actually seems to have found some inspiration to act here in flashes.  She might even have talent.  I don't know why that happened but I sort of feel sorry for her.  It's actually a brave role and maybe she intended to show someone out there what she is willing to sacrifice.  Its other young actors are simply not good enough to defend but I don't want to blame them too much either.  In fact, the blame lies almost exclusively with the very idea that this kind of film can and probably will make money.  The irresponsible interaction between huckster and suckered patron is the real story here.  Please don't pay a dime to see this movie.e film covers her violent revenge, which contains some insanely implausible and unfortunately nowadays all-too-typical over the top horror-film violence.

B001KL3GWM|5.0|This is another CD that falls into our family category of \\"buy two:\\" the first, being immediately snatched upon delivery by my son, then a replacement for me.  The two of us have been following Derek's solo career for years, probably going to at least five of his concerts as his music matured.  He found his full voice in this album.

B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|I can honestly say that there aren't a whole lot of books I have read that I didn't like, but I did not like this book. I thought it was hard to get into it at first and when I finally did, I was just wanting the get through the book to be done with it. I usually really love Jodi Picoult's characters but in this book I didn't make that connection. To me it just seemed kind of boring. Even after I finished the book I wasn't exactly sure why she felt like her only option was suicide. My recommendation is to skip this book and read some of the other Jodi Picoult books instead!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|The Picture is stunning.  Its head and shoulders above Earth.  I love the \\"behind the scenes\\" of how they shot the different parts.  Very entertaining and enjoyable.      Worth every penny especially on blu-ray.  Its something you put in to show off the picture of your TV!

I mean, ITS THE EXACT SAME DISC. I popped the dvd in and the menu screen is the same, everythign was the same. its the same disc just recycled into a new package. It claims \\"new film transfer from  the original negative\\". If 2001 was new then yes. I feel so ripped off. If you already have any of the anchor bay releases then don't waste your time on this release. Its the same one thats been out for years. i was hoping to get the original mono sound and mayeb somehting new but nope its all old stuff recycled for a new package what a let down.

B0028DRGDQ|4.0|I am a huge fan of the zombie genre, and foreign horror films. REC. is definitely one of my favorites. No time to get all philosophical and deep about it, but I like this film because I can imagine myself in this particular situation..you know...being trapped in a closed area with people infected with a weird strand of super rabies?..In fact, this is why I love  zombie-esque films in general. If you have watched quarantine,  then you should definitely check out REC, the inspiration behind the American phenomenon.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I'd never watched a single episode of \\"The Tudors\\" before, but recently I finished viewing the series in its entirety. Leave aside the fact that the costumes and the production design make films like \\"Barry Lyndon\\" and \\"Amadeus\\" look like a high school play by comparison. Leave aside all the courtly manners and pretty speech, and the fact that this program actually contains the line: \\"Seize him!\\" Here's the story in a nutshell:<br /><br />-The Vatican says: \\"You must follow God's law - that is, the law of the Catholic Church, and ONLY persecute, torture, and kill heretics as we see fit.\\"<br /><br />-England says: \\"NO! We shall create our own Church, free from your superstitious tyranny, corruption and repression; and in our new, enlightened Church of England, we shall ONLY persecute, torture, and kill heretics as WE see fit, may it please you my good sir! I said GOOD DAY, sir!\\"<br /><br />I tell ya, nothing's better for executions than a religion that tells people that being sentenced to death by the king is equivalent to being sentenced to death by \\"God.\\"<br /><br />Showtime's \\"The Tudors,\\" like HBO's \\"Rome,\\" front-end loads the program with sex scenes, fights and jousting, brutal executions, and intricate political plotting. Unlike \\"Rome\\", however, the sex scenes and fights have vanished by the time you get to the final season, and the series ends on a melancholy, wistful note, as all the characters have grown old and fretful. There is no \\"final showdown\\" in Season 4; however, you do finally get the satisfaction of seeing an arrest warrant for \\"heresy\\" get totally slammed back in some smug bishop's face after four seasons of \\"Everybody who gets arrested gets executed, no second chances\\", plus a few other pleasant surprises before the end.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, an actor I'd never seen in anything before, shows impressive range in the role of Henry. For the first 3 seasons, the scenery-chewing Rhys-Meyers rampages terrifyingly, loves deeply then turns a cold shoulder to former lovers, and is seized by fits of sociopathic paranoia and stop-on-a-dime changes of mind, all the well known things that caused Henry VIII to become a byword for tyranny and unstable personality among latter-day historians. However, in the final season, Rhys Meyers is just as convincingly old and sorrowful, and even unhappy as he appears to look back over his problem-plagued reign. There's a scene in which Edward Seymour (Max Brown) , his minister, comes to Henry to tell him there was a failed coup against his cabinet, and Henry almost looks regretful that they didn't carry it out, and then he appears sincerely heartbroken because he learned the coup was being led by a longtime friend and supporter.<br /><br />I guess, to Henry, his entire reign, his whole life, had been the Vatican and various countries (or else his own guys) plotting against him, and almost all the women he loved ended up getting found \\"guilty\\" of , A, witchcraft, B, sleeping around, or, C, just plain old being barren, or they died during childbirth. Still, the program makes it hard to sympathize with a king who always seems ready to authorize his corrupt ministers to carry out all kinds of atrocities in his name.<br /><br />Yes, there's some stupid soap opera crap in this program, lots and lots of \\"plotting against people,\\" only it's not really like a soap opera because the end result of these plots is not the characters getting head-bonk induced amnesia or falling into comas or some crap, they're getting BEHEADED! One aspect of \\"The Tudors\\" that really deserves criticism, in my opinion, is its somewhat grating repetitiveness. Nearly everybody is plotting to get into the King's good favor, and, again and again, they do this by framing up the person who is currently in the King's good favor, conspiring to convince Henry that the plotted-against person is either, A, a failure, B, a traitor, or, C, a heretic. Someone is always trying to \\"purge\\" someone else's faction from court, and, yes, it does get old, kind of like a \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" movie that always begins with a certain number of teenagers, nearly all of which end up getting offed in creative ways. But I guess that's that old maxim, \\"History repeats...\\"<br /><br />But the whole impression of \\"The Tudors\\" contains more than that. There is a lot of cool s*** here: a huge peasant revolt that threatens to engulf the entire north of the country, there's a siege of a walled city in France, there are scheming Popes, corrupt Chancellors, and crises of conscience from the commons to the King. The torture scenes are grisly and horrifying, but they stop short of going completely f***ing nuts cannibal holocaust style. But yes, you will see gory severed heads on spikes, you will see horizon-reaching fields filled with gallows that bear hundreds of \\"heretics'\\" hanged corpses, and, on one particular occasion, a guy gets a red-hot poker rammed up his..... Well, you get the idea. Despite all of the courtly activities, imaginative entertainments, and opulence, this gets pretty violent, but it's nothing too over-the-top.<br /><br />Final note: I still don't understand why the Season Three graphic depicts Henry VIII enthroned on some weird \\"flesh-throne\\" comprised of nude people posing, which had nothing at all to do with the story, but whatever. \\"The Tudors\\" is nowhere close to being that extreme in any regard, but I do think it's a worthwhile and entertaining program, especially if period pieces or late medieval history are your thing.
1439138311|5.0|When Amazon readers react so differently to a novel, as they do here, something is going on, most likely in the novel. Most of the reviewers' negativity seems to be variations of `but nothing happens'. Well, let's see why that reaction might occur. Colm Toibin has created in Eilis an `average' Irish Catholic girl and traces her journey through perhaps the most difficult time of a person's life: the years from late adolescent into young adulthood. Toibin gives Eilis the added challenge  of living through that crucial period in the context of emigrating from Catholic rural Ireland to the urban melting pot of Brooklyn, then back again to Ireland.<br /><br />Instead of our  hero being outsized in emotional or physical or material resources, placed in unexpected situations (i.e.\\"something is happening to someone interesting\\") here we are shown how an ordinary person might react to the ordinary challenges (and tedium) of such a external and internal journey as well as to its few (but crucial) decision points. It is no small feat for a mature male writer to keep the narrative firmly focused on an \\"ordinary\\" young woman's responses to a life that presses, sometimes quite insistently, on her retiring, pre-feminist uncertainty. Never does the author intervene to  stand apart from or above Eilis's self-understanding, nor does his prose ever remind us of its skill. So does Toibin invisibly envelops the reader in Eilis's experience, much as she herself is.<br /><br />And indeed, isn't Eilis's life the sort of that most of us live? Life goes on, from day to day, in a routine way,even if it is a difficult one; then some obstacle or opportunity emerges which we face, like it or not, with our ordinary intelligence and ethical skills (or lack of them). Eilis seems in some ways, a female Willy Loman, but as a figure who may enjoy a happy life, as opposed to Miller's tragic Willy. She, like Willy, is ordinary--yet we care about her fate as if it were our own: what will she decide about Tony, about going home to Ireland, about returning the Brooklyn? These are the events that will define her life (and her ethical self) though she does not always recognize this (as we sometimes do not) and she, like us, does the best she can (which is none too good at some points and wonderfully courageous at others). She is, in a word, human-- and to create such an ordinary `heroine' is  a triumph of literary art.<br /><br />Novels surely serve many purposes; they can take us to other worlds, introduce us to fascinating people with the tragic passions of an Anna Karenina or the towering rage of Ahab. But occasionally, a novelist will present us with someone  with an more or less ordinary life...and make us see how extraordinary that life appears to the one who lives it through. Just as ours is to each of us.<br /><br />In regard to the last point, one major reservation There was a `deus ex machina' quality to the solution of Eilis's final choice: whether or not to return to Brooklyn. To make her development complete (and so the novel), she should have been allowed to make her own decision, rather than having it forced upon her by a somewhat unlikely chance event (though to be fair, life often seems to produce such accidents). Still, to become fully human seems to involve making ethical decisions through an act of the will. This , in the end, Eilis was not allowed to work out, and she and the novel are the poorer for it. Still, Brooklyn is a major work of art, whose issues, as several readers have noted,  remain for us to puzzle over long after we have finished this brief and beautiful story.oing home to Ireland, about returning the Brooklyn?

They continue to sit through the movie and walk out confused, irritated, slightly depressed and have a slight headache from the sound track and then go and tell all of their friends how smart, complex and stimulating the movie was.<br /><br />Don't fool your self into thinking this movie is something that it's not - this film is complete garbage.

1594202842|5.0|Amy Chua's Battle Hymn strikes a nerve - she nails the insecurity America feels about preparing our next generation. As a Chinese-American, she draws upon her immigrant parents' strict techniques to teach her two daughters persistence, self discipline, and fortitude. She drills them to be the best in everything - and they are! They grow into brilliant, happy, and graceful young women who teach their mother a thing or two. This is not a parenting guide, but an entertaining and heart-wrenching story of one amazing family's quest to raise children. And Chua succeeds, in every sense.     Professor Chua defines \\"Chinese Parenting\\" very broadly. As she states, this hardworking, perfectionist mentality can be found not only in other immigrant cultures but is indicative of America's Founding Fathers as well. Let's face it, we are a scrappy, hard working people who have sweated our way to the top of the globe. And our parents got us there. But now, as America's future dominance is in question, we may need someone like Chua to bring us back to our roots.     This book is refreshingly funny and cleverly written. Her writing is so accessible and entertaining that I could not put the book down! She and her family are amazingly successful but she exudes a classy humbleness that is very endearing.     Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is a must read. You will laugh, you will cry . . . or else I will burn all of your stuffed animals! Enjoy this excellent book!

0385737424|4.0|I gave this book as a gift to a 7th-grader whom I tutor in Washington, DC. I asked her to write a book review to help her practice her writing skills, but also to help other young readers decide whether they should read the book too. Her review appears below.     \\"My book is When You Reach Me by Rebecca Stead.  The main characters are Miranda, Sal and Marcus.  It took place in New York City.  This book is about Miranda getting mysterious notes about saving her friends and the writer of the notes life.  But when she gets the final note, she thinks she is too late.  My favorite character is Miranda because she is trying to save lives.    I thought the book was fascinating.  My favorite part of the book was when Miranda was discussing about the book A Wrinkle in Time.  I have two least favorite parts of the book.  First is when Sal got punched in the face by Marcus.  Second is when Miranda thought she was too late to save whoever's life.  If I could change something in the book it would be the part where Sal stopped being friends with Miranda.    I would recommend this book to pre-teens and teens, because the book involves kids around that particular age.\\"

It is true that this is more of a \\"field guide\\" but at the ame time it could easily be used for somebody who is simply interested in reading about the subject. I am strongly interested in this subject and am considering going into it when I start college. I was tired of reading osteology books that are created solely for the public. They don't go deep into the subject and you can't learn about the things the things that you would learn if youwere taking an actual class.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to not only people who want to use it for school but also for citizens who want to deeply learn about human osteology.<br /><br />I also want to mention the nice spine. It lies flat ona desk or table which is really nice. The water resistant cover is also a plus because it not only protects against water but you can wash off any stains or smudges(without ruining it) you get from laying the book on a lead covered desk or a food filled backback.<br /><br />BTW: If your going to read this book as a non-student of this field I suggest you print out a picture of labled skeleton because it is helpful to know the bones they are talking about! lol.

B002ZG993Q|5.0|Those who complain about this movie wouldn't like the original Day of the Jackal for the same reason: because it moves too slowly. The pacing in US movies has changed dramatically in the last 30-40 years. I can still watch a foreign movie, which this essentially is, and breathe.    The \\"thrill\\" of this story is watching what happens in Clooney's head. One other reviewer referred to moral crisis. It is. You can argue well it's a bit late, but forced into killing a woman he cared for could have that effect on even a stonehearted man.    It's slow. So what. The head and the heart work slowly, as does healing. It's a tragedy. Like Lear, he gains knowledge but too late.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book started like a good novel (searching for \\"Caballo Blanco\\" - a mythic, maybe non-existent runner. The Tarahumara indians - did they really exist? Are they really the world's greatest distance runners?<br />Then, I was surprised. The author mentioned his own running problems - the injuries, how he tried to fix them.  As McDougall mentioned the doctors' names, I concluded - this must be real!<br /><br />Then, I was amazed. Reading this nice book, I found many well-known names form the world of running - Joe Vigil, Scott Jurek, known Races (Badwater) and a lot of fun.<br /><br />I learned why younger athletes can lose against much older runners. I learned also why the humans are born to run and not to walk and how running helped Homo sapiens surviving while the Neanderthal men disappeared.<br /><br />Finally, I enjoyed reading about the epic race between the runners representing the Western world (Scott Jurek, author himself and some others) and the Tarahumara Indians, the race where friendship and mutual helping won over the cheating and battle for positions.<br /><br />This books seems like a fiction, is better than some running novels I read (\\"Again to Carthage\\"), certainly not worse than a legendary, but fictional, \\"Once A Runner\\" - and, however, this is not a novel.<br /><br />McDougall's style is fluid and funny, but well documented and very detailed. He mentions some different points of view (barefoot running vs. running in shoes), some philosophy (\\"think easy, light and smooth\\" while running, as \\"Caballo\\" said). And he also mentions how he fixed his running injuries.<br /><br />Intense, interesting and amazing book I'll re-read soon, although I just finished reading it!
B000JIHP88|4.0|We wanted a mobile that had bright popping color, which was harder to find than we first imagined it would be. The Fisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile fit the bill and included some features we really find noteworthy.<br /><br />As this mobile rotates, the leaves flap up and down like wings on a bird. As the fauna spins underneath, the leaves drop down in the gap between each character, lifting back up and out of the way as the next animal approaches. This really seems to grab our 2 month old's attention and I consider it the mobile's most unique feature.<br /><br />The remote is handy for undisturbed restarts, allowing us to reset the music when it times out if she is still awake.<br /><br />The music is nice and plays at a very appropriate volume just as noted by many other reviewers. While my wife and I prefer the Baby Einstein product lines take on some of the classical composers, our baby seems to be soothed to sleep by the Fisher Price interpretations just fine. This was the one reason we gave the mobile 4 stars instead of 5. As far as functionality and effectiveness we are very pleased, just would have preferred slightly different musical choices.<br /><br />The unit attached to our crib without issue and assembly was straight forward and completed quickly.
B0033AI41G|5.0|First let's get this out of the way up front; THIS isn't the biography A BEAUTIFUL MIND which focuses on John Nash's genius as well as his flaws. This, instead, focuses on Nash's battle with mental illness. When a director makes a film they have to choose a path to tell a story--unlike a book it's extremely difficult to take a story like Nash's and condense it into a two hour narrative. Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Avika Goldsman chose the most clear pathway (and using a literary device called \\"the unreliable narrator)--Nash's brilliance in mathematics AND his slide into mental illness.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release from Universal features an exceptional looking high def transfer. Colors are nicely captured. The Blu-ray captures Roger Deakins' photography with good detail and textures.The transfer exhibits the changing color scheme and textures as John Nash becomes increasingly paranoid. Image detail/sharpness is a tad inconsistent but I suspect that has more to do with the intent of the director and Deakins' decisions in how the scenes are photographed. Edge enhancement crops up quite a bit which is distracting but it isn't the worst I've seen in some films.<br /><br />There isn't anything new that I noticed in the special features but it does appear as if almost all of  the extras have been ported over from the regular DVD edition. The only thing I detected as missing were the clips from the Academy Awards. The two commentary tracks are in tact as well featuring director Ron Howard and writer Avika Goldsman. Unfortunately, all of the extras are presented in standard definition.<br /><br />What's clever and works really well in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is the WAY that Howard and Goldsman have decided to tell the story; they make us identify with shy, charismatic John Nash, realize how brilliant he is, see his experience at the University from HIS perspective. Howard and Goldsman then turn our expectations on its head by demonstrating that much of what WE experienced with Nash may or may not be real and that he suffers from schizophrenia. We discover that a lot of what Nash \\"knows\\" to be true isn't at all and that he lives in a world of shadows suggesting reality but often never touching on it.<br /><br />There was plenty of criticism about the fact that \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" wasn't faithful to the book of the same name and played down Nash's bisexuality, racism and other personal issues. As fascinating as Nash's life is, the film fictionalizes Nash's experience and focuses on his unexpected journey into madness pulling us, the audience, into the rabbit hole with Nash. It's a clever conceit and one that works well allowing us to both understand Nash, sympathize with him enough so that WE feel like we are sliding down into the same madness that has consumed him.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is an extremely good upgrade picture wise for \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". The film doesn't have a perfect presentation and there are some flaws (such as edge enhancement)but, on the whole, it looks exceptionally good.t be real and that he suffers from schizophrenia.

0688014291|4.0|This is another parable book by Spencer Johnson.  I still think \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" is the better of the books as far as delivering the message and getting you to think.<br /><br />The message here is to \\"train\\" your workers to effectively complete their tasks/goals by using one minute goal setting, and one minute praise and reprimands.  The author argues that this method is more effective than simply hiring someone, giving them a job description, and then giving them an annual review. He uses an analogy of a bowler bowling a strike. The bowler feels accomplishment when he sees how many pins he has hit right away. The feedback is immediate and it is obvious.  If the bowler bowls but an imaginary paper is blocking his view of the pins and all he hears is the strike, then how does he know what just happened; did he do well or do poorly? In the same way, if you don't let your workers know they are doing a good job or even doing a bad job and you just evaluate them once a year, they will show about the same enthusiasm as the bowler who \\"bowls in the dark.\\"<br /><br />If you are a good manager or a good boss, I would hope you are already actively monitoring and praising your workers progress.  I think if you are a go-getter, you probably already manage this way because you care about the people working for you and the work at hand.  I had a supervisor one time when I was at my first job and he used a similar style of managing and things always got done. I felt comfortable around him and work was fun.  I had another supervisor in another department that didn't have a clue what was going on. Some people were working, some were slacking and some things just would not seem to get done; the department was inefficient and it was a mess.<br /><br />The goal of the one minute manager is to make sure everybody clearly knows what needs to be done, and when something isn't getting done, you need to offer immediate feedback by reprimanding them. When things are getting done, you need to also offer feedback in the form of praise/encouragement.  The key to all of this is to let your workers know beforehand that this is how you manage.<br /><br />I only paid a buck for this book so obviously I feel that I got my money's worth.  I don't think it's worth the full price considering the message is rather on the basic and somewhat obvious side.  I still think it's worth a read. There is no A-ha! moment here, but this advice certainly can benefit you not only at work but also in other relationships.ck in the form of praise/encouragement.

1401219268|5.0|What if superheroes were real? I mean really \\"real\\": what if they grew old and got fat, had spouses and families, carried emotional baggage (sometimes a serious psychosis), and just generally had to deal with everyday life? These super-heroes aren't inherently all good, either. Just like public servants -- police, politicians, doctors, etc. -- many begin with the best intentions, but some become jaded and others are only motivated by self-interest from the start. In other words, if superheroes were real, they would be just like us, more or less.<br /><br />Also, what would an ultra-powerful superhero really be like? A person who understands quantum theory as easily as we chew gum, and is so powerful that he can move through the space-time continuum, be several places at once, and alter sub-atomic structure with a mere thought? Can you imagine how scary it would be for a god to live among us? Someone whose very citizenship in a particular country gives that country an unbeatable advantage over the rest of the world?<br /><br />On the surface, this is the premise for Watchmen, and Watchmen was the first work of its kind to humanize superheroes this way, but it's also much more. There are good reasons this graphic novel, or comic book for adults, won a Hugo and was picked by Time magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels since 1923. (To any literary snobs out there who've talked trash about comics and the like: In your face, Dude!)<br /><br />Alan Moore made superheroes into real-life people. Then he put these heroes in a paranoid world on the brink of a nuclear holocaust, a world where a symbolic clock that tracks doomsday as 12:00 is currently ticking down to the last few precious minutes. Does that world sound familiar? It should. It was Earth circa 1980's.<br /><br />This reviewer recalls those times all too well, as I imagine most anyone who lived through the Cold War can. I was mostly just a kid then, but it still seemed inevitable that sooner or later the USA and U.S.S.R would have at each other and the world be damned. In fact, I was in the Army at the time the Watchmen comic was running, in `86 thru `87 (which is probably why I missed it then) and we were training with the Soviets in mind as our enemy. So I found Watchmen to be pretty much... terrifying.<br /><br />Mr. Moore's insight into modern society and how fragile our world is, unfortunately, rings all too true. It's enough to keep you awake at night. There are probably one or two people left that haven't read Watchmen or seen the movie yet so I won't give away spoilers, but if you take into account the time Watchmen was written and what came to pass years later, it's even a little prophetic.<br /><br />In a graphic novel, the illustrations tell as much, if not more, of the story than the words. So it's crucial that the artist realize the writer's vision and be inspired by it enough to bring the action and emotion to life. When the writer and illustrator are a perfect match, a graphic novel or comic book becomes a thing of magic. Moore and Dave Gibbon accomplished this with Watchmen.<br /><br />Even more than the actual imagery, the coloring and shading make this story jump out of the book. Flashes from lightning or explosions almost made me blink. I could practically feel the dampness of a rain-slick street. A horrifying facial expression of a character so angry that he's about to explode with violence all but makes the reader instinctively prepare to flee. Don't overlook the smallest details of each panel. They will be meaningful later.<br /><br />I have enjoyed a few other graphic novels more than I did Watchmen. But nothing I've ever read has been as frightening as the decision the characters face at the conclusion. It's the kind of decision that, if it really happened, we wouldn't want to know about. And I've never read anything that realizes life's place in the grand scheme of the universe like Watchmen does.<br /><br />I'm amazed that comics, the very medium that introduced me into the fascinating world of books, turned out to be the medium that produced the most profound book I've ever read.

0439023513|4.0|Spoilers to follow, because I'm not sure *anyone* can review this without giving it away.  If you want to know if it's worth buying the answer is yes, go buy it.  But I will caution you, unlike the other two this one is an interesting mix of delightful storytelling and inexcusable vagueness that leaves readers angry and bewildered.     When I first began Hunger Games I knew what the ending of Mockingjay had to be- Collins bludgeons us (adults I should add, I don't know if it is too subtle for junior highers to pick up on or not) with the comparison of Panem to ancient Rome.  The gladiator arena becomes the hunger games, the dispassionate cruel Emperor becomes the president, the vomitoriums become the party scene in Catching Fire, the Romans wearing wigs made of blond womens scalps becomes the desire to genetically modify yourself and keep pace with ever changing fashions.  Sometimes Collins does a straight copy, as in the alarming number of slaves kept, the fact that they had their tongues cut out so as not to spread secrets, the technological superiority of the oppressors. It's this that makes the series so right and real- because she lifted it right out of history the story is believable and engrossing. However, knowing that Panem's fate is essentially Romes, and knowing that Rome devolved into civil war before the barbarians invaded and destroyed it, you can easily predict that vault 13 is going to invade and destroy the Capital. The only question is did Collins pull it off? Only for the most part.     I'll start with what this book does right.      It scales right. The first hunger games was about a scared but determined girl protecting her family, trying to survive in a bloody arena.  The second was about an inward and much larger open rebellion, where the arena was no longer a bloodbath of the territories against one another, but the combatants against the Empire. The third was about the war itself being symbolic of the arena, that the arena is now the Capitolcity, the combatants the soldiers. Mockingjay is set on a much grander stage, it was a bigger reward and a bigger risk for Collins to do this, but I think she pulls it off admirably.     It's true to life, and interesting.  Collins asks us to think of what a battered society such as 13 would evolve into, a minimalist dictatorial society that does only what it can to survive.  No frills, no colors, no fancy meals, no music, no real independent thought, for there is no time for it.  This is an excellent bit of fiction that is really only hinted at, but done well enough that your mind can easily picture the backstory of the place, as easily as you can life in the other districts.  Collins also hints well that the Capitol with all their biological wonders was battering 13 with engineered viruses, and that 13 needed DNA scans to prevent clones or creatures from getting to sensitive materials.      The love triangle.  Gail comes to represent the voice of 13 while Peeta the voice of the new world. Gail the voice of perpetual war and hunger games, Peeta the voice of life and enough bread to never hunger again.  War vs peace. It's pretty obvious early on who she's going to end up with for this reason, but Collins did it right, starting with a lot of Gail and ending with a lot of Peeta.    It ends well.  Starting at the exile, minus the epilogue which detracted from it somewhat.    Now what it does wrong.  It leaves too many plot gaps.  There is no reason why the Capitol should not have satellites, clone armies, or more advanced weaponry.  It's true that Snow saw the whole thing as a game but when push came to shove he should have broken out with a real show of force, if they can clone up an army of lizard men to hunt down Katness and can cloak their hovercraft there should be no end to their might. The humming bow, and the Triton that cames back when called were just plain silly.    It drops the characters.  There was no excuse for Finnick dying as he did, Collins just quits the scene and moves on.  Gale fell out from a decent chap to a pure villain rather fast and without much explanation.  Beetee is some sort of unbelievable Einstein level genius that we leave behind without a good send off.  Worst of all is Kat herself, during the initial part of the book she is weak, during the middle strong, toward the end weak, and then finishes off strong.  This is not what a character does unless a good explanation is served, ala Mr. Peeta Bread's brainwashing.    It rushes the ending, and unlike the others, this one is inexcusable. During the sewer chase scene the writing comes down a full notch and you can no longer blaze through it like you did the rest of the series; careful attention must be paid the entire remainder of the book.  Previously Collins would explain the plot twists and describe the motivations going into the dilemmas, but here she just shoves them at you to make of it what you will.  I'm certain that she fleshed out her outline and it didn't get a good editing job before publication. The ending was pretty obvious to me, but I doubt most people got it so well, and it's a kids book, so that's really unacceptable.   What happened:  President Coin knew Peeta had failed to kill Kat, which meant her chief political opponent would still be around at the wars end, so she sets about to finish off Kat in a different way: by dropping Prim into a trap. This has the desired consequent, with Prim dead Kat becomes broken, living only for revenge, for everything she did up until that point was ruined.  Every action done to protect Prim was now in vain.  Kat realizes that Coin is more evil than Snow ever was, for all Snow wanted was amusement and stability, if he could get it through threats and a little starvation then that was enough, but Coin wanted power, and that had no limit to it, which meant Katniss could protect Prim from the Snow, but not from Coin, and after her visit with Snow she is forced to faith the truth of this. Coin then calls a meeting of all the remaining victors for the sole purpose of making them politically unelectable, once seen as vengeful monsters nobody would want the victors to lead the new republic, and thus Coin would be unopposed. Kat senses this, and to put Coin off her guard votes 'yes' to throw away her political future.  The bond between Heimich and Kat now goes the other way, and he intuits her hint and trusts her, thus completing the circle from book one.  Coin underestimates Kat who knows just how evil she is, and dies for it when Katniss arrows her.     Unable to live now that she has had her revenge and Prim is dead Kat gives up, but finds she is still too strong to kill herself, which means she is doomed to live in a purgatory of suffering, of endless nightmares with nothing to go on for but unable to die.  Peeta meanwhile has healed fully, examines who he knows Kat to be as an adult and decides to love her. Unlike Gail who rides off, he is the knight on the white horse, he seeks her out, pursues her, and holds her like he did on the public relations tour until she comes back to life.  Now our little coal heroine, formerly burned out begins to warm up again,  begins to come back to life.    Katniss then spends her life healing and raising a family under a decent ruler of the republic.    So there it is, I'd say a five star book with a one star deduction for a terrible rush job ending, even if it was the right story and right ending- realistic, yet hopeful. It's a classic story with a postmodern bend to it.  If you have ever met a Katniss and Peeta in real life (my Grandmother was severely abused growing up, my Grandfather loved her unconditionally) you know it ends well. Even if Collins only points her readers in that direction.

0783225733|5.0|Ron Howard doesn't make crap. All his stuff is good and this is no exception. Suspenseful, entertaining and a happy ending. It's hard to ask more from a movie.

B002VHI8FE|4.0|Joe Abercrombie's debut novel, \\"The Blade Itself\\", doesn't come off as very different from fantasy works that came before it, at least not at first. It starts off with a hint that it might be more violent than most fantasy, but before long it seems to settle into the old familiar tropes.  As the first volume in a trilogy, most of the book is spent introducing characters and beginning their journeys, planting seeds that will bear fruit later on in the series. Readers are introduced to the rogue's gallery of major characters that will dominate the story for the next two books, and while most fit neatly into archetypes when introduced, they begin to change and evolve almost immediately.<br /><br />\\"The Blade Itself\\" is solid fantasy, but it is really just the foundation for the events that will follow, and as such is more of a primer on the world Abercrombie has built and the characters the reader will follow. He has his own flair here, but it's following works that show what makes Abercrombie so special. So get started here, and if you like it at all, keep going. What starts off as somewhat unique fantasy is going to get much better. As a standalone work, \\"The Blade Itself\\" is solid, but rightfully reviewed as the first part of a trilogy, it does a fantastic job of bringing the reader along without confusing them, all while preparing them for the journey ahead. Abercrombie's style of prose is solid if unspectacular, though his flair for dialog and black humor shines throughout.<br /><br />Of note is that the Kindle version, like the following volumes, suffers from some formatting problems. Each new paragraph is broken up by a double space, which causes scene shifts to sneak up on and confuse the reader. I've notified the publisher and they are looking into this, but it does not appear to have been updated yet.

B003EYVXSW|2.0|My spouse and I watched this one the other night and then immediately regretted it. We only kept viewing it till the end to make sure that it had so few redeeming qualities. We had high hopes that we'd be seeing something akin to Aliens or just a fairly original and suspenseful sci-fi flick. It would have been okay if it had just been mildly entertaining. Instead we viewed what seemed to be a nearly incoherent movie - and actually it was incoherent in parts - as well as at least one character who disappeared at the last moment, with no explanation.<br /><br />The sex scenes? My spouse and I both felt disgusted by those and we aren't uptight about sex scenes in movies. These were just pitiful, violent and made no sense. Were they just thrown in there in hopes of attracting some extra suspense or attention? If so, the attention was the wrong kind. I felt sorry for the actors in this film. Now watch...this will go on to be one of those movies which is so bad it becomes camp. I pray that doesn't happen. It doesn't deserve even that honor.<br /><br />I'd really like to read the script for this one. It is hard to believe that anyone signed up for this film in its final version. Perhaps they changed the script as the movie was being shot. If you are looking for entertainment, suspense, decent characters, and a sci-fi thriller, look elsewhere. If you are trying to watch a film to help you go to sleep, this might be a good choice. Barely watchable.

0440133688|5.0|This is a classic.  I first read this when I got out of grad school in the early 70's.  It was given to my by some friends who were just getting out of med school in Boston.  I loved it then and I love it now.  Want to know some of the adventures and lack of knowing what is really going on most docs experience during their first year, two or three after medical school?  then read this:  written by the real thing; a young doc just finishing his internship.  My PCP is a younger guy and had not had the opportunity to read the book.  I purchased it mostly for him,  for entertainment, levity, and to help him reminisce his younger years a a beginning physician.<br /><br />If you enjoy some of the inside scoop of things and you can take things lightly, then this may be your kind of fun reading over a weekend.
0810970686|4.0|Jeff Kinney does a fantastic job of relating the trials and tribulations of Greg Heffley again in this hysterical book.  Greg comes to us this time in either the 6th or 7th grade (I can never tell) and lets us know about his life from Christmas until he is out of school for the summer.  From not getting anything that he wants for Christmas, not washing any of his clothes for a semester, to worring about if his dad is going to send him away to military school during his summer break, Greg lets us into his world.  This is definately a boy's world.  Video games, boy scouts, camping trips, and underwear humor are all included in this short novel.  I would recommend this book for any boy ages 7 to 12.  It is quite an easy read for this age group. In fact I would definately recommend any of the books in this series.  The books themselves are written in such a way that they engage the reader form the get-go.  Mr. Kinney makes these books fun.  It's a definate win for students who might have some trouble reading, because it is such an easy read.  This type of book is also nice for the reader who reads quickly. It will keep them entertained & occupied. Enjoy!
B00447G2PM|5.0|I bought this 3D BLU RAY so I could test the abilities of my Samsung 3D plasma TV and the Samsung 3D Blu Ray player. I am not a kid anymore. i have plenty of tech. I am easily bored. I really didn't expect what i got...<br /><br />All I can say is....WOW!!!!!! This movie blew my mind. its freaky how you get sucked into the picture. The little fish swimming right by your nose. i actually had to fight the urge to hold my breath. you really feel loike u are underwater! There were times I reached out and tried to touch the jellyfish that seemed like they were inches from my face. I felt like i was a 10 year old going on a deep sea dive. This format is the most fun I have had in a long time with tech. Its like visiting another world!<br /><br />I cant wait to see what they start making next. its too bad they really haven't released alot of new titles yet. this tech is supposed to only get better though. Not all 3D movies are created equal. Make sure you rad the reviews and if you can, try and watch a preview at Best Buy or whatever. This is a short film,, butI have already sat through it 3 times and will be doing it again tonight.3d is definitely the way.

B00275EHJQ|5.0|In Toy Story 3 (2010) Andy, the toys' owner, has grown-up and is going off to college. His mother tells him to decide what he wants to do with his toys, whether they should be donated, put up in the attic, or tossed out. What will become of the toys who need affection, but who never age but can get broken or worn out? The only one he has decided to take with him to college is Woody, the cowboy, who is a replica of a television puppet series character. Through a mix-up, the mother puts out with the rubbish a bag of toys meant for the attic. Luckily the toys escape from the jaws of the trash truck, but they blame Andy for throwing them out. They climb into a box meant for donation to a pre-school nursery.<br />The toys are donated to Sunnyside Daycare. The boss of the toys there (a villain) is teddy-bear Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty). He makes sure that Andy's toys go in the room where a bunch of unruly kids are very rough on the toys and hurl them around. Woody helps to rescue them from this place of horrors. Buzz Lightyear is a featured toy. A new toy is introduced, Ken (voice of Michael Keaton), of the Barbie family, and he and Barbie click. Later there are some heart-stopping moments in the dump when you fear that the toys are going to end up in the jaws of the trash crusher.<br />The tradition of high quality in this series is maintained in this which may be the last in the series. It is one of the best of the animated series ever made. It makes this gang of toys almost into real people with each of the toy characters having an individualized personality. Audiences get emotionally involved; they care about these toys as they would about people. The toys become a family and are interdependent. That is the magic of the films' creators. The voices of Tom Hanks and of the other major stars help to delineate these toy characters. And let's remember there's a lot of comedy in this enterprise.<br />It's a highly imaginative, funny, and emotionally gripping story for adults as well as kids. It's an interesting ironic situation: the human beings are robotic and stagy: the toys are more human than the human beings. These movie are high points in the evolution of animated films.s kids.

B001FB4VXU|4.0|This show has some unique takes on the dumb and smart among us, and shows it / the differences without being preachy or biased.  A nice look into how \\"the others\\" may sometimes see us, be we the dumb or smart ones.  Some original laughs without dimwitted setups or drivel.  A nice show that is easy to watch and enjoy.  I especially enjoy some of the characteristics that surface.
B004IM14RY|3.0|I was really torn, I love Ryan Reynolds so I knew I would see it, but what I feared was true... I became very bored with being inside a coffin for 1.5 hours. I think the story was great, but I think if this was condensed into a 30 minute short story this would have been a 5-star. I couldn't sit through it again, but I am glad I saw it.
B0043GXYBO|2.0|This book had a good story line, however, it had very adult language.  It was hard to find a page where the author was not swearing or referring to oral sex.  I like to read \\"teen\\" books such as Twilight, Hungar Games, Harry Potter, etc. because i dont like to read smut.  This is smut.  The authors try very hard to sound like teenagers but they just come across as trying way to hard!  I will not be reading the rest of this series, not because of the story, but because of the way it is written.

0316069485|5.0|This is a great book.  Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller are my favorite characters and having them interact more in this book then any previous was great.  It also lended quite a bit of character development to some of the previously more minor characters, such as Maggie McPherson and the daughters of both Bosch and Haller.  Was an unexpected ending, but a great read, I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommended!

B004B32500|5.0|This was my first Alejandro Jodorowsky film.  A friend of mine from Texas introduced me to this film.  I had never heard of Alejandro (this was back when El Topo was in hiding due to rights issues, which have been resolved thankfully), but this film made me take notice, and it's quite extraordinary.  The film was out on VHS and laserdisc, but the transfers weren't the greatest and there were no bonus features.  Now the film has been released in a proper, region 1 DVD.  I was always surprised that ABCKO, the company that released the Jodorowsky box set, didn't include this film with those, as it is as fascinating and as artistic as those films were.  No matter.  It's here now.<br /><br />Santa Sangre is a little more straightfoward than Jodorowsky's better known films, but that doesn't mean it's a mainstream film.  It's like saying Lynch's Mulholland Drive is a little more accesible than Eraserhead, yet they are both masterful films.  Santa Sangre doesn't have the overall hallucinatory vibe that El Topo and The Holy Mountain have, but it's still a masterful film, and it's an endlessly fascinating film. There are many amazing scenes (one where an elephant's carcass is dumped over a cliff to hungry villagers is the most extraordinary scene here) sprinkled throughout the film.  Alejandro hadn't directed a film in 14 years (the last one before this was a film called Tusk which he disowned), but the time off didn't make him lose his creativity. Rarely can a filmmaker take so many years off and come back with a great film like this (Malick, Leone, Dreyer, and Kubrick have done it as well).<br /><br />Santa Sangre is garish, disturbing, funny (darkly so), mystical, and overall, an Alejandro Jodorowsky film.  Jodorowsky has only made six features, with his last one made in 1990 (The Rainbow Thief, which isn't very good though not terrible).  I don't know if he'll ever make another movie (he's in his 80's, though many great directors continue into their later years making films), but his filmography, even at only six movies, is masterful.filmography, even at only six movies, is masterful.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I got this because it's a Steve Jackson Games product. I used to joke with my friends that we should call our weekly game night Steve Jackson Games night. The entire game is self contained in a durable rolling cup. It's also extremely easy to pick up. No arguing about the rules for hours. Just open, shake, and play.
0452286751|2.0|When I read this book, it was due to piqued interest and the same contest another reviewer put it in. At first it was somewhat enjoyable, but by the end, it was an irritation. I did not like it for a variety of reasons.     1. The characters were cardboard cut-outs of human beings put up to make a simplistic plot in the guise of complexity and depth seem interesting. Howard Roark was needlessly irritating, unlike L'etranger, where the detachment and utter nihilism of the character is interesting, in the context of this book it is just pointless. I was rooting for him to compromise. I am aware that these characters are ideals, but Ideals can have more than one character trait, you just have to put more emphasis on one trait.    2. the dialog, this dialog is hard to describe. Most of it is repeated versions of the same phrase and almost always contradictory points on the same thing. I can't even remember it, But I remember the frustration of reading constantly contradictory remarks and the subjects not even reacting to the utter stupidity of it.    3. The subject matter. I didn't find it interesting, at all, I know to each his.her own can be applied here, and for me it didn't work    4. Finally, the philosophy, goodness gracious, It's ok to have philosophical tid bits, but to dedicate 30 pages to one speech about why it's good to be selfish is just the most annoying thing ever. Sure, having a philosophy is fine, sure you can be vocal about it. But at what point does it move from philosophical to proselytizing? I'd say Rand walks that thing line very loosely and I'm not a fan. Not to mention her Philosophy being very shallow    So these are my thoughts on the work. To those who like the work and feel I am a troll, feel free to call me one, I will not say your opinion is wrong simply because I didn't like the work. There is no such thing as an Objective opinion (no pun intended)and I can't claim there is. Feel free to bash my grammar, I know it is terrible and despite my writer aspirations it is something I am still awful at. If you read this, I hope I wasn't harsh to the point of being unreasonable. In defense of the book it was easy to read and had a relatively streamlined plot, but these glaring problems made it hard for me to enjoy this.    Si Vales Valeo
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love watching movies that are gladiator-Roman-gods themed.  I was a little leary about ordering a movie I never heard of and hated the thoughts of buying it and then finding out it was a big waste of my money. I could go on and on about how great this movie is, bottom line a very good movie that caught my attention from the start, intrigued me and had several underlying stories.  I know I will be adding season 2 to my library.  Thumbs up for me!
B001TODCII|5.0|Just wondering, but how many of the people who say this movie is \\"not realistic\\", on the Left, thought Avatar was really good, or \\"Che\\", or let's say, \\"Blood Diamond\\" or \\"The Bourne Identity\\" ?    This movie is taught and tight, and Liam Neeson is, as always, excellent. I really liked the martial arts. I have been studying martial arts for years, and have recently been reading a book called \\"The Dirty Dozen\\", by a Green Beret/Special Forces guy. I can tell you, the MA in this movie is very realistic and is exactly what the U.S. special forces uses.     I think that the older you are and the more conservative in your overall worldview, the more you would like this movie. I loved it. Nice to see a movie not corrupted by the typical leftwing Hollywood agendas.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|Very Happy with the DVD's. Packaging came damaged and will have to purchase the case for the DVD's. Of course, you buy the DVD's and not the packaging. Great series.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|Facebook probably isn't going away anytime soon, but I expect this movie only be a flash in the pan. Definitely doesn't merit a second viewing. After all it's just a fictionalized account of the beginnings of Facebook, hitting the screens when the critical mass of American society (72% of online users) has recently embraced the novelty of this social medium. The script is well written. Snappy dialogue refers to the inspiration & development of Facebook features, capitalizing on the affinity with viewers when they experienced those features themselves for the first time. That's the high point. . . quite thrilling. The acting, settings and cinematography are about as interesting as Masterpiece Theatre.
B002OHB3CG|4.0|After casually tossing off a couple of great symphonic rock albums (The Silent Force and The Heart of Everything) Within Temptation then owned the place with The Black Symphony. A spectacle of rare quality which, as the saying goes, was `bigger than Ben Hur'. Quite literally in some respects given that the video screen that backed the stage for that gig WAS in fact the largest ever used in Europe up to that time. So just how do you top such a stupendous example of musical shock and awe? Easy - you don't try. Within Temptation have here chosen to go in many ways into the opposite direction of bombast and excess by releasing a CD of recordings of acoustic versions of some of their symph rock classics.<br /><br />And what are the results? Well pretty darn good all told. Sharon Den Adel sounds in fine voice here, her tone almost reedy somehow and piercingly fragile at times. The band - almost by definition in such a release - are somewhat to the rear on this CD though the overal instrumetation is bolstered by the presence of a string quartet. And it must be pointed out that sometimes the band does plug in those amps to create semi-acoustic presentations of some of the numbers.<br /><br />Overall this CD works in allowing the listener to hear a different format of songs they probably already know in a way that works - always something to be aware of when bands try to do something different with songs their fans already love. The inclusion of some of the same guests from The Black Symphony set (Keith Caputo & Anneke Van Giersbergen) helps in a way to create a feeling of continuity with their recent past and adds variety to the vocal chores - I mean Sharon has a great voice but too much of even a good thing can be a problem at times too huh?<br /><br />Taken in isolation this tastefully produced release is a fun album and perfect for when you want to play something in mixed company or when you don't want to crank something that will kill your goldfish. And topped off with the bonus new track of Utopia featuring Chris Jones - a track totally in keeping with the rest of the albums mellow remit it must be said. Taken in the context of their overall career this is a nice hiatus, you get the sense of a band taking a breath and taking stock. And taken in both contexts this CD is one any fan of Within Temptation will want in their collection.topia featuring Chris Jones - a track totally in keeping with the rest of the albums mellow remit it must be said.

B004EVRM7K|1.0|It is absolutely ridiculous to create Blu-ray 3d \\"exclusive\\" tie ups like Avatar when expecting people to pay a premium to be early adapters knowing full well that prices will come down dramatically over time.

0307454541|5.0|Very few authors can make you feel so in sync with the characters and action that get lost in the pages and end up reading for hours on end without realizing it.  I made the mistake of starting this book at about 7 pm one evening and was miserable all the next day because I stayed up most of the night to finish it.<br />The story is completely new and different with plot twists you never see coming.  By the end of the book I was in open mouthed shock when the mystery is finally revealed.  There is suspense, good old fashioned sleuthing, political intrigue and hard core crime all woven together in this first of a trilogy.  Lisbeth Salander, the social outcast with a genius for computers and a photographic memory, is one of the most original characters to come along in years.  I can't wait to sink my teeth into the next book, \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" but I think I'll start it on the weekend when I can afford to lose a little sleep.

B000067QMD|5.0|We limped along without these sealing lids for so long until I saw them on Amazon. It allowed us to prepare bottles ahead of time as I felt more comfortable using these for sealing instead of the normal Avent nipple/cap combo. It was also nice to throw a few sealed bottles into the diaper bag and then just pop the disc out and swap with a nipple when we were ready to feed the baby. They take up so much less room in the fridge or diaper bag compared to having a nipple on the bottles. We never had any leaks or other issue. I am just glad to have found them.
B000YDOOUK|4.0|Caught these boys supporting Motorhead in Newcastle, Australia. And the comparisons were somewhat obvious - both bands plying their trade in simple rawk rock in numbers pumped out with conviction and a deep love of rock `n' roll spirit (and spirits).<br /><br />Touted by some as the 2nd coming of AC/DC Airbourne is in fact probably about the 7th or 8th coming of the aforesaid Akka Dakka but their tales of debauchery, drinking, fighting, debauchery, some more drinking and then some debauchery to finish the evening off are everything this form of music is supposed to be. Simple. Loud. Blasted at the listener with ridiculous levels of abandon that would be unseemly on anyone over 30. And there are times when every rivet headed guy feels the need to listen to exactly that sort of thing. When working out on your punching bag. When blasting down the highway. When you've got a couple of mates over for a drinking session. All of the eleven tracks here are designed to be listened to at volume and with a beer in at least one hand and all make a beeline for that raucous pub rock that just strikes a nerve in a certain percentage of the population.<br /><br />Musically this is pretty simple fare and the alcohol stained vox slot in perfectly with the remit of the band - everything louder than everything else and nary a ballad in sight. Lyrically the band stay pretty much on cue with just about every song covering the five major food groups of women, drinking, women, fighting and women (noticing a theme in this review yet?). It all works a treat in a wonderfully brain cell negating way and it's the bands ability to hone down their songs, to reduce them to their core reason to be that saw this debut from the little band that could from Australia cause such a stir both domestically and abroad.<br /><br />A wonderful album to just throw on when in the correct mood. At other times it may just be too simplistic or one dimensional. But that's OK because, I mean, you do own other albums right?
030746363X|1.0|I have read a lot of diet books but this has to be the biggest waste of time & money ever! This \\"author\\" is so far out there that this book cannot be applied to any normal human. It's full of staticstics that don't mean anything to the average person & prescribes a routine that is complicated, costly & unreal in it's application. I've never seen anything so convoluted in my life & did not gain anything helpful by buying this book.
B0034G4P7Q|1.0|This movie kind of reminded me of the movie Burn After Reading.. a movie which laid intensely dramatic music over comically absurd drama to achieve a nice blend of satire.  In The Social Network there was dramatic music and an emphasis on establishing just how seriously this movie was taking itself, but there was no satire to be found.  No drama either.  Jesse Eisenberg, like Michael Cera, is mostly the same in every movie and The Social Network is no different.  Admittedly sharp line delivery, but through a perpetually soulless monotone and painfully awkward demeanor.  Hardly anything you'd call \\"acting\\".  Lay that all onto a character who is nothing more than a 1-note jerk for two hours and you're left with a main character you don't like, don't respect, and don't care about because in most cases, you already know how the story ends:  A nerdy narcissistic jerk begins the world's biggest website using other peoples ideas and becomes a billionaire in the process.  People along the way get mad and sue him.  There.  I just saved you a couple hours.  Justin Timberlake's character could've been played by anyone.  Andrew Garfield is really the only highlight of the film as he's the only character that has anything resembling.. well, character.  Depth.  He's the ONLY thing in this movie with any depth that could illicit any kind of emotional response.  The rest of it, like Facebook, is mostly comprised of fake drama being passed off as real drama taking itself way too seriously.   I like true stories.  I like thrillers and dramas and smart wordy flicks that make you think and tell a good story.  The Social Network was an excercise in how to attempt to do all of that and fail.  Zero entertainment value.  Zero.
B002ZG999U|1.0|The Expendables is a moronic love letter to 1980s action movies, most of which weren't that great in the first place. While the '80s did produce a few action classics - Die Hard and The Terminator spring to mind - The Expendables is more in the vein of laughable junk like Commando. Indeed, with its by-the-numbers plot, cardboard characters, and lame action scenes, The Expendables pays tribute to the genre at its worst rather than its best.    I'm surprised at Stallone, who is capable of thoughtful writing and direction ... whenever he works on Rocky movies. Somehow, when he steps out of Rocky's shoes, the IQ of his output drops about 70 points. The fact that more people saw The Expendables than Rocky Balboa - an infinitely worthier film - is depressing to me, in the extreme.    Where do I start complaining about this film? Every scene, every character, and every line of dialog is a bad cliche. None of the characters is developed at all, beyond being given the most superficial traits (this guy is good at throwing knives ... this guy has a really loud gun). The first half hour of the film drags terribly, with no memorable action scenes; then the action starts, and it's all fast cutting, repetitive explosions, and terrible digital effects (including digital violence ... always dumb-looking). At one point, there's a shot of a building being destroyed that manages to look much faker than similar special effects in recent Godzilla films. Tsk, tsk.    Needless to say, the film is politically incorrect in the extreme. The Expendables are apparently \\"liberating\\" an island from tyranny, but none of the islanders has any personality or significant screen time. The two female characters in the movie, meanwhile, have almost nothing to do; I think Charisma Carpenter of \\"Buffy\\" fame has about three lines of dialog in the whole movie. Was it really necessary to make the script so aggressively offensive?    Lest I go overboard with the complaints, I will now cite one positive aspectof the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo rocks. In one brief scene, he manages to prove that he's a much more charismatic actor than Stallone (provided that Stallone isn't playing Rocky, that is).    As for the DVD itself, the special features include: a making-of special (in case you want to know how nonsense like this ever gets made); a pointless deleted scene; a commentary in which Stallone says things like \\"explosions are unpredictable\\"; and a gag reel, the highlight of which involves Eric Roberts belching on camera. A worthily stupid package for this movie, then.    In conclusion, I declare that all fans of this movie should be forced to watch good movies (e.g., When a Woman Ascends the Stairs; The Best of Youth) until they develop an appreciation for human drama that isn't unrelentingly awful. And if you must watch action movies, surely the aforementioned Die Hard is a better choice?

B00061QJZI|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Introduced it to a new generation (my kids), who are now obsessed with it.
0439023521|4.0|This is a review of the whole trilogy, as I read them the one directly after the other and I find it very difficult to separate the stories. The cover pictured is from my actual book (isn't it beautiful?)<br /><br />  As most of you know, this is a series of three dystopian novels: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. The are about a future America where there are no United States, only 13 districts where poverty rules and the Capitol, where a dictator-like president lives and thrives along with the pampered, rich people. This president has established The Hunger Games which occur once every year, with the purpose of entertainment to the population of the Capitol, and the purpose of punishing and keeping in line the districts. The first novel in the series begins when the heroine, Katniss goes to the Hunger Games to fight with other 23 people (a boy and a girl from each of the 12 districts, including a boy from her own district) to the death. Because only one boy or girl can survive the Hunger Games.<br />But this year it's different.<br /><br />  I loved these books. Of course, let it be known that they contain a lot of blood and violence, and as that they are not suitable for children or teenagers.<br />  I loved the revolution, I think it is the most up-to-date concept. I loved the parallels between this dystopian society and our own. I loved Katniss' spunk and courage in the face of every impossibility. And I loved that she never stoped believing that, even though something had never happened before, it could happen this once, for her, for the people she cared about, for the first time. This faith, even though it deteriorated by the end, was what pulled her through everything.<br />I also enjoyed the love story, and found it very realistic and accurate. I didn't find a love triangle in these books, like other readers have thought, I don't think there exists one. As for Katniss' behaviour, it was only natural that she should be concerned first about her survival (and Peeta's) and then about falling in love and making out. I think this was out of the question for her in the majority of all three books.<br /><br />  There was one thing I didn't like, and that was the death of a character in Mockingjay, the final book, because I thought it was unessecary and didn't do anything to help the plot along. On the contrary, I think the author might have found herself with a character she created that was by far superior to the protagonists, and didn't know what to do with him, because he overshadowed them. So, she killed him off. That is a very poor reason to kill a character, and I have seen it in other books. I think it shows lack of strength and skill in the part of the author.<br /><br />  I also wanted to say here, as far as the ending of the trilogy is concerned, that is to say part of the final book, that I really liked how the revolution went on, the contrasts between the old world and the new one they wanted to built, but also the similarities. I think that is very true, because human nature always tend to fall in the same mistakes, and power does something strange to people, even those with the best intetions. It has the potential to make them evil and that was beautifully portrayed in these books.<br /><br />  This book was something to think about for days after you finished the trilogy, not something fun to enjoy. If every reader who gets a hold of this book should then think of even one thing concerning themselves, then that would be time well spent.<br /><br />One last thing.<br />  The modern-day arena really interigued me when I first decided I wanted to read these books, so I went ahead and bought them, even though I was afraid they would be depressing (which they aren't, surprisingly enough. They are really encouraging overall.). However, I thought that in this arena there wasn't much to root for, since the kids only fought for survival. Now, if there had been something else at stake, like there was forChristians in the arena at Roman times, their beliefs, or something, that would be something to get excited about. That's what I thought, personally, although admittedly, in the second and third books, there is indeed much more going on than mere survival. That's what made their angst and struggles so exciting for the reader.<br /><br />These books prove that, as I always believed, if there is something worth living for, then that same thing must be worth dying for, and even more so.<br /><br />Rating: The Hunger Games 5/5<br />Catching Fire 4.5/5<br />Mockingjay 3/5<br />The Trilogy 4/5<br />[...]the arena at Roman times, their beliefs, or something, that would be something to get excited about.

014241543X|4.0|This story about a girl who hovers between life and death after a devastating accident that took the rest of her family gripped me from the start.<br />It is told in many flashbacks, featuring her life and her relationship with her parents and her boyfriend.<br />The main theme of the book is that the girl herslef has to decide if she wants to live or just give up and die.<br /><br />This book really touched me. It was full of warm moments and warm people. It was very romantic, too, but there was so much more to it. I enjoyed the human relationships and I embraced the idea that we are resposnible for fighting for our life, even when things are going bad.<br />This book makes you think about what is important in life, about what a person has to live for when almost everything is taken from them.<br /><br />I only had one problem with this book and that problem is God. It seemed like the author doesn't believe in God. That she thinks God doesn't care enough or isn't powerful enough to give one the will and the courage to live. I want to say here that that is not true.<br />God is alive, He is real, and He is the Only One Who can give life or take it. He is also the only reason for living.<br /><br />Anyway, I wouldn't suggest giving to your teen this book to read, if you aren't sure he or she has a firm belief in God because, even though He is mentioned very rarely in this book, even that little might shake a teen's faith. Otherwise it is a good book, full of meaning and depth, especially if you are a christian and can see God's hand working through the characters' pain and grief (even if the author herself can't).<br /><br />Rating: 4/5<br /><br />http:bookshelfstories.blogspot.com

The Sunshine Soup is out-of-this-world delicious, balancing perfectly the flavors of the corn and the peppers and providing warm sunshine to the eyes and the tummy.  It was quick and uncomplicated and the perfect accompaniment to 38+ inches of snow one January weekend.  The same can be said of her prose.

B003TT2X72|5.0|After the Fellowship has been broken, Hobbit friends Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise (Sean Astin) go on their quest to Mordor but during their journey, they encounter the sneaky and vile creature known as Gollum a.k.a.

The Fellowship such as Aragon (Viggo Morgenstein), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (Jonathan Rhys-Davis) go after the ones that kidnapped Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) as they find out that Saruman (Christopher Lee) who is the puppet of Sauron sends out many armies to join in the ultimate battle of good vs. evil while they must protect the kingdom of Isengard ruled by aging king Theodon (Bernard Hill) who was under a dark spell from Grima Wormtounge (Brad Douriff) as the battle will begin and the now recovered Gandolf (Ian Mckellen) joins them.<br /><br />Co-starring Miranda Otto as female warrior Eowyn, Cate Blancett as Gladriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Liv Tyler as Arwen and Karl Urban as warrior Eomer this is a spectacular and brilliant adaptation of Tolkein's beloved second chapter in his amazing literary fantasy trilogy now told on the big screen in a glorious way. This is a sequel that surpasses the first one with more action, more epic and more scope thanks to the magic of Peter Jackson and company as they even made a new landmark in special effects on their creatures including Gollum who steals the show with a brilliant motion-capture CGI performance that earned Andy Serkis into stardom much like Zoe Salander was to Avatar.

0307474275|5.0|I am not ashamed to have read the book long after the movie version came out. The book is a separate entity. It is unique look into symbology, myth, art and history played in the present among locations accessible to anyone who wants to see them.<br /><br />It is an interesting, intriguing and insightful novel.<br /><br />The chapters are short, start with intrigue and end with suspense - thus giving the reader an illusion of fast-paced page-turner. But the story is grand and the plot a thriller. The timeless quest for the Holy Grail is replayed in modern times, with present day people reaching for the extraordinary.<br /><br />The book is a must-read not because millions of copies have been sold in multiple languages but because it is a uniquely thrilling tale and a story that the generation will always recall instantly on mention. It is much better than the movie of course.

B003UESJHE|5.0|What a wonderful film this is.  Extraordinary performances from the usual crowd of British actors from the Theahahtter\\" (pronounce this word  - `Theater' with a frightfully posh accent), who condescend to step down from the boards from time to time, and put a performance down on film for the money -or for posterity - from time to time.  Yet here are performances that left me in awe. Acting of this stature is really a craft that must take years of training to return performances of this standard.    My old mother tells me frequently (Just don't get her started on The WAR!) that as a 20-year old; that during a particularly heavy air raid on my home town, a mine had dropped into her street of terraced houses.  Fortunately, it went off with more of a crump than a bang but was sufficient to blow out all the windows of the houses in the street and burst the water main.  My mother had to struggle to work for her fourteen-hour shift making surgical field dressings for the military: As was her usual routine, and as was expected - turn up for \\"War Work\\" - or else.  She couldn't bathe or fix her make-up or do any of the usually girlie stuff before the \\"All Clear\\" sounded, and she could set off in the winter darkness to catch her tram.  Feeling thoroughly miserable as can be imagined in the circumstances, having to pick her way through the rubble and debris she made her way to work just as dawn was breaking.  During her mid-day break for lunch she slipped out of the plant to do some shopping where she encountered a small group of exited people causing something of a stir.  Thinking that the firemen and ARP wardens must have discovered something horrible in a bombed-out building; she shuddered and had intended headed off in the opposite direction.  It was then that she had the shock of her life.  There before her stood - the King and the Queen!  There they were.  Unbelievable!  They were probably two of the most famous people in the whole world outside of Hitler and Churchill atthat stage of WW2.  King George VI in uniform and Queen Elizabeth dressed in all her jewels, furs and finery, treading carefully through the rubble of shattered buildings. Accompanied by only a couple off plain-clothed police officers they had come to visit and hopefully raise the morale of the ordinary people struggling through such a devastating trial. They must have succeeded brilliantly because if my family were anything to go by then King George and Queen Elizabeth must have been deeply revered during, and after the war.  I personally have no recollection of the King.  One of my earliest memories is of the coronation; but I did meet the late Queen Mother once which was a mighty fine experience and an unforgettable episode that made a great impression on me at the time.  I still miss the old \\"Queen Mum\\".  So you see - I had broken my usual habit of waiting until the DVD comes out, and went watch this new film in a cinema instead - such was my eagerness to see it.  This will be one of those rare movies that I can watch over and over again and find something new to appreciate that I had never noticed before.  A must see...
B004132HZS|5.0|As a confirmed Sherlockian who has read the entire Doyle canon multiple times and raged and wept over some of the less fortunate pastiches, movies and other portrayals of the world's only consulting detective, I naturally had to watch the latest incarnation of Sherlock Holmes. I have to say, I was highly satisfied.     What I immediately felt when I began watching this series was the feeling of a clean new slate. It felt like the writers tossed aside all the previous interpretations and went back to the original source. We meet Sherlock as a young man, just as we do in the original story. I know that some of my family found it disconcerting and even unbelievable that someone so young could be so brilliant and I almost shouted my answer-because that's the point! Sherlock Holmes was a freakishly brilliant young man and so many other portrayals show him much later in life.     Obviously, the setting is modern England. However, they even handle technology in a canon manner. In the original stories, Holmes was on the cutting edge of current science and technology. So in his modern incarnation, he is an obsessive user of texting and the internet, which dovetails perfectly with this fact.      Even the more famous quotes are woven in in fresh and engaging ways. Some have been slightly changed and other classics remain untouched, but they all feel as if they fit the story at hand, not as if they are ham-handed nods to the text.     I found the nicotine patches an amusing play on the old tobacco habit but possibly my one quibble over the series is the way that they stay firmly away from Holmes' more serious drug issues. They are referenced but as if they are not current problems. I look forward to seeing if they touch on this more deeply in the future.      As far as aethestics go, the costuming is done with a light touch and the music is engaging and romantic. Fans of Doctor Who will recognize a similar feel in music and sometimes in writing styles, as some of the writersfor that show have also worked on this series. One particularly interesting 'cross-over' feel is in the recent Christmas episode with Matt Smith when the Doctor figures out that the old man was frightened of his father. Not only is the logic similar, but the camera work is actually also quite evocative of this series. Whatever these writers are doing, I hope they keep doing it!     Highly recommended-I can't put into words how much this series has reignited my love of Sherlock Holmes and made me eager for more.
1408812673|2.0|Follow what I say, not what I do is Amy Chua watchword.  For her daughter she suggests Chinese values, for herself, it is all American.  While family name is important in Chinese society, she quickly rejects adoption of her husband's name and embraces a feminist agenda.  Unlike the traditional Chinese wife who might defer to her husband, Chua makes it clear she runs, if not dominates this household.  If Chua was afraid of her mother, and Chua's daughter afraid of her, no one is more scared that Chua's timid husband.      Many liked circuses until they saw how elephants were beaten, shocked, and mistreated, now we can see the abuse behind the Carnegie show.  According to Chua, it is not a child who loves music and showed creativity at an early age who plays, but a child screamed at, and if necessary starved to become a human circus act. The child labor laws in Hollywood were created to stop parents from exploiting children, and a similar phenomenonis seen here.  Like Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle and Betty Davis' Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, this book makes a powerful statement,  though not what the author intended.
031603438X|2.0|I love the blues, and worship the guitar playing of Keith Richards. I could only read the first 5 chapters of his life before I had had enough.

6304884419|3.0|Very frustrating!  This film begins with great story telling and  deep character development. The plot  unfolded gracefully and with nuance--   in the best tradition of \\"small\\"  or \\"old style\\" films. Hollywood without  the glitz, or the best European cinema.  Basically playing against stereotype.    About 2/3rds of the way through, five   plot developments were blatantly introduced.   They were so obvious, I was able to guess  what would happen in each case. Seems  almost like another writer stepped in  and fashioned the movie's climax.   It basically featured very ordinary & familiar   \\"tragic plot development\\" from classic   literature. My wife was in the kitchen,  and I kept saying \\"If --- happens, I'm turning  this off!\\" or \\"Now --- has to die!\\"  Yeah, I can be annoying :^)  In the end, the characters  philosophised about life in a pretty hollow  way. What a letdown.
1433523930|5.0|This is a good bible.  It is a little large but the good side is that it has colored pictures of things described in the bible like the Ark of the Covenant.  Also, I find the footnotes very detailed and helpful.  When my husband and I are discussing biblical issues we always end up looking it up in this bible.  We like it very much!
0817439390|5.0|I enjoyed this book quite a lot.  I have a higher-end point and shoot camera and I do have the ability to change various settings (aperature / shutter speed / ISO / white balance etc).  I had a basic understanding of what various settings are used for, but this book helped to really drive home the importance of various factors and settings when taking pictures and how you can use them to achieve different results.  Even though some of the book focused on DSLR specific features, I still recommend it for people with higher-end point and shoot cameras as well.  Each photograph in the book has all the info about what settings were used to achieve the shot.  Definitely recommended!

B003TJR2HS|4.0|Got this for my Scion 1808 radio with iPod cable.  It is the older 12v charging and this makes is work for my iPhone 4 and 3GS.  I even tried in my old iPhone 2G dock and it works with the 3GS (otherwise is doesn't fit).  Great product, but my only complaint is that the logo (in white on black) is the back side of the charger, so for the loose cable in my car, I kept trying to put it in upside down for the first few times.
144471032X|5.0|I came upon this diet back in Oct. 2010 by a fortunate accident at a supermarket checkout line. There was this Woman's Day magazine with a big headline on the cover. I thank God every day I bought that magazine and introduced me to this diet. Once I read the basics of the four phases and saw how structured and easy to follow each phase was, I wasted no time and ordered the book. I am happy and proud to report I followed it strictly and lost 25lbs. Started at 155lbs and even through the holidays, I allowed myself to enjoy some of the holiday treats but still managed to keep the weight off. If you believe this is another fad diet, I'm happy to report, you'll be surprised at the results. Dr. Dukan's book is easy to understand. He breaks down each diet phase and explains the science of his his method. He understands the frustration of weight loss/gain and gives the reader the \\"tools\\" and knowledge  in a straighforward approach so that you can manage food for the rest of your life, not just while \\"dieting\\". Again, this is based on his experience with his patients. There is NO calorie counting, eat until you're full so no starving. However, you have to follow his rules. I highly recommend the book and Dr. Dukan's programme. *One last thing, as with any weight reduction programme, 30 minutes daily minimum exercise is part of his prescription. The more you exercise the quicker results and above all: 1.5liters of water or liquids including coffee,teas or diet soda cannot contain more than 1 calorie!
B003YUC2FE|4.0|I absolutely love these movies and when I saw that I could get this set including blu ray and normal disc's I though it would be wonderful, and it is. I have the blu rays in the house and the normal discs in the car for portable DVD player for those long trips. The only thing I can fault with the product is it is really not kid friendly. The discs are just placed in polystyrene and so very easy for small children to get their hands on. I have had to put it up high to avoid disc being spread all over the house and ruined.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I bought a set of these and the second time I used them, the control module on them started getting really hot and a burning smell started coming out of it.  I unplugged it and tried again later with the same result.  Amazon was quick to replace them and the new set works great, but I don't know how long they will really last.      There is a slight hissing noise, but its only noticable when there is almost no sound going on in the game.  Overall I think these are a good deal for the price.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Okay, so you probably know where the movie is going after the first 30 minutes, but for some reason you don't really mind. The plot may be cookie cutter, but it is presented in a very funny and original way.<br /><br />I think the animation looks spectacular on Blu-ray. The sound is also great.<br /><br />The minions are what make the movie, simple as that. They are hilarious!
030746363X|5.0|I hate reading about workouts, diets, and know-it-all infodumps that seem designed to make you feel like there's something wrong with you.  This is NOT that kind of book.  Tim Ferriss says right out front that he promises nothing.  Filled with self-experimentation, funny, entertaining stories, and a new way to think about yourself and the world around you, 4-Hour Body brings a grin to my face every time I crack it open and read another chapter.  Great fun!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|each season of supernatural just keeps getting better and better. I really hate to see it go after this season. The Winchester brothers are trying to keep the world from ending and Sam thinks he is the only one who can do it. They defeat the 4 horseman (whom instead of rising horses ride sweet cars) and take their rings to try and stop Lucifer. The boy connect with a brother they didn't know they had as well.  Not giving anything else away but it's a very power and climatic ending to the season.
0743277708|5.0|Few books have stayed with me from youth to adulthood like this one.  \\"Watership Down\\" is possibly my favorite work of literature.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Even if animated movies are more prone to be displayed with high quality and fidelity because of the nature of their content, it is still impressive and arguably enjoyable to get \\"the best\\" out of your video system. The movie itself is fun, clearly not as fun as \\"how to train your dragon\\" to my taste but still good. I will update on the 3D aspect when I'll receive my 3D Panasonic TV tomorrow :))    As promised, here is the update about 3D:    the good: very clean and depth is really impressive. It is such a blast to look at a 3D movie at home on a huge screen.    The bad: What I cannot understand is that those guys that made the movie can really make things pop out of the screen (toward you). But they didn't do it enough to my taste. I understand that you do not want to over do it and loose the interest for the story line to the profite of just amazing 3D effects but still, there are only 4 times where things really pop out and you actually get the impression you can touch them. It is really cool when it happens but for me, it doesn't happen often enough.

B0021L8V0M|4.0|I am surprised that I like the film.     I usually give an action flick a high rating if it's better than I expected, if I wished it was longer, or if I tend to miss that it was slow in various parts of the movie. I didn't have a problem with the believability of the film as I understand that with many flicks we need to suspend disbelief. Truth is stranger than fiction so it's possible that some of the covert missions of various forms of the government actually happen. If you listen to accounts from the Navy SEALS it sounds possible. Can she do any of this? I don't know, so I suspend disbelief.     I like that she was able to (as another reviewer suggested) lay waste to her compadres. She was deftly able to manage counterattacks. She seemed to be a peer among her friends, and that she had a good sense of her role was impressive.    I know people swoon over her but I don't find her attractive, and her appearance takes away from the enjoyment of her films. She is entirely too skinny and  her lips are a distraction. I find that her body is off kilter somehow. WHO she is as an actress is part of the overall flavor of the film for me her appearance detracts from the rating.

1594202842|5.0|If a book can inspire or stimulate people to THINK about learning, raising kids, and what kind of a parent we are, this one certainly does that. What else could we possibly want when we read books? Amy Chua has done the impossible--writing a frank memoir that is also hilarious about her family and herself as a mother--racing to make sure that they have everything they could possibly need to excel, including herself drilling them with flashcards and timing with a stopwatch! Anyone who takes this personally and gets on their high horse to judge Chua has missed the boat; it would be more fruitful to transform their outrage into some soul-searching about why our children don't read anymore; or feel they are entitled to do well in school when they don't put out any effort, except to just get by.     In our family, my grown daughters and I have read most of the book aloud to each other, laughing and remembering so many of the things that made their growing up challenging and also wonderful. Yes, I am Chinese and grew up in a family where excellence was an unspoken measure of our character and a given that we would work hard. I didn't chase my kids with a two-by-four when they misbehaved, but my father did. I was the only one who stood up to him (like Lulu does to Chua) and I think he respected that--just as Amy Chua does. One of my daughters teaches high school in an affluent suburb of Boston and relates that in the last ten years, students appear to be more helpless about their studies; and that parents don't seem to have any idea what goes on their heads, much less talk with them about what they are doing at school. We can talk all we want about the need to improve education by paying teachers more. But in our family, reading, being curious, talking about politics, listening to music all start at home. We enjoyed it and everyone thrived on it. Bravo to Chua for writing a book that starts the dialogue about excellence in the USA to focus on where it all begins: at home.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|If your portable audio device is maxed out on volume and still not loud enough, you will like this little amplifier. Very little distortion, and a noticeable volume gain, especially if you use earbuds or a less sensitive style of headphones.<br /><br /> Rechargable battery (USB style) , nice patch cords (including a Y splitter, for two listeners) ,bass boost (meh..) and a volume control set this apart from the cheaper E3 model, although the output and overall sound is about the same on both units (I own both) . I've beat the crap out of both, using it on my motorcycle in all conditions, and both are going strong. If cash is tight, you can buy the E3 and save $10 , otherwise buy the E5. Be a hero, buy extras for your buddies...they'll want one as soon as they try out yours !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't often read YA novels, but the attention this series has been receiving intrigued me, and I was in the mood for a quick sci-fi read anyway.  Turns out that \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a terrific novel that many adults will likely enjoy.  The basic plot has been outlined numerous times in previous reviews here - in a future version of North America, each of 12 colonies has to select by lottery one boy and one girl to fight in the Hunger Games, which is a televised battle to the death.  Our heroine is Katniss Everdeen from impoverished coal-mining District 12.  She has all the requisite skills for the games, given that she has had to become a hunter to support her mother and younger sister following the death of her father.<br /><br />Katniss makes for a fantastic, likeable heroine; she's not portrayed as invincible or unduly brave.  She's a fairly average young woman who shows tremendous resourcefulness when placed in an impossible situation.  I appreciated that author Suzanne Collins didn't try to make her of superhero stuff; instead, Katniss' reactions are realistic, which helps ground the story.  For a sci-fi novel, the book generally is quite realistic, and therefore rather violent for a YA book.  However, I think it's quite appropriate for its target audience (14 years and up).  Although the book is classified as sci-fi, I think it will appeal to many readers who do not regularly read in that genre.  In particular, the survival and outdoors aspects set it apart from many sci-fi novels.  I don't often read sci-fi but I was sucked into the story immediately.  The book is extremely well-written and plotted - a true page turner.<br /><br />When I'm reading a book series, a good indicator of how much I'm enjoyed the current entry is how long I wait until I download the next book onto my Kindle.  Let's just say that \\"Catching Fire\\" was downloaded and ready to go long before I completed reading \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  I can't wait to see what direction this series goes in next.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|I continuosly am dissappointed at the select people who rate this film , better yet the series, poorly. Coming from a a person who hates horror films for everything they have to offer, I absolutely love PA 1 & 2. Its a complete change-up on how horror movies are made and it is great. The constant suspense the movie has throughout the films amazes and creeps me out all at the same time. Kudos to Oren Peli for making such a low budget film into a great horror film that present day horror films should actualy look up on. The Paranormal Activity Series is going to continue to take the horror series into the next level. With all its thrills, suspense and depictions of what happens when you are really asleep. Many movie watchers are not going to be sleeping for awhile. Coming from now a new horror movie fan, I cant wait for PA 3.    My grade: A
0316017922|5.0|after reading the book, i looked at things differently; to the better for sure!  there are many little facts and details that actually showed me a new way of thinking  all those are very obvious but the obvious are always the things you missed everyday!    Highly recommend everyone to read this book, and I have to say this is prob. the best book by Malcolm Gladwell comparing with the others.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|RED is my favorite movie of 2010. I didn't know what to expect but since I love Bruce Willis, I gave it a try and am definitely happy I did! The action was artfully balanced with humor (Bruce Willis vacuuming!)as a suspenseful plot unfolds that actually had me on the edge of my seat in spots. Watch for the Karl Urban fight scene and Richard Dreyfuss as a rich sleezeball. Ernest Borgnine rounded out a sparkling cast in a couple of brief appearances. The only disappointment was the limited role of the ever cool, calm, and collected Morgan Freeman but this was was offset wonderfully by John Malkovich's hysterical antics.     The RED cast is free of female action figure stereotypes.  Both Helen Mirren and Mary-Louise Parker participate fully, each in their own manner, and yet never loose their warmth and femininity. Even the agent who faces off with John Malkovich in one scene is \\"real\\".  Refreshingly, there is no \\"sexploitation\\" in RED.    This is a movie the entire family can (and should) watch together. Simply put, it's pure entertainment.
B004FHCH9Q|4.0|I watched \\"Memento\\" because I saw it in the book \\"501 Must-See Movies\\".  My observation of the books selections is that a few of those movie I didn't really have to see but \\"Memento\\" is one that lived up to the billing.  I admit to being scepticle at first because it seemed that I was watching the movie backwards in sequences.  I wondered what kind of movie it would be since much of it was rerun scenes.  However, I realized that this was a unique movie that keeps the viewers guessing (although I can imagine that some may have taken it back to the video rental without watching the whole movie).  The retelling of the various scenes created impressions as well as doubts and that really came together at the end.  However, the ending was not typical either.  It left us wondering what is the reality.  Along the way there were at least two or three scenes where I had to double-check to see if what I saw was real or not.  \\"Memento\\" has a plot but it seems less important to the film than the twists and turns it takes us on.  In the end, I was pretty dazed by what I had seen but I knew it had been an exciting ride.  I suggest most people should watch \\"Memento\\" at least once (excepting small children and pregnant women).  I don't know that I will watch it again but I'm sure there are a lot of people who do watch it over and over.  I wouldn't be surprized to hear them say they see something new each time.

0385504225|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who questioned reading it. I could not put down this book once i began reading it!
0316067938|5.0|It was a gift for my daughter and said she couldn't put it down.  Thank you so much for getting it shipped so quickly.
030746363X|4.0|Tim Feriss has come up with some fascinating ideas and suggestions, but it ain't an easy job getting to grips with them. The structure of this book is a godawful mess. Info that should be together is scattered across the book, with tables and diagrams interpolated in a seemingly random way.    Body for Life this is not.
B0046MOVD0|2.0|Last and certainly the least in this latest sequel of the Resident Evil movies. I loved the original and bought the sequels up until this one. Each was a little less than the movie before, and none as good as the original. This Resident Evil doesn't even merit me adding it to my DVD library. Nothing new at all to the storyline. You know what is going to happen, because they told you in the last sequel she was going after her creators. Well that's what she does, and the whole movie is one long drawn out gunfight between her and her duplicates killing the undead and the Umbrella Corporation soldiers. I would suggest you rent it first like I did. That way you won't get it home and say, what was I thinking? Well you may say that when you rent it as well, but you won't be out quite as much. Just a couple hours of your time. If you liked this you will love the others, and if you have already seen them and you still liked this one I suggest [[ASIN:B00195FUDC Doomsday (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]]. I like it more than this movie.<br /><br />P.S. Already got one negative vote, probably from an eight year old that loved the movie. So typical, they rate reviews based on emotional hormones for Milla and lots of bloody action rather than a reviews content. Hope some adults out there agree this was by far not the best in the series.<br /><br />CA Luster
B004HWYTP4|2.0|This movie was a MAJOR disappointment - great cast, terrible screenplay.  NO meat to this story.  It relied solely on the draw of the ensemble cast.  I feel bad for them that the story was so thin.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I am giving this CD a 5-star rating.  It has a wonderful selection of Christmas music, a celebration of Christmas away from the traditional, but meaningful just the same.  I first heard the CD at a friend's home and decided to order several copies to give as gifts. Perfect for James Taylor fans and all music lovers!
0195067142|5.0|Sledge makes no bones about the fact that he detested the war.  He detested the barbarism it brought out in men - both the Japanese and the Americans.  He details the sights, sounds and smells of war as much as words permit.  It's unpleasant and could even be sickening for some.  But he tells it as it was.  He also describes the life they lived during that time - both on the battlefield and off.  There are light moments of humor and comraderie, there is despair and boredom, and there is panic and terror.  Reading this book, one comes to understand the great sacrifice these men made and the hell they endured.  One also comes to understand how the battles were conducted, from the front lines to the rear echelon.  While the \\"rear echelon\\" troops were often disparaged, Sledge takes care not to paint all of such service personnel with a broad stroke.  He pulls no punches, but neither does he generalize in his criticisms.  He does not inflate himself or draw undo attention to himself and his efforts - he simply tells of his experiences as he saw them, in a spirit of humility and reality, recognizing his role in the big picture.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in really knowing what it was like.  If you're drawn into this topic due to the HBO miniseries \\"The Pacific\\", I would definitely recommend this book.  I would not recommend Leckie's \\"Helmet for my Pillow.\\"  Another great read I would highly recommend, that explains the naval portion of the invasions is [[ASIN:1935149210 D-DAYS IN THE PACIFIC WITH THE US COASTGUARD: The Story of Lucky 13]] by Ken Wiley, detailing his time as a Higgins boat driver in the war. It is one of the most riveting and engaging and interesting books I have read regarding the war in the Pacific.  Between Sledge and Wiley, you'll know as much as you can know of what it was like.
0345528581|3.0|I have bought exercise books previously, such as yoga, running, etc. They didn't keep my interest though. I like this particular because it focuses only on bodyweight exercises and exercises you can do at home. The author even encourages you to workout alone if you want to. After hearing so many people preach that the only way to really work out is to go to the gym or have a \\"workout partner,\\" this is refreshing. I have never been interested in going to the gym or doing a lot of cardio.     The exercises are good and are demonstrated well. The author's stories about his experiences are great. He lays information about nutrition and the body out and makes it easy to understand.     The only issues I have with the book are:  1. It is obviously focused toward people who want to do more \\"body building\\" workouts. He assumes you want to work out with these exercises four times a week, without thinking about how some people may not want to do only those exercises.   2. Along with the body building thing, he says we should eat a high protein diet, which I don't necessarily agree with. This is the typical muscle diet and it seems like at times it's more about bulking up than health.  3. It is basically geared more toward men, although there is a woman pictured and she isn't overly bulky. He doesn't include anything extra for women and at times sounds as if he is assuming you are a man.  4. At times I detected kind of a cocky \\"military\\" attitude.     It would have been nice if he had explained how to implement these exercises if you only want to do them sometimes, along with other types of exercise.
B003UGLCIA|4.0|I have always heard of this movie but never saw it until recently. A good, strong story the Exorcist is about a young girl who becomes possessed by a demon (or something!) and her mother seeks out a Catholic priest to perform an exorcism to banish it. The acting in the film is first-rate and makes the characters feel real where many movies like this would have made them 2-dimensional. The videography was also awesome. The only two weaknesses I feel is the pace of the film (which is slow at some parts but it allows for good character development) and some plot points which never seem resolved. They are minor but irritating. For instance, what was the relevency to the opening location? You never really find out but I'm sure the novel probably makes it clear. Well worth watching!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|The puzzles reminded me of the puzzles in Professor Layton, but there are far less to solve in this game. The main difference in puzzles is that in 999 one puzzle often links directly to another, and you have to find tools to use to solve the puzzle. Basically each room is a set of puzzles, and all of the puzzles within each room lead up to reaching the final room puzzle. For me, having less puzzles was a great trade off for the plot I got in return. I'm more motivated in solving puzzles if I know some meaty plot information is waiting for me once I do. As much as I enjoyed Professor Layton and The Curious Village, I wouldn't say that any of the plot was \\"meaty\\".    The facial expressions and character designs reminded me of Phoenix Wright. Each character has art done for say half a dozen facial expressions, and as the conversation goes on the animation just switches between these expressions. I know other JRPGs employ this method but it still reminded me of Phoenix Wright more.    Despite the fearful situation everyone is in, the game has a sense of humor that I enjoyed. I also liked how I slowly got to know each of the characters' personalities and their backgrounds. At one point in the game one of the conversations actually made me laugh out loud. The game's narration is great too, horrific scenes are typically off screen, but the internal dialogue of the Main Character (Junpei) probably paints a far more fearsome image in the player's mind than any artist could hope to accomplish, and still stay within the spirit of the game.    I loved this game, and if Aksys ever makes another well done survival/murder mystery game I'll look forward to it with a lot of enthusiasm. HOWEVER, I loaned this game to a friend and he found the amount of text unbearable. He also couldn't stand the instructions for how to input a code in a puzzle repeating themselves every time you tapped on the device. In the meanwhile I'll try some of their other games that seem similar. Growing up Isearched for games like this one, I played Myst and some Nancy Drew video games for example, but none of these games felt even close to holding a candle to motivating me like this game has. I can't remember the last time I loved a game so much that I'd give up an entire weekend just to play it. I plan on playing Theresia (also by Aksys) next, but I'm not confident that it will equal 999.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|It's great to see companies reviving marvellous classics like Forbidden Planet.  It is arguably one of the best sci-fi colour classics of all time. Starring Leslie Neilson, Walter Pidgeon and Anne Francis, it makes for compelling viewing especially if you have the 50th anniversary two disc edition, where you have numerous features to explore. It still stacks up as a masterpiece, even in the twenty first century. Well worth a look if you are a movie classics or science fiction fan.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This book was entertaining.  Once you get through about 1/4 of it, you are interested enough to read more, but you are not hooked until about the halfway point when you finally understand why you are reading what seems like 2 novels.  There are a lot of unnecessary details.  The suspect is predictable... as in, it is exactly your first guess, but the author does make you waver.  The unraveling of the mystery at the end is good, but a slight bit absurd and somewhat arbitrary (maybe I missed something).  And when you think it is done, he writes another whole chapter describing in excruciating detail about how a minor plot gets resolved... The dragon tattoo is not relevant to the story... and that was disappointing.<br /><br />I was obviously entertained enough that I read most of it in one sitting, but found myself hoping the story would move faster quite a bit.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|There were so many unanswered questions at the end of the last book. The author did an excellent job of finalizing the series.
B00000J7A2|5.0|Captain Beefheart (Don Van Vliet), who died as a result of a longstanding illness in December 2010 at the age of sixty nine, was a one off - on one hand a frenzied, shaman-like figure in live performance, on the other a meglomaniacal micromanager of musicians who created a revolving door through which the many, many members of his fabled Magic Band came and went.<br /><br />The Captain never had anything resembling a hit single, yet his influence on popular music is immense. A singer, songwriter, harmonica player and avant-guarde saxman, he was a tremendous natural musician with a five octave vocal range. Echoes of his music can be found in artists like The Fall, The Scientists, Gang Of Four, Tom Waits and The White Stripes, to name just a few. When American rock journalist Lester Bangs said that Beefheart was \\"one of the four or five unqualified geniuses to rise from the hothouses of American music in the Sixties\\", no one argued.<br /><br />Much of Beefheart's reputation stems from his career-defining 1969 double album \\"Trout Mask Replica\\", which sports avant-guarde (yes, that word again) lyrics, put to free-jazz influenced musical noodlings from his Magic Band. Many people profess to love it. Personally, I find it unlistenable.<br /><br />So for me \\"Safe As Milk\\", along with the later \\"Clear Spot\\", represents his greatest, most accessible and rocking work.<br /><br />\\"Safe\\" was the Magic Band's debut album, recorded in 1967 after they had achieved a small regional hit in their native Southern California with a cover of Bo Diddley's \\"Diddy Wah Diddy\\". The album was released on Buddhah Records, one of the many small labels pushing the underground bands of the time.<br /><br />Probably his most bluesy record, \\"Safe\\" kicks off with the Mississippi delta-charged moan and strut of \\"Sure `Nuff Yes I Do\\", as the Captain blows harp over a churning syncopated rhythm section and sounds for all the world like a deranged Howlin' Wolf. For probably the only time in his career, Beefheart sought help in arranging and recording the Magic Band's work. Hand picked for the task was an impossibly young Ryland P (Ry) Cooder, barely out of school and in as Beefheart's musical foil and de facto band leader. Cooder's stinging slide guitar work and blues sensibility help the band provide a perfect and innovative backdrop for The Captain's idiosyncracies.<br /><br />And what glorious idiosyncracies they are, from the trippy California psych blues of \\"Zig Zag Wanderer\\", \\"Electricity\\" (where The Captain manages to sound like Charley Patton on a very bad trip) and \\"Abba Zabba\\" to the tough but sensitive R n B of \\"Where There's Woman\\" and the sublime 50s doo wop influenced \\"I'm Glad\\". This is a deeply nuanced and varied record - of its time and yet transcending it.<br /><br />At his best, Beefheart's nonsense lyrics, his almost childlike wonder at the world and everything in it can evoke a joyousness beyond words - \\"Safe As Milk\\" captures this spirit and melds it to some of the most committed music he and the Magic Band ever recorded.ecording the Magic Band's work.
