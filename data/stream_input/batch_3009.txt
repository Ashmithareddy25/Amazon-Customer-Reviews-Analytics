B008K9SG9K|5.0|Filled with great modern rock songs that show both angst and tender hearted love ballads. If you like their singles on the radio that album won't disappoint.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I love me some Kick-Ass. Few movies have me actively cheering for the heroes and being thoroughly satisfied when the villains get their just desserts. It also has Hit-Girl and Nic Cage who are beyond entertaining.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Amazingly well done television - story line, acting, special effects. Some of the best television ever. I would recommend strongly to anyone, especially those interested in science fiction.
1400063736|4.0|McCann is trying a set of styles in the novel; modern, post-modern?  Not sure.  It reads like James Frey's 'Bright Shiny Morning' at times, but more inter-related.  The author shows that sentimentality is not dead in the modern novel, but he maintains a realistic perspective.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Loved, loved ,loved it!  It is what I have come to expect from 2 outstanding actresses!  Will watch again & again.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|I love this series of puzzles. You have to solve the logic problem to find out the mystery object in the picture. The logic problems are the fun part for me.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This was a familiar title that I did not get the chance to see. This movie had me on the edge of the sofa the whole time. The action never stopped. Well worth the watch!
B004CHURKA|3.0|a little disheartening to see that there's no print libretto. without it ( and the la scala is the same problem, ) how can you follow it when furt makes his cuts.  the libretto on cd is worthless unless you have two cd players playing the libretto on one and the music on the other. i mean, i have the solti printed libretto but it's difficult.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|this product is ideal for kids or halloween. I would not recomend it however, for coplay or convention you want a replica for that.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|WOW, I hard &agrave; hard time putting this book down, I am now getting the book written by Otto Frank or the book written by  Ann Franks Step-Mother.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is fun to play and its free to play which is awesome. I love the game so much its better han any other game I have played before.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome, I played this on my friends iPad and I didn't thing much of it so I played it more and thought it was epic.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this earlier work by Gillian Flynn. Not as good as Gone Girl but I feel that Flynn was simply warming up with this book before writing the masterpiece that is Gone Girl.<br /><br />The main character, Camille, is damaged in every sense of the word but that's what made me warm to her almost from the start. She doesn't whine about why she is the way she is or why she did what she did to herself but as with many people, she has her reasons for becoming the person she is and slowly reveals these reasons as the story progresses.<br /><br />The plot is well thought out and smart but you can kind of guess \\"whodunnit\\" from about the middle of the book. Nonetheless, it's a cracking read and well worth buying.
B00BZAJMWG|3.0|With all the hype over this movie, I didn't really care for it that much but was really happy with the ending.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|I grew up with this movie given that I am 24.  This is one of those must buy movies for me.  This version came with Bluray 3D, Bluray, DVD, the digital copy, and music that you can download from online.  This was well worth the purchase.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|A hodge-podge of goofy villians and 'heros' that always win - BORING !!<br /><br />The digital version was TOO dark or maybe that's what the movie version was filmed, really hard to see detail.<br /><br />I would NEVER buy such a goofy film.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I LOVE IT<br />BUY IT THE FREE ONE<br />BUY IT<br />TOTALY MY BELOVIN APP<br />GIVE YOUR SELF TNT F AND S<br />AND DAIMONDS<br />YAY FOR THE NEW APP<br />WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br />BUY IT!

1250027624|4.0|Makes you feel as if you are part of the set while reading this book. Enjoyment on every page. The photos are so true to form.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Amazing, I tried the experiments and the results were off the charts. Amazing, I could not believe what is bought into your consciousness when you actually really look around you.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this app buy I find that sometimes it freezes up and then I can not play it for a few minutes until it is good
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I love this book! So why three stars? The fault comes not in the story line, not in the characters, not in the tears I shed for them (and I did) but in the lofty vocabulary of the teens. Unrealistic even for those who thirst for knowledge and face the impending tragedy of life.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Read the reviews and decided to buy the game. Love the look, love the sound, love the challenge. I've finished the game, gone back to find all the gems and perfect solutions, and even found the hidden levels. Addictive. I've already started on the next edition.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best books I have ever read I highly recommend the hunger games trilogy . Best books ever!!!  Read it !!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The story of 4 women and their families.<br />Real issues and challenges, although somewhat exaggerated.<br />Doesn't conform to classic resolution and gives you something to think about even when you are done reading
0761169253|5.0|Love this book.  Great to give as a gift for the creative person who deserves a pat on the back!
B0007TKH66|5.0|I had forgotten how much I liked this series.  Brought back some good memories.  Its great to view theses without today's commercials every few minutes and interrupting the show.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I thought his might be too adolescent but really enjoyed it.  I Can't wait to read the next 2 books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Without giving any spoilers I have to say this is a great read! The biggest issue I have read that people have with this book is the ending. I've got to say I initially did not like it either. However, when I thought about it it had a creepy twilight zone, psycho feel to it. If it were a movie I'd imagine the final scene with the camera zooming out and the psycho theme playing.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Unbelievable for a first novel! Well written and couldn't put it down. Well worth a read and looking forward to another
B0056FMNYA|5.0|I have used it twice so far.  Easy to operate and love not having the camera hanging from my neck.  I also recommend purchasing the b-grip hand strap to go with it because you end up taking the neck strap off of the camera.  Wish I got this set up sooner.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It's plugged into the back of my TV, which is 20&#34; from my WiFi router and I continually get &#34;Network unavailable&#34; error messages. IF it works, it does exactly what it is supposed to do, broadcast from Chrome-enabled devices to my TV.<br /><br />If you already own a YouTube enabled device (Roku?, Tivo, etc) -- don't waste your money. This functionality has existed for some time and works a lot better!<br /><br />Chromium != Chrome. I use Chromium on Ubuntu and it complains about Chromium not being supported. I thought Chromium was to Chrome was Fedora was to Red Hat? Perhaps I misunderstood the dynamic/relationship.<br /><br />If you're watching Youtube on any device, you're given the opportunity to 'Skip this Ad' after 5s. On Chromecast, this is not true. You're forced to watch the ad in it's entirety. No one likes ads, no one ever will.<br /><br />At MSRP, it's too expensive, for even as cheap as it is. It's Alpha product at best, beta on a good day, but they've got a long ways to go before it's a consumer device for my (grand)parents. Also, there is no apparent way to exit/close the Android app to disable streaming to the device. As far as I can tell, you have to force quit the app.<br /><br />Wait 8+ months and buy -- hopefully it'll be better by then.
0786948523|5.0|Great book, i bought it for my son and he loves it, Has everything he wanted in it. Would recommend
B00881PTRC|5.0|I got this game for travel with my 11 year-old nephew.  It was a hit.  He especially liked all the ways the hanger tried to avoid the hangman when I was doing poorly guessing his word.  :)  It's a kick for kids and helps improve spelling and vocabulary.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|At first when an author tries to write a second book it scares me to the point I don't want to read them. I am so glad I didn't go that route. King did a great job on this book and takes nothing away from the Shining.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I have never had a problem connecting devices to my wifi before, which includes a Roku player, a blue ray DVD player, a printer, 3 computers and a smart phone.  Google tech support was worthless.  Nothing they suggested worked and I was passed around to several &#34;experts.&#34;  Even the help on the blogs did not help.<br /><br />Too bad, I was hoping to &#34;cut the cord&#34; with my cable company.
B001BANK32|5.0|I was late to this party for sure!  I wanted to read Doctor Sleep but had never read The Shining so I thought Its a good a time as ever.  I don't think I have ever read a book so quickly.  I had hard time putting it down and was totally immersed in it while reading it.  I loved it!!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I don't normally read young adult but my book club recommended this one.<br />I was quite surprised.  The book was very well written though a very tough subject<br />matter. I did indeed cry.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I find long waits at doctors appointments pass quickly when Mahjong is up and running and I am concentrating on this Mahjong.
B004X1D3TC|5.0|Very good practical book providing options for various scenarios that can happen in real projects. Can be a very good reference book if you are into agile
B003JQLHY0|5.0|Great looking watch...study and dependable.  I like the continuous sweep second hand and the durability of the watch.  I was in California recently and several of my friends were wearing them so I just had to have one and I am glad I purchased it!!!
038533348X|5.0|A book written 50 years ago Cats cradle.(I read a  teenager, maybe now she'll now why we say &#34; spreads like Ice Nine&#34;). She also received the Beatles  Please Please Me, 2nd season of I love Lucy,  From Russia with Love & a Lava lamp among other things. This gift basket was a big hit.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Don't force me too type too many words.<br />Excellent CD. I love it!<br /><br />8 more words required... &#34;In Al Din Babour Al Jabak&#34; (don't ask me for translation) :)
B0025KVLRO|5.0|I made of a gift basket of things produced in 1963 for a great friends 50th birthday. Please Please Me by the Beatles for music, From Russia with Love for a movie , I Love Lucy 2nd season TV show (also her favorite reruns) Cats Cradle for reading (now she may stop giving us funny looks when we say &#34;spreading like Ice Nine.) also a Lava Lamp and many small things.  This gift basket was a happy hit with every one.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I always lowed this movie bought it on VHS when came out first still have it but the tape got old and deteriorated. Then I find it on Amazon in Blue Ray DVD. bought  imminently their is no compression the DVD in Blue Ray is amazing picture and sound is fantastic. A must have it!!!
B0011EU0NG|4.0|We watched this movie with our kids when they were 6 or 8, now they are 39 and 44, we just watched it with two of our Grand kids now 6 and 9, they rated it with 4 stars, the youngest one pointed out that there was a lot of singing in it ! We all enjoyed it.
B00F2NOPFG|5.0|Great Edition of this movie!! As fan you need to have it! Steelbook and a scale ship it's all I need!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Originally bought my fiancee a kindle fire hd and she used the charger for her galaxy s3. It charged the phone completely in about 80mins. My phone charger broke so I purchased this and have been using it everywhere I go. Amazing charger and great for use outside of the kindle

0744014956|5.0|bought this book much less than gamestop had. this book has everything you need for the game except the online. wish they would of put things in it for the online play.
B00E1LT41K|5.0|This miniseries is that adaptation of the three historical FICTION books, The White Queen, The Red Queen, + The Kingmaker's Daughter.  Be aware, it is FICTION and there are a lot of inaccuracies against historical fact.  It's based on the War of the Roses.<br /><br />If you can suspend belief, and just watch it as a beautiful medieval mini-series (facts be damned!) it's very, very good. Lies, betrayal, death, sex, glorious costumes, good actors & actresses and more.  If you loved Camelot, you'll love this!<br /><br />However, if you're a stickler for historical accuracy, then pass on this. Since I'm not a stickler for accuracy, I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />Breathtaking costuming & sets. I just loved it, and plan on buying the miniseries.
B009NY43NY|5.0|It was a good book, I only would have had Sookie end up with someone else, like maybe Eric Northmam.
1623650003|5.0|I really loved the book because right from the start the plot was intriguing. A girl got kidnapped but nobody was looking for her. Who was she? Why was she held against her will. You don't get an answer until the very end because in between you think you do but in fact you don't. Unless you are ready to spend sleepless nights finishing the book don't start reading.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Pratchett at his best. Vimes and company race through the country and river chasing bad guys, justice, and bacon sandwiches all in the name of the law (and the search of poo).<br />Highly recommend this to any fans of puns and laughter, with a side of social satire.
B00FPH51LQ|2.0|I should have waited till it was available for rent.  Oh well got a movie in my arsenal that my kid likes at least.<br /><br />Based on the actors and trailers I totally thought this movie was going to rock.  But it not only didn't rock it was like watching a weird version of MIB.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I can accept any premise in a movie as long as it remains internally consistent; this does not.  Action moves forward on the say-so of writer's whims, not the needs of characters.  Illogical and clichéd.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the s*&iexcl;t! One of the most addicting games out there! I've even stopped smoking crack to enjoy this game :)!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Engaging plot (s) and a wide variety of characters keep me reading voraciously!  Am into the 4th book now and will definitely order the 5th.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is such a great app.The graphics are AMAZING.You have many guns to choose from and many upgrades.I dont know how it could be better except hunting multiplayer.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Shipped Fast. Excellent Condition. We've watched all seasons so far on HBO. Bought seasons 1 and 2 and looking forward to buying season 3.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This novel has been adapted to movies three times and is the inspiration for every zombie movie,video game,comic and television series since the release of Night Of the Living Dead.<br />The book is far superior to any of those other variations of the same story.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|this show keeps getting better and better with each season, highly recommended, get this for your collection, well worth the<br />money.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It is fun to play but if you exit the app any hints used on a clue are wasted. Still, it is a good way to spend time.
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|After Earth is science fiction action adventure film directed by M. Night Shyamalan about a military father (Will Smith) and his teenage son (Jadon Smith) crash land on Earth one thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity to abandon Earth for a new home planet. The son must save his dying father and himself by trekking alone across hostile terrain pursued by evolved predators and an alien beast to recover a rescue-beacon.<br /><br />After hearing about all the bad reviews and this movie tanking at the theater, I didn't have high expectations of this movie. With that being said, this movie was better than I expected, which isn't saying a lot as I still think the movie was not that great.<br /><br />The movie was slow and dull and moved along like a duck stuck in the mud. The action was sparing and mostly dumb with a giant eagle and some animals that looked like they belonged in the zoo as opposed to being some villainous animals. Even the Usar or whatever they called it was a poorly conceived computer generated creature. There are no weapons or suits that could defend against this creature?? Seriously?? Add on some nonsensical weather just to top it off as well that is never explained and an alien war that is also left unexplained.<br /><br />The acting was some of the worst I have seen from not only Jaden Smith (which I expected) but also Will Smith which surprises me. I normally like most of Will Smith's movies with &#34;I am Legend&#34; being one of my favorites but it almost seemed that Will Smith was trying to find his inner Laurence Fishbourne slash Matrix impression with his monotone lack of emotion almost reading of his lines acting. But his acting wasn't as bad as his son's who was not believable in the role and surprisingly enough had no chemistry with his own father in the movie. I can understand that Will Smith was trying to promote his son's acting career but Please please please, Mr. Smith do not do any more movies that include you and your son. Jaden Smith is not ready for prime time as a main character and should try perfecting his craft in smaller roles outside of his father's limelight and this movie idea brought to life by M Night was not a way to do it.<br /><br />The positives about the movie is that the scenery in the movie was pretty and had nice scenic locations and the special effects were decent with the exception of the poorly conceived monster. And I get the message that the movie was trying to send in the father son relationship which accounts for 2 stars as opposed to one. But by the time the movie ended, I didn't care about the characters as they were poorly developed and lacked any emotion. Nor did I care what happened at the conclusion by the time I got to the end.<br /><br />A shame though as this could have had a lot of potential but M. Night and Smith blew it on this one. Do yourself a favor and pay attention to the bad reviews, you may wish you had.son.

B008Y7ED5O|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!  The sets and costumes were wonderfully detailed.  Acting was well done and the movie was pretty accurate with events and people. I highly recommend this movie.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to read love it very easy to read when read to my grand babies thank you for making it so plain
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|I just picked up a Billboard magazine after searching for a long time and my question is, how did TAKE BACK THE NIGHT, NOT go to number 1 on the pop charts. It's the hottest song out, period. Anyway, this cd is party and play. Love the fact that JT could come out with back to back cd's just like recording artist of yesteryear did. Why wait 5 plus years in between projects. I can't wait to see him perform these songs in concert.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is a fun game and I highly recommend it. The shipment came in good condition and we enjoyed playing the game.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Really loved this show. Obviously, there won't be a season 3. Too bad, because the acting was amazing. The super-imposed graphics were a treat, too.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I was hooked with the first chapter of the book and liked the way and unbelievable moment of marriage at first sight was developed. I had a bit of problem with the pacing of the last 3rd of the book, in part because i felt the conflict was drawn out too much - perhaps because the heroes motivation for that conflict at the end wasn't developed enough earlier in the story for me.  We understand earlier all of Megan's fears about relationships and marriage but only introduced to Connor's relationship issue toward the end.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Better than ever in HD.  You get a much clearer view of the &#34;Great&#34; technology of the time.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An excellent written book about a truly insprational story about two pilots  an American bomber pilot and a German fighter pilot who saved his life.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Always a great satire no matter how may time you see it.  A must for any collection or Kubrick enthusiast!!
B002N4DYZO|3.0|It cannot be denied that this recording has the best cast on paper, but this recording is so darn boring? Why because of the sluggish, overly-romantic, dull and drama-free conducting of Klemperer. If all you care about is great singing, this is the set to get. If you want a great representation of a great work, go with Bernstein's recording. That boosts an excellent cast, with the most excellent conducting and playing by the Vienna Philharmonic. Some say Fidelio is only a great opera because it bears Beethoven's name. Klemperer's reading only helps to back up that claim, Bernstein's completely thwarts it.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Interesting story with good characters and goo plot twists. Easy read all the way to the end to find out what happens.
B000OVLBHG|3.0|A group of high school friends (Caspar Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, and Neil Patrick Harris) enlist in the military and pursue their careers against the backdrop of mankind’s war with an alien race.<br /><br />This film works best as sheer spectacle and it is easy to get swept up in its impressive action sequences.  There are also some fun pokes at fascism, mostly in the occasional news reports and recruiting commercials that punctuate the action.  However, director Paul Verhoeven and his crew seem as if they want to both have and eat their cake, as the film fetishizes militarism more effectively than it undercuts it.  Still fun, though.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|This is definitely the best pool game on the market, I love it it's just like the PC version, definitely 5 stars
1476727651|1.0|This book started out great, but when he describes them sadistically torturing a child, I had to bail out. Sorry, but I don't want that in my head. The one scene was bad enough and I'm sure there's more (and worse) to come.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing game guys. It connects to Facebook so you can challenge your friends and family. I say it is AMAZING. Yes, it deserves all CAPS! Have Fun!!!!! I know I will.

B003XVYLDU|2.0|Glad this was not on my HS reading list. Did not make sense to me. Not something I would recommend.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Good movie, enjoyed it all the way to the end. Can not wait until the next avengers movie comes out .
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|It is an awesome dj fan  and I love it is cool to make your own mixes and I love to make up new songs to.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|AMAZING IN THE WORLD OF READING MATERIAL.<br />IT'S GOT SO MUCH THOUGHT AND JUST AMAZING. THAT IS THE ONLY WORD.
B0037HOWKM|5.0|My son loves Minecraft and this castle reminded him of one he saw on YouTube so I bought it for his 11th birthday. At first he was daunted by the number of pieces,over 500! But once he started he was fascinated with the challenge and the design.<br /><br />I didn't realize the age recommendation was 18+.... guess it depends more on the individual.<br /><br />Now that I see you can buy block sets in various colors to design and create your own projects, I will be buying more!<br /><br />Thank you for a great product!!
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Great for Adults and children. Laughed through out the whole movie!! Kept me interested in what was coming next !!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|It's interesting reading about a book about the near future (say five or seven years) which really seems to be the way things are heading; a place where you are encouraged to quickly respond to every superficial posting made by a member of your work team, coworker on a different team, a client, a customer, and pretty much everybody. It is a big brother kind of company.<br /><br />That said, there are a couple of unrealistic things about the book. For one, at about the 15% location of the ebook she gets into a relationship with one of her coworkers. That does not happen in 2013, and likely will not happen in 2020. Workers, especially at known companies, are asexualized and frightened of confronting the opposite sex with anything smacking of flirtatiousness. The method of socializing romantically nowadays is online dating web sites.<br /><br />The other thing is the salary. In the year 2020 Mae Holland's parents brag about how her daughter makes 60,000$ a year (she makes 62K starting). In the year 2000 even B students could get programming jobs for about that much, even for unknown companies. I think the starting salary at Facebook and Google is far higher. I'd think that the starting salary for someone who works in the year 2020 at one of the world's best known and successful and elite and selective companies would be, given seven years of inflation from now, around $225,000 per year.<br /><br />Aside from shallow characters and unrealistic elements of the plot, it's a chilling tale of what actually seems to be happening right now.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Quite the story. Some gripping moments and some very heartfelt moments exploring the universal struggle of coming to grips with a parents legacy. It's an easy read but a story that resonates.
B00EJB44VW|3.0|It was interesting to find that the author did  not really investigate then question of whether Jesus really existed or was a symbolic character.  He quotes Josephus as proof of Jesus being real but only in the notes at the back of the book does he accept that these entries were known to be interpolations. He also accepts many of the statements credited to Jesus were actually made by him, totally ignoring the research of Tom Harpur in his book &#34;The Pagan Christ&#34;who found most of them were made by the Egyptian God man Horus two and a half millennia before Jesus was allegedly born.<br /><br />Still, an interesting read but needs to be taken with a grain of salt as if his assumption that Jesus was a historical figure is false his whole argument fails.
B0054TVW04|5.0|The proper study of Mankind is Man.<br />Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,<br />A Being darkly wise<br /><br />  A good look at an incomprehensible subject.  Lots of references, books to look at later.... Definitely worth having. He's given me a much better understanding of  Burke, Hobbes, and Locke. I could never keep them straight.<br /><br />But not perfect on my Paperwhite Kindle.  I kinda got lost somewhere in the middle and never found my way back... I'll try it on my iPad and see if it works better.  Kindle Paperwhite  is wonderful ...hope they keep making it better<br /><br />I tried the book on my ancient iPad....  Much, much better.  I'll do my Kindle reading on the iPad now around the house.  On the pane or in the park.... Kindle.  Kindle Paperwhite just falls short on maps and charts or any unusual formatting.
B0089LOG02|3.0|Christina Kline should  be commended for her thorough research on the orphan trains which distributed unfortunate children to homes throughout the midwest in the early 20th century. This particular novel features two lonely women, ninety one year old orphan train survivor, Vivian and seventeen year old Molly, not yet emancipated from the current foster care system.  Vivian's backstory as an orphan train rider and her brutal existence in depression era Minnesota and Molly's story of bouncing around in various foster care homes catalogue a series of deprivations and degradations which most of us will never experience.<br />This novel is captivating and  one I would especially suggest to those who cannot imagine life without the conveniences of daily life. An excellent book for teens and twenty somethings.  For me it was not a great book, but one that I enjoyed as a quick read.
006135323X|3.0|First, the positives.  Ariely is an incredibly engaging writer, taking complex ideas and making them both accessible and interesting.  He also highlights several important factors affecting human behavior.  His two chapters on social norms and his two chapters on honesty and its connection to monetary transactions did lead me to think about things in a new way.  As someone who has read a fair amount on behavioral economics, that is not faint praise.<br /><br />However, he is obsessed with the strawman of mainstream economics when I am guessing that most \\"mainstream economists\\" are well aware of most of the irrationalities he describes.  In fact the most basic economic theories are quite agnostic as to where preferences come from and care only about how they are revealed.  So we act different when something is \\"free\\", and don't always trust offers from companies?  Those sentiments arguably aren't irrational and in any case, they do little to compromise basic economic theory.<br /><br />Much of his policy prescriptions appear to be hopes that people and corporations behave better.  Companies should build up morale among their workforces and not try to mislead consumers.  OK, that would be nice.  But maybe he should acknowledge the mainstream economic reaction to this, if it worked, more companies would do it. Firms if anything are too rational, we would be better served if they weren't.<br /><br />Finally, literally every one of Ariely conclusions are based upon experiments.  The experiments are fun to read about but they leave serious doubts about the generalizability.  Experiments are not the real world.  They are tightly controlled scenarios that may or may not mimic the real world.  He seems to give a lot of thought to mimicking well but at the end of the day some cautions from him in extrapolating the results would be appreciated.  At best, he has demonstrated that his conclusions apply to wealthy upper-middle class kids that inhabit elite colleges.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great series!!! Can't wait to watch the rest of season and season two! Keeps you on the edge of your chair.

B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I got so many popup ads to rate the product, upgrade to full version, download companion apps, and other distractions that I gave up on this app.  It might have nice features and be helpful but the incessant nagging was just too much to tolerate.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Although this is a docudrama, it's still a great story of the last emperor of China, I highly recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is probably the best app ever, and it's FREE! the only app that comes close is minecraft, but it is not free
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|After the drek of Under the Dome and the prior annual string of disappointing novels I wasn't sure how (or if) Mr. King still had enough of the Shining left in himself to do justice to a sequel to his classic -- I was wrong this was an excellent story!!
1451696191|5.0|great movie with a great story line. Definately worth watching. However i hate these reviews that require you to write a specific amount I think thats bull
1781162646|3.0|As an avid King reader, I had to buy it.  But it's not your classic \\"horror and or fantasy\\" King.<br /><br />It was an easy read and well written, but at the end or in between, there was no meat. I hate to say it, but it was bland and there was nothing to grab onto at the end or anywhere else.<br /><br />Sorry folks, get it at the library so you can return it after reading.
B00AFEY354|5.0|great book with a great story line. Love this book , Definately worth reading ,however i hate these reviews that require you to write a specific amount I think thats bull
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Keep eating....this is more addictive than potato chips...I don't know how many times I said, just one more game. the graphics are beautiful - (spoiler alert) I love how the remaining people tremble when you take one of their companions out. it is fun - wish I could make the games last longer but I am getting more and more into being the hungry shark so more risk...highly recommend - its fun.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app. Really helpful with info re battery and charging nothing more to say.It does what it says on tin.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I was tempted to give this book 3 stars, but it is so much better than that - a five star book, except for the end.  I cannot stand a book that doesn't have a clear ending.  I think I may be in the minority, but when I read the book I want the author to tell me what happens, I want a satisfying conclusion.  That doesn't happen in the Giver.  I know if I re read the other 3 books in the series, I'll find the conclusion I was looking for, but that isn't alluded to at the end of the Giver.  Oh well.<br /><br />Jonas is about to receive his assignment along with all the other kids his age, 12.  Children at 12 find out what career they'll train for.  This is a dystopian society where everything is the same, families are created simply for the purpose of raising children, but not your own children, only some girls are selected to be birth mothers, children go to the Nurturing Center, and if they do not thrive according to society's standards, or if you're a twin and the weaker, lighter etc...then you're \\"released\\" or euthanized.<br /><br />Jonas is selected to be the new Receiver of Memory.  The former Receiver is now the Giver, and through touch, he gives Jonas all of the memories that the society doesn't have anymore, war, famine, happiness, love, warmth, cold, and color.<br /><br />It's an interesting society, and Jonas decides to escape, with the help of the Giver (whose future isn't settled in the book either),  in order to save a child who will be released.
B0060CXSR4|5.0|My daughter loves it...they sing a LOT.  Be prepared to have songs stuck in your head forever and they aren't energetic songs, they are calming, make you sleepy songs.  Which is awesome...except I'm pretty sure children are immune to the calm sleepiness of songs until they are older.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|It is a great product, works out great. makes a great protector. easy to carry the kindle in your baggage or purse
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I got the game because I seen a friend playing it. but now me and my daughter can't stop playing it. WE LOVE IT !
B004EBT5CU|4.0|SHE IS BLESSED WITH A VOICE THAT CAN PROBABLY SING ANYTHING- OR AS RANDY JACKSON LIKES TO SAY- SHE COULD SANG THE PHONEBOOK  AND MAKE EVERYONE WANT TO GO BUY A COPY.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Dev Patel holds his own with this veteran cast.  Loved the sights and sounds of India, and how each Brit reacted to it.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR THAT SOMEONE SO YOUNG SHOULD BE SUCH A TALENTED SINGER/SONGWRITER.  MY 7 YR OLD NIECE AND I THOROUGHLY ENJOY SINGING AND DANCING ALONG WITH MS. SWIFT.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is a book that i will read over and over again. This book is so grounding and it reinforced the true fundamentals of life. It is written in a simple and somewhat raw manner which makes the story line the true hero. Have recommended it to my family and friends, who also loved it.
B004BCT2HU|4.0|IF YOU GREW UP LISTENING TO HARD ROCK AND HEAVY METAL LIKE I DID, IT'S KIND OF COOL TO HEAR THESE SONGS PLAYED ON THE VIOLIN.
B00DEFW8YY|5.0|I have to recommend these two discs by probably the most talented pianist interpreter of our time.<br />Please listen it! Nobody before Helen Grimaud was able to restitute so perfectly all the poetry and passion of Brahms when he is a young man, lover of Carla Schumann; and then the melancoly, tenderness and meditation of the older Brahms.<br />Helen's playing is unique: subtle, nuanced, profound, inspired ... and her amazing sense of rubato!<br />Two discs unforgettable.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed these books so much!  The ending brought tears to my eyes. 'Real'.  I will miss Katniss and Peeta
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|A must-watch for fans of science fiction, or solid storytelling in general.  This is what all TV shows should be.
B00BIR381W|5.0|Think it'll come on time&#62; LOL LOL LLLROFL  Don't male a promise you don't intend to keep.  I feel cheated.
B00821OX98|5.0|Started watching this series believing I would hate it like all the other space alien shows out there. I was instantly drawn to this show and ended up watching all three seasons back to back and can't wait till season four comes out. Loved this show.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Loved it.. Really well done.  Can't wait for season 3. Gets really good.  Shocking twist on season 2. Must watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is great it updates every month and gives you all types of ways to explore all around the world. Its so fun and its like 123
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Great &#34;match and remove&#34; game with plenty of bonus moves available.<br />Simple and easy to play.  Very nice graphics and sounds.
B000W9399S|2.0|I've never read anything like it, and I did not like it. It literally made me feel funny when reading it.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|thought this would work with my h.p. printer. Will not print pictures from my Kindle to my printer,I would have to drive 26 miles away to a UPS store to pick up my picture. I haven't tried to print a document ,I would properly have to cross two States to retrieve them. Totally useless app.
B004EPYZOY|4.0|If you're a fan of Cage and good b-movies definitely go for it. If not, it is a \\"genre flick\\", but I still recommend it for a bit of enjoyable distraction. It's solid throwaway entertainment and I think everyone knows that. William Fichtner is a lot of fun in this, a lot; he's becoming more than just a welcomed face in the movies I've screened, he's becoming a name I look forward to seeing on the one sheet and a good reason to buy a ticket and spend the time. I can't wait for Cage to take care of what he needs to take care of and get fully back in the saddle. Him and William reunited in a big budget extravaganza would be a great way to cool off on a hot summer day.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved the way the story kept taking turns, leaving you guessing. One minute you hate Gideon the next you are in love again.
B000002KMV|5.0|At his best , early Prince innovating and risqué , This CD (Album ) is ground breaking ! Highly recommend This CD , with explicit lyrics of course.
B00COO2D6O|1.0|I updated this and now nothing loads.  It worked fine before that. If they can't fix it, I want my money back.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|There is something almost spiritual in reading the diary of this very wise, very young girl who, for lack of a better word, vanished with millions of others in the Holocaust. Through her words she lives on, documenting the years in hiding and her thoughts as she matured. I first read this in grade school, from an abridged edition, and the book has haunted me for years. It's not an easy read, knowing her ultimate fate, but it's an important one. Anyone who comes away from reading this book without empathy, understanding and compassion is either a sociopath, a Nazi, or both.
B000MCIBAW|3.0|The Doors were great in their day and I used to listen to them on vinyl.  Unfortunately, due to the poor sampling rate of<br />this digital recording, the sound came out Flat and woody.  Very disappointing as I know there was a lot of subtle background music that was not to be heard.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Awesome book!.  This book has a lot of action and mystery to it. I don't want to put it down. My grandson loves it too! We are looking forward to reading the next book in this series.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|...Captivated by You was available right NOW, but it's not. I'm enthralled by the story of Gideon and Eva. It's like a fairytale come true, even with all the horrible issues they face. I won't be one to complain about a non-ending and a wait for the fourth book, because Sylvia Day's novels are FULL books, not at all like the recent trend of worthless 54-page short stories calling themselves books, when really they're just badly-written teasers to try and empty your pockets. I'm thrilled at the idea of spending more of my money on quality writing, knowing that it's going to Sylvia and her amazing support team. Write on, Sylvia! Reward my heart and mind with more of your brilliant words!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|On my second reading. Isaacson's attention to detail and diligence of interviewing Job's associates provides an unvarnished study<br /> of Job's character.

B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet, filmed in EastmanColor and CinemaScope was given the \\"A\\" picture treatment by MGM, which borrowed some animators from Disney studios to help with the special effects. The special effects are great, but the sets and costuming are lavish, creative, beautiful, and show that \\"MGM touch\\" - which had never before been seen in a sci-film. However, one special effect deserves a comment: The \\"DC\\" stations used by the crew to safely decelerate from hyperdrive lightspeed will make you think your looking at the transporter room on Star Trek. Surely, this is where Gene Roddenberry got the idea for his famous \\"beam me up, Scotty\\" special effect.<br /><br />The story takes place on the distant planet Altair which was once home to the scientifically advanced Krell. As the story unfolds, we learn about their advanced technology, which is self-servicing and still operational - and we discover what happened to the Krell. This isn't post-war propaganda about a nuclear apocalypse or alien invaders, but it does investigate the inability of human beings to responsibly use advanced technology. Hint: Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud would have loved this plot!<br /><br />One of the less believable aspects of the film is that, according to Dr. Morbius, \\"The shape of the (extent) Krell doorways indicate the physical shape of the Krell, like doorways on Earth would give us an idea of the shape of human beings.\\" By this standard, the Krell must've had the basic dimensions of Jabba the Hutt - but, we're told the gravity on Altair is slightly less than the gravity on Earth, so we would expect the Krell to be taller than humans, not wider.<br /><br />All of the actors are well cast and the acting is far better than most sci-fi films. Anne Francis, while not a great actor, steals the show. She was born to play the educated, but naive Altaira, who is totally unaware of her own sexuality and the effect it might have on men. She thinks that because Captain Adams turns his back when she gets out of a swimming hole scantily clad, that he doesn't like her of find her attractive.<br /><br />Robby The Robot gives Anne Francis some competition since he first appears in The Forbidden Planet and goes on to an illustrious career in over 25 films and TV series. Robby is certainly the most successful robot actor on film.<br /><br />Disney's The Black Hole, which I believe to be one of the most beautiful sci-fi films ever made, pays homage to Forbidden Planet. The next time you watch The Black Hole, think of the tour Morbius gives to Captain Adams and the view looking up and down the 150 or so stories in the underground Krell power plant. (Please don't bother to attack me because I like The Black Hole. I am fully aware that many people simply bypass the gorgeous cinematography and art direction in The Black Hole and go directly into nuclear attack mode claiming The Black Hole to be one of the worst films ever made.)<br /><br />While, some of the special effects may look cheesy by today's standards, taken as a whole, Forbidden Planet remains a great and highly entertaining sci-fi film.

B000RO9VJK|5.0|I think that this book should be required reading in high schools so our youth can be equipped with the tools to succeed in starting their own businesses. It should also be required reading and tested upon prior to anyone being allow to start their own business. This book forces us to take a good hard look at our selves and the businesses we should be building to change the world in which we live.
0553801473|5.0|Enjoyed the book, I think it was a good addition to the series and helps to advance the story line. Additionally, it arrived in a timely manner from Amazon, so thank you Amazon :)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Excellent suspense/sci-fi worth watching if you are a fan of either genre. Great actors and great story equals great entertainment.
0439023513|4.0|My preteen son enjoyed the whole series and was happy with the way the it ended in this final book. I read the series too and enjoyed it as well. The storyline of these books opened up some great discussions in our home.
0345511468|5.0|I have all the other &#34;Making of&#34; books by J.W. Rinzler and he does a great job with them.  ROTJ is outstanding.  I received it and went page by page through it for hours.  I definitely recommend this and all the other books for serious, die-hard Star Wars fans.  Amazon did a great job packaging the book and it arrived in Mint condition.  Thanks, AMAZON!  Buy this book!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Like reading stories of Japan, the Afghans are an alien race, it cannot but compel you to read of them. Khaled writes, warts and all, of the Afghans, yet he writes with such insight one cannot help but admire them as a race of people.  Sure what is newsworthy today is mostly the dark side of the Afghan but Khaled's work always shows balance.  We get to meet the brave, the honourable, the cultured, the compassionate Afghans, the ones that one can admire and love. Again we meet them in &#34;And the mountains Echoed&#34; and are not left wanting.
B00C68JXAW|5.0|I am extremely happy with this purchase.  Not only did I get a hard to find movie, but I got it at a very great price from this company.  My family and I watched it and we all thought it was great.  I would definitely buy from this company again!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the book. Couldn't put it down. What I liked most about it was all the explicit sex.<br />I would recommend this book to all women. I don't think it's a book for men. It's a chick book.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Very good I would watch it just because its Star Trek, but even through it was well done it is a bit like the first one!

0802473156|5.0|Great book!  Talk about an 'aha!' moment: this book really provided it.  I grew up in a family where compliments conveyed interest and caring.<br /><br />Buying someone a gift was a social convention.  Helping someone with a task was a responsibility.  But paying someone a compliment said &#34;I'm paying attention to you.  I'm interested in you.  I care about you.&#34;  It never occurred to me that my interpretation was not universal.  As I said, it was an 'aha!' moment.<br /><br />This book, when combined with &#34;The Seven Levels of Intimacy&#34; by Matthew Kelly, provides a powerful insight into why people fail to connect, why connections never become relationships, and why relationships dissolve.  It provides a way of understanding the language through which others are trying to tell us they care.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I just wish the full version was free:( I can't stop playing it! I don't like how they only have a certain amount of time to play it on
0875847706|5.0|If I had to choose the three, most powerful books I have ever read (and I have read a small library full), \\"The Art of Possibility\\" would be one of those three.  It is transformational.<br /><br />The message, beautifully communicated, is that our perceptions of life are a construct of our minds.  And those perceptions quite often severely limit our lives.  But the authors also provide a pathway for stepping outside those limits and looking at life in a fresh and objective way.<br /><br />The common thread of those who have achieved great things is the willingness to look at things in a different way, a willingness to step outside the box.  That, of course, means stepping into the unknown.  For those who prefer the safety and the security that exists inside the box, that is a step not easily taken.<br /><br />For those who seek a greater truth, a truer truth, however, the world outside the box is a fascinating place.  \\"The Art of Possibility\\" is the guidebook for those who would travel to that brave, new world.
1611761808|2.0|Although I enjoyed the story (not as much as the first two), I was dragged down listening to this on audio.  I usually listen to my books during my commute to work and it makes the ride go by quickly and enjoyably.  However, the author chose non-native English speakers to narrate this book and it took WAY too much work to decipher what they were trying to say.  The man had a heavy accent and the woman less so.  But, even after I got used to their accents, the non-native speakers have a way of putting stress on  the wrong syllable or word in a phrase which can entirely change the meaning.  For example, a sentence can be read,\\" I don't know WHAT he was doing\\" or \\"I don't know what HE was doing\\".  Each has a different meaning in relation to the story.  Often during the reading I was left to wonder what the reader meant and was thinking about it and missed the narrative of what came next.  WAY too distracting to listen to an audiobook this way!
B003498SDA|4.0|Why Tom Cruise doesn't play the villain more often, I don't know.  His chemistry with Jamie Fox was comical at times.  One of his better films.  Just wish he would play the bad guy more often.
B009POHHRG|3.0|I enjoyed the story all the way up to the last page. The ending was very disappointing. I will not be reading this again.
B004RQVVGU|5.0|The 2011 Legacy Edition is excellent, and a 1000% improvement over the 2002 disaster of a remaster/remix.  This edition is not to be confused with the negative posts on this album.  Buy this with confidence.
B00FQRWORE|5.0|I thought the first books by author DC Rogers, most notably 'The Wolfman Chronicles' [[ASIN:B00EUCLL66 Wolfman Chronicles: A Hero in Fur, Part2: Deacanus Vampire]] showed a lot of promise and am glad to report that his first full-length effort \\"Free Spirit: Heart and Soul\\" does not disappoint. The story is a medley of Western and Fantasy and its a potent combination that makes for a fun, entertaining read. There are some good historical details and overall the prose is crisp and authentic-sounding. Recommended.
B004DL5K2K|5.0|There are many reviews that are negative for the remaster.  This Expanded Edition is from 2011.  The sound quality with the original member is excellent.  Do not confuse this with the 2002, which the majority of the reviews are for.  Buy this with confidence.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Admitting that I purchased this somewhat impulsively, and did not do my homework at all, I was a little disappointed to find that certain file types and that certain Web based video are not supported, If this is a concern for you, then be sure to investigate first. Otherwise, overall, still a pretty slick little device.

B004J4WKTW|2.0|Generally speaking, I'm not fond of &#34;make-believe&#34; & science fiction, & this fits in that genre; the human stories were interesting, however.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|worth the watch.  left room for a sequel or maybe a series like the living dead.  finally give that show some competition.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is one of the most outstanding series out there. Encompassing virtually all of the elements which grab your attention and keep your riveted. The fact that the &#34;Bad Guy&#34; is also in many ways a &#34;Good Guy&#34; adds an interesting facet to the rapidly developing story line.  Extremely well done and interesting series.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love love love this game.  It is challenging and fun.  What a way to keep you on your toes.  Even the optional games that come with it are just as good.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Great action movie.  Important to keep in mind while watching, that it is based on a comic book story and the movie stays true to that genre. So don't expect realism or things to make sense, just enjoy the action for what it is and keep in mind you are watching a very good comic book come to life. Casting was outstanding.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The package came on time and was just what I ordered. Fit my kindle fine --very light weight No problems at all
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Outstanding movie.  Anyone familiar with the original series and the follow up series will be blown away.  The casting is uncanny and without equal in any movie or show I've ever seen. Every character is superb. These two newest Star Trek movies have been fantastic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's just like having your own horse and farm.Groom your horse,Judd the stall even ride your horse.It's a great game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I repeatedly imagined the movie-how the flash backs would be handled.  Reminiscent of The Good Son and  The Bad Seed.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Make sure you have a 3D compatible TV as Blu-ray player, and this will be an amazing movie to watch!
B004RKXN44|5.0|Perfect addition to the series. I was looking forward to Hawk and Sienna story and this book did not disappoint.
B000SINT52|5.0|This is a good check on the government's point of view.  It's also entertaining.  I liked the special features because they looked at specific topics more in depth.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|When the fifth season became available I knew I had to watch from the beginning again! What a treat! There's nothing like watching 5 seasons from start to finish, without commercial interruption.
145162607X|5.0|wonderful, wonderful wonderful.  I am so glad I don't live in this time period.  it's shocking to see the value of a woman placed so low.
B00BEIYM42|5.0|Unfinished Song is so Good ! Vanessa Redgrave and Terence Stamp star as a coouple who are total opposites. If you loved Quartet with Maggie Smith, this is another treat for you. The rare film that has all the actors giving their best efforts. So glad this has been released on dvd, as our local theatres have not run it here.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|I didn't know much about this movie before we rented it.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Our whole family enjoyed it.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It's okay, but I'm still waiting for Candy Crush Saga to be available for my Kindle.  Can't understand why it isn't already.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|I remember buying this record when i was about 16 years old...couldn't believe it came out so close to Experienced...with no fanfare, advance notice, nothing, at least in the info circles a 16 year old suburbanite had in 1968...complete surprise.  Also remember seeing JH live for the 1st time a couple weeks after getting the album, everyone was wondering if he'd play anything off Axis, but it was all Experienced with Red House & Wild Thing added of course.<br /><br />It seems more appropriate to just reminisce on what this release has meant for 45 years rather than actually rate it.  If you like JH at all, it's a 5 star release...after all, there are just some constants in the universe...settled science!
B00CJGP116|5.0|i would let everyone to buy it now!!! it's great from the beginning to the end of the CD!!!<br />CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT!
B002LVVCQM|5.0|It's about time someone pushed the 'theory' of evolution to it's rightful place, as an undeniable fact.  This one will not sit well with creationists, but it's time to step into reality anyway.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Love...love..love this movie. The ultimate end to an awesome trilogy. Very awesome graphics as well as the all star cast make this movie one not to miss.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|Absolute amazing movie, kept you on the edge of your seat. Decent plot and story line. I would recommend this for all sci fiction people out there.
B00ESB75FA|5.0|I haven't liked a sitcom this much since &#34;Friends&#34;!  I recommend starting from Season 1, because you get to know the characters, see them grow (both the characters as well as the actors who play them), and they constantly reference things from past shows. If I'm having a bad day, I put HIMYM on and I'm instantly in a great mood, and always LOL!!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I got this app a while ago, and thought that it needed a review. This app is great, I have no problems, except maybe the ads. And on regular YouTube, it gives you new videos each time, but on this app, it doesn't. That's all, I hope you like it as much as I do.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT, Does the job.  Dont beat 2 stones and oil.  But it gets the job done.  But it takes a little work to get used to such a small item.  Id buy 4 more just in case.  Worth every penny in $8.64

B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|[...]<br /><br />I think it's no big secret that I am absolutely in love with Brandon Sanderson's books. Ever since I read the first book of the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\", \\"The Final Empire\\", I knew that the most beautiful fangirl love was blossoming within me (yes, my love knows no bounds, even if it calls for flowery language). I eagerly lapped up \\"The Rithmatist\\" and \\"The Way of Kings\\", and nearly fell out of my seat when I discovered that Mr. Sanderson was releasing a new YA book last month! I might have even kissed the floor and cried a little. But I digress.<br /><br />It is now 10 A.C., a whole decade after Calamity came. When a huge burst in the sky erupted and gave select men and women extraordinary powers, the people were in awe. What they didn't know was that these Epics are no friend of man. With incredible powers comes the incredible urge to dominate, even if it means oppression and murder--including that of David's father. David is out for vengeance ever since he saw Steelheart, the most powerful of all Epics, ruthlessly massacre everyone in a bank--everyone but him. But nobody fights the Epics, nobody except for the Reckoners, a shadowy group of ordinary humans bent on assassinating Epics. David wants in. He has something they need, knowledge no one else has. He's seen the invincible Steelheart bleed. And he wants revenge.<br /><br />One of the (many) things I love about Mr. Sanderson's novels is the incredible world-building that goes on in each and every one of them. Every series has its own unique universe, whether it's the mysterious world of Allomancy or the magical, almost Harry Potter-esque world of Rithmatics. In \\"Steelheart\\", Mr. Sanderson concocts a dystopian period in which Epics maintain a tight control over their domains. To me, Epics are kind of like superheroes. Or I guess they're more like supervillains. Their powers are pretty awesome, like moving the earth and creating illusions. But what makes Mr. Sanderson's worlds that amazing is that they involve a certain degree of complexity in them, like in the way every Epic's powers can be organized into categories. It seems like Mr. Sanderson definitely likes organization--looking back, there are always hierarchies and sub-levels and such in all of the worlds he builds! It adds extra oomph and dimension into the story, and it's just mind-blowing how such intricate worlds can pop out from someone's head like that.<br /><br />The same can be said about Mr. Sanderson's characters, and especially about his protagonists! His main characters always go through some intense and believable development throughout the course of the story, and it's always so interesting to see them grow with each obstacle they encounter. David, to me, is a pretty exciting character to follow in \\"Steelheart\\", but I think I'm going to have to say that I didn't love him as much as I did his other protagonists. Don't get me wrong, David's incredibly clever (just don't call him a nerd), determined and brave--all qualities any great hero should have. But I just felt as if I never reached that point of true connection with him, like I did with Vin from the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\". I think this feeling arises from the impression I got while reading the book that Mr. Sanderson was trying a little too hard to make him into a goofy, yet likable and strong character. For instance, there were many times when David would use a really bad metaphor then go on to talk about how bad he was at making metaphors. It's a definite quirk, but I felt like it was a little too forced and too awkward. The same can be said about his crush on Megan. Having said all this, I may be being a little bit too harsh, since I'm probably comparing him to Mr. Sanderson's other characters from his other novels.<br /><br />The other characters in \\"Steelheart\\" were pretty awesome, and definitely added to the story's dynamics and relationships. Prof is an especially interesting character to me. He's that kind of leader who's aloof yetpassionate in the inside, with dark pasts that he's reluctant to share with others. Plus he has a cool black lab coat and science goggles--can you spell super cool superhero? The other Reckoners in the team, like Tia, Abraham and Cody, really helped to create that group vibe within their team, each bringing their own personalities and styles to add to the family. And, of course, the apple of David's eye, Megan. I quite liked her character as well. She's tough and passionate, and she definitely has some serious issues going on in her life, but there's also a vulnerability in her. After all, she's just a teenager. And the twist at the end--let me just say here that I knew it! But of course, no spoilers!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Steelheart\\" is a fun read that's almost like a comic book, filled with action and super cool pew pew powers and all that. I wouldn't say that it's the greatest of Mr. Sanderson's books, but it's still worth checking out--it's a fun ride!<br /><br />Rating: 4/5
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It gave me so many different Ways to make something different  for dinner. Its the best website they came out with
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Really liked it. My parents enjoyed it too. We love disaster movies and zombie movies and this did not disappoint.
1400069289|5.0|I learned so much from this book. It explained so many things which were unexplained in my life. This book is very very amazing.
0142000671|5.0|Good item, it was everything I wanted and more. Glad I wasn't disappointed. Hope to do business again in the future.
B009WUBERW|5.0|I'm a sucker for 80's and 90's action films no matter how cheesy or impossible the fight scenes may be and this movie lives up to that genre.
B004WE01YA|4.0|I was so excited to see this wonderful film now in stunning 3D.  I recently bought a Sony 3D tv only to find that my current blu ray player had to be changed to a 3d blu ray player in order to watch 3d movies.  Being in the UK the multi region 3D disc and bluray discs work fine.  However as the UK is in a different region the DVD disc is not playable unless you happen to have a multiregion player.  All in all buying from the USA is a bit expensive as I had to pay international postage and 16.00GBP  customs duty in addition to the original price.  I love this film and it is currently unavailable in 3D yet highly sought after in the UK so the extra cost was worth it.  Getting a parcel all the way from America is somehow even more exciting.  It took around 2 weeks to arrive,  3D is amazing but 3D Disney films are out of this world!    Thanks for reading and enjoy the film.  Please rate as helpful.  Thank you!
B00594XOZU|4.0|It used to work perfectly but now it says it is taking longer then it should try again in a bit but my mom was like she had to upgrade it and I'm trying to figure out how to do dat on my kindle fire HD :/
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is amazing. Towards the beginning, you have to grind a bit but eventually it becomes a great game. Picking warrior is easiest and save all your gems, for they become very helpful for buying better equipment. Have lots of fun guys!
B00F35BV64|4.0|I'm a fan of the franchise and I think this film builds nicely on it. Yes, it has some leaps of logic and is kind of corny and campy in some places, but overall if you liked Star Trek (2009), you'll enjoy this film.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|More than a book, it is the insight into a friend's journey. It provokes the reflection of one's circumstances while you feel the warmth of having someone tell you that they completely understand.
081099741X|5.0|I had never seen a Wes Anderson movie. I pre-ordered the book simply because I enjoy Zoller-Seitz’s usually spot on movie reviews at Roger Ebert.com and his TV reviews in the New York magazine. The day the book arrived I could not put it down. Very few books are truly unique. This one is. It’s a wonderfully done book filled with production stills, beautiful illustrations, story boards, photos and more. Even more impressive is the interview with Wes Anderson which reveals his thought processes in the writing, producing and directing of his films. It’s fascinating stuff!<br /><br />After reading the book I have watched three of Anderson’s movies and have become an instant fan.  Also, thanks to this book, a well informed  knowledgeable fan who appreciates the many talents of this wonderful director.<br /><br />Great book! Highly recommended not only for Wes Anderson fans but for anyone interested the process of making a movie.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|I'm a big fan of heist movies - I saw the cast of this one and the original premise, so I thought this could be a good one.  I was wrong.  From beginning to end the entire plot and heist scenarios are totally contrived - intended to convey merely the feeling of a good heist rather than something that is remotely believable.  Add to that the sorely lacking dialog, and extremely loose character and relational development, and you have a loser.  This is the tweener version of a heist movie, so don't come knocking if you're the type that looks forward to a great reveal.
B00DG292SK|4.0|Learned a few things that kept the narrative interesting and flowing.  Not a classic though. A little too much &#34;poor me&#34;.

B005IZLPME|4.0|I like a lot of people at first didn't like this movie. But after reading the new marvel now  comic and giving it a second chance. I think it is a very good movie.  Id give the movie 5 stars but the plot and story is very so so, which isn't fair, because the comics have great story and I feel doesn't do this movie justice.  Someone on 1 star review said \\"what super power does capt have? all he has is a shield he throws\\". To that I say, He doesn't have super powers. He is just peak human condition physically and ok mentally.  LIke a real person. The Capt could be anyone of us.  boy , girl ect.  That is his appeal in my opinion.  All in all , I like this movie and wish I found capt America earlier in life. since im 30 now, it a very good movie and the comics are good to.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|The good wife has it all, funny, drama, sex, and good characters.  I have been watching the showing from the beginning, and it has only gotten better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As usual Downton Abby exceeds expectations.  The writing and acting confine to be superb.  also get ready for some sad storylines.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|Totally satisfied.  Perfect ending to a show cut short before it even got started.  Great cast, brilliant one liners.  Watch the show before watching the movie.  It will make it a whole lot more enjoyable.
034580404X|4.0|I was given the trilogy as a birthday gift.  Great fun!  Aside from the steamy sex (which by the way, is not so memorable a year+ later) I enjoyed the development of the characters and their relationship over the years.  It'll be very interesting to see how the books translate to movie version.  I think people should read the books before dissing them.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Of seems pretty good so, not glitches yet. I like the Mario feel to it. I just wish there was more things and powers to do and use.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This is the first work that I've read by this author. I have heard that his other works are better. It is an interesting story for those who like to read about the supernatural.

B004LQGXPA|4.0|Having just read atkinson's terrific trilogy of the US Army in the Euopean theater in WWII, I relished watching Patton, which I hadn't viewed since it's original release. George C Scott was even better than I recalled and the movie brought the Atkinson books to life.

B007EE4XKI|5.0|David Mack has successfully created a book keeping the characters as we remember them from the show without letting hid imagination run wild.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An unusual twist on post-apocalyptic sci-fi, and a cliffhanger at every other chapter. Plot twists mostly defied my guesses, characters were easy to identify with and care about. The ending was slightly typical in its starry-eye vision of the future, but it also leaves many loose ends for future books, and daydreams.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Other than losing my gems I love Restaurant Story and Bakery Story. I play everyday and it's very exciting.  The only thing that I'm very upset about is losing my gems.  I lost 10 Total on restaurant story and 2 on Bakery Story.  I was saving up to get 20 gems to get 2 items.  I hope you check out what's going on with my account.  It made me upset when that happened.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I didn't know anything about this show, so we downloaded season, even though it cost $12 for 7 episodes. We're hooked!!  We're prepared to download season 2, even though there is a $21 charge.  But season 2 has 13 episodes.  If the season 2 episodes are as good as season 1, we'll be buying season 3--definitely recommend!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you asked me what I remembered about the Shining.  I would have probably said, “REDRUM.”  Dan Torrance, his crazy father, the Overlook Hotel, and perhaps the topiary animals.  Some of that list comes from watching the movies; the Stanley Kubrick one and then the SyFy one.  This is mostly due to the fact that I read the Shining quite a few years ago and have never picked it up again.  I don’t generally reread books, even if they ARE written by Stephen King.  So I have been exposed to the movies much more recently.  Also, I saw a Ghost Hunters special at the hotel that the Overlook Hotel was based on, so that helped too.  I tell you all this dear reader, not to bore you, but to let you know that there isn’t much reason for you to go back and read the Shining before you read this book.  In fact, good old Stephen King has you covered there as well.  There are lots of call backs to the Shining in this book.  Enough that if you only read the wiki online and had never ACTUALLY read the Shining, I think you would be good.  Now that is out of the way, on to the book.<br /><br />  I loved this book, not because it was “classic Stephen King,”  whatever the heck that means.  But because it was an interesting and exciting story.  The ending was very good and rather unexpected considering how the foreshadowing seemed to be heading(sneaky Mr. King, very sneaky).  There are a few surprises for the Constant Readers, who have probably all ready finished this book.  I wouldn’t say this is my favorite Stephen King book of all time.  But I would say probably top ten.  Which also means that this probably the best horror book I’ve read in around 5 years.  Sorry Joe Hill, this book IS better.  For a book as long as this one(544 pages), it felt rather short to me.  I probably would have been good with maybe one more adventure from the True Knot crowd, to really get a feeling for who they were individually.  Especially Andi’s story which seems to start and then go completely no where.  I guess it could be just an example of the way the True Knot works, but still it seemed abruptly cut to me.  While the main group was pretty decently fleshed out, at least by the end anyway, I guess I could have just used a little more.  Like icing on the cake.<br /><br />  As all ways I will be watching for the next thing Stephen King does and if he decides he needs to make a book 3 with the continuing adventures of… Whoever… I would gladly read that too.  Until then, stay away from RVs, rest stops, and Winnebagos you never what you might run into.tely no where.

B0089LOG02|4.0|This is a story about a teenage girl (Molly) who is caught in the foster care system and is almost ready to age out. Molly has been moved from home to home. Shortly after we meet her, she is given community service time for a small crime, and is punished with hours of community service. This community service lands Molly at the house of an elderly woman (Vivian), to help clean her attic.<br /><br />As it turns out, this woman is orphaned, and as a young child, was put on the \\"Orphan Train,\\" an actual train that carried orphaned children from NYC across the country, in the hopes that families might adopt them. As a result, many of these children were taken in by impoverished families looking for farm help, or worse.<br /><br />Vivian and Molly, both having lived childhoods without parents, share a common bond. The story toggles between the modern-day conversations of Vivian and Molly and Molly's struggle to fit into her world as she becomes a young adult, to the childhood days of Vivian when she was transported on the Orphan Train and what followed in her life as a result.<br /><br />This is a book that is well researched, and I'd encourage the reader to read the \\"Afterward\\" first. This section explains the history involved in this book, and how it is based on actual data that was gathered to be shared in an article in People magazine about the Orphan Train. That article was never printed, but the author used the information uncovered in this research to create an accurate representation of what happened on the Orphan Train. Much of what you are reading may be about actual life experiences of someone who rode the train.<br /><br />I learned a great deal through this novel, never having heard of the Orphan Train before. The two women, one young and one old, reconcile their stories of finding a heart-sense of \\"home,\\" and the bond they share becomes a highlight of the story. I'm surprised this is not on the reading list of most High School programs because of the valueof what is learned through this novel.
096798467X|5.0|My husband bought this because he is into pizza making. He plans on building his own oven when we move in our next house that is HOA free. He really has enjoyed this book and goes through spurts where he wont put it down for a week- by now he has read it several times. It has tons of useful information an pictures both snap shots and drawings. He has enjoyed it and finds it very useful. Very good buy.
B003G0RWH0|4.0|This is the classic movie version of the play.  Marlon Brando is wonderful.<br /><br />I don't know if this affects all the HD versions, but the last ten minutes of the video were corrupted to the point where I could not see the end.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Have followed Star Trek for years, from the small screen to the big.  Think Chris Pine and cast do a great job of continuing the franchise.  Great action scenes as well as the human story drive this movie well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love it...can't wait till the movie comes out, it is definitely a must see!  The author is fabulous. I loved hercwork .
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Am a great fan of action movies and really like the Iron Man character.  Robert Downey Jr. does a great acting job and makes the character believable.  Saw it in the theater too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Full of surprises and plot twists that made sense (rare these days, some writers seem to go off the deep end and make the reader feel jerked around by implausible events, not so here). Well done, with a world revealed bit by bit so I continued to want more.<br /><br />I read the Wool Omnibus and just finished the next in the series, the Shift Omnibus. I still want more, so I'm continuing with the last in the trilogy, Dust.<br /><br />Thank you Hugh Howey!
0385523394|5.0|I had seen the Netflix series and loved it so I decided to read the book. It was wonderful. It was so much real and raw emotions. It was moving to see what these women had to go through in prison.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Our entire family loves this movie and laughs together. Will Ferrell is hilarious and endearing.  Great cast. Buy and enjoy
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this book on audio, and it was great. I completely recommend this book to anybody who is into the Suzanne Collins series. This book was almost nothing but action and suspense.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|It was great to have a story to follow up on what happened after \\"Nemesis\\"<br /><br />I was sad for Worf..  But happy to have someone expand on what may have happened to B-4 and with Data's memories.  I'm anxious to start book 2.  As a busy teacher and graduate student I appreciate these books as a guilty pleasure and escape from writing and lecturing.......thank you David Mack!
B00DMEQP46|1.0|I don't normally write reviews for styles of music I don't like. What would I have to say, It sucks because it's...well, I'm not sure what this is supposed to be. It's not music, it's not &#34;ironic&#34;, it's not clever, it's just moronic.  There is nothing to get in this vapid crap. The lyrics remind me of bad freshman poetry trying to be &#34;relevant&#34;. It's just horrible from start to finish. Just goes to show you can sell anything if you call it &#34;edgy&#34;. I don't know about their life but their music is certainly a lie! It's not music at all.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|After playing the Real Slenderman and being petrified out of my skull (and lovin' it), I decided to play Slender Man Chapter 1. Your job is to collect eight pages before Slender man finds you. The minute he gets close, you receive a static-like sound and the screen becomes unclear and grainy. Once the screen clears, you're relatively safe.<br /><br /> The first thing I noticed about this game was that the controls and camera were better than the Real Slender Man. Unlike the Real Slender Man, you can walk faster. You can also go backwards (which I ended up doing most of the time because I was so paranoid.) Your left thumb controls your movement using a virtual analog stick and your right thumb controls the camera. The camera is better with this one because you can do a quick turnabout without the camera going wonky and you end up staring at the floor or sky.<br /><br />Compared to the Real Slender Man, this wasn't as difficult/creepy. Nevertheless, this was STILL very scary. I was scared out of my wits! The music which was sorta reminiscent of Friday the 13th (at least to my ears) made me break out into a cold sweat.<br /><br /> With this game, there are two episodes: The Road and The Farm. You also get to choose the difficulty level and whether you want to play it during the morning or evening. Being the big wuss that I am, I decided to play this during the morning (medium) thinking I'd have plenty of sunshine to comfort me. I wasn't comforted because the sky seemed overcast, dark, and dreary. LOL.<br /><br /> I started off with the Farm, since the thought of animals and cows grazing would somehow reduce my terror. LOL. Lemme tell ya, this was NO farm. It was a barren expanse of land. The trees didn't have any leaves on them and the place seemed very cold and empty. The graveyard coupled with the eerie music made me thisclose to hyperventilating.<br /><br />The Road (in my opinion) seemed scarier because it was narrow, which heightened my feeling of dread knowing that a madman was on my tail.<br /><br />The only glitch I've encountered was when I was at the farm. As I was running, I kinda fell off the platform. Everything turned white and I couldn't go back. I was stuck and had to start over. I hope the producers could fix this glitch, since another reviewer has also experienced the same thing.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this game. If you love survival horror, you're going to love Slender Man! Don't miss out on this great game! Start off with this game and then play the Real Slender Man (which is in my opinion scarier because it's pitch-black and you walk around with a flashlight - and it isn't all that bright). Can you survive this creep-fest? Play it and find out.<br /><br />I've downloaded Slender Man Chapter 2 from Google Play and I'm looking forward to playing it.<br /><br />Happy gaming, AKA surviving!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This movie contains great effects....lots of action and a decent story line.  No sexual scenes (thank you) at least 3 vulgarities (why)?
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great fantasy! Interesting story.  Plenty of possibilities for plot development.  I enjoy trying to figure where they are headed and being surprised.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love this game!! I play it until I get sleepy. (Which is right now) I recommend it to. anyone who loves diamonds!!! Fun!!!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I haven't experienced any problems with it on my KFHD. Great graphics and sound of pieces moving. What makes it better than a real board in my opinion is that it shows you after the roll of the dice which pieces can move. When you choose a piece to move it shows you the destination options for that piece. You can undo to consider other options. Play against the app or another person is enjoyable.
B004UPAN6W|4.0|I enjoy Hugh Jackman, and I like the Wolverine character.  The storyline held my interest all the way through.  The film is diverting, and that is what I was seeking.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|I stumbled across the sequel to Pollyanna, a book I enjoyed from the age of 8. Good to see her growing up with the glad game intact!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Was skeptical of another lawyer show but was rather impressed.  Good show!  Keeps it interesting and you actually care about the characters.
B008476HBM|5.0|I read this book at least once a year and see new things in it every time. A timeless classic.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love Zooey Deschenel, so I quickly got hooked on this show. The second season is just as much fun as the first. It's my late-night go-to entertainment to let go of the day.
B0095R3D0I|5.0|Excellent quality! It was great to see a 20 year old, classic movie restored to all its rightful glory. One of the best Halloween movies, and sure to be a favorite of every member of the family!
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|I like it it has some really good song on it .i can wait for another new one to come out
B0072V394E|2.0|I like westerns. After about 20 min stopped. The costumes and sets were NOT American west, not even close. Don't waste your time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The best television series in 20 years. Superb writing, great storylines and wonderful characters to care about and identify with.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Cool game, fun puzzles, will keep you entertained for hours! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys hidden object games!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The writing for the original TV series and later the big screen movies always left questions unanswered by creating vague references to past encounters.  The new series starring Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto demonstrate the ability to tie old questions into new story lines in ways George Lucas wishes were available to him when he made the bridge between Episode II and Episode IV, which was much too predictable.  This new generation is neither predictable or gratuitous, it is just great entertainment.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book has received a lot of attention and rave reviews for its compelling plot: what if you find a letter your husband wrote to you \\"to be opened in event of my death\\"?  The moral and ethical issues in the book are deeply gripping, and the author doesn't take any shortcuts.<br /><br />What's almost incredible is that the book has so much else going for it:  told from the perspectives of three families, Cecelia and John-Paul's marriage is just one of the relationships plunged into conflict.  The other characters and subplots are equally well developed, and Moriarty's prose style is nearly perfect, at time reminiscent of the matter-of-fact irony in Doris Lessing's  writing: \\"Marriage was a form of insanity; love hovering permanently on the edge of aggravation\\" (378).<br /><br />The novel's multi-faceted explorations of grief and love, of loyalty and lies, are nuanced and avoid simplistic solutions and platitudes.  As for the book's epilogue, it's simply brilliant, a \\"what-if\\" examination of all the major characters' choices, demonstrating how little we know and how much we hide.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|The primary reason movies become effective story tellers is the ability to suspend disbelief.  Jack Reacher gives you pieces of his history to tantalize that suspension and then misdirects your attention when it is most effective to propel the story further.  Great entertainment value in addition to the action that Tom Cruise always bring to his action roles.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The storyline, the characters, the setting - all work together to create an elaborate and engrossing story that is hard to put down.  I highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really interesting with the new updates. I really like this game and I wish they would make a second version.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I pay this all the time, although there is a pop up ad with every game. At first it was annoying, but now I am used to it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun a game every one should have best game out there. It gets progressively harder witch makes it a challenge
B003B02O0A|5.0|Five stars because it was a book that I could not put down...stayed up til 2:30am several nights til justice was most definitely served!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|brilliant and captivating! kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book! coukdnt of bwen written any better!
B00ECLU346|1.0|It was never funny and then they killed animals and acted like it was supposed to be funny. It wasn't funny at all! This is the biggest bunch of crap I have ever watched in my life. And my girl was in this movie and still - I hated it. Melissa please don't do another movie for these jerks. PLEASE!
B007EW9ISM|5.0|For what it is worth, the Cosmonaut was purchased to be a tool for rough sketching and it has not disappointed.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Omg! This game was super fun! Wasn't crazy about paying 4.99 for the game, but I was so wrapped up in it I had to buy it. Great story! Best game I have played! Bravo!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is the story of a smart street cat named Bob and the impact he makes on a guy struggling to overcome drug attention. It is honest and straightforward but it also heartwarming. I don't think I will look at a homeless person the same.  What an inspirational book for all of us.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The subway surfer game is a good quality game for kids<br /><br />and is challenging for their hand and eye coordination.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|This game of hidden objects is very different than other ones because it allows you to do the following;<br />1. It lets you chose every level and/or when you repeat the level 3 different types of finding your hidden objects. Example is you can chose \\"handman\\" (one letter at a time is given and you have to solve the word so that you can look for the item). Another is if you want to search in the dark with only a stream of light the goes back and forth of the objects (you cant control where the light goes) and another choice would be a word list or find the objects by them giving you a shadow picture and you have to guess what it is then find it. The choices change throughout the levels which makes you not lose interest and keeps you playing. Also the pictures where the objects are hidden are nice and somewhat hard since there are places on the screen where the colors of the objects blend with the background.<br /><br />I recommend this game and its been awhile since I could.....
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a great logic game and works very well on my nexus 7. It is simple yet still challenging.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is just what I needed for an alarm clock on my Kindle Fire. I like the choices for clock style and alarm sound. The retro options are fun. The ability to easily dim or brighten the display is great,too.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0031RS2HC|3.0|It took me a long time to embrace this book but in the end I enjoyed it.  There is too much description of unnecessary &#34;by the by&#34; to make the book interesting.  Not sure why it was consider movie material, perhaps it translated better than on paper.  There really was no plot, just a guy walking into a town at the wrong time and getting caught up in the dramas of that town.
B001EHDQFO|5.0|This is such a terrific book - I tend to buy a few copies -and give them away - repeat.  I like it that much. The message is so clean, concise, and valuable. As a writer and a multi-tasker - doing one small thing a day - is the panacea for success and fulfillment.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|Awesome CD from Korn, as always. These guys continue to rock as they progress thru time, including the song & video for &#34;Never Never&#34;
1439156816|5.0|While I have never read a S. King book - I was smart enough to read this excellent book, On Writing. I love this book - it is a treasure trove of superlative (i.e. use words like 'superlative' on Amazon.com reviews only - kidding) insights, stories and advice.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a ton of fun! It's basically the same game as temple run or subway surfers, bit the minions make it more enjoyable. I can't help but giggle at those silly minions.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|This is a good movie but not as funny as the last two.  It just couldn't keep up with the others.  The best part was the end during credits!!<br /><br />I still recommend seeing it but just know it is not full of laughs.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|And may the odds be ever in your favor. When I first heard of the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, half of my family were already reading the last book, and I was more than once accosted to see if I was reading it yet. I began my journey through Panem shortly afterward. I was surprised that it was such an easy book to get into with a female protagonist which I was not entirely familiar with. I have read a few books like it, but it was a little different that what I would typically read. I was impressed with the character descriptions, and the action of the book. The book follows Katniss Everdeen, a young girl from district 12 in Panem, a post United States dictatorship. She volunteers to take her sisters place in a tournament to the death in which the 12 districts send a male and female to participate. It goes through her struggle for survival, and how she makes some unlikely allies who later become very important in her life. I did feel that there were times when it was a little slower than I thought a death tournament would be like. There are some graphic depictions of death in this book series, which I would not recommend for younger teens who may not be familiar with such things. The news is one thing, but having those images conjured up in ones head might be a little too much. I did appreciate the dynamic between Katniss and Peeta. I thought it was refreshing and contrasted well with the world in which they lived. It was heart wrenching to see Katniss intervene at the reaping on behalf of her sister. I would recommend this book for reading aloud with your family with older teens. For a young adult book, I did not feel that the vocabulary was very challenging, which I think should be a focus for this age group. Overall, I liked the series, and I re-read them with my family when we are in the mood for something familiar, but not overly challenging.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Worked just once after installation. Now every time it is hanging or giving error &quot;Cannot connect to camera&quot; . Restart doesn't help.
B005PK57IK|5.0|It is a trully entertaining as well as stimulating viewers' thinking production.  The characters are endearing, presenting a wide spectrum of human variety, intelligent, passionate in their personal goals and values.  The interactions beautifully reflect the complexity of relationships where personal and social interests clash and intertwine.  The series stands out, in addition to other aspects, with relatively little violence, while keeping viewers in suspense.  It is not an easy challenge in the market where suspense and excitement is usually created mostly by the use of physical violence  and criminal activities.  While The Good Wife plots obviously include criminal behaviors and thinking patterns, the lines are often subtle and blurred, demonstrating complexity of human reality.<br />While generally not a fan of popular TV series and drama, The Good Wife is among my favorites.  I find myself returning to episodes from all 4 seasons, welcoming the characters as old friends I miss.<br />Thank you for the beautiful, educational as well as entertaining production.
B00CTT9646|5.0|The 3d + Bluray combo package combination packaged with a great full sized prop replica. The phaser is plastic but well built and clean. Looks great and comes with a nice stand. Movie quality from the 3D and BluRay is as good as the regular product.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love pintrest. There is something for everyone. So many good ideas for every occasion . so many great recipes to choose from.
B000I55YV2|2.0|Silly story, not very well done or interesting.  I didn't watch it to its completion, but I doubt if I missed much.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I downloaded this app primarily to tie all of my devices together. Unfortunately, I do not get all of my putchased books to show on all of the devices running this app. Very disappointed.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I used to use it all the time and it worked really well. I think it needs an update because all of a sudden it doesn't work correctly. It always says Try Again In A While or something along those lines.
B008OOYALE|5.0|A great game but costs too much to get rid of shrubs trees ect... takes too long to build money to buy habitats
B006LSZECO|2.0|I had heard good reviews of Gone Girl, and so was anxious to read it.  In the beginning, however, I found it difficult to really get interested in the book. However, because of the good reviews I kept trying. Finally, it did grab my interest, and I was anxious to read further. Unfortunately, I found the conclusion to be a tremendous letdown. It's almost as if the author got tired of writing and just stopped. Frankly, I found the book to be a big let down.
B00EU9VCKO|4.0|I think its great although I was finished with my picture and then I thought a button would do more to my picture but it was a button that made my picture all randomized. So anyways it's a great app but label the button. ^-^
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After my past mouse decided to not function properly I decided to purchase this Anker mouse. This mouse is pretty nifty as you can change the sensitively on the fly. You can also have different profiles of the mouse that let you save different customized presets. These features are nice if you play different games or use multiple software packages. Overall I find this a great buy because you get a great precision mouse for a great price.
1562827693|5.0|Practical and can improve your quality of life! Eastern thought put into a simple and easy to understand book; easy reading.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This is a great book and exceptionally helpful to we authors who are trying to get on the ladder in the ebook market. It provides a very strong argument for the use of twitter and blogging in driving sales. I will have to read the book again of course because you can't get a handle on the system after one read but I had almost given up on twitter and now, perhaps I will give it a go again. The author is at great pains to convince the reader that his blogs are not contrived and that this is how he genuinely feels. His writing is brilliant and his blogs come across as 100% genuine (I had a tear in my eye reading them) and yet he explains the great pains he goes through and the long time he takes to compose them. There is something ambivalent here for me but perhaps it is that I am something of a sceptic! I certainly learned a lot and will be trying to put it into practice.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Great story, based on good research. I've been to Pompeii several times and this book brought the city to life. Recommended reading if you ever visit the Amalfi coast.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Had trouble getting to know the characters relationships to one another.  Other than that it was a wonderful  story with lots of suspense.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn throws curve ball after curve ball. I read this book in a weekend, which is rare for me. Great read and a fun story!
B00FF56IR4|2.0|Seriously, I bought the whole season via VuDu and after watching the first 3 episodes I'd have to say that I'm very disappointed. It's really not that good. In fact, the latest episode 3 pretty much put me to sleep it was so boring. I'm not sure what I expected from this series but this is not it. And seriously, putting British people in an American TV series is just stupid, you can't understand half of what they say! Or at least I can't. Waste of money now that I've seen 3 of the shows.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|It has all the songs I want to have on it.  Went to a concert recently and heard these songs live. Wanted them in my music library.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I streamed this in last night via VuDu. After 15 minutes I shut it off and went and read until about midnight. At this time I powered the movie back up, but as I was watching it I found myself glancing over to the left to watch Rambo on one of my other TVs even though I had the volume on mute on that one. I have 3 TVs mounted in my bedroom :) Anyhow, I watched the whole movie so it wouldn't be a waste of money. Will Smith's character was such an SOB I hated him right off the bat. And as far as Will's son goes, I haven't found a single thing I like about him. There is nothing about him that stands out more than any other actor. As far as After Earth goes, nothing special about the movie at all. The visuals were kinda lack-luster, the story was unoriginal, and the characters were pretty much unimpressive, if not outright annoying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game with lots of extra content and no energy bar so unlimited fun filled gameplay for all ages.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This novel can be read and interpreted on any number of levels. Regardless of the level of interpretation that you choose, it remains a captivating and entertaining read.  I predict that you will thoroughly enjoy it.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|This book is horrible. It reads as if it was written by someone in junior high. A total waste of my time.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Wow! Loved the whole season. Charlie Hunnam is one sexy man! Love the Jax and Tara love story. Can't wait to see what happens next.

B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great clean drama series! I love these UK historical fiction series.  This takes you back into history and connects you with the characters.
B001H4R4LQ|3.0|I love to read, and if it is something I want to read I can tear through it quickly.  I didn't have to force myself to keep picking it up to read, but I could only read a few chapters per sitting before I would feel like it was a required reading in High School.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|Nice way to waste an enormous amount of time. May the schwartz be with you.  Keep the baby faith.  Peace out.
B00CU8QB9Y|5.0|As a great admirer of Richard Dawkins since the publication of his &#34;Selfish Gene&#34; I have read all his books in which he has so eloquently and convincingly put the case for evolution. His latest book &#34;An Appetite For Wonder: The Making of a Scientist &#34;<br />is a fascinating, interesting and well written book about his early life and his introduction to a most wonderful career. I would recommend this book not only to those who have read his previous publications but to anyone interested in the evolutionary sciences.<br />I look forward in anticipation to his next publication.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|You will find something in this book to spur your creativity. F4 at 1/500 or f16 at 1/30, both 'correct' exposures; but which is  \\"creatively correct?\\" Find out by reading Mr. Peterson's book.

140006922X|1.0|I am not offended by this book, but I am disappointed by how many people have been taken in by its clever but not well supported argument. As a professional historian I am keenly aware of how hard it is to reconstruct the past from fragmentary evidence. The farther back in time one goes, the more tentative such reconstructions must be and the more speculation has to fill in the gaps in the record. Good historical research and writing depends, however, on clearly distinguishing between fact and deduction, and insists that deduction be based on sound reasoning from the evidence. Judged by that standard, this book falls very short indeed.<br /><br />The author does a good job of reconstructing first century C.E. Palestine and setting it within the context of the larger Roman world. He discusses the messianic fervor of the age, examines the frustration Rome experienced trying to govern the troublesome province and considers several revolutionaries that challenged imperial rule. He then tries to flesh out the historical Jesus within this world, and in doing so fails badly.<br /><br />Reza Aslan's cherry-picks a handful of Gospel passages to support his claim that Jesus of Nazareth was not a man of peace, but another revolutionary in the zealot tradition. The few passages that suite his argument (\\"I have not come to bring peace but a sword...Let he who does not have a sword go out and buy one.\\") he treats as statements of facts. Those that do not fit, he explains away. In his clever hands the story of the Good Samaritan becomes, not a parable of universal love, but a diatribe against the priestly class. The story certainly challenges the legalism of the temple cult that prevents a Levite from defiling himself by helping a bleeding stranger, but surely it says much more than that.<br /><br />At some points Aslan's reasoning becomes rather strange. Having shown how quickly the temple guards and the Roman garrison brutally suppressed any attack on the cultic center, he comesup with a convoluted argument about Jesus' efforts to drive out the money changers. Once Jesus overturned their tables, Aslan asserts, his threat to the established order became so clear that it had to be dealt with immediately. Supporters of the High Priest then trapped Jesus into making a seditious statement so that he could be arrested and turned over to the Roman governor. If the cleansing of the temple really was a politically revolutionary act, why did the authorities not arrest Jesus on the spot as they had done with others before him? They certainly had the power to do so. And what about the curious passage in the account of the Last Supper in which Jesus tells his disciples to arm themselves of which Aslan makes so much? This statement might be seen as an effort to launch a rebellion were it not for the apostles' assertion that they had \\"two swords\\" and Jesus comment that these weapons were \\"enough\\"--or as the New Common Bible reads, \\"enough of this,\\" by which Jesus might have meant, \\"enough of this nonsense.\\" Two swords could not have kept Jesus from being taken in the Garden of Olives (even if he had chosen to resist, which he did not), never mind launch a rebellion.<br /><br />Arguments should be evaluated on own their strength and merits, without assigning ulterior motives to the author. In this case, however, it impossible not to see The Zealot through the lens of the author's preface. Aslan freely admits that he converted to a very conservative brand of Christianity as young adult only to become disillusioned and return to Islam. If he finds spiritual sustenance in reconnecting with his roots, so much the better for him. In rejecting the most rigid form of Christianity, however, he seems rather determined to throw the baby out with the bath water. Anyone seeking a better understanding of Jesus and his ministry would do well to look elsewhere.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works very well.  I have it on android phone and on IPad and both are easy to use.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Had issues getting some of the versions of A.B. to run decent on my older Android tablet.  This one runs great.  The levels are definitely challenging, and like the new characters, and that you play from both sides (birds and pigs).

B006LSZECO|3.0|Suspenseful ... Unpredictable....unrealistic...but certainly a sad commentary on modern marriages.  Makes me question the sensationalism of the nightly news reports.
B009NG1Q96|2.0|This book is more of the same drab boring non-story as before. Two guys and a gals. She continues to flip flop between them, sometimes even in the same paragraph. Boring.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love the new set up and I usually don't like change but this is awesome and I love the new icons although the tutorial is a bit much I'm glad they took the extra time to explain everything cuz some purple would be lost.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Grisham's novels have been somewhat predictable over the past few years - perhaps penned by an apprentice.<br />The Litigators is a fun book with a few interesting twists.<br />I love a novel with a dog as the lead character!<br />Nothing he writes will rival The Firm, but The Litigators was a good read
B004ZNARH4|3.0|I wasn't that impressed as far as the sound quality goes.  I didn't find the DVD-Audio or BD albums contained in this set to be a significant improvement over other stereo mixes.  The surround sound was cool though, especially the Quad mix.  Too bad it isn't just sold as its own mix rather than in a $100 box set.<br /><br />If all you're after here is the best sounding version possible, pass on this and get one of the older Capitol or Harvest discs which are very good sound quality.  I also have the MFSL and it isn't light years ahead of the older Capitol or Harvest discs.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once I started reading Doctor Sleep I could not put it down. I liked the nod to NOS4a2 at the beginning. In my opinion the book was not that scary. That doesn't  matter, since I will read anything that Stephen King writes. This is a must read for anyone who is a fan of Stephen King or Joe Hill. This book is for anyone who just likes a well told story.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Well overall I think this is the best movie out of the 3 of the Batman series. This movie is more action packed and has a great twist and plot to it. The only thing on a personal note is that I like to receive that box cover with my Blu-ray movies and this did not come with one but it's alright, overall the movie is great.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is really fun, and cute. The theme song is really awesome too! I should rate it 6 stars if I could!!!!!!! Really really cool!
B00594XOZU|1.0|Every time i try to log in on kik it just loads for a little while and the says that i should try at another time. So i waited two days, same result, 4days, same result, I reset my kindle to factory details, same result. This would be a five star app if they fixed the problem.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love the minions this is the game for you . You can earn your charecter by gathering bannanas and coins.
B004JLDSIC|4.0|This CD is instantly enjoyable, and it is wonderful to see two great talents come together (both commercially and in real life).  Both are in top form here.  I would have given it five stars, but I have several audiophile version Stacey Kent CDs that have better resolution sonically.  For 9 out of 10 systems, this CD will reward you with mellow, sonic bliss.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Good story, but foul language. I probably would not have finished it if I had known before I purchased the book.
B000WTNCYA|3.0|Melody is in top form, and her voice is great as always, but I felt short-changed, as if this were recorded specifically for LP vinyl rather than CD.  The disc is barely 35 minutes long.  Just when you are getting into Melody's silky voice and the wonderful arrangements, things come to a rather abrupt end.  Perhaps a special edition can be issued, with three or four bonus tracks.  Or, it can be offered as part of a two-disc package.  Otherwise, a very fine and very listenable CD.  She is one of favorite female vocalists (right up there with Eva Cassidy, Stacey Kent, Norah Jones, Renee Olstead, and Jennifer Warnes).  If you're a fan of Ms. Gardot, I would still buy this disc...just be aware that it's \\"done too soon\\" (in the immortal words of Neil Diamond).
B00594XOZU|1.0|I was very disappointed when I got this app and now it won't even let me register. I was expecting better
B0056K4VZ4|5.0|Of you're a Keb Mo fan, and an audiophile, you will appreciate the TLC that went into the production of this SACD.  I always try to find the highest-resolution format for each disc I buy, and, compared to the standard (non-SACD) version, this one captures way more detail, ambience, and better  imaging. That isn't always the case with audiophile recordings.  Sometimes the master tapes and digital mastering of a standard &#34;red-book CD are every bit as good (or at least VERY CLOSE) to the more expensive hi-end versions.  In this this case, it is well worth your while to grab the SACD version...it is noticeably better on all fronts.
B00B52F278|5.0|Even lacking its original lead this series was a lot of fun. OK... it's got a lot of CGI and green screen but WOW!  the scenes were action packed and the relationships between the characters were realistic and dramatic at the same time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am sorry I bought into the hype.  Maybe other people enjoyed it but I am yawning and not even amused.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|I had seen this movie when it first came out and really enjoyed seeing it again.<br />It's hard to find in standard vanilla venues but it's worth the hunt!
B000ID37SQ|1.0|It sucks that I pay for a rental and try to play it from my phone to the tv and you denied access to it. Very disappointing.
0385351399|3.0|I read the excerpt of this novel in the New York Times and immediately bought it. While as a short story The Circle holds together, a 500 page novel requires a more interesting plot than technology is bad. With better editing and more empathy for its main character, I would have enjoyed this much better. Recommended if you work in the tech industry since you will see many parallels. But it was also clear that the author doesn't really understand what it takes to make technology happen. There are many unrealistic, overnight events that would have taken months if not years of careful planning.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!  It's very touching, the story line and acting were great.  Have a box of tissues handy, you will need them.  I have seen it many times and it always makes me laugh and cry.
B001E7EONC|5.0|I love heist moves and I've seen them all.  This is one of the best in recent years.  Great characters well acted, unusual story and really fine fine screenplay.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I guess movie was ok to watch, hubby said he liked it, I myself didn't get to hear any of the dialogue, I am hearing impaired.  Seems to me  if these movie makers want more people to enjoy and buy their movies, they would take care of the disabled people.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|if you like the video, then get this app. it has the ways to die in the game, but you have to save them! it has funny bonuses and ways to save them. GET IT
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is the most accurate translation ever and I love the other we'll translated versions along with revised version to get the rasp more easily. Thankyyou Jehovah and the Governing Body
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This version of making is my very favorite. I wish they would come out with more versions. I'm not one for playing electronic games but this one is the best!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I love this entire series.  The characters and world they live in truly come alive.  You feel like you are right there on the journeys with them.  I love that the heroes aren't perfect too.  I love the humanity of the characters and I can't wait for more.  Morgan Rice has become one of my favorite authors!
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|I liked the movie overall. Some funny scenes if your a Philadelphia Eagles fan or football fan in general. It is not a movie about football.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Nikola Tesla is mostly unknown to people today; however, he was the father of hundreds of inventions.  This book gives a very brief overview of Tesla' s life, but unfortunately focuses way too many pages expounding theories regarding genius and ends the book with ads for other books I assume that he had published.<br /><br />The story would have been better if he had focused more closely on Tesla' s life and less on his personal theories of genius.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for someone who really wants to focus on the life of this largely unknown scientific genius.
B001NLL93W|5.0|City of Glass is a great continuation of the series! My children and I are reading the series together and I would recommend it to all!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Awesome! Couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the next book!! Loved the twist! Totally rooting for Team Stark!
B000002KKD|5.0|Could it really have been 1979?! Dance This Mess Around, indeed! When this album came out, there was nothing else remotely like it to be found in the world of music, which made it all the more appealing. I was a lowly record store clerk back in those days and I played this album every day for months and months. I might have made more than a few customers crazy by my non-stop in-store play, but I couldn't get enough of this weird and wonderful music. Revisiting this album on CD all these decades later, it's remarkable how fresh and exciting the music still sounds. This was, and remains, truly a landmark recording. The B'52's made several other very good albums over the years, but nothing else had the immediate impact and irrisistible appeal that this one did. Pick your own favorite tunes; it's all fun and fantastic!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love this app.  How ever I cannot spawn mobs in free version.<br />You can get mobs in pro version.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was okay but I guess when I read the ending I was a little bummed by it all.<br />She is a great writer I just got bored.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a must have game for all hunters it has awesome graphics cool guns and while it's fun it is all so some what challenging I recommend that everyone should get this amazing game
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I've always rejected the notion of talent. An insult to hard work I thought of it. But Gladwell has illustrated that it's not only hard work, but systemic advantages and downright coincidence coupled with hard work that creates superstars. Gladwell was extremely diligent in his research, backing his points with all sorts of statistics and lively anecdotes. What an amazing read this was!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I have not tried this  game but  I  hope I like it<br />And I heard that this game is good but let's see
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Found the movie entertaining and kept my attention throughout.  A couple of good jump scares as well.  Beautiful landscapes and nicely done costumes and storyline.  I came to this movie not expecting anything but a good sci fi tale and that is what I got.  Then I google to read on the making of the movie as I was interested and found all these negative reviews which I do not understand at all.<br /><br /> My only complaints with the movie are that I wished Will Smith did not take such an unemotional take on  his character, which I believe he did to emphasize his lack of fear but came off seemingly too deadpan.  What was needed was a more hard bitten warrior role and allowance for emoting, lack of fear doesn't mean lack of all the other emotions.  I felt Jaden Smith gave a great performance, you could feel he was really into the role, though  I thought a younger character would have engendered more of an emotional tug for the audience.<br /><br />Really, the movie wasn't the best out there but compared to recent blockbuster hideousness like Iron Man 3 it was well done.  Shyamalan is still one of  my favorite directors some of whose films I continually go back to view, I love his subtlety in directing.  I can only think a lot of the negative reviews are more based on perceived nepotism and show boating, anti-scientology bias ( I mean seriously, I didnt even see or think religion at all till I read the reviews.. wtf are you all pratting on about there, its just a movie)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app, even as an adult it's super fun! I play this every chance I get. It's amazing.
B0009QBLA8|3.0|As a fan of Twin Peaks, Mullholland Drive, and Lost Highway, I figured I'd better give this a look. If it were the first Lynch I'd seen, I probably would not want to see more. The movie is disturbing and grotesque. Horrifying in the fullest sense, without the sense of beauty and wonder that comes through in Twin Peaks at its finest.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Who would've thought that showing love to someone else could be so simple? I think the concepts outlined here are a great starting point for showing love to the people in your life that you care about.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Great stories,and great acting,.especially by Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright.It is, however,unfortunate that they are portraying how Washington D.C. really works.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is very fun to play and the graphics are pretty decent. I recommend this game to anyone wholeheartedly.
1606995359|5.0|Been an Uncle Scrooge fan since childhood so being able to buy a hardbound collection of Carl Barks work is exciting.<br />This is the early Carl Barks work featuring Uncle Scrooge so I look forward to the next volume in the series which should include some of the comics that I had read as a kid.<br />Quality binding and print. Looking forward to more in the series.
B0054R6BFM|1.0|As a parent, I felt that this story justified a girl for taking her own life, and blaming the people around her.  The narrator is her would-be boyfriend, who was shattered as he listened to the girl's tapes, which she made to tell everyone how much they had hurt her.  If only everyone had been nicer to her!  Well, she showed them, didn't she.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You will laugh and you will definitely cry. I fell in love with this book almost from the start. Witty, clever, funny and endearing... these words describe John Green's writing, his characters and most importantly, the love story that unfolds before you between Hazel and Augustus. These are the types of characters that stay with you long after you finish the last page... on your mind and in your heart.

B00EHZUQ1W|5.0|Devin Townsend was thinking about this project for years, and it finally came true in 2012, here he can have for prosperity his Broadway musical \\"The Retinal Circus\\". This theatrical production has a story that was supposed to illustrate his 20 years career. How the artist can put in a story the music of different parts of his career when every album has his own story? We can think that the story is secondary compare to the music. He wanted to give some entertaining value to the music that is already pleasant to hear. So we got a big production here with costumes, plenty of characters, visual objects, a choir. The musicians had the task to keep their focus on their music while there were a lot of things going on in the stage. Steve Vai, a long time friend of Devin is doing the narration between songs to explain the story of the evolution of man through the mind of Mr. Townsend, which include the invasion of aliens.<br /><br />The music is intense as usual with 3 different kinds of songs: the complex prog songs, the quiet and dark ones, and the heavy ones; 2 Strapping Young Lads songs, with the original guitar player, Jed Simon. The vocals of Anneke Van Giersbergen are well worth the price of admission here by giving more melodic feel to the music. You can here and see the results of this in the simple song \\"Ih-Ah!\\". The set list is well crafted with a balance set of songs of different moods and you never get bored during this 2 hours and forty minutes show.<br /><br />The final scene is really special with the recreation of a living room where every band members pass through a door and gets a rest while Devin sings his little acoustic piece \\"Little Pig\\". It's impressive to know that this big production was done on low budget and that the man is still sticking to his ideas despite the lack of funds. I hope this efforts serve him in the future and help the band to have more recognition because, the man has a lot of others ideas to bring to the world of the experimental metal scene, and need plenty of money if he want to do others big productions! I have to give 5 stars here, because it's the first time we can see a document of that nature and that proportion in the metal world.
B000T433CO|5.0|A great chick flick. Any movie that moves me to tears is great in my book. Great for girls night.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Just a good Irish tale filled with colorful characters and clever humor.Hope,faith and kindness can really make the world a better place.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Amazing app! The best alarm ever! It wakes up up every day with best waky-waky mood, I suggest it to everyone!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I just had to write a review for these since the last ones on here are from 2010. I have had these for almost 6 months now and I replaced my Razer Tiamat with these because the wiring was loose and killing my sound unless I fiddled with it. I was worried that the wireless would produce worse sound and distortion than the analg headphones from Razer, however I was absolutely floored when I got them set up and going and they sounded BETTER than my analog set. The construction is sturdy and the system has operated flawlessly, I have also been really impressed by the battery life, these have lasted me up to 9 hours before a recharge was neccessary. The biggest selling point for me however was the bass level, I love EDM and bass is an important aspect of the genre, so I hate crappy levels while I listen to pandora while I game, this set is just amazing for bass response considering they are headphones and wireless at that. Must buy for anyone considering getting rid of their wired set.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Oprah's list?  Overwhelmingly positive reviews?  This writing is certainly not bad, but I cannot see how it reaches the level of acclaim that it has received.  If not the writing, then the story? Okay, I'll agree that it is refreshing that Cheryl (I won't bother with the made up last name, why even bother with a last name if that is all it is worth?) is able to write honestly.  She does not appear to brag, or over inflate her story with dramatic scenes of bravery and courage on her part.  She does seem to write sincerely, and in so portrays the quiet bravery that is her story.  However, it is exactly this quiet bravery that many people, and, in this case, particularly women, face every day.  I do not see the uniqueness of her story.  I am amazed that she was able to accomplish a sole hike, but really how lucky was she that something more disasterous didn't happen?  And how reckless was she to live her life as she did, having random sexual encounters, shooting heroin, setting out to hike a trail with no real hiking experience (as evidenced by the worst of her travails - too small boots and too heavy pack)?  Is she supposed to be a role model for young women?  Sure, she had hardship in her life, but her reaction to it - drugs, casual sex, the ruination of a good relationship - is not especially encouraging.  And in the end, the book was a rather drawn out story of a hike that included basically the same experiences over its course, and thus from chapter to chapter.  Nothing to get all that excited about, and certainly not as inspiring as I had thought it would be.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Reading this book gave me a perspective on the inside I had never considered, time. I have debated back and forth for and against the inmates. The gist is prison sucks, however should it be improved and paid by whom? This book engaged me intellectually and had me right there feeling the emotions of the protagonist and those around her in Danbury. I felt Ms. Kermanshah writing was honest and kept me engaged the past 2 weeks.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|He goes on and on about how he's spreading the word, but very little about the experience in heaven.  I gave up on the book about 3/4 of the way through.  I don't recommend it.

B00DY9X0QA|5.0|I ordered the CD here from Japan in anticipation of a later U.S. release.  The entire recital is found here and what an occasion.  I've seen quite a few contest winners and &#34;next big thing&#34; artists but that night in February was a totally different experience.  I encountered a young artist who's playing reaching deep into the heart of the music.  From Trifonov's tone, to his ability to sing phase after phrase without exaggeration, he's already a compete artist in every way.<br /><br />Listen to the Scriabin to start. A piece pretty much &#34;owned&#34; by Sviatoslav Richter, deserves to be heard under Trifonov's hands.  You feel the water, mist and song-like construction of the first movement.  And the 2nd leads to a fast, yet clear and well structured finale that captivates you until the end.  Get this disc!  You won't be disappointed!
0545101417|5.0|Audio version read very well. Voices are done really well. Story is great. Can't wait to get to book three.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The first Stephen King book I ever read was &#34;The Stand&#34; and been totally in awe of this man ever since. Love where his mind takes a person through his writing. Am now going to have to re-read &#34;the Shining&#34; since I read it in the eighties!!!!!
B00EVU3T26|1.0|There is an entire genre of Hollywood movies which consist of remakes of better European movies. You take a movie with good reviews (The Vanishing, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). You have a talentless screenwriter ruin the script and assign it to a hack director. You multiply the budget by ten and then you sit back and wonder why the reviews are so bad. These movies almost always stink and this one is no exception.<br /><br />Based on a much better (but no classic) French movie called, in English, &#34;Love Crime,&#34; this movie tells the story of rivalry of a senior ad executive and her assistant that arises when the senior executive steals the idea of her assistant. Like most French movies, the movie is worth watching, first, because the writing, like most French movies, treats its viewers like adults. The screenwriter doesn't insert into his movie dialogue that no one has ever uttered in the history of the spoken word because he trusts the movie's viewers to make inferences and guides them to the assumptions they need to make in order to make the movie realistic.<br /><br />The second failure of Hollywood is that no one there knows how grown-ups behave. This is because there are no adults in Hollywood. Rachel McAdams is an adequate actor in light comedy playing ingénues, but she doesn't have a clue how to behave like an employee in an office, let alone a high powered business executive. In fairness to Ms. McAdams, almost no one else in Hollywood does either. Anyone who has spent any time in an office will find the dialogue totally implausible. In contrast, Ms. Scott Thomas is completely believable as a senior executive in Love Crimes  and the office scenes were written by someone who either spent time in an office or has enough of an imagination to figure out how office workers behave.<br /><br />Why does Hollywood keep proving to us that they produce a third rate product.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Easy read and great coming-of-age story. Told in first person, this tale puts the reader into the main character's shoes quite convincingly. You won't want to put this one down after you start!

B00FEAZGDC|5.0|Didn't drag at all..  a very heart warming story...  something every choir director should require their choirs to watch.. I know I will
B009NXD6JM|2.0|I had never seen this classic movie, so I decided to watch it one day. It was obviously made for another time, and my feminist sensibilities didn't last but 1/2 hour.  &#34;Clueless hooker with a heart of gold&#34; isn't a character that I want to spend any time with. I know that I am stepping all over the toes of people who love both movies, but I don't like this movie for the same reason that I don't like &#34;Pretty Woman.&#34;  The main character of each is not worthy of respect or admiration.
B00288KNJU|5.0|we fell in love with Neil's writing style and this is a great complimentary movie to his book of the same title

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Technical quality:  This Bluray edition is superb in picture and sound quality -- especially on today's 55-Inch plus digital TV's.<br /><br />The movie: A few items that particularly interested me:<br />1.) The tribal influence on each region;<br />2.) That the British and French tried to divvy up Syria;<br />3.) The desolate landscape of much of the area.<br /><br />This movie fascinated my wife and me -- both in the brilliance of its (Bluray) production and the current relevance of its story.

0061950726|3.0|I liked this book that parallels the story of a young girl sent west on an orphan train from New York City in 1929 and a present-day Native American teenage girl who has struggled in the modern foster care system.  I think Kline does an excellent job showing us how Niamh Power and these destitute orphaned children, both numb and frightened, must have felt as they traveled and met up with their matches, which were often far from perfect.  Molly Ayer's present-day story of a rebellious, Goth girl whose father has died and whose mother is addicted to drugs is somehow less powerful, but provides a necessary structure to the story.  Molly meets ninety-one year-old Niamh, now named Vivian, when she is assigned to a community service punishment for stealing a book.  The two form a friendship as Molly helps Vivian sort through her attic and together they relive Vivian's story.<br /><br />I liked Vivian's story very much.  I think Kline is great when she describes Vivian's feelings and her desperate situation.  It is very easy to imagine these children and their simple desire to live in a home where they are wanted, or at least fed and clothed and treated kindly.  It's somehow both shocking and understood that these orphans don't always get that.<br /><br />I did not feel as drawn into Molly's story.  Her character reminds me too much of Velvet Hoon in Wally Lamb's The Hour I First Believed, and, fair or not, that made her seem less original.  I had trouble understanding why stealing a library book would potentially send Molly to \\"juvie,\\" but I suppose Kline needed to create this event to get the story rolling.<br /><br />Molly's transformation is also somewhat unbelievable and her Google search skills certainly tie up a lot of loose ends.  I'm also not sure how it is that Molly is able to buy or get a laptop, given her situation, but it comes in handy for the internet searches.  Her quick friendship with Vivian seems a little forced to me as well.<br /><br />All in all, however, I enjoyed the book.  It's a look into a time that, because of the changes and struggles in those years, is full of stories.ever, I enjoyed the book.  It's a look into a time that, because of the changes and struggles in those years, is full of stories.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|I love these hidden object games that allow me to create and renovate.I have created fish tanks,renovated old houses and this one lets you refrubish a room. Fun for me!
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|Pretty interesting hidden object app. has lots of options and mini games to add to replayability value.  nice graphics too.  I find it interesting and fun.  at first I was shocked at how tiny the screen image is but the game was so fun I squinted for around four games till I noticed the zoom button in the upper right corner. doh!  my only wish is that the objects were more hidden or camouflaged.<br /><br />all in all a pretty good game.
B00FVS3RZQ|2.0|This is for AOD not for the show. Keep hitting the purchase button but keeps coming back error. I don't have cable because I don't have time to waste in my life I consider waiting for this to be fixed a waste of time
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|We enjoyed watching it with 3 children, ages 12, 9 and 6. Great graphics, recommend watching it in H D.
B00EYE0ECW|1.0|Downloaded this App because I was having trouble<br />getting to Google maps on my 1.5 yr. old<br />Kindle Fire.  This item was no help at all and actually did not work.<br />Got rid of the app after a couple of hours of struggling with it.<br />I guess I will just have to use my PC to get<br />to Google maps.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A little different story, as I read a lot, this was refreshing. It Kept  my interest and was written well.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Horror at it's best. A psychological roller coaster that plays on everyone's worst fears. Jessica Lange is amazing. Always leaves you wanting more.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I first got one of these watches in black a few months ago. That watch was sent back (Amazon has a very good return policy) because it didn't keep very good time and the watch ticked very loud which bothered me as I sleep while wearing the watch. Because I have a small wrist (it's a small watch) and I wanted an automatic, I got one in blue sometime later. This watch was totally silent, kept very good time, and, in short, was everything I was looking for.This watch (in black again) is somewhere in between. It makes a very little ticking noise and keeps pretty good time (owning automatics has made me a little mote lax in time keeping standards). In short, you can get a very nice cheap automatic in this Seiko model, you just may have to send one or two back is all.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|If you like TWD too you know what I'm talking about.  Season 3 was so good; as were Season 1 and 2.  I almost gave up on this show, but it's probably the best show on TV - sci-fi, horror, drama, whatever the genre.
B00E66QPCG|4.0|sorting it out<br />will review and continue with the information provided<br />i am looking forward to using ideas and<br />persuing new formats provided in book
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|A small thing, but it arrived without a sleeve as advertised.<br />Now the only one of my 3D Marvel Superhero movie collection without a sleeve.<br /><br />Otherwise all as it should be.
1451626096|5.0|This story, based on truth, was very interesting and engrossing. It shows that, although women did not have the power of men in those days, they did have power through their influence--and maybe &#34;witchcraft.&#34; I loved the story and it caused me to do some of my own study of English history of that period.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|It is the most interesting serie I ever seen, since 24. I am waiting fot the third season!!!!!<br />Do you know when is starting?
B0092C9NDW|5.0|Just as mostly all of Samuel L Jackson's movies are, this one is just as good. Full of excitement. I loved it.
B006678VWA|5.0|It was a nice price and came promptly, in great shape.  I have not yet attempted to use the digital copy which expired per the printing on the case, but it was not a purchasing factor for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|truly a book that makes you think about decisions in life and how it effects you later in life and how easily things could have turned out way different than you expected or could have dreamed about
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This is the full set of movies with the original cast, and includes a special interview/discussion disk with members of the original cast & members of The Next Generation.  Each DVD is in a slim jewel case & is labelled.  There are no liner notes - do you really need them ?  The box has a lovely emblem as pictured that is actually a 3D lenticular lens - an unexpected & wonderful bonus.  If you are thinking about buying these DVDs, you are already a fan & I don't need to convince you.  I bought this boxed set on the occasion of the NASA announcement that V-ger had indeed left our solar system.  Let us hope that the rest of our future is as bright & wonderful as Star Trek has taught us it might be !  LLAP.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Steinbeck's best work, at a good price on Amazon for the Kindle edition, but......This was billed as &#34;annotated&#34;, and indeed there are footnote indicators throughout the text, but they aren't &#34;live&#34;. You have to switch back and forth between the text and the notes in the back of the book using the locator. A properly annotated Kindle edition should toggle back and forth between the text and the notes. The idea is to facilitate easy reference to the notes, and this edition does not do it.
0689504764|5.0|I read this to my 3 yr. old twin grandchildren at least twice a day during our two week trip to the beach.  They memorized it after a few readings and recited it along with me.  The illustrations were cute.  I have bought copies to give to friends for Christmas and the twins have chosen this book as a birthday gift for their school library.
B00CKYIENY|5.0|I'm not &#34;literary&#34; enough to do this book justice in a critical review, so suffice to say the book is a must read for any person interested in mores and manners of the upwardly mobile in English society 200 years ago. I just loved it. On the down side, this is advertised as &#34;annotated&#34; but the annotations are not &#34;live&#34;--that is, one cannot just click on the superscript and be taken directly to the reference or footnote. Instead, you have to first book mark the end matter where the notes reside, and then tediously plow through the footnotes looking for the one you want. A Kindle edition should make it easy to switch back and forth between text and back matter by simply selecting the superscript. This edition does not do that.
B002RI9MWA|4.0|It was a pleasure to read the gentile Indian (Pakistan) English of the novel.<br />The tale itself is full of suspense and insights into both Western and Oriental<br />life.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It leads you quickly and sometimes to the obvious conclusion, only to find<br />that the obvious is not quite so obvious. Looking forward to the four following in the series. Kudos, Susan Kiernan- Lewis!
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|A very interesting (at least for those that like the game of baseball and probably for those that don't as well) movie, well-done, and maybe except for some mild language (struggling to even remember where that came into play) something that the whole family could watch.  A very good job by Mr. Pitt and especially by Mr. Jonah Hill.  The fact that it's based largely on life within the Oakland A's baseball club makes it that much more interesting.  Whether you're a baseball person that loves or hates the statistical analysis system or someone that could care less about the Great American Pastime and just likes a good movie, this fills the bill.  Very enjoyable, will watch it again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Suc<br /><br />Such a fabulous,  well-made, well-acted series. Really can't wait for the fourth season to start in January. Streaming quality is great too. Even so, sometimes I do wish that they would not go so far in the script not to offend our modern sensibility regarding class-relations in that period
B009GEYX5E|5.0|my daughter loves it!! she bought the camera for 5 bucks at an antique store and cant keep film in it!!
B0053O89WY|5.0|The show is hilarious! I have the discs from season 1 to season 5. Even though I've already seen all of the episodes on TV, I enjoyed watching them all over again on DVD. The characters are brilliant in more ways than one. This show will become a classic without a doubt.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|While creative and interesting at first, got tired of the voice of the child throughout.  I actually did not care much what happened to these characters after about half way through.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I loved the Pillars of the Earth and I absolutely loved this book.  Ken Follett is an excellent author!  Read his other books!
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Thought this would be a suspensful read - not so. It IS interesting to see Nazi Germany through the eyes of children. Unfortunately the voice of &#34;death&#34;, the narrator, gets cumbersome and even tiring. Character develpoment very good, some descriptions very creative but too many far flung metaphors.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I feel this is a book for the times we are living in!! I realized how violent our interactions are even if we think we are speaking compassionately.
B002G917ZK|1.0|I finally saw this movie and it was NOT a good movie.  It is supposed to be a romantic comedy but there was nothing romantic or funny about this movie.  It was dull and boring.  Don't believe those 5 star reviews. This movie should not be considered a classic.
B00F35B8F8|1.0|Our five year mission: to rehash old story lines and reboot old characters.<br />To go where true artists have already boldly gone before.<br /><br />What a waste of time.
B0013ND30M|5.0|What toddler or 66 year old grandparent wouldn't like this?  It makes a perfect babysitting tool...I know every word by heart!
B004529NLG|5.0|This film doesn't care about acting or plot, it's just amazing dance scenes with crazy cool effects, especially the 3D, and a cheesy feel good story.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Not sure if my grandkids like this more than grandma does?  We watch Disney movies over and over and over!  Grandma could do animation for every part for she has every word memorized!  This is a definite must for entertaining kids from 2 to 66!
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|I thought there would be more interaction with the game itself.  There is too much need to  it power.  Even when u do it is not discounted enough. You should be able to get energy for free. Maybe more diamonds roo
B006ZZAN60|5.0|The voice, the production values, the cinematography...beautiful in every respect.  this one's a keeper.  You will want to play this often.  If your friends don't like it, send them home without dessert.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Matthew McConaughey puts in an outstanding performance as Mud.  Mud's situation is tenuous and his plans as they evolve seem out of the realm of even remote possibility.  The story is engaging and makes you want to believe that he could succeed just through his dogged naive determination.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Many people won't like this movie because it's a Woody Allen movie.  Many people will LOVE this movie because it's a Woody Allen movie.  The nice thing about Midnight in Paris is that there's something here for everyone...romance, mystery, comedy, a pinch of sci-fi fantasy...you just can't go wrong!  It is stunningly beautiful in its cinematography, score, and standout performances by everyone in the cast.  Woody said that Owen Wilson was the one and only person for the lead character, and I wholeheartedly agree.  This is, without a doubt, Owen's best role in any film, because it shows his remarkable range.  He is as three-dimensional as the world he finds himself in while strolling down the streets of Paris at midnight.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I haven't even opened the movies but I think I'll like it. I'm kind of slow to watch the movies but at least I'll have them in my collection.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|The only complaint I have about The Avengers (besides the endless Disney previews you can't simply bypass) is that it's too long, in my estimation, by about 15 or 20 minutes.  I realize that there are a lot of characters, plots, and sub-plots to juggle here, but by the time the team gets assembled, it's time for them to flex their muscles and kick the enemy into the next galaxy.  They, of course, do that; it just takes a long time to get the job done.  (Otherwise, I would have given this one five stars.)  Developing a believable plot line for this time of film with such a plethora of characters is not easy.  Kudos to the production crew for pulling it all together.  A fun ride!
B000RZIGVS|3.0|I haven't opened them yet but I think the original series will be better. Only problem I had was that I ordered wide screen version but I received full screen version.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The Good Wife, is built on an &#34;old&#34; hook, but the twists and turns, subplots, and character development continue to keep me interested. Gotta start with the beginning of the series, though.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|I love the Gilmore Girls and was very happy to find it on Amazon. I can now watch all the episodes.
1781162646|4.0|I got this book because I love Stephen, except for From A Buick 8. That book was pointless. Anyway, back to this book. I thought it would be more of a horror story. No I didn't notice the mystery tag when I ordered it. It turned out to be more like Stand By Me. It was a good story and I'm glad I read it because turned out to be a very good mystery in the end.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is an excellent book. Straightforward and simple approach, but definitely thoughtful and eye opening. It gives me a new perspective on how to approach a relationship.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Im glad he started turning somewhat normal.  I was afraid she would turn into super pervy kinda girl. Will probably read the third now
B0063IH60K|1.0|Would've been great if there were NO ADS.  As it stands, I've had to delete the game because ads took over my game playing.  I spent more time closing out (& hunting for ways to get back to my game) ads than I spent playing the game.  There are ads before & after every game you play.  It's become ridiculous!<br /><br />As for the game itself, it's good.  However, the prominence of the ads in the game make this app worthless.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|This was extremely well done.  I thought this would be another low budget sci-fi flick to pass some time, but this actually blew me away.  I'm not a HALO game player, so the references in the beginning and end are probably lost on me, but nevertheless, this was a very good movie.  I would watch this again, and highly recommend it.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|This really is one of the greatest shows the BBC has ever done.  Haunting. hard to stop thinking about.  Tragic and Great!!!
0965593193|5.0|As a history and science geek, Singh tickled my fancy and engrossed me in the Ping pong ball journey of mathematicians and centuries of discovery until the final proof of Fermat's enigma. Given Andrew Wiles use of modern mathematics to resolve the riddle, one can only imagine Fermat's actual proof hinted at in the margins of his book.<br /><br />Mr. Singh writes with masterful prose that borders on art while educating the reader in great depth to the richness of mathematics.  Singh continues his great skill in The Big Bang and The Code Book.<br /><br />Loved this book.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Lots of different rooms. Got bingo got slots. collect items to finish the rooms. I started playing the game could not  connect by facebook (my fault)  and it wiped out my scores that I had. Then they made things a little more difficult to achieve and the cost to play some slot went up,  more points to play,  which I can appreciate otherwise you go through all the rooms and nothing to achieve.  lots of complainers in the chat rooms but you can turn it off.  I get a lot of weather reports from different States and countries which is interesting. Games tend to have problems when new games introduced. but they fix them quickly. People complaining think they should be getting collections sooner. if they played bongo in the real world they would realize there are many instances you go home after never winning a thing many times. It is a game of chance. I have had a few days where I have had a lot of luck so it makes those days more special.  Thanks Bongo Blitz you keep me entertained. Do not like the pop ups each time on the newer rooms.  few times okay but every time?
B006CUDDUG|5.0|If you saw the movie with Richard Burton you know this is an intricate plot.  Pay attention. A great work and maybe le Carre's best. You will thoroughly enjoy this yarn.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|Too hard for me to figure out.  I was not able to get past two items and it drove me crazy!
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|it sucks that you have to keep buying stuff on it and paying for extra features... don't buy, take your kids outside better
1608870081|5.0|This book is fascinating. I cant write down the emotions i got  turning the pages. I appreciate the author. Also very nice gift for potterheads.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun.... free..... great game..HD...moving horse Is easy . Love this game very much. Wish I could muck out out stall and groom and wash my self but ok no errors don't have to report. Wish I could take pic any where but ok could use more mini game
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Electronic punk to lose your head to the pulse of the club. Fantastic album, criminally underrated. People dislike this album for its repitition, but it contains the real bangers of Daft's ALIVE set. Unique and brilliantly rough, that brings out the robot in Daft Punk.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I read Eleanor and Park first and as soon as I saw that she was coming out with another book, I just bought it sight unseen. I don't regret it, this book is so funny and heartfelt and awesome. I love the humor and snark. Well done.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Ann Hathaway proved it again that she is not only extremely cute and sexy, but also an outstanding actress.  Since I am dealing with my own Parkinsons.
0375869026|4.0|my daughter had to read this during the summer for her next grade level. she ended up not being able to put the book down. she really enjoyed it!
B003B0JLYW|5.0|The book is very inspiring. I am still reading it . However my experience with the Amazon seller was horrible. He stated he was selling a paperback when in fact was a hardcover. That would not be a problem if I had not been sending it to a jail facility where they do not accept hardcovers.  What really bothered me was that he was aware of this tidbit and even wrote a letter to the jail mail room asking them to please let the book go thru that it was not available in paperback yet.  Needless to say, I did not appreciate the false advertizing-seller/amazon holding on to my money for 3 weeks and making my son wait for a book that never came.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|this was a really great raid I enjoyed reading it over the weekend I'm reading the entire series that way there my weekend guilty pleasure books!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read the short story when it was first published, but missed the novel version. I thoroughly enjoyed reading got now and have gone on to read the remaining books in the series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was amazing! Heartfelt and very great I would read it over and over again. It's the best and I can relate do to the fact I had osteosarcoma cancer.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Can't beat the price or quality. Fits the iPhone 4s very well and provides sufficient protection for the phone. The screen protector works well and easy to install.
B00884GR0W|3.0|every time I get on since the new update it cuts off the app every few sec. I have to keep saving or else ill lose all of my progress.
0393325172|5.0|I wish they would produce a follow-on movie. I was surprised how much I enjoyed watching this movie. Highly recommended.
B00498XRPE|5.0|Excellent cast<br />Great acting<br />Good script<br />Well thought out plot<br />And after 2+ decades it still looks good and not dated
B00EXVZW6E|1.0|A hidden objects game without zoom.  A developer who designs a game that requires you to find things on a small screen without zoom capability does not have the one thing most important to a developer; an understanding of their audience.
B00CTKHXFO|3.0|I got this video game because I never actually played metal gear as a kid so I thought I missed out. really I don't like the game play itself but it's fun and adventurous so I will play it when I have the time
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed everything about this movie!  The acting was great, the visuals were fabulous.  Thought this was a wonderful adaptation.
B00CTT9646|2.0|There are those that hate the new Trek movies, and those that think they're great. I fall into the latter group. I think the alternate timeline idea works here, especially given that the original series, as well as the follow up series' all dabbled with it in one fashion or another, so it's not like it's unheard of in the Trek universe.<br /><br />Though not the Khan we all know from the series and The Wrath of Khan movie, I think Benedict Cumberbatch did a good job with the role. He was cunning, clever, and almost oozed evil from the pores at times. At the same time, he portrayed a man willing to go to extraordinary means to save his people. He was believable in both aspects.<br /><br />If the review was just based on the movie, I'd give it 5 stars. Unfortunately, I have to take points off for the horrible, horrible piece of trash foisted off on us by Paramount, Amazon and QMx.<br /><br />Billed as a Limited Edition, and carrying a premium price, one would expect that the phaser replica included in the set to be of premium quality. One would further expect this due to QMx (Quantum Mechanix) being involved. Ordinarily, QMx, by most accounts, produces a superior product that they actually stand behind. Not in this case. Not only was the build quality of the phaser replica far below standards, QMx completely refused any sort of support, telling me to talk to Amazon instead. They also went as far as to deny any responsibility for the lack of quality control, stating such things were out of their hands.<br /><br />Some of the defects encountered were:<br /><br />- Spotty paint jobs, with blurs, streaks and in some cases parts missed entirely.<br />- Parts not lined up properly before being glued or welded, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance.<br />- The spindle or hub on which the phaser barrel rotates not being aligned properly, resulting in the barrel not turning at all, sticking, jamming and/or facing off at an angle when 'locked' in place by the 'active lockingmechanism'.<br /><br />Oddly enough, QMx claims to have used the same molds that Paramount used when filming the movies to make these. Given the subpar build quality, I question the validity of that particular statement.<br /><br />Overall, I'd have to say stay away from this particular product. If you're interested in the movie itself, there are several other options available. Given the premium cost of this set, and the ridiculously cheap build quality and lack of quality control or support from the manufacturer of the phaser replica, this set is absolutely not worth the price being charged by Amazon.
1594746036|2.0|Extremely disappointing read as the story started out with such promise, but then proceeded down the absolutely most cliched path possible.  I'd recommend only for tweens that don't have a lot of experience with reading.  Could be good for getting the younger reader on board with reading because of the fun pictures, but definitely not for adults on any level.
B000002GYW|5.0|Nothing new but the editing, which improves it considerably. I had this album back in the day and am happy to relive it.
B004JRVQX0|1.0|I bought Pro Tools 10 from my school because it had quite a big discount. I forgot one detail though. It came with this wonderful product called the iLok. Well I've had it for less than a year, and now my iLok no longer functions. I turned on my computer yesterday (Saturday) to do some work in Pro Tools, and I kept getting the \\"missing iLok authorization\\" error. I looked at my computer to find a stunning light show coming from my iLok. I was awestruck by this dazzling show. This flashing blue light was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.<br /><br />The problem though, was I could no longer open Pro Tools...you know...the same program I was just using Wednesday...just 3 days ago. Now I have $400+ worth of useless software on my hard drive because my iLok would rather be a strobe light.<br /><br />So, I went to the iLok website to see what my options were. Surely there was something I could do! Their support was easy enough to find, and eventually I found the Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) request page. This is where I learned some more awesome news! My iLok is still under warranty! But wait...there's more! I get to pay a $49.95 \\"license recovery fee.\\"<br /><br />...<br /><br />What?<br /><br />I have to pay more money to replace their product that failed within the first year of my owning it? For a device that should be labeled as defective? I treated this thing like a baby. If I wasn't using Pro Tools, it was capped, and in its own container. And it still broke. Its great that it's still under warranty, oh but wait, I still have to pay in order to keep my licenses... What is the point of even having a warranty if you are still going to charge for a replacement? On top of that I have to wait anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks in order to get a replacement, but I don't have a week; I needed it yesterday.<br /><br />\\"But wait!\\" you may say, \\"Don't they have Zero Downtime Coverage? Can't you get temporary licenses while you wait for your new strobe light?!\\" Well of course! For an additional $130 all my wishes could come true!  ...So now you're telling me that if I want to use my program today to do my school work, I have to spend a total of $179? That's nearly half what I spent on the software itself!<br /><br />As of the time I am writing this, I have not completed the RMA request form. I have not replaced my iLok. I have not been able to open Pro Tools. Most importantly, I haven't even started my assignment. I refuse to give them more of my money so I can use software that I have already paid $400+ to get. I'd rather stare at a useless Pro Tools icon on my desktop than give them more money. As of this moment, I am never buying another ilok, nor am I buying any software that requires an iLok. I will be switching to different software when I can afford it.<br /><br />If you don't have time to read the above:<br />I read the reviews. I knew the horror stories. But I didn't listen. This product is terrible. It is cheaply made, and it is possibly the worst method of digital rights management (DRM) I hvae ever come across. It is outright extortion, and it does nothing but punish honest people who legitimately purchase software. My $400+ software has been rendered useless because this cheap piece of plastic has failed, and I refuse to give them any more of my money or time to fix it. If I could give less stars, I would, but sadly, 1/5 will have to do.<br /><br />My words of advice would be this. Do NOT buy software that uses the iLok. Do not purchase an iLok. Do some research. Find a good alternative, because there are plenty of alternatives out there.
B008JFUO72|1.0|The packaging was really nice and colorful and the case seemed sturdy.  I should have let it be but no I insisted on watching the movie.  Big mistake. There was no plot just a series of plot holes flying in loose formation.  The actors were directed by a man who should have stuck with 7-11 training films.  He clearly knew nothing about the franchise and in fact by the end he had literally ripped the heart out of Iron Man and discarded it. Not one character mattered and neither did their poorly explicated actions.  If only Amazon had directed this turkey.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT HIS JORNEY TO THE AFTERLIFE  AND NOT HIS HOSPITAL EXPERENCE . THE BOOK JUMPED AROUND TO MUCH  IT WAS GOOD BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Relevance to modern lifestyle, hits all the right points, and weaves in history, pop culture, and heartache in just the right amounts.  Well written without pretension. Characters are just like people you know. The plot is engaging from the beginning.  Well done.  My first Liane Moriarty, won't be my last..
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I understand that this book has become a Showtime Television series.  But for heaven's sake don't avoid the book because of that.  Have the fun of reading the book and then viewing the shows.  There is something about Piper's first person narrative that is quite captivating and you should not lose that.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This is the story of a young woman (Piper) who for an act of youthful stupidly (carrying drug money) many years later is arrested and charged with a crime.  Piper's attorney warns her of the danger of a trial and works out a plea arrangement that calls for her to serve two years in prison.<br /><br />It is natural to wonder what jail is really and truly like, and Piper who is a nice middle class girl waiting to marry her nice boyfriend, is going away to jail for a indiscretion made a long ago .  Among the most interesting parts of the book illustrate how prison authorities systematically take away prisoners' dignity, and how the prisoners suffer at the whim of guards and other administrators.<br /><br />Also quite interesting is how the prison is governed by certain inmate rules that are as binding, if not more so, than those of the jailers.  As you might expect, there is a great difference in the crimes and sentences that bring these women together.  Some serve only a very short sentence due to some slight parole violation, while others will spend the rest of their lives in prison.<br /><br />Later in the book Piper shares her thoughts about the high incarceration rates for drug addicts.  This should make us all realize that beyond question the war on drugs has not been won and perhaps it will always be with us.  But drug users commit many crimes, some quite violent, that make a release and treat program for such inmates a hard sell in any community.
B001P06GX4|5.0|THIS IS A FUN GAME AND WE LIKE IT, IT USES YOUR BRAIN TOO. Need 6 more words, this is stupid, and makes me not want to comment anymore.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|In brief, if you are a Star Trek fan sooner or later this is one movie you are going to want to own.  The story line is quite intriguing but in truth, the interactions of the major characters and the special effects are what the fans are looking for.  The effects really play well in Blu-ray with a high resolution television and a good sound system to boot.  You also get a DVD and a digital copy in this combo offering.<br /><br />***************************************************************<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />Cross-referencing Khan, the duality of Spock, the daring-do, winning against the odds, saving the Federation once again, and the nice plot twist and turns make for a fun movie.  I know that this is really not a spoiler but better save than sorry!

B004LE90ZC|3.0|The English Patient is a story about four lives that converge in a war torn part of Italy. All four characters have been profoundly touched by the war and must now rebuild their lives and move on. There is the anonymous and mysterious english patient who is coming to terms with a deceitful past, a young nurse who in order to numb the pain of loss becomes obsessed with nursing the patient back to health, a retired thief who has gone through life with no thought given to where his actions might lead him and a young idealistic bomb specialist who has his ideals turned upside down. Not only are these characters dealing with the aftermath of an external war but there are many inner demons they are all battling, histories they must confront and truths they must question.<br /><br />Ondaatje writes with powerful and captivating intensity but due to his poetic style the text is often weirdly and uncomfortably fragmented and because of this I found the book to be a laborious read. This poeticism made it hard to connect to the characters even when their emotions were described in detail.  The book is filled with beautiful and vivid descriptions but it seems that more attention was given to pretty writing than to a substantial plot.  What I enjoyed most about The English Patient was Ondaatje's handling of the Identity theme. He makes you think about how identity is constantly changing and that a person's identity is a complex mix of their history, how they perceive themselves, how others perceive them and the lies they tell themselves in order to be able to live with themselves.

Amazon has not YET developed the application for my phone.

B00DPH7QFM|4.0|After exiting Deep Purple (again) in 1993, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore reformed Rainbow, and recorded the album [[ASIN:B000024J76 The Stranger In Us All]] (1994).  This DVD captures Blackmore's Rainbow in a 1995 performance in Dusseldorf, for the German program Rockaplast.  Apparently heavily bootlegged through the years, Eagle Rock has done a great job of fully restoring the video, which looks terrific.  Out of balance in a just few spots, the sound mix is also excellent.<br /><br />The performance is nicely edited, with good coverage of the band.  The crucial element is that the mercurial Blackmore is engaged, amiable, animated, and in tip top form, making for an ideal concert experience, which should be appreciated by most fans.  At magical moments, Ritchie's fingers seem to dance off the scalloped frets of his Stratocaster.<br /><br />In addition to Blackmore, the band features singer Doogie White, Paul Morris on keyboards, Greg Smith on bass, and Chuck Burgi on drums, with Candice Night providing additional vocals.  With the exception of Burgi, the same personnel recorded The Stranger in Us All, and the album is very well represented in this performance.<br /><br />White is a powerful singer, with good stage presence.  He really shines on the Strangers material, and his voice also seems suited to the Dio and Turner era Rainbow songs.  He doesn't seem to be quite as good, on the Deep Purple material, but he does a fine job overall.  At various times, Paul Morris steps up and impresses with some inspired playing, that complements Blackmore in a fashion somewhat reminiscent of the way Jon Lord did in Purple.<br /><br />Selections from The Stranger In Us All include, \\"Wolf To the Moon\\", \\"Black Masquerade\\", \\"Still I'm Sad\\", \\"Ariel\\", \\"Hunting Humans\\", \\"Too Late For Tears\\", and the epic \\"Hall Of The Mountain King\\".  The band really seems to be going for the throat performing the new material, and Blackmore appears to be particularly engaged and animated.<br /><br />The setlist also includes \\"Spotlight Kid\\", \\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\", a medley of \\"Long Live Rock 'n' Roll\\" and \\"Black Night\\", a sedate version of \\"Temple Of The King\\", and a medley of \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" and \\"Perfect Strangers\\".  The performance closes strongly, with \\"Burn\\", and \\"Smoke On The Water\\".<br /><br />Ritchie Blackmore has since turned to performing renaissance music, with his wife Candice Night in Blackmore's Night.  This appearance by Rainbow on Rockaplast, could be one of the last recorded performances by the Man in Black, in the hard rock genre, for some time to come.  Presenting the band in a most favorable light, this performance should certainly not to be missed, by any fan of this incarnation of Rainbow.e setlist also includes \\"Spotlight Kid\\", \\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\", a medley of \\"Long Live Rock 'n' Roll\\" and \\"Black Night\\", a sedate version of \\"Temple Of The King\\", and a medley of \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" and \\"Perfect Strangers\\".

B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Dumb Ways to Die is a cute game about keeping each colorful character safe. Once you get a certain number of points, you unlock a video. The video has a great song showing the characters not being careful and getting killed. The game is really a set of many minigames where you prevent what happened in the video. Even though the killing part sounds a bit violent, the whole game is very cheerful. Metro Trains brought this game to you to show you to be safe around trains. Some of the characters you save are in danger of trains.<br />It's really a great game, and there's a great message behind it.<br />This game can get repetitive, but you are motivated by unlocking new characters.<br />It's free and doesn't need wifi, so why not get it? :)
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  In fact, I could barely put it down and read it rather quickly.  It held my interest and I never guessed who the killer was.  A good read.
0062255657|5.0|The book is a strange one to work through. The &#34;voice&#34; of the narrator flicks between the grown up and the 7 year old child. The books blends wonder and cruelty into a magical mixture that is breathtakingly beautiful. The childish acceptance of the fact a pond can be an ocean and a child can be eternal draws the reader into the story. The only niggle I have with the book is that I found the ending a bit weak, but maybe I was searching for another ending, a fairy tale happy ending whereas Gaiman has a more subtle finish
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I don't care for the sexual comments the one guy (played Woody on &#34;Cheers&#34;) makes.  That kept it from being a show that the whole family could enjoy. Nice twist at the end.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Really enjoyed the story.  Looking forward to the next book, which I have purchased. The author does a good job of drawing the reader into the story.
B00006AUIG|3.0|So what do I really think of Session 9?  My review title isn’t entirely honest just as “Session 9” isn’t entirely honest.  Perhaps my inner contrarian feels betrayed by all the glowing reviews here at amazon .  I thought this would be a truly disturbing horror film.  It turns out it was practically neither.  “Session 9” is pretty much just a psychological drama with a violent ending, just as “Silence of the Lamb” and “Se7en” are not really horror films.  Unlike those two films, “Session 9” wasn’t nearly as scary, violent, disturbing, well acted, or made.  That said; this film is not a major Hollywood production and I tend to give low budget films a break.  However, “Session 9” failed in ways many low budget films do not.  Let’s clear the dust on this.<br /><br />-STORY, STORY, STORY<br />One aspect of film making that does not require a big budget is creative story telling.  “Session 9” has a fairly disconnected story with facets that generate mood but don’t really move the story along.  In fact, the titular “sessions” (Clinical recordings of a murderer with multiple personalities) are pretty much unnecessary to the films ultimate ending though they are probably the scariest part of the film.  The basic premise around which the story revolves is a small crew of asbestos removal technicians who are assigned the task of cleaning up the hazardous material from a large facility in a ridiculously short amount of time. The guys spend a lot of time cleaning, joking, eating lunch, arguing, and wasting time snooping around.  Strangely, the boss says they’re making great progress (really?).  The story does have twist and turns (not particularly challenging ones) and a key figure that comes from nowhere.  Yet, I eventually gave up guessing who would turn the story towards mayhem since there were only a couple of options.  The red “hairing” was not particularly effective since the prime suspect quickly became obvious.<br /><br />-DON’T BREATHE THE ATMOSPHERE<br />As you may have already read, this film takes place in Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusetts; the true star of this film.  The best parts of the story are the moments of historical recollection concerning this building.  The true goings-on at Danvers were horrific and disturbing especially since they are true. The building, tight schedule, life threatening hazardous material, and friction among the crew all create a foreboding atmosphere.  This may well be the most effective part of the film.  Unfortunately it’s not enough to satisfy my need for a more challenging story.<br /><br />-DEFINE HORROR<br />So what constitutes a horror film?  Like “Se7en” and “Silence of the Lamb”, “Session 9” could be labeled a psychological thriller or drama.  I’m not going to argue what it is, but little happens in the first hour of the film to warrant the “Horror” tag.  I guess a film of this nature becomes horror when some audacious gore or violence occurs.  There is a sense of dread that hangs over the film due to the interpersonal tensions and the hazards of the job.  However, the violence comes way too late to ratchet up the requisite suspense or thrills I personally look forward to in horror films.  That said I have to view this as a low budget psychological drama with a violent end.  That doesn’t make this an inherently bad film; it just means I think marketing this film as a horror film is a bit disingenuous.<br /><br />-SAY SOMETHING SORT OF NICE<br />  A lot of people liked this film.  So I feel compelled to acknowledge the things this film did right.  Though many elements of the story were superfluous to the plot, the plot was actually pretty compelling.  I might have enjoyed this more as a short film (40 minutes or less).  As it is, I found the film to feel so padded with distractions and un-needed details that the plot became diluted.<br />  The Acting was mostly well executed.  After Danvers, Peter Mullen and David Caruso were the clear human stars of this film.  They did a good job of developing the air of uneasy doubt that dominates this film.  I really can't stand David Caruso, but he did a reasonable job as a slightly suspicious foremen.  The other actors did nothing to harm this film, were often entertaining, and served well as eventual victims.<br />The overall production values of this film were, at worst, adequate.  Considering that nearly the entire film was shot on the grounds of Danvers the creepy feel of the film was a given.  The cinematography was effective though usually unremarkable at telling the story and keeping the dark mood.<br /><br />-WHAT’S THE FINAL CALL?<br />I have issues with “Session 9” being hyped as a terrifying horror film when it’s more of a slow paced psychological drama.  It’s not a bad psychological drama, but I’ve seen better.  There are acts of grotesque violence and brutal killings (of which very little is seen).  Unfortunately most of these obscured acts happen in the last 15 minutes of the film.  The film has an uneasy atmosphere and lots of tension to go along with the meager violence.  Yet the execution of the plot is overlong and full of distractions that do little to move it along and prove to be nothing more than interesting distractions.  Rental is probably the way to go if you’re curious.  If you don’t expect a terrifying horror film, you just might enjoy it.<br /><br />-Story…........2.5 Stars<br />-Plot……......4 Stars<br />-Horror…..…2 Stars<br />-Acting…......3.5 Stars<br />-Hype factor..2 Stars<br /><br />Average…….2.8 Starsvid Caruso were the clear human stars of this film.

B00594XOZU|3.0|Like a lot of other people say kik is not working. This is a big problem for me b cuz my friends and I talk over kik. This girl that I think wants to be my friend talked and now I will never know. PLZ FIX. I GET MAD EASILY SO IF IT DOESN'T GET FIXED WHO KNOWS WHAT ILL DO. It was wonderful. Before this.
B004NELBPC|1.0|The news reported may be reliable, but the App is so bad you'll never know. It never works! This must be a feature of Huffington Post Apps, because I encountered the same problems with the download in the US.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|G5 folks did it again...lots if GREAT GRAPHICS, GREAT story line, GREAT hints, GREAT fun!  You gotta give this one a try.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|This is a great movie!  We loved all the effects and the magical fun... plus the revenge factor was pretty cool!  It is movies like this that renew the spirit of magic in children of all ages and make us want to learn to do it again -- interested in seeing it again -- and giving it a fresh look so it will never die.  I'm glad to have seen this movie. All kids interested in magic will LOVE this movie and kids who need a good hobby will enjoy this as well.  Parents beware:  Your kids will be asking for magic kits for Christmas after seeing this!  What could be more fun?
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is a great view into how music is made.  Not only do music fans see the often unexplored side of recording, we get the benefit of some great songs too.<br /><br />The movie is about how music was recorded before the digital age and how some musicians of late have sought to use that older technology not just because it sounds better, but because it forces more collaboration between bands mates, the producer and engineer.<br /><br />There seems to be no limit on what Dave Grohl can do, he sings, plays guitar, plays drums, writes songs, produces, narrates, and made this movie (gives a good Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech too! youtube it).  He is an amazing talent.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This is a great movie for all Trekkies -- which we are!  My husband and I love all Star Trek movies, series... it doesn't matter what Star Trek it is -- we will watch it.  We love SG1 and all the StarGate movies and series too.  Outerspace... the final frontier.  Who doesn't want to boldly go where no one has gone before!  I love how the characters grow and evolve in this and seeing where the all &#34;began.&#34;  It is in good keeping with the other movies and the original series.  Captain Kirk / William Shatner should be proud!
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|This book provides a well-thought out guide for families - the author mentions and explains some theories, but concentrates on providing motivation, tips and examples of how families in different situations can support raising children to be bi- or multi-lingual. The book is easy to read and shows lots of creative ways to develop an environment and situations where the minority language can be used on a regular basis. It aso shows that language learning does not have to be a large expense...I appreciate the list of sources of free and budget products/services/games available onlline. Thank you!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|My hubby and I really liked this movie.  We watched it two times in a row. There was so much action.  Iron Man grows up a bit in this movie, but his humor and fun attitude is still intact.  There are some surprises with his girl.  You'll have to see for yourself!  This movie is well worth the rent or purchase (if you want to own the series).  Who doesn't love the good guy?
B009C7ZQM4|2.0|I used this once and deleted it. I found the product not useful and wanting more than I wanted to give.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book.  Nothing flashy and can move slowly at times, but that fits the situation.  You will come to love the main character and be in awe at his ingenuity.
B00F8L2VO4|3.0|I got this because my daughter is learning French.  I just got bored with it. And had no real interest in learning French.  If  you want to learn  or bush up on your French, then this could be helpful.
B009M7G1PU|5.0|My classic book club  chose this title.  I loved it; it was more than a titillating book.  It developed its characters and accurately described the sociological environment of the times. It even had a realistic and satisfying ending.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|This is a great movie! I would definitely recommend it!! I got this for my boyfriend and he was so excited with it. One of his favorite Johnny Depp movies!
0545265355|5.0|I finally jumped on the bandwagon & ordered this after hearing about it for quite some time and every one was right... amazing series, completely worth the time! It is a great story that makes you think and lets your imagination run wild. Loved it!

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was never an avid reader as a kid. Kindle has made me want to read. The Kindle App for my phone gives me the opportunity to read anywhere. I love it.
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|I have always loved Kris Kristofferson, but to realized that he is 77 years old it just blows me away.  He was such a hunk in this movie, plus I think it might have saved his life.

B0040HO01Y|3.0|I feel that I will think more highly of this series as the characters develop, it's an engaging cast and storty line.
B009949RKC|4.0|Wanted to watch it again before the new one hits theaters. Always fun to watch a steven king movie again.  they never get old.
B0038LB4TE|5.0|The book started brilliantly with a fast paced first chapter.  I really enjoyed the subject matter and overall just found it a great read.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I WOULD RECOMMEND HEAT WAVE TO ANYONE WHO LOVES CRIME DRAMA. KEPT ME GOING TO THE VERY END. BEST EVER
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Really fun game that I found hard to put down.  Played well on my Kindle.  Definitely worth the money .and I will watch for a sequel to this game.
B00004YRQA|5.0|ps2 was cool and it was a deal because I remember memory cards use to cost up to $30 and up
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|RIPD was okay, just a little too cheesy for my taste. The way Jeff Bridges talks in this is a bit difficult to get used to as well.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Good family movie, shows family value, kids loves the colors and the different animals in it all around good movie
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|This is a fun kids movie that both adults and children can enjoy.  It's your basic caveman family cartoon. I don't think Nicolas Cage's voice was appropriate for the voice of the father, but maybe that's just me.
0307476073|4.0|I'm still in the process of reading the book but I'm enjoying it so far. It came quickly and I will finish it soon.  thanks
B008N5UX9M|3.0|If the album could have been done with Bruce Dickinson on vocals, I would probably have liked it more.<br />Maiden RIP? God, I hope not.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Thank you Mr. Mitchell for an enchanting time traveling saga with marvelous insight into the Human Condition and mastery of dialect and island lore! My spouse and I have watched the movie several times and reading the book absolutely highlighted your depth of research and unique depiction of the past and future.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|All the Wool books are awesome, exciting, and over much too soon.  A friend introduced me to the series and I was immediately addicted.  I felt the claustrophobia and nervousness of being underground in a silo while reading these stories.  The author does a nice job of detailing the mundane thoughts that pass through a person's numb mind during a stressful or dangerous moment.  Although each book is fairly short, I could easily connect with the characters and their situations.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|The upper levels get challenging.  My biggest complaint is that dragging my finger across the screen actually gets tiring.  If I were to describe the game in one word, it would be 'meh'.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Excellent all round except that it doesn't work in a hotel room where you have to enter a code on a page after connecting on wifi. I see a lot of people complaining about this and I truly believe Google will fix it soon. Also would be great to have more apps supporting Chromecast and I hope that developers make this happen.
B00E7SFAAG|1.0|This might be a great game for kids who are accustomed to more action-filled games.  Without a map showing what obstacle is coming up next, I was stuck more than once.  If I can't get the gist of a game within the first few rounds, I drop it.  This one, I dropped.
B009MO57H6|5.0|Great movie, nicely packed and well protected. This movie fill in of all my Resident Evil movies. Having them all is like having a soap opera of your own or a theater style TV series. It starts exactly where it was left off.
B00FHAB3HW|4.0|love almost every single song on the album.  even the few slow ones are good. loving me some money atm
B00445YMME|5.0|This is such a great show.  My whole family loves it!  It's absolutely hilarious and every character is funny in their own way.  Great show for all!
7119005901|5.0|I have heard that to truly understand Chinese culture, one must read The Three Kingdoms.  That may be, but this epic is a masterpiece of literature in any language.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in the classics of world literature.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The reason I purchased this style of headphone was to block out the noise my stereotypical cube-mate at work makes - slurping coffee, talking to himself, loud phone conversations, etc.  All in a nearly silent room with no white noise.  I was having to turn my Bose ear-buds up to uncomfortable levels to be able to concentrate on my work.  With these headphones, the noise is cut down to a tolerable level without having to have my music at hearing-loss levels.  I don't hear any more slurping or lip smacking but the phone conversations do tend to bleed through a little.<br /><br />As for quality, these headphones provide great clarity - better than anything I currently own or that I tried in the store (though there could be many issues with the display models, so take that for what it's worth).  Like others have mentioned, there was a break-in period for a couple of days where the low end seemed nearly non-existent, but now they sound nice and balanced.<br /><br />The headphones are also pretty comfortable.  I typically wear them a couple hours at a time and my ears don't get hot.  Sometimes they do put too much pressure on my glasses but taking breaks cuts that way down.  The longer cord is great for mobility within my cube and it's coiled so it doesn't get tangled up in the various junk I have scattered around.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala is an inspiration to not only the youth of this world, but also to all women who work hard to change the world in order to make it a better place. The way she describes her lovely Swat Valley gives us only a need to go see it someday. Her detailed description of the harshness of today's world in her own country has left me almost in tears. I pray for Malala that she will stay safe and that she will change Pakistan for the better today and tomorrow. I definitively recommend this book to all who just want to know more about Pakistan, and how they too can change their world for a better one. One domino can make a full stack fall, one brave girl can change her world so that one day, woman will be free, educated and strong. Keep up the great work Malala!

B0036S4B6M|3.0|Orange is the New Black is pretty good, not the  best book I have ever read, but worth reading.  It is interesting and has kept my attention so far. A quick read.  Read the book before you watch the show.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really really like this game but I am not giving it the fifth star because it seems I cannot earn any dollars. Maybe I don't know how to get the bucks, I have been playing it for approximately two weeks. Other than that it is a very nice game. Keeps you entertained for good :o)
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|great absolutely great i  cant stress enough of how great it is even clears up memory, attacks hacks does so much more, great app
B000X2H8G4|4.0|Just wanted to try this out as sometimes we have a bit of a problem hearing TV.  Works well -- sound is clear, legible.  One must be careful how to position the microphone as it does pick up other noises as well BUT if you're aware of that not a problem.
B00DQZQPNM|5.0|Belkin Chambray Cover for All New Kindle Fire HD (will only fit All New KIndle HD).<br />It worked very well, nice fabriic.
B00DM12ANO|4.0|I really wish people would post some of their favorite films alongside of thir reviews. That way we would have some calibration for their opinion. I am frankly stunned by some of the negative reviews on Amazon. This is a solid sci-fi movie that blends romance, fantasy and a great kid-frindly, disstopian premise.<br /><br />Not an easy thing to do in the film genre.<br /><br />Yeah, I could pick it apart for some of its flaws and logic, but the same could be said of any movie that bends the laws of physics.<br /><br />It's a solid premise backed by amazing visual effects. This movie is beautiful to watch and touching to the heart.<br /><br />And just so I practice what I preach here are some of my favorite sci-fi movies: 2001, Gattica, Metropolis, Slaughterhouse 5, Minority Report, Clockwork Orange, and Gravity.
B006QKJQ12|5.0|Reasonably good sequel to the first movie. Kids love it. Cannot be critical about it if the prime intended audience has underscored it.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great show coming from network tv.  At the end of an episode it makes you want to know what happens next.
B008JFUO72|1.0|If you're planning to add this to your itunes library, buy the blue ray version that comes with the digital disc. This version is the digital download and it's NOT transferable to itunes.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Show keeps you in suspense.  Characters story lines are well developed yet still mysterious in their own way,  Great show.
B00C2PO09I|1.0|They do say,  &#34;you get what you pay for,&#34; therefore I should had known at such a low price of an Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray, that always costs a arm and leg for little to nothing, that was my cue to run.  Everything about this movie sucks from the beginning to the end.  This is the kind of movie you can't wait for it to end and what's even worst, there's no one I can give it too.  The only thing I enjoyed was the free shipping and the time it took to receive it.  Please don't make the same mistake.  Rent it first and if I'm found not to have good taste, you will only be out of one buck.  If you already have Netflix you can watch it for free.  Crazy me, it came on Netflix two days after I had receive my copy.
6305428042|5.0|My daughter loves witches! This is such a great Halloween movie. Even I like watching it. Would recommend for kids 3 and up.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The product go in on time. The video really does work u out and makes u bust a sweat!!!! Jillian is a pretty tough trainer but I see results! I defiantly recommend this product to anyone.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Read this the first time in college over 20 years ago. Even better now, understanding adulthood and the connections you make while you grow up!
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I think this movie is worth seeing at least once. It's like a movie where almost all of the budget went into making the movie with almost none left over for marketing (which is actually almost partly true) It may not be a movie everyone enjoys but I don't think anyone would dislike it.<br /><br />Overall it's a great sci-fi/mech movie about human achievement and does that very well. Honestly its in my top 3 favorite movies now.
B00014NE62|5.0|This is the Goldilocks of gay movies- not too saccharine, but not too bitter- it's &#34;just right.&#34; In other words, you need to see this movie to really understand what gay life is all about. You will savor it for years to come.
B00D5O7BPU|3.0|I was hoping to be able to shoot at targets. But as instruction for each weapon it is a good App
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Season 4 is fantastic. There are plenty of unexpected surprises and character developments.  The writing is superb. Such a quality show!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this app I hope to see more from you guys I've learned a lot so much from this app already happy to have  it it's awesome glad to gain coins
0451419243|5.0|I must admit that I almost did not buy this book due to all of the negative replies.<br />But after loving Fall Of Giants I decided to give it a shot and bought the paperback edition a few days ago.<br />All I can say is that after (only) 190 pages this book is a good as Fall of Giants.<br />A very pleasant surprise.
B008GWP2GG|3.0|Not a new science fiction, but enjoyable to watch. I would recommend if you like dialogue but you might get bored.
B000FBJAF0|5.0|Loved reading this, as spellbinding as The Jackal, I really recommend it to any lover of suspense novels that have twists and turns you cant even begin to imagine!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. The singing and acting are great. They also do a good job of not making it corny.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|A must buy! Arrived as expected, packaging outstanding & as for the series itself it's amazing I highly recommend this series to everyone!
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|This is a great story about our American history and the way that it is told has me anxiously waiting to see what's next. I have seasons 1 thru 3 and I am waiting for the fourth season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was very good. Couldn't put the book down. I would recommend this to my friends to read. Loved the story can`t wait to start the next book.
0823015033|5.0|I have never sculpt anything in my life. This book has helped me to create my own doll. I really do love this book, and I highly recommend to buy it. Katherine will guide you step by step, through many pictures to sculpt your own art piece.
B0012PDVQ2|1.0|This movie was entirely generic.  There was not an interesting story line. The suspense was decent. The love scene was horrendous. The only interesting thing about this movie was the duality of the struggle of the main characters. They were conflicted within themselves which made some portions of the evolution of the short interesting
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like the hidden object games.....this one is spooky just in time for Halloween. There are many ways to play. Word scramble, shadow,hang-man regular pictures or by words. Music is pretty good.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|seen s.o.a. the first time a month ago and thought it was cool so I and my wife watched the first 4 years of the show on my kindle had a 6 day marathon of sons of anarchy and enjoyed all 4 years so i'm now a good fan of the show
B00E5Q9VSW|3.0|Recordings of the Brahms Violin Concerto are very common and we've had some major new ones lately.  One of the chief reasons to hear this disc, actually, is that it serves as a sampling of Chailly's Brahms' conducting before he releases a set of the symphonies later this fall.<br /><br />Leonidas Kavakos is a major violinist in his own right, so  I had hopes for this reading.  But the 1st movement turns out to be slow and rather deliberate.  Chailly chooses an aggressive style that digs into the orchestral part rather coldly.  The execution from the Lepzig Gewandhaus is very fine, but I'm not sure why these opening movement needs to be attacked. Instead of being invigorating, it drains it of its feeling of long melodic lines and borders on being flaccid.  As for Kavakos, his playing is refined with nice control but like Chailly, he seems more worried about heroism than effortless musicianship.  I can't say I hear anything extra special.  The same goes for the Adagio, which is reticent and tired-sounding where it could be freewheeling and inspirational.  Two movements of drawn-out grandeur seems a bit much.  Even in the finale the mood remains rigid.  In a movement  that should raise the roof, both Kavakos and Chailly seem more worried about making incisive sounds than letting loose.  In the end, the problem with this reading is that it is too sober, an impression I had on each of my three listens so far.<br /><br />Timing-wise we have generous fillers, but surely they could be more interesting than Bartok's Violin Rhapsodies and a scattering of Brahms' Hungarian Dances, both accompanied by piano.  It doesn't help that Peter Nagy's pianism is tame and completely uninvolving for me.  I still confess I don't hear anything compelling from Kavakos.  I'm guilty of being indifferent to these works in these arrangements, so perhaps there's more interest than I'm hearing.  As it is, I can only fairly report that I wasn't moved by any aspect of the playing.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|To truly appreciate this game you have to wonder, why would I do that? And listen to the theme song. Steady hands are helpful this game is awesome. In a completely random way.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I've been using this app for a couple months at least now, and its very effective and easy to use/understand. I've never had a problem with it at all, and recently I've installed this on my android phone as well.
B000002UTY|5.0|This disc came right on time and I have NEVER had any issue with ordering my favorite from Amazon.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Thanks Amazon for bring me the music I so enjoyed growing up.
6305433909|5.0|My family really enjoy the sister act movies.  We have both of them and we think Whoopi Goldbeg is an excellent actress.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Pretty entertaining and action filled. Actor was a pretty good Dredd even with no Stallone. Hope this is not the future.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|What is there torate on this item?  It works just like it is supposed to and  have not had any problems.  My last cable got broke and I had to replace it.
B00634GHJA|5.0|This is one of the most helpful apps I've ever downloaded.  I used to hate having to connect my phone to my pc to transer photos.  Now I accomplish the same thing just by running the app &amp; selecting the photos on my phone, and going on a website on the pc to download them... done and done!!  Thank you!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A splendid story that helps you appreciate love, life ... and death. Everything else matters less in comparison. Rather than to dwell and suffer, you'll learn to let go and appreciate.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|This App, started off well; installing easily..<br />I was able to find the personal details, of someone who I had lost contact with..So far, so good .<br />However, later on, i discovered that this App interfered with the Web Tab on the Kindle Fire. It dominated totally, like the badly behaved software of years ago..So, I deleted it from my Kindle Fire device .
B003L77FYS|5.0|Enjoy watching without commercials, funny filled with humor. Great suspense. Intelligent. I really love the story lines, the cast and extremely entertaining.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I've been doing research on Jobs and this book really is the best. A lot of books have no access, they're just regurgitating things you could get from a google search. And the story is  fascinating - almost like a novel.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|After reading this book, I honestly feel like the problems I have in life are absolutely not important. I love this book and as Hazel feel in love with Agustus, I fell in love with him too. This book will be reread many times, I love it. It was a real \\"eye opener\\".
B008Y7J91M|4.0|And Hugh Bonneville is hilarious!  Edmund is suitably pensive.  So satisfying when Mary Crawford's true colors are appreciated by all.
B008Y212PI|2.0|The easy level is free and then you have to pay to do any more difficult levels.  I deleted at this point.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|This CD was much more than I expected - it seems like Elvis has pulled in some elements of his older tunes to incorporate into this CD and it works - very well.  His (ok, here is my bias here...) wildly cool, sultry/sexy voice shines through as well as the guitar, sax, and baritone sax shine through.  Never ceases to amaze no matter the artist he pairs with for each session.  LOVE it.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This book goes into the accidents and near misses of having a atomic bomb explode in the U.S.  It points out that even one accident could be extremely serious.  That was something our government seemed to overlook.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|Moonwalker do I need to say more? This is one of his best works that Michael Jackson have done. He made it very hard for everyone else.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Like all the Angry Birds this game is challenging and fun to play.  Also it is addictive!  Be sure you have plenty of time to play.
B00ADR2DTG|2.0|I bought this back in April, and it worked pretty well (note past tense).  It did a fine job amplifying, sounded pretty good -- nice and warm, but not too \\"tubey\\".  It's very susceptible to EMI, so having it near a monitor/laptop causes the slightest bit of background hum and \\"chitter\\".  Everything was roses until today, 6 months later.  A loud \\"pop\\" followed by a loud hum, and that's it.  No more amplifier.  It's dead and gone.<br /><br />I suppose it was worth the money, but in the long run you're probably better off getting something that costs a bit more that will most likely live for a lot longer.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I love this book really turned the light on for us and helped us heal after tough times. I wanted to share it with everyone after it was shared with me .it templates the importance of a healthy relationship because they take work and if mire people could communicate more couples would stay together happily and find joy in their partnership again. Please make the time to read this book you will be grateful you did.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I have had this game on my kindle for about 6 months with no problems,I have enjoyed playing world at arms,one of the better game I have down loaded. Then one day it stops loading and haven't been able to play it since.It's a 5 star game up until it wouldn't load.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My 4 year old great niece loves it. It's a musical with lots of dancing. It has a great story line too!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book gave a sense of closure for Daniel Torrence as well as introducing a completely new type of antagonist, The True Knot. Loved it!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Books for kindle<br />John Schramm  this kindle book is very helpful. i explaining how to go about preparing a book for kindle.<br />Book publishing for kindle
1446249182|5.0|Great book! Very helpful and actually funny (as funny as stats can be...) I wish this was used at our course book instead of the dry crusty book my instructor chose.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love playing it so many diff characters and boards<br />And you go to diff places it is really fun you even can<br />Log on to Facebook and play against friends so cool
B009RH9HDS|3.0|My kindle pops out too easily and the swivel is too tough to move.  The leather is nice quality and color.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This is an amazing movie, great soundtrack if you like sci fi watch this movie. Watch in HD because the visual effect are visually stunning.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I enjoyed the unexpected twists and turns. Very we'll written! I like the way it all came together and the surprising ending! I can always predict the ending but not in this book! Great job Liane Moriarty I will keep my eyes open for your next book!
0312933541|5.0|For instance I tried this author because I have red another two and both had met my expectations. Love it!
B005HSG3U6|3.0|This is a good product for the price. I like the style and fit. However the material and color shows all the dirt and it doesn't clean off.
B000XVK30S|5.0|What a fun movie to watch! Love watching it again! I have watched this movie 5 times over the years and it still just as entertaining!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout has written a fantastic book which reflects her experience of thought as energy and how we can alter the trajectory of our life by understanding the concept and learning to focus our own mind to achieve our own personal desires.  The nine different simple experiments to show the power of the mind were simple, fun and fantastic.  I recommend this book to every person who has any degree of desire to elevate their life's quality.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|gets to the point. quick and easy to use but the ad is annoying but a small price for a free app
B00DSAYADC|5.0|I love this illustrated book of Little Women.  The story, of course, is fabulous.  The illustrations bring it to life.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Great story line but could not help thinking, &#34;catch him already&#34;. Season two was much more dramatic. Though in restrospect it had to be set up with season one. Don't know where season three can go will be interested to see if the writers and or tempermant of the show changes. Looking forward to th story line.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Very compelling show.  Visuals were fantastic at the end.  What else can happen in this small town?  Will be interesting to find out.  David Tennant is believable in his role, glad he didn't die!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I love mad men.  I was bored with the first 4 episodes, but then I was hooked.  Yes, placing it in the 1960s is a gimick, but an effective one.<br /><br />The first few episodes are meant to shock you: &#34;Wow! Did men really drink and smoke all day at work?&#34; &#34;Wow! Did men really talk to women that way?&#34; That quickly wears off and it becomes a really good show.  I would have never started watching them, though, if I had to wait a week between episodes.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|maybe I'm just not crazy about games that require you to return daily in order to make progress. The premise of the game isn't bad, but I'd rather play through on my own time rather than be forced to return on consecutive days.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|This series is just as boring as you think it would be...you are just watching a series of therapy sessions.  Yet somehow, maybe because all the episodes are very short, you get sucked into them.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|It is unusual, compelling, beautifully written.  A must for anyone who wants to read a quality book.<br />I'm sorry I've finished it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of the best bingo games.I only wish it would not be so hard to win some of the gems.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This is a wonderful game for all ages with some real quick action. It makes you think fast and spontaneous. Go for it!!!
B004EF65QA|5.0|I have always loved historical fiction.  After watching the North and South series, I began reading Elizabeth Gaskell's novel named the same.  What I have found are the parallels between the two---series and book.  The characters/actors are well aligned.  Loved it!  Despite the detail the novel gives, the series replicates in &#34;film-adequate&#34; viewing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game kept me guessing and hooked from the first chapter. Purchased for my 11 year old daughter (who also loved it!) and decided to read it myself.
B00632HWOG|5.0|The prefect way to integrate my Yahoo Mail with my Kindle Fire. I actually prefer the Kindle Fire app over the pc version. This app is pure gold. :)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Many twists and turns on this book. Just when you think that you have it figured out, he throws another curve.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Moving story about two women and how they manage to navigate difficulties of living in a war-torn country where women have few opportunities and choices.  The women form a powerful bond of friendship in the midst of living with abuse and the hazards of war.  The book explores the limits on their own agency to make choices to shape their life circumstances.  It's a gripping story well worth the read.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Enjoyed this movie immensely.  One of the best bond movies ever.<br /><br />Much darker than any of the previous 007 movies.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this book. I highly recommend it. Through the stories of all the characters Hosseini builds a story everyone can relate to.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I really liked the movie and couldn't stop laughing.  Could watch over and over again.  Glad I purchased it.  Love It.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I bought this album because my 4 year-old loves \\"Home.\\" But, I've been pleasantly surprised by the awesome sound. Most of the other songs remind me of Dave Matthews in a good way. Bonus that he wrote a majority of the songs. I will look forward to future albums from Phillips.
B004S49YEM|5.0|An engaging spy yarn of the old style - no James Bond gadgets - with a clever well paced plot, three dimensional characters and enough historical fact inserted into the plot to leave you wanting to know more about this period of history.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This story puts your faith back in mankind. I would recommend this to one and all. My prayers to all our service men & women around the world.
B00CEQ1JOO|1.0|beautiful doll, but.....<br />has excess of glue on the hair, which has ruined all the hair aesthetically, looks like a sticky mess
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Action, suspense, twists, turns, and Christopher Nolan's incredible writing and directing. What more could you ask for? This is one of my favorite movies.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I had a blast with this game and if you enjoy puzzles of logic, you will too.  So happy to have snagged this one, and I'm looking forward to more from this company.
B001XVCX96|4.0|I didn't think I'd like this movie but I really ended up enjoying it. It didn't end the way I wanted it to, but the mark of a good movie is not delivering the ending people may want, while still garnering so many positive reviews. Well done movie.
B00EMJD6TC|3.0|What's the deal with zombies? Well, at least these zombies didn't move like the original Mummy; these boys and girls were world-class sprinters. Kinda made the film more interesting, if you get my mindless drivel....
6305558167|5.0|Based on the novel La Mort d'Arthur, which is a fictional account of what happens when mortals mess with magic to obtain power. The author, Malory, plays it fast and loose and stays focused on the myth rather than the history of of Arthur. As a movie it is exciting and awe-inspiring with cinematography that clues the viewer's attention to the screen. The actors are barely holding as they are swept up in a panorama of action, the double-cross, adultery, incest, fratricide, matricide, and murder, with the males spending the entire film sandwiched into full-body, metal armor, while the women wear costumes that are totally captivating and original. The battle scene alone are worth the price of admission as well as the tree of round table knights lynched from an ancient tree, their skeletal appearance creating an atmosphere of complete dread. I cannot recommend this film enough. It is a full evening of extraordinary cinema and a hell of a good time.
B0061US58C|3.0|If you were looking for a good ride like the trip you took watching the first CARS, don't rely on this animation to give you an 'all-wheel-ride' experience, because it won't...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game I love it. its like taking care of your own horse. the only thing I don't like is it takes a while to compete.
B004F1F32A|4.0|Better than I expected, especially for a story that has been told dozens of times...SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER -- if I counted correctly (just a little nonsense I do when I watch 'shoot-'em-up' movies), Liam Neeson dispatched over 24 bad guys. If the story wasn't so good, it might have become a laugher...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4! I love the characters and clothes. Grandmama is sooo funny. I love her snide comments!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I like the game but I have been having problems with it not loading. I have lost my progress twice had to start all over. I am reluctant to start again in case this happens again. Which is a shame because I was really enjoying playing it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|My husband and I both love it.  It has good character development.  It is shows some realistic moral vs legal issues.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|The end of this book was a real letdown, the solution came out of left field and was a real bust.  It' s as if she got tired of plotting and just wanted it to end.  Have always liked her books but can't recommend this one.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|All your favorites are back  and JJ does it again.  Cool story, great characters and Benedict Cumberbatch gives another great performance.
159463176X|5.0|I reallylikedthe way it described personalities by story or incidents.<br />Some of the characters  seemed familiar from &#34;the Kite Runner&#34;
B003U53GK8|3.0|It feels like the last season was rushed. It truly can't compare to seasons before. Left a viewer wanting more and disappointed.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita was able to clarify many things for me. I knew the concept of some things but Anita changed that to a much better understanding if not to complete clarity. I also learnt many many new things!<br /><br />Thank You Anita!
B001O3B2M2|4.0|very good amazon is the best place to find the things you need thanks amazon for being there its pretty hard to find stuff as it is.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|In anticipation of this book I reread The Shining. It was my favorite of Stephan Kings books.<br />Dr. sleep is a book I couldn't put down. References to The Shining are cleverly woven into it's fabric. To fully appreciate it, I suggest you reread The Shining<br />Neither book will disappoint you. Enjoy
B003VURG62|5.0|A pop classic album. I see myself listening to this for decades to come. It's a fun, Summery record. Standout tracks are &#34;Who Am I Living For?&#34; &#34;E.T.&#34; and the title track, &#34;Teenage Dream.&#34;
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I watched this movie right after I watched &#34;Dawn of the dead&#34;...I enjoyed this movie and then I needed a laugh so Shaun of the dead followed and it was great. I love those 2 actors ;-)
B00BBXTSB2|5.0|I love this movie. I learned a lot from her life: how she struggled getting a record out and proved people who didn't believe in her wrong. She's really genuine and funny. I'm a big fan! The special features are great, too: full length performances of &#34;Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)&#34; and &#34;Waking Up in Vegas&#34; and a bunch of other adorable clips. Worth buying and highly recommended!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|One of the best movies ever. A must see for all those couples who truly love each other. What a beautiful story!
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I really love this record! I still listen to it in 2013. Standout tracks are &#34;Hot n Cold,&#34; &#34;Fingerprints&#34; and &#34;Waking Up in Vegas.&#34;
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I understand that this is merely part if the story focusing on specific characters, but even in the midst of a series, this did not feel like a complete book. Sure, it furthered the plot well enough, but it significantly lacked the jaw-dropping moments we got in each of the previous 3 books. Even each POV endings in the book seemed anti-climactic (with the exception of the closing moments of Brienne's final chapter which were arguably the most dramatic of the entire book). I'm looking forward to ADWD next, but I fear that it too will prove anti-climactic. This book gave me the sneaking suspicion that these are simply building to the real action and reveals in books 6 and 7. I hope I'm wrong.
1936608898|5.0|Great book with lots of information. Written so anyone can understand it. I would recommend that anyone young or old read this and consider the information in it.<br /><br />I had an autoimmune attack my optic nerve. Which I had read this book years ago-I might not have lost my eyesight.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|Interesting to read how other Whedonites feel about this film. I had the pleasure of meeting Joss Whedon at the premiere of this film at the Seattle Independent Film Festival and chewed him out for being so talented. Writing, composing music, and then deciding to film an entire movie in his house in ten days, mostly editing it on his computer. I find the results stunning. The black and white photography is accented by the use of angles on glass - windows, wine bottles, jars. The comedy is muted and you have to look for it. Nathan Fillian locking the keys in the car ... the big tough soldiers getting ready to bunk in the little girl bedroom of Joss' daughter. A good homage to Shakespeare and I would not have picked those leads, but after seeing it - perfect for this setting. Don't work so hard - enjoy Shakespeare.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie is one I will watch again and again. Full of great actors, a story that just keeps you wanting more and an ending that will stun you. If you love magic and mystery, you will love this movie.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Purchased on a whim when it was free and love it. Fun game with various options to play.  Highly recommend.
0307949486|3.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a wonderful mystery book. It creates suspense and gets your nerves on end. IT also has all of the qualities of a good mystery book. Steig Larsson creatively sets up the book in two parts and then has them merge into one. The book starts off with Carl Mikael Blomkvist who has just been convicted of slandering a famous financier and has to pay a fine and do three months in jail. He then tries to stay out of the spotlight and lay low for a while but then he receives a call. Next thing you know he is knee deep in an investigation and not so out of the spotlight has he had hoped for. the second main character is Lisbeth Slander.  Lisbeth sees more than her word processor page in black and white and despises the users and abusers of this world. She won't hesitate to get her revenge on bullies,predators, and corrupt magnates. These two have great character growth and develop into very interesting characters. I cant wait to read the next book in this trilogy.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I used to use this product until they went haywire regarding who owned my data. So I stopped using it. I am in a highly confidential field and did not want to share. No hard feelings. Then, a year later, they charged me $47 for another annual fee because they had some way when I purchased the biz plan via paypal to select that they could bill me every year!! Since I would never agree to this, didn't expect it at all until I saw it on my paypal account. What a scam! Not only can't I use my old data but I paid for a company with whom I no longer want to do business.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|It is everything that I thought it would be.  I like Blake as an artist and was not disappointed at all,
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I use the USB adapter to connect an audio interface to my iPad3/iOS7.  Works as expected.  I have not used the card reader.
B000I62JAK|5.0|Ben Stiller at his best.  Would hope they make a sequel in the near future.  The movie is &#34;really, really good looking!&#34;
B0053TMP24|5.0|My grandchildren turned me on to Percy Jackson.  I love both series so far.  The Son of Neptune was especially fantastic because Percy met the Roman demigods.  A real page turner.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|great intro to the 4th season. We signed up for the TV pass and were able to watch it in the AM.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5 because the ads are a pain in the butt. Also, a redeal button would be nice.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Throughout this shows run, the writing, direction and acting has been first-rate and season 5 is, so far, on par, with great story-lines, excellent casting and reasoned, thoughtful and logical progression of the plots.
B00005JKZV|5.0|the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The wife hadn't seen the second or third installment. I must have purchased the Two Towers a handful of times; losing each copy as I move. Can't go wrong.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Boring game... blowing for airplane does not work on kindle fire... but its all about the video...really that's it it makes it worth the game play to get there.  Good for kids.. little graphic so maybe older kids
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The final for Season 3 was disappointing. I thought it would end on a happy note.<br />Maggie Smith carries this series.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Amazing. Must read. It's effortless to become attached to the characters. The setting is rich and engaging. The author writes well, and makes his own rules.
1932100660|5.0|First, this book was so well-written, clear, concise and organized that it was a pleasure to read. Next, the author was so humble and not self-promoting that I found him very trustworthy. At no time did I feel he was touting a cause. Rather, I felt he was transparently presenting facts and reasons for coming to the conclusions he came to. He appeared to me to be doing his job as a scientist, i.e. a truth-seeker.<br /><br />The author appears to me to be someone who sees facts and logical conclusions and presents them without worry about offending the powers that be. This type of person is often a hero and often ends up being vindicated in the end. Most people, no matter how educated, do not like to challenge nor change their worldview and behavior and end up ignoring facts that are glaringly apparent. It's amazing to see individuals and populations exist this way...it's out fatal, human flaw. But Dr. Campbell is one of those rare people who sees facts and uses logic to draw conclusion.<br /><br />Personally, this book made me think and rethink my choices of food for myself and family. I eat fish, eggs and dairy, with an emphasis on dairy. Because of this book, I'm going to lay off my emphasis on these proteins, if for no other reason than I can't stand the whole factory-farming, big-lobby machine. I'm rethinking going so quickly to medications as the answer, because I completely agree with his assessment of our lack of holistic analysis as a culture. I'm going to try to eat more veggies and fruit, a weakness of mine.<br /><br />In short, this book impacted my thinking and behavior (I hope) more than anything has in a long time...not because the author was at all pushy, but because he was extremely honest. Thank you, Dr. Campbell, for telling us the truth as you discovered it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved reading this book! It was emotional without being sappy. I empathized with all the characters and really wanted to know how their lives were going to turn out. Excellent plot and wonderful ending that kept you guessing all the way to the very last page! Definitely a must read!!
0618154248|5.0|These stories are classic and it's wonderful to have them in board book form for the little ones who might tear regular pages.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The secret is stunning but not as the act itself but for the linking of actions and consequences. Hearts say one thing and minds tug in another. I really liked learning about Australian middle class life too. Nobody is perfect. Living with flaws and still enjoying life is easier said than done.<br />Davidandersonpe
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a real fun game with a few challenges, normally you would have to pay for a game like this.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Just for complete the 50 years full book in blue ray version. One of the best 007 movies of the series
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is so fun you should get this I  play this every day you should play this every day and you save the people from getting hurt
B007EC27QM|5.0|Simple. Took only a minute or two to figure its logic. As I said, perfect for me. Three more words.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|I have this headphone for a little more than two years and even though I've been taking care of it, the right channel is gone. I wished that this was more durable, but I guess it was made like that. That's why I gave three stars.
0553385445|4.0|Having read &#34;Wolf of Wall Street&#34;, I had to read this as well.  Incredible true story that reads like crazy fiction.  I had to verify on the web that this was really true.  Among this man's numerous talents, he can write as well.  I would have given it five stars if I wasn't turned off by the fact that what this guy and many others like him did ended up hurting the country's economy so badly.  Brilliant book by a Wall Street weasel.
B00C5R8364|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Jack Reacher and Mitch Rapp series!  This read more like those.  Great action and characters you want to root for.  I am looking forward to checking out his other books.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just began this game but so far so good. Love the graphics and the story line looks very interesting. I know I will enjoy this game.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Entartaining! Good actors, nice story.  I am not sure how real an feasible are the high tone dialogues at court, but it makes one feel interested at the story
B00FEN1C50|4.0|I was expecting more of carbon copy of mecha type stuff from japan but it was not.  It was a good movie but not much storyline except for a few characters.  The final battle was pretty good but there was not as much fighting overall that I would have expected from a mecha movie.  This is more of a Humans vs Aliens scifi movie than anything else.  There are some amusing parts and the acting was not horrible.  I feel like they didn't really get enough screen time per character to really show their skill.  However I can't say the acting was bad or that a lack of screen time was bad.  It was a different kind of movie.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars is perfect,songs are very well done great sound wished it was longer i listen to it over and over in my car
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Sure it's corny and the acting is so-so but the visuals and sounds are so ridiculously good that it's practically impossible to not get immersed in the action. I grew up with original Power Rangers so any movie that pits giant robots against giant monsters is a must-watch in my book.<br /><br />Also, it has Charlie Day and he's awesome in this.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great set! The quality of the picture is amazing! I watch these movies over and over again!  A must have for collectors!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Sad, but funny and brave. The three main kids in this story are so likeable and so accepting and wise.
157421327X|3.0|Not quite the detail I was looking for, found a book at Barnes and Noble that was much more in depth.  Price and shipping for this book were what balanced out the disappointment.
B00CFA227C|5.0|I know that this movie has gotten alot of bad press, but honestly, I thought it was awesome! The special effects were extraordinary, I loved the cast, and the giants, WOW!! The way I see it, it's a fairy tale, plain and simple, and it has been done for the big screen in perfection. I honestly can't say anything bad about this movie, and I don't think you will either. Give it a chance, you just might be pleasantly surprised.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that anyone can enjoy. I loved the way actual news reels were interwoven into the story.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Well, I have to say that I had never been a fan of zombie movies, but this series definitely changed my mind. I watched the entire first season in one weekend, and I don't think I'll do that again. Not because of the gore, and it is seriously there, but I never imagined how attached I would grow to the cast, and seeing some of my favorite characters get torn apart by these blood-thirsty monsters, just tore my heart out (pun intended). I've never seen a horror series that grabbed me so hard and kept me in fear and tears, episode after episode. I've been a faithful fan ever since. Now, even though I watch it on TV religiously, I have bought all three seasons so far, and will keep on buying them. This is a rare series, and one that I will watch over and over again. If you are a fan of zombies, buy this series, if you are a fan of blood and guts, buy this series, if you are a fan of great acting, buy this series. What I'm trying to tell you is, &#34;BUY THIS SERIES&#34;!! You won't regret it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am very much enjoying watching Season 3 again in great anticipation of Season 4.<br />I highly recommend it to everyone.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I fell in love with Supernatural from the very first season, and it has kept me hanging on for eight years, and now starting the ninth. Awesome story lines, suspenseful and sometimes down right scary, this series is one that keeps you wanting more. I hope the Winchester boys keep going for more, because it will be a sad day when Sam & Dean hang up their weapons.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I was looking for a HA HA funny book when I selected this.  Although it is not a HA HA funny book, it does have light moments and is pleasantly entertaining, educational and very interesting.  A pleasant surprise.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have this on my home computer and am addicted to the game. It's a real challenge and never gets boring. So happy to have it on my portable Kindle.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Everyone in this movie was outstanding.  I've watched it several times and continue to thorough enjoy it.  Another side of our most famous president and very well done indeed.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Sorry Bing, but Google is my favorite search site. Bing gives me too much information about variety of vaguely related subjects.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Was not able watch it while it was on got caught up love it good job keep up the work holy cow zombies
B0056Q7VVE|2.0|The book had crayon marks and the cover were torn in the corners. No other problem were there.  Thank you.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Liked it! Action packed from beginning to end. Folks just need to remember it's entertainment, pick up some popcorn, soda, and milk duds and enjoy!
B00CHVIPP2|1.0|DVD worked but Blu-Ray won't load the movie. Want to replace the Blu-Ray only but Amazon does not offer that. Sent the DVD and toy to grandson in Texas and he is happy with that. This is the second item I have ordered from Amazon that I can do nothing about. I'll stop ordering on Amazon.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is good because you can shoot deer and it is really good for kids so I suggest you get it.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|dont waste your money. it is all airy fairy with no real insights or practical application. rather read stepehn coveys 7 habits
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|i thought it was pretty good.  not as raunchy and funny as the first twi, but it had its moments.  the clip after the credits was hilarious.
0399255370|5.0|i love this book, my granddaughter also loved it.  she will be very happy when she can read it on her own.. we both enjoyed it and shared laughes together.
0952835827|5.0|Whoever uses the series Practical / Advanced / High-Level Everyday English has the one and only choice: either to learn or to learn.  Apart from the clear explanations and examples of every one of the words or phrases, as well as the dialogs and the exercises, there is a lot of repetition: when learning a new word or phrase, another one that has already been learned is recalled. Needless to say, this only helps students memorize what they have been studying; it could hardly be more effective! Although the book is intended to be used by British ESL students, given that the vast majority of the words and phrases are used by either British or American English speakers, someone learning American English will find this book very useful too. In other words, this series is virtually a must for whomever wants to speak English fluently.  Ernesto Simon, ESL Teacher
B00FN811SY|5.0|I would recommend this bible to everyone!  It is very easy to read and understand.  There are references that help tremendously with understanding the scriptures.
B0041D843M|4.0|China Study has helped me to understand the basics of nutrition without any complication. And I am sure everybody and enjoyable life eating good food for life
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Literally show stopping. I couldn't put it down I would have to keep restarting my shows because I would have to keep playing. I love it!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I ordered this for my kid. After watching it, he convinced me to take him to the store and we bought a whole bunch of weights. He is actually working out regularly. Me, I feel motivated too, but, I just day-dream about it, instead of lifting for real.<br /><br />I tell you, it was good seeing Arnold in his prime, and at the very beginning of his movie career. I generally have a thing about movie bonus features, that I never watch them because they spoil the make-belief world of the movie, but this one seems to be an exception. I watched the bonus features and enjoyed them.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|it was no suprise this movie didnt do welll in the theatre. It was boring and lacked imagination. Sorry Will.
B00081U6EG|5.0|I play a Strat (a 50th Anniversary, Maple Neck, Made-In-The-USA, Double Tobacco Sunburst beauty; all stock).  Playing guitar for almost 50 years gives me an edge over most people who can only dream of tasting some gigs I've done in my long musical life.  Hence, when I saw STRAT-Pack on my Netflix lineup, I was naturally intrigued.  I turned it on, and all I could say was that I immediately enjoyed myself!  You gotta start a show somewhere, and the surviving members of the Crickets was a novel idea--even with Brian May playing guitar for them, and Ronny Wood also showing up for a tune.  You go through Hank Marvin (EXCELLENT &#34;Sleepwalk,&#34; Hank!), and then a song by this Anderson gal, whom I honestly had never heard of before, and then things start getting heated up.  She was relegated to fiddling while backing the great Albert Lee up on what can only be described as a BLISTERING &#34;Country Boy.&#34;  I'm a Rocker and a Bluesman, therefore other genres like Country rarely figures into my repertoire; BUT, I can APPRECIATE what it took for Albert to actually pull this extraordinary contribution of his.<br />Then you bring out Paul Carrack who does a wonderful set of 4 songs we are all familiar with (well, 3 for me): &#34;How Long,&#34; All Along the Watchtower,&#34; and &#34;While My Guitar Gently Weeps.&#34;  You're reeling from the great performances so far, and then they bust Gary Moore out, and his &#34;Red House&#34; is completely ON FIRE!  Then you go through a few more rather mediocre contributions (MY opinion only, Good People), and then you get to David Gilmour playing the Strat acquisition of his serial numbered &#34;0001&#34;; a segue into a grand finale of the Faces tune &#34;Stay With Me.&#34;<br />Yes, there were a few lame moments, but what would we have done if there weren't different gauges we could use to evaluate the performances of some of the most legendary Strato-meisters EVER?  We'd be lost.  This leads me to ask where Eric was?  You can surely bet if Stevie Ray was still with us, HE'D a made an appearance?  Robert Cray?  So many.<br />If you're patient and take music for what it delivers HOW it is delivered, you will certainly enjoy this PARTY I wish I were at.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I use it a lot.  The large buttons make it very User friendly too.  Has just what I need without being too much.
B004WMKSH2|3.0|As an adult, I am not a big Harry Potter Fan, but I found this episode to be quite entertaining. Viewers should be able to follow it whether you have watched the previous Harry Potter movies or not. It was enjoyable and entertaining looking forward to seeing Part II.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A fitting sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;. Like all good King novels, it was a great ride.  I even read a good part of it in the car on my iphone...risking car sickness and a headache to finish before arriving back at the farm.
B005UG542S|4.0|If you enjoyed part 1 as I did you will not be disappointed with part 2. Very good sequel, great action, again if you missed the previous harry potters as I did you are still able to follow and enjoy the movie. Definitely worth watching.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I just finished Doctor Sleep....it was a good book but.......there was something lacking in it......maybe there should have been more on Rose and her clan. Overall a good read with a good ending.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I am a big comic book fan since my teens years. Was looking forward to Iron mans old enemy The Mandarin. But the Mandarin as comic book fans know him never appears. The movie would have been better if the writers/producers had left the &#34;fake&#34; mandarin out.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|So funny and entertaining from start to finish! She's a great author, and I hope she writes a few more books.
B008N1LL42|4.0|OK, this is science &#34;fiction&#34; pure enjoyment and entertainment pull out the chips popcorn what ever you enjoy sit back DON'T OVER THINK IT... this is not Shakespeare... just enjoy the fun.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love Kurt Sutter’s hard-hitting and complex drama.  So many characters to fear and dislike in this.  It’s perfect catharsis! I’m hooked!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This film is a work of art. Being yourself in a world that forces you to convention is a life worth living. It is a film that dares to push our views on what live should be and dares us to create a life of love.  Experience your life and experience this film that dazzles the soul.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Very easy to use. Can put it on kindle and Android tablets as well as my cell phone. Can print anywhere in house or away.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love it.. can't get enough! I have fallen in love with some of the characters and especially love Kalinda. She is my favorite.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm going to miss that sweet southern belle. This was an exciting and unexpected ending to a great series. It was not a disappointment nor did Mrs. Harris take the easy road. My heart is warm.
1846573793|5.0|Love the book! Only had it a little more than a week and almost done reading it! Love the reader!
0896898288|4.0|I heard about this book from other quilters. I was curious, and was pleased that the blocks were smaller sizes. I plan to use Thirties fabrics to make it.  I had to get my son to load the disc in my computer. That was the only frustration. I would have paid more to have the templates either included, or paid separately for a paper set of patterns. I think that would be a great idea to offer a set of paper templates. I know a lot of quilters would appreciate having a set on hand. Otherwise, am looking forward to my newest project.
B0041KVZ1I|4.0|For many years the album was hard to get , now finally the album has been rereleased on Vinyl at 180gr pressing. Abbey Road is the 11th studio album released by the English rock band the Beatles. It is their last recorded album, although Let It Be was the last album released before the band's dissolution in 1970. Work on Abbey Road began in April 1969, and the album was released on 26 September 1969 in the United Kingdom, and 1 October 1969 in the United States.<br />To have this album in my collection is a treasure and I'm so glad it has such good sound and comes in such good quality. Everyone should have this album in there collection even if you just buy one vinyl get it.
B00F35BV64|2.0|The original wrath of Khan had an engaging villain spouting words from Herman Melville.  This one was cold, uninteresting.  Even the special effects got annoying.  Disappointing and frankly boring.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|If it weren't for the ending, I would have given this movie 5 stars. I can't believe all the positive comments about such a conclusion! Without trying to add a a SPOILER I'll just say No WAY would 4 people agree on that ending after a mere couple days, maybe not EVER. But...it had a good cast, created suspense, was unique and basically contained all the elements I like in a thriller/monster movie sort of movie. Love Stephen King. But... honesty, the ending was just terrible.
B006TTC5QS|5.0|Great movie! Arrived in excellent condition! Wonderful to have all 3 versions in one...not all of our DVD players are blue-ray, and I love having the digital copy on my computer & iPod.
B00E0SX118|5.0|What a fun movie. I will enjoy watching this with my grandson for years to come.Wonderful  movie for the whole family.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This movie arrived in perfect condition. It's great to have all 3 options for viewing, since not all of our DVD players are blue-ray.
0307719227|4.0|I enjoy reading this book, and the deep analysis of how the political structure impacts on the economic growth in a nation is fascinating and thought provoking.
B002ZBPZNY|5.0|needed to update my music catalog for my MPS player and can't do without this one.  Highly recommend this to anyone who likes this genre.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So good. Everything is so well written. You never want to put it down, it's so amazing. Read this book. Read all of them!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device easy to set up and easy to use. My only drawback is use of an app on a phone for things like Netflix. Once one's phone goes to the lock screen after starting a movie or during viewing, he or she has to go all the way back in to the app just to pause the movie. For this reason I sometimes find it's just easier to use an app built in the TV, because it's faster to just grab the remote and press pause. Not a deal breaker for me though. I just hope in the future more apps support the use of this device like Amazon Prime. It's also great for streaming youtube videos to my TV. That's where it gets the most use from me.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can't comment on Google Play or Chrome tab integration, as I don't really have a use for that, but I figured $35 for a nice little Netflix and Youtube streamer would be worth it, and I was very pleased with the results. I have a first generation Roku XD and its navigation is painfully slow, Netflix constantly drops quality for no reason, and I can't stream Youtube on it.<br /><br />For starters, my setup is probably different than most (the INTENDED setup). I actually plug this little guy into the back of my receiver on one of the inputs (previously used by my Roku), and for this purpose, I did actually require the HDMI extender included in the box, which I didn't expect to need. It was very comforting that Google included ALL of the required and possible use cables and adapters in the box. For $35, that's really something, if you ask me.<br /><br />Setup was so easy, I'm fairly certain an 8 year old could handle it. It took about 3 minutes, then another 10 or 15 to wait for updates, and my Chromecast was ready to go. So far, I've used it quite a few times. Youtube is great. It usually starts in SD and goes up to HD in the first 10 seconds of the video. I'd prefer it to default to HD, and would rather wait for that to buffer, but I'm really just looking for a complaint here. It streams very nicely and the integration with my phone and tablet is seamless. Netflix always plays HD when available. I have not yet seen a Netflix video drop down to SD as it does frequently on my Roku. Considering the Roku is hooked up via LAN, I'm wondering if this is impressive for the Chromecast wi-fi radio, or just plain sad for the Roku. Either way, I'm pleased with the Chromecast.<br /><br />It does the things I expected out of it, and probably better than I thought it would. For the price, I don't see a reason to not get one of these unless you have a smart TV that already does what this device does.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The movie gets your attention from start to end. I thought I had it figured out several times only to be wrong. I had to pause it for a few hours couldn't wait to get back and finish it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I played this game for about a day and after that I got loads of money but not enough investor points to move forward in the game.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Loved the details, twists, turns and emotional connections made.  Explicit details of white decor in rooms was fun to read too.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|This game is really great and it does kill time and it is very addicting.it gets me hooked every time I play it.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|My son loves this toy he can play with it for hours. Very colorful and it made for a happy baby and happy momma

B0067R0APK|5.0|I enjoy the time they put into creating this app. Not only do I know my local weather, I also see what's going on back in Oklahoma. Of course they aren't right all the time, but 95% of the time is great. Many options to choose from. All around the best weather app out there.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|This app is awesome. If you are think this is a game as good as the Xbox, you got another thing coming. This app is only a good game to pass the time. If you can buy the Xbox version. Console games never disappoint.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is very addictive. Although there are  long wait periods the graphics are very good and there is always new things top do.
B000SXMNI6|5.0|What's to say. It's Jethro Tull! They don't write 'em like that any more. Classic rock & roll will always be here after rap crap is long forgotten!
B005LLXBYA|5.0|This is definitively a different album. Not the typical compilation of well-known a not so well-known disco hits. There are many one-off disco singers in the collection. Considering all songs that are included, this album is rarer than the Super Rare Disco Series. Most songs are nice even though you are not necessarily hearing the original mixes because of the edits and re-re-edits.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I  read both  Dark Places and Gone Girl this week. I have missed sleep as I couldn't put them down!!
B002JCSWVG|5.0|An essential film to understand how present-day South Africa came about in the mid-1990s. it is recommended to anyone trying to see the difference between Mandela's approach and that of other leaders in the region, who chose confrontation over cooperation after kicking out white minority rulers.<br /><br />Mandela gives us all a great lesson in humanity as well as shrewd politics. This film has the great merit of reminding the world of an episode that would have otherwise been forgotten.
B009P1WES6|4.0|'Alex' is a remarkable, breathless thriller that's surprisingly unpredictable. You're captivated by the story as if you were the kidnap victim; you can't escape being drawn to the well-crafted characters and plot turns.<br /><br />In the beginning, what looks to be a kidnap-ransom caper, soon becomes something completely different and totally unexpected.<br /><br />An unlikely commandant, or detective, Camille Verhoeven, is drawn out of self-imposed exile after losing his wife, and into a case not unlike the one that nearly destroyed him. He not only has to unravel the mystery of the kidnapped victim, but also overcome his past failings. In the midst of this drama, we learn about his complicated relationship with his late mother.<br /><br />The kidnap victim, Alex Pr&eacute;vost, is, like Camille, dealing with an unpleasant past, at the same time trying to stay ahead of her tormentors who not only include the kidnapper, but also menacing, tactical rats, threatening her while curled up in a cage suspended from a ceiling by ropes.<br /><br />But Alex is not just a kidnap victim. She's more than that, and commandant Camille's job is to find her to untangle a web she's weaved. The detectives job is made a little harder by an ambitious, arrogant investigating magistrate.<br /><br />'Alex' is the first novel by French author, Pierre Lemaitre, that's been translated into English, and considered one of the best crime novels of the year, and for good reason.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This visually beautiful series is very well-crafted.  It's smart without being too snappy and deftly combines the sinister side of politics and the law with the soft, vulnerable facets of it's characters.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell's is always good, but even for him this is exceptional. It is all important, but chapter three on education should wake up parents to the massive changes a capable teacher can make in a student and collectively, in a society. We cannot continue to accept teaching incompetence nor fail to appropriately reward the skilled who can reform a country. It costs about the same to keep a person in a California prison as at Stanford. Most prisoners are school and parenting failures. How much can we afford to invest to prevent this? This not meant to underestimate the hope given to parents on students with learning problems.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|This jumperoo has really made my grandson happy.  He loves to jump and he loves all the little toys and gadgets on it.  He has choices, jump or play, and he laughs the whole time.  We put him in it for short periods of time during the day, and I love the expression on his face when we do.

B00BMR4RIG|3.0|Not bad for a basic weather app. So far has been working well but could use a bit more in the forcast area
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Our tradition is to watch documentaries about music and the music industry.  I've seen many and enjoyed them all...and I'm just your regular person that enjoys music.  By far this is my favorite.  Brings back lots of memories...as great music always does. I didn't realize this small town, the Swampers and Rick Hall had such a massive impact on music.  This movie was so educational (I just learned what \\"muscle shoals has got the swampers\\" meant in the hit Sweet Home Alabama...and I've been listening to Lynryd Skynryd for YEARS).  So touching...I didn't want the movie to end.  And a little sad...I can't think of anything like this today--session musicians...the magically creative musical process...the diversity.  I can't wait until this comes out on video to own. I just ordered the various soundtracks.  Visiting the Tennessee river is now on my bucket list.
B0068LYEHA|1.0|The question must have been misunderstood. TinaFey's book was witty and fantastic. This book went too far to get you to laugh. Her points got lost in bathroom humor.
B009ZQJVAK|4.0|Before the broadway show Kinky Boots.  The movie is fun and entertaining.  The accents are slightly difficult to understand but all in all a good movie.
0061438294|5.0|The publisher obviously made the author include some lame over the top statements in the intro section. Ignore the standard self help BS in front, the rest of this book is amazingly well written. The author considers both sides of many topics, and is careful to remind readers that there are no absolutes in human behavior!
B00DW39B2K|3.0|This was an interesting film that just didn't go to where it could have gone - more into the characters and more action. Both had that sinister character in them, but the script just didn't take them into that place where the film became suspenseful nd reall good. Just mediocre! It seemed like filler roles for both Travolta and DeNiro.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is a very good book.  I am a bit of a sucker for dog stories.  The book takes you on the journey through Enzo's life and those around him.  It is how I would genuinely perceive a dog's thoughts.  They are such wonderful creatures.  Even if you are not a dog person, this is a good read.  Many valuable life lessons can be learned from our furry friends.  Definitely recommend.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Going back & watching this show again I relized that I had just taken for granted that any Stargate show was goiing to ne good. This show was GREAT not just good. Just take a look at Stargate Universe if you think they can't blow it with the brilliance of the Stargate series. Stargate Atlantis actually improved on the basics that were built in Stargate SG-1. I mean, IMHO, the writers took Stargate SG-1 and molded it into something even greater with their casting and their concepts - the villians, the heroes, the mythos .... This was a brilliant show! If you haven't seen it - you're so lucky to get to see it for the first time! I'd probably suggest you watch Stargate SG-1 first - or at least a few seasons of that show before watching Stargate Atlantis/ BUT the cool thing is, you don't actually have to do so. It's fantastic on it's own.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|An excellent dvd and reminds me of the first time I saw it.  Will keep it forever.  Thanks for the memories....
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The Elite is the second book in the dystopian series by Kiera Cass. In The Selection there were 35 girls and now in The Elite it is down to 6 girls. 6 girls and one of them has the change to be The One. The one that gets to marry Prince Maxon and change her life completely. America is one of the six and she is not sure if she wants to be with Maxon or with Aspen, who she was previously in love with before she became part of the Selection.<br /><br />With war growing stronger everyday between the Northerners and the Southerners, the Selection is getting more dangerous by the minute. Cat fights within the castle and real fighting outside.<br /><br />I love the selection of YA dystopia I've read so far. The Hunger Games was a awesome read, and The Selection series is great as well. I initially thought this series was The Bachelor meets YA dystopia, but it is growing into so much more.<br /><br />While I was reading The Elite I had so many emotions. As the war grows the feeling inside the castle is very intense. The castle gets invaded so many times and with each time there is the worry that someone involved in the Selection will be killed. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen!!<br /><br />In The Elite the reader learns a lot more about the history of Ilea, the castes system and how the country became the way it is today. It was really fascinating reading and left me wanting to read The One, the final book in the trilogy, now!!

B0015HOFZI|1.0|Quality was ok for the price, but you can't play through the computer. So you can't hear what you are recording. The software is overly complicated for someone who just wants to download their record collection. I'll keep looking for a player that simply works.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|It was different from the others and I loved every one of them so far.  Very nice job on this one!
B000HL09MG|5.0|To truly see the brilliance of this film, you have to look way below the surface. A lot of people think this movie is simply about relationships and sex, but it is far from that. Whether you believe in symbolism or not, there is no denying it is part of the film, and if you really want to get to where Kubrick was coming from it will take a few viewings, so be patient. I've read the novella from which this is based and the outline of the story is there, but Kubrick really pushed it to the limit. I'm also no fan of Tom Cruise and I have to say he was mesmerizing in this. Well done on all levels.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story, real fleshed out characters, you never know what happens next. Can't wait to read more about silo 18.
B00008NRI7|3.0|George Wade (Huge Grant), the owner of a huge construction company which tears down anything and everything of value in a community to put up skyscrapers, hires Lucy (Sandra Bullock), a non-profit lawyer who is a community activist, to be his company's in-house counsel.  Lucy does this against her better judgment and ends up being at George's beck and call 24/7, running her into the ground with his rather selfish needs and requests.  Luckily, George is utterly charming and handsome.  He does tip the scales in the favor of being TOO SELFISH when he actually calls Lucy out of a wedding in which she is the Maid of Honor to help him pick out some clothes...Lucy puts in her two week notice.<br /><br />This movie is totally predictable and fun at the same time.  It is definitely worth the price of a rental, but definitely not worth purchasing as watching it once is quite enough.  Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are very watchable actors.  This movie is a fun popcorn night with your friends.
1444737112|5.0|It is amazing what the love of a cat can do for you.  And I understand that cats aren't always into overt displays of affection!  James and Bob found each other and it was a very good thing for both of them.  They both learned trust, confidence and caring.  I want to know more about how they have got on since the end of the book.  Is there a sequel in the works?  Although, a sequel would not have the poignancy of the original, I'm sure.  I have already planned who should read this book next.  Any of my cat mama friends will enjoy it!
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best Tom Cruise movies I've ever seen!  This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen...LOTS of action with lots of surprises!  Rosamund Pike is excellent as the defense attorney for Jack Barr who is accused of being the sniper who killed 5 innocent people.  Barr only makes one request....get Jack Reacher (Cruise).  Reacher shows up, looks at all the evidence and begins to piece together a much different picture than what the evidence seems to show.  The bad guys are busy trying to tie up loose ends, but soon there are more loose ends than any bad guy can possibly tie up with Reacher involved.<br /><br />This movie is just plain FUN!  If you like action but also a plot that makes you think, this is the film for you.  I highly recommend it!
B008JFUPOY|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 4.2 / 5<br />video - 5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br /><br />excellent video and audio throughout this blu ray disc, as most animation<br />are these days.<br />movie may not be as perfect as the first, but it is still<br />enjoyable watching it. great for the kids.<br />a must have to demo your home theater system.<br />recommended...
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|This movie has lots of good points, but when the lead actor just doesn't fit the role, it's difficult to call it a 5 star film.  I've seen James Franco in many films, and he is a good actor.  In \\"Oz\\", he appears to be trying too hard and not making it.  Mila Kunis is fantastic as the witch, Theodora!  She brings so much personality to her role.  Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams are also extremely good in their roles as witches.  This movie is a prequel to The Wizard of Oz and answers a lot of questions from that film.  Oz is a con artist from a carnival who is fleeing from the boyfriend or husband of one of the many women he has been wooing.  He leaves his black and white land in a hot air balloon and gets caught up in a tornado and flung to a land far, far away.  He lands in a colorful land and meets Theodora who is beautiful, sweet and sensitive.  She falls for his womanizing ways and thinks she is in love with him.  NO SPOILERS FROM ME!  I will say that the CGI in many places was pretty bad (such as backgrounds, for example).  It is an interesting story but takes a while to get to the good part...the original movie didn't have that problem.  I definitely recommend renting it, but I wouldn't buy it.
B00867HDTA|4.0|Cool fun game to mess around with when you're really bored. I've never been one that was interested in soccer, but this games makes it fun and interesting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I actually loved this book best. It had a realism of war, PTSD, and in a world like that, a realistic happy ending. This book is the one that won me over.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is truly brillaint. It is beautifully written and shows you a more tender side of the spirit of death. You will laugh, you will cheer, you will shutter in disgust and fear, you will cry but you will be better for it. I loved this book.
1603420398|5.0|The variety of ideas and patterns in this book is both mind-boggling and deeply satisfying.  Motifs can be joined and worked in so many combinations, and there are so many to start with - executed with lovely and various colors, this book is beautifully organized and designed.  I'm dipping into it again and again when I'm not diving into it for longer.  Lovely to hold and to read.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|It was funny, I can say that I liked it better the Hangover II. The things those guys get into! The segment in the middle of the end credits was a funny shocker!!!!!

B007SGLZP8|3.0|This is a good book.  At times I had to check the cover to be sure it was a Grisham work.  It was and well spun.  It was not in the Top 10 or 15 best books ever, but it is a good read.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|It look like the paranormail activity movies are starting to get worst as they come out.  I don't think this one was as good as the other three, a wast of my money to watch this movie.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|I must admit that I'm really frustrated that I wasted 99 coins on this app. Google search is free and includes gmail. This app only works in the landscape position and would not let me see what I was typing in a long email which was really annoying. I wish there was a way to return apps!
B00AFEY354|5.0|I love that this movie came with the plastic wrap like you would see in stores. It insured me that my movie had never been opened, but as anyone does I checked the back of the disk to be sure. As I would have guessed it was clean and scratch free. I love that it came with a Digital Download code, I am always watching movies on my computer. This product was well worth it. I greatly enjoy the story line, as well as the acting. I hope you enjoyed this review.

B00F7YHDWC|3.0|I mean this game is ok but like for real is this really the best amazon can do for their kindle fires?? I see apps on the featured app of the day where not even one person has wrote a review about. I mean like come on is angry birds and minecraft really the best you can do?? I demand better apps at least apps that are somewhat up to date like for real you don't even have infinity blade or pac man this just shows that we should be able to choose what app store we want to use not the irrational amazon appstore in which the 4th best free app is a game no one who uses apple has ever heard of so to amazon get it together and get some apps going on with no ripoffs PLEASE

B00EDX5QNG|5.0|Psychic seamlessly melds multiple genres (house, psychedelica and so on) into one atmospheric and monstrous album. Some of the licks and the tit-for-tat guitar and beat work on this LP are forces to be dealt with. One moment you're drifting among colourful particles of sound and the next you're inside a warped and malicious world reminiscent of Knopfler's style. This not to say that Psychic copies their influences, but more so it grasps the emotional or cathartic highs of those idols and genres, stips them of any non-essential qualities and puts them on elegant display.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I saw season 2 and now I'm recording season 3 but never saw this first one.  So far I've seen 5 episodes and they are great!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to download on smart-phone or desktop computer.  Very easy to navigate  to find what you need. Convenient too .
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Make sure you read Brandon's notes at the end as this seems to be set in a familiar world, with a few so far unseen rules.  My only issue was the length...  I wish I could read more.  Typical good job by Sanderson.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I'm used to watching those slow \\"walkers\\" on Sunday night which is more my speed. The zombies are much faster in this movie so it was really scary. Plus they climb fast in large swarms like I've never seen. Amazing how Brad PItt keeps his cool but then I should have expected it. He tolerates pain well.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It was difficult at first to get use to the individuals who played the parts--I have seen the stage play 7 times--but once adjusting to voices--except for Russell Crowe's--the movie drew you in and took your breath away at times.  Anne Hathaway's main scene had you holding your breath and she made you feel her pain.  Then the surprise of seeing the priest who was one of a few Jean-val-Jeans in the original stage production--absolutely loved the ending.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|This is a really fun game. Sort of like Magic but on a board. Controls can get a bit touchy but thats about it.

B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is an entertaining puzzle style game to challenge your brain. It's fun, addicting and a good game to keep you busy and burn some time.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|It crashes so often, especially when you are about to get a reward. After 341 days playing daily, it asked me to download an update. It was impossible, it just took me to the Apps on my Kindle Fire and from there I could only open the game. A couple of days after that, I could finally opened the game and I had to spend 15 acorns to keep my daily reward. And, from yesterday, it is impossible to open the application. Don't waste your time with this game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am totally hooked! I was skeptical, but not anymore. I can not wait for season four to start. I wish it started this month.
1616551151|5.0|If you are into the DA lore, then this book is a must. Its full of information about the races, places and ideologies that DA is so rich in. Knowing the lore for fans of the series is a great way to keep hyped up for DA:I out in 2014. I would really recommend this book, not just because of its information, but because alot of thought was put into building this world, and this book. My favorite feature is the timeline on the bottom of each page. The timeline tell you when certain events happened, and where we are now in the universe.
0375703764|5.0|Wow!  A fantastic plunge into the depths of the mind.  An extraordinary book that is imaginative and essentially has the rare ability to touch every reader on some level.  All of the characters are connected, to this same mind blowing story, in their own very personal way. They are all so inherently different from one another but, somehow, similar because of their lifelong secrets, vulnerabilities and unique coping abilities.<br /><br />The way the book moved through so many bizarre paths simultaneously, kept me puzzled and addicted. Throughout reading this, the opening for the old, 1970's, TV show, &#34;Night Gallery&#34;, kept flashing through my head. (re.YouTube).  Creepy-weird, but always a good mystery.  A separate physical and mental experience was in store for each of the characters that were brave enough to become involved in this quest for answers; where in the end, there may not be any.  Emotions and morals are all questioned, exposed, and very much in play.  This distinct type of editing was exciting, complex and at times perpendicular, so jump on in and enjoy the ride, I did, and will be thinking about this book for a long time...<br />&#34;for as leaves are to limbs, so are words to your soul&#34;, House of Leaves
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This movie leaves you at the edge of your seat from the very beginning! The cast is fabulous and has great chemistry.<br />Everyone in this movie from the director (JJ Abrams), the producers and the actors did a great job; I hope that they keep making movies as great as this one for the old and new generations of Star Trek fans.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Absolutely love this CD....  it deserves 10 stars.  Her voice is excellent and lyrics and music....  just an all around 10.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|This was a typical zombie movie. The main difference was the zombies are &#34;fast movers&#34;. Seemed like a spin off of Resident Evil with the ship sanctuary.

B0038AUYJ6|5.0|A clever, witty pastiche which plays with and employs postmodern concerns and techniques. Brings to &#34;life&#34; a real/fictional Gustave Flaubert, author of 'Madame Bovary', by means of the book's narrator, Geoffrey Braithwaite, whose own &#34;story&#34; gradually emerges as he tracks down  the &#34;real&#34; parrot of the novel's title.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am always looking for quick methods to find my inner guidance as I find it difficult to meditate for long periods of time. Pam has done it. This is such an easy step by step method of achieving your success and mind power.  Pam makes reading this book very light hearted and fun yet still manages to get you to find that deep inner guidance most of us struggle to find and work with. I have started the experiments for myself and one example when I used the Volkswagen Jetta Approach, I decided to see a Praying Mantis (not a very common sight were I live), to test this theory.  Well needless to say, I did not see the praying mantis within the 48 hours I had specified, but it did fly right into my kitchen 6 days later. ....... A fabulous book. Thank you Pam.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I am sure it was because I am introvert who loves reading. I think that every personality type would enjoy the book.  It gives in insight not only to introverts but to extroverts as well.  It was very well written. The author used a good combination of stories and scientific evidence.  I have recommended this book to every one I know.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Before my phone had a timer, clock, and that other function I never used, this was fantastic to use. It was reliable compared to my older smart phones and I never needed to upgrade. Used the free version and it really had everything covered. Timer for cooking. Alarm for work and class. I don't need it anymore though.
B002DJSBMA|5.0|I have watched this many times and am certain that I will be watching it many more times.<br />I do not watch many movies more than once but my kids (teenagers) and myself have a list of movies that we do watch from time to time and this is one of those.<br />Its a good story and it makes you think, about life, and death, in a different perspective.<br /><br />Certainly worth the watch.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was afraid our Internet connection might be too slow because we have trouble loading  YouTube videos on the PC, but this works flawlessly with Netflix and our wifi.  Best electronic device ever for such a low price.  Easy to install and access via iPad, iPhone or PC.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I absolutely love Katy Perry and I absolutely love this movie. It has a perfect balance between Katy's offstage and onstage life. The movie really made me feel emotionally for Katy. I loved the parts after the concerts when she did the meet and greets. It just made me want to hug her! This was one of those good movies that made me cry when the main character was crying.I also really loved the parts when she was in concert. I love all her clothes and it was weird to see her without makeup on. My favorite Katy Perry song, Part of Me, is the title of the movie. I think this title suits the movie very well. The movie is all about being yourself and not letting anyone keep you from being you. That song is my favorite because of that theme. Overall, I think this movie is amazing and inspiring to everyone, not just Katy Perry fans, and I completely and totally LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie. I would recommend it to anyone. :D

B00594XOZU|1.0|I have tried to long in to my KIK and it says loading then it says An error has accrued. Somebody need to fix the issue. I used KIK daily, but I can't anymore
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works as advertised. Would give 5 stars if it worked with more apps or anything displayed in my browser. Given the limitations I am more likely to use AirPlay through Apple TV along with AirParrot to project from my PC.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Engaging and believable.  The time period clothes & spoken diction is incredible.  Still wanting more & ready for the next season.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I am a huge fan of this game and love the fact that Amazon lets you download it to non tablet devices.  Gameplay is smooth and engaging on my Note 2 and iMito MX2.  I have noticed that my battery does get drained quickly using this app.  I also noticed that somtimes the game glitches and buttons lose their text descriptions.  Overall though, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is into Magic: The Gathering or wants to learn how to play MTG.  One question I have is why this intall is over double the Android Market install.  The game is 1.5 GB then downloads another almost 1.5 GB in content.  I read that the Market does not have this problem.  Maybe Amazon can look into why this is happening and get us a smaller install?
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I was marathon watching so I could be ready for Season 5. It just kept getting better. Love the diversity of the show too.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|My daugther tried it but the game keeps on crashing and also you have to buy coins. Not worth it
B001224WBS|5.0|Awesome!! I LOVED them in the 80's, saw them live for the 1st time ever over the summer :) fabulous!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|too much advertising, not good for little ones who can press on anything without knowing.<br />Maybe for older kids @ 6
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great products. It works better with my WIFI than my Roku. BUT, the Chromecast need more enabled apps. First the Chromecast needs Amazon instant Video app to be enable. The Chrome browser on smart phones and iPads need to have the chromecast button. I love the price of this piece of hardware.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I was in high school when this movie was released in theaters in the '80's. That's when I first saw it and was swept away by it then.  When Ben Kingsley won the Oscar for his breakout performance in which he all but channeled Mahatma Gandhi, I was ecstatic. He's been one of my favorite actors ever since, never ceasing to disappoint (i.e., Schindler's List). Thus said, I'd forgotten just how wonderful this film still is until I watched it again when I bought this disc.  I love the extras on it with Dir. Sir Richard Attenborough, Kingsley and others. I loved seeing a very young Daniel Day-Lewis's performance (a bit part) in this film. If you blink, you'll miss it.  If you love Ben Kingsley as I do, you must have this edition of Gandhi.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was such a well-written book!  It was hard to believe that it was the author's first published work.<br />Janet
B00AB65SVE|5.0|I have to admit, I didn't get a chance to watch much of this season when it actually aired, but it was well worth buying because I nearly bust a gut when I watch it.  By far, my favorite episode is &#34;Fulgencio,&#34; Modern Family's send-up of the first Godfather film. Hilarious!
B00A0SLTCU|1.0|An echo of a really good movie from a rather up / down author.<br /><br />PV was right to extrapolate.<br /><br />-r.c.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My 4 year old daughter gave it a high 5!<br />She loved it as much as I did as a child.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I found this to be a thoughtful and inspiring message about maximizing brain health as well as many other aspects of health.  I have implemented the plan in my life.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book completely lives up to all the hype.  It's funny, sexy, well-written and hard to put down.  A must read for all new adult/romance lovers.
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|I've enjoyed the series so far. Not always the best acting, but interesting story lines and perspective in the Star Trek universe.
0385351399|2.0|Personally, I think the author just ran out of interest in the story.  Or ideas about where to take it. The ending is SO unsatisfying and weak. He set up a lot of great arguments to go one way or the other. I always felt he (she) would choose the other. But, in the end, she didn't and I expected such a better explanation of the rational.<br /><br />Bottom line: the book offers some interesting and very contemporary philosophical arguments. But, after you turn the last page, all you can wonder is 'that's it'?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I chose this rating because the end gave off the whole idea of the book. It made me feel like if I was August I Would be very happy about my life.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is well put together best free game on the market..the only thing that would make this game better is if you could trap the security guard for a lil while other then that very nice game overall
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great script and acting.  Each episode builds on the previous one but is also strong enough to stand alone.  I like all the characters and their continual development in the scripts.  One of my favorite series.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|As a sports car racer myself and having seen the old vhs version of this 20 times or more, this brings Le Mans back to a new level. The audio and clarity is exceptional. Best racing film ever. As good as RUSH and NO computer generated stuff.
B007R108WA|2.0|I stopped viewing this after about 30 minutes.  The plot is interesting but the character is so disgusting that I couldn't continue.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I geared up for delving into a true murder mystery. The premise of the novel caught my attention and I was hooked from the beginning. However, the ending was a bit of a letdown that left me somewhat disappointed.
1250030951|4.0|Cath writes fan fiction with her twin sister/best friend, Wren. I mean, Cath writes and Wren edits. It's kind of the perfect team. They write the fan fiction based on a book that is so very similar to Harry Potter. Their stories are pretty much as popular as the actual book. They are kind of a big deal. Then they go to college.<br /><br />I love Rowell's writing style. She is the perfect amount of sarcastic mixed with actual good writing. Her characters are realistic and believable, and a lot of teens will relate to them. This story is perfect for those about to go to college as well as those that are there. It is a book I would have devoured when I was a freshman in college, something I could have related to. No, I don't write fan fiction, but I do love Harry Potter, and I was a bit of a recluse in college.<br /><br />Cath is the sarcastic introvert. Wren is the semi-alcoholic party girl. They have always been together. They were there for their dad when their mom left. They were there all the times he fell into depression. College comes along, and all of a sudden Wren doesn't want to spend as much time with Cath. Cath doesn't have as much time to write her story. No one has enough time to make sure Dad doesn't fall back into depression. And then Mom shows up. There is a lot going on here, a lot for a variety of people to relate to. It is a very large book though, so it wasn't all crammed in. And then of course there are roommates and boys.<br /><br />This is just a 4 star for me. It was wonderful, and I really enjoyed reading it, but it wasn't sensational. The story was entertaining but nothing too special. The ending was too cookie cutter. Just like in [[ASIN:1250012570 Eleanor & Park]], I felt it was a build up to an anticlimactic event that never really happened. Definitely worth a read if you like good writing and sarcasm.
B00BPA7U34|5.0|I enjoy every song on this CD.  He has a wonderful, clear voice and can hit high notes with ease.  I keep it in the CD player of my car and listen often.
B00FPH6M82|1.0|Poor acting, story line was boring and Will Smith was depressing with no personality. They could've done so much more. Disappointed all around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|&quot;It's fun and perfect because I earn levels.&quot; She loves it but I have to help her with it a lot.  She's 4.5
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Something new to learn everyday. Love the history! I don't think I've ever watched time pieces quite like Downton Abbey. You're constantly engaged with the characters.
B006S08RLU|5.0|This is the fourth copy I've bought,  people borrow it and love it so much they end up keeping it!
B000Q76K1A|5.0|Amazing movie set in a beautiful place. It keeps one on the edge of their seat while taking them to beautiful places I've never before been.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not at all what I was expecting.  A well told story from the point(s) of those who caught the A<br />Zombies.  Loved it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I'm not sure if I had heard of this show, but Amazon suggested I try it, and I'm so glad of it. The show is smart without being condescending, keeping a great balance of humor and drama.
0515153656|5.0|I have not read a Jack Reacher book that I didn't love.  Lee Child is a genius.  Every book has been over the top!
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Just recently started watching Breaking Bad, can't wait to finish the first season. Jumped on the Breaking Bad band wagon in the last season.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|this game is ok and you need to buy 50 gems which is like 50 dollors in real life. only get it if u will spend 50 dollars
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|I saw this in theaters and have been enthusiastically awaiting the DVD so that I could see it again. I was surprised that it wasn't an adaption, but was true to Shakespeare's original script. Many people seem to have that as their biggest criticism. I thought it was a delightful surprise! It takes talented actors to pull of many of the hilarious lines that Shakespeare wrote and this group did it marvelously! I also found the setting to add to the film. When a man is swooning over a photo and looking ridiculous, it really adds to the scene to have him in a little girl's bedroom where all the stuffed animals are wearing tiaras. It just makes it all the more funny! But I guess some people don't get that. As for the black and white: if you desperately need color to enjoy a movie, I feel bad for you.<br />Overall this was incredibly enjoyable and laugh out loud funny. I recommend it highly to any Shakespear and Joss Whedon fan. (I think it's important to have both in order to really enjoy this)
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I think that this game is dumb because you cant even move and I have no idea how to do this
B00FPH6A70|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  Oneof the ascariest movies of the year 2013! Lovvvvved it very very very much !
B008P1EWIM|5.0|The moving screen is wonderful.  The moon oh yes the the rotation of the moon l would recommend this app.I like it.
B00AAU7AI0|5.0|Life changing book....to be preserved for generations ....I would rate this better than the Alchemist.  This is Paulo coelho at his best
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Sean Connery as James Bond--- what is the question-- [peeeerrrrrrrrrrrrfect!! He should have done more of those-- he IS James \Bond
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play Bingo Blitz on my kindle fire. This is a fun app, the display is great and its colorful. I did have a problem with an in app purchase which amazon refunded my money. The only other down fall is you don't get enough daily credits in my opinion, so I have to save up some to play more than 1-2 games a day for the higher level rooms. Besides that this is a addicting app.
B007THA4FI|5.0|It's hard to believe so much envy,spite and neuroses could exist in one small village, but Rowling puts it all together to make a compelling and disturbing,yet intriguing story. The characters are complex.  Some will disgust you, some will break your heart.  Some will make you angry and some will redeem themselves. But they will all rivet your heart and mind to this remarkable story.  Bravo, J.K.Rowling.
0446581348|4.0|Almost gave it five stars......bought this book for the wonderful information regarding make-up application.  Lots of good tips.  Why didn't I give it five stars?  It's about make-up!  I find other subjects more interesting.  If I didn't have that forty-year class reunion to attend, I would not have bothered......ha!  ha!  (The tips worked...felt like Cinderella!?)
B001BANK32|5.0|The first time I read the shining I was an awestruck teenager, now reading it for the third time I'm delighted to still be impressed. Truly one of King's best. This time through the story of Jack Torrance's struggle with alcohol & anger captivated me almost more than the Overlook's growing hold over him ... All the more frightening for being so close to home. Now, off to read Doctor Sleep!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This Game Is So Much Fun. It's Hard To Put Down. The Level Keep You Entertained. Keeps My Kids Busy And That's Worth It :-)!
0345803485|1.0|Wondering why this book was number one on the New York Times bestseller list for weeks on end, I thought about buying it but decided to browse through it in the bookstore first.  Smartest thing I ever did.  After reading ten pages, I threw it back on the shelf like it was something toxic.  I have never read such abominably written tripe in all my life.  The writing is so bad it actually made my back teeth hurt.  And this thing is a best-seller?  What in the world is wrong with people?!<br /><br />Judy Lind
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|this is a phenomenal album! very different and is def good music. I would highly recommend this album so you can let your ears here some REAL MUSIC!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Easy download. Grandson approved.Will recommend to others. Can hardly wait for next version to be available. Thanks for this game.
B004LROUNG|3.0|This is great story. I could not put the book down. I highly recommend it!  I rate it 5 Stars.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|The Beatles were one of the Greatest (if not the Ultimate) band of their time.  But what astounds is how they so deftly and effortlessly created their masterpieces, one after another.  This was the beginning of the band's more mature phase but in retrospect, so much happened in such a short time after they had launched their first album just back in 1963.  The progress made was so natural, yet seismic.  Perhaps mass success beyond imagination drove them into introspection and a more real sound.<br /><br />Rubber Soul was their most reflective album to date and defies comparison.  Somehow the Beatles knew how to balance their repertoire.  Some innate instincts between Lennon & McCartney acted as a check and balance against mediocrity and repetition.  Their covers and musical cliches were largely gone by this time.  And Revolver would continue the flow of creatively seamlessly not long after.<br /><br />Once the Beatles discovered their true musical geniuses, they were never the same.  Rubber Soul was a pivotal step in that journey.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's a great game you can make what you want and have cake . You will love this game and do not mine at night.
0385345054|4.0|Really nice visuals. Some of the directions are difficult to follow, Overall a good purchase. You def. get better as you keep doing them and make your own styles etc.
B00FHSQKZ4|5.0|The description says, &quot;Its available in 2 languages, English, Russian and Polish.&quot; That's just funny!! I hope they write alarm clock apps better thaan they count!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book because I saw the preview for the movie and it looks super interesting and I had never heard of the book before. I had never heard of the author before and didn't know how horrifying his views were before reading the book.  Thankfully I can put aside my negative response to him as a person and review the book as a story.  I really enjoyed this book a lot.  It is a great sci-fi epic tale with a lot of story to tell. You really feel for Ender as a character quickly and he's a likable person even if everything he does is not always likable.  You still are able to empathise with him as a character.  There's a middle bit with his siblings that went a little too political for me and there's a lot of weird mind games going on but it's still an epic tale.  I'm sure there are a lot of littary parts to this that someone more intelligent than me can point out, but from a simple lay person who likes to read science fiction, this was a good book.  This was written rather completely enough that I felt no need to expand up on the series, I liked the ending where it left off personally, but apparently there are a lot of other books in the series if you want to expand the experience.<br /><br />Now, the write of the series has since said a lot of things that I very much dissagree with and I'm not sure if I would have bought this book had I known his point of view earlier. However I did love the book so I'm happy to at least have had the opportunity to read this either way.  Whether or not I agree with Mr. Card personally does not mean he's not a good writer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awsome and fun to play all day. I love the minnons there so cute and funny. everyone should buy it, its free!
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I enjoy playing this game very much.  The matches keep you strategizing.  The mazes are fun also.  Keep going all
B003O86FMW|4.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I saw the first movie before I read the book, but still read the book anyways. I read the book in about a week.<br />Catching Fire is full of action and movement from the beginning. I wondered what more could go on since the last book completed the games. This book came right in and stole my breathe to see that the characters had to go back into the arena. It was refreshing to see the character progression and their willingness to take a stand.
0486266885|3.0|I would give the story five stars and the edition one star.  I'm referring only to the Dover Thrift &#34;Green Edition&#34; here.  I guess they are being green by using as little paper as possible for the book.  But the type face is so small and the layout so cramped that, along with Stevenson's run on sentences, it is a chore to read.  And the font used is dated and not pleasing to the eye at all.  My recommendation is to buy a different edition and enjoy reading this classic.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|Got it for my daughter, cant beat getting a classic in so many formats for the price, especially the digital copy, great for keeping room on my daughters tablet but still having instant access
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. The story line was one that I really enjoyed. Very aggrevating going back and forth.
0756407125|5.0|The Wise Man's Fear, like The Name of the Wind, transported me to its world effortlessly and with just the right mixture of elation and fear. I feel I know Kvothe, Denna, Devi, Auri, and the rest as well, perhaps better, than I know the people in my own life. My favorite fantasy series, hands down. Now we all just have to keep holding on for the finale.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I love eureka. I have been watching it since it came out. I love technology & this is just packed with it !<br />I wish we had a lot of the stuff for real. Every episode is awesome.<br />I like the plots that every episode has too. It is well scripted & I Totally think this show is Awesome !
B005XRU62C|5.0|I have no words for how much I love this album.  Ms. Welch's voice is out of this world and she is a musical genius.  Kudos to you, Florence.
1405911662|4.0|Good characters with different but entwining lives and agendas.  It  causes you to think about the choices made and what you might have done  you were in the situations presented.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|All three of these books were terrible. I only read them because it was announced Charlie Hunnam was cast as Christian Grey. Now that he's out, these books were a complete waste of money and time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think Mockingjay is the most interpretative one of all the three books: There are many issues for you to think about after reading it. You will get something more than just entertainment.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|All three of these books were terrible. I only read them because it was announced Charlie Hunnam was cast as Christian Grey. Now that he's out, these books were a complete waste of money and time.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Karl Urban never takes off the helmet so if you wanted to see his handsome face,<br />you won't get to in this film.  I'm not a Dredd fan, so this review is from the<br />perspective of someone that wanted to enjoy the sight of Karl Urban, and only got<br />to see his lips and chin.<br /><br />This action film has all the shooting and strategizing against<br />the bad guys that you'd expect, but the director adds some very interesting, colorful<br />(not just red) angles and shots (pun intended) that make this different than<br />the regular shoot 'em up movies.<br /><br />Dredd is on the job and testing a rookie at the same time.  His and his partner's near<br />heroic and impossible against all odds adventure appears to be a typical day on the job,<br />nothing that would cause Dredd to sweat or worry. He goes into a large village of a building<br />where unemployment is greater than 90%.  Soon Dredd and his rookie partner are in<br />a battle between them and Ms. Drug Lord, who placed a reward on killing Dredd so that<br />even the citizens will be interested in bringing Dredd & rookie down.<br /><br />I gave it four stars due to the interesting slow motion sequences because it was very<br />different, colorful and there was much to see in these shots, something different enough<br />that it's not a regular action hero flick.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought this was the best book I've read in a long time and have recommended it to many others.<br />Each character was so well described and I could just see them all, and feel there pain.  Really enjoyed this book.
B008Y212PI|4.0|The devs really could've come up with something more creative to put this game into.  It's a great idea, kind of like a modern day Minesweeper.  A Sodoku brain teaser in a way.  It really could catch on if the background wasn't so boring!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|If the girl woulda grown up to ultimately be the rightful owner of the druglords land and came back she could've avenged her family's right to the land. That woulda been a better plot. As a result the ending fell flat.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|I caught myself playing this for a long time.  It's quite simple.  The graphics could be better.  It's a good idea that's cheaply executed.  I wouldn't pay for this, EVER though!
0307476073|5.0|I admit I'm a bit puzzled by the negative reviews of this book. Maybe I found Strayed and her story more personally relatable than others, but I loved every minute of it and have missed her since we parted ways at the end of the trail. I reveled in her completely un-aplogetic attitude towards men and sex -- although it didn't seem entirely healthy, she had the guts to buck societal norms and approach sex more like men do. I understand that she was apparently woefully prepared for the hike but as a non-hiker, I didn't pay much attention to that. What I did pay attention to was the telling of her story, which was interesting, heartbreaking, absorbing and ultimately liberating. Over the course of her hike she seemed to accept and gain a better understanding of her life's events--especially the loss of her mother. Saying her experience was cathartic is stating the obvious, but her catharsis was not cliche. I found it to be believable and hard-earned. I think her writing is excellent and imo she is a real talent. I for one will be keeping an eye on this gifted story-teller.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|I downloaded this as the FAOTD and it reminded me of a game called Osmosis I got as the FAOTD as well.  I loved that game and the fish game was quite similar but a little easier to understand since it was easy to tell bad fish rather than bad cells.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting twists and turns well woven diverse character perspectives. Loved the epilogue of unknown changes of course to the lives of the characters had they only known.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Its not just me Vintage Trouble are a close your eyes and play from the soul kind of band<br />my best description of their sound is that to me they sound like a modern day Wilson Pickett Band<br />the vocals the soul of the music, the passion the soul the feeling of the music of the past comes alive with these young Musicians they will take over your CD and MP3 and home Stereo Players  they will take your Soul by storm and even if your as old as me they will make your creaky bones want to Dance.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is one of those rare books you can't seem to put down. The characters and world is so immersive you sometimes forget you're just reading a book. The story is one of the most unique I've ever read.
B008BZIUHG|5.0|these guys are truly have the sound of a 60s and 70s era band<br />they don't have that trying to copy a sound kind of sound they sound like this is the style that just comes naturally to them<br />they have the rocking distorted guitars they sound bigger than a three piece band<br />they make me want to see them live if you like to Rock then Rival Sons might just your music
B008AK8FHM|5.0|About time a professional wrote about science and realized the true existence of God.He explained all the circumstances of his coma and how he was able to decipher all the dialogue said around his sick bed.Amazing and enlightening.

B00FEHXCIG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot.  I forgot how entertaining the Iron Man series was, but my husband remembered and picked Iron Man 3 to watch without hesitation, which is unusual for him.
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|While this movie started out well and has some cool special effects the story of dead cop getting a second chance just doesn't make it .... maybe it was Keven Bacon that killed the movie.
B001JU4S44|5.0|He's such a good actor and this movie shows some of his best work. This is one of the best MI movies of the series and I love watching them all and so will you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
