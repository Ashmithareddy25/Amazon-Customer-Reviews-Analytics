B000002N3N|5.0|THE MEMORY OF TREES, combines esoteric grandeur, various historical Gaelic elements, enigmatic phrases, with lyrics that brace the line between comprehension and obscurity in a most effective way.  This was my first Enya album ever, and I'm really glad I started my collection with it.  Out of all of Enya's many albums, it sets a mood the best.  Starting with the breathtaking 4:19 title track instrumental, Enya begins to create a mood of happiness tempered by reflection, so effectively with vocals that are both haunting and joyous along with magnificent instrumentation.  This song then moves to the fast-paced \\"Anywhere Is\\" (one of two singles off the cd).  \\"Anywhere Is,\\" may be the most heavily lyrical based Enya single, but she quickly goes through them all, painting a feeling of a journey, of choices made, following a course, and misdirection.  Part of what makes this song so successful is the abundant rhyming; Enya's lively, vital voice; and its rhythm.  \\"Pax Deorum,\\" five minutes of amazing Latin, certainly sets a mood, with a darker tone.  It's a powerful song, with apparent voice layering, amazing instrumentation, and a very good beat.  The passion of \\"Pax Deorum\\" segues into the elegance and beauty of the Gaelic \\"Athair ar Neamh\\" (meaning \\"Father in Heaven\\").  This song is truly beautiful, with Enya lightly moving through the gorgeous Gaelic stanzas.  \\"China Roses,\\" which clocks in at 4:47, is a majestic masterpiece, painting a scene with ethereal elements, and has a Utopian feeling about it.  The synthesizer on this piece is quite remarkable, fitting the tone of \\"China Roses\\" perfectly.  \\"Hope Has a Place,\\" is romantic, true to life, and, judging from the way Enya sings it, very introspective.  It features some of the grander elements of songs like \\"Angeles\\" and \\"Caribbean Blue\\" from Shepherd Moons, incorporating sweeping, drawn out stanzas and peaceful, heartfelt lyrics.  \\"Tea-House Moon,\\" is playful, with an almost circus like feeling.  \\"Once You Had Gold,\\"is a serene, elegant and genteel.  Many sections of the song are done in the way you'd expect a lullaby to be done; yet it has more practical application than a lullaby, with very truthful lyrics that touch the soul.  \\"La Soñadora\\" is as majestic as it is an auditory delight, especially with the edition of the Spanish lyrics.  The darker feeling in the beginning segues brilliantly into the chorus of voices in the middle section of the song and then concludes with the same feeling of the beginning.  \\"On My Way Home\\" (the second single off THE MEMORY OF TREES), is an upbeat, happy, and retrospective song that signals the end of the remarkable journey that is THE MEMORY OF TREES.  It's a fitting conclusion to \\"Anywhere Is\\" and the entire cd.<br />THE MEMORY OF TREES encompasses various themes, various languages, and incorporates stunning instrumentals throughout.  Enya has frequently said she tells a lot about herself through her music, and I think that's particularly apparent in THE MEMORY OF TREES, which, by the end of its 44 minutes, truly moves you.  If it's the first piece in your Enya collection or last, it certainly does not disappoint.
0671004107|5.0|A pioneering piece of literature written by one of the pre eminant physicysts of our time. I was very much impressed by the author's writing ability, considering his background of very much academic and scientific work.<BR> At last contact has been established with a foriegn life form, from a distant solar system. This book delves into how the earth as a whole might respond to a situation where everyone has to work together to achieve the desired goal. It also brings to light the classic, but somewhat sleepy struggle of scientific evolutionary principles versus literal interpretation of the Bible. Great dialogue and a wonderful array of perspectives make this book an adventurous and intriguing one to read. This book is well written, and gave me a real sense of the vastness and beauty found in our universe.
6304293321|5.0|&quot;Born Free&quot; is a true story about the adoption of a wild lion cub by a game warden in Kenya and his wife who are eventually confronted with two choises, either carrying out the tedious task of introducing the cub back to the wild in three months, or sacrificing her freedom by giving her to a zoo. The two people go through everything that is inevitable when you have a large cat for a pet. The film has its share of emotional moments like when the Adamsons get the cubs to lap up milk for the first time, and the time when the adolescent Elsa is isolated for a few days and is found wounded and unstable. But they are well balanced out with the amusing situations like Elsa riding on the hood of the truck and her bringing a two year-old elephant calf to the camp etc. <br />The film is so polished and of high quality that unless one is aware that it was made in '66, he/she will undoubtedly be lead to think that it was made in at least 1980. I was really surprised. I will add however, that I watched the film on TV yesterday for the first time and that is what my review is based on. Anyway I doubt the VHS is any different. So clever is the film in getting its points and objectives across that even people who aren't into wildlife movies will enjoy this, as I observed while I was watching. You have to admit, you don't often see a lioness swimming in the ocean and playing &quot;foot&quot; ball, do you? Also, the film runs for around 1 hour &amp; 40 minutes. Long enough for you? I strongly recommend this film to anyone.
0446677450|5.0|I think every student should read this book!  It is very inspirational and can help students understand that education is important, but it's not going to be the complete payoff.  As students we are all to often fooled by people to think if we go to school and get an education that we will be rich.  This is not the case.  We have to work hard and save for ourselves.  Again, this is a great book and I would reccomend it to everyone, EXPECIALLY STUDENTS!!!
B00004U8H4|1.0|Now let me start by saying, if I could have given this &quot;film&quot; a zero, I would have.  Unfortunatly that is not possible.  <br />This is by far, the worst film I have seen this year.  Mary Harron was trying way to hard and it shows.  The movie has very little substance to it, and people seem to be fond of attaching vague statements to their reviews like &quot;brillant satire&quot; and &quot;amazing mind games.&quot;  None of these terms can rescue this movie however, as it is a feeble attempt at art, a meaningless and shallow depiction of rich white business men in the 1980's, and a totally unconvincing portrait of a serial killer.<br />As far as the acting in this film I was not impressed with Christian Bales protrait of a man with no conscience.  The dialogue was to &quot;clever&quot; to be believable, or even stomachable.  Bale's voice over's are painful and irritating to listen to. <br />What upsets me most about this film, is not the film itself but the tendency for people to compare it to either Clockwork Orange or Fight Club.  American Pyscho does not begin to compare to either film, although their were some shots(most notably towards the end) that seemed to emulate Kubricks style, but they do no justice to the late genius.  As far as comparing it to Fight Club, the narrative style, and structure of the two films are vaguely similar, although Fight Club is on an entirely different level.<br />All in all, American Pyscho will fade into oblivion within the next few years.  There is absolutely no good reason to watch this movie as you will gain nothing from it.  I apologize for being a little vague in this review myself, but I was so dissappointed in the film, that a second viewing is simply out of the question.
B000002J1O|5.0|This is quite simply rock music of the very highest order. This album has a range and breadth of expression which is rarely found even in the work of Genesis. The influences range through many types of rock to folk, and some parts of Cinema Show seem to border on jazz-fusion. Wonderful playing from all concerned, particularly Tony Banks, whose solos on this recording reached new heights of virtuosity and expression. The recorded sound is also very fine, easily outstripping that of their previous studio album, Foxtrot.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|We originally had ET on VHS but we played it so many times, especially for the Grandchildren, that it litterally wore out.<BR>We have discovered that DVD color and sound is so much better we<BR>now have requested it when the stock arrives.<BR>The story itself is for &quot;children of all ages&quot;.
6305696071|5.0|Pretty Woman is an excellent movie in my opinion. Its about Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts),  a hooker who is working on Hollywood Boulevard  one night with her friend Kit De Luca (Laura San Giacomo). Around the corner comes a Lotust and the person in that car is none other than Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), a heartless business man on his way to the Regent Beverly Wiltshire Hotel. The car then stalls (he doesnt know how to work a stick shift) and thats when him and Roberts meet.  Gere then takes Roberts to the hotel with him and before she knows it hes asking her to stay with him the whole week for $3,000.<BR> Some of the cast members include Jason Alexander as Philip Stuckey, Edwards trusty lawyer, Ralph Bellamy as James Morse, the man whos company Edwards firm is trying to take over, Alex Hyde-White as David Morse, James Morses son, and Hector Elizondo as Bernard Thompson, the manager of the<BR>hotel.<BR> The music in this motion picture is found on the Pretty Woman Soundtrack.  It includes Natalie Cole - Wild Women Do, David Bowie - Fame 90, Roxette - Must Have Been Love, Christopher Otcasek - Real Wild Child (Wild One), and probley the most popular song that relates to this movie is Roy<BR>Orbison - Oh, Pretty Woman.<BR> I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, romantic, or movies where opposites find one another.  This movie will stick around for generations to come. I would give this movie five gold stars and two thumbs up.
B000003TAR|5.0|This is one of the darkest albums of the 90's. I always like Curt Cobain for being kinda the Lou Reed of the Nineties, while being 100 times darker. There's something really sick in this, check out Heart Shaped NBox if you don't agree, well anyway, if you like Nirvana that isn't 100% derivivitive of the Pixies,...
0792156684|5.0|I live in Europe where bashing over-the-top Hollywood movies is an art form, but I've always stood up for &quot;Titanic&quot;.  It's an astonishingly good looking movie, for one thing - when a director spends $200 million, you expect good, and boy, do we get good here.  You don't ever realize that the sinking scene takes an entire 45 minutes, it's that well paced.  The love story is beautifully done, Gloria Stuart is fabulous as the 101-year-old lady, and let's face it - I sure ain't the only one who hopes that someday someone will look at me the way Leonardo DiCaprio looked at Kate Winslett from the top of that damn staircase.  Yeah, this isn't Ingmar Bergman.  Good.  Very good that it's not.
0465011012|5.0|I think that it is a real shame that more people are not reading this book.  I just stumbled upon it and was very moved. Although we take for granted that countries like North Korea treat their citizens poorly, it is something else to get a first hand account of someone whose life was changed dramatically by his families decision to return to North Korea and his own decision to flee the country. It is an amazing story!
B000002HH9|2.0|I am a diehard cure fan from way back. I would have to say my favorite cure album is a toss up between Head on the Door, or Seventeen Seconds. Perhaps that is my problem. I like the dark and moody cure. I like Goth music, and the Cure is what I call &quot;Goth Light.&quot; I found &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; disturbingly bright, and not too good musically. I get through about the fourth song, and have to remove the offensive object from my cd player lest I burst into flames. If you really like the cure's other albums, and darker music in general, (I am listening to Fields of the Nephilim as I write this review), steer away from this album.
B00003CXTF|2.0|You won't be watching this one in Mr. Smith's History class. The only historically accurate part of this movie was that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. I'm even surprised they got that right in this film. The fact that I'm a huge WWII History buff makes this movie almost completely useless from a history point of view. Hollywood defiantly worked their charm on this one. Anyway, there were some good scenes during the raid if you fast-forward an hour and a half to get to them so you can miss all the chick flick stuff. I did like the tie-in between Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid even though they had nothing to do with each other and none of the pilots from Pearl even flew in it. (Another big history issue) Over all though, it had some really nice special effect during the raid. So if you're into good war special effects there are about 45 minutes to an hour of that good stuff.
0380789019|5.0|Excellent read.  Great romp through London Below with a normal person, rather than the normal fantasy hero.  I would recommend this book to anyone, as it definitely keeps you turning the pages.
0385505833|5.0|Once again John Grisham makes us all take a long look at how we behave during the holiday season.  If you're expecting the in depth character and plot development or the gripping drama that Grisham is famous for, you may be disappointed.  This ia a very light hearted look at how foolish we can become when we get all wrapped up in the holiday rush.  I laughed until it hurt at the sight of Luther hanging from the roof by the extension cord.  I've loaned this to several friends.  We all agree that this is a must read for Christmas.  Skipping Christmas is a quick, easy read that will make you laugh and cry at the same time.  Well done Mr. Grisham!  LOVED IT!
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is a book that brought tears to my eyes, once i got into it, i just couldn't stop reading it. The reason i rated it with five stars is because it was a book that shown a lot of sense of feeling when you start getting into the pages. Espically for fifteen year olds like me.
B000001Y79|5.0|This CD is awesome, Gwen is an awesome singer and her mates are pretty good too, I think that if you like ska-rock-pop-funk you should buy this CD
B000001FRY|4.0|&quot;Boy&quot; is of course, the album that started it all for U2.  It is a raw sampling from the band when they first hit the music scene.  If you really want to get a sense of what this Irish band sounded like back in the early 1980s, this is the album to buy.  We are talking vintage, Dublin U2.<br />Overall, the album is good, but not quite great.  Greatness would not come for the band until they released &quot;War&quot;.  Overall, the music is excellent, and you can tell that Bono is just starting to find his voice and lyrics.  As far as the songs go, I like about half of them.  The best ones are &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, &quot;A Day Without Me&quot;, &quot;Electric Co,&quot;, and &quot;Stories for Boys&quot;.  Edge's guitar playing really comes out on all of these songs.  The other songs are all pretty good, but nothing worth remembering, based on the fact that U2s best music was a few years down the road.<br />I recommend this album to any U2 fan who does not own it.  If you want to gain an appreciation of the band's musical journey, this is the starting point.  If you are not a big U2, I would not recommend this album, unless you are looking for early 1980s albums which helped change the rock scene, and put alternative (known as new wave back then) on the map.
B000002WYT|5.0|The Dave Matthews Band has wowed audiences for the past 10 years, from their days playing at Trax in Charlottesville, VA, to selling out venues such as Giants Stadium and Foxboro Stadium. &quot;Crash&quot; is my personal favorite DMB album, simply because of all the beautiful concert songs it has on it. I, being the less concert friendly, more jammed out DMB fan (meaning older stuff before newer), this song is the absolute perfect DMB album. With such concert friendly songs as &quot;So Much To Say&quot; and &quot;Too Much&quot; (Preferably &quot;SMTS -&gt; ASTB? -&gt; Too Much&quot;), &quot;#41&quot;, one of the loveliest ballads Dave has ever written, &quot;Two Step&quot;, quoted by Dave himself as their favorite song to play live, &quot;Drive In Drive Out&quot;, &quot;Lie In Our Graves&quot;, Boyd's time to shine, and &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, Leroi and Carter's time to shine. These songs are the songs that make the Dave Matthews Band shows so incredible. If you are just getting into the Dave Matthews Band, this is essentially the first album you want to buy (if you're going for a studio album). You will not be displeased.
B00005A46T|5.0|Personally I believe that this is a great album. If you like the first album this one is definitely worth getting. But as for mister Aaron Blight who apparently believes hanson is a great band, I think he should stick to reviewing his own type of music. If you dont listen to this kind of music you have no buisness telling other people whether or not it is worth buying. So if you have never heard slipknot then I suggest you listen to it before buying so that you dont waste other people's time with useless reviews like Aaron's.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Story seemed more to revolve around the love triangle than what actually happened. Yes, it was horrifying to really have it hit you in the face but, on the other hand, what we saw of what the US did in return didn't seem as devastating as the H-bombs we threw on them....or did that later...and not shown?? Tell it like it is!!!
0345440757|5.0|As a second time parent, I highly recommend this book to all up and coming parents!! She has fabulous ideas that work well for baby and parent. I see a tremendous positive difference in our second child being on Tracy's EASY plan. Also, her plan makes for a calmer more rested and more content baby, which makes for a more relaxed time for parents. This is the BEST baby book I have ever encountered, and I recommend it to all my patients who are expecting.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|When i first heard about this i thought that these guys would never defeat Disneys Toy story or toy story 2.<BR>Boy was i wrong.<BR>This film is one of the best of the year and this dvd does this great film justice.<BR>Theres a great extended ending where the characters sing some well known songs.<BR>The sound quality on this dvd is great and if you have good surround sound you will be very impressed.<BR>My favourite parts in this film are the gingerbread man interrogation scene and most of the bits where the shrek and the donkey are together.<BR>I cant possibly reccomend this dvd enough so just buy it.
0385505833|1.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books.  That is the only reason I would give anyone else to read this one.  Luckily it was short and a very easy read.<br />I did not find it entertaining, fun, interesting, or anything else.  In fact, I was going to buy it for a friend who is a Grisham fan.  Was is the operative word.<br />I have not given up on Grisham, I will read his next book.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I was hoping to get the godfathers on dvd one day and when this set came out,i knew that i had to have it.<BR>I would have to say that this dvd collection is worth every cent.<BR>The godfather films have never looked this good before.<BR>I would have bought this set even if it had no special features.<BR>Luckily the guys who put this together made this collection very good.<BR>it has many discs and extras on it.<BR>The overall design of the box the discs come in is very good for this special edition collection.<BR>BUY THIS,YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!!!!
B000003BF4|5.0|The best live Stones album, there is none more better. Nuff said.
1586210661|5.0|Last Christmas I was given, at my request, the David Sedaris boxed set. Eleven months later, I still listen to at least four stories a week. I adore him! He's wondrously, riotously funny, but he's more than that. <br />Part of what makes him so attractive to me is that I too am from a Northern family that moved South when I was a kid, and like Sedaris I moved to France because of a relationship and without knowing more than a few words of the language. But Sedaris is so engaging a narrator that his readers can identify with even his more bizarre experiences/tendencies (e.g., cleaning the apartment of a sadomasochist, his inglorious career as a performance artist, his wish to buy a two-headed calf's skull for &quot;the price of a single-seater&quot;). His vision of the world is ultimately quite tender--this comes out especially in his stories about his mother--and he never laughs at anyone more than he laughs at himself.<br />&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is a great introduction to his work, and I especially recommend the spoken version--his reading of his stories adds quite a lot to them. If the France thing particularly interests you, begin with &quot;See You Again Yesterday&quot; (live), &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; (EXCELLENT closing line!), or &quot;Picka Pocketoni&quot; (every time I hear it I can't help but wonder if Martin from California realizes how his boneheadedness has been immortalized).
B00005RFQ5|1.0|Prince has been one of those few artists that is so incredibly talented, I'd buy his stuff without even hearing it.  I mean, he IS a musical genius.   Unfortunately, he seamed to lose it after the &quot;Gold&quot; experience CD.  It's been all downhill from there, and I've still been buying them, just knowing he was going to re-capture his magic. He's too talented not to, right?...   I'm tired of waiting for it, and this is the LAST CD I will buy of his without hearing it first.  Even if you're a HUGE Prince enthusiast, DON'T pick up this CD without hearing it first.  I can usually find something on a Prince CD to admire, but this CD is completely devoid of anything worth complimenting.  Sure, he's a super talented musician and the musicianship is superb, but the songs are just excuses to be punched in the face by the message he's preaching, over and over...and over.<br />If you want to listen to this type of jazz-fusion, you'd be better off picking up a Miles Davis CD or even the classic Dave Brubeck 'Time Out.&quot;   Prince has lost me...
0789423952|5.0|There are a lot of knot books out there, and this is one of the best.  It also contains information on splicing ropes, which is suprisingly absent from about 90% of the other knot books out there.
B00005JK93|5.0|This has been my favorite movie of the year thus far! I thought the premise of the film was ridiculous but once the film gets its hooks on you, you can't let go of it. I saw the last showing for the night and I was bitterly disappointed that the record stores were closed because it's one of those movies that you just have to get the soundtrack!  Filled with drama, poignant comedy and witty dialogue, I came out of this movie with pure joy.  This is the reason why I am a movie lover.  After sitting through a lot of mediocre films this year, it is movies like Hedwig that give me affirmation.  Unfortunately, I don't think this will receive the accolades that it deserves come awards season but it deserves to be up there with the best of them.  Don't watch this movie unless you're willing to be infected with great joy, catchy songs, and great dialogues that you'll be quoting for a long time.  I can't wait until the dvd comes out on Dec. 11!!
B00005O5CM|3.0|Legally Blonde is not particularly complex, but is perfect escapism movie to get your mind off things and relax.<br />The message here is &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot;.  And we could all use a lesson in that.  The outer shell is never the entire story when it comes to each individual person.  Not only is REESE WITHERSPOON'S character an example of that, but everyone in the movie is.  That's the best part about Legally Blonde.  Reese's character is not what she appears to be on the surface and the producers don't stop there.  Some characters are what they appear, and some surprise you.<br />Although Legally Blonde isn't much better than average when it comes to movies, it does make its point in a fun and entertaining way.
014028009X|2.0|I saw the movie before I read the book. I didn't care for the movie. But everybody always seems to think that the books are better than the movies. So I read the book and was disappointed. I thought it was very slow and repetitive. Some scenes were over the top, like Bridget's mother and Julio. I am going to read the sequel since I already have the book. But this isn't a book I would recommend. I didn't bring me any emotion...I didn't laugh, I didn't cry...I just got bored and wanted to finish it.
B000050FEN|5.0|I would never dream of comparing anyone to Alfred Hitchcock.  But, David Fincher, comes damn close.  They have a lot of similarities, but the biggest one that I see is the desire to be precise and perfect.<br />Seven is Fincher's second movie!  His first being an underrated Alien 3.  In his second effort, Fincher crafted, what I think, to be the best suspense/thriller in thirty-years.  Unique.  Gut churning.  Awesomely acted.  Every shot compliments the next.  Every shot is perfect.  The sound track was perfectly thought out.  Like Hitchcock... the script was well-fleshed out, everything was perfect BEFORE HAND, and everything was perfect afterward.<br />In a sess-pool of cookie-cutter &quot;yes&quot; men that are succeeding in the movie business, Fincher emerged and did it his way.  Thankfully, he continues to do it his way.  Following &quot;Seven&quot;, he continued to do masterful work with well-written movies like &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  &quot;The Panic Room&quot; is coming out soon and I can't wait.<br />It isn't quantity that counts... it's quality.  Fincher takes his time and makes sure it's done RIGHT.<br />SEVEN.... I think, was and is one the most underrated movies ever.  It will be a classic and is one the best movies ever made.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Slow down!!  Set things up.  Introduce.  This movie was edited so tightly it ruins it!  Every scene jumps you immediately to the plot point and it garners no other reaction, but \\"Okay?\\"<br />The action sequences are fantastic.  The effects are great.  The movements that Angelina did to mimic the video game are right on.  In fact, the performances are far better than the norm for an action movie.  Yet, the story they were given to work with is cookie cutter (...).  It's almost as if the movie was planned, cast, settings were secured, effects and computers were planned and then they went \\"Okay... who's writing the script?\\"<br />Action movies these days [are bad]... and for no other reason than this.  THE SCRIPT SHOULD ALWAYS COMES FIRST!!  Once you have a story, then plan your special effects and computer graphics around it!  And only use them if you need them.  That isn't the way it happens, and that obviously isn't the way it happened here.<br />If there's a sequel... and I can't imagine that there wouldn't be... more MYSTERY and more TWISTS!!!  Don't make Indiana Jones, but remember why that movie will always be a classic.  THEY WROTE A KILLER SCRIPT!
B00000255F|5.0|This is Bruce Springsteen's best album (or CD in the case of you youngsters). If you like high-quality &quot;rock and roll&quot; that expounds on the emotions of street racing, first love, and the challenges of growing up, then stop wasting your time and buy this CD!<br />  I'm perusing this album as I write, and it brings to memory the first time I saw Bruce in concert in Portland, Oregon. He was amazing. Few other performers match his charisma and talent. Those of you who've experienced Bruce know what I mean, but then again, you already own Born To Run, know what a muscle car is, are not a virgin, and are just buying the CD.<br />  For the rest of you who haven't been sucked in by hip-hop, pop, or some other form of music that provides income to the record companies at the expense of quality to the listener, just give this piece a try, and flex some new brain cells. You'll probably love it. Classics always survive the test of time.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is Tool at its best... with songs like Stinkfist this cd is a must have for any collect and there is no other word to describe it besides Spiritual.
0792839625|1.0|Extremely uninspired film adaptation of the entertaining but largely plotless stage success about dancers auditioning for a place in the chorus line.  Music is much the same, but the energy is zero and the show doesn't really translate well to film.  Give it a miss.
B000000OE7|5.0|It's amazing that 3 guys could go into the studio without  freddie, with a few songs not considered good enough to be included on their two previous albums and with several bits and pieces of songs recorded just before freddies death and come out with something so beautiful and solid. Most amazing is how freddie mercury continued to record practically untill his death and sing so well. <br />Almost all these songs seem to fit a theme. While the tone is melancholy each song always leaves room for hope. Very powerful for a rock band that usually was intent on writing songs that were more humorous and fun. &quot;It's a beautiful day&quot; sets things off and it doesn't take much imagination to understand what &quot;let me live&quot; is about. &quot;Mother love&quot; is particularly moving. A song apparently referring to freddie's life long friendship with mary austin. This was the last song freddie recorded a song that denotes true friendship because he didn't live to finish it but his friends do finish it. Brian adds the finishing vocals to one of queens best songs ever.  &quot;Heaven for everyone&quot; denotes queens catholic mentality and &quot;a winters tale&quot; is very very beautiful. &quot;Too much love will kill you&quot; is a good song that brian wrote some time before and sang solo at the tribute concert. <br />No this isn't the best queen album for those who want to rock and hear fantastic guitar flourishes or complex cord changes. It's peaceful, melodic and quite an exellent eulogy to a fine friend and great artist. I'm glad queen made this album and i do consider it essential for true fans. The message is to live each day to the fullest and never give up regardless of how difficult the circumstances. <br />........................socks
0425129616|3.0|Christie's first published novel is clunky and over-worked, but it has two things going for it: it introduces Poriot and it clearly demonstrates Christie's talent for creating a complex plot with an unexpected resolution.  In the years to come, Christie will write a great many better novels than STYLES, but it is a solid start to a brilliant career. Christie fans will enjoy the book; others, however, may find it dated and wordy.
B00000055E|2.0|This is a bad 2pac album.  Do 4 love is the only good song.  There might be one or two others that are salvageable, but if you don't already have this CD, don't rush out and buy.  Don't mistakenly think it will make a good X-mas gift for someone.  They will be thouroughly disappointed.

6304711875|5.0|This movie, as a subtle parody of typical horror movies, while still being one itself is very amusing, and makes it worth to watch more than once or twice.<br />All actors &amp; actresses were great in this movie. I couldn't imagine anyone but David Arquette as the childish deputy Dewey Riley, who tries very hard to appear like a professional cop, but his 'boyish good looks' and his younger sister continously get in his way... Drew Barrimore is amazing as the terrified Casey, who innocently chats with the murderer about horror movies, until she realizes what is going on... But the most amazing (and I mean it!) performance of the movie is Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis. He just moves so smoothly between the innocent guy, who is wrongly accused (the way he looks at Sidney in the police station, like he's going to start crying any second) to the 'bad boy' look with the 'evil' shine in his eyes when Stu and him are scaring Randy at the video store, or in the final scenes when they're chasing Sidney around. He's just an amazing actor!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I am so glad I decided to hold off on buying the first Almost Famous DVD, finally the moment has arrived when the film is worth buying. The extra features on this DVD make this a must own for anyone who loved, or even enjoyed this film. The 30 minutes added to the overall film really help out the movie as a whole. I always felt the last act of the movie happens to quickly and things kind of got cut away too soon. Not anymore. The movie feels more complete. Some scenes in the theatrical version of the movie are expanded here, and they really add something new to overall feel of the scene. I was afraid that the extra 30 mins, were just some ploy by the studio to slip in a few outtakes or worthless scenes, but that isn't the case.<br />The commentary track on this film is truly one of the best and most enjoyable DVD commentaries out there. It's shamelessly personal and filled with interesting insights by director Cameron Crowe.  <br />The 6 song Stillwater cd is a great touch. It really makes Stillwater feel like they were the real thing, and the songs are great!<br />The rest of the features are not exactly things that will blow you away, but they're fun to look at and nice to own. For example, the Cleveland concert from Stillwater. The Rolling Stone artciles written by Mr. Crowe give you a sense of what William Miller articles must have looked like.<br />&quot;The stairway to heaven&quot; on disc 2 might be a little too much for some people. Those who love the song (myself included) and the idea Cameron Crowe was trying to get across in the scene, will find the scene very enjoyable to watch. <br />I recommend this DVD to everyone who loved the theatrical version. If you haven't seen the movie, then WATCH THIS VERSION AND NOT THE THEATRICAL! It's all happening on this DVD :).

B00005RFQ5|2.0|Since &quot;Purple Rain&quot; I have been a Prince fan, and have always been hopeful that each subsequent release would keep me entertained and engaged in his music. Sadly, I have to say that much of what was released after The Revolution broke up doesn't hit the mark (with the exception of a few jewels here and there). Yet I still purchase the albums praying that the magic will return.<br />&quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; does not deliver, either. Yes, there are some bright spots - however as many other reviewers noted, the overbearing, over-used, and overtly-religious spoken 'voice' throughout the record kills it.<br />I am likely to continue to hang on to my hopes and buy Prince records... but as the years and albums go by, my hopes dim more and more.
B000002C1V|1.0|Granted Roger has some great ideas and fantastic lyrics througout Floyd's career, but I can do without this depressing, grating, sonic misadventure.  I totally enjoy most that is Floyd, but this one is the worst.  As uneven as &quot;Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; is, at least there are musical parts on that one which is pleasing to listen to. Not so on &quot;The Final Cut&quot;.  I have friends who love this album, but it is beyond me as to why. If you liked &quot;Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking&quot; then by all means, indulge in &quot;Cut&quot;. I'll stick with the true Floyd albums.  Funky Dung this ain't.
0064407667|5.0|I really wasn't sure that I was going to like this book at all, but my friends all said I had to read the series!  So I trudged to the bookstore and bought _The Bad Beginning_ (read the title with a dark, raspy voice--it makes me laugh).  I didn't really love the series until I read the second and subsequent books, but they truly are delightful!  Yes, they're rather dark and somewhat morbid, but they're also funny and lighthearted at times.  The wonderful relationship the three Baudelaire children have with each other is something I'd like to see more often in siblings.  They work together, and they apologize when they say mean things unintentionally.  And they're smart, to boot!  No longer is there a stigma attached to smart children who enjoy reading or inventing or biting things!  No one else sees these hobbies as unsual or abnormal, so the reader doesn't either.  I especially like how Mr. Snicket defines words that most children will understand (though the definitions are excellent if the reader doesn't know what the word means), yet he leaves even more complicated words untouched.  The idea leaves me reaching for my dictionary every once in a while.  <BR>For me, the books only take about an hour to read, so they're a brief respites from classes and exams even while I only have a short break!<BR>I truly wish I could make this review separate from the series as a whole, but I'm afraid I can't--the books just go together.  <BR>I don't feel that the plot is overly dark, but I'm also not 10 years old.  I can see quite plainly what is happening, and I can understand without being told that the circumstances have nothing to do with reality as it pertains to me.  For me, the point is NOT that the Baudelaire Orphans are being chased by an evil, treacherous villian--the point is that the children are intelligent, witty, and are using their resources to overcome the obstacles in their path.  Consider, Sunny teaches herself how to speak!  The Series of Unfortunate Events is an excellent series!

B00005NKKZ|5.0|Ones push it into all-time five star territory. I bought this album when it came out a generation ago,knowing even then that the TITLE TRACK was surely among the most beautiful ballads ever recorded, and an original at that! Now, maybe a little wizened,but surely much more knowledgable of the whole vast history of song recordings, I know this song was no fluke. It is worth the album on it's own.&quot; El Condor&quot; is a nice variation on an old Spanish melody,and holds up nicely too. &quot;Cecilia&quot; is barely above &quot;trash&quot; level, and sounds as bad as ever. At least &quot;Keep the Customer&quot; and &quot;Baby Driver&quot; have a sense of humor, even if they're on the same level as,say,  Hermit's Hermits. &quot;The Boxer&quot; sounds as good as ever,and the story it tells is true as ever,plus shows them doing their best harmonies together. &quot;Only Living Boy&quot; I liked alot back then,though it's charm today surely does not go much past Senior High School,when I first heard it. &quot;Why Don't You Write Me&quot; is in the same goofball league as &quot;Keep..&quot; and &quot;Baby Driver&quot;...&quot;By By Love&quot; strictly for Buddy Holly fans. &quot;So Long Frank Lloyd&quot; must be among the most under-rated gems of the era, a beautiful homage for the architect,where S &amp; G, probably the hottest youth act in the nation in 1970, admit even a great architect can outdo them.&quot;When I run dry,I stop awhile and think of you.&quot;  And the final &quot;Song for the Asking&quot; is a perfect closer...All in all, a monument to song writing,and recording,despite the inclusion of some silly trifles...HOWEVER, BOOKENDS may be better.Buy them both...The rest by this duo is several cuts below these two classics.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Hearing John Mayer was an absolute breath of fresh air for me. As a fan still mourning the dissolution of Ben Folds Five, I am so glad that John Mayer has been able to fill the void very nicely. If Dave Matthews, Duncan Sheik, and BFF had a son who was greater than the sum of his parts, it would be John Mayer. Room for Squares is one of the most enjoyable CDs I have heard in a long time. This is the work of a consummate musician who doesn't take himself too seriously. A Must Buy!
B0000024SD|3.0|Yes, I know the story. I was &quot;there&quot; in the late 60's,played guitar, the whole nine yards. There are only two songs here that I can listen to, more than once, in a row. &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot;,and &quot;Love Minus Zero&quot;, which both show Bob's unique talents (maybe &quot;genius&quot;, though that is a much overstretched term .) Nice melodies, even if close copies of stuff done in the 30's -40's,like a lot of Bob's things. His singing is even fair here,at least not the equivalent of the old nails on the chalk board. The praise for &quot;Subterraneum Homesick Blues&quot; runs to no end,it's lyrics even called a capsule of the Amercan Century. Well, it does have some of Bob's early oddball humor,which makes for much of the charm in his earliest pieces. Beyond that,basic simple blues and his vocal here is in the &quot;chalkboard&quot; category. Ditto for &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot; though it is hilarious,something so rare in rock that Bob almost had it patented. &quot;Tamborine Man&quot; needed the Byrds' version. Otherwise, it would have been another rambling song about who knows what. Truly, his voice here reaches an all-time bottom.His dream numbers are always funny,even to this day.I play them sometimes simply for the sheer amusement. &quot;It's Allright /Ma&quot;  is interesting,and a very powerful solo (with no blaring amplification) number. The words are clearly sung and the whole enterprise does seem one a kind...But let's face it,there were plenty of simply bad songs that Bob did,along with some very interesting ones.

This album shows her growth and maturity in the business and I'm sure that many fans would agree.

B00005LKIM|1.0|When this movie came out I just knew I had to watch it. I expected to see a thriller that would make me have nightmares for days. What I saw was pure crap.<BR>This just doesn't make any sense AT ALL. Wild boars? Give me a break, that is just so absurd and pointless. It's just like the old and boring Batman TV series in which the villains tried to kill Batman with the most bizarre and stupid methods. I just laughed during the entire movie.<BR>The only thing I liked? The brain thing. It actually sucked but hey, after an hour and a half of crap any change is good.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|i'll tell you right now i didn't pay for this album so i don't know if it's &quot;worth the money&quot; but i will tell you this i didn't care that it's not exactly like their other stuff which sounds like mostly run a the mill bad religion ,pennywise , . or that it plays on a beatles song ,what band in the entire universe wasn't at some point touched by the beatles . some people are such cry babies over musical integrity . it's a good album and it doesn't particularly hurt the ears . its just music that all .
B000053V7Q|2.0|I just can't help disbelieving that this new version leaves out &quot;I Just Can't Help Believing&quot; the opening track and greatest song on the &quot;That's the Way It Is&quot; album. I also just can't help disbelieving the way this film butchers the original version as if there was nothing worth while in it except the music! This DVD is a great COMPANION PIECE to the original documentary, but a far LESSER FILM. In fact, it's NOT a film at all! Watching this is like sitting in a room with a person with attention deficit disorder who keeps fast-forwarding a documentary to all the music scenes he likes, letting it play for a while, and fast-forwarding again. Don't get me wrong I LOVE the additional music footage, but why couldn't they just add it to the original film, and leave the film in tact? The original documentary (and I didn't say Music Video) gets FIVE stars. This release gets docked three stars for playing to the M-TV culture of slam-bang action and instant gratification and removing the fascinating context of the original film. Inexcusable and disappointing.
6301790170|5.0|Yes, it's true.  I enjoyed this film more than I did &quot;Wages of Fear&quot;.  I think it's much more suspenseful, for one thing, especially the rickety bridge scene.  That was some incredible movie making.
B00004XONN|5.0|I can't review this CD based on previous Radiohead albums, since this is the first Radiohead CD I've purchased, though I plan to look into more of their stuff in the future. Until a few months ago I hadn't heard anything of Radiohead besides &quot;Creep&quot; on the radio, which didn't impress me so I figured all the talk about Radiohead was just hype. But when I heard the controversy about Kid A, and found out that one of my friends had it, I had to see for myself. Even though most people here say that they hated it the first time, I actually liked it (even though I didn't get some of the songs), and it got better with each listen. <br />   The strength of this album -- and the reason so many people hate it -- is that it is almost completely electronic, with Thom Yorke's voice just fading in and out, sometimes hardly understandable. I think of it as classical music for the electronic music age; the moods and ideas are built with the sound more than anything else. It's kind of like I always thought &quot;space-age&quot; music would sound when I was a kid, and that futuristic mood works with the theme of Kid A. <br />   Another thing is that even though someone (maybe Thom himself) described Kid A as &quot;emotionless,&quot; I thought it was extremely emotional, such as the melancholy &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; and the confusion of &quot;Idioteque.&quot; Beside all its artistic merit, it's good listening for when you're depressed.

6302794331|5.0|This movie is THE BEST version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; I have ever seen. It is very entertaining for both children and grown ups. Even the little ones can watch this one, as the ghosts aren't so spooky that they will have nightmares. The Christmas message of giving, etc. shines very clear and anyone who watches it will be left smiling and singing.
B00001ZULV|4.0|This is a decent compilation for people interested in the music from the &quot;pop-rock&quot; phase of the group.  Of course, Genesis was never as pop-y as some have made them out to be, and songs like &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Domino&quot; on the Invisible Touch album attest to this fact.  Also it should be noted that for all the talk about Gabriel and Collins eras, the major musical force behind Genesis was almost always Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford.<BR>  Unfortunately, the track selection of this album could be better.  There seems to be too many tracks from &quot;We can't dance,&quot; while better pop songs such as &quot;No Reply at All&quot; and &quot;That's all&quot; were left off.  Personally, I would have also added more older songs such as &quot;Afterglow,&quot; and &quot;Ripples.&quot;  These songs are pretty melodic and could have served to introduce more people to early Genesis.
0380002930|5.0|There are not many books that if you said were about bunnies that you would want to read.  This is that one you would want to read.  Watership Down, by Richard Adam, is an excellent work of fiction that draws the reader into the novel and leaves the reader guessing throughout the novel.  I would recommended this book to everyone I know, for it is memorable and unforgettable.<BR> Richard Adam writes through the eyes of wild rabbits, which leave home on the pretense of the main character's brother's, Fiver, ability to sense danger in the near future.  The story travels with a band of smaller, weaker, male rabbits that do not know the first thing of creating a colony.  Adam Tries to foreshadow most events within the story and uses the characters and events as a microcosm.  Throughout the book many themes seem to appear, but the overwhelming theme that is constant in the novel is the overcoming of good over evil and the will that people have to push forward.<BR> As a memorable book there are always memorable ideas and enigmas that seem to dawn on a person, and these occurrences is what makes a memorable novel or story.  One of the most memorable parts of the novel is how these rabbits overcome the impossible and defeat their fears and hardships.  Another memorable theme of the novel is the loyalty that these rabbits exhibit throughout the novel.  The loyalty shone between brothers and those who were once enemies are all displayed through the novel.  The microcosm of the novel is one of World War II and the presence of evil lurking.  This is evident with a character in the story that is very self-righteous and selfish, which combats the characteristics of the antagonist.  <BR> The struggles of man between choosing good and evil and those who are pulling you in to conformity, which are addressed in this novel, will be images imprinted on your mind forever.    Through the experiences of the characters in this novel one may see the faults of society that the author tries tobring to light to his reader and his implications of leadership and loyalty expressed by his characters are things that we should learn, and for this I would recommend this book to all.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I have had this cd for about three weeks now [never mind how] and I can honestly say that I am still listening to it. Don't know what that is worth but take it. I don't see a point to that intro, Hella good is a GREAT song, making out is up there too, and I like Don't let me down. Now these songs are all bouncy and fun to listen to, I think they did a good job. The reason I give it four stars is because I feel the tunes themselves could have been better. But it does grow on you! :)
B00005R23S|5.0|I attended the Houston concert, and was impressed by how well the band sounded (I was suspicious they might have been going through the motions for another large payday). This DVD captures the concert sound very well, it sounds better than the CD version. Some songs seem to jump out &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot; (hardly in most people's top 10) is outstanding. The Darkness songs such as &quot;Badlands and &quot;Darkness on the edge of town&quot; are impressive; dark and majestic. <BR>Just think, this may be the last tour the E Street band ever do together. This DVD will help us remember.
B00005JKES|5.0|Way back during Melrose Place's popularity Kimberly Shaw bombed the apartment complex. In Entertainment Weekly they talked about how Kimberly's troubled alter-ego, Henry. Hidden in mirrors, taunting her to harm the tennants he was the show's Twin Peaks man....Twin Peaks? I knew growing up I had heard of the show, but what kind of show was this???? I soon found myself researching the show on the internet a few months later and eventually was able to obtain a copy of the pilot episode. The problem is that I soon learned this wasn't the televised &quot;Who Killed Laura Palmer?&quot; version (luckily I've since learned the original ending), but it included the &quot;European Ending&quot;....<br />The episode was realllllly intriguing. It wasn't like anything I had ever seen on TV, prior to and since that first viewing. It had all the elements - comedy, action, soap opera, mystery, drama, and partly hypnotic suspense...The story revolved around the aforementioned question, &quot;Who killed Laura Palmer?&quot; The high school prom queen was discovered &quot;wrapped in plastic&quot; and soon the family and friends were told by the local sheriff, wonderfully named, Harry S. Truman. The emotion depicted remains the most realistic I have ever seen and I constantly get chills every time I watch those opening scenes. Soon we met an FBI agent who is brought into the case as the mystery starts to unravel. By the way - the MYSTERY was what made this first season, but ABC forced Mark Frost, and creator, David Lynch to reveal the killer after many long, long months of audience torture...<br />And here's the thing - the show is aptly named for its many annoyingly similiar looking actors and actresses, and its first season peak, which some will say quickly jumped the shark by the season finale. But as you watch, the music pulls you in, the fashion adds a bizzare touch - unmistakenly 50's in style, and then you have the odd humor and supernatural happenings. That's what this show was about.<br />Sadly, the pilot episode is not included in the first season box set, because Artisan couldn't obtain the rights (but it is sold separately and can easily be found on DVD on eBay). However this shouldn't be disappointing to those who own the tapes already as it remained separate as well. I eventually found the prequel movie. The prequel follows Laura Palmer in her final week and reveals the killer. While this kind of viewing isn't reccommended (the killer isn't exposed until the second season) I had researched the show enough to have already discovered this crucial fact.<br />Finally after saving up enough money I was able to buy the box set, including the first and second season. And WOW! This show is and was absolutely the best thing I have ever witnessed. What other show has a midget, a giant, a demon, a one-armed man, a log lady, dopplegangers, alternate universes, deadly chess games, and can still be based in a reality we can relate to, just twisted enough to be seen in a darker light? I'm telling you - this is the DVD of DVDs! So grab yourself some cherry pie and a cup of coffee and sit back and discover for yourself: &quot;Who Killed Laura Palmer?&quot;
0440219078|4.0|The book that I am doing is called &quot;The Giver&quot;.  It is about a boy name Jonas who turned twelve and became a receiver.  During his time of life, people of each age would have a community service which they would become something.  For example- Jonas turned twelve and became a receiver which he gets to tell lies.  He doesn't tell lies to anyone before.  Then Jonas had met a guy who he calls himself The Giver.  The Giver gave Jonas memories and thoughts.          <br />   I think the book &quot;The Giver&quot; is a pretty good book, but some of the parts I don't understand that makes me confuse in the beginning.  Once I keep reading it until I got to the middle of the book, it was starting to get into me.  It has really touching details and it is like I am part of the book.  It was like I was Jonas of his point of view.  This author name Lois Lowry is a great writer to create this great book.  I think that the book, &quot;The Giver&quot; is a great book that everyone might enjoy.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Much thanks to Max Martin, who wrote almost all of the songs for her.  I actually like Britney Spears' music, but it is really the folks behind Britney that make this happen.  The only song she helped out with (she gave them the idea, they wrote the song), is a weak prayer for what she can do.  She giggles with her friends in between songs about a boy that is looking at her, but she is scared to talk to him.  Give me a break.  It's embarrassing to listen to this one. Britney doesn't have much talent, but she does look good!

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is a pure delight. The acting, especially Guy Pearce (who plays the main character-Lenny) is topnotch. The story is told in reverse and if you like a mystery with a challenging way of figuring out whodunit this is it! I have never been more intrigued with a movie. It's so different! Kudos to the director, screenwriter and actors for having the guts to bring such a mind boggling, one of a kind movie like &quot;Memento&quot; and not bowing down to the pressure to churn out the same old garbage Hollywoods chugs out yearly. Thank you-Chrisopher Nolan! You deserve an Oscar for best screenplay! Guy Pearce should definitely rate a nod for Best Actor too.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|One of Bjork's most haunting pieces of music. I love the music but i get chills listening to it.<BR>A great album, complete, touching with its rich instrumentation and everyday sounds (did you ever think it possible that the sound of a train on the tracks would be the rhythmic backbone of a song?)<BR>As troubling and profound as the movie.
B00003CXTG|2.0|First of all, this movie does not have a good storyline nor script. I have a feeling that the main characters were ripped off from some other story. And personally I think Josh Hartnett is the only one doing a decent job while the rests fall below standard.<br />Secondly, the DVD presentation is extremely disappointing. The only reason I choose to buy DVDs is to get the whole movie uninterrupted. Of course I prefer DVDs with lots of extra features. However, I feel that just because there are not enough extra features to fill up the second disc, the studio actually divided the movie into 2 parts!<br />This movie is only 3-hour-long, the same as &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot;, so I don't see any reason why the studio needs to split it into 2 discs. I must say that I'm extremely disappointed with this DVD.
0446608955|4.0|A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks, is a truly compassionate love story between two young teenagers, Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan.  This novel is a story that can make you smile, but also make you cry.<br />Landon, at age fifty-seven, is remembering the year 1958 in his hometown of Beaufort, North Carolina.  At this time, Landon is seventeen years old and living the life of a normal teenager: going to school, applying for college, hanging out with his friends at Cecil's Diner, and dating sporadically.  Landon is recalling the year in his life which changes him forever and the year which he will never forget.<br />Jamie Sullivan is also a teenager at Beaufort High School but is rather different than most other people her age.  She is the daughter of the Southern Baptist minister, Hegbert; she loves him very much and claims he fills the open void left by her mother who died in childbirth.  Jamie walks around all the time carrying her mother's bible, helps critters, and volunteers at the local orphanage.  Though she is set apart in her ways, Jamie is still a girl to which many adore and look up to.<br />Landon could never imagine where his life would lead in the next year.  It first begins with the annual homecoming dance.  Landon does not have a date due to his recent breakup with Angela Clark.  Over time, he begins to ponder on the idea of taking Jamie and eventually gets up his nerve to ask her.  She says yes and though it was an eventful night, they do have an enjoyable evening.<br />Life begins to turn back to normal for Landon until Jamie asks him to perform the lead role next to her in the annual Christmas play.  Landon knows the play is very sentimental to Jamie because it is centered around her life.  He also recognizes her appreciation and gratefulness when he agrees.<br />In the next several weeks, Jamie and Landon spend much time together rehearsing.  Finally, the time comes to perform, and the play as always is a huge success.  In spending this time together, Landon begins to view Jamie in a different way.  His attitude begins to change for her, and he begins to fear that he is falling for her.<br />Through the dance, the play, spending time with the orphans, gift giving, and just talking, their feelings for one another heighten, and eventually they acknowledge these emotions.  They both know each has fallen for the other in more ways than one.  Landon reacts and tells Jamie for the first time, \\"I love you,\\" but he does not expect what Jamie tells him in return.<br />Through the next few months, Landon and Jamie eventually learn of how strong the bond between them is when their love is truly tested.  Of course, as most love stories do, their love does stand and proves true after many devastating obstacles.  As the novel ends, the reader too discovers the power of true love and begins to view life in a totally different perspective.<br />The characters in this novel were very well rounded and delicately described.  In viewing all characters, we can devise many different characteristics and traits of each.  Sparks does a wonderful job in depicting the novel's characters.<br />The power of true love and its strength to prevail is the reoccurring theme of A Walk to Remember.  The reader sees the love between Jamie and Landon grow and eventually overcome.  Though the theme is no readily stated, the theme is obviously noted by the thickening plot.<br />As always, Nicholas Sparks creates a wonderful work of literature in writing A Walk to Remember.  Through your emotions, he creates a magnificently plausible novel of joy and hope.  I, personally, enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape and fall in love.

B00004T37H|5.0|This is the most amazing Japanese anime film I have ever seen! This movie will leave you in a state of awe long after it is over.  I am especially enchanted by the thought that the animals of the forest once had a consciousness ... that is before the Spirit of the Forest was killed.  Afterwards, the animals never speak again.  I also love the blend of real Japanese legends mixed into the plot.  Like the Kodama who mysteriously and suddenly appear only to hop around and click their heads.  Doesn't the legend about them say that they only appear to those who have an honest heart and bring good luck?  The animation is excellent, but the plot is what makes the movie.  This is a must see, but can be a bit too scary for the kids.  Although I recently gave a copy to a [...]boy who is mature for his age, I wouldn't recommend to others giving it to anyone under [..]old.  Parents should see it and then make their own judgement call.  But don't blow this off!  It is definitely worth the effort.  You will really be missing out if you don't see this film.  YOU WON'T REGRET THIS BUY.
6304493681|4.0|Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite movies.  Whether anime or not.  The plot is rich and complex, the action rather intense, etc.  Some people might be offended by the occasional nudity, just as some people might not like the 'deepness' of the plot.  To each his own.  This one makes you think.  Unlike many movies, whether anime or not.
0440213525|5.0|In the fiction novel &quot;The Client,&quot; By John Grisham, the protagoist, eleven- year-old mark Sway witnesses the bizarre suicide of a New Orleans attorney as the novel opens. Just as he dies, the lawyer tells mark of a deadly secet concerning the recent murder of a Louisiana Senator, whose accused killer, Mafia thug Barry Muldanno is about to go to trial. The police, the federal prosecutor, and the FBI pressure Mark to tell them the attorney's last words, but he knows that with the mob watching his every move, revealing his secret will surely get him killed. <BR>       Therefore Mark, streetwise beyond his years, hires a lawyer: Reggie Love, whose been through more than anyone could imagine and survived. When Mark's life is threatened, and Reggie discovers her office has been &quot;bugged,&quot; the Juvenile Court says Mark has no choice but to talk. She realizes that this time she's in way over her head. Then Mark comes up with a plan.<BR>       Mark Sway is an eleven year old genious, who is also quite foolish. This contrast of character keeps an excellent flow of the plot. John Grisham does an excellent job on Mark's character, as well as Foltrigg, the opposing stuckup, U.S. prosecuting attorney. Engoseed in his job, he really helps display the infamous view of lying, cheating and sneaky lawyers, which we all hate, yet Grisham makes it seem like he if jus ttrying to do his job. <BR>        Finally, this book was very suspenseful. One thing after another occoured, which was exciting. Although Grisham had a rushed ending it seemed. The ending could have been much better.It leaves us guessing at the fate of Mark. Some readers may enjoy this concept, while I would have liked a better ending to this action packed thriller. Overall, &quot;The Client&quot; was a rush.
B00003CXE7|2.0|This movie didn't do anything for me.  I thought the acting was 'wooden' and the plot simplistic.  I do enjoy action movies, but this one didn't fit into that category imho.  I did like a few of the fight scenes, but they weren't enought to win me over.
B000056K04|5.0|What can I say?  I love Dave Matthews Band.  And I know every song that he's ever written, from ''Seek Up'' to ''Bartender''.  And when I bought Everyday, I will tell you that was not the slightest bit upset.  I obviously expected, After hearing ''The Space Between'' on the radio and on SNL, it was very obvious that the sound of the album was going to be of that ''poppish'' nature.  But in fact, it's one of my favorite DMB albums, actually it would be my favorite if it weren't for ''Before these Crowded Streets''!  All I can say is wether your a fan or not, buy it - NOW.
0441172717|5.0|The Dune series truly is a wonderful collection of sci-fi books.  The vividness and completeness of the 'alternate reality' being portayed is staggering.  You truly are thrown into another world; given the number of books available, you can 'wallow in it' for quite some time.  If you want a break from everyday reality, dive into these books and don't surface until you need food, sleep, etc.
B00005Q4GA|2.0|Ahh, another movie build over a computer game, this one have to be good. We all still fondly remember a masterpiece like Streetfighter, that made us all dance with joy. And now comes Tombraider. A movie obviously tailored to profit from the success of the game. Angelina Jolies body is perfect cast in the role as Lara Croft, and I am sure that alot of teenage boys will agree with me on that one.<BR>The story is about Lara who is going after some artifact that have been split in two, many centuries ago so it could not be used again(one have to wonder why they did not destroy it instead of using energy on building vast underground dungeons to place it in). Whoever holds this artifact got the power to control time. Her opposition are a group of bad guys called the Illuminati, that uses all means to get to the pieces before Lara.<BR>The plot could have been taken from an old Indiana Jones script, although it is full of holes. The movie seem to take itself too seriously, and not much acting is actualy involved.<BR>Tomb Raider seems to me like a (take-off) from Indiana Jones, but where Indiana Jones often handle situations with wit and charm and elegance, Lara usualy just pull out her twin-mounted automatics and blast the obstacle to pieces, which make the movie seem alot less charming and a lot less fun. But what do you expect from a movie build over a computer game. One have to wonder about how smart this Lara girl can really be since we see her wandering around an icy Siberian plain, in only hotpants and a tight t-shirt, or earlier when marching through a muddy field in a white trench coat. But I guess even tomb-raiders have to put more emphasis on the fashion trends and less on practical details these days.<BR>The movie will most certainly be a hit, and I do admit that Jolies body looks fine in the role.
6304795254|4.0|I've enjoyed many movies by the Douglas clan over the years, and this one was no exception.  It kept me guessing until the end, and even then I needed to watch it again.  Don't let someone tell you the ending!  The whole concept being depicted was a new experience to me.  I enjoyed the acting, drama, etc.
B00005QXXO|4.0|I viewed the impending release of this album with excitement (as indeed I view all impending Radiohead releases with excitement), but nevertheless with some trepedation. A mere 8 songs, with many of my favorites from the last two albums (How To Disappear Completely, Pyramid Song, Life In A Glasshouse) left off, and some of the lesser, in my opinion songs (Like Spinning Plates, Idioteque) in their place. However, my worries were unsurped, as this is a good collection, and the songs on here that I liked least on the two studio albums are, in their new arrangements, are the highlights of it. Like Spinning Plates, which was surely on the bottom of the barrel in regards to quality of the songs on Kid A and Amnesiac, is positvely great here, with new brooding piano work and audible (!) vocals. Idioteque sounds radically different out of the album's computer/techno context, as the live working here comes complete with an incredible section featuring only Thom's bellowing vocals and Phil Selway's pounding drums. Everything In Its Right Place, also, has been extended (now at over 7 minutes) with lots of live scatting and such added in. Morning Bell has a nice rendition here as well, as is Dollars and Cents (superior to previous live version I've heard.) True Love Waits, a previously unreleased Radiohead track performed solo here by Thom Yorke, is stunning. This is one of their few songs with truly nice lyrics, and Thom offers an emotionally compelling vocal. Worth the price of the album alone for Radiohead fans. Still, not all the tracks on this album are on this level. The National Anthem had to be included on this as it was the opening song, but it is quite inferior to the studio version (it greatly misses the brass section - perhaps the reason that they didn't include Life In A Glasshouse.) I Might Be Wrong, on the other hand, is oddly aurally inferior in quality to the other songs (odd indeed, considering it's the album's title track.) These two songs, right in a row atthe start of the album, might give you an initially off-putting impression, but rest assured, the rest of the songs are better. This is an interesting, and vital, live record because it shows how Radiohead, still a great live band, took the decidely anti-performance, anti-rock, hell, anti-human songs of their last two studio albums and translated them into a live performance setting. And to good effect. Still, all this said, you have to wonder... why only 8 songs, in this format? I know this was originally planned as a sort of single for I Might Be Wrong, and then expanded, but, it seems to me, that, if you're gonna put out a live album, you might as well put out the whole 2-CD, 20-song extravaganza. I suppose they just wanted to use this as an opportunity to cap this era of their career, and not feature any older songs, but still... still. This isn't longer than some of their EPs (though, conversely, it isn't much shorter than Amnesiac, either), but hell... it doesn't even have packaging to equal some of their singles. Still, you can't argue with what's here. Any fan of Radiohead will want to pick it up.
0671027573|5.0|Contrary to a number of other reviewers, I found this book quite up to Ms. Howard's usual standards, certainly better than &quot;All the Queen's Men&quot; which, in my opinion, remains her worst recent attempt. And even that is relative as Ms. Howard's worst would be considered a good effort if written by another author. The book is quite suspenseful with a number of good love scenes thrown in. The scene where the ten point wish list is devised is hilarious although a number of others were as great (the early morning coffee scene with the free view which Jaine gets of Sam is particularly good). I did not appreciate certain characters (whom I had become fond of) being killed off but it was actually good vis-a-vis plot development.
B00005Q66T|4.0|I can understand in many ways how quite a few people have been critical of this Greatest hits collection.The main gripe seems to be that there is no new material on offer here.In my opinion though I think this is a good thing.Far too often in the recent past artists have released collections with one (or two if you're very lucky) new songs.This almost forces the dedicated fan to buy the c.d.,even though they already have 90% of the material already.So I admire Madonna or her company for not trying this trick.<BR> Ten years of work are embodied on this c.d.What a rollercoaster 10 years they have been for her.You'd have to say that her star was not exactly shining too brightly at the start of this period.Exotica was a complete flop-her flirty,coquetish songs had become dead boring at this stage.She seemed to be relying on collaborations to get a hit or to put herself in the spotlight.I was not a fan of the Evita soundtrack at all-at this stage it may have appeared that we were losing Madonna to the movie world for good.Thankfully she was a better musician then she was actress-well I suppose it wasn't that much competition.<BR> Then enter William Orbit and Mirwais-who between them have lifted Madonna from from an ever quickening downward spiral.Both of their sounds are very distinctive from a production point of view.Orbit-the crisp,highly polished Euro-dance sound.Using a synth backing and techno/dance beats they managed to create 'Ray Of Light'-which would be one of my favourite Madonna c.d.'s.This c.d. is well represented here-with ballads like Frozen and Power Of Goodbye,as well as the thumping dance beats of the albums title track.He also did Beautiful Stranger-which is a nice addition for those who didn't buy the single but who own the albums.At this stage you could see their sound moving to a more 60's psychedelia,yet still retaining a definite dance feel.<BR> Mirwais was hired for the majority of Music's key tracks.The styles are remarkably different-in that itwas easy to spot on that c.d. which were done by Orbit and which were done by Mirwais.The Frenchman seems to have a more funky,Daft Punkesque sound.Full of tricks like distorted and vocoded vocals,synth effects swirling in and out-and all of it backed by phatter beats which were heavy on the bass.I was always surprised that 'Amazing' was never released as a single as it's by far the catchiest track on the c.d.-it's also not included here.Thankfully this c.d. does not include American Pie-which was a number one in the U.K. but I think it's awful.<BR> The one thing I'm not quite sure about though on her later work is,how much of this was her producers creativity and how much was Madonna's.Orbit's work has had a very distinctive sound that has also done well for groups like All Saints-and it's identical for what's on Ray Of Light.To be honest I think this c.d. desrves between 3/4 stars.I would reccomend readers to buy her last 2 albums instead-you'll only be paying a little more,but it's much better value!

B00004XQ83|4.0|This is an interesting collection of songs. Of course, most will buy it for the Soggy Bottom Boys' &quot;I am a Man of Constant Sorrow.&quot; And just as many will be surprised to find four versions on the CD, two by the Soggy Bottom Boys, a guitar version, and a fiddle version. The version most are looking for, the one now getting air time, is the fourth version (track 16). Many will recognise several other songs, such as &quot;You Are My Sunshine.&quot; Fans of old religious music will recognize, &quot;I'll Fly Away.&quot; Other tracks include old prison songs and other music from years ago.
B00003CY5J|4.0|The Score is a big movie with prominent actors of three generations - Marlon Brando, Robert de Niro (Ha! Both of them have acted the same role in the Godfather Trilogy) versus Edward Norton of the Fight Club. Edward Norton?s performance is very outstanding, and did not really show that he is a late comer in the industry, even when he was in the same scene with Marlon and Robert. The cast's performance is unquestionable, although the story was too slow and dragging at the beginning. If you like Sneakers, Mission Impossible or Thomas Crown Affair, this would be a movie that you would like - for it is talking about how professional, high-tech and scientific stealing things could be. As a result people would prefer to have more emphasis on the planning and actual actions in the movie, and less on other side lines stuff, especially when they don?t seem really relevant to the whole plot at all. Also, Angela Bassett who acts as Robert de Niro?s girlfriend is pretty disturbing, especially with her exaggerated attempts to make herself look sexy. Urh, should have consulted how other people really do those roles before coming up with her own version. Anyway, it a good cast with an average story, but just for the acting, you have no regrets for it.
B000002UCQ|5.0|We played this (the LP version) innumerable times around the time it first came out (early 70's) and always loved it. But I listened to it for the first time on high quality (...) headphones last night, and was stunned - the quality of the melodic and harmonic composition, plus the lyrics, the mixing and the overall production blows away pretty much anything I can remember.<br />Harrison does not dwell merely in the sunny, facile areas of spirituality - there is depth and dimension in the overall selection of songs and the way the emotion at each one's core is emphatically and specifically realized. Take for instance the hauntingly tender melody and lyrics of \\"The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\", or the probing and achingly insightful \\"Beware of Darkness\\". Even the sunnily positive \\"Apple Scruffs\\"  keeps the identity and precise nature of the character ambiguous, giving the song a heightened sense of mystery.<br />Harrison's more blatantly spiritual paeans, laments, etc. (\\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"Hear Me Lord\\", \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", \\"All Things Must Pass\\"  etc.) are inspirational, heartfelt meditations par excellence. Then there are love songs, both moving (\\"I'd Have You Anytime\\"), and silly (\\"I Dig Love\\" - a filler track, but fitting nevertheless). In my opinion, the only tracks that are throwaways  are the jams (record 3 of the original LP box set) which are grouped together at the end of CD #2.<br />Note that the wall-of-sound concept, first used with great success by Phil Spector's girl groups of the early sixties, then purveyed into more mature forms in his production of the Righteous Brothers, classic Beach Boys' tunes such as \\"Good Vibrations\\" and later yet with the Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\", here achieves a sort of Summa Beatifica.<br />[By contrast, the w-o-s concept didn't work everywhere - it destroyed the promising early sound of Glen Campbell. \\"Gentle On My Mind\\" his first big hit, which was totally gorgeous, had the orchestral tracks turned all the way down so you could only (accidentally) hear them here and there for a second or so at a time; by contrast, Campbell's \\"Wichita Lineman\\" and other later works had the same tasty acoustic guitar work as \\"Gentle . . .\\", but this and his equally stunning vocal work become lost in the swagger of the string and brass arrangements, to the point that his overall sound seems like little more than a Neil Diamond knockoff.]you could only (accidentally) hear them here and there for a second or so at a time; by contrast, Campbell's \\"Wichita Lineman\\" and other later works had the same tasty acoustic guitar work as \\"Gentle . . .\\", but this and his equally stunning vocal work become lost in the swagger of the string and brass arrangements, to the point that his overall sound seems like little more than a Neil Diamond knockoff.]

If you love the movie definaltey get the soundtrack and light a few candles and let it take you to the highlands.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is garbage. It is useful for two things. One, as an instructional video on &quot;How To Recognize Horrible Movies&quot;, and two, as a comedy. A comedy in the sense that the acting and dialogue is laughable. Don't buy Peral Harbor for the laughs though. Wait till A.I. comes out. It's much funnier.

He is a dancer instructor and the entertainment for the Kellerman's. At first, Johnny just think she is a kid and so does his other friends. Baby wins them all. <br />Johnny is someone who does not believe he can have anything unless he uses what he has because he thinks that is what he is capable of. Baby teaches him that he can be someone. Someone special. She sees another side to him that he realize he did not have. <br />Dirty Dancing is about Baby defining and showing everyone that she is an adult. Dirty Dancing is about Johnny believing in himself when he thought that no one did.
B000003TAR|5.0|As many here have stated before me, this is my favorite Nirvana<BR>album out of all of them.  The variety on this album is something to behold.  Jumping from the absolutely incredible main guitar riff in &quot;Dive&quot; to the absurdly catchy-ness of &quot;Son of a Gun&quot;, to the screaming, incoherent, and aggressive vocals in &quot;Beeswax&quot;, this CD just has it all.  In my mind, this is what Nirvana was really about, not the Nevermind record (though a classic in its own right.)  Pretty in some parts, absolutely bizarre and abrasive at others, there's no denying just how good this record is. Every song is a gem, most every song has an original flavor.<BR>In the end, it all makes beautiful sense.  At least to this listener.  *Absolutely Essential*

I have been a long time fan, and it is a plesure to get a personal tour through his life. It is haunting and pugent and you will never send your children to cathloic school again.

6304806442|5.0|I have just read all of your reviews for this EXTREMELY WELL-DONE, FAST-PACED, FLAWLESSLY-WRITTEN, SUPERBLY-ACTED movie, and yes, you have the right to your opinion, but I can't accept the reasons for your disapproval.  You obviously didn't watch the movie because not only are the characters utterly human, funny and emotional, they change and GROW considerably, vying for the viewers' sympathy.  You can't help but watch and see how each turns out.    <br />And it could've been any one of us.  I'm not saying all of us have the capacity to become addicted to a drug, but it DOES happen, and these guys (we'll focus on the men) are REGULAR, football-playing, Sean Connery-loving guys who happen to have a lethal and expensive drug habit.  But what's so wonderful about this film is that the title character, Renton, WANTS to give it up, wants to come clean, and you WANT him to do it, of course.  He fails sometimes, but once he kicks it, you cheer for him, and you hope he has the capacity to stick to his guns.  You almost want to grab his hand and lead him to the end of the movie, making sure he'll be okay.  How powerful a character is that? <br />It's really brilliantly done.  In all honesty, the first time I saw it, I didn't understand it (the accents and the story-line), but seeing it again made me only want to see it more, because with every viewing, I fell in love with Mark Renton (not Ewan, but Mark).  And that's damn good movie making.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I first learned of Shakira through a random CD club purchase and then bought her other album days after listening to her second album.  She is amazingly talented.  This is probably the weakest of her 3 albums (making it very good).  Her use of english is surprisingly good but I think she may have thought too much about what an english speaking audience wants rather than doing her thing.  Her lyrics are poetry.  If you like this album even a little check out her other albums, you will love them even if you don't speak spanish.

There is a reason for everything even if we dont recognize it; It is like saying there are no holes in the ozone layer because you cant see them! I mean no disrespect but there is enough negativity in this world as it is. &quot;if you cant say anything nice, dont say anything at all&quot;. People, please remember to listen to your heart, live by your own truth and do not let others dictate your path!
B00005Q5WC|5.0|Like so many artists of the pasts, their record labels keep crankin' out product.  At least in Marley's case, they keep getting better.  As a collector, I really look forward to a new release from Island/Tuff gong.  The stellar production and bonus tracks are a real treat.  My only wish is that a full length recording, such as Pittsburg '80, would be released.<br />Exodus was a crowing achievement for the Wailers.  Bob certainly reached the top of the Mountain.
0590353403|5.0|I think the Harry Potter book is excellent and  i have read it hundreds of times along with the other four books too. Since i went to see the preview of Harry Potter on the 4th of November it is surely not better than the books. I'll give the movie five out of ten and the book ten out of ten.
B00005LOUQ|2.0|I generally like Ron Howard as a director, but boy did he strike out with this stinker.  &quot;The Grinch&quot; is just awful!  Jim Carrey's muggings garner a few half-hearted chuckles, but the movie is so pointless, plotless, and heartless that all of Mr. Carrey's considerable talents as a comic actor cannot save it. Of course, the butchery of Dr. Seuss' wonderful tale and the Chuck Jones animated feature is quite disturbing to witness.<br />Its creators threw everything but the kitchen sink into this movie, but left out THE crucial part of Dr. Seuss' story- its Christianity.  When all the Whos gather in Whoville to sing &quot;Welcome Christmas&quot; a star rises above them- a clear reference that Christ's birth is the point of Christmas.  However, Opie Cunngingham and his gang made sure that &quot;The Grinch&quot; contained no politically incorrect references to Christianity or religion, and thus stripped the story of its spiritual element.  So the viewer gets a crassly commerical and spiritually empty movie, which is ironically just the sort of thing Dr. Seuss was trying to show what is wrong with Christmas.
B00005N9CV|2.0|With a voice as smooth and inoffensive as white bread soaked in skim milk and a piano style that rarely strays outside the cocktail lounge, Diana Krall has herself locked into a formidable market niche.  But you can't really mistake this for jazz.<br />She can continue to make albums like this as long as her voice holds out, and with as little effort as she expends on singing, that should be about for the next 40 years or so.  She sings everything in the same formless, murky alto, creating the comforting sameness that executives need after a hard day at work firing people and cutting budgets so they can afford their salaries.<br />This is a cruel and evil recording, slick, faceless, manipulative to the Nth degree, perfectly tailored &quot;jazz&quot; for people who know nothing about, and in truth probably would hate, real jazz.<br />I have heard far too many people compare Ms. Krall with other great artists, but the one person she most deserves comparison with is Perry Como.  But even that facelessly bland crooner pales in comparison with Ms. Krall's emptiness.  She is almost Zen in her absence of personality or style, but Zen is never quite as terrifying.  There's something of the android about her that chills the soul.<br />As a marketing gimmick, as smooth muzak for the &quot;adult pop&quot; market, this succeeds, but you have to wonder how evil people have to be to create something like this and pass it off as &quot;jazz.&quot;
B00005T5VE|5.0|The second greatest hits from the most significant female artist of our time! Undoubtedly so, for Madonna has sold over 150 million albums and 50 million singles worldwide. Not only a commercial success, Madonna has managed to come off as a talented musician and performer while juggling the roles of a mother and a wife.<br /><br />This greatest hits is the companion to 1990's 22-million selling The Immaculate collection, something everyone should have known by now. It spans the years from 1991-2001. At the very first glance, the lack of a new song but yet a massive promo campaign might have seem like an attempt at lame commercialism by Warner Bros. In fact, reports said that Madonna didn't want this release so soon. Whichever the case, this 15-track collection stacks up quite nicely with The Immaculate Collection. Obviously, Madonna has enough hits to fill another CD, and these hits were left off to prevent the cannibalization of past catalog album sales. The ommission of new tracks or unreleases songs has again touched the nerves of some fans, nbut no one is ever happy with any tracklist, so these 15 songs are what you'll ever get.<br /><br />The limited edition offers no extras but does come with another lavish paackage this time with more pictures than the standard edition and a nice layout by Grammy-winning art director Kevin Regan who seems to be Madonna's staple creative personnel.<br /><br />Though The Immaculate Collection was largely energetic and truly a milestone in Madonna's career, GHV2 represents a different era for Madonna altogether. It's Madonna constantly rediscovering herself in the 90's with the earlier hits Erotica and Deeper and Deeper. Though excellent songs, they really suffered at the Sex backlash. Erotica, for one, still evokes the kind of mystism and sensuality today. Human Nature, in its clean form (...), shows the world that Madonna had no regrets for what she had done, with a ooh-so-hot video to accompany. When Madonna was hot and sexy, where were those Jennifers and Britneys? Don't Cry For Me Argentina may seem like a sore thumb sticking out of nowhere, but it is really to show the evolution of Madonna into the next stage and paving for her second milestone with Ray Of Light. 4 tracks from the Grammy-winning album show up here including the incredible song Drowned World/Substitute For Love where Madonna lamented about the price of fame over love. This song and Ray Of Light, are some of the highlights here. From her Music album, there's of course the huge title track and the two splendid follow-ups Don't Tell Me and What It Feels Like For A Girl.<br /><br />Once you pop this CD into your player, you are unlikely to stop cos the 15 tracks here, believe it or not, capture the true essence of Madonna in the last decade. From kink to art to spirituality and funk. No one can beat Madonna and no one ever will, in artistry and craft.<br /><br />Long live, the Queen!!!!were those Jennifers and Britneys?

B00000J7SS|3.0|At the time this was issued, Miles seemed definitely afraid of being left behind.  Not that he would ever admit it.  He'd been listening to Hendrix and Sly and the Family Stone, among other things, and had obviously realized that the time he had spent putting down and/or ignoring late period John Coltrane and Albert Ayler was dangerously wasted.  Jazz had moved past him at an alarming rate and he was trying to catch up.  He did all his catching up in one fell swoop, on this album.  Miles dealt with electricity and free jazz all at the same time.<br />That's what scared, and still scares, a lot of people away from this album.  Miles jumped headlong into the future, or what he thought was the future.  His listeners, who still long for &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; or at the very outside, &quot;In A Silent Way,&quot; were dismayed and outraged.  Miles, famously, did not care.<br />In retrospect, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; may not sound as revolutionary as it once did.  The music is obviously a series of jams edited together with varying degrees of success.  There is honestly not much difference between &quot;Pharoah's Dance&quot; and &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; harmonically, and both of them go on too long with no clear direction.  There are moments of inspiration, but honestly very few of them have to do with Miles' playing; the interaction between the various members of the band provides the enlightenment, as it would in almost all Miles Davis recordings beyond this point.  Together the two songs are an interesting exercise in piling diminished and minor chords on top of one another, and trying to solo over same, but overall it's an experiment at best.<br />The second CD is much better than the first, with more coherence and direction both harmonically and improvisationally.  Miles plays better on this disc, and so does everyone else.  Again, it's hard to really tell the compositions apart, but at least this time it's not because of harmonic sameness.  The songs begin and end fairly arbitrarily, which would be appropriate for a project that basically consists of jams edited together.<br />&quot;Bitches Brew&quot; is not as innovative as many people believe it to be.  What happened here was that Miles Davis, a major jazzman, dived headlong into electric jazz and free jazz after ignoring both for far too long.  His fans and listeners at the time were as far behind the times as he was, and therefore were either shocked to death or hailed this as an act of &quot;genius.&quot;  The truth is that it's neither shocking, nor genius; it was a canny move by Davis, and brought him back into a music scene that was beginning to forget who he was.  It also provided him with the opportunity to explore electronic and free sounds.  And you can never rule out that at least some of Miles' motive was to make people mad; he enjoyed infuriating people and going against their expectations, and at this point, Miles was saddled with more expectations than most jazz artists.  This was a great way to alienate the bop dinosaurs and stuffy nosed critics once and for all, which would take the weight of tradition off his back and allow him to move forward.<br />The only trouble was, Miles himself was not sure of where he should go after this, and after a lot of rehashes and misdirections, ended his career hiring Sting to play on his albums and covering Cyndi Lauper tunes.<br />All that out of the way, Bitches Brew is pretty essential for exploratory jazzers, especially the second CD.  I personally think that Miles' live CD, &quot;Dark Magus,&quot; is much more representative of the sound he was trying to make here. It's equally formless but more focused and more fierce. As it stands, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; is an important recording, and maybe an essential one, but don't make more out of it than it is.<br />I also have to mention that there are surprising musical similarities between the music on this album and the music of a German band, Can.  Can were playing liveat the same time Davis was, and I wonder sometimes listening to this if Miles encountered Can on one of his many tours of Europe.  Perhaps; perhaps not.  But listening to this and listening to Can's &quot;Tago Mago&quot; back to back might cause you to sit back and think a bit.live at the same time Davis was, and I wonder sometimes listening to this if Miles encountered Can on one of his many tours of Europe.

0316776963|5.0|I was on a plane to NYC reading &quot;Naked&quot; for my next book group meeting, when I heard someone a few rows down from me burst out laughing.  As I exited the plane, I took a peek at what he was reading and it was &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day.&quot;  A few weeks later, on a road trip, I listened to &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot; and at one point, I had to pull the car over to the side of the road, because I was laughing... so... hard!  Reading (or listening to) his books may put you in some embarrassing situations, but it will be worth it.
0380788624|4.0|This book is pretty long, but i find Stephenson's prose a breeze to get through.  I only had to crack open the dictionary a couple of times.  I suppose it would help to know a good amount about WWII, especially intelligence operations, before reading this book.  Without this knowledge, I still enjoyed it and even learned a few things.  I think I enjoyed the WWII story better- Bobby Shaftoe is a riot.  I also enjoyed the fact that the entire book is written in the present tense.  At first I thought it was wierd, but then I decided it made the future a little more mysterious.  <br />On the downside, Stephenson seems to be obsessed with masturbation- it must be discussed a dozen times throughout the book.  From reading a few other reviews, I agree- the character's relationships are confusing!  There are some characters that seem to disappear, reappear, and be friends with people you never knew they had met before. <br />All in all, a lot of fun, good laughs, and makes you think.
6305014140|5.0|Though a few years old, NINJA SCROLL still stands up as one of the better anime imports. A mixture of ninjas and the super-natural, NS uses a healthy dose of bloody violence, sexual tension, innuendo, and sexual content to keep this horror story moving.<br />The animation is pretty good and the dub is respectable. It's not as visually enticing as PRINCESS MONONOKE, but the story is more linear and direct.<br />I'd recommend it to any anime fan over the age of 16.
B00005RFVL|4.0|Robbie Williams is a clever boy with this album. He is showing versatility, and talent. He's been written off more times than most, but keeps returning with the goods. Love him or hate him, you have to admit that he is an entertainer,and can sing (and write) a decent tune.  With this album his sings the tunes of Frank Sinatra, so while you won't see any of his songwriting you will experience clever re-workings of Frank's greatest hits, including `A Very Good Year' and `Something Stupid'.  Nicole Kidman joins him for `Something Stupid' and it ends up being a great collaboration.  I was pleasantly surprised with the whole album after only one listen.  I greatly encourage lovers of Frank's work to give it a listen.  The cover is great too.
B00005KHLV|5.0|I went to see this film after getting my heart broke. This delicate, enchanting, subtle movie, in which every slight move has meaning, did not remind me of how miserable I felt. Instead, it reminded me the value of love and replanted hope in my mind.
B00005O3VC|4.0|This Movie is a classic, with characters such as Brave Sir Robin, and Everyone's Favorite, the Black Knight. The Only reason it got 4 stars is because it has a really weak ending.
6305657939|4.0|Sexy, clever, and not too predictable.  These words describe Pierce Brosnan's character in this movie.  Loved the ending.
B00005NNMK|4.0|This was Europe at their commercial and musical peak.  They had about a 10-year career, and this release was about at their half-way point.  For sure, it was an enjoyable and memorable effort.<br />The title track is what keeps this band at all remembered, as it is of course heard in sports arenas all over the country.  Still--just sit down and listen to the song on the remastered CD sometime.  It sounds better than ever!  &quot;Rock The Night&quot; is another good single that got less notoriety but is still a great rocking track.  &quot;Carrie&quot;, while not one of my favorite rock ballads, was a huge hit and is still a melodic delight to listen to.  I also particularly like the rockers &quot;Danger On The Track&quot;, &quot;Heart Of Stone&quot;, and &quot;On The Loose&quot;.  All in all, this is a mainstream-sounding but quality hard rock album.  Vocals and guitars both get high marks.<br />While I never buy remastered CDs for the bonus material, I do like the live tracks included as bonus material here.  While I never saw Europe live, these three tracks are a good indication that this band must have been enjoyable to see in concert.  I also like the linear notes that include a good summary of the band's history.<br />It's great to see such '80s material being re-released.  For sure, this is a worthy addition to my rock CD collection.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|The last album that had any edge to it was half Of EMANCIPATION. That album is Sgt. Peppers compared to this. One good song is all I can find on this album. I think Prince is too far out in the Jesus atmosphere to ever come back down. I wish him luck, but his music stinks now. It sounds like he is falling asleep on every track. No invention or excitement. I hope MAYBE someday he will make an album on par with the quality of SIGN, god evn , THE GOLD EXPERIENCE. Yet, i dont think so. Oh, also, his new drummer is technically good, but give me Michael B. any day of the week. This new guy is too technical. Prince, MAKE ANOTHER ROCK ALBUM. Chaos and Disorder is 3000 times better than this. (...)
B00004T8RK|5.0|One must question the title. &quot;Binaural&quot; and what it means.

It is for any audience prepared to follow the in future of progressive rock, which pearl jam has been doing from the start. To those who are still waiting for the next Ten or Vs, pick up your Blink 182 and Third Eye Blind records instead. <br />Much like Radiohead, who I appreciate as Pearl Jam's UK mirror in purly a progression sense, Pearl Jam has been able to maintain a low profile while still selling millions of records, staging world tours, and redifining their sound with every record. Binaural is meant to be raw, meant to be odd, and meant to be cranked up.. so play it LOUD!
B00005O5CM|5.0|If you like comedy movies that are just plain fun to watch and at times a little over the top, than you will love this movie. Legally Blonde is about a California sorority girl named Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) who is going to do what she has to do to win back her man after he dumped her. Her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington III has got excepted to Harvard Law School and Elle knows she needs to do what she has to do to get excepted so she can be there to win him back. Once Elle arrives on campus she realizes it's not going to be as easy as she thought as Warner has a new girlfriend. Elle is going to have the fight of her life to win back Warner but in the process she discovers something far more important... she discovers believing in herself can take her farther than she ever expected. I will not give away any more, but I will say this is a fun movie that will make you laugh. It is in the tradition of such movies like Never Been Kissed, and Miss Congeniality which are just plain fun entertainment which is what these  kinds of movies are meant to do entertain. I would also like to say Reese Witherspoon is one of the most talented actors today, and without her this movie would have not worked as well as it did. This movie was made on a 18 million dollar budget and by the end of its run in movie theatres it ranked in 95 million, not bad at all. If your looking for a feel good movie that at times is a little over the top, and if you have a sense of humor than you will enjoy this movie. Regardless of what some of the other reviewers say LEGALLY BLONDE is a great movie and I encourage any of you to BUY this DVD as it is just a blast to watch and/or makes a great Christmas gift for any teenager.
B00005QIPH|2.0|But I don't. It kind of reminds me when Lenny Kravitz came out with Let Love Rule. If you'd never heard John Lennon or the Beatles before, you might think it was a good record. Well, perhaps enough time has passed that a new generation, unfamiliar with Velvet Underground and what they meant to modern rock'n'roll, will hear this record for the first time and think &quot;how innovative!&quot; Though their impression of V.U. is quite good, I nevertheless would like to hear what the Strokes themselves actually sound like.
B0000027F3|5.0|Vaulting out of their first attempt at a speed metal kind of thing on Ram it Down Priest gets it right on Painkiller.

6303114946|5.0|This film is loosely based on the real story of chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin, who has outranked other junior players by so many points, that he is the first American player since Bobby Fischer who genuinely deserves to be hailed as the &quot;Next Fischer.&quot;<br />Unlike Fischer, however, Waitzkin is a regular kid (or was, he's in his early 20's now), who loves baseball, fishing, other games, like Clue and Monopoly. He also likes playing blitz chess in Washington Square Park with the men, some of them homeless, yet still gifted chess players, who charge tourists for games to make a living, and play one another to prove their prowess.<br />(The Washington Square Park players are real, by the way. Washington Square Park is in Manhattan a few blocks above Greenwich Village. It's a well kept park. Street performers often ply their trade there as well, and you can take your pick of street vended food.)<br />Bobby Fischer single-mindedly pursued chess. He was the son of a single mother, who quite literally spent every moment he could muster working on chess problems. When he could find no one to challenge him, he played himself, and as Max Pomeranc in the film, playing Josh, says &quot;He always won.&quot; Armchair shrinks diagnose Fischer with Antisocial Personality Disorder, Sub-clinical Schizophrenia, Asperger's Syndrome, and a host of other neurological disorders; one of them may be right, but as far as I know, Fischer has never submitted to a D&amp;E.<br />There is nothing wrong with Josh Waitzkin. He loves chess, but not to the exclusion of other pursuits. He loves chess enough to spend most of his time at it, just not all. He loves chess as long as it remains fun. He loves the rush of the daring and audacious blitz chess of the Park. He likes winning trophies at first, but soon the pressure builds, and tournaments become less and less fun, especially after he realizes that the other kids in the tournaments perceive him as the boss at the end of the final level.<br/>When one of the greatest chess strategists in the country becomes his teacher, he declares that the Park will corrupt Josh. Exposing him to the rough underbelly of chess will teach him all the wrong things; he must stick to proper chess; walk don't run. Chess loses its headiness, and for Josh, its fun.<br />Chess in the Waitzkin family had become a means to a winning end. But Josh's parents have not stood idly by. Unlike Bobby Fischer's overworked and overtired mother, unwilling, or unable to struggle with her single-minded son, the Waitzkins realize the adults must make a choice. How much time for chess, and how much for baseball? For other academic subjects? For friends who aren't playing chess with him?<br />It is a grand dilemma. A choice of paths, when the road diverges, and no crystal ball. We know what single-mindedness meant for Bobby Fischer: he drew national attention when he represented his country, winning several international titles. Then he embarrassed his country with complaints and insults about other nations' food, plumbing, and lack of bowling alleys. But he may be neurologically deficient. Josh has no deficits. Did chess make Fischer that way, or was his single-minded devotion a result of an existing impairment?<br />&quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; is Fred Waitzkin's way of saying he is searching for his son the balance that Fischer never achieved. It is wondering which is more satisfying, fame or fitting in. It means wondering whether reclusive Bobby Fischer ever felt satisfaction. It is wondering whether having a talent obliges you to use it. <br />The chess games here are splendidly filmed. Although Max Pomeranc is no Josh Waitzkin, he is a ranked chess player. The chess games are choreographed, but because the children really are accomplished players, they understand the moves, and reproduce them convincing. Their facial expressions and other obvious interest in the games sustain the lengthy and very suspenseful game scenes.<br />Sterling performances from all cast members: Ben Kingsley as Bruce Pandolfini is a marvel of restraint. (The real Pandolfini has a cameo, as does Joel Benjamin, and some other champions.) Joe Mantegna as Fred Waitzkin didn't come across as the man who wrote the book Searching for Bobby Fischer, but he fit into the world of the film. After a couple of viewings, I exorcised the narrative voice of the book from my mind, and Mantegna was very much the father of Max Pomeranc's Josh, about whom I can't say enough, so I won't even get started, and just leave it at that.<br />This is a simple movie: no CGI dinosaurs, hovercraft, guns, bullets, or cars exceeding the speed limit; also, no pan shots of countrysides, big houses, boats, people drinking casually out of glasses with stems, and having all kinds of Deep, Scary Secrets.<br />Don't just see it once. I recommend seeing it at least twice (thrice is better).

It's still the same old No Doubt that we all know and love, but with an awesome twist. I recommend this album to everyone!! &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and &quot;Hey Baby&quot; are sure to please.

B00003CXTG|4.0|It was criticized for being &quot;too Hollywood&quot; with a made-for-movies love story around fictional action heroes on what was supposed to be a historical film. <br />Okay, yeah, it has that.  But what a lot of people don't understand is that those fictional characters are the mixture of several true Pearl Harbor stories taken directly from the veterans themselves.  In fact, nearly everything that happens in the movie has some truth to it.  While the characters may have actually been several people in real life, the essence is what the crew was trying to get across.<br />You learn all about this and the veterans in this well put together DVD that should find a little spot in any movie collector's den.  This movie is good, especially when you understand there is significance in everything.  Even the little dog.
B000001EMW|5.0|This is a great instrumental album!  Metallica has a kind of classical music style (classical as in Mozart, Bach and Beetoven - not Led Zeppelin, black sabbath and ZZtop) to them and being played by cellos really bring that out.  If you think that just the rythm is played...YOUR WRONG!  Kirk Hammets leads  are played note for note and in some songs they play some of the drumming on a cello!  If you are into metal, or classical music, you will love this album!
0790731983|4.0|On traditional grounds, \\"Cabaret\\" is one of the best musicals ever filmed. Its performances, especially Joel Grey's and Liza Minnelli's, are stunning, its dance sequences exuberant, fluid magic. Audiences raised on the usual Hollywood formulas will be surprised by its radical format, cultural savvy, and the naturalness of its dramatic scenes. Director Bob Fosse can strike more emotional chords in one sequence than most musicals do in two and a half hours; he deftly mingles humor with tragedy, irony with joy, exuberance with fear. The songs, while bearing little resemblance to real 1930's cabaret music (and often inferior to those of the stage production), are memorable, tuneful and witty. With these ingredients it seems almost the perfect musical.<br />The trouble is that it is ambitious enough to explore the enigma of Nazi Germany. When dealing with the worst crime of the 20th Century, art can't afford to be frivolous or half-baked. \\"Cabaret\\" triumphs as comedy, drama, and musical theater, but fails miserably as political commentary--on the era that most gravely demands accuracy and care.<br />Sally Bowles' (and Berlin's) naive fascination with \\"divine decadence\\" is made to look grotesque and dangerous through Fosse's lens. Sally is promiscuous and sexually mercenary, and aborts an extramarital pregnancy. Cliff and many others are bisexual, and the titular nightclub is rife with cross-dressing, sadomasochism, androgyny, and other \\"transgressions\\". The movie doesn't condemn these practices per se' (nor should it), but it implies that this \\"moral laxness\\" helped pave the way for the ultimate obscenity of Nazi Germany. At best, this is the cliche of partygoers too busy pleasuring themselves to notice the plague in their city; at worst, it's the epitome of American Puritanism. Either one distorts a crucial issue.<br />The true \\"decadence\\" of 1930's Germany wasn't the hedonism or sexual experimentation of the young, but hypocrisy from above. The same bourgeois elders who cavorted at these nightspots posed as pillars of the community by day. They were moral turncoats, living a lie that acclimatized them for more deadly compromises of their integrity while making them prone to political manipulation. If any kind of \\"decadence\\" hastened the downfall of Germany's humanity it was this charade, this rot from within. Not female mud-wrestling or Cliff and Sally's love triangle with the Baron.

B000059MEK|5.0|The only reason why I got the Album was because of Toonami's Midnight Run Episode where they Showed all 4 Daft Punk Videos and all 3 Gorillaz Videos.<br />Upon seeing their seamless music on the videos, I bought the CD, and was instantly hooked on the smooth music that sound futuristic, yet is easy to handle. <br />A nice CD, only wish they would release the Videos on tape, instead of my lowly VHS copy sitting at home right now...
6300213803|5.0|This was a big success.  I like Kahn in Star Trek.  I don't want to spoil this movie, but I can say that this was directed very well, and it has a teriffic amount of action.  But this movie is also very sad as well as funny.  Why?  You'll have to find out for yourself.  Enjoy!
B00001NFCY|5.0|It went Diamond (10+ million in sales) through the support of amazing live shows and 2 over-played radio hits (Higher, With Arms Wide Open [Are You Ready?, What If were also released]).  But what made this CD wonderfully unforgettable is the songs that haven't made it to the radio (and won't, now that Weathered has been released).  Faceless Man, Never Die, Beautiful... And plenty more, make this CD worth owning for any fan of good music.<br />So much better than Nickelback, Soil, Default, Saliva, and just as good as Mesh.
B00003CXXR|5.0|To start it off this is an excellent movie. It's rated PG-13 but it shouldn't be there isn't a single cuss word and it's not that violent but it's still a great movie.In JP3 Dr. Grant is back instead of malcom(that's a plus). In the movie Dr. Grant has to take  this rich family (so it seems) to Isla Sorna because the people say that they love adventures at first Dr. Grant turns them down but eventually him and his partner in paleontology billy finally give in. When they get to Isla Sorna there plane crashes and as you preveously know Isla Sorna used to be a scientific theme park where they bred dinosaurs but the dinosaurs got out of control so they just left the dinos there and closed the park so the people have to find the visitors centers to try and find any means of communication that still works to get off the island and you probably know they have to go against raptors and the spinosaurs (the spinosaurous kills t-rex) to get off the island. I won't tell you anymore except for it's a great movie and go buy it when it comes out on video (tomorrow, dec.11).
0790736039|4.0|Although the book is scarier, this film delivers!!, all the right elements from the book are here, It begins in 1990 in a small town in Maine(a place you would not want to live) Pennywise the Clown makes his return &amp; kills a young girl, soon the town is shaken &amp; one man(Tim Reid) is sure of his return while everyone else turns their head in the sand, we learn that Reid &amp; six others had a confrontation with Pennywise 30 years earlier when they were children, he then contacts each one to tell them of his return, what makes this film scary is the look on each one's face when they get the call,we learn that each are now very successful adults who have for the most part put this nightmare behind them, when they learn of his return their worst nightmare memories of him begin to re-surface, &amp; their lives are disruppted as they go back in the hopes of killing him this time, Tim Curry is perfect as Pennywise &amp; very convincing as the murderous clown, upon their return he begins to taunt them with images of horror, but the best part is watching the story unfold when they are children &amp; how he scares them to death with his evil laugh, it is told in flashbacks as each remember their encounter &amp; is truly a scary film &amp; one King's better adaptions.

0553274503|4.0|Flowers for Algernon, written by Daniel Keyes, is a fictional account of a mentally retarded man's operation to increase his intelligence, and the eventual regression into ignorance as the effects of the experiment fade.  Charlie Gordon is a mentally handicapped man whose life has been filled with harsh mocking, and he has struggled to become intelligent.  He undertakes an experimental operation to reverse his retardation and make him intelligent.  The experiment is a success, but side effects begin to become apparent, and he slowly begins regressing back to his former state of mind.  The novel is written in a diary format from Charlie's point of view, and includes his experiences with friends, love, and life.  It is a memorable tale of courage shown by this man who wants to be smart his whole life, and when he is finally given intelligence it begins to slip away.  I now feel that I have a new understanding for the mentally retarded, realizing now that even though they may not comprehend as well as others, they still have emotions and feelings.  The story is very moving as Charlie must observe his own regression, knowing fully that he will lose all of the information he has gathered.  It presents an interesting argument of whether it is better to be blindly satisfied and ignorant, but never experience the world in full, or to be obtain the intelligence that one searches for their entire life only to have it taken away.  Overall this book is an interesting story of one man's search for his true self in intelligence and ignorance.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I found the movie to be very enjoyable.  I liked the story line because it made me laugh, it made me cry, I felt emotions on many different levels and that is what makes a movie worth watching.  I rented it and liked it so much I've been bugging my boyfriend everyday about buying it for me for Christmas.<BR>I do have some complaints though.  The beginning of the movie moved quickly and the scenes did not flow well together, they were choppy.  About 40 minutes into the movie the bombing took place and everything started coming together.  The special effects were great.<BR>I hope everyone enjoys watching the movie as much as I did.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This music score is perfect for the movie. Every piece reflects the moods portrayed in the movie and book, and doesn't overpower the visual part of the movie, but blends with it to a certain perfection that creates a fuzzy feeling inside. After listening to it, you want to again. It gives a sense of wonder and mystery. Simply amazing [stuff], I gotta say. Thats why it deserves 5 stars and Harry Potter kicks some serisous donkey!
6300183971|1.0|I'll be honest, I only watched the last half of this movie, and in that last half hour were about twice as many things that were made up, left out, or completely changed than the entire Sci-Fi miniseries.  It's like he made a movie that was just a rip-off of Dune and then go the licnese for it.   WTF is up with those stupid little sound guns!?!?!!  They fricking changed how the main villian (the Baron) dies, for god sake.  Alia acts like she is possessed by the Devil, she is supposed to be creepy, sure, but this is too much.  They changed the sitautions about Paul becoming the Haderach.  They changed how the last battle goes.  THye changed how the Baron dies.  They changed the ending, so much in fact, I actually felt anger.  The ending is more disgraceful than all of BattleField Earth.  The ending basicaly changes the whole Dune novel series.  How come Paul can shatter stone by yelling at it? How come the Reverend Mother is bald and clad in Black Leather?  If you haven't read the book, the plot makes no sense. If you have, you will realize how much of the plot has been butchered.  There's a scene where the Guild approaches the Emperor and warns him of Paul drinking the water of life. Please explain to me how the Spacing Guild knows of Fremen Custom  This movie is so bad, I wish there was a zero star rating.  Ugh.
B00005RFVL|5.0|YES.. Totally love it, we had the 60`s 70`s 80`s revival.. <BR>But wait there will be more.. Here comes the 50`s. Robbie is bringing it with a (HOT) swing that will bring a smile on your face.. BUY NOW, PAY LATER (50`s quote !!)
B00005RFVL|4.0|The same man who sang 'Millennium' and 'Rock DJ' might not seem like the right person to croon 'Beyond the Sea' or 'Mr. Bojangles,' but believe it or not, Robbie Williams and swing are a perfect fit.  Great Britain's reigning king of pop (with help from some high-profile guest vocalists) manages to pull off fourteen daunting Rat Pack classics with all the cool, passion and sense of fun they deserve.<BR>Backed by Frank Sinatra's original band, Williams has rarely sounded better than he does on this record.  The smooth informality of songs like 'Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me' and 'Straighten Up And Fly Right' is well-suited to his personality; one listen to his spirited rendition of 'Mack The Knife' (recorded in one take) and any initial skepticism should lift away.  It's obvious throughout the album that this isn't a vanity project from a star trying to prove he can pull off anything, it's an impassioned endeavor by a student of Messrs. Sinatra, Martin and Davis Jr. which comes off as a mix of great exhiliration and respect.<BR>The various duets are enjoyable for the most part.  The 'Somethin' Stupid' duet with Nicole Kidman (receiving buzz for its sexy video) is very conventional, but the chemistry between Kidman and Williams is quite comfortable.  Through the magic of technology, 'It Was A Very Good Year' splits the verses between Williams and Frank Sinatra himself.  Obviously an important and humbling experience for Williams, it's a very simple production, and while the song is as powerful as ever, it disrupts the momentum of the mostly fast-paced album.  Not being the biggest Jon Lovitz fan, I found the back and forth banter of 'Did You Evah' to be a little bit ostentatious.  Jane Horrocks (of 'Little Voice' and 'Ab Fab' fame, in her second collaboration with Williams) is a game companion for 'Things,' Rupert Everett provides laid-back and easy accompaniment for 'They Can't Take That Away From Me.'  Best of the bunch is Robbie's cheeky duet with best mate Jonathan Wilkes on 'Me And My Shadow.'  The affection these friends have for each other is evident as is the infectious fun they have recording this song. Wilkes' startup pop career may have stalled, but his voice is quite pleasant, even if it does get overshadowed by some of Robbie's playful new lyrics.<BR>The remainder of songs are covered with ease.  Robbie's rendition of 'Mr. Bojangles' is particularly moving and passionate, 'Have You Met Miss. Jones?' is also featured on the 'Bridget Jones' Diary' soundtrack.  The only new material is the first track, 'I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen,' a suitably orchestral opener to the album, with heartfelt (if slightly cumbersome) lyrics.  Over 25 minutes into 'Beyond The Sea,' after a lengthy silence are located a series of hidden outtakes from the recording sessions which, quite simply, are a laugh riot.<BR>In the end, Williams has managed to gain further credibility by effortlessly doing justice to a collection of songs originally sung by men he greatly admires.  At the same time he loses none of the audacious charm or energetic earnest which helped propel him to stardom in the U.K.  Robbie Williams is utterly at ease in the world of swing, and he makes it easy to enjoy the cool classics of yesterday like they are as new as tomorrow.
0345451325|5.0|Great book! Gives you a sense of history for Halo. Can't wait to get my hands on the game!
B000000JO3|5.0|When someone asks me about what they think the best rock album ever is i can say a few records that come to mind, but it would be hard to pick out one album above all the rest, what with so many different styles and composure.  The same goes for almost any type of music - rap, punk, ska... whatever.<BR>But when someone asks me to pick the best hardcore album ever it's simple.  Because this is the truth - Minor Threat's &quot;Complete Discography&quot; is the best harcore album ever.<BR>There's no second thoughts in my mind.  I don't even think of another album... no need to contimplate.  There are tons of great hardcore records, but this album is something else... something amazing.  It's 26 songs about growing up and mostly the straight edge movement (eg. No drugs or alcohol).  From the start to the end, there is not a single track that will dissapoint.  Packing so much meaning and thought into a 1 and a half minute song could never be pulled off by another band.  I used to drink alcohol about 2-3 times a week and now i hardly touch a beer, if ever.  I know it sounds like i'm preaching but it's simply the truth.  They have been covered by the likes of the Beastie Boys, AFI, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Suicide Machines, NOFX, Sublime, Sick of it All, and Rage Against the Machine.  So you know how influential they were and still are.  You have to check out this album... even if you don't by it, it would be a shame to just forget about it.
0060934913|4.0|This book was an absolute pleasure to read. For those of us who spend a lot time in restaurants, who are curious about lifestyles and avocations different from our own, or who simply like food (cooking, eating, etc.), this book satisfied my appetite. Beyond the raw, in-the-moment descriptions of the author's learning experiences and adventures in the chefing industry, the pure enthusiasm that he conveys is worth the time and attention. I can't imagine anyone not finishing this book and being glad that they found it.
B000059H99|4.0|I don't think the film \\"Rocky\\" is as appreciated in todays society as it is deserved to be. It's an amazing film with a fine story and some amazing characters. The film series has become somewhat of a punchline as the years went on. More of a cliche, except by those who remember its purity and substance when it was first released.    Rocky is a down and out boxer from the poor streets of Philadelphia who falls in love with a local girl, and by sheer happenstance finds himself in the fight of his life against the reigning boxing champion of the world. Seems like such a simple premise, yet so much was happening between all it's characters, that the film never got dull or over the top.    Stallone out did himself and surprised everyone when he delivered this outstanding performance. How could you not root for this guy and feel his despair, pain and dreams as his life was happening.     His supporting cast was nothing short of excellent. A great mix of very different characters. A drunk, loud, jealous brother. An extremely shy woman, with a heart of gold underneath all her insecurities. An over the top glory hungry boxing champ. An old disgruntled trainer with dreams of managing a champ.    I don't think people appreciate the very real fact that it took Stallone a few days to write this script or how he had to fight the studios to let him play the lead. How different this film would have turned out if the studios first choice, Ryan O'Neal, played the lead role.    Will Stallone ever play a finer role than he did in the original Rocky? Probably not. He was \\"Rocky\\" in every way possible, and it was amazing for him to have let the viewers experience that for ourselves.
B00003CX8J|5.0|VERY good movie for it's genre. It's no Godfather. It's no Apocalypse Now. It's not The Patriot. But as far as Sci-Fi goes, this is TOPS. Generally speaking, sci-Fi movies aren't Academy award winners, and to me, many Academy award winners (are bad) - am I right? you can't disagree... The X-Men is definitely at the top of it's class.<br />REALLY good actors (Hugh Jackman ROCKS as Wolverine) and actresses (gotta love Halle Berry - she plays STORM), great special effects, and the movie is complete, yet leaves JUST enough open for a sequel. I bought it on DVD and I love it. Great entertainment, purely entertainment. You gotta at LEAST rent it and see what I'm talking about.
B00005B36H|5.0|It's amazing. That's all there is to it.<br />Lateralus is my favorite Tool CD.  I have liked Tool since Opiate and every new CD they come out with I like better than the last.  I definently think Lateralus has more depth to it than Aenema, making it more enjoyable in the long run.<br />And Luke, go listen to some little angry teenagers whining about their parents (ie. Linkin Park, Staind, etc.), I won't bother you about it if you enjoy it that much, I just don't think your the person who should be reviewing a Tool CD... I bet a couple ticks after 3 minutes and your zoned out or asleep, am I right? Haha, yea, I thought so.<br />But anyways, go buy it, then review it and let us know how much you love it.
B000056BSA|3.0|While it may not be the best movie with a mix of comedy or drama, there is a good enough mix to give you an interest. And after interest, there is nothing better than watching someone cook, and do it so seductively as Penelope Cruz. The Brazilian music is deeply enchanting and lures you into the plot of the movie.<br />The plot is not difficult to understand, basically a love story, a passion for love intermingled with food. A delightful movie if you're in the movie for something not too comedic, not too dramatic - and just in the movie for a popcorn movie.
0385505833|5.0|I have been a John Grisham fan for years.  I have every book he has written but this the best.  It is a quick read here in the hustle and bustle of Christmas leaving you with lasting thoughts and bringing back memories of calmer, quieter times when all we had to do was wait for Santa. The humor made for out-loud laughter and the somber moments brought a tear or two. There truly is a reason for tradition with a few less extremes.
B00005JKHP|1.0|Why does Star Trek even exist?  Many people claim it as a life, but if you need this tripe for a life, you don't really deserve whatever satisfaction you get from watching movies this bad.  This movie never goes anywhere.  The approximate running time feels about 5 days.  There are only interminable plot machinations intermingled with simple special effects.  Melies could have done better with the effects.  Even for people like Trekkies, this movie is a stretch.  I say that even with an incredibly low regard for Trekkies.  This movie has taken hours of my life that I can never have back.  For that I say, damn you and your girdle Shatner.
B000002HAJ|5.0|You know the Cure have gone romantic from the inner sleeve, where they quote a few touching lines from Percy Bysshe Shelley, English Romantic poet extraordinaire.  And the album does seem pretty romantic with some latter-day Cure classics as &quot;From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea&quot; and &quot;Doing the Unstuck.&quot;  But this album is also notable for the way frontman Robert Smith rediscovers his guitar.  The album contains some of the pleasantest Cure guitar since &quot;Play for Today,&quot; from the &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; album.  &quot;Green Sea&quot; has a killer riff, repeated many times over.  And &quot;Cut,&quot; with its wah-wah overdubs and feedback, gives truth to Smith's sometimes puzzling statement that Jimi Hendrix was one of his key influences.  The album does contain some slow-song filler, like &quot;To Wish Impossible Things&quot; and &quot;A Letter to Elise&quot;; without a strong opposite presence in the band to edit his impulses, Smith tends to pack the Cure's albums with songs that may be &quot;close to me,&quot; but are hardly compelling listens for me.  But the album has some other fine tunes:  the gorgeous &quot;Open,&quot; a reminiscence of drunkenness; the well-written &quot;Apart&quot;; and the hit &quot;Friday I'm in Love.&quot;
B000002LCX|5.0|I've allways agonized over recomending, 'Strangeways' or, 'The Queen Is Dead'. 'Unhappy Birthday', 'Stop Me..' and, 'Death Of A Disco..' r in my opinion, the JEWELS here. I also agonized over how to rightiously review such a STUNNING album.
0783113943|5.0|The acting by Angelina Jolie in this movie was a precursor to her academy award winning role later.  This is a tragic but true story about a woman who just wants to be loved and gets terribly horribly lost in that search. Thought provoking and insightful.  Bring tissues.
B0000009SG|2.0|When it comes to Zappa, I am a dissenter. His early stuff has its place in rock history; \\"Hot Rats\\" is a minor landmark in jazz-rock fusion. After that, I find absolutely nothing to like about what he did. As satire, it's half-baked; as music, it's just a conglomeration of pop junk  (...)  that is supposed to make some kind of statement--what, exactly, pray tell, would that be? That pop music is dreck to be recycled in Zappa's lab? I don't believe I have ever needed Frank Zappa to tell me that most pop music is worthless; I knew that already. But pop music is worthless in a way that can sometimes approximate worth. Phil Spector's productions would be an example. Phil Spector believed in what he was doing; Frank Zappa did not. Zappa thought he was above popular music, a strange and lame attitude. The CD under review is often cited as one of his best efforts, merging \\"jazz-rock\\" \\"sophistication\\" with \\"humor.\\" I am no geek in some comic-book shop, and I do not find \\"Going to Montana to find some dental floss\\" funny. This is sophomoric, arid music for disengaged pseuds. Zappa's libertarian \\"satire\\" is not a part of my world, and neither are his attempts at \\"serious\\" music--half-digested Varese and Stravinsky and Ives. Three minutes of Captain Beefheart is worth all of Zappa's catalog. Who was it who said that, for all Zappa knew about music, he lacked the talent to write a song as good as \\"Louie Louie\\"?
078062565X|5.0|King Kong remains, in the true sense of the word, a romance of the highest order. It is a definite product of its era which adds to its enjoyment. Even by 1933 standards, the acting suffers at times but does not hurt the film. I have never witnessed a progression of action with music like that in the log scene. From the time the raft is tipped over through Kong dumping the log into the ravine, the last clinging sailor screaming in terror, I was held absolutely spellbound. As for herbivorous dinosaurs attacking, we need to look no further than rhinos, African water buffalos and even moose. It's a romantic fantasy adventure in the best story telling tradition.
6300214540|4.0|Can anybody think of military aviation, the late 1980's, patch-covered leather jackets or patriotic rousing boffo blockbuster flicks and not think of this flick? In the story, Tom \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell is the typical bad-boy fighter pilot, a naturally gifted fighter-driver lacking any trace of discipline.  Haunted by the mysterious fate of his father who was lost flying a Navy Phantom over North Vietnam, Mav is driven to succeed - even if that requires him to make high-speed passes over control towers, carrier decks and admirals' daughters.  When he and a wingman intercept a pair of \\"MiG-28's\\" over the Indian Ocean (real MiGs are odd-numbered only),. Mav is tagged to go for \\"Top Gun\\", the Navy's elite fighter-pilot school.  There his strengths and his weaknesses as an F-14 driver become painfully clear to everybody, especially the school's top ace, \\"Viper\\" Metcalfe (Tom Skerrit) and fellow-student \\"Iceman\\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer).  In a paint-by-numbers script, Mav falls for Top Gun's civilian analyst (Kelly Mcgillis), loses his close friend \\"Goose\\" (a pre-ER Anthony Edwards) in an freak mid-air accident, learns to doubt himself, grow up and become a real Top Gun in time for a climactic battle between a sextet of the evil MiG-28's.  <br />So why is this movie so important?  Why not try asking anybody who's tried to follow-up this aero-classic using real airplanes and not CGI.  15 years later aerial footage from both this film and \\"Iron Eagle\\" are still used as stock, though it's clear that TG's is better, and nobody has even come close to surpassing it, CGI or otherwise.  Though the plot is easily dismissed as unrealistic, the flight scenes go above and beyond in conveying the speed and gravity of these airplanes - especially the F-14 which is among the largest fighters in the world.  (The F-14's large size is a liability in real combat, but also makes the plane much more cinematic than smaller jets like the Hornet or the F-16).  Nothing is easy for these guys (and thefatal spin near the film's climax superlatively shows just how dangerous a job it is).  Patriotic?  How evil!  Actually, though a tribute to real fighter-drivers, this flick isn't really all that jingoistic (unless you're the type who feels that the sight of any military hardware is necessarily jingoistic), and the mysterious nature of the dreaded MiGs is further proof of no flag-waving.  (MiG's are Russian, but the Exocet missiles they carry are French; The Russians had no aircraft carriers capable of launching true fighter-jets until the end of the cold-war, and probably had few of their own airbases on the Indian Ocean in the mid 1980's.)  A simple plot?  Sure, but better than something convoluted.  On the clearly plus side, the special effects are matchless, the sound and editing are tops and the photography (in which southern California skies are purple, and even sunlight looks liquid) is simply beautiful.  The editing really makes the film - with flight scenes cut so quickly that you never realize how slow the mammoth F-14's are really flying.   I'd get this film in wide-screen to bring out the effects.  If you feel the need for speed - don't be cheap.
0800184327|4.0|If you like dancing this film is for you.  Lots of dancing where people are really having fun.  The story could be better but Vanessa William and Chayanne work well as a team, sound good together and are both very easy on the eyes.  The music is hot and fits the movie perfectly.  Also some very funny bits.  Fluff but I mean that nicely.
0425107469|5.0|It's seems I'll be breaking a trend with this review, but it's my honest opinion that this is not in actuality Mr. Koontz's finest work.  Well, I suppose it depends on what it is that you are looking to get from the book.  I would humbly argue that &quot;Fear Nothing&quot; was a more compelling read in that it further stretched my imagination and left me with a more profound sense of wonderment. For weeks after I had finished it I was still left with a sense that there is the potential for amazing things that are beyond my knowing...  Anyhow, I did thoroughly enjoy &quot;Watchers&quot; but I am far from believing (as many of the other reviewers seem to do) that it is worthy as being forementioned as a classic. The book is strongest in the development of it's characters.  You will undoubtedly come to love Travis, Nora, and inevitably most deeply of all, Einstein. Koontz seems to  have the innate ability to give the characters a tangible sense of depth that transcends the limitations of print.  You may even come to find yourself identifying with the characters, searching yourself for ways in which you are alike. Not all is perfect, however.  The book lacks any real intriguing plot twists; the basic manner in which the book will end can be guessed well before finishing the first half of it's 500 some odd pages.  And suspense you ask?  Well, the first 10 pages are by far the most well written and suspenseful of the novel.  Also, I thought too much time was spent probing the character of Lemuel Johnson.  In the end the relationships between Einstein, Travis, and Nora are what made this book, period.  There is some suspense but if you're looking for a &quot;page-turner&quot; I think you'll be dissapointed.  And I guess it is always interesting to read a book that takes place in your own backyard.

6304342160|5.0|Now that's what I like about this movie.  The women figure out how to outsmart the bad guys.  How many movies can you say that about?  Fast paced.  Tilly just purrs and Gershon has the best smirk in town.  Enjoyable all the way around.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Have listened to this CD again several times after it had been sitting on the shelf for a year or so. I liked it when it was released and more so now.    Sometimes after you're familiar with a recording, you don't play it for a while. You look at it and think, \\"I've heard that one so many times.  I'm going to play something different.\\" When you finally put it back into your player, you realize why you bought it to begin with. That was the case for me with Driving Rain.    This terrific, underrated album that so highlights the problems of being a \\"rock legend\\" who has held that status for over four decades: so many people remember your past and want to hear nothing else but those old songs. So many music fans today who are around my age (41) refuse to admit that there's any good music being made today and listen to nothing but \\"classic\\" rock, to the point that they won't even listen to anything new by a classic rock artist. These people seem to think that an artist of McCartney's age should just go away and wait to die - witness some of the negative reaction to his \\"safe, boring\\" Super Bowl halftime performance.    If such people would only open their minds and ears, they'd discover a whole world of great new music, by new and not-so-new artists. Driving Rain is a fine album. Some people just will never forgive Paul for the unforgivable sin of not being a Beatle anymore. Somehow when the Beatles used \\"1-2-3-4\\" as a lyric in a song, it was genius, yet when Paul uses \\"1-2-3-4-5\\" as a catchy hook on the title track here, people trash it as some childish, simplistic lyric.  Some Americans also don't get that Paul isn't an American.  In \\"She's Given Up Talking\\", he uses the expression, \\"not a dickie bird\\".  This basically means the opposite of \\"a little bird told me\\" and is a known expression in the U.K.  So before you trash Paul for some lyric that to you may be nonsense, do a little research.  There is a world beyond American shores.    So if you're over 40 like I am, give a chance to some newer music by a classic artist. And if you're under 40, open you're mind to a true music legend.    And about that halftime show:  He put on a terrific performance and was in fine voice.  For people who said he was \\"boring\\", does that mean you were thrilled or titillated by teeny-bopper idol Justin Timberlake pulling the shirt off of has-been Janet Jackson the previous year?  If so, you've got more issues than can be described in this space.  As for being a \\"safe\\" choice, yep, choosing one of the most talented songwriters and performers in music history is a pretty safe choice.  And an entertaining one.  Personally I think they should have canceled the 3rd quarter and let Paul play another thirty minutes.  I'm not so sure the crowd would have minded.  Bring Paul back next year, or sign the Eagles to do halftime.
B000051S44|5.0|I saw this movie as a kid and feel in love with it then. Spent most of my adult life trying to find it. One of the \\"great\\" race movies ever... even the stunts were great! Well worth the $($$$)!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I sat down on to watch a movie I really knew nothing about but the reviews on this very page.  I was really impressed with the acting and the story.  It unfolded beautifully and anyone who doesn't require explosions, machine guns and a movie that will keep you guessing will love this movie.  Thumbs up.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|From a musician's point of view, Fiona Apple is a phenomenal artist. Her lyrics are so beautiful and placed so well into her incredible piano riffs. Even if you aren't a fan, just go ahead and spend the money. When you listen to this cd and realize the genius of this chick, you'll wonder how on earth they can put a price on it at all. If you have any size collection of music at all, it will never be of any value without this album.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I liked the Strokes when they were the Stooges. Do yourself a favor and buy Funhouse instead (im sure the strokes themselves have listened to it alot).  Its much more innovative and well basiclly their whole sound and look.  Hey even the video is reminiscent of the early 70's.  With Iggy Pop, i mean the strokes lead singer doing his best Iggy Pop impersination.  <br />When anything is copied it can never match the original.  Its fine if the Strokes want to do this kind of music but shame on the music industry for promoting and showing it on MTV all the time.  There are too many exciting and innovative bands that are going overlooked.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Honesly, I had never heard of the Strokes until I saw their video (which is god-awful and doesn't do them any justice).  Anyway, I downloaded &quot;Last Nite&quot; and promptly went and bought &quot;Is This It&quot;.  Now normally I'm not into bands such as this but these guys are good.  There are some areas (and I say areas because every song has at least one good part, its just a minute of time or so) that I just can't like, and that's what makes fall short of the hype I had for it, but it's still a great romp into a New York scene that I've never experienced but can totally picture when I listen to this. &quot;Hard To Explain&quot; has an awful beginning, but ends up a decent song.  The real masterstroke's are &quot;Last Nite&quot;, &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; and the king daddy, &quot;Is This It&quot;.  If you were expecting a album full of &quot;Last Nite&quot;'s, you may be somewhat dissapointed, but not jipped.
B000002MFE|5.0|Clapton sheds all his electric crutches and strides forth on this album with all his musical talent bared for our enjoyment. The tempo and mood of his selections varies from soulful renditions of &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Lonely Stranger&quot; to the light and upbeat &quot;Alberta&quot; and &quot;San Fransico Bay Blues&quot;. Every song is a treasure.<br />Of particular note is his rendition of &quot;Layla&quot;. It is a long way from the big, rockin' version he did with Derek and the Dominoes. It is almost a ballad here, relaxed and refined like a fine wine coming of age. <br />Clapton shows his musical maturity, relying on finely crafting his work, rather than overwhelming us with big productions and lots of riffing and fast picking. His voice is sure and strong, unlike some other old rockers who can barely talk anymore. His emotional renditions can be compared with the best of Bluesmen, past and present. He has shown us in the past that he can do anything; here he shows us can do what is appropriate for the setting.<br />If you are looking for a great CD to relax with and do a little foot-tapping; here it is. This is one I still reach for weekly after all these years.
B00002Z88D|4.0|Quite possibly the most imaginitive thing that Metallica could do is to pair themselves with a symphony.  The sound of Metallica can still be heard ringing through on this, the latest of their efforts, which showcases some of their most popular songs in something of a different atmostphere, managing to push Metallica fans to the point of ectasy, while begrudging true classical music fans.  Including only one or two new songs and changing some of the old ones, this new installment of Metallica appears to be only a phase that the band is going through.<br />James Hetfield's gruff, chainsaw-sounding voice over quiet, innocent sounding violins and cellos is something of an enlightening experience.  For Metallica fans that have followed the band through the course of &quot;And Justice For All,&quot; and &quot;Metallica,&quot; not to mention the recent &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload,&quot; this experience should not be missed.  <br />The main concern that I, as a fan of Metallica, originally had was that the songs that were revamped through the course of this experiment would somehow be altered the the point of no longer holding for me the same meaning they once did.  This is not the case, however, since &quot;S&amp;M&quot; actually increases the desire the hear the original version of the songs for both purposes of comparison as well as to hear how true the band remains to their faithful music.  <br />If this album is not part of your collection, it should be.  If you don't like Metallica, you will.
B00003CX5P|4.0|If this is what the first 3 movies are going to look like, then I hope Lucasfilm is busy working on them. Clarity is outstanding. Better than the theatre version in that you can jump over the slow scenes.
B00005Q66T|5.0|The point of this album wasn't to release all her greates hits of the last decade...it was to offer a retrospective of 15 amazing songs.  Other reviewers complained about &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, &quot;Human Nature&quot; and &quot;Drowned World&quot; not being hits...well excuse me, but they were.  &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; became one of Madonna's greatest dance hits of all time spending a record-breaking 16 weeks on Billboard's Club Play Chart (not to mention peaking at #1). &quot;Human Nature&quot; was a club hit,too, and &quot;Drowned World&quot; was a hit in Europe and Japan.  Did you guys stop to consider that maybe Madonna considers these to be her greatest hits- as a songwriter, producer, and singer?  Don't be disappointed with this album!  A lot of people were expecting an Immaculate Collection 2, but that this is not!  I think that's why it's called GHV2 instead, because, unlike the Immaculate Collection, most of these songs are edgier, funkier, and more mature.  So while the Immaculate Collection is great-filled with many mainstream pop hits, think of GHV2 as Madonna's &quot;underground pop&quot; hits! Buy it!!
B00004STPT|5.0|the GLADIATOR soundtrack is incredible. it shows what true talent and beauty in music is! when one listens to this soundtrack they forget that they are in reality. the music is so captivating and deep that it takes the listener to another place. i have heard other work from Zimmer but this by far tops them all. anything as beautiful as this is hard to find. each song has it's own &quot;story&quot; and its own truth. It's something that should not be looked over because one has not heard true beauty until they here the GLADIATOR soundtrack!!!!!!
B00003CXXS|5.0|Non-stop action and adventure! Exciting all the way until the end. Amazing effects! Get this movie!!
B00000J7SS|4.0|The guy flat out nearly ruins the album. His playing is so stale and polished, in all it's technical glory, that it takes away from the feeling in Miles Davis' playing. The contrast feels like it's tearing the album apart most of the time. Take the title track for example, Corea's riff which leads into the song, after the intro, works well. But as the song goes on he plays complicated polyrhythms that feel too polished. It almost sounds like Davis is cutting him off, with his solo's, from being too polished. In short Corea mars most of the album, it really says something that it's still brilliant despite his playing style.  <BR>The improvisation here is brilliant, the group had clearly gelled to the point of having an almost psychic ability to improvise off of and with one another. The music sound emotional all the time, but Corea's playing, or Zawinul's, or Young's; I still think it's the ever polished Corea's, mars the album's emotion with fine technique. It stands out way too much, even Davis subverts his playing to the group and it's his album. Damn Corea's ego!

B000002H38|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best albums I have ever purchased in my entire life.  I never tire of playing it.  Every song is great and Anita's voice is top notch.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Back in '98, when I heard that Cher was gonna release a dance album, I thought it was a big joke. BELIEVE became Cher's &quot;come back&quot; album. BELIEVE is an excellent dance/pop album. Cher really fits right into the club/electronic scene with this one. On each track Cher sings with passion. It sounds like she's been singing dance music for a long time but BELIEVE was her first dance album. The classic hit &quot;beleive&quot; still sounds fresh today, even thought it was a bit over played in '98. Other groovy gems are &quot;run away&quot;, &quot;all or nothing&quot;, &quot;taxi taxi&quot;, and &quot; we all sleep alone&quot;. BELEIVE transformed Cher into a dance diva!
B00005R2M3|5.0|It was just the perfect time to release an english album, people from around the world where really expecting this one, i think she really did great, because she didnt speak that well english, and as we can see she really learned it fast. She stills need to improve her accent, but still its great and the perfect time to reach a different audience, who were really wanting to understand her. Shakira couldnt keep them waiting more because this proyect is very old and people were really anxious to hear it. Well finally here it is, a lot of risk was involved, she had the guts to release it and she managed to do a great job! This work shows us she is a strong character woman, ready to hear the critics and ready to give much more, like she always have! Not many latin singers have done what she has done, to release as well ballads, which is where her accent shows a little more. <BR>The songs are great, stylish, sly, from the heart, it is an album to really enjoy! I think ill be listening to it for some time in my car!
B000000OPU|5.0|Rank this one up there with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Beatles White Album. A work of uncomprimising musical integrity and skillful pop song writing. Lyrically poetic and musically diverse. A must have for music collectors from all backgrounds. Transcends gernes and labels. It just is simply Peter Gabriel at his intelligent, creative best.
0316776963|1.0|I feel so bad for the author because there is not one thing in his life that is worth living for.  He hates everything and everyone, and he makes that crystal clear with every word he set to paper.  His descriptions are bad...some border on cruel and evil.  His &quot;humor&quot; is directed towards 5 year olds or the brain-damaged.  I don't know how this book ever got published.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I found the movie cute. Typical girl, following her love to a place she wasn't expecting. I love the fact that she comes out on top, and without the piece... anyway. It's plain dumb, seriously. I still liked the movie a lot. The soundtrack kicks too. And, is it not based on a true story?
B00005N83M|3.0|Well, her voice isn't as bad as Britney's, which is entirely computer-enhanced.  And she can entertain without resorting to gimmicks.  Jennifer simply doesn't have that great a voice.  However, that doesn't matter when her songs become hits and this album has sprung four big ones so far.                                                                          It's a good, but not a great album and worth buying at a discount.  The hit singles are the best reason to buy it, especially the &quot;Murder Remix&quot; of &quot;I'm Real&quot;, which was added a few months after the first release of the original &quot;J. Lo.&quot;.  There are a few pretty good non-singles on this.  The rest is somewhat unmemorable filler.                                            The best songs are:  &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot;-Still my favorite single, although we've all heard it a million times.                                                                                &quot;I'm Real&quot; (Original Version)-A fun, catchy tune which oddly features her ex, P. Diddy (or Puff Daddy, P. Diddly, Sean Puffball Combs, or whatever he calls himself now) who utters &quot;She's a bad, bad, b@#$%!&quot; in the background.  Oddly, Puffy has written three of the songs on this hit album.                                                                               &quot;Play&quot;-Not great, but catchy.  Of course, this is where Lopez curses for the first time.  It works here, because it comes out of left field.  I just hope she doesn't think that she HAS to curse to sell records (which is a big complaint for Janet Jackson's &quot;All For You&quot; album).                                                                        &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot; and &quot;Carrino&quot;-Two tunes with fun Latin beats.                                            &quot;I'm Real&quot; (Murder Remix)-What an awful name for a remix!  Anyway, it displays the talents of Ja Rule, a tough-minded rapper with a tender side.  The song starts in-your-face, then gets touching, and Ja Rule and J. Lo. work well together.  Lopez utters the &quot;N&quot; word a couple of times, which caused some controversey.  While I'm not offended by the lyrics, she shouldn't sing any ghetto-style lyrics.  They clash with her image.                                            The two songs that precede &quot;I'm Real&quot; are pretty good Spanish tunes.  The rest of the album is rather dull.      Overall, a good buy if you're a fan, or just want her hits.
0446608955|5.0|This is the BEST! Everyone who is thinking about reading this book should read it. It is SOOO good. I wish ever guy was like Landon and that everyone was a sweet as Jaime she couldn't have been anymore more of a sweetheart. I cried for like the last 30 pages, it was well worth it. READ THIS BOOK! I promise you will love it.
B00003CXXI|5.0|It's a really excellent movie. My 3-yr old daughter likes it so much that she watches it almost every day since I brought her to the movie then bought a video of the movie for her about one month ago.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I am a longtime fan of No Doubt, and I have been waiting for Rock Steady for months.  I am very excited about it, though I have to admit that the sound is much different from No Doubt's previous work.  It is has a lot of reggae influence with electronic sounds as well.  Ska it is not, but you could never really fit No Doubt into a category.  I think that is part of their appeal.  I have enjoyed the CD a great deal and I highly recommend it to any No Doubt fan.  Well, I highly recommend it to anybody - the music is fun and catchy and is a pleasant departure from Britney Spears.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD is soooo good! Most people don't like Britney's voice but I like it! It's different and kind of playful and cute. But anyway, this CD is one of the best CDs ever! I know that because every single one of the songs is good. It's not full of album fillers and one or two hits. <br />1. I'm A Slave 4 U- Good song. A jungle beat feel. Not one of my favorites but it's hot!<br />2. Overprotected- I really like this one. A bass-thumping rant about being overprotected. <br />3. Lonely- FAVORITE SONG! Has an R&amp;B edge. Upbeat and full of attitude.<br />4. Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman- Such a sweet slow song.<br />5. Boys- I'm not really fond of this one. It's good though. Has a diva like feel to it.<br />6. Anticipating- A fun, upbeat happy song. Very likeable!<br />7. I Love Rock and Roll- It's a good remake of the original! <br />8. Cinderella- I love this song! It's a fast paced song with a very danceable beat.<br />9. Let Me Be- A fun upbeat song. Great melodies and lyrics.<br />10. Bombastic Love- Great song! She does a little Nelly Furtado-type thing in the middle.<br />11. That's Where You Take Me- This is a really good song. It's a slow-paced fast song. Very sweet!<br />12. What It's Like To Be Me- one word...ATTITUDE! :) This is a stand-out song. Justin (her boyfriend) does some background vocals on it.<br />BUY THIS CD! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B000003GMQ|5.0|Perhaps saying Porcupine Tree is the 'best band in the world' is a little strong; they have some pretty strong competition out there. And I didn't say the best band of all time, because someday, perhaps somebody better will emerge. But if you are a fan of progressive, thoughtful, briliantly executed and flawlessly produced music, you will do no better than PT.<br />The early albums, ON THE SUNDAY OF LIFE, and VOYAGE 34, THE COMPLETE TRIP are very psychodelic in nature, evoking LSD trips and magic mushroom imagery, (I'm guessing, as I've never actually done that myself). Inevitable comparisons with Sid Barret and early Pink FLoyd will be made. In fact, the specter of Pink Floyd will follow PT's work through much of their catalog, including UP THE DOWNSTAIR, never more evident than in THE SKY MOVES SIDEWAYS, and up to SIGNIFY. It should be stressed that PT is not a clone band, trying to be like.... Steven Wilson has a unique and distinctive style that blends many influences, from techno dance, space ambient, progressive blues, and alternative rock; into absolutely brilliant compositions. The later albums, STUPID DREAM and LIGHTBULB SUN move the band further away from their influences and into their own catagory, by which other bands eventually will be compared.<br />I have been searching for a great contemporary progressive band for years; many of the offerings out there are good, but leave me unsatisfied and wanting more. Marillion, Spocks' Beard, Dream Theater, Flower Kings, etc... all good bands who, for me seem to fall just short of the mark. The old standard bearers like Yes, Roger Waters, King Crimson and Jethro Tull are still making some very good music (or releasing the same old music, like Floyd), but they don't seem to be able to capture the sparks that made them great way back when.<br />However, Porcupine Tree has fully pleased and satisfied my expectations with each new release. I find that I can't get enough and cannot wait for the next album. It baffles me that they are not better known in America - given their consistent level of excellent music, I would expect that Porcupine Tree would be a household name. Yea, as far as I'm concerned, they are the best band in the world today.les me that they are not better known in America - given their consistent level of excellent music, I would expect that Porcupine Tree would be a household name.

B00000DFSK|5.0|this  is   a    good  greatest     hits  cd    .      it  has  all   of   their    80s   hits.   but   the  cd  came  out   back  in   1998   .so   why   did  they  not   put     their   90s   hits   on   the  cd. . if  they   was    going   to     put  only     their 80s  hit      this   cd   should have  came  out back  in   1989.    this     cd    should    have   been    1980  - 1998.
B000002WPI|5.0|Well, when I bought this album I never heard anything by the Wu-Tang Clan yet so I didn't really had got any expectations but when I heard the album...WOW! It was great, it was like a total new world wich opened itself for me! The Wu Tang Clan really brought something new into hip hop, I can't really explain what but this album has something no other album has.... This is a classic, no doubt but it's not just that, this album is so much more than just a classic, it's ONE of the most important hip hop albums ever made! This is also defenitly the best Wu Tang album but you probably already knew! This album also doesn't have any bad tracks on it but the best are &quot;bring da ruckus&quot; wich has a great beat and thight lyrics, &quot;Da mystery of chessboxin'&quot;, &quot;Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthin ta f' wit&quot;, &quot;Method Man&quot; wich is my favourite Wu song and at last but not least &quot;Wu-Tang: 7th chamber - ptII&quot; (I like ptII better then the first, I think the beat is much better! This album introduced us to some of the best rapartists out there like Method man, odb, GZA, Raekwon... and almost all the others! So if you want a classic hip hop album wich means something in the game, I recommend you this album, even my mum likes it, and that ain't no joke!<BR>I'm out..
B00004ZD69|4.0|Is this pure, uncut musical genius, that should be leading our ears into the 21st century?  Or is this indie-rocks answer to Yes's &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;?  You decide.
0446608955|5.0|Sparks's novels are my favorite guilty pleasure.  I loved &quot;The Notebook&quot; and &quot;Message in a Bottle,&quot; but this one surpassed my expectations.  It is simply yet beautifully written, and the details are, as always, well chosen. Teens and young adults will especially appreciate &quot;A Walk to Remember,&quot; becuase the characters are high school seniors.  Sparks truly understands his female audience.  There isn't any steamy sex scene or exotic backdrop, but this novel will definitely take you places.  For me, the saddest part was finishing the book.  It was like returning home from vacation or finishing off a piece of chocolate cake.
0385505833|5.0|Not a typical Grisham novel (don't bother looking for the lawyers).  I couldn't stop laughing on my DC to SF flight.  When I got back I read it to my family and we all had a wonderful time.  A hellava funny Christmas tale.<br />Everyone knows someone like the Kranks and many of their neighbors on Hemlock.  It's funny, yet has some Grisham-esque twists as Luther and Nora battle the Christmas craziness head-on, and each other.  There's a very positive message of what Christmas is, and the whole family will enjoy this one.<br />Buy it, read it, you'll love it!

B000002HAJ|5.0|This is probably The Cure's best selling album to date, and deservedly so.  While those who remember The Cure when they were a relatively obscure band with a small but loyal following in the United States may find this album's popularity annoying, the artistry here is something not much seen in previous albums.  The music is classic Cure, not breaking any new ground, with driving rhythms and jangling guitar.  I guess it is the lyrics that set this album apart.  This is an extremely personal album for Robert Smith.  He goes beyond the typical melancholy of his usual songs and reaches to depths that produce pure heartbreak.  With &quot;Open&quot; he discusses his drinking problem, and &quot;Apart&quot; and &quot;A Letter to Elise&quot; appear to chronicle a failed marriage.  And while &quot;Elise&quot; and &quot;Friday I'm In Love&quot; received a lot of airplay (&quot;Friday&quot; I think even cracked the Top 40, a rarity for The Cure), the most underrated song on the album is &quot;Doing the Unstuck&quot;.  Getting past the goofy name, it is a perfect rendering of those emotions one feels when your life seems to be going to hell and all you wish for is that one perfect day with someone you love to forget all your troubles.  Thank you, Robert, for daring to share your wishes with us.  It is amazing how, with all our differences, people all wish for the same (sometimes impossible) things.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Where's the rock? Rock Steady is very synth-based, disco-y sound as compared to their guitar-driven previous albums.  They do however maintain their reggae roots.  Gwen is, as always,  the focal point of the CD, but this effort seems to have Gwen solo album written all over it.   Too many disco collaborations with other artists have spoiled poor Gwen.
B00005ATQM|5.0|The first time I came across this album was in the late summer of 1991 when it was released.I could still remember hearing it for the first time.Because of things I had read before in the press I was a little bit precaucious especially not helped by the fact that at the time I was living in my home country of Bulgaria.Anyway , when I first heard it I had already heard a couple of songs on the radio(Bulgarian radio is by no means as discriminating as the British one)so I decided I should buy it because I was so amazed by what I heard.Ten years later and we have it on DVD-Audio.I live in London and I had to buy from amazon.com because it's not available in the UK.Is it worth it?Yes , it is!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|A classic film.  A well done DVD by Disney.  It kind of, note the words kind of, makes up for other Disney classics on DVD with NO extras! Now, we just need Disney to release the others not released yet on DVD.
B000059MEK|1.0|what was going on in the heads of these people when they made this cd? i unfortunately bought discovery after hearing one more time, under the belief that all the songs were that good.  wow. i was so disappointed cause the rest of the album was unbeleivably bad. i learned my lesson - i will never again buy a cd without listening to all the songs on it first.
B00005KARK|5.0|One of my favorite Disney films!  And, like I am sure DVD fans out there will agree with me:  sure glad Disney put extras on it!!

MArtin had created so many twists unnecesserily. and the way he make my hopes fly sky-high and then let them just plumet again to the basement. not to mention how ridiculous some characters act, this made me want to (...)!!! it's like waiting for someone to dig his (or in this case her) own grave because she had to be stubborn. i can't stand it!!! if you like those books where you get to know lots of charaters really well and then wait for them to die one by one, this is your book
B00000K3CM|5.0|The best comedy sequels (witness &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;), do not attempt to change a winning formula, have the same characters, basically the same plot, and even the same situations - and that's why you love them.  While &quot;Home Alone 2&quot; loses none of the original's slapstick brilliance during a somewhat contrived re-location to NY, the message is rather more sickly, and it does not give the same warm, fuzzy, christmassy feeling of the original.  If you liked the original, predictably, you WILL love this.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Think you don't like LIVE albums?  This one will change your mind.  I've listened to this one over and over.  It's fantastic.  If you've never purchased a Sarah McLachlin CD, start with this one!  You'll be glad you did.
B00003CX5A|1.0|Christopher Walken is good but everything else (except the cinematography) (is bad).  Ricci seems to serve no purpose except to hold up her wig.  The screenplay is disjointed and pointless.
B000021XS0|5.0|possibly the greatest cd of our time.  and the sad part is no one will listen to it except for the die hard fans.  i think this is from the dumbing down of american music scene.  they just want manufactured pop music that has no substance to it.  and they care more about looks than what the music says.  my first dream theater disc was images and words just for the song metropolis part 1.  a great jam.  i have since bought a lot of stuff and i keep looking for interesting stuff on the music swap programs and in the record stores.  when i heard this i was floored.  could there really be american musicians that are this good and writing music and lyrics to make something this bombastic.  this has become a staple in my listening collection. i could listen to this all day and not get bored with it.  i just might do that.  the new live cd from new york and the video from that show are also great.  i have tried to learn the bass and drums for &quot;home&quot; and it is astounding how good of players they are.  this is not an album for the faint of heart.  it is a 78 minute roller coaster ride.  going up and down in speed, dynamics, and sound.  i give these guys a big thumbs up.  the music and lyrics are great.  james is a great vocalist, john and john are great guitarists, jordan might be one of the best keyboard players i have heard(and that includes derrick sherrinian) and mike portnoy could be the best all around drummer around.  my suggestion is to get this album and Queensryche &quot;operation mindcrime&quot; and just listen. ya dig.  up the irons!!!
078322947X|4.0|This movie is unique in the sense that it is NOT a typical, run of the Hollywood mill, saturated in sensationalism, unbelievabley witty, action flick.  This movie demands the audience's attention in order to fully appreciate it, but the rewards are great.  Driven forth by fear and by greed, four men attempt to drive 2 decrepit 6 x 6 trucks loaded with highly unstable dynamite over 200 gruelling miles through some of the most inhospitable terrain South America has to offer.  The trials they face are relentless...agony and sheer determination are written on the expressions on their faces, and very little dialogue is needed.  This is not about feelings or emotions -it's about survival and getting the job done, no matter what the cost.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and have viewed it several times.
B00005QW9V|5.0|Our angry Hedwig brought me to tears with her story, tears of joy as she tells the fairy tale of his/her life, leaving East Berlin for the United States to in the end only being at peace at last.<br />The subject is very interesting, very original indeed.  I was singing the songs after I left the theatre and bough the soundtrack two days after.  The movie is worht watching more than once, you would miss two many things the first time.<br />Check out the wigs, the costumes and listen to her jokes.<br />Have fun, and let me knwo if you agree.
080017948X|5.0|Groundhog Day is one of those movies that I just don't get tired of watching. Despite how good movies like Casablanca or Godfather or 2001 are, you can only watch those at certain times and only so often. However, with Groundhog Day I could watch it practically every day and not get tired. This is amazing since a lot of the movie is repeated as a result of the plot line. It is interesting to see how Bill Murray gets in control of his life and destiny by living the same day over and over again. If I was stuck in the same day over and over again, I would want to have this movie to watch!
B000002MU3|5.0|After releasing two highly soft/acoustic efforts with &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;, R.E.M. released &quot;Monster&quot; in 1994. Upon its release, it was hailed as an energized return to form, which proved that R.E.M. succeeded at anything they tried, always outdoing their competition. And yes, &quot;Monster&quot; is a hard-rock album...not something that R.E.M. had really done before. Sure &quot;Life's Rich Pageant&quot; and &quot;Document&quot; had a few loud moments, but the moments of loudness on those earlier albums are nothing compared to the many heard within &quot;Monster.&quot;<BR>You must also remember, this came out in 1994. Dead-center in what the media called &quot;grunge&quot; (although it was really nothing more than pure rock music that had a renewed purpose and meaning). There were several brilliant bands out there releasing hard-rock albums during this time: Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, Nirvana (Kurt passed on just a little while before &quot;Monster&quot; was released). All the way up through '93, R.E.M. had distanced themselves from these hard-rock bands by releasing quiet, introspective albums...so when R.E.M. decided to rock, no one could accuse them of &quot;just trying to get with it&quot;, simply because R.E.M. had been around MUCH longer than these other bands, and most of them hailed R.E.M. as a direct influence on their music anyways. So &quot;Monster&quot; was released right in the middle of a hard-rock craze...but it stands out (LIKE A SORE THUMB). Starting with the cover: a Bright-Orange backdrop with the black outline shadings of a bear on it. Then you have song titles that have never been heard before, and then just the name &quot;Monster.&quot; But what really matters here is the music, and luckily the material stands up to the album's title. Peter Buck's electric guitar tone is nothing short of astonishing, a completely unique blend of crunch, fuzz distortion, and delay. NOT A SINGLE guitar player's tone even comes close to his, in terms of individualism, sound, style, and creativity. And luckily, his guitar is the major backbone of this album. Second to Peter is Michael Stipe. His voice is in peak form here, as well as his lyrics. This time around, his main topic is the pathetic individuals who let themselves become consumed by power, money, lust, and sex. His melodies are as strong as they've always been, there is just a louder backdrop accenting him. Bill Berry's drumming is as precise as it always was, and Mike Mills' (although you can't really hear his bass) backing vocals supply an even bigger sense of power to the songs. <BR>&quot;What's the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;, &quot;Crush With Eyeliner&quot;, &quot;Bang and Blame&quot;, &quot;I Took Your Name&quot;, and especially &quot;Star 69&quot; and &quot;Circus Envy&quot; are the loudest, hardest-rocking, most energetic songs R.E.M. has ever done. Even the slower tunes (&quot;I Don't Sleep, I Dream&quot;, &quot;Strange Currencies&quot;, &quot;Tongue&quot;, and &quot;Let Me In&quot;) have a sense of urgency and energy that adds a new and interesting side to R.E.M.. &quot;Monster&quot; debuted at number 1 upon it's release in 1994, and was extremely popular (a lot of people bought it because of the hype that surrounded the release of the album, not for the quality of the music), but there appear to be a lot of R.E.M. &quot;fans&quot; out there who just can't seem to understand it. They can't accept the change from their prior albums' lighter side, to &quot;Monster&quot;'s hard-rock side. This is an example of close-mindedness. I guess because it takes a few listens to really absorb, people gave up on it too quickly (the same problem exists with &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; and &quot;Up&quot;, both excellent, but some people just don't understand experimentation and growth). It's a sad thing too, because they don't know what they're missing. So for the people who do understand it, ENJOY.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I've been a big Tomb Raider fan for years. Sorry folks, but lets be honest. This movie was one of the worst action flicks ever. Special effects were fair to good. Sound was fair at best. The story line would have made a good game level, but it didn't make it in the movie. The acting was fair. The DVD has a few special features, interviews, and commentaries. If you're still curious rent it first. Save your dollars.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I knew we were in for something bad with \\"Phantom Menace\\" when you look at what he did to the original trilogy a short time earlier.  Listen folks, all you need to know is this:  George Lucas has NO CONCEPT of what makes a movie good.  All he cares about is filling the screen with unneeded special effects, many of which are hard to look at because they stand out so much.  I will not comment on \\"Jar-Jar\\" specifically because it's no more ridiculous than the hundreds of other things in this movie.  Save you money.  If you want to buy your kids a nice \\"kids movie\\" I'd suggest \\"Toy Story(1 or 2)\\" or \\"Shrek\\".  Heck, I've seen Saturday morning cartoons that had tighter stories than \\"Phantom Menace\\".  (...)  I have to assume that \\"Star Wars\\" was a lucky accident for you.  Here's a tip for you:  look into making the next \\"Final Fantasy\\" instead.  (...)
B00005ATQI|4.0|I saw &quot;The Shining&quot; a few years back and am presently reading the novel; despite the former being based on Stephen King's novel, I see them in two entirely different categories. Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King are brilliant in entirely seperate ways. The novel is good and even though Kubrick changed a lot of things, I must say that the movie is equally good. It's sincerely creepy to it's credit. Who didn't feel a chill up their spine when Danny is riding his tricycle around with dizzyingly effective camera scenes only to come upon two twin girls in a hotel that is supposed to be deserted? And the ocean of blood cascading out of the elevator is sincerely creepy. Jack Nicholson's performance is nothing less than extraordinary and reading the novel I started out thinking it would have been better for Jack Torrance to have gone from nice with a bad temper to totally insane instead of all ready slightly off his rocker as portrayed in the movie, but you know what? It's Jack Nicholson, who with his sinister eyebrows and piercing eyes just wouldn't seem right in the role of a nice guy. I consider the Jack in the book and the one in the movie two very different people. Nobody else besides Jack Nicholson could have played Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's, &quot;The Shining, he's just so genuinely creepy and not someone you'd want to be barricaded in a hotel with. I would rather Kubrick hadn't taken such liberties with Wendy, however, who was described as blonde and lithe in the book; the total opposite of Shelly Duvall in the movie. She got the hysterics of Wendy down well enough, but I think an actress closer to the one in the book would have been better. The absence of the topiary scene is rather sad too because in the book it's genuinely creepy and I don't think it would have been too difficult to do as long as the audience had experienced the animals from Jack's POV since he never actually sees them move. Put in the rustling sounds and get someone to cut theanimals differently and it would have been a nice edition. Like I said though, the movie and the book are very different. Both the movie and the book are scary. I can see why Stephen King didn't like Kubrick's version since it strayed so far from the book, but I think of &quot;The Shining&quot; more as a movie LOOSELY based on a story written by Stephen King. Hey, it was done with &quot;The Body&quot;, a short story written by King, which became the cult movie &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. So if you see the movie and read the book, making comparisons is pointless because they vary in numerous ways.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Truth be told, I HATE when people call things &quot;classic&quot; because it's usually a word used to describe many things that don't deserve such a designation.  To call somehting classic, it has to have been absorbed so completely into society that it's essentially common knowledge.  Monty Python and the Holy Grail is such a thing.  If one doubts this, just go up to practically anyone and say &quot;I am Arthur, King of the Britons&quot; and I'll bet you 9 out of 10 will reply in falsetto female voice &quot;I didn't know we had a king!&quot;  Thus is the phenomenon that is Holy Grail.  This special edition delivers a great deal of additional fun as well, including a facinating tour of Holy Grail shooting locations from Michael Palin and Terry Jones, and the entire script can be superimposed as you watch(yeah, like we all don't know the lines already) Bottom line:  GET THIS DVD, and BRING ME SOME SHRUBBERIES!!!!!!  Or else...(you know!)
B0000024U8|5.0|Man, I just can't say enough good words about this album.  You just have to dig the sound, man.   I hear a lot of people getting down on steven stills for his work on side two--and hey man that aint too cool.  Like, season of this which really works, if you know what I mean.     Right on.
B00000DR8R|5.0|For me this album was the best of 84.  Since, I have always tried to identify what I consider to be the best album of the year and even after 17 years there is little that comes close to this.  Every track a gem.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I originally thought the movie was OK but not the great movie I was hoping for. However I don't think it is deserving of the harsh criticism in some of the previous reviews. I would cut some of the movie before the bombing because I think they achieved whatever character development were going to in about 45min and the movie is too long as it is.<BR>Personally I liked the Doolittle follow-on to the Pearl Harbor attack as at least it makes people aware of that incredible piece of history.<BR>The &quot;Making of the movie&quot; feature on the DVD helped me understand better what the writer/producer/director was trying to do. I was also impressed by the behind-the-scenes special effects presentation on the DVD.<BR>I think the plot came off as a little unrealistic because some of the plot is a patchwork of things that actually happened to real (but different) people, that in the movie was woven into only the main characters.<BR>The DVD includes short interviews of several sailors as well as a history channel documentary.
B00000G3PA|1.0|I can't remember a movie that I have disliked more than this.  I know it's Science Fiction, but come on.  You don't have to abandon all logic when making a film from this genre.  Anything in this movie resembling reality is purely coincidental.  It's predictable, corny, boring, stupid and just plain silly.  This movie would have you believe that oil workers can become astronauts in two weeks, NASA builds space drilling vehicles with machine guns on them, and Ben Affleck can pass as an oil worker.  Need I say more? The only highlight of the film, for me, was when Bruce Willis blew himself up.  If only it had been Michael Bay(director).  Then I would have given it another star.
B00005R2M3|2.0|We waited so long for a new CD from Shakira to come out and we get this uninspired collection. If this were Mexican food I'd send it back and get some Thai! My expectation was a powerful, breakthrough CD. Instead it's a string of so-so songs that don't seem to have any real drive. Who knows, the American public will probably love it. I heard her in an interview where she said that when she had dark hair people compared her with Alanis and now that she has blonde hair people compare her with Britany. Maybe she should shaveher head and be the (...) singer songwriter that we have all come to love.
0380002930|5.0|This is a great book! I statred this book at about 8:00Am at the begginning of school and finished by the end of school at 3:00PM (To do this, I completley ignored my schoolwork and concentrated on reading this book).<br />Basically, tis book is about a rabbit named Fiver, and when he has a &quot;premonition&quot;, 11 other rabbits join him, believing his fears to be true.<br />Otherwise, excellent book. Nothing objectionable and easy to read.
B00005RFVL|5.0|After performing only one time (too bad) in the Royal Albert Hall in London, this was a side we never saw from Robbie. He was a young boy when he went to a bar in his hometown to sing some of the old crooner songs. Now he does it again in style! This is a tribute to the old Rat Pack. And as a Sinatra/Martin fan I must say he does a very good job. This man can get away with almost anything. A cover of Queen's &quot;We Are The Champions&quot; on the soundtrack of &quot;A Knights Tale&quot;? No problem for Robbie. Watch the &quot;Supreme&quot; video of this artist and you almost believe he will be the next James Bond. And now he actually went down to The Capitol Studio in L.A. and recorderd this beauty. Listen to &quot;One For My Baby&quot; and discover the same piano player that recorded the song with Frank Sinatra. My favorite is &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;. You won't be disapointed if you buy this cd. Also watch out for the DVD of the performance. It has extra footage of the recording of this disc.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I think that this is a great family movie and we have already put our copy to great use! <br />The story is general enough for kids to get something out of it and parents should love the adult themed &quot;mini&quot; jokes too. We all loved this movie!
0780020685|5.0|I will not repeat all of the superlatives that have already been applied to this film or to the directors vision or the actors portrayal, they all defy description.  My only offering to this forum is time and space.  For a 3 hour movie it is amazing how time moves so swiftly that you don't notice it.  It is a well paced film that you can easily lose yourself in.  I cannot recommend it more highly than by asking how many of todays 90min hollywood movies would you wish to be 3 hrs long?  This film takes the full 3 hours and then when it is done you have no idea where the time went because you were so engrossed in it.  Even now after seeing the DVD version  7 or 8 times over two months I can still start it up anywhere in the story and be totally engrossed in the picture.  As for the space portion of my title, there must be a space for the DVD version of this film in any film viewers library that appreciates both world cinema and the origins of many of todays film techniques.  Along with Metropolis (science fiction), M (crime drama), and The General (comedy), Seven Samuari is a true cinema and world classic in every meaning of the phrase.
6300184080|5.0|Mask is one of those rare &quot;true story&quot; movies that remains that way when it hits the big screen.  It also houses an absolutely fabulous performance by Cher, as well as by Eric Stoltz.<br />Mask is about a boy named Rocky Dennis who is well above average in every way.  If it weren't for a degenerative disease that horribly disfigured his face since birth, the world would probably see him that way.  At first, those that meet him are understandably nervous and scared, but with an airy confidence, he wins his classmates and peers over.<br />That confidence comes from his mother, played by Cher.  She is an attractive, drug addicted single mother with an on again, off again fling with Gar, played by Sam Elliot.  Cher convincingly and movingly plays a mother riddled with insecurites, but in love with her son, who represents to her all she wishes she could be.  She was born with the huge advantage of being beautiful, she dropped out of school and got pregnant.  She lookes at Rocky and sees someone who was born with every disadvantage (a disfigured face and a short life) and who is confident, responsible, hardworking, and happy.  He is also valedictorian of his high school class. <br />Ever since she had Rocky, she has been strong and tough, making it clear that Rocky will not be treated any differently than anyone else.  Rocky takes from that confidence and gives it back to his Mom with the way he lives his life...getting up every morning, facing the world, being happy, taking care of himself, and preparing for and dreaming of a future that he may never have.  Her hatred for herself is transcended only by her pure love and open admiration for her son.<br />I have seen Mask a number of times over the years, but I have to say it gets me every time.  It is a movie that deals, realistically and truthfully with a disease that seems almost unreal.  But the lessons learned and the topics raised have little to do with the &quot;Mask&quot; and more about the connection between a mother and her son.
B000007OY0|1.0|Hey, sorry but it is true.  The Shawshank Redemption is nothing more but a modern day update of a 1930's prison picture.  Lets see....<BR>1.)  Innocent man sent to jail for crime he did not commit<BR>2.)  Crooked guards<BR>3.)  Malignant Warden who manipulates prisoners and the system<BR>4.)  Saintly fellow convicts who spout metaphysical wisdom like Grandpa on Walton's mountain.<BR>5.)  Edgy violence when hero is attacked by fellow inmates (supposed to show the terror of everyman).<BR>6.)  Hero appears to be co-opted by the system but then tiumphs  with a semi-spiritual redemption leading to the come-uppence of his tormentors.<br />That pretty much sums up the plot of Shawshank, nothing but a formula picture that you have seen before.  In that way I guess it is comfortable in that it breaks absolutely NO NEW GROUND, it is a re-hash of all the prison pictures that came before it.<br />Shawshank Redemption?  They should all get the chair as it has NO SOCIALLY REDEEMING VALUE to use the prison parlance.  After all the only message I got from it was that white collar crime pays if you are slick.
B00005QDW1|4.0|VERY different from any other No Doubt albums. I was expecting to hate it, and never listen to it again. It's actually a lot better than i expected. If you are really into No doubt, you should try it, but expect it to be totally different than anything No Doubt's put out. It's a little different than &quot;Hey Baby&quot;. It's very reggae (sp?) and funky. It also has some Return of Saturn sounding songs. Hella good is my favorite song.
B00003CXTF|2.0|I have not seen the movie Pearl Harbor since it first came out in theaters back in May 2001 and hadn't intend to write another review for it. But after a recent experience, I could not help myself from writing another review. <br />Recently, in my history class, we were discussing about how Hollywood changes events in history to make movies more entertaining and commercial. One person brought up Pearl Harbor, asking if Hollywood messed up the history or not. If I weren't so in control of myself, I would have gone off on that person! I told him that why should an important event in world history be toned down for a PG-13 rating and why we pay to see a three-hour love story that should have been a war movie. Being in a classroom full of MTV Generation morons who wouldn't know good movie making if it smacked them in the face, I was told by several people to shut up. But whose has the last laugh. <br />Pearl Harbor, admittedly, is entertaining. But shouldn't this event in our history be taken seriously? This could have been as realistic and brutal as Saving Private Ryan, but sadly it's battle scenes solely relied on CGI graphics, making it look more like a big video game. Then again, this is Jerry Bruickheimer and Michael Bay we are talking about (The same duo behind such loud summer movies as The Rock and Armageddon). Also, since it was unrealistic towards the attack, it defeated another purpose of the producers; to encourage young people to study more about the attack and to fin out the real truth behind the bombing. If that student in my class had read a book on the attack, he might not have asked if the movie was unrealistic. <br />There are several other problems with the movie. One of the big ones is the reasons why Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. In the movie, the only reason given was that the U.S cut off fuel supplies and trade. Japan decided to show the U.S not to mess with them.  If one were to study up on the attack, they would realize that Japan was invading islands and lands in the pacific. Thus, the fuel that the U.S was providing would have been used for the wrong purposes. The Japanese, who launched the air strike and thus brought the United States into war don't even have a big role in the movie. Even the title place of the movie doesn't have a big part, being only the mere backdrop for two young lovers. It is almost like using the World Trade Center, that is, on September 10, 2001. <br />One might call me a hypocrite, for I trash a movie like Pearl Harbor for lack of combat accuracy and praise something like The Longest Day, which has some inaccuracies in its view of the D-Day landings. But one also has to know that these movies were made in two different time periods: The Longest Day came out in 1962, a time when censors had more control over film content and thus wouldn't permit Longest Day's producers to show a bloody D-Day landing (This was also the era of the war epic). Pearl Harbor, however, has been released in a time of more leant censors and could have been the definitive movie of December 7, 1941. Instead, it was only made as the ultimate M.M.M (MoneyMaking Machine). When will Hollywood learn to stop cashing in on the dead?
0440234743|4.0|I'm a John Grisham fan, but even I was getting tired of the &quot;young lawyer running for his life while doing the Right Thing&quot; plots of some of his previous books.  This book proves that one can have suspense without violence or mayhem, and also proves that Grisham can write it well.<br />The book is very entertaining and a &quot;page turner,&quot; somewhat unexpected when one reads the back cover summary.  The main character's personal discoveries don't overwhelm the reader or the plot.  There is less law here than usual, but the law is the propelling force in the story.  The legal profession also gets a little better treatment here -- it's not black or white, corrupt or altruistic, but necessary and subject to fair interpretation.<br />The portraits of the heirs are, at times, hilarious.<br />I wish Grisham had done more with some of the subplots -- there's a lot of potential material there -- but the book tells its story well, and there's even a point to be made that a story can be told without revealing all to the reader.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is a great great film.<BR>The acting is superb and the special effects(although very simple)are wonderful.<BR>Its amazing how forrest managed to talk to Richard nixon,JFK and John lennon and they look exactly like they did at the time.<BR>The special features on this dvd are great with 2 deleted scenes and priceless footage of a young haley joel osment auditioning to play forrests son as some highlights.<br />This film is great and you absolutely nust buy it
B00003CXAA|4.0|The movie is really well done. In the day I got it I managed to watch all the set. Marlon Brando is acting as he was a mafia boss. No doubts that Al Pacino has been born to play in such role. However, this is too much close to the book, so I know what will happen and when.
0385505833|4.0|I laughed...and isn't it a wonderful life to be able to do that. It wasn't a deep story, it wasn't rocket science, it was just a fun book to read. And couldn't we all recognize some of the materialistic rituals that have become a part of Christmas that we all despise and wish we could say &quot;No, we're skipping Christmas this year&quot;. I may do that next year...and hopefully I make the cruise.
0345350499|5.0|I heard about this book from a employee at Borders books.  He saw that i had was buying Mad Merlin by J Robert King(another 5 star book) and he recomended &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; to read afterwards to get a different perspective of the story of King Arthur and Camelot.<BR>Who needs the big screen?  Marion Zimmer Bradley puts you in the story.  I really cared for the women behind the throne.  The story is brillantly written.  I read the book in 11 days at work, it takes awhile for you to get into the story but she captures you and you won't want to put the book down.  I was filled with emotions: sorrow, fear, happiness...Her descriptive words put you in the story, you don't need much imagination to read this book, she has done it all for you.  An excellant perspective in the tale of the great Arthur, Camelot, Merlin, Lancelot, and of course, the many women behind the making of the Great King.  A must read
B000006NXP|3.0|I purchased this CD with high expectations, given its &quot;legendary&quot; status, and found myself very disappointed.  I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  Kleiber's reading, while good, is hardly relevatory or even very engaging.  The fourth movement is particularly messy, given its overly frantic pace and sloppy finale (the coda practically falls apart at the end).  The sound from the Vienna Phil is terrific as always, but otherwise this recording seems rather manic.  I would pass it over for the Szell or Von Karajan any day.  And if you want legendary, get the Toscanini reissue.
B00005QDW1|4.0|There is a strong influence from the dance/rap community on this album (likely a result of Gwen's recent <br />collaborations with Prince, Moby, and Eve).  The first few tracks are in that vein (Hella Good, the lead <br />single Hey Baby) and Making Out sort of transitions the album to a more traditional No Doubt sound.  As <br />you might expect, the album is drenched in Gwen's unrequited love lyrics, though it's hard to tell who <br />they're directed at this time around, though it's certainly a lighter tone than before.  Musically they are doing some interesting things on this one, experimenting with mixing more electronica into their established sound and going back a little to some more dancehall as well.  No Doubt tapped some of the best producers in the business for this outing (Sly &amp; Robbie, Neptunes, William Orbit, Ric Ocasek, Nellee Hooper, Clive Langer) and sometimes it sounds overproduced as a result.  It's interesting that even though the use of different producers creates a wildly different feel to each song, they still manage to work as a whole.  Rock Steady also features some incredible guest performances, including Bounty Killer (on the lead single), and Prince on the beautiful Waiting Room.
B00005QAPH|5.0|I just got the DVD yesterday and I am so happy! First of all, it has the feel of a well thought out product. The packaging, the opening menu screen, etc. it just looks good. The bonus material, is extensive and interesting. But best of all, the picture is there. After thinking that my third generation copy on VHS was the only right way to watch this masterpiece, I now realize how wrong I was. The clarity of the images and the choreography of the camera and even focus pulling was all designed by Fellini for a reason and the DVD brings all of this new information back from the dead. Considering Fellini's constant struggle to be clear, I imagine he would have wanted it to be seen this way. I can't believe how good 40 year old film can look!<br />It's a must have.
B0000000LI|2.0|As part of the requirement to obtain a degree in music performance here at the University, we are required to study music theory and composition. Now, I'm no great shakes at theory, but now that I had a bit of an education, I thought I'd listen to my copy of \\"Acropolis\\" again and analyse it from a truly musical standpoint. I remembered the sweet intoxicating melodies, the lush orchestral textures...what could be wrong? I must say that my return visit to \\"Acropolis\\" was a disappointment...<br />Why is Yanni's music so bad? Well, for starters, it hardly ever modulates (changes key) and has little harmonic texture. Basically, it's appallingly simple. I can hear people screaming \\"b-b-b-b-but pop music is simple too!\\" Ah, but pop music (we're talking rock 'n roll, etc.) recognises itself as just that--pop music. Yanni and his devotees have the stones to call themselves \\"neoclassical\\" (seriously, I'm in stiches), and thus endow themselves with all kinds of pretensions. <br />Yanni does possess a talent for writing nice, catchy melodies (at one time he wrote jingles for commercials), and has been able to amass quite a following because of this (also take into account the promotion ad nauseum on PBS). Before you knock him, take into account the fact that Yanni has introduced countless people to the joys of classical music; people who otherwise would have never discovered Bach or Mendelssohn. <br />(...)
B00003CXDG|4.0|I must admit i am a huge John Woo fan, very biased. But in order to be objective i will say this is probably one of his worst movies. However to quote Sam Raimi \\"Woo at 70 percent is still going to blow away most action directors at 100 percent\\". I personally think he blows away all action directors. Now for my review. This movie has problems. The romance thing really (angered me). I know Woo wanted Romance but it did not work and has no real place for this type of movie. The romance should have been tacked on, not been a primary driving force. The car-chase thing togeter made even the die-hard woo fan in me gag. Totally silly. But with DVD magic you can fast-forward the scene. THe movie also takes too long to get the the first shoot-out in the lab. Way to long and should have been edited down. However besides the romance most non-action scenes work quite well as Woo with the help of great cinematography makes them more interesting then they are. Other good points are a good pair of bad guys, Dougray Scott and his henchmen. The movie does do a good job of setting up a believable rivalry between Hunt/Ambrose. The score was also excellent. And of course its John Woo. Yes his penhant for romance (isn't good) but his other trademarks like trenchcoats, sunglasses, two guns, explosions slow-mo etc. are always awesome when unleashed. It seems the slow-motion bothered many but not me, i think his timing for it is amazing and i was never bored except during the car-chase btw Ethen and Nya. His use of symbolism like doves and the firewalk bothered people too but me being a John Woo fan its just part of the fun of seeing his movies. Then of course there is the last 45 minutes of action with some great sequences. Personally my favorite stunt was the whole jousting scene between hunt and ambrose. Not realistic but no Woo movies are. Finally most hollywood action movies are pretty bad compared to this. MTV generation directors try to rip Woo's style but end up with action sequences that are very weak. I will take a Woo movie even when its not his best over bad hollywoodaction any day.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is the first DVD I bought after getting a DVD player, even though I already had it on video.  Enough said.
B00003CXSM|4.0|This movie is really funny and a movie you can watch over and over again.I reccommend this movie for teenagers or adults.This movie is worth watching.
B00003CXDD|5.0|THANK YOU GEORGE LUCAS!  I have long awaited to own this film.  When I saw it in 1989, I fell in love with it.  But then, they discontinued the film, and I was unable to own a copy.  I had to go to the local Mr. Movies rental, and I ended up renting it until the VHS wore out.  This left me with nothing.  I have long awaited a DVD and finally!  Lucas pulls Willow out of the treasure chest and blew the dust off the cover as he converted it onto DVD.  I bought this the day it came out and watched it twice in one night.  I was blown away by how much cleaner and sharper the picture is.  The sound is fantastic!  I was sweating when I was watching the DVD widescreen version for the first time on my TV.  The featurette on CGI Morphing is very interesting.  Sure, the 1989 version of the making of the film was a bit cheesy lazy, but nevertheless fun to watch also. <BR>Willow itself is one of the best fantasy films ever made, and to be put onto a fully loaded DVD only makes it that much better.  <BR>The carefully portrayed acting, the heart-warming score,  the eye-stunning visuals, and the tear dropping cinemetography turn the experience of watching Willow on DVD into the perfect fantasy adventure.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt releases their fifth studio, once again reinventing their stuff with a different style of music. No Doubt has never been classified as one type of music band; they're always trying different elements to please themselves and the fans as well. Once again, Rock Steady is no exception.<br />The album sucks you in with the beginning intro. We haven't seen an intro into a No Doubt CD since the self-titled back in 1992. Next up is a rock song about lust, &quot;Hella Good,&quot; which is the next potential single off the 2001 release. &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; a reggae/dancehall track, is the current single about boys and girls hitting on each other backstage at No Doubt's concerts. &quot;Making Out&quot; is a self-explanatory track, tinged with synthpop and disco elements.<br />Next up is &quot;Underneath It All,&quot; a love song that is definitely an album highlight. &quot;Detective&quot; is a ballad about a distrustful lover, catching her man with someone else. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; brings No Doubt fans back to No Doubt's classic new wave feel from previous albums (ie: &quot;Just a Girl&quot; from Tragic Kingdom and &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; from Return of Saturn). Personally, this is one of my favorite tracks from the new album. It's produced by former Car member, Rick Ocasak.<br />&quot;Start the Fire&quot; is a reggae song about beginning a new relationship and burning the previous, where &quot;Running&quot; is a ballad that sounds like an old Nintendo theme song, which is another standout track. &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; is a hardrock/new wave song, that can be compared to one that Garbage would do. &quot;Waiting Room&quot; is No Doubt's collaborating with the Artist, Prince. Another album highlight, as well as the title track, &quot;Rock Steady.&quot;<br />Overall, once again, No Doubt at their finest. They never fail to please the fans. A must buy for any fan of No Doubt or a new fan.
0790751305|5.0|I grew up the son of a man who adored Westerns. Nothing in my father's personality seemed to jive with Westerns, but he loved them. I was caught in the grip of this passion, and became a fanatic lover of the Western genre. I can't think of a Western I haven't seen. After seeing &quot;Unforgiven&quot; for the first time, I was staggered by the quality of the movie. I have seen it numerous times now and have come to the conclusion that it is the greatest Western movie of all time. The visual quality, the script,and the acting come together to make a superior movie. No one should miss this movie.
B00005QDW1|5.0|What can I start off with? No Doubt, one of the best bands of all time, has released their fifth studio album and it's exactly what everyone wanted. No Doubt went into a new direction once again, with some of their some of their old trademarks as well.<br />First, No Doubt shoots you into their world with the introduction to Rock Steady. We haven't seen a No Doubt intro since their debut album back in 1992. Next up is &quot;Hella Good,&quot; a rock song about Gwen's lust, which is most likely the potential second single for this album. &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; the band's current single, is about boys and girls hitting on each other backstage at No Doubt's concerts, behind a reggae/dancehall vibe.<br />&quot;Making Out&quot; is self-explanatory by the title of the song. It's a disco-tinged synthpop song about the anticipation of making out with the one she loves. &quot;Underneath It All,&quot; a reggae love song, is definitely one of the album highlights. No Doubt at one of their finest. &quot;Detective&quot; is a synthizer-filled tune about a distrustful lover, which is yet another highlight of Rock Steady.<br />&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;, produced by former member of the Cars, Ric Ocasak, is a new wave/punk song that everyone will love. It's got the old feel of No Doubt's songs in it (mostly &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; from Return of Saturn). This one was for all the fans of Return of Saturn!<br />&quot;Start the Fire&quot; was an okay song. A reggae-based tune about burning your relationship and starting anew. Nice story, but the song is somehow incomplete.<br />&quot;Running&quot; is another one of my favorite tracks on this album. A ballad which sounds like the band is playing in a musicbox or the song would be used on an old Nintendo game. Lovely song, which would make a great single or a great wedding song!<br />&quot;In My Head&quot; was one of the tracks that I wasn't too excited about hearing when I looked at the title, but I'm so glad they put this on the LP! It's one of the best tracks, which sounds like a circus song in some parts!<br />&quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; is a hardrock Garbage-type song, but with a touch of spice to make it simply No Doubt. This one was written for all those hard-rocking fans of Tragic Kingdom! These guys are great to us, aren't they?!<br />&quot;Waiting Room&quot; is the track that No Doubt collaborated with the Artist known as Prince, which is rewritten by him in one day. I think the verses work well. I really like when Gwen sings, &quot;You always had my number.&quot;<br />&quot;Rock Steady&quot; is the final track, with yet another reggae feel. I'm starting to love this song even more everytime I listen to the album.<br />All in all, a great album to add to your No Doubt collection and should definitely not be past up. If you're a longtime No Doubt fan, you'll love it. If you're a new fan, you'll also love it. Make sure you get this album.<br />Though, I hope No Doubt secretly works on another masterpiece like Return of Saturn, I love Rock Steady. Like the song says...<br />&quot;A real love survives; a rock steady vibe.&quot;
B00005QDW1|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with this latest CD. After seeing &quot;Hey Baby&quot; released I was worried that the new album would be awful yet I still held out hope that somehow through all this hype and media/fashion coverage of Gwen that perhaps No Doubt would stick to their roots as a blazing rock/ska group. However I got the album listened to them only to hear each song is pretty much the same phrase over and over. It sounds like Reggae meets the 80's. What happened to &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; and &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;? Why try to fix what wasn't broken?
0446608955|4.0|A Walk to Remember is a great book about a boy named Landon Carter that learns from a girl named Jamie Sullivan. He never spoke to her until his senior year when he needed a date for the homecoming dance. No one liked her at school because she carried her bible around everywhere and wore plain clothes. Jamie asked Landon to be in the play that her father wrote. They began to spend a lot of time together and they walked home together everyday after practicing for the play. They began to learn about each other. During their relationship, Jamie taught Landon the value of forgiveness. Jamie asked Landon what he wanted to do when he got older he did not know but she said she wanted to get married. Landon fell in love with her and then found out that she had a secret that only her and her father new about. She was dying and there was not anything to cure it. He new that she was going to die and he loved her so he asked her to marry him. As she walked down the isle Landon said it was a walk to remember. They got married and she died while holding Landon's hand at the age of seventeen. This was a sad but great book.

0821221841|2.0|Having bought, read, and studied Adam's original series, the revised edition is a dumbed-down version for the modern audience.  Though the newer books are good for beginners, they lack depth, detail and insights into serious B/W photography.  Okay for the beginner, but find copies of the old editions if you are serious about your photography.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|Let's face it:  Shrek is overrated. Don't get me wrong, the animation is spectacular, it's very funny at times and I enjoyed it enough to get the DVD. It does a fairly good job of skewering fairytales, but does so in a mean-spirited way. I suppose that that very irreverance is supposed to be shockingly funny, but for a movie that inspires to be a fairytale itself, it's the wrong way to go (for an example of how to do this correctly, see &quot;The Princess Bride.&quot;). Despite being a &quot;cartoon,&quot; this movie is not for children (do parents bother to check ratings anymore?) since its humor relies heavily on bodily functions, innuendo and mild profanities. The opening sequence pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie, as it should, in case you have any doubts.<br />Now on to the DVD content itself. As with most of their releases, Dreamworks has done a good job of loading the DVD with extra content, but I have to question the validity of the content. Disc 1 contains the full-screen presentation of the film and a featurette, but mostly it's full of a heap of DVD-ROM content. That's great if your computer has a DVD-ROM drive and uses Windows, but for everyone else it's an extra disc that won't receive much use. I understand that some of the DVD-ROM stuff is great, particularly the voice-dubbing studio, but I personally wouldn't know since I use a Mac.<br />While Disc 1 appears to be aimed at the new wave of DVD consumer (those who don't like letterboxing because they feel like they're not getting full use of their TV screen, among other things), Disc 2 is targeted toward the original DVD consumer (those who love the &quot;film school on a disc&quot; premise and will watch nothing but letterboxed movies). It contains a running commentary by the filmmakers that, while occasionally offering insightful information into the laborous animation process, is too often like listening to the geeks at the corner lunchroom table laughing and revelling in their very geekiness (I can say that because I sat at that table). The remaining content concentrates on the &quot;tech of Shrek,&quot; like storyboard pitches, computer glitches, character design, etc. This is nice, but left me unsatisfied since the presentation is somewhat half-baked.<br />If PDI/Dreamworks was going to try to copy the content of Pixar's &quot;Toy Story Ultimate Toy Box,&quot; they should have gone all the way. They should have released a basic DVD with perhaps full- and widescreen versions on the same disc, along with DVD-ROM content. Then they should have released a special, 2-disc set with as much technical stuff as they could cram on there. By releasing it the way they have, the content has been compromised. You might be attracted to this set by the box's promise of a cartoon for the kiddies loaded with special features (2-discs! 11 hours of content!), but the moral of the story is to not judge based on outer appearances; it's what's on the inside that counts.
0804106304|5.0|I challenge you to read this book with dry eyes.  In a beautiful web of joy and tragedy, Tan paints the landscape of the human soul.  This book is not only a testimony to Asian- American and woman power but a beautiful story of all people.<BR>At a powerful pace, Amy Tan catapaults from China to America, with never a dull moment.  In this journey, she tells the stories of four Chinese women and their Chinese- American daughters and their &quot;Joy Luck Club&quot;, a mah jong group.  The 8 players trade off chapters, telling their tragic, beautiful tales.<BR>We hear of the magic Moon Lady,of a concubine who kills herself to save her daughter's status, a child chess prodigy whose pride deystroys her game, of a woman forced to abandon her children and her other daughter who will soon be reunited with her lost sibings, and of how a brilliant young woman escapes her arranged marriage.<BR>Throughout the tragedy and despair these women feel, losing everything, not understanding their mothers, not understanding their daughters, all is knit together by a web of hope.  The free soul can surmount anything, and Tan's novel is a worthy read for all audiences.

B00003CXTG|5.0|This is the best movie, and even that's an understatement. It had everything...It made me laugh, cry, and I learned stuff along the way that I didn't before. The cast is amazing and the story line is perfect. I really loved this movie and I think everyone else will too. Plus, it had Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck, two major hotties, so it can't be all that bad, right?
B00005614M|5.0|Late in the 1940s a group of jazz musicians -- Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis, Kai Winding, Lee Konitz, just to drop a few names -- took to hanging out between gigs at a certain lower Manhattan coldwater flat.  That the renter of this flat happened to be arranger/composer/theoretician Gil Lewis gives, for jazz afficionados everywhere, whole new meaning to the term 'fortuosity.'<br />Evans was the spark; Davis (even then ever-restless, ever-questing) was the lightning rod.  &quot;Birth Of The Cool,&quot; ultimately, is the result.  (I use the term &quot;ultimately&quot; because the initial releases -- as with the &quot;Davis Nontet's&quot; live appearances -- debuted to less-than-lukewarm critical reviews.  All of which, for me, defines the value of jazz criticism as a whole.)<br />The collaborations of those coldwater flat sessions -- and this album -- were instrumental in the resulting careers of their participants.  Mulligan, particularly, would in this album give the lie to latter-day critics who tend to downplay his contributions as a composer/theoretician.  His comps/arrangements (listen closely to both &quot;Jeru&quot; and &quot;Venus de Milo), while obviously influenced by Evans' tutelage, demonstrate a deep study of -- and abiding respect for -- the musical idiom in which he chose to work.  The close-ensemble arrangements each of the album's various compositions, amplified by the sheer musicianship of all personnel involved,  furthermore, herald the movement of today's &quot;back-off-of-bebop&quot; movement. <br />This is an album which cannot be fully appreciated -- nowhere near so -- at first-listen; what happens upon further listenings, however, is likely to be sheer magic.  Even the (at-first) seeming incongruity of Kenny Harwood's vocal in &quot;Darn That Dream,&quot; upon subsequent listenings, shows a sure hand in its instrumentation.<br />An album for any serious jazz student's (or musician's) collection.
B00004YKUY|1.0|that this is the worst bluegrass album in the world! I don't hear a single banjo
0393312836|5.0|oh, woe is me... i feel really d'oh! for not getting this book earlier! honestly i've been thinking of getting it for years but never actually got around to it until i borrowed it from my college library early this year... what can i say?<BR>  the events in this book took place in the near future... and the world is a weird sort of place. the protoganist, alex is a really bad sort and well, he's really, really, and i mean *really* violent. the problem is, it's by choice. to make things interesting, he comes from a normal family (as normal as it goes; no history of violence, neither rich nor poor sort) and he basically has everything just fine... but, he's not fine. he gives a new meaning to the phrase 'bad to the bone'. not many authors write stories in which the main character is the evil one, and burguess does it without stereotyping that evil/bad ppl have no soul blah, blah, blah but he protrayed alex as a person who sees nothing wrong with violence, in fact, he crave it. now herein lies the problem - how to make readers sympathize with the character. that's the normal recipe for most book, but you know this is not just a normal book.<BR>  burguess is simply amazing, and i can't seem to stop sayng that. i'm not gonna go in detail on how alex wound up in prison, suffice to say, he was caught, incarcerated, but our clever alex found a way to beat the system and get his ass out from jail. how? by offering himself as a guinea pig for an experiment to eliminate evil from oneself... scary eh?<BR>  i don't condone any of alex's excesses, but i tell you, i found myself sympathizing with his dilemma. the experiment worked, amazingly and alex is 'cured'... but at what price? he is in constant pain because he can't even think of doing a bad thing.<BR>  the social dilemma here is not about alex, it's about how far society/government should take responsibility on its' youth and members. do we have the right to direct a person's most treasured possession - his mind - eventhough if it's for the greater good? how can we justify it as right? shuld we make the society mindless drones that are dictated by what we think is right? dare we play god?<BR>  alex, brave alex, lost his personality, life, loves, *mind* and was brought to the edge of sanity... that, is the most amazing thing about this book. it lets the reader sees things in a totally different way. burguess didn't make it easy for himself, he wrote the book using the worst character he could dish out and make us find some common ground with alex, and *pity* his predicament! incredible.<BR>  and many ppl are simply amazed by his invention of nadsat, the amalgation of russian and english that the kids of alex's generation. it was kinda hard to understand, but the book is totally worth the effort... read it.
0375757295|4.0|After reading Northanger Abbey, I decided to round out my Austen reading with Persuasion. About halfway through this book, I wasn't really thinking that it would be on the same level as the other Austen books (in my mind at least). I didn't feel anything much toward the characters or their situations. But the second half of the book changed my feelings and I grew more agitated reading it - will Anne and Captain Wentworth ever realize that they still love each other? There it was! I felt for the characters and their situations. And the letter Wentworth writes to Anne absolutely melted me. What girl wouldn't want to receive a letter like that!
B000001EKX|4.0|Out of the 10 songs on this album, 6 are still considered standards...My personal all time favorite song is on this album!<br />&quot;Let me go, Rock&amp;Roll&quot;  That song STILL ROCKS!  Some great songs are on this one....an overlooked Peter Criss tune, &quot;Mainline&quot;<br />and the classic metal jam &quot;Parasite&quot;, and don't forget the title track: &quot;Hotter than Hell&quot;.  A classic!!!
B00005NWRS|5.0|There may be a number of 2001 albums that &quot;glitter,&quot; but none of them are 'Gold.'  This is the Album of the Year, hands down!  I was really disappointed when I heard Adams was breaking up Whiskeytown.  In fact, to show my spite, I refrained from buying 'Heartbreaker,' and did not intend to buy 'Gold.'  By chance, however, I heard a couple of tracks and was immediately hooked.  The thing is, this is not just an extension of his Whiskeytown genius.  It is fresh.  It is different.  And, it is brilliant.  There are plenty of songs that will jump right out at you (e.g. 'New York,' 'Firecracker,' etc.), but the brilliance lies in some of the more subtle numbers like 'Rescue Blues' and 'Stars Go Blue.'  This album is a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone who appreciates music and longs for the days when rock 'n roll stars weren't supposed to be role models.
0385505833|4.0|This book is not one of Grisham's usual.  It's very light and quick reading.  It's funny and a joy to read at this time of year....Highly Recommended.
B00005QDW1|4.0|only one song on the album is more than just a chorus repeated over and over again! Don't get me wrong, I love the sound and I love No Doubt, but when you listen to the songs, they leave you wanting to hear the lyrics. It's like eating an amazing cookie that is missing the chocolate chips, or something to that effect. Anyhow, it's a great CD, but it might not be quite what you expected.
B00000IWVS|5.0|A number of people chastise Agerich for &quot;distoring&quot; or &quot;utterly destroying&quot; the subtleties of Chopin. I can't disagree with them. However, as this virtuoso performance shows, Chopin doesn't need subtlety to be brilliant.<br />Agerich pounds Chopin's music with great emotional intensity and rapt technical skills... it sounds like nothing else. I remain riveted by Agerich's utterly shattering interpretation of the Polonaise.<br />For good contrast, I suggest listening to Chopin performed by Maurizio Pollini (the Polonaises CD on DG is phenomenal) and by Authur Rubenstein (who brings a stringent aristocratic Air to Chopin's music.)
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I really mean it.  Every time I watch Shrek I find something that I missed before and I enjoy the movie more.  My 21 month old has picked Shrekn as her new favorite so I feel confident after 6 viewings in 4 days I can speak on this.<br />This is a movie that pokes fun at Disney, has the fairy tale ending and shows that inner beauty is all that matters.<br />I must say that the animation is wonderful; the computerized characters look real, not the cartoony way that cartoons (duh!) can look.  The picture quality is awesome, clear and sharp.<br />The extras on this DVD make this movie all the more enjoyable, for those who just gotta see how the animators did it there are goofs, a making of spot andthe best of all, the dance party.<br />This is one to own.  Run, don't walk and get your own copy.
B000006E4C|5.0|I own all three recordings of Music For 18 Musicians; I suggest that for anyone who is truly interested in the work, owning all three is a must.<br />In order of preference for me, the recordings go ECM, RCA, and Nonesuch.<br />No recording of 18 quite captures the piece as it sounds live. (I've had the luck to see it twice with Steve Reich &amp; Musicians at the San Francisco Symphony.) However, the ECM version comes close to duplicating the timbre of the real thing. To my ears, it sounds the most &quot;live&quot;.<br />The RCA/Ensemble Modern recording is perhaps the best performed. Ensemble Modern emphasizes Reich's earlier philosophies about music as a process; they clearly delineate the various instruments and lines in the recording, and they properly accentuate the lead mallet lines. (I say &quot;proper&quot; because that's what it sounded like when I saw 18 performed live.) What this recording lacks in lush beauty, it gains in near-academic perfection.<br />The new Nonesuch recording was designed from the ground up to be a recording, not a live performance. Most instruments are close-mic'd, which gives the odd feeling of standing next to all of the instruments at the same time. I love it for its open spaces, surprising tempo, and stunning imaging of the mallet instruments. It is as lush and beautiful as the ECM recording, but I prefer the subtleties and pacing of the ECM more.

B00000255F|5.0|&quot;Born To Run&quot; was THE album that finally fulfilled the promise of the preceding 20 years of rock history and pointed the way to the next 25.  It is impossible to overstate the impact this record had on a rock scene that had been so vital and energetic in the late '60s but through corporate influence and the corruption of big money had grown bloated, stale and anemic by the mid '70s.  With this album, Springsteen almost singlehandedly obliterated the widespread consensus (prevalent especially among older Boomers) that rock was dead - i.e., that it would never be original, exciting or meaningful again.  Springsteen puts together all the pieces:  teenage restlessness, young love and heartbreak, inchoate social awareness, and of course the exhilaration and danger of the open road.  If I had to choose one song that would define rock for all time, the title track of &quot;Born To Run&quot; would be it.

B00005K3OT|5.0|This is the best movie!   It has a fairy tale like quality that will charm anyone.  Just be prepared to make a chocolate run right after you watch this movie!  Better yet, surprise your hunny with this DVD and spend a romantic evening curling up together with some chocolate mousse.
B000000OSE|5.0|If a true lover of hard rock can get past this band's silly antisocial antics and some potentially offensive (to some) lyrics, what you will find is a treasure of composition that has few equals in the genre. First, I disagree with those who label G&amp;R as a heavy metal band. I have my heavy metal favorites, but G&amp;R are a cut above them all in the quality and range of their composition. Some of the best tracks &quot;The Garden&quot;, a searing metallized ode to disenchanted love; &quot;Don't Damn Me&quot;, an in-your-face angry rail against conformity; and &quot;Coma&quot;, a cry for tranquility and detachment that takes you on a wild roller coaster ride of cerebral melody and pounding metal, never made air play because of their sometimes &quot;R&quot; rated lyrics or play length. As a landmark album for its time in that it has a style and quality unlike any of its contemporaries, I would rank it, along with UYI-2, on the same level as Led Zepplin's Physical Graffiti. 1 and 2 should have been marketed as a single release because of the spectrum of musical taste that they encompass. Together as one album they would have been one of the greatest albums in classic rock history. It is fitting that these albums recorded at the band's zenith and were released in the wake of their rapid decline. They represent the best efforts of the band <BR>and show how the band seasoned from its cruder but no less effective debut &quot;Appetite for Destruction.&quot; As a fan, I'm grateful the G&amp;R departed after they recorded their best, because they were still fresh and innovative. They didn't get sucked into the recording industry trap of being forced to crank out the sub-standard commercial grade fodder that so many talented bands fall into.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I saw the movie once..twice..three times and i still cant get enough of it. I cried, laughed and was angry all in one movie. I loved it and i would recommend it to anyone who likes war movies and love stories, like myself.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you have seen the movie, this CD is a must.  It is definitely on the the best soundtracks out there!
020530902X|5.0|It was the night before the PSATs. I was a good student and cramming would help no more, but one thing worried me. I didn't have any preparation for the SAT II Writing Section. Managing to read this in between playing video games and lunch, I wound up with a 740 on my SAT II Writing Section. This is definately a classic and a jewel.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I was convinced that The Strokes sounded uncannily like The Velvet Underground, but when I brought it up with some friends of mine, they didn't hear the similarities.  I'm listening to Is This It? right now, and I keep thinking of VU songs like &quot;I'm Waiting for the Man&quot;, &quot;What Goes On&quot;, &quot;Beginning to See the Light&quot;, &quot;Lisa Says&quot;, and &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, to name a few.  The VU is my all-time favorite band, and those are some great songs, so I'm definitely enjoying Is This It?
B00002SWEM|5.0|If you have already become familiar with the beauty that is the Buena Vista Social Club, you know what to expect.  If not, I'll hopefully give you just an idea of how incredible this truly is.  It is a pretty tough thing to do however, for words do not adequately capture the feeling.<br />Something to try...get a good cigar.  Try a nice Ashton, Dunhill, Victor-Sinclair, H. Upmann, Punch, or...if you have good sources,  or crafty customs techniques, an always incredible Cohiba.  Next, pour yourself a very good glass of rum, on the rocks.  Any adult beverage will do, but this one just sets well with the cigar and the atmosphere.  Then, open all your windows.  True, this only works well if you are in a decent latitude.  Next, pop in this dvd.  Enjoy.<br />This is pure beauty.  I discovered the BVSC many years ago, and after first having purchased the BVSC cd, I was COMPELLED to get everything I could get my hands on.  So, along came the releases from Compay, Ibrahim, Omara, Cachaito, Rueben, Afro-Cuban All Stars, etc.  I purchased each and every one, as well as all the subsequent releases.  Compay for instance now has 3 out.  Reuben has 2.  Afro-Cuban have 2 as well.  And a blessing it is.  I pray they continue to pour out the releases.<br />This DVD is the PERFECT visual companion to the cd.  It causes one to FEEL the music that much more.  To know that these are musicians who LIVE what they sing.  They KNOW it.  They are still living in it.  The documentary allows you to become that more a part of what you are hearing.  Then, once you watch this, when you listen to the cd's, you feel that much closer to it and it's much more a part of your soul.<br />It's a dvd filled with concert footage and behind the scenes recording footage.  It's filled with images and interviews on the streets of old Cuba....perhaps that's a bit redundant.  At any rate, it looks like, amidst the crumbling buildings and streets, like Cuba is frozen in time.  Ever since the day of the embargo, things haven't changed.  This is incredibly wonderful and incredibly painful at the same time.<br />Definitely get this dvd.  Definitely get all the cd's you can.  Be careful of BVSC imitators out there however.  As many others have tried to cash in on these artists.  However, be on the lookout for the many artists that actor Andy Garcia is working with and releasing on cd.  He is, remarkably, an incredible trumpet player and is taking painstaking efforts to preserve the same musical heritage as is here.  Also, anything in the &quot;Cubanismo&quot; series is without fault.  Definitely worth looking into.<br />Now, definitely try to act out what I have set forth above.  Add to it a Guyaberra shirt (in your favorite color) and a dancing partner.  Then, roll back the rug on the terrazo floors, and enjoy life.ings haven't changed.

0800132343|5.0|This great film, which I originally watched in German, is fantastic. This has to be the best W.W. II Sub film ever made. We follow a German crew on a single mission... Very intense and action filled. The Director's Cut DVD offers vast improvements via re-mastered sound and a crystal clear picture. There are 60 or so minutes of extra footage bringing the length of the movie to well over 3 hours.
6303675212|1.0|If you are looking for a colorized version of the original 1947 classic -- THIS IS NOT IT! This is a &quot;new&quot; remake of the original.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I love Cameron Crowe.  'Say Anything', 'Jerry Maguire', and 'Almost Famous' are all deeply moving films showing a film maker learning and improving on his craft and his storytelling with each year.  My only complaint was that before seeing Almost Famous I started hearing rumors about a longer, richer cut of the film.  It took an edge off the original experience.  I found myself noticing jumps in the storyline.  Character were left unresolved that needed to be resolved.  I just wanted more!  Now it's here, and it was worth the wait.  The DVD fills in all the holes, and leaves me waiting for a release to the big screen in ten or fifteen years.
B000001Y79|5.0|This is a killer CD from No Doubt- topping Return of Saturn, in my opinion- and I've yet to listen to all of Rock Steady, so, currently, this is my favorite No Doubt CD.<BR>The songs on here are pure ska, funk, reggae, pop, dance mixes that are outstandingly No Doubt. When speaking of No Doubt, I would give someone the CD and then say, &quot;Here. Listen. Learn.&quot;<BR>The guys are excellent musicians, and Gwen is a truly talented singer. The guys admire her looks, we girls admire her voice. It's a win-win situation with her. <BR>Some of the best tracks on the album include &quot;Just a Girl&quot; which is oustandingly Female. It's quite the song- as is &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, a really good tune to listen to. However, the best song (in my opinion) has to be &quot;Don't Speak&quot;, a tragic breakup story. You can see the lyricist agonizing over what to pen next...up late at night with their head in their hands, thinking over and over again: &quot;Don't Speak/I know what you're thinking......don't tell me cuz it hurts.....&quot;<BR>All in all, a truly great effort from No Doubt- really really good!
0385505833|2.0|I like John Grisham, and, while not deep or probing, his stories are fast paced, interesting, and entertaining.  Also, he usually does a pretty good job of character development.  This short book had a couple of humorous lines and a lot of annoying situations.  You already know from other reviews that it is predictable but who cares if it's fun along the way.  This is not fun!  In fact, it is so often irritating that I had to frequently get away from it.  This 177-page book took forever to finish.  Luther and Nora have so little respect for each other that the prospect of them spending 10 days on a cruise ship together is horrifying.  The daughter, Blair, is simply a self-centered spoiled brat, even though she is described as being &quot;loved by everyone.&quot;  The neighborhood sounds like a place that anyone with more than a two-digit IQ would run from.  None of it makes sense.  The final (and predictable) act in the book is sweet, however, but definitely not worth the work.
6304708521|4.0|If nothing else, this 'movie' has some of the best musical sequences ever. 'I Am the Walrus' is hilarious and 'The Fool on the Hill' is one of the few instances where Paul was actually cute. 'Blue Jay Way' is strangely entertaining, especially for me, a George fan. 'Your Mother Should Know' is funny, especially watching John fall over at the end and Ringo stepping out of the beat (Ringo! You're the drummer! Get it right!) 'Flying', admittedly, freaks me out, but I still like the tune itself.<BR>However, the rest of the movie is not up to par with 'A Hard Day's Night' or 'Help!' There are funny bits and I enjoy the irreverance, but the lack of any scenes with  George, my favorite Beatle, rather pissed me off, to say the least. In truth, he has six lines of dialogue in the whole movie, while Ringo talks nonstop the whole time. John narrates and Paul is basically in charge, but George seems to linger in the background.<BR>Otherwise, it's quite clever and despite it's lack of plot, enjoyable. But....more George!
0451527712|4.0|I am an eighth grader that chose this novel to read for my English,  it is one of the few books that I actually enjoyed, this book is a classic example of a horror tale, (it may not satisfy the horror book lover who reads Stephen King), it was one of the first books in the modern \\"robot\\" genre, a fictional autobiography of a man so obsessed with creating life, that without thinking of the consequences, he toils day and night wandering around graveyards, collecting material for his horrible deed and working in his lab, anxiously awaiting the completion of his horrible project and finally when it is completed.... O.K., I don't want to give away the whole story. I do want to say that this book lacks a great amount of detail as to how he was doing his horrible deed, but probably if it did, in Shelley's time, it wouldn't have been published. I also want to add that at times the book drags on as Frankenstein is telling about his remorse for the creation of his \\"wretched abomination\\", but not alot of times. I also want to add, for the ones of you reading this who saw the movie, that the book is totally in every way different than the movie, which drastically modified Frankenstein character, added some new ones (Igor) and changed the setting.
B00005QDW5|5.0|For some reason I like to read the reviews of the albums that I enjoy most. Maybe I just enjoy reveling in how misinformed the negative opinions can be. In this case, I agree with all of the &quot;pro&quot; ratings. My only gripe is that nobody has talked about the amazing job the producers did in re-mastering all of this material. This collection represents a phenomenal bit of engineering that is worthy of the advanced output that Waters and company have provided throughout the (many) years.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Others have said enough about how good this CD is.  I can't add anything new. But, I wonder whether anybody also finds the first track irritating (4 1/2 minutes of axes chopping wood).  I now start listening from track 2. Even then, this is an absolutely marvellous CD, which opens my eyes to a music genre I knew little about.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I first bought this title on VHS and enjoyed it very much except for the audio quality.  When I saw it in DVD it was an easy decision to add this to a collection worth archiving.  The DVD is far superior in audio quality to the VHS. One can actually understand the rapid style of speech and the words are far clearer in the important moments where the plot line is revealed.<br />It is a sweet story of a &quot;spinster&quot; who is forced to bypass two offers of marriage by an interferring socialite neighbor who has placed herself in the advisor role since the death of the girl's mother.  Ann Elliott is pale, withdrawn and very sad as she watches her life pass her by, lost in regrets over refusing the hand of a man she truly loved.  The socialite wants her to marry a cousin who has another agenda entirely.<br />The story unfolds as her lost love, Captain Wentworth, reappears in her life and one watches a very gifted actress, who is a member of the Royal Shakespearean Theater in England, literally come to life again as she reawakens to the love lost and the promise to regain it.  Watching her transform from drab to glowing is simply wonderful in this engaging story of the eternal quest for love and being loved.
0783216084|5.0|This was a giant of a movie from Stephen Speilberg. The actors<BR>who starred in this movie ,Roy Scheider,Robert Blake,and Richard Dreyfus added to the quality of this movie.

The shark is truly a monster.The special effects in this movie add to the scary influence of the<BR>monster shark. There are many struggles with the killer shark.<BR>The ending of the movie is truly worth waiting for.This is an<BR>outstanding movie that you will indeed enjoy watching. Classic<BR>is the perfect word for this movie.
B00005MP58|5.0|This age old story of arrogance, false pride and prejudice toward others less fortunate, both financially and emotionally,  is wonderfully told in this charming costume drama. The quality of the DVD is far improved over the VHS edition, and it is well to note that it will not erode over time as does tape. <br />Jennifer Ehle is exquisite in her role as Elizabeth. She is fascinating to watch as she unfolds her own pride and predjudice toward an erstwhile suitor whom she secretly loves but cannot allow herself to admit. What can anyone say about the wonderful actor Colin Firth, but praise?  He is a powerful, virile and elegant Mr. Darcy. The onscreen chemistry between these two actors, Firth and Ehle is palpably remarkable.  To this viewer the only character who is over the top is her shrieking mother Mrs. Bennett.  There are a few moments when she is so intense that the mute button on the remote control is essential. The actor who portrays the pompous, officious Mr. Collins is simply<br />outstanding in his role as is the balance of the cast who bring to life a story and the many quirks of character, personality and the motives that drive each of them.  <br />All in all, the DVD is a cherished addition to a select archive of favorite films that are reviewed every 6 months or so for another hit of Colin Firth.

B00005UKE0|5.0|One of GH's best albums, from the music to the lyrics not to mention the great musicians who are in the record.  Powerfull album with a message which has serve as an inspiration all these times.  The reissue still comes fresh and ageless, the very aspect of a great record (checkout the bonus stuff).  A must have collection from George.  Thanks for the music and the message, hari bol spirit soul, hari bol George.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This is the most Beatle-esque thing Sir Paul has done since, well, The Beatles. The final cut, \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" and the bonus track, \\"Freedom\\" are worth the price alone. This guy is- what, 62 years old?- and still manages to sing like Little Richard at age 20! The drummer's name is given as Abe Laboriel, Jr., but with some of the fills he does, I'd swear that's a pseudonym for Ringo. (...)this is the best thing Paul's done since Tug of War. Buy it and listen to it often. You'll dig it.  (P.S., The censors at Amazon.com are real (...).  The full title of my review reads: In the World of Rock and Roll, Paul McCartney Can Still Kick Your (...)!  Surely, boys and girls, you're not trying to make this a Disneyesque, G-rated websight?  If you are, then you'll soon find you've lost a customer...)
B00000J6AG|4.0|I just got this CD, and what a beautiful experience it is listening to it.  Leaning back in my easy chair, closing my eyes, visualizing the abstract imagery of each song, and gradually dozing off, it is not an insult to say that this CD put me to sleep.  Well, not to sleep exactly; just a quiet, warm, peaceful frame of mind--a comfortable twilight.  Moby's PLAY is like a perfect marriage of Enigma and Fatboy Slim: it's new-age techno. :)<br />If my description sounds appealing, then you will most likely like this CD.  In fact, you might love it. I can't say I love it, but I do like it--a lot. One thing on it I do love is the duet between Moby and Gwen Stefani on &quot;South Side&quot;. I definitely recommend this CD.  Moby is cool!
0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; is a modern, anti-war classic.  It is the story of Billy Pilgrim and his problematic life marred by his horrific experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden during World War II.  There, Billy experiences firsthand the catastrophic fire bombing that leveled the German city.  The reader jumps back and forth to different points in Billy's life, many times randomly and unexpectedly.  All of it adds up to a darkly (yet humorously) told story of a sad, existentialist life.<br />I must say that I, as a Believer, have a different worldview than Kurt Vonnegut and Billy Pilgrim.  But this book is so very honest about what everyday human life must mean if there is nothing more than fire bombings, dogs barking, family members, dreams of trips to imaginary planets, and so on.  If what we see is all there is, as many of us, with our actions and beliefs testify to frequently, well then, as Vonnegut writes, &quot;...so it goes.&quot;  The only thing we can do to cope is deny the fact and create our own subversions, unless we truly want to open ourselves up to something our very nature tells us from which to run.<br />&quot;So..&quot; said Billy gropingly, &quot;I suppose that the idea of preventing wwar on Earth is stupid, too.&quot;<BR>&quot;Of course.&quot;<BR>&quot;But you do have a peaceful planet here.&quot;<BR>&quot;Today we do.  On other days we have wars as horrible as any you've ever seen or read about.  There isn't anything we can do about them, so we simply don't look at them.  We ignore them.  We spend eternity looking at pleasant moments--like today at the zoo.  Isn't this a nice moment?&quot;
B000002AP1|5.0|Raw Power is the second greatest punk album in the world, next to London Calling. This is what punk rock is all about: playing loud, playing fast, making violent, angry music, lashing out at the world, basically being punks. Iggy Pop is without a doubt, the Godfather of Punk and is punk's greatest frontman. (Though the Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten certainly comes close.)<br />However I have one complaint. If Iggy attempted to improve this album by making it sound worse, he certainly failed. The sound is certainly poor, and makes the album a little less listenable. However if you enjoy fast, loud, and angry rawk with no hint of pop sensibilities then this is for YOU!
B00004TX5F|5.0|This sensuous and beautiful work is for those who are not easily shocked; who love the beauty of opera and the human voice; and who don't mind a bit of experimentation.<br />The mixing of the two voices (soprano and heldentenor) to approximate the range and power of a castrato singer is beautifully done and beautifully enacted in this film.<br />Get the DVD and watch it with your lover!
0684857219|2.0|All pictures are great except for the exercises. They are too old fashioned and dangerous., But there are some excercises that are safe.

I'm a personal trainner and I won't let my clients suffer from shoulder problems doing behind the neck press and behind the neck pulldowns.) So, think twice before buying this book.

B00003CXTF|3.0|Historically, this may be better than Titanic, but not by much.  While I am pleased to see some of the stories of some of the things about World War II get introduced to a new couple of generations, I know that most of the things involving the lead characters is falsely portrayed and Hollywoodesque.  I did give my students a recommendation to see the movie so that I could use what they saw as a guideline, but I found myself often wishing that I hadn't due to the misperceptions and inaccuracies I saw historically.<br />As entertainment, it may be, but I could not divorce myself from my feelings of annoyance knowing what I saw was not always the true story.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie has everything!, Kung fu, lots of guns, sci fi and most important; a cerebral plot. The acting was fine, especialy Carrie Ann Moss, her character trinity is the ultimate female action hero, very tough but very sensible too. The production design and the special effects are terrific!!, And the dvd has a great image and sound. This movie is far better than Episode 1.

B00003CXXS|2.0|Special effects are good but how many of these trite movies need to be made? I started rooting for the dinosaurs immediately in this one, not mid-way as in the first 2!What we all could do with a well written movie involving dinosaurs and the great special effects that are available. Please enough is enough, and really are there no insects in this jungle? It would seem to me that bug bites and stings would be the most frequent attacks that anyone would face.
B00003CX5P|5.0|To tell the truth, I did not expect that George Lucas will make DVD till 2005. When I have seen the announcement on this disk, I have not believed the eyes. What I can tell about it DVD? Work on creation of a disk has gone right. Fine video, an excellent sound, good comments. It is looked on one breath.
B000002A3T|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I *ABSOLUTELY LOVE* the authentic Pink Floyd.  They were the first band I ever connected to, my first concert, and my first *musical* obsession.  In middle school I saw \\"The Wall\\" over one-hundred times, and except for my tendencies towards primal screaming, ripping my fingernails out, shaving my eyebrows and chest, leading a maniacal facist skinhead goon squad and then ending up reading weird poetry in a toilet stall in the bathroom of a hockey stadium, I'm no worse for the wear!    Anyway, I remember hearing the first strains of \\"Keep Talking\\" the day it was released as I stood out in the cold winter air, waiting in line to purchase tickets for their '94 concert tour (I was successful).  My feet were numb (and not comfortably!).  I didn't think the song was that great; more like a cheap knock off, not even of classic PF, but perhaps AMLoR-era PF.  A loyal fan and consumer, I bought \\"The Division Bell.\\"  Try as I might, I simply couldn't bring myself to accept this music.  Last night I decided to give it another shot, start to finish.  This experience only confirmed one thing: this is their very worst album.  Gilmour and his friends are really sub-par lyricists, and the lyrics are obviously meant to ape the themes found in Waters-era recordings.  Do you think David Gilmour was really all that concerned about talking and intimacy, or he and the boys needed an excuse to tour and make bajillions of dollars again (I paid thirty-five bucks in 1994!)?  The very lowest point is the horrible, horrible, 'ORRIBLE piece by Richard Wright.  The guy is among the most boring singers I've ever heard, and I haven't heard lyrics that awful and trite since the last time I heard Lenny Kravitz's \\"Dragonfly,\\" which thankfully has not been for a long time.  There are some nice moments (and I do mean moments, like two or three-second snippets) here and there, but all in all, Gilmour's playing is nowhere near as ferocious as it was on WYWH, Animals, or even Momentary Lapse of Reason stand-out tracks like \\"Yet Another Movie\\" and \\"Sorrow\\" (one his best moments), and his voice isn't as honey-sweet and pure as it used to be.  Then there are all the obligatory Floydisms: sax, female singers, distant voices from conversations or movies and the like.  Couldn't they have done something original?  I've read that upon hearing \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" Roger Waters called it something like \\"a clever, quite facile forgery,\\" and I agree.  Even that recording used some Floydians cliches just to maintain an \\"authentic\\"  atmosphere, but at least that album wasn't awful through and through.  \\"The Division Bell,\\" like \\"Star Wars, Episode One,\\" is a disappointing example of totally formulaic drivel.  If you're a Floyd fan and this CD gives you some sort of deep satisfaction, then you must be a total lunkhead, because in even the most objective sense this album absolutely reeks.
B00005QXXO|4.0|First, my complaints..<br />1) Nothing compares to the actual live show.  This of course is a dilemma that musicians have been facing for quite some time, but it should be noted nevertheless.  Idioteque is particularly unrepresentative of the live experience; although it is an enjoyable recording, the visual elements and raw emotion on display at the concert can not be duplicated on CD.  <br />2) Where's OK Computer? I'm a fan of everything Radiohead has done, and would have liked to see a broader scope.  <br />3) The sound quality is good, but could be better.  Idioteque is a bit muddy, and overall it is not as bright as it is live.<br />However, despite all this, it's still worth the money.  I Might be Wrong is better than on Amnesiac, Morning Bell is AWESOME, and True Love Waits is a great song you don't hear too often.  Above all, Spinning Plates is just astonishing.  It will make you cry if you let it.  <br /> I'd like to see more live recordings - it seems like they'd be relatively inexpensive and convenient to produce and distribute - but with a broader range of music.  A full concert recording would be best.
B00005QDW1|5.0|If you've heard &quot;Hey Baby&quot; then you know what to expect from this album. Yes, there are dancehall inspired tracks but overall this album is much more keyboard / sequencer oriented than almost any other single song recording in the band's career. In fact, there's really only a couple tracks which sound at all &quot;rock&quot; comparable to the band's last record, &quot;Return from Saturn&quot;.<br />That said, the grooves and hooks on this album are vast and numerous. The shake-your-booty anthem &quot;Hella Good&quot; is another monster single to rival the excellent &quot;Hey Baby&quot;.<br />It is time longtime fans realize that No Doubt is no longer a Ska band. But, in the 21st century music climate, that is not a bad thing at all.<br />I didn't think any album could top &quot;BeautifulGarbage&quot; this year, but &quot;Rock Steady&quot; does it!
B00005QXXO|4.0|First, my complaints..<br />1) Nothing compares to the actual live show.  This of course is a dilemma that musicians have been facing for quite some time, but it should be noted nevertheless.  Idioteque is particularly unrepresentative of the live experience; although it is an enjoyable recording, the visual elements and raw emotion on display at the concert can not be duplicated on CD.  <br />2) Where's OK Computer? I'm a fan of everything Radiohead has done, and would have liked to see a broader scope.  <br />3) The sound quality is good, but could be better.  Idioteque is a bit muddy, and overall it is not as bright as it is live.<br />However, despite all this, it's still worth the money.  I Might be Wrong is better than on Amnesiac, Morning Bell is AWESOME, and True Love Waits is a great song you don't hear too often.  I'd like to see more live recordings - it seems like they'd be relatively inexpensive and convenient to produce and distribute - but with a broader range of music.  A full concert recording would be best.
0783117388|5.0|Any one who knows me, know how I feel about SAC.  The show is real and extremely funny!  It's not just a chick show...I mean, it is, but you guys will love it too. But be warned, SAC will blow the lid off your scandalous ways!
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt is my all-time favorite band, and has been for awhile now. My favorite CD is Tragic Kingdom. I picked up Rock Steady today, a little bit iffy on how it was going to sound. I liked Hey Baby, but not as much as their older stuff. I was blown away by the CD. I loved it. It was like 80sdiscorockpoptechnotrancereggaeskadancehall. Heh. Anyways, it was a big risk for No Doubt to add all of this new flavor into their sound but I think it turned out great.<br />       I know all of the die-hard old school No Doubt fans are probably (...) off. To be honest, I was a little at first. I mean, their old stuff...her words are so powerful and the sound was something I don't think anyone else had. But listen...before Tragic Kingdom, No Doubt had been a band for 9 years doing ska-type music. And how many years ago did Tragic Kingdom come out? 1995...so um...6..almost 7 years or so. Gwen was fifteen when she<BR>started, she's now 32. Your music tastes change. The band has evolved and each album you can hear the change. This is another evolution of No Doubt. You can say \\"Oh, it's pop music...blah blah...\\". But I don't think the average pop album has what Rock Steady has. This is the exact same thing people said when the new Garbage album came out. Beautifulgarbage, as it is titled, is a wonderful CD. Sure, they aren't as hard or loud as in the past but it is still a great CD. I think No Doubt has gone though the same thing. If you compare the lyrics between Tragic Kingdom and Rock Steady, the lyrics have no less depth, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart without hearing the song. When people say that No Doubt has sold out, I look at it as taking a big risk. Hello? They had already sold over 10 million copies of Tragic Kingdom alone...they are already a \\"hit\\" band. They wanted to experiment with some new sounds, and I applaud them for it.<br />       I think Tragic Kingdom is still my favorite ND CD (I have all 5 of their albums), but I would have to go with Rock Steady asmy second favorite. I mean...how boring would it be if they repeated almost the same type of song over and over from album to album? You've got to change somewhere to keep people interested in you. I love this new CD and I urge everyone who is mad that they've changed their style a bit to re-listen to it. It really is a great CD. I think my favorite track right now is Hella Good. Maybe I'll change my mind, I don't know.
0783246641|3.0|Now that I am over the shock of this films ending, I guess that I will write my review.<br />This film was one of the most complicated films that I have ever seen. The whole thing was just bizarre. It was totally and utterly violent and disturbing. On the other hand, certain scenes were hilarious. Christian Bale gives a great portrayal of Patrick Bateman, a self absorbed nut who ticks off about the littlest things. He targets women when he gets really angry about things, and sometimes takes his anger on certain gentleman in his office. When things don't go his way or situations get too stressful for him, something inside him sparks, and he has to kill. Meanwhile, his relationship with his ditzy girlfriend is on the rocks, and her airhead friends constantly surround him. Life sucks for this doofus.<br />The other performances were equally effective. Reese Witherspoon plays Patrick's girlfriend, and she is perfect for the role. The musical score has hints of Bernard Herrmann's &quot;Psycho&quot; score, which fits in this film perfectly.<br />However, this film is very graphic and unnerving, and I don't know if I would recommend it or not; also, the ending was... well...never mind. <br />This one is definitely not for kids.
B00005QDW1|2.0|This is one of those albums that can drive you crazy. It contains a couple of the best songs No Doubt have ever done (&quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Waiting Room&quot;), but it's balanced off by a handful of the worst tracks they've ever laid down (leading the way in this category is the immediately grating first single, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;). Maybe I'm in the minority, but I thought Return Of Saturn was a really strong CD and a great direction for the band. I feel like this is a step backward for them.
B00004SVIK|3.0|This Is a great set, and I couldn't wait to hear it when I first picked it up.  But, there are a few problems....The main problem is that the sound quality is definitely not up to Pink Floyd standards.  The bootleg-like sound doesn't make sense.  I was reading the liner notes, and it said it was recorded at several cities along the tour, so I thought maybe the recording was bad on that particular night, but maybe this was the best performance.....but the whole set sounds like this.???...Leading me to beleive that this was put out as 'pruduct'.  Pink Floyd used to pride themselves on the sonic fidelity of their recordings.  I guess the other problem would be, as other reviewers have stated, that it needs a visual 'push' to help out.  A DVD release would have been more welcomed.  But, this set is basically required for any Floyd fan, and the accompanying book is very nice.
B000002BVN|2.0|I purchased this CD because it had the song Ghosts that I wanted to hear.  I assumed that it would be a good CD since I really do enjoy Michael Jackson's music.  However, it was very disapointing.  The only song that I really liked is &quot;Ghosts.&quot;  Is it scary is nice but the rest of the songs, which were remixes of previous songs, were not my bag.
B000002C1V|5.0|Most people also forget how good this CD actually &quot;sounds&quot;  The recording quality puts most of today's music to shame.  Like all great albums, this one gets better with repeated listenings.  And like all Pink Floyd Albums, it requires a beginning to end listening experience.  Very emotional and personal effort on the part of Roger Waters....and the last real Pink Floyd album.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|Just like Clandestino, Prxima Estacin Esperanza is an special title made by an special and unique musician. The freedom it expresses makes it necessary for all the people out there who was just born close minded to listen to it. Now! And to the rest of us, it gives us the force to go on. The best track: the whole CD, this alone explains a one and only story.
6305922756|5.0|This is exactly the DVD you want to buy, because Spinal Tap only gets better each time you watch it. It's silly, weird and smart in its humor, and it's really the standard by which all mocumentaries should be judged by. A true classic every comedy fan should own.
0515127485|4.0|This is the first Robert Harris novel I have read and I enjoyed the story. Harris gets straight to the point with the story and every step by the main character, a historian called Fluke Kelso, seems to be logical.<br />Most historical fiction somehow cop out in the end but this didn't. Don't want to reveal details but the final hundred pages are not as anti-climatic as other similar novels I have come across.<br />Also, his caricatures of journalists, historians and Stalin are pretty amusing. Yet the little known facts that he mentions about Stalin were very interesting and deeply disturbing. Harris claims that Stalin is more alarming figure in history than Hitler and the case he makes throughout the novel is pretty convincing.<br />There is a sense that he,(Harris), is having fun with the story and Soviet history and I enjoyed the ride. Beautiful book. Can't wait to get hold of his other works.
B00003CXTG|2.0|When I heard that another movie about Pearl Harbor was being made, I was excited. I was curious to see what kind of result we'd get from Jerry Bruckheimer. After waiting in line opening night for three hours, I watched in horror as a horrific American event was turned into a sappy love story. Instead of the movie focusing on the actual event, and the heroes of December 7th, we had to endure watching two idiots fight over a woman, and then the attack scene. I will admit, the attack scene was very dramatic and the special effects were wonderful. That is the only positive thing I can say about this movie. Tora! Tora! Tora! is the only movie about Pearl Harbor that I will acknowledge as a decent piece of filmmaking regarding this crucial event in American history.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Where happened to the band No Doubt?  You know, the great band that so masterfully combined elements of Ska, rock, pop and reggae??<br />This album isn't bad, it just sounds like typical dance club music.  It's as if the record label has turned them into a clone of every other pop/rock band out there.<br />There is maybe one song on there recognizeable as No Doubt.  #7. Don't let me Down.
B00004Z459|4.0|I don't know why everyone is comparing Linkin Park to that pop crap. I mean.... yea they are on MTV but I think people have to look at the big picture: the music. Honestly, I HATE METAL and I really punk but this album proved me wrong. Songs like &quot;Papercut&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot; have a good flow to them and Chester and Mike work well with each otehr vocally. This album made my expand my horizons a little bit to other music. I dont know why one of the reviewers thinks that Limp Bizkit is better than LP because LP has a sound of their own. Go ahead and consider them nu-metal or rap-rock or whatever but what they should be considered is just &quot;damn good music&quot;
B000001E7L|5.0|No Need to Argue is simply a musical masterpiece.  It is NOTHING like any other material out there.  The Cranberries themselves have had a very hard time living up to the subsequent expectations of this album.<br />The Cranberries created deeply moving melodies with  rich celtic overtures.  Delores is at her best in this album, the lyrics aren't as cheesy as in their newer albums.
B00004RF8J|4.0|I was so excited when I received this dvd.  I loved this movie as a kid, so I couldn't wait to finally own a copy of my own.  Everything was perfect, except for one thing; I really wished they would have included the alternate ending.  I wanted to see how it would have played out on screen.  That was the only disappointment with the dvd edition.  Nice transfer to dvd........I recommend it.
B000005JAX|5.0|I am a die hard DM fan and have been for 14+ years.<BR>I believe that Martin Gore is a fantastic musician all around.  Although he did not write any of the songs on this album, we all know that he is the brain behind DM as far as songwritting and music is concerned.  This album is fantastic and shows Martin Gore like we know him from DM.  He always performs the slow and dark songs and that is exactly what we get in this album.  The songs are dark, sad and just beautiful.  Martin has a way of expressing feelings in a way that not many singers and song writters can.  &quot;Compulsion&quot; has the fastest beats in this album but still will make you cry. &quot;In a manner of Speaking&quot; is a song that is a definition of perfect in every way and form.  Only Martin can put it togather and the performance is just unbelievable.  Its a perfect wedding song. The entire album is just perfect and nobody other than Martin G. can put those songs in the format that they are.  He is one of the best musicians alive today.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This was a HIGHLY anticipated dvd........and it was worth the wait.  It is such a wonderful movie.  The package is highly deserved.  The second disc is awesome.....everything you wanted to know about the process of the movie is explained.  Highly recommend!
B00003CXXS|4.0|The fact that a movie is made to be a summer blockbuster shouldn't mean that it can be dumbed down and accepted because of that. <BR>I heard this was better than 2, and after watching am trying to figure out what was good. The actors horrendous; the dialogue absolutely laughable (and you will, although it's not intended to be funny when you laugh); the story prety much non-existant; the dinos looked worse to me; and a whole series of situations that if happened in the first 2, would've cashed out the people trapped on the island, but magically here they get by.<BR>Oh well. Movie is not too good. The DVD on the other hand has some great stuff you will like. A lot of &quot;making of&quot;, behind the scenes stuff, film commentary, tons of stuff. A lot of work went into the dvd itself (video, audio, extras) and will impress you if you choose to get it. The DVD as a whole gets a 4 stars, the movie a 2. It's another example of a movie you get for the extras and skip the film itself for.
B00003CXTF|3.0|Save your money on buying this and rent it instead, unless you are in teen angst. The only thing that this had going for it was certain perspectives of photography (i.e. backend of a Japanese torpedo) - (Japanese zeros used breakaway wooden fins on their torpedos for the shallow Pearl's water and stability guidance) and some niceties of Japanese and American diplomatic/military historical commemtaries. But also this photography - with all it's tech - gives the overall picture too livid and vivid scenario for the 1940's 'feel'. The battle sequences are the only real overall worth, but only by perspective (sailors hanging on to a battleship at near rollover).The love triangle is dated, but it maybe the way of it for young servicemen then. Mild chuckles here.This critique applies to only the movie and not 'Unsung Heroes' - which has better real value.

B00005LQ04|1.0|I know all the reviews are saying that this movie is a great horror movie....but it is AWFUL, and me calling it awful is being nice.  I love horror movies and i wanted to find a good horror movie to get.  So i saw these reviews and figured that this movie must be great, but i was dreadfully wrong.  PLEASE do not get this movie, or atleast rent it first to see how bad it is.<br />I bought it and i was excited to watch it, but i literally ended up fast-fowarding through so many parts....and NOT because it was sooo scary.  I cant even get everything i want to say about this movie out because i dont have enough room to write it.  Basically, everything that anyone looks for in a movie is horrible in Suspiria....EVERYTHING.<br />I watch every movie i buy, rent, or see thinking that the movie is gonna be good.  And i wont call a movie bad unless it is really bad....i mean i even thought &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of The Ooze&quot; was good.  And if i thought that was good, just try and imagine how bad this movie really is.  BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD movie.  I want to write more about how bad this movie is, but it is like i am speechless.  I have never seen such garbage.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't mind a little difficulty, sometimes, but when it starts to pile up, it's nice to have something with a soothing edge to compare it to.  Probably the best thing in life for me is to be able to listen to &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and pretend that it is a discourse about euphoristic angels.  My ears aren't very good.  I tried looking for the words of that song in the CD liner notes and I'm not sure what I was seeing.  I think the best song title for feelings in 2001 was &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien,&quot; but this was written years ago.  I was a little slow to get this because I thought it might be too modern for me, and now that I have it, I feel slower than ever.  It's all my fault.  I never knew what anyone was doing, and now there's this.
B00005AQEA|5.0|This is the best cd i have ever heard! buy this essenetial classic, u won't regret it. Every song on here is amzing. 2pac is the man. I have over 100 cds ranging for eastcoast to westcoast and this is easily the best by far. This was the first ever double rap cd and it sold 8 million copies. After hearing this cd I went and bought every 2pac album and there all amazing.<BR>I still play this cd ever since 1996. If pac was still alive he would be owning this rap industry.
B000051VWW|5.0|Lovers Rock ranks as one of the best R&B releases of 2000-01, and possibly the best album of Sade's successful but reluctant career. Of course, the songcraft is superb and everything you've come to expect from the lady and her combo, but the real surprise is the rawness of the delivery and the simplicity of the production, which makes Lovers Rock sound like a demo record or an intimate live performance. Stylistically, it is soul with flourishes of reggae and dub, reflecting Sade's time spent in Jamaica. Lyrically, it is the most emotionally honest and vulnerable work she's ever done. What strikes me now, listening to it a whole year after its release, is how durable it is. Not many artists make timeless work nowadays. The overproduced and commercialized (stuff) that passes for R&B today will become obsolete soon enough as trends change, but Sade's work from her first album (Diamond Life) on has endured because she has focused on making timeless soul albums. In its rootsy simplicity and emotional honesty, Lovers Rock is a radical album, a reaction against all the worst excesses of commercialized R&B (manufactured beats, cynical posturing, all flash and flesh and no emotional substance). In stark contrast, neo-soul (a category that Sade has sometimes been lumped into) represents the future and potential of the genre. Lest we forget, neo-soul is not technically \\"new\\" soul but modern soul that is deeply conscious of roots and authenticity, represented by the works of artists like Erykah Badu, D'Angelo, and Jill Scott. And lest we forget, Sade pre-dated neo-soul by a whole decade. Think about it: there really was no one else doing her thing way back when she was singing Your Love Is King and Is It A Crime. The fact that she's still doing her thing successfully proves that it is not Sade who is catching up with trends, but it is the trends that are finally catching up to her. (If you like this album, you'll love Acoustic Soul, by Sade's younger soul sista India.Arie, whoopened for Sade during her Lovers Rock concert tour.)
0385721234|4.0|Como Agua Para Chocolate fue el primer libro que lei en espanol.  Me gusto la historia, especialmente los presonajes.  La autora desarrolla muy profundamente los sentimentos, suenos y deseos de los protagonistas.  No podia esperar para ver que iba a pasar en el proximo capitulo.  Fue fascinante leer sobre esa epoca y el effecto que tenia en sus vidas.  La manera en que la autora ha mezclado la preparacion de la comida con los eventos importantes en las vidas de los personajes me parecio muy especial.  Tambien el libro es bueno para los estudiantes de espanol porque es facil para leer y no necesitan traducir cada palabra para entender la idea general.  El libro hizo su magia en mi espanol tambien, porque despues de leerlo, pude hablar mucho mejor!!
B00005A1PR|2.0|Liked the song I heard on &quot;Oprah&quot; (Video), but just didn't hear what Stevie heard in the rest of it.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I got the DVD yesterday...have been waiting to do it since I saw the movie in the summer.  I saw the stage production 4 times with 4 different actors here in NYC.  I find the songs resonating in my mind frequently...I think it is genious.  Anyway, I am really impressed with the DVD...the commentary is interesting and the deleted scenes with Andrea Martin are truly hilarious.  The sound is vivid and the movie looks terrific.  A great Christmas present, if you are looking for one.
B000059XYL|5.0|The story line for this movie was different - something new - which I believe we all need in this day!<br />The dancing &amp; music was great - I have the sound track and I have the movie in DVD and watch it alot.  It's just great and Piper is wonderful.<br />I'd love to see a sequel...........
0553106635|5.0|This is really shaping up to be some saga...I just hope Mr. Martin doesn't crash and burn as the other 'venerable' authors of the day have (read: Jordan and Goodkind, who need to be end the pain of their readers, and fast). <BR>At any rate, this novel picks up where the last one left off in story (duh) and in spirit, with new twists and turns, more gore, quite a few more surprises and many hours of contentment.<BR>The story is rife with intrigue, and supposedly minor things that occurred in the first book are just now taking seed and it makes the story all the more complicated.<BR>In that way, the novel is very realistic with endless factions and scheming and every person working only for their own gain. There are no good people in this book, everyone is flawed and while that is depressing, it is also very true to life (how many paragons have you met recently--I've met two my whole life).<BR>Plus, if you're a history major, the book is chock full of historical parallels and little tweaks on various historical groups (for example, the Unsullied seem to be the perfected Roman Legionary).<BR>Highest, highest reccommendation.
B00005NOOH|5.0|The classic World at War documentary on DVD,at last available<BR>on a format that does it justice!<BR> The additional material included in the DVD set lets you see what into it`s production.<BR> Excellent transfer to DVD format AND soooo compact to store!
0789423952|5.0|An excellent book on most aspects of knot tying.  From rope types and descriptions to rope storage techniques this book provides all the essential information that the novice or intermediate knot tying individual would find practical.  The pages are filled with crisp attractive photographs of knots in their various stages.  The only weakness is that some knots are poorly represented pictorially making it increasingly difficult to tie.  In summary I found the book very useful and it is highly recommended.

0786880708|4.0|Insightful and easily adaptable is my description of the authors suggestions in this book.  Jon Kabat-Zinn describes simplistic methods on self awareness in a mellifluous writing style that is pure pleasure to read.  As a meditating novice I found the information to be practical and extremely helpful in diminishing the stessors of daily life.  However, with any self awareness or motivation book, to realize benefit the reader must challenge himself or herself to incorporate the learned material into their lives.  I suggest highlighting inspiring points so they may be easily read again and again.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|At last Disney gets it right. Of all the Disney DVDs I've bought my daughter, this was the first one to get it right (Dumbo the 60th anniversary edition is pretty good too).<br />Aside from having cleaned the movie up until it looks even better than when it was originally released in 1937 (a process explored on one of the disks), this release of Snow White includes a detailed look at how the movie came into being, from initial sketches to how it was marketed via old trailers and movie posters.<br />I always appreciate seeing the original drawings and sketches when an animated feature is the topic of discussion. It's interesting to note how the witch changed from being a frumpy Alice in Wonderland-type character to the more svelte looking queen we know today. This image was almost duplicated by the producers of The Wizard of Oz who fortunately decided to go for a more traditional looking witch prior to shooting (but that's another DVD extra).<br />The disk also explores how Snow White was technically produced. I particularly enjoyed the segment on how Disney pioneered the use of a multi-plane camera (which I now recognize whenever I watch other Disney movies for its unique quality of depth).<br />The DVD also offers some fun, interactive items. My daughter loves Dopey's Wild Ride, where she has to answer questions in order to help Dopey save Snow White.<br />Overall, this is the best release this movie could have possibly received. I rank this DVD right up there with The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and Shrek for its robust and extensive complement of extras. It's nice when the extras on a DVD become almost as worthwhile as the original movie.
B00005QDW1|5.0|First of all, I'll say that I own all 5 No Doubt albums at this point and Rock Steady has become one of my favorites today. Following in Return of Sturn's footsteps, No Doubt experiments even more with their musical abilities on this album. To help with the process, No Doubtb enlisted not one, but several producers including Nellee Hooper, William Orbit, Sly and Robbie, Steely and Clevie, Ric Ocasek and even Prince (I'm sure Tony was happy). I could make this short and simple, but I won't.  I think we'll try this on a song-by-song basis, ending with a basic conclusion. ;)<br /> 01 - &quot;Intro&quot; - nice harmonic chorus brings you in slowly and envelops you, now the album has you.<br /> 02 - &quot;Hella Good&quot; - produced by Nellee Hooper, bit of an 80s'ish Michael Jackson feel (but in a good way) mixed with a hint of disco-ness... first of many new No Doubt sounds. This song has a great progression, you can feel it building from the the start. One of the louder rock-ish songs on the album.<br /> 03 - &quot;Hey Baby&quot; - I'm sure everyone's familiar with this one by now. Without a doubt the most commercial or pop song on the album and an excellent choice for the 1st single. This song serves well as a hook for the general audience and prepares their ears for the rest of the album. It makes them open-minded if you will. Personally, I enjoy this track as much as all my other favs. Bounty Killer guests(first sly and robbie cut)<br /> 04 - \\"Making Out\\" - While &quot;Hella Good&quot; was a bit of a mix of two sounds, &quot;Making Out&quot; does radiate disco around the chorus area (but again, it works quite well). Gwen gets some great vocal sounds on this track, purring one moment and soaring the next.<br />   05 - \\"Underneath It All\\" - This is the first track that hints of No Doubt's excursion to Jamaica. Sly and Robbie's other track on the album and it shines as equally. Lady Saw guests for an excellent late-song performance right after Gwen peaks, good transition. One of my favorite songs on the album. Got a great groove to it, right up there on my jammin list with Sublime and Bob Marley. Beautiful chorus.<br />  06 - \\"Detective\\" - Opens with a playful somewhat muted chorus of Gwen's introducing this song. Extremely well-written song with notes that fall exactly where you want them to.<br />  07 - \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" - Ric Ocasek's first production on the album with a certain 80's feel to it that works as a pretty good song until the chorus hits, and then progresses to be a even better. Of the 13 tracks on Rock Steady, I view all of them as ultra-great, with \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and \\"Waiting Room\\" being just a step below.<br />08 - \\"Start the Fire\\" - Steely and Clevie overseeing, beautiful part of the album, I love this song.  I loved the chorus the first time I heard it (or the first 50 times as those who tried to hunt the MP3 might know). Gwen's vocals are again excellent, but when aren't they really? I wish I could hear No Doubt perform \\"Sometimes\\" now after they've grown so much. It was great the first time around.<br />09 - \\"Running\\" - As of yet, I don't think I truly appreciate how beautiful this song is. It is the slow ballad song of the album, thus as I am a product of the early 90s grunge-alternative scene, I am inclined to skip it occasionally. Another Nellee Hooper gem. As with all of the tracks on Rock Steady, the production is extremely smooth with no element seeming unpolished. No Doubt thankfully is a band that easily reproduces their incredible talents live as well.<br />10 - \\"In My Head\\" - Another Nellee Hooper cut, I would say the masterpiece of  the bunch, but that's just because it's one of my favorites. Gwen's sultry intro bounces along and easily meshes into the chorus. Yet another of my favorites.<br />11 - \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\" - My absolute favorite off Rock Steady, another Ric Ocasek track. Cool guitar intro and a medium-fast rock progression that blends into one of No Doubt's best loud angry rock verses yet.  I'm inclined to like those. ;)<br />12 - \\"Waiting Room\\" - Honestly, this is my least favorite song on Rock Steady at the moment, but I admit that it's more than possible that I don't properly appreciate it yet. \\"Waiting Room\\" is Prince's contribution with credits for production, backing vocals, and partial writing of the song. I'm not a big Prince fan, so incidentally, I would imagine that might account for it not taking a higher slot on my list. I'll give credit where due though : Gwen and Prince chiming back and forth, combined with a good hook-y chorus that I do especially like.<br />13 - \\"Rock Steady\\" - Nellee Hooper's last addition, another of my happy jamming songs from this CD. Gwen intros with sweet, innocent sounding vocals reminiscent of \\"I'll Throw My Toys Around\\" from the Rugrats soundtrack. The harmonies in the chorus of this song are among the best on the album, certainly worth an equal inspection (They are all wonderful, after all).<br />  Fast approaching the 1000 word limit. ;)<BR>In summation, No Doubt rank among my all-time favorite artists (I currently own about 2200 mp3's ranging from 1940-present in practically every genre, steadily increasing). I love all of No Doubt's albums, Tragic Kingdom was a wonderful ska/rock bridge and at the time was my favorite of the 3 then. Return of Saturn's release provided a new favorite with a rock/pop mesh that seemed to focus on experimentation with new sounds for the band. Rock Steady follows the same idea in perhaps a different direction, and like the others, is equally a masterpiece. (972 words including these).
B00003CXTF|2.0|The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor as shown here was incredible.  But I wonder why (yes, our intelligence did make mistakes in not picking up on the attack until too late) that most of the U.S. service men are made out to be complete incompetents?  There are bombs exploding everywhere, and most of the sailors run around screaming!  Were we that badly trained, or did we need Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck there to help save the day?  The love story is completely boring and predictable.  Factual inaccuracies abound.  For an expensive movie, they sure cut on fact-checkers and script writers!  Rent the movie, fast-forward to the attack scenes, and don't waste your time on the rest of this drivel!
080017948X|2.0|Brought this version thinking that it was soon to be released special edition.  It was on the coming soon list.  Turned out to be a reissue with RCE.  Doh!!!<br />Excellent film, lousy DVD.
B00005214X|5.0|I listened to All Things Must Pass over and over and over again when it first came out.  Nothing ever sounded so good coming through a 13-year-old's headphones.  The re-release does not disapoint at all.  Fantastic.  Is there a better two-song combo than &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot; in existence?  To think this most humble and decent of men swallowed his pride and essentially played session man for the decade prior to this work. [OK, to the two greatest songwriters in history, I'll grant you that.  But still - no room on Abbey Road or Let it Be for any of these masterpieces?  Come on.]<br />There are some earlier quibbles on these pages about &quot;My Sweet Lord (2000).&quot;  I'll add this thought - this man had had part of his throat removed and was in the throes of lung cancer.  Now, think about the effort it must have taken to sing that part.  Let's think of it as a wonderful parting gift.<br />I see the &quot;Dark Horse,&quot; &quot;Living in the Material World,&quot; &quot;Extra Texture&quot; triumverate has been re-released as well, but how can we convince the powers now overseeing George's musical legacy to give us &quot;33 &amp; 1/3&quot; and the vastly underrated &quot;George Harrison&quot; re-releases as well?  That eponymous album - released in approx. 1979/80 I believe - had some great stuff on it.
B00005QW5X|5.0|My favorite movie of 2001.  Excellent story with great songs.
B0000524E5|5.0|I thought that Coyote Ugly was an awesome movie. Piper Perabo has great talent and should be given or sought out for more roles. This movie is a definite must see, as well as, a must have. The music for the movie was right on, although I would have loved to hear Piper's voice on more of the songs. She is definite STAR material... :-)
B00003CX9S|5.0|Or is it?  I first saw this when I was maybe twelve or thirteen - I was alone in a hotel room somewhere in New Jersey, my parents were out by the pool.  I watched this movie from beginning to end - I was frightened, terrorized and very, very sad - I couldn't really describe what I went through.  I didn't want to watch this thing for years afterward.  Eventually I revisited the movie &amp; it has become one of my favorites.  It is the only film that makes me cry, even to this day.  It is solid proof of the possibility that cinema could be the most powerful artform ever created - the closest to directly describing the carefully blended chaos of the dream.  Mel Brooks - if he made any right decisions in his career - it was hiring on David Lynch to direct this film.  Just as perfect as Tim Burton directing SLEEPY HOLLOW.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I really can not believe this movie was made, let alone released. I mean this was the worst waste of 3 hours in my life. I have seen some bad movies, but come on. First off the scipt is so weak. It felt like I was watching a junior high school play, written by a 13 year old. The war scenes lacked any kind of excitement, all the typical cliches were here. WHAT A WASTE MONEY.!!!!!!! for all you dvd geeks, the dvd is acutally top quality, great picture, and sound is tight.
0743216458|5.0|I read the book, while I was watching the miniseries. It was cool that what I was reading ended up on screen.<br />It was a great book. And seeing it on screen made it better because you get the visuals.
0792151712|5.0|When you think of real blockbusters, a few come to mind such as 'Ben Hur' or 'Gone With The Wind'.  'Titanic' brought the blockbuster into the 90's.  After the rush of sci-fi and horror flicks, it was nice to see a really traditional movie.  And that's all that there is to 'Titanic' really - stunning special effects, an involving love story, a sorrowful (and now infamous) ending mixed with fact.  It's this combination that makes the movie so irresistable, something that if you saw at the cinemas, you couldn't fail to be impressed by.  It completely blows you away, and if you feel a bit manipulated it's probably because you were.  Cameron mixed the elements for an old-fashioned blockbuster weepie that would gradually become a complete phenomenon.<br />There are obviously those that will slate this movie for its sheer commericialism, but 'Titanic' revels in it.  This is a movie aimed at pleasing everyone and it shows.  However, such critics may pay attention to the fact that many of the actors come from low-budget or intelligent movies - Kate Winslet (Heavenly Creatures), Leonardo diCaprio (What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) and Kathy Bates (Misery).  Although none of them are quite as good as the roles they played in the aforementioned films, they still make good value for money.<br />The only downside to 'Titanic' was its inevitable backlash, which has duly been paid by many reviewers on this page.
B00005RIKD|1.0|OK, I should have checked this site before buying the CD locally.  No where on the cover do they mention &quot;live&quot;.  I like the collection of songs and would have much preferred the studio tracks.  This isnt Sting at his best, and the background noise is distracting.  Let this one go.
0385505833|1.0|OK. This HAS to be the WORST book ever. Luther and his wife Nora (wealthy Arian Christians) have decided to skip Christmas. Their neighbors torment them, shun them, vandalize their lawns and gossip all over town just because 2 people decide to take a cruise rather than decorate the house with a stupid Frosty the Snowman. It's not funny, and not believable. The leader of the neighbors represents Hitler, his kid, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, (practically burning a cross on the lawn of this couple).<br />And Luther and Nora are no better. When they find out their precious daughter Blair is coming home for Christmas with her new Peruvian boyfriend all they can think about is &quot;How dark is his skin!&quot; and when they finally meet him, &quot;He wasn't dark at all! At least two shades lighter than Luther himself!&quot; As if this is a cause of celebration, or even a basis of judging someone. And to make it even more disgusting, Luther and Nora spend the entire book going to a tanning salon to DARKEN THEIR SKIN FOR THEIR CRUISE!!! John Grisham, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!??  You owe me money, Mr. Grisham. I am offended.<br />Please ship this book. It hurts.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Thsi movie is around 3 hours long and 2 and a half hours revolves around a sappy pitiful love story. These directors should be asahmed of themselves. This was suppose to explore the most patriotic day of all time. How can this movie envolve such a hidous plot. The action scenes are vivid and great but the rest is absoltely horrible. I think this movie puts our country to shame.
6305297207|5.0|Sam Remi'es Evil Dead is a landmark film not just for its violent contant. (and when I mean violent content I mean it)But for its low buget quality, humor and apsoultly brillent photography. This film as set the standerd for all cult films. The DVD is good even theo I got the one that dosent have any goodies. The only goodies that are good is a brand new tranfer thats really all I care about.

0060245867|5.0|She'll want you to read it again.  If you read it again, she'll want to talk about it.  After you talk about it, she'll want to know what happens if you give a mouse something else.  After that, she'll use her imagination to explore cause/effect relationships.  Once she understands those relationships, she'll realize that everything we do has consequences, even the good things.  Then she'll probably ask you to read the book again...<br />So much good stuff in such a small book.  It should be in every parent's library.
0380973650|5.0|Neil Gaiman is indeed the master.  This novel is without a doubt in my Top Three Novels of 2001!<br />This is an IMPRESSIVE novel that is SCREAMING to be optioned by Hollywood and made into the next spooky/macabre classic.  But if they do, Neil has to do the screenplay!!<br />Without repeating too much of what has already been said... the character of Shadow is instantly likeable.  He is the novel's focal point.  His journey and adventure through the real world and that of the Gods is highly entertaining.<br />This novel is like a tapestry with many, many, many interwoven pieces.  It is a sheer delight to read.  There is something for the life-long Gaiman fan...(namely some uncredited cameos by the Endless)... and there is quite a lot for the first time reader... namely a well crafted novel.<br />There are tales and origins of Gods of the old/ancient world, as well as appearances by America's new Gods.  TV, technology, etc.<br />Neil even crafts a story within a story for Shadow when he is hiding out in a small Wisconsin town.  For television buffs, a sort of &quot;Picket Fences&quot;/&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; murder mystery.  (I called it right away, fyi.)<br />I simply cannot say enough nice things about this absolute gem from Mr. Gaiman.  His depiction of the midwestern states is dead on.  ALL of the characters are thought out and vividly represented.<br />Read this one if you get the chance.  You will not be disappointed.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Great new works.  Enya's 2 works alone make this CD a must for any music lover.  The music goes well with the written story.  I can only imagine it will be excellent when matched with the film.
B000002P74|5.0|What can I say? Every single song on this album is a classic. If I wanted to list the great songs on it, I'd just direct you to the track listing. Yes -- it's that good.<br />Obviously, the most popular song on this album is &quot;Sweet Home Alabama.&quot; It's a good song, but there's more to Skynyrd than ole &quot;Sweet Home.&quot; Songs like &quot;Workin' For MCA,&quot; &quot;The Needle And The Spoon,&quot; &quot;Call Me The Breeze,&quot; and &quot;The Ballad Of Curtis Loew&quot; are every bit as good as &quot;Sweet Home.&quot;<br />&quot;Pronounced&quot; is a great album. &quot;Street Survivors&quot; and &quot;Gimme Back My Bullets&quot; (which is SO underrated!) are great, too, and &quot;Nuthin' Fancy&quot; is a gem, but the greatest studio album ever put out by Skynyrd has to be &quot;Second Helping.&quot; Buy them all (and also &quot;One More From The Road [Deluxe Edition]&quot; and, if you want to hear what the new version of the band sounds like, &quot;Edge Of Forever&quot;), but put this album at the top of the list. <br />Also, don't listen to whoever said the mix/production are poor. This album's mix is fine. Skynyrd albums use panning EXTREMELY well, increasing the impact of their double or triple guitar leads and riffs. The production is fine, too, and &quot;Call Me The Breeze&quot; is far from lame. <br />One more thing: &quot;Was I Right Or Wrong&quot; is a great song. It was originally supposed to be on this album, and, well, it would have been right at home on the original album. It finally gets its much deserved place on the album with this reissue!<br />All in all, this album is pretty hard to beat, and you will enjoy it... that can be guaranteed.
0767802810|5.0|I have added it to my list of movies to make me smile when when the world is most challenging - The American President, While You Were Sleeping, Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, Splash, Father of the Bride and many other heart warmers.  This movie takes you back.  It historically captures the times of the Baby Boomer's Mom and Dad's highschool graduation.  It also allows you to happily close your eyes and imagine the possibility of seeing, speaking with and hugging those you've lost over the decades.  The story is very tender, endearing and sensitive.  I was surprised when I saw that it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola (who also owns my favorite Napa vineyard, Neibaum-Coppola, where my favorite Merlot is produced).  There is no darkness, violence or eeriness.  Only light joy, touching moments and the meaning of family.  What would you do differently, if you had another chance?
B00005LOUQ|5.0|The Grinch is a wonderful film for children of all ages. Not only is it a funny holiday film it will also fill the hearts of grinches, Scrooges and Jeremey Creeks everywhere. Jim Carrey's crazy antics keep this film alive in our hearts. Maybe it doesn't follow the story but hey people would hate a film about a monster stealing Christmas for seventy five minutes then it would be a stinker. Parents if your kids love Christmas films and Jim Carrey then buy it and put it under the tree this Christmas.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I must admit this is my first No Doubt cd.  I've always been a fan of all of their top hits.  This cd is really solid. A few songs like, &quot;hey baby&quot; have that island beat.  Some songs out there take awhile to catch on, but with the songs on this cd, you will be singing along on your 2nd listen.  They said it is their most solid album and I happen to agree having only heard it a few times.  Longtime no doubt fans will be pleased with this cd. New fans will find a sound and some songs that they wish they had found much sooner!  floriyorker@yahoo.com
0060012331|5.0|Maurice (a talking cat), Keith the stupid-looking kid, and a clan of intelligent talking rats have a good thing going. Keith can play the penny-whistle and the rats can manage a rat infestation better than anyone. The Pied Piper had nothing on their scam. At least until the rats' increasing intelligence starts to come with the price of a conscience. They finally agree on one last job--but the existing rat catchers in Bad Blintz (author Terry Pratchett always picks good town names) have their own plots going and their schemes look like bad news for Maurice and the clan.<br />Pratchett has created a tongue-in-cheek fairy tale set in his Discworld. The rats and Maurice struggle with the dawning of conscience--Maurice always gives his victims a chance to talk before he eats them, with their place in the world, and with the powerful rat-king who wants to use their power for war against the humans.<br />Human characters, especially Keith and Malicia, play supporting roles but the real stars in this novel. Malicia's (often successful) attempts to create a story out of life frustrate Keith while providing worthwhile lessons (if you aren't making the story, you're a bit character in someone else's story) for both other characters and the readers. Overall, though, the rats--all given amusing names they selected from reading labels (Dangerous Beans is a favorite) are the most interesting characters and characters with the most compelling character arcs.<br />I sat down to read THE AMAZING MAURICE AND HIS EDUCATED RODENTS, and didn't get up until I'd finished it--with a lot of laughs in the process. This novel probably won't change your life, but it just might.
0385505833|4.0|What an enjoyable read. John Grisham has put into words the feelings that we all have at some time during Christmas, the things we dare not say out loud. I expected this book to resemble the Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens and there were a few references to humbugs. However I was pleasantly surprised by the way the story unfolded and the very heart warming end. This book could be turned into one of those tear jerking, feel good Christmas movies. I hope it is.

B00001U0E1|1.0|This movie won Best Picture over Saving Private Ryan? Who was doing the judging and how much were they paid? I tried watching this movie but literally had to turn it off after 30 minutes. Truly unwatchable in my opinion. What tripe.
0451527712|4.0|Frankenstein is one of those books that makes the reader wonder how the author could have ever made this up. As a sophmore in highschool I was required to read it in for my English 2 class.  I glanced through it at first and thought it to be quite verbose and overly detailed.  My assumptions were wrong. When I actually got into the book I began to really enjoy it.  I realized that the many details help you visualize what is going on more. Mary Shelly creates a very imaginitive and creative plot about a man who tampers with the laws of nature.  She combines science and fantasy to create one of the greatest novels of all time.  So if you have the patience to read this somtimes slow but fabulous book, I definately recommend you do so.
B00003CXRP|2.0|Bravo to the makers of &quot;Castaway&quot; - you have really created a truly amusing film.  Amusing, but only when viewed as a comedy, and not the deep and touching drama this was meant to be.  The film starts off on archetypal note: a man (Tom Hanks) is so pathetically obsessed with his job at a mail company it is obvious things will change and he will become a good man in the end.  Yet things take an unexpected turn on this &quot;deep&quot; journey when Tom Hanks' plane crashes and he drags himself to a nearby island.  He is - predictably - the only survivor.  Things stop being serious when Tom Hanks attempts to continue controlling all job-related things.  It seems he spends the first half of the movie screaming as he speeds down a hill towards whatever mail has washed up.  The best part of this movie is the friend he creates out of a ball that came from one of many packages that wash up.  He gives it a little face and speaks to it, calling it &quot;Wilson&quot;.  Their relationship has both good and bad times.  Like any normal couple, they fight with each other.  They laugh together and cry together.  The only problem is that they are not a couple; it's only a ball.  Their relationship reaches its low point during a really savage fight.  In the end Tom Hanks tosses his better half and it bounces out of the cave he calls home.  In a wave of regret he rushes outside and frantically searches for Wilson in the dark night.  The movie wraps up after Tom's return to civilization; he is driving his car (with a wilson ball inside) around in the middle of nowhere.  He stands in the road signaling that he is making life-changing decisions and the movie closes on that completely undecided note.  If you are in need of a good laugh, this is the movie for you!
B00005QDW1|1.0|As a huge Gwen Stephani fan, I am shocked that she would release this with her name on it.  Every song has one verse or phrase that is good, but unfortunately, all that happens is that phrase is repeated over and over again.  There is no originality within any song.  It's as if you're listening to a broken record.  The single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; isn't bad, but the rest of the album is not anywhere near the talent the world knows Gwen has.
6304595247|2.0|As much as I like Juliette Binoche as an actress, I sincerely thought the role of Catherine Earnshaw did not suit her at all. It was not convincing - Catherine Earnshaw is a complicated profound and yet mislead person - she is here played as a smiling happy-go-lucky person, laughing incessantly, even when discussing such a serious matter as matrimony with Ellen Dean. She took it with a pinch of salt. I think Emily Bronte did not wish her to be quite so light hearted.<BR>However Ralph Fiennes plays Heathcliff beautifully - the role suited him very well, and so for Ellen Dean.
B0000508U6|2.0|The most overrated album of the year.  It is in no way deserving of all the high marks.  I remember listening to it at the record store and thinking that it didn't really grab me.  But I thought, &quot;Everybody says it's really good, maybe it'll grow on me.&quot;  I should have trusted my instinct.  Except for &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot;, it's just dull, mediocre at best.  I can't believe people compare them to Radiohead.
B00005QDW1|4.0|When No doubt released their self-titled album we were too busy wallowing in soundtracks of  self pity and uselessness provided by the short lived grunge movement.  Any band that was optimistic or bouncy was looked at with stern eyes of fire and written off as cartoony or not real.  Sometimes we just need to laugh at ourselves instead of smelling teen spirit or worrying about Jeremy.  So when the grunge cloud floated away into eternal loathing , the sun started shining again and enthusiastic music began to see the light of day.  Such is the case with No Doubt.  From the beginning they were a band that loved to connect with their audience and to share their energy like a buffet, using ska as their muse.  The new direction they take in Rocksteady is not the same in Tragic Kingdom or Return of Saturn.   They took the sugar train and from repeated listens of RS you will get brain cavities.  However even with all the sweets floating in the air they still manage to keep their integrity, credibility and vision intact. The highlights are \\"Hella Good\\", \\"Making out\\", \\"Hey baby\\", \\"detective \\"and \\"underneath it all\\". It's basically a party album with the songs being produced by different artists to give it an honest variety.  Rick Ocasek (from Weezer fame) and Prince, among others,  both contribute their talents and the result is a good balanced album.  Usually if theyre are too many cooks in the kitchen you get a hodge podge of material and it sounds really lopsided.  My proof....see most movie soundtracks.  With \\"Rock steady\\" Gwen Stefanti has thrown a party and we are all invited, it's an invitation I happily accept.
B00004TWZF|2.0|The original 119 minute version of The Big Blue featuring the superb soundtrack by Bill Conti is my favorite film of all time.  After purchasing Bessons Director's cut DVD (the only DVD version available) I found that it greatly slows the pace of the movie while adding very little story.  The new accompanying musical score by Eric Sierra is bland and combined with the different ending, the feel of the original film is destroyed.  I regret buying this DVD.
0887307280|1.0|...to get a feel for the revised edition.  The first one was great but very little was added to this one to make it a good buy.  But why take stock in my opinion - I'm an idiot anyway.<br />BE
B00004YB9Y|1.0|Maybe I'm too critical, but this is horrible and worse than a high school concert. I think the person who wrote that it sounded like a Saturday Night Live skit is right on. Hey, maybe we should call them up and have them do it!<br />Anyway, there are times the singers rush the orchestra, they time cutoffs poorly, they aren't synchronized, they mess up the tempo, etc. Not the orchestra - the singers. It sounds like an impromptu concert where they are holding the sheet music in front of their eyes for the first time and are recording it in one take. And it's true, to hear an American folk song sung in an operetic voice just sounds wrong - and it is wrong. I bought this for myself and now I'm using it for a White Elephant gift at work.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever created. If you are into heavy music and also like rock you will love it. It is hard to put SOAD into any category perhaps because they are a fresh stream themselves...  <br />I would recommend it to all who appreciate novelty and alternative thought in music. The actual lyrics are not so important. This kind of music would be hard to digest for the shallow mind/taste though.
0790729350|4.0|Ever hear of the publication of listeners' versions of music heard on the radio? ...And how different, in often hilarious ways, they are from the published lyrics of the songs? I played this DVD, and the subtitles appeared, and I decided not to turn them off, even though my Mother Tongue is English. I enjoyed this film in a way I've never had the opportunity to do in the thirty years since the Theatrical release. I wanted to attend Woodstock in real-time, but my Army bosses wouldn't let me leave the hot, humid climate, the bizarre speech, and alien customs of the local people to go to Woodstock; so I stayed at Fort Benning GA that August. But I've known the lyrics of many of the songs on this DVD, and the author of the subtitles apparently never sought out the published versions. Mind you, the performances, being live, were in a sense unique, with innovation and variation on the part of the performers rampant. <br />But the post-Apocalyptic &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; from CS&amp;N tells the story of the meeting of two from diferent sides in the Final War, and at one point, one says, &quot;I can see by your coat, my friend, you're from the other side. There's just one thing I got to know: can you tell me, please, who won?&quot; -referring to the Final War. The subtitles displayed at this point in the performance read, &quot;I can see why you brought a friend from the Other Side....can you tell me, please, who am I?&quot; -referring to an existential question involving a spiritualist? In the Woodstock Era? Possibly, of course! But is that what Dave Crosby (looking young &amp; healthy with his orginal liver!) and Graham Nash meant, or even wrote? In the liner notes on the LP cover, the lyrics were included, as related above.<br />There were a number of these egregious errors, but, as I indicated above, it adds fun to the watching of this great film and being transported back to a time that made Camelot seem lackluster and dreary.
B00003CXXS|5.0|This is an awesome movie !! I loved it! I failed to see it in it's theatrical release and just finished viewing the DVD. It is superior to the first two installments in some aspects. First of all, the dinos look a bit prehistoric in the the first movie compared to the technology and animatronic dinos in this movie. The two technologies work seamlessly together to create a much more real effect. I loved the fight scene between the two huge carnivorous dinos! What an amazing feat that was! Where the movie lacks in plot, it makes up for again and again with the spectacular live action dinosaurs and SGI. This DVD is a MUST HAVE to complete (for now) your Jurassic Park collection. It is a non stop thrill ride that never lets up! It gets going MUCH faster than JPII, and keeps delivering until (almost) the final scene. This is where the movie FAILS. It was quite a dissapointment to see the movie end the way it did. I was really expecting a final, edge of your seat confrontation between man and dino like the first two movies delivered. But this one ends on a sour note. The overall movie, with all it's great effects deserves 5 stars, while the ending would be lucky to deserve 1 star. Still, buy it, you will love it. This movie ROCKS!
0783225970|4.0|Scarface is definately a friend to me. I really enjoyed this movie. Al Pacino, one of the best actors of his time, was very convincing as Tony Montana. From the shower(chainsaw) scene, to the hottub, to being blown to bits at the very end. Every scene was well done. I pull this one out every once in a while just to watch it. I enjoy it everytime.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Thank god I didn't bother going to see this at the cinema - got the DVD last weekend and even in the comfort of my own home with a nice glass of wine I couldn't be bothered to watch the whole film.  Boring love story, bad casting (Kate Beckinsale was awful)   - I want my money back !
0140135154|5.0|WAYS OF SEEING is a collection of seven essays.  Three are pictorial; four are textual.  All are about art, how art is seen, how it is valued, how it is used, and what we can learn from looking at art.<br />Of the textual essays, the first is about the mystification of art and history by its associations with assumptions and values that are not necessarily inherent in the work itself, but in its rarity, uniqueness, and commercial demand.  He discusses art as being seen as an almost religious icon, and how the reproduction of images has contributed to the mystification of the original image.<br />The second textual essay is a study of women and how they are seen, who sees them, and how they see themselves being seen by others.  It is Berger's critique of the Nude as an art form, and he argues that they place women as objects to be seen and desired and overpowered by men, the subject.<br />The third essay is about the tradition of oil paintings in Europe between 1500 and 1900.  Berger explains the connections between the content of these paintings and the ownership of them as a symbol of affluence, as products of capitalism and the maintenance of the status quo.<br />The fourth essay has to do with publicity, or advertisement, and the reference that such images make to oil paintings, sexual attractiveness, and dissatisfaction with the current state of life (the promise of a better future, given that you buy something).<br />I'm not an art historian, and I don't know much about theories of art.  But WAYS OF SEEING is a book that pierces into the comfortable notions of art as belonging to the elite and cultured, and reveals its role as used to maintain power structures.  Who commissioned the work, who is meant to look at it, what is it putting on display, what are its political motives?  These are questions that should be asked of any work of art, and Berger aims to ask these questions.  By doing so, he also enlightens the reader.
B00005JKES|1.0|The previous reviews nearly say it all.  What a great show, and I'm glad it has finally made it to DVD.  HOWEVER, just like the VHS box set, the Pilot is mysteriously missing, and you can't even order it separately on DVD yet.  So, I ask, what good is it to own Episodes 1-7 when you can't own the 2-hour Pilot which sets up the entire series?!?  If you start with episode 1, you'll be lost. This is one stupid oversight by the distributors.  <br />The series gets 5 stars and then some.  For not containing the beginning of the story, the DVD only gets 1 star.
B00000JGHM|4.0|I purchased this DVD sight unseen on the advice of a friend at work. Great suggestion Ken. I was thoroughly entertained throughout this film. The gunfight outside the bank was great. The surround sound on this DVD was done very well. You hear everything. The scene at the cafe'..... all you can say is WOW! DeNiro and Pacino were perfect in that scene together. This is one I would definately recommend. It's a keeper.
B00005T5VE|5.0|The MADONNA GHV2 Limited Edition CD is not much differant than original GHV2. There are no extra songs and the only thing really differant is the special packaging along with the 2 or 3 more pages in the booklet. I do love this MADONNA GHV2 CD very much but do advise you to only get this Limited Edition CD if your a true die hard fan. It is a great collecters item but other than tha I would stick with the original as it is much cheaper and missing very little besides the fancy packaging. I give this CD 5 stars because of the great songs and because it's MADONNA and she can do little wrong.Track Listings1. Deeper And Deeper2. Erotica3. Human Nature4. Secret5.

B000058983|5.0|This record in my opinion is much better than &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; (which none of the Beatles pointed to as one of their favorites) or &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (you'll have to forgive me on this one, I hate the Beach Boys). It is adventurous and the lyrics are anything but 'vapid'. I checked out that reviewers 'recommended' picks and believe me, he has zero taste in music.
B00004XMSN|5.0|Loretta Young and David Niven would have been easy picks for the Bishop and his wife Julia.  But Cary Grant as Dudley the angel?  That was truly inspired.  There were any number of actors at that time who could have played saintly and pure-minded angels.  Only Cary could have portrayed an incredibly handsome, well tailored and sophisticated, but still believable, angel.  One of the most touching scenes is the one where he asks Julia not to send him away, back to where he's neither hot nor cold.  He makes immortality seem so very lonely.
6300183211|5.0|THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.A MUST SEE MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT ALREADY, AND IF YOU'VE SEEN IT YOU'LL KEEP ON WATCHING IT!
0385495323|5.0|I'm a software programmer and I enjoy reading scientific journals from time to time. This book combines both: deep scientific understanding of the problem and very nice style of describing complicated things in plain language.<BR>I'm sure you will enjoy it.
B00005ASQ1|1.0|I might have liked this movie better if I could understand the mumbling delivery of Rob Brown's performance. What did he say? The relationship between Wallace and Forrester was contrived. There were moments of brilliance, but mostly this movie was slow and dull. The closing credits music by IZ was very nice.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Christina has the voice of an angel of course!
0061092037|5.0|Once again Jeffrey Archer brings us a Kane &amp; Abel type of story, which he writes so well. He builds two very different characters and entangles their lives to present a superb story that can be easily read in one sitting... you just can't put the book down! The only bad part? when you finish the last chapter you'll be left wanting more!
0062502182|5.0|I keep this book around and really enjoy reading it from time to time. It's simple, wise and relaxing. There is nothing special you have to do to understand it - but it's a real buity and you should give it a try.
B00005PJ8I|1.0|Could have been a good film, but something went terribly wrong. I think the screenwriter had alot of internal dialogue that he forgot to share with the audience. Long, long, very long stretches of silence and &quot;meaningful glances&quot; that are disconnected from the action. The relationships are fuzzy and never come to a conclusion, it's all left hanging ... the woman artist on the ranch, the former lover now married to someone else, the widowed best friend, even his relationship with his job. It's a movie about a personal journey that leads the viewer nowhere. The trailer shows the best of this film.
B00004U2HK|5.0|This movie has got to be my all time favorite. I enjoy all the musicals but always come back to the Sound of Music. It is so relaxing to sit and watch the beautiful scenery at the beginning of it and then to be able to enjoy the music all the way through it. What an inspiring story and Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer were terrific. Just loved it and watch it at least once a week.
B00005QW5X|5.0|&quot;Hedwig&quot; is easily one of the best movies of 2001...if not of the past several years. And this DVD treatment does this flick tremendous justice. Included are bonus features such as commentary by writer/director/star John Cameron Mitchell, deleted scenes, and cast and crew filmographies. But the best treat is a feature-length (80+ minutes) history of Hedwig...the character, the off-Broadway show and the movie. This documentary -- which is worth the purchase price itself -- even includes footage from John Cameron Mitchell's first appearance as Hedwig back in 1994. In short, this is a must-have for any Hed-Head!
B00005RYQO|3.0|If I really liked fast japanese cars, this movie would be a whole lost better.  As it is, the movie did an okay job, but nothing to brag about.  Go rent &quot;Point Break&quot; for more or less the same effect and with a little more soul.
B00003CXTF|4.0|What made this movie even better was the superb casting.  Of course everyone knows the setting and plot, but the &quot;story within the story&quot; is very engrossing.  It's hard to mix romance and action without one or the other suffering, but here the director did a superb job.<br />The attack sequence at Pearl Harbor was done extremely well and with great attention to detail.  You will see camera stunts that are incredible!  One of the best parts of the movie is the portrayal of FDR by Jon Voight, and Jimmy Doolittle by Alec Baldwin. <br />The only problem with the movie is that I would have liked to see the dynamic between the main protagonists played out a little more, especially at the end.  Otherwise, quite entertaining and well worth the time and money.
B00005R2M3|4.0|&quot;Laundry Service&quot; is a mix of catchy pop oriented songs (&quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;/&quot;Suerte&quot;, &quot;Ready for the good times&quot; which is ready for the dance floor) and rockier edges (&quot;Rules&quot;, &quot;Te dejo Madrid&quot;, &quot;Poem to a horse&quot;, the rock ballads like &quot;The one&quot;, &quot;Underneath your clothes&quot;, &quot;Fool&quot;, &quot;Que me quedes tu&quot;). I enjoyed the cultural mix in her sound, integrating latino beats, pop, oriental vibes. I understand, having heard the excellent &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; as well, that her Spanish speaking fans might be a little deceived, but this is honestly a good pop-rock album high above today's common pop standards.<br />The voice is somewhere between Alanis Morissette, Sarah McLachlan or Gwen Stefani sometimes, but she has enough personality to develop a completely personal style. She has what it takes to become a great artist. I read one of the previous reviewers said her accent was too strong to sing ballads in English - where did that person hear any trace of accent? The infused sound and the versatility of her voice makes it a record you do not really grow tired of, as you're travelling through diverse moods, rhythms and styles from track to track.<br />I am confident that her strong personality (which shines through the sometimes very naïve lyrics and her always inhabited interpretations) will guide her to make the right choices in the future. I will keep an eye on her next releases... <br />I was hesitant about purchasing this album because Shakira is (yet?) unknown in my corner of the world but I don't regret the encounter. Oh, and by the way, I am now out to complete my collection with her previous Spanish albums.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Okay, I don't actually have this CD because, being a huge Madonna fan, I already have all the songs on her other CDs.  This is stuff from her Erotica CD up to Music, and while some of them aren't exactly &quot;hits&quot; (did anyone hear &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot; on the radio?), they represent the best of The Madonner from the last decade or so.  But look, if you want &quot;Rain,&quot; &quot;This Used To Be My Playground,&quot; or all the other songs people have mentioned were missing on this CD, then buy Something To Remember! Sheesh! The reason Madonna didn't include these songs is because they already exist in another greatest hits compilation (although she did include &quot;Take a Bow&quot; for some reason).  The best stuff is from Ray of Light, my personal fave Madonna CD and probably her most meaningful and experimental album.  SO--if you want her fast, danceable (Take a Bow excepted), fun stuff, then buy this CD! If you want her slow ballads then buy Something To Remember--it's that simple. So stop whining already! Heck, buy all three greatest hits compilations, they're great!  Unfortunately, the awesome Thunderpuss Megamix isn't on here, otherwise I'd buy the CD. But if you heard a song by Madonna you liked, but couldn't bear to buy a whole CD (and shame on you for that!), then this is the perfect opportunity to get all her good stuff!
0385505833|5.0|Who hasn't wanted to skip Christmas?  I know I have.  This is a must read for the holiday season.  This book hits the nail on the head...Most of our holiday traditions are meant to make other people happy, not ourselves.  I truly enjoyed this book.
B00004WC6J|5.0|I don't know if David Sylvian has any casual fans in America. If there are any out there who bought &quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot;  or heard &quot;God's Monkey&quot; on the radio and liked it...but who don't own anything by Sylvian, buy this.<br />Fans will already know about this &amp; own it for the rare and previously unreleased tracks. All of my fellow reviewers make excellent points about the contents of this collection. It is amazing.<br />He is both a poet and one of the most interersting musical artists out there. The music is full of surprises, and the words--honestly, Sylvian's lyrics (especially on &quot;Secrets&quot;) woke me to the meaning of the phrase &quot;transported by the music.&quot;
0671027344|4.0|It was hard to put Wallflower down in my post-breakup state. However what I got out of it was terribly depressing as opposed to the apparently positive and promising lesson I thought that it wanted to convey.<BR>Wallflower follows high school freshman Charlie, (who reminds me of Holden in Catcher in the Rye, minus the level of wit and appeal) through school and his experiences with different levels of happiness and abuse.<BR>I liked it. I'd read it again, but next time when I'm feeling better! :)
157453470X|2.0|A great book, but beware - the &quot;unabridged&quot; audio book edition is actually &quot;unabridged excerpts&quot; from the book Cryptonomicon.  I bought this as a gift for my father who has been dying to read the book but tends to have more time for listening to audiobooks while commuting, and had no idea that I was not receiving the entire book until it arrived.
B00005QZWI|2.0|Never, never leave it to cinematic quasi-visionaries to render the audio landscape of a timeless masterpiece of literature!  Resigning to the tired old dose of John Williams-meets-Richard Wagner-meets-Carl Orff-meets-choir boys (hasn't this been done, like, a hundred times before?)did absolutely nothing for this soundtrack.  Ho hum, how creative.  It captures virtually none of the sublime tapestry of LOTR.  Boys choir over symphony tracks?  Come on!  How tired and formulaic can you get?  What a terrible treatment for these films.  This soundtrack has George Lucas/Steven Spielberg production written all over it, which is not a good thing considering the subject matter.  I half-expected to hear Jar Jar Binks say &quot;Me-sa so sorry!&quot; at the end of this CD.  The tracks by Enya are the only saving grace.  She should have produced the entire album, at least she appears to have a clue what the forlorn world of LOTR looks, feels, and sounds like.  Since I like to offer recommendations whenever I apply criticism, let me say this: focusing more on pure, elemental vocals, singular (or non-complex) instrumentals, and enhanced nature modals would have been a vast improvement over the symphonic tone-and-blast technique...wait a minute, I just described Enya to a tee!  As I was saying...
B00005QDW1|5.0|What else is there to say? No Doubt cannot do anything wrong. Is it me or do all their songs really kick (...)? No I'm right.

0385335482|4.0|I read this book right after finishing Bridget Jones's Diary and I must say, these English girls do go in for the perfect fairy tale ending!  I give this book 4 stars for its high fun quotient and its realistic portrayal of addiction--the lying, justification, denial, cut-and-run tactics, the whole bit.  I know!<br />In spite of not particularly liking the main character (I can't stand women whose only priority is how fabulous they look; too shallow for me), I found myself rooting for her when she stood up for herself or finally got honest about something.  Granted, it didn't happen very often.  Perhaps it's a credit to the author to create a character I could emotionally buy into; maybe I'm a sucker.  Either way, I wanted this crazy girl to snap out of it and get herself together.<br />While the laughs in this book aren't as many as in &quot;Bridget,&quot; it's still pretty funny, and several episodes are complete gut-busters.  Buy this book for yourself and all the compulsive shoppers in your life!
B00003CXTG|2.0|This film tries to be a Titanic but fails miserably.  Kate Beckinsale is unbelievable as a nurse with flowing long hair (?) For a war film it is too melodramatic to succeed.
B00005QDW1|4.0|No Doubt's Rock Steady is a great disc worthy of adding to your collection. It has the tracks their playing on the radio &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and those songs are great. The CD also contains a couple other noteworthy songs like &quot;Hella Good&quot; and &quot;Making Out&quot; which are also very nice. Overall, a great CD for the superfan and first time listener. Good, Good
B00003CY0V|1.0|Try and get this - a hacker who's been banned from going anywhere near a computer for more than a year, manages to hack into a DOD mainframe protected by 128 bit encryption security, ... with a Dell laptop, while being given a blowjob at the same time... <br />The film lost me after that...
0671027379|4.0|For those who like to figure out who done it before the book reveals it, this one will give you a good work out. The plot got a little too complex with sublots that were more distracting than enhancing but it all comes together in the end.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Absolutely hilarious!!!  Laughed practically the whole way through the whole movie.  Terrific job by actors, producers, directors.....can't say enough.  My wife and I loved this movie. We agreed ... this is one of the best movies we've ever seen.  She said the music reminded her of her grandmother many years ago singing in the car.  My wife requested one of the songs, I'll Fly Away, to be sung at her Mom's funeral this past February..... Anyway, this is definitely a keeper!!!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Imagine if you will, a world without happiness, joy, or love. This is the world of anyone who has yet to purchase this DVD, and is clearly the reason why the reviewer below (&quot;Another DVD release???, November 21, 2001&quot;) is so bitter - he has not seen the Almost Famous Bootleg Edition, and as a result his heart beats not warm, red blood, but cold, think black oil, like chocolate, only not tasty.<br />Almost Famous Bootleg Edition is the result of Cameron Crowe's hours of work reediting the film to add content, plus adding extras and commentary - this DVD was done for no other reason than for the fans, the people who will buy this set. The reason the first disc wasn't this 'feature packed' is because Cameron Crowe was a little busy directing a movie, not sitting around all day writing negative Amazon reviews from his parents basement on discs he doesn't even own.<br />Please, ignore this person, buy this DVD, and bring yourself a world of joy.
0060278234|5.0|I thought this was a great book. About Lirael, a child of the Clayr, and the oldest one who hasn't gained sight of the future yet. It is about her journey from the Clayr's Glacier across the Old Kingdom with the Prince.
B000000WA4|5.0|Probably THE best guitar album of the 90's. I like it as much as ELECTRIC LADYLAND. I love it that it is a double album! The older Pumpkins-albums now sound a bit dated to me; this one probably will remain standing up. This is a bust-buy for guitar-lovers...! Play it loud.

0671781383|5.0|I've read this book at least three times and still feel it's worth reading again.  Viktor Frankl's wisdom is profound and his experience in the Nazi concentration camp helped him understand the meaning of life.  It's a must read!
B000002HH2|5.0|.first one i came across but i was young: the ones i didn't know were difficult listening.<br />.but many years later:  this is the one that is the most intensely personal, the most varied, the most raw and bloody and beautiful.  debut is young and cool but dance-y, in the non-dance-y way for me, sometimes, and homogenic is haaardcore sometimes.<br />but gosh, this is alone and funny and kitschy and sunny and intense.  the videos make them more so.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I saw this movie not thinking I would like it because of its homoerotic content.  But I have to say that even being a perfectly regular straight guy who is not into cross dressing movies, this is still a great movie.  It is a funny movie.  It is also a movie that deals with issues of what it means to be masculine and what it means to be different.  Hedwig, seems to be at first glance to be a gay character, but it as the story reveals, it is not about being gay or straight it, it is about love and accepting who one is.  Hedwig asks himself who is is perfect partner and what they would look like.  The movie examines the issue of finding one's own person, not necessarily being gay or being straight.  Hedwig at the end defines himself as a person and comes to grips with that realization.  That is what the movie is about.  Plus it benefits from really good music.  A definite must see.

B000000YBQ|5.0|This is the &quot;other&quot; half of the Vanguard sessions which also produced the equally essential _Sunday At The Village Vanguard_.  You need both of these albums to appreciate what went down on June 25, 1961!  Whereas _Sunday_'s cuts were selected to feature bass monster Scott La Faro in light of his famous passing ten days later, _Waltz for Debby_ reveals the trio's more &quot;typical&quot; dynamics.  (There's still plenty of La Faro, and it's all still infused with that ghostly power of hindsight).<br />The gorgeous title tune was a favorite of Bill's, but he wasn't the only one: this tune routinely makes the cut into fake books alongside well-worn standards.  &quot;Some Other Time&quot; was another recurring, deeply introspective vehicle for the late pianist, and a delicious treat to hear live with the infamous trio (including La Faro on a monstrous-sounding bass) for comparison to the solo studio version in mono that's been added to the CD issue of _Everybody Digs Bill Evans_.  Porgy makes for a wonderful closing touch.<br />My &quot;close second&quot; favorite on this album is &quot;My Romance,&quot; both versions, on the CD issue.  Even more than the rest of the album, Bill fully unveils that vintage, impossibly sweet touch of his on this tune.  You know the rare time when you hear a version by someone other than the songwriter, shivers hit your spine, and you suddenly realize, &quot;my God, *that*'s the definitive conception of this tune!!&quot; ?  Well, sink your teeth into this one.<br />But if there is one supreme tune on this album that never fails to overwhelm, it is this trio's immensely haunting version of &quot;Milestones.&quot;  Don't get me wrong, I love Miles' original on _Milestones_.  But Bill's transformation of it, aided and abetted with such wonderful rhythmic tension by La Faro, stands a mighty chance of warping your powers of perception, permanently.  There's a magic and a hunger in it that just resonate so fully with the soul;  I don'tknow how else to put it.  And the group fades it out--live, mind you--with the most subtle, heartwrenching, perfectly executed fade I've ever heard.<br />Drummer Paul Motian is the least flashy of the trio, but provides ample atmospheric support for the other two monsters, and quite frankly, I like his brushwork on this album better than on _Sunday at the Village Vanguard_.<br />Don't mind some of the criticisms about the sound quality of this album--sure, there's plenty of background restaurant ambience with plates, waitstaff, patrons running their mouth instead of listening to one of the greatest trios of all time.  The music is nonetheless plenty up front and will quickly dominate your attention.  Unlike some other reviewers, I find that producer Orrin Keepnews and engineer David Jones did a hell of a good job given technology, the gig's environment and perhaps other constraints in 1961.  In an age obsessed with recent remasters of widely varying quality, the digital remastering of this album in *1987* by Joe Tarantino is plenty capable of holding its own.<br />Bottom line:  if you're looking for pulsing hard bop, this ain't it.  If you're looking for a quiet jewel by an otherworldly piano trio, you just hit the motherlode.  Buy it, and stop thinking about it!
B00005QDW1|5.0|Being a No Doubt fan for only about 3 years I don't have the real early stuff (However it is on Order).  The entire CD has &quot;happy music&quot; it would fit perfectly on a beach with a foo-foo dirnk in hand then get up and shake your back side.  So far my favorite is &quot;Underneath it All&quot; track 5 and &quot;Start the Fire&quot; track 8.  The music is great, and the shot of the very hot Gwen's bare midriff on the back on the CD case doesn't hurt either.
B00005R23S|5.0|The exuberance Bruce and his band show for their craft (what they are doing and why), the joy of living, the blood under the fingernails as we go through life are all brought to this emotion we all call music and through technology, to this DVD. Combine this emotion with video that is dead-on perfect and a 6.1 HTS and you have what will be the benchmark for all future Concert Vids for a very long time. I own several, and none measures up to the emotional intensity that Springsteen is able to transmit to the audience (live or the viewer of this DVD). This particular DVD is a remarkable achievement.  <br />If this were solely visual art, Springsteen's concert would be Picasso. Together as video and audio, it is sheer joy to too many sensory perceptors. This DVD is meant to be played over and over again and will in time become a classic, if it already isn't.
B00001OH7X|5.0|seen by most as the weakest album in bowie's trilogy with brian eno ('low' and 'heroes,' being the first two), 'lodger,' nontheless is a vital album in bowie's carreer, and was yet another of his premonitions for music to come, since the classic, 'scary monsters,' could not have been made without this album.<br />although rather listless at times, 'lodger,' is full of great, often fun songs. there is plenty of keyboard experimentation (the best track of which is easily, 'repetition,') but there is also a vital return to his use of soulful, dancable beats and the stripped down rock 'n' roll he so obviously loves. the three songs that best portray his departure are the sensuous, 'dj,' the frantic (and even harrowing) beats of, 'look back in anger,' and the simply wonderful, 'boys keep swinging,' an invigorating little camp rocker that hints at bowie's infamous gay undertones.<br />this is almost it, the second to last album of bowie's career that really, really matters. necessary for any bowie fan.
1587990717|1.0|A surprisingly large amount of this book seems to be devoted to settling personal scores and building up the author's ego.  These parts are particularly distasteful and prevented me from taking the book seriously.  <br />The discussions of probability are, for the most part, fairly rudimentary.  Some, no doubt, will gain from them.  <br />There are far more enlightening books around.
6302121876|3.0|The acting is the strong point of this version of Don Giovanni. The real trouble is that though the singing seems quite well done, particularly the male roles, the sound quality is really poor.  It is probably worth watching just to see the excellient way Siepi plays the Don, but the soprano voices particularly suffer from the acoustics and/or the recording.  The orchestra is often recorded too far forward which also obscures the vocals.  Really, your purchase of this video will depend more on whether the historical interest is enough to offset the very real deficiencies in the sound.
B000002L9J|5.0|There is popular myth, perpetuated by UK music journalists, that Strangeways Here we Come is the pinnacle of Smith's achievement and a superior recording to Queen is Dead. Well, sorry but if you use your ears rather than whatever it is music journalists seem to be equipped with, not only does Queen is Dead have better songs, it has better everything else, too.<br />With the exception of the title track, this album is genius at work, and shows the band at its creative peak. End of story.<br />The Queen is Dead cruises effortlessly through a variety of styles without ever losing its homogeneity, the whole record's concept being congealed by a crisp production, Johnny Marr's sparkling guitar work and Morrissey's black-humour lyrics and deadpan delivery. Standout tracks for me is the jaunty Frankly Mr. Shankly, which will indeed &quot;go down in musical history&quot;, and the definitive Smiths tearjerker, There is a Light that Never Goes Out. Other highlights include Bigmouth Strikes Again, Some Girls are Bigger Than Others, The Boy with a Thorn in his Side and...well...take your pick. Beginners will find this album a good, accessible introduction to the UK's best band of the 80s. If you like this, Hatful of Hollow - a compilation of the best early stuff - is also indispensable. Enjoy.
B000002UB3|2.0|The beatles were good for what they were,which is a silly little pop band whose music is the eqivalent of junk food(as is the case with pop music in general).In its genre this album is among the best,but then again that isn't saying much.I've come to the conclusion that pop music and the trifling nonsense of pop culture in general is designed for adolescents and people who never grow up,and the beatles are no exception.The symptoms of too much ingestion of pop culture is a degradation of culture and brain rot for those who've spent a lifetime ingesting whatever flotsam is thrown out for public consumption.The beatles fall into the same category as NSync and the other vapid and childish trifles so prevalent today.Look at some of the beatles songs:&quot;polythene Pam&quot;?! &quot;Mean mr.Mustard&quot;?! &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;?!Never has a band gotten away with having so little substance as these guys.&quot;Come together&quot;?I cannot stomach these ridiculous lyrics and tiring gimmicks.When you break it down the beatles were nothing besides gimmicks,that and hype that exceeded all rationality.I sincerely believe that the prerequisites for liking the beatles is a total lack of musical taste and an I.Q. that hovers somewhere around 50,which,by the way, is about the typical age of those who keep these darlings of irrelevence alive.I mean listen to their lyrics,or lack therof.Half their lyrics consist of screams,yelps,yea yea yea,ya ya heh heh,na na,yay yay,la da da da da etc ad nauseam.For god sakes, if aliens landed on our extinct planet 1,000,000 years from now and the only thing they found was a beatles album,and if they found a way to play it they would have to draw the conclusion that no intelligent life ever existed on our planet.<BR>There is so much great music out there it seems to be a crime to waste time listening to some played out pop farts whose music is on the intellectual level of a 15 year old.Go listen to Bach,Chopin,Miles Davis,Mahler,Beethoven,Shostakovich,Debussy,Gershwin,Haydn,Mozart,Scriabin or any countless number of REAL musicians and composers who made music for people past the age of 15.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I can't imagine why Sir Anthony Hopkins agreed to make this movie!  Calling it a sequel to Silence of the Lambs is ludicrous.  It's no suspence, all gore.  If you're into seeing lots of blood and disgusting displays of cannibalism -- this film is for you.  If you're lookling for a good suspenseful thriller, skip Hannibal.  Jody Foster clearly made the right choice in skipping this one!
B000000WJZ|5.0|The incredibly beautiful mood created on this album is nothing short of remarkable.Unlike other Pumpkin albums which are disjointed and don't really flow,this one is coherent from start to finish.How do these guys manage to create such gorgeous sounds?The cello on &quot;Disarm&quot; is a magical touch to an already unbearably beautiful song.The parade of pretty continues with other mini masterpieces like &quot;Soma',&quot;Spaceboy&quot;,&quot;Sweet sweet&quot; and &quot;Luna&quot;.The band has been called pretentious,arty and other unpleasant things, but I thought the point of ART is to create a magical world full of the sublime and surreal.The world is full of the base,gross and obvious so why do people denigrate something that for a little while at least,can take you away from all of it?Sure the Pumpkins are not to be taken in large doses,but for a boost to the dreamer in you and to the imagination they are a source to come back to again and again.
B000002MFN|5.0|This album was, and has been ever since, overlooked and forgotten.  That is so unfair because this is my all-time favorite Madonna album and, in my personal opinion has to be at least her second best, if not first.  The whole album has a sort of underground feel to it, but it also has hip-hop inspiration behind it.  It flows beautifully and when it gets to Deeper And Deeper, WOW!  My favorite Madonna song of all time!  EROTICA has so much to offer and those who have heard it know why.  This album wasn't made to shock people (as many think), nor is it the soundtrack to the SEX book (as many think).  What it is is Madonna at her best.  Madonna is one of the few female artists who writes and co-produces her own material, (...) Buy this-or any Madonna-album.  She's the real deal and the best!!!
B00000G3PA|1.0|Is this a video game or a movie?With an endless stream of flashing lights,explosions,two dimensional characters and a plot as about as realistic as a video game I really couldn't tell one way or the other.This is one of the most viscerally unpleasant things ever set loose on the public.After about an hour of having your eyes,ears and intelligence assaulted by this beast full of sound and fury that signifies nothing,you'll be crying: no more! no more! Dear god just make it stop! You will like this so-called movie if your age and I.Q. are somewhere around 16.Otherwise don't bother.It gets my vote for the worst movie ever made,and I've seen Attack of the killer tomatoes and Howard the Duck.
B000002LNF|5.0|(...) It's absolutely essential for not just Madonna fans, but music fans in general. This album has sold over 22 MILLION copies worldwide, and all those people can't be wrong! This is pop music at it's very best and most truest form. From \\"Holiday\\" to \\"Rescue Me\\" (17 hits total, 15 of which are Top 10 Billboard Singles), The Immaculate Collection is just that--FLAWLESS!! TEN STARS!!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a good, immensely viewable movie, both for children and adults, which is no mean feat. 3D computer generated graphics are used to great effect. The overall result is that of a very well polished cartoon depicting a fairy tale story world with a modern twist. This movie is irreverent and a little savage, which, again goes down well both with children and adults. There are a lot of nods to other movies, including the &quot;that'll do&quot; phrase out of &quot;Babe&quot;. Myself a counted half a dozen such instances and probably they are twice as many - this works nicely. To its merit the movie does not take itself very seriously.<br />Unfortunately its makers do; the special features are filled with expressions such as &quot;the first&quot;, &quot;the most&quot;, &quot;revolutionary not evolutionary&quot;, &quot;the only one with believable human characters&quot; and such. In fact Shrek is evolutionary only, if you want to have a revolutionary visual experience, see &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, a contemporary photo realistic computer generated movie. &quot;Shrek&quot; for all its merits, does not quite achieve what &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;A Bug's Life&quot; did: to create a new world. On the other hand Shrek is a polished, clever, entertaining piece of work and will probably become a classic.
B00005JCCE|5.0|Very inspiring, specially for those of us involved in the visitation of patients.  It really gives us some perspective and some &quot;soul&quot; in the art of patient visitation.  This is a &quot;must&quot;, not only for future doctors, but also for future ministers, priests and rabbis.
B00005Q5WC|5.0|a college favorite i never grew tired of. of course, i couldn't possibly complain about an entire album's worth of bonus tracks, its meticulous 24bit remastering and it's superb packaging could i?<br />remastered reissues are often considered poor excuses for record companies to make money.<br />i don't have problems with this one this time.
B000001GQU|5.0|This CD was recorded in 1954 at Jesus Christus Kirche in no-apologies, first-rate mono.  The remastering is wonderful, and the modern listener needs little in the way of adjustment to the sound, which some modern engineers would do well to emulate. It is also 75 minutes long and is nicely contained on one disc.<br />But enough of recording technique.  The star of this CD is the performance, which requires words like burning, rapturous, shimmering, breathlessly urgent, and thrilling.  I can hardly describe how delighted I have been with this CD over the last few years, or what a surprise it was to hear a performance of such intensity and transcendance that it wiped the two-disc digital recordings I had previously heard completely from my memory. I love Fricsay and company's reading as I have never loved Verdi before.
0385501560|2.0|I am constnalty mixed in my thoughts of Mr. Palahniuk an his writing ability. His thoughts are grand, his abilities are limited.Fight Club was far better on screen then on papaer. Survivor was an interesting satire and is one of the best of his 4 books.  My favorite is Invisible Monsters because it had so much to say, and said it so well. You actually begin to feel for the main character who is forced to muffle her voice because half of her face is missing. And it had plenty of twists that made me very happy. This book on th other hand was just Mr. Palahniuk trying to continue his shock-writing for one last thrill, and it has as much excitement as a low grade porno film. It seems like all he is trying to do is shock us into being interested rather then creating interesting characters. YOu have no sympahty for this pathetic sex addict with a bad mother. Boo-Hoo By the end we could care less, and are more digusted with all the graphic details that were very unecessary. <br />in the end, what was the point?  Invisible Monsters had comments on inner beauty, our cultures view of beauty, and materialism. That was his first book written before Fight Club. It seems he has lost his sense of wanting to convey a message, and just wants to either be gross or funny.
B000001GS0|4.0|This set contains monaural recordings from the 1950's well-remastered and well worth having.<br />The main reasons for me to recommend this set are the truly extaordinary readings of the First and Second Symphonies.  Jochum, who is justly famous for his turbulently intense Bruckner symphonies, conducts his Brahms in the same manner.  The result is much greater elasticity of tempo than is ordinarily heard in these imposing works, more intense climaxes, and some exceedingly fleet playing.  I would venture to say that Michael Jordan leading the Bulls to a last minute victory had nothing on Jochum leading these Berliner's through the final pages of the Second at such harrowing speed with such furious precision.  If this were live, the audience would hardly be able to remain seated or silent.<br />The Third and Fourth Symphonies are zippy and well-played, but not my preferred versions.  The Third is a little annoying on headphones because of some musicianly snorting.
B00005NWRS|5.0|I got this cd a couple of months ago, and I loved it! I know that everybody is saying &quot;It's not Whiskeytown!&quot; but hey, every musician deserves to explore new territory, and that is just what Gold does.  In fact, it he had written Stranger's Almanac over again, I would not have been pleased...because music is not static. Anyway, as far as the album goes, the influences are far and wide, and each song (yes, EACH song) reminds me of something that I love. And call me a sap, but I am a huge sucker for &quot;When the Stars Go Blue.&quot; Plus, I just saw Ryan in concert last week, and it was AWESOME! And it made me love Gold even more.
B000007ODY|5.0|If you like your Brahms in a melancholy mode, lushly recorded and nuanced to the max,(and I do!), this Brahms is for you.  Karajan's approach is to these four symphonies so unified as to perhaps be regarded and overdetermined and sterile, but for me they evoke a variety of emotions that few other recordings do, and there are times when I listen to both CD's at a sitting, finishing, with the peerless Third.  It's a fine experience.
B000002ADT|5.0|I've been listening to this album for over forty years, since before I graduated from high school.  Imagine my pleasure when my son, taking a intro jazz improv class in college, told me that everyone in the class was required to buy this CD, the quintessential introduction to jazz improvisation.
B00005RIKD|5.0|The thing I love about Sting is that he always puts a new slant on things.  His music is always fresh and new, even the old stuff!   Keep up the great work.
B00005QIPH|1.0|What album could live up to the pre-release hype? Very few, even so, this album fell short of my expectations. I like the gritty performances, but the songs themselves are no good. They are probably a good band to see live, but this album does not reflect that. The more I listened to it, the more I realized that it is a bit &quot;fruitcake&quot;. Beware of any band that has been embraced by New York Glitteratti as this band has been. It's different than the rock garbage on the radio today, but different is not always better. <br />Prediction: they will fade out in two years.
B00000K0DT|5.0|Definitely one of the best movies of all time.<BR>Once again, Kevin Spacey (Se7en, American Beauty) delivers a performance deserving of Academy Awards... and the ending will leave you gaping unbelievingly at the screen on your first viewing and simply NEEDING to watch the whole thing again.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt return to the public eye with a brilliant new album, featuring a vast array of different styles, influences, and collaborations. In general, the mood is a departure from the darker Return of Saturn. The 1st track, &quot;intro&quot;, gives an indication of the vibe of the album to come; Happy. The computer generated sounds make their welcome debut towards the end of track 1, which fades away like the sun setting on the carribean sea. Hella Good opens with an incredibley funky bass line with a disco feel, reminiscent of Tragic Kingdom's &quot;You can do it&quot;. The chorus is wild and makes you want to break into the saturday night fever dance. The synth at the start of &quot;hey baby&quot; continues the funky vibe that is becoming most apparent in this record. The horny dancehall song describes back-satge goings on with humour and zest. The chorus is brilliant to sing-along to, and Bounty Killer's rap just adds to the jamaican feel of this song. &quot;Making out&quot; is another clasic disco style tune, with a very sexy feel to it. It is obvious now that chief lyricist Gwen Stefani is more comfortable about her role as a sexy person. In fact Gwen seems to be more confident all round. <BR>&quot;Underneath it all&quot; is an up-beat reggae ballad produced by the legendary Sly and Robbie, and featuring a brilliant section by Lady Saw. This is another example of how far no dount have progressed relationship-wise since Return of Saturn. Gavin seems to be seen in a more favourable light, and I can't help but feel overjoyed that Gwen and Gavin are so happy together. &quot;Detective&quot; reverts somewhat to the paranioa and insecurity of Return of Saturn, but this tie there is a hip hop vibe- including vinyl crackling effects and a plick pluck guitar sound similar to that used by Dr. Dre. A return to the more rocky ways of old No Doubt is found on &quot;Don't let me down&quot;, produced by Ric Okasec. The tune is simple and the synths add to the positive feel of the song. The chorus is memorable and you find yourself singing it at any oppertunity.<BR>&quot;Start the fire&quot; is not one of the most amazing tracks on the album, but it is still brilliant in it's own right. The march beat is easy to dance to and you will find yourself grooving along to it in no time!! The chours sounds so laid back and dreamy, and the vocals are like those of Blondie's Debbie Harry- no bad thing at all!! The vintage keyboard intro of &quot;running&quot; sounds sweet and like an old nintendo game. The lyrics, the crystal vocals, and the sixties like chord progression, make me want to cry with a kind of happiness and admiration at how much Gwen loves Gavin. The lyrics are so open and the lyrics are beautifully honest that the listener feels like no doubt are their personal friends. &quot;In my head&quot; is another potential hit, again with a funky reggae vibe and a lot of synth. Paranoia crops up again, when Gwen questions her own judgement, and asks why she gets so suspicious. <BR>&quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; is rocky, this time with a bluesy lo-fi feel, with an intro similar to that of New York anti-folk duo, The Moldy Peaches, and with a nod to the current hype; The White Stripes. There are still a lot of clasic Tom Dumont guitar flicks and effects, which remind us that they are still the same band underneath. Prince contributes vocals to the jungle/drum'n'bass/soul fusion that is called &quot;Waiting room&quot;. The beat is incredibley danceable and the chorus is incomplete contrast to the verses. This is as far out No Doubt gets, and it is still brilliant. The album closes on &quot;Rock Steady&quot;- a beautiful reggae ballad with all the computer noises and Tony's typically funky bass. The feel is atmospheric and trippy, and the flickers of hammond organ give it an anthemic yet laid back vibe. This is No Doubt at their best; Rocking Steady without the rock. 10 out of 10!
0743420373|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door makes some excellent points about the way people utilize money.  Basically it boils down to a question of whether you want to have a lot of money or look like you have a lot of money.  The differences between &quot;new money&quot; and &quot;old money&quot; are interesting as are most of the stories describing the frugal millionaires vs. those concerned with status at any cost.<br />I did find portions of the book too number-intensive.  Often after a point is made, scores and scores of charts, figures, and analysis will follow.  It makes for some pretty dry reading.<br />The bottom line is that this book can be utilized as an excellent resource for pulling your personal finance goals together.   However, skip ahead when the numbers really start flying!
B00003CXC6|5.0|Just wanted to let peole know that criterion has this film listed for a march release on dvd.  for people who love it as much as i do, this is one of the biggest dvd releases in a while.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Gwen Stefani and friends are back with the brand new ROCK STEADY. After the flop of RETURN OF SATURN, No Doubt make it a point that they've returned to top form. ROCK STEADY is awesome! It's their best effort since TRAGIC KINGDOM (which is still an all time fave of mine). Gwen's never sounded better. She's back with her playful/clever (yet honest) lyrics (also co-written by Tony Kanal &amp; Tom Dumont) and quirky vocals. The vibe on here is FUN! It's a party album with a tropical/summer feel. It's upbeat and sonically satisifying. ROCK STEADY is filled with pop infused dance-hall/reggae, rock and 80's synth elecronica. No Doubt's most soncically daring album to date. This is an awesome blend and it's perfectly mixed. Producers include No Doubt, Nellee Hooper, William Orbit, and others. Gwen really got her fun, party/playful attitude back with this one. She also offers a sexy side on some tracks. ROCK STEADY flows very well with the uptempos but it also includes a softer side. Tracks like &quot;running&quot; are light and dreamy. Other gems include &quot;hella good&quot;, &quot;hey baby&quot;, &quot;making out&quot;, &quot;dective&quot;, &quot;rock steady&quot; and others. ROCK STEADY truly rocks -- no doubt about it!
B00005NWM3|5.0|This CD is awesome.  Many people are putting them down for being angry like all the other bands out today.  I think thats bull because they wrote about their lives and things going on in the world today.  I'm not a big fan of angry music but thid cd only is angry on about 3 songs.  They don't sound the same as many other bands do.  They have amazing riffs, maybe not as good as The State had, but the reason they probably didn't is because The State wasn't picked up like this cd.  I think The State was better because they experimented more.  I don't understand why it wasn't big, but less talk about The State and more about Silver Side Up.<BR>Silver Side Up is a great CD.  It had many hard songs and two slow songs.  The Hard songs are awesome they have many guitar hooks and lyric hooks.  All the songs are great but the two slow songs are amazing they are both legendary.  How you remind me the big hit right now is awesome with soem of the best lyrics today.  Good Times Gone is the other slow song and it has a led zeppelin sound, It's a amazing song but it will not be a number one hit because the radios won't play and people won't listen to it because its too good for them really.  The generation i'm in mostly don't like the beatles for some reason or any of the really great music of all time.  This song and this band ranks up with them but will never be seen that way becuase of this (...) generation.  NICKELBACK is awesome and legendary but will not be because this stupid generation.  People say music is dead, music is not dead this generation is not playing it for some dumb reason.  If you want a great cd from amazng band buy this cd.<BR>Also take a look at Stone Temple Pilots, Creed, Train, Lenny Kravitz, and Smashing Pumpkins these are just a few of the other great bands of this time that don't get listend to like they should.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|I avoided this movie when it was released in the cineplex last summer.  I love action movies but this seemed to be just Angelina Jolie running around in spandex.  A guy's movie only.<br />I rented it out of boredom recently and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.  Angelina is very likeable as Lara Croft, an adventurous archeologist in the tradition of Indiana Jones.  There isn't too much of a story line but the locations and special effects are fantastic.<br />Angelina is also supported by a great cast!  Chris Barrie is great as her caring Butler.  Iain Glenn is sexy and scary at the same time.  Daniel Craig is adorable as Lara's wayward boyfriend, she stops time to save.  Her scenes with Jon Voight (her real life dad) are very tender.<br />The DVD is also packed with great features and commentary.
0553260111|5.0|Reading the Bourne Identity is one hell of an experience. Ludlum is at his best here. As you slowly unravel the mind of Jason Bourne, the plot gets thicker &amp; thicker. A gripping story coupled with fantastic action &amp; beautiful characters, this book is worth preserving for years! <BR>Close your eyes &amp; order for this book!
B000059XYM|1.0|The Wayans need to take a lesson from the Farrellys the next time they do a gross-out movie.  The difference is the Farrellys never tend to stereotype people and they know how to do a really good gross out comedy while being in good taste.  The Wayans, on the other hand, force people to laugh at people being brutally murdered and X-rated sex jokes. (In my opinion, \\"Scary Movie\\" should be X-rated.) <BR>One good thing though:  It makes fun of the Budwiser commercials.(Hint:  WASSSSSSSSSSSSUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP)<BR>(...)
B00005RFQ5|5.0|The Rainbow Children is absolutely a fantastic album by a fantastic artist. It is nothing like his previous albums.  I read several reviews regarding the lyrics.  I must say I didn't feel like Prince was preaching to me.  This shows where he is as a person.  Prince takes you on a musical journey through jazz,funk, and rock.  What really saddens me about some of the negative reviews is that it is based on the religious content of the album.  Some say Prince is lost.  According to some, Prince has been lost since the Dirty Mind album.  What is really funny about all of this is that Prince can talk about incest and having sex in all kinds of positions and receives praises for it.<BR>On the Rainbow Children, he talks about getting in touch with God and learning to get along as a whole.  With that message, he is considered lost.  Prince is no longer in his 20's. He is now 43 years old.  His message continues to evolve as well as his music.  Prince is maturing and I think fans or admirers need to also.
0345413377|5.0|Wow ... i can only hope that my writing (when i grow up) is half as good as Philip Pullman's!!! All three books were really good, and the last one is extra long which is perfect for me!  I honestly dont know where Philip Pullman's imagination comes from, he must be some kind of genius.  =D  Highly reccommended!(...)
B000002UKS|3.0|I noticed the relatively high average rating for this CD, and I must say I am a bit surprised. If you own all of the Foo Fighters' albums like me, I'd be surprised if you called this their best. They seem to lack a solid good sound here. On &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; (the originial album by Grohl), there was a hard, punk sound with VERY good melodies (best are found on &quot;Floaty&quot; and &quot;I'll Stick Around;&quot; I'd recommend this album highly). After this album on &quot;Nothing Left To Lose,&quot; the Foos switched to a softer sound but continued to crank out good melodies in four-minute rockers like &quot;Breakout&quot; and &quot;Gimme Stitches.&quot;<br />But here it is, the middle album, and I am not overly pleased with it. The opener is obviously filler, followed by a string of four good songs. &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; and &quot;My Poor Brain&quot; are notably good here. The middle of the album (tracks 6 through 10) feature only one very strong song, the single &quot;My Hero.&quot; The last three songs are all quite good, though, especially &quot;Walking After You.&quot;<br />What's very interesting to me is that so many people seem to love the song &quot;Everlong&quot; and even call it the Foos' best song! I personally would consider this song among the weak tracks on the album, and definitely not near the Foos' best of all Cds.<br />In conclusion, Foo Fighter fans who really like their sound should definitely give this a listen. If you are general, casual rock fan like me who listens to a wide range of rock from Radiohead to Incubus to Metallica, this is far from a highlight in 90s rock. Check out &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; instead.
B00005JCA9|4.0|Notting Hill is a pleasant movie that presents some interesting moments making it a soft movie.<BR>In spite of being a romantic story, the movie presents some comedy parts, mainly offered by Spike, starred by Rhys Ifans.<BR>The contradictions of the romance follow the same path, a couple with different kinds of life and job, different economic levels, but with non-defined futures that could come along.<BR>The love begins when Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) an American movie star visits a travel bookstore in England and is attended<BR>by William Thacker (Hugh Grant), the owner.<BR>From this moment on the meeting becomes frequent, but with problems caused by Anna's professional liabilities and by journalists that want news about her relationships.<BR>Some small parts could be improved, like a moment when Anna, who is wearing only a borrowed shirt from William, answers William's front door and is photographed by journalists. This would never happen in real life, a famous actress wouldn't be that naive.<br />The story isn't great, there aren't beautiful set photos and the production is rather normal to a Julia Roberts' movie.<BR>Even so it is a worth watching movie.
B000002J1B|5.0|My favorite Yes album is TTO, but this is a very close second.  Many people discount this album becaue Rick W. isn't on it.  That's ok it gives Steve Howe more room to work.  Sound Chaser is one of the best rock songs they have ever done, and Gates of Delerium is an epic poem set to music.  I never tire of listening to it.  To be Over is much weaker than the other songs, not so much in song writing, but in the performance.  The production is not quite up to standard, but this does not detract (this is quite an admission for an audio engineer)  I recently had all of my CD's stolen (someone cut a sunroof in my convertable) so I have been slowly rebuilding my collection.  Since I replaced &quot;Gates&quot; I have re-discovered what an enjoyable listen this is.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I thought that I had viewed at least every episode twice, but I bought this collection just in case (and for a girls night). What a surprise to find three shows that I had never seen before. The DVD doesn't offer a lot of extra material--just the original commercials and the original HBO Behind-the-Scenes show. Great fun to watch either by yourself or with friends.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul McCartney is a master songwriter, every bit Lennon's equal but different stylistically.  For someone who's spent his entire career singing about peace and love, the anthemic &quot;might makes right&quot; sing-a-long &quot;Freedom&quot; is an ironic return to radio for McCartney.  Not since 1984's &quot;No More Lonely Nights&quot; has a new Macca song received so much airplay -- a shame, given the quality of the FLOWERS IN THE DIRT and FLAMING PIE albums -- and while &quot;Freedom&quot; is a powerful song, regardless of your idealogy, it's also highly reactionary.  The World Trade Center attacks were tragic, but so was the war in Viet Nam.  (In fact, if u strictly consider the death count, Viet Nam was worse, yet McCartney retained an anti-war stance throughout that dark period in history).<br />  Politics aside, DRIVING RAIN isn't really all that different from McCartney's overlooked 1986 disc, PRESS TO PLAY (**** 1/2), its sonic, experimental cousin.  Indeed, RAIN's rocking opener, &quot;Lonely Road,&quot; echoes the snare-kick jauntiness of &quot;Stranglehold,&quot; the stellar lead-off track from PRESS.  Both albums find McCartney in an experimental mood, with varied and interesting results.<br />  Obviously, much of DRIVING RAIN is open to interpretation, with McCartney dealing with the loss of his beloved Linda while finding his way &quot;Back in the Sunshine.&quot;  The poignant ballad &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; reveals a heartbreaking struggle to honour lovers past and finding the resolve to embrace new ones.  It's classic McCartney, as is the lovely and very Beatle-esque &quot;Magic.&quot;  &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot; is pure pop and would have fit in quite nicely on the aforementioned PRESS TO PLAY album, and &quot;About You&quot; is a fine McCartney rocker in the mold of RAM's &quot;Monkberry Moon Delight.&quot;  &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; makes for an uncharacteristically bleak and sinister-sounding detour in the Macca Songbook, but it works. &quot;Spinning on an Axis&quot; should have been relegated to a b-side, however, and &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; is a serviceable but dull ballad that veers uncomfortably close to Michael Bolton territory.<br />  All told however, DRIVING RAIN should please McCartney fans still eager to travel his Long and Winding Road.it works. &quot;Spinning on an Axis&quot; should have been relegated to a b-side, however, and &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; is a serviceable but dull ballad that veers uncomfortably close to Michael Bolton territory. <BR>     All told however, DRIVING RAIN should please McCartney fans still eager to travel his Long and Winding Road.
6300268470|2.0|Dean Martin? Ricky Nelson? Angie Dickinson? Must be some Vegas caper flick--but no, it's a Western! Well...<BR>John Wayne at his most self-righteous, a totally unconvincing supporting cast (although Walter Brennan makes an exemplary grizzled old sidekick, whoda thunkit)--this flick was a nail in the Western's coffin, not one of the great ones.<BR>One positive thing: this was remade as the way better &quot;El Dorado&quot; (try Robert Mitchum and James Caan instead of Dino &amp; Ricky, for starters).
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok so what's up with that guy that wrote the other reviews??!?!?!  Did he even LISTEN to it?!?  I don't understand because I think John Mayer is seriously the most amazing singer/songwriter/musician that I've ever heard.  I mean come on...his lyrics are sooooo beautifully written and easy for anyone to identify with.  My favorite song is \\"My Stupid Mouth\\"...its so clever, and I can totally relate.  I've had this cd for a month and its STILL playing non stop in my cd player.  Its always on.  Oh and I don't like Dave Matthews at all and I love John Mayer...so I don't think they're THAT much alike.  John Mayer is AMAZING....buy his cd.  Trust me you'll love it...plus you'll probably want to have his kids. Haha.
B00003CXTG|3.0|..leaves much to be desired. It is me, or did it feel like you could completely cut out the beginning of the movie with all that romance stuff which bogged the movie down. It was just way, way too long in the set up of the characters. Then the fact that the main female character loves one guy, then his friend, and then back to the original guy just seems kinda tacky especially for something that was set back in the 40's. I'd definitely skip all the character development parts as it was so boring and added nothing to the movie which should've focused more on the actual Pearl Harbor event. When the movie finally gets to it, it becomes more exciting and viable to watch. The special effects during this part are great and definitely top notch. This part is when you actually &quot;feel&quot; for the characters and all the suffering the victims of Pearl Harbor went through. It's definitely not a must see movie if you want a completely watchable movie. Just buy it to watch the Pearl Harbor seen and nothing else which thankfully is pretty long. The rest of the movie is forgettable like how Star Wars The Phantom Menace was only good during the Jedi fight scenes.
B000002UAU|4.0|While this album is a bona fide classic, the stereo mix used on the CD is far weaker than the mono mix supervised by the Fabs themselves in '67. No less an authority than John Lennon once stated that &quot;You haven't heard 'Pepper' if you haven't heard it in mono.'<br />Ideally, Capitol/EMI/Apple would reissue and remaster the entire Beatles catalog, including both the mono AND stereo mixes of each album on the CDs. Until that happens, I urge those who want to hear this album as it was MEANT to be heard to seek out a bootleg CD with the mono &quot;Pepper&quot; on it. Or, if you have a turntable, find a mono copy of the original vinyl LP. Trust me, it'll be a much more impressive listening experience.
B00005NWM3|2.0|I must confess that I was disappointed with this album after listening the whole album, Their first single &quot;How you remind me&quot; is indeed a nice catchy rock piece, which is the main reason why I bought this album. However the whole album is a disappointment. I was expecting a little better besides the single. I should have waited to buy the single CD, instead of the album.
0679882820|5.0|My son (now 3) is speech-delayed, and this is one of the first books that actually had him talking along! I would read, &quot;Oh, the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown can do. He can sound like a cow, he can go...&quot; and my son at 2 would yell &quot;MOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; and do the same with the other sounds! It ENCOURAGES your child to speak by having them make some silly sounds! We even came up with hand gestures for several of the sounds to supplement my son's sign language (ASL) he used at the time. We read this book every night at least 4 times before bed. As his speech flourished (yay!), he began to want to say more of the words himself (we've memorized the book - not hard, and very fun to recite when waiting in lines, etc, heeheehee). Then, we bought him the Dr. Seuss video of ABCs, which has this book's &quot;video&quot; at the end. He watches the video with this book in hand, although the video has a few more sounds (I think this board book is a bit abridged, but not too much), and is now learning to read with the video/board book combination! I am HIGHLY pleased with this book, from it's hilarious illustrations (see lightning/thunder page) to it's musical cadence and silly sounds - it helped my son realize sounds can be fun and silly and encouraged him to play with them when speech was so frustrating for him at the time.
B00005QK3W|3.0|I've always been a big fan of Paul McCartney.  Although his post-Beatles work is spotty, each album/disc has had its share of worthwhile songs.  Driving Rain is no exception. However, I can't agree with those reviewers who have described it as one of McCartney's best solo efforts.  McCartney's recent work has been fairly disappointing, so it's tempting to say that any above-average disc indicates that &quot;Paul is back.&quot;<br />Let's remember that this is the same McCartney who came out with 4 consecutive pop classics in the mid-70s - Band on the Run, Venus and Mars, Wings at the Speed of Sound, and London Town.  Even some of his most disappointing works have had a gem or two - I think of &quot;Waterfalls&quot; on the misnamed McCartney II album, or &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot; on Back to the Egg. <br />This disc has a lot in common with 1997's Flaming Pie.  The songs have a rough sound.  The guitar tracks are mostly distorted, and there are few horns or strings.  Some of the songs (such as &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; and &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot;) are just plain morose.  But he makes up for them with &quot;From A Lover to a Friend&quot; (the best song), &quot;Driving Rain&quot; and &quot;I Do.&quot;
B00005OMTT|4.0|Great CD to put on repeat, the end ties up nicely with the beginning and the middle moves from theme to them without any gaps. I really bought this CD because I wanted a copy of &quot;Return to Innocence,&quot; which brings back memories of the last Olympics and is a good song for starting the day. The only drawback of this is that it reminds me of the lawsuit that was going on in '98 filed by the eldery aboriginal Taiwanese couple whose voices appear on the track but were not acknowledged in the original Cross of Changes release. (I'm Taiwanese, by the way.) By the way, I think track #14, &quot;Push the Limits,&quot; is about the coolest thing I've ever heard, especially near the 3:00 mark.  I like track #15, &quot;Invisible,&quot; a lot too, though the female voice on this reminds me a little of the &quot;Survivor&quot; theme song.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I wouldn't consider this one of Pac's greatest, but it was very good. If you are a fan of Pac, add this to your collection as it does have the classic beats/rhythms we've come to associate with 2Pac. You won't be disappointed if you liked his other albums.
0790740443|5.0|I applaud the writer, director and star of Soldier - great work!<br />The story brought in some interesting concepts - something to think about.  Soldiers trained from birth - a life of incessant training and combat.  It makes you ask yourself questions.  How far off is this from the athletes from the primarily former Eastern Bloc who's life was geared around Olympic competition?  How far off is making newborns wards of the State and inducting them into this kind of life?  The story also asked the question: What does someone who has known nothing but military training and combat think and feel?  It's really something else.  Another thing that I was pleased to see was the triumph of Man over Technology.  While the new Soldiers are genetically superior to Dodd and his men, they lack the intuition, creativity, and combat experience that the &quot;old ones&quot; have.<br />The director's influence on the story was obvious in the use of story/plot over special effects (though they did exist).  Use of the camera was expert in such scenes as Dodd's flashback as he is using the large metal can as a punching bag - it comes as no surprise that out of instinct and pure reaction that he attacks the man who suddenly comes into the room.  Excellent setting of mood and building of suspense.<br />Kurt Russell himself plays an excellent character.  He pulls off alot of combinations that other actors may very well have shyed away from.  For example, he definitely put on some muscle for this film, but at the same time this hulking and scarred Soldier is at times terrified, compassionate, and paternal...all the while not coming out of the hardened state of the character. Bravo.<br />All in all, the untrained eye may see this as a low-budget sci-fi film (again, few special effects - sometimes the primary judging factor of a sci-fi film, sadly).  I, however, see this film as making a statement and showing off the style and skill of all involved.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|For the last 10 years, I've had a love/hate relationship with Whitney: sometimes I like her, and sometimes I don't.  Regardless, anyone interested in pop music should check out this video collection of Whitney's hits.  Some of the selections are dated (check out the killer weave in &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody&quot;) while others are tastefully done (&quot;You Give Good Love,&quot; &quot;I Learned From the Best,&quot; &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;).  This set also has lyrics to all the songs, concert footage, and a neat backstage trip to a promotional photo shoot.  Unlike other music DVDs, this one doesn't skimp on the extras, and there's enough bonus material to make Whitney fans and casual listeners like myself interested.
B000001EXR|5.0|This CD is way under-rated! It has killer crunches and cords. I absolutelty love Rain. And you can tell that the feel of this album is different. This is one of my Favorite KISS Cd's ever. Rock on!
B00005QATY|5.0|The movie was really good.  My father loved the movie also, so I am buying it for him for Christmas.  Both of us just loved the song the group of guys made up.  It is a movie that keeps you on the edge with some very funny parts.  I reccomend this movie very highly for anyone who enjoys movies set in the old times.

B00005RFQ5|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of Prince, but this album is amazing.  Almost all of Prince's catalog (with the exception of Chaos &amp; Disorder, which rocks) has left me cold.  People call him a genius but I rarely hear evidence of that - it all sounds pretty bleh to me.  But this album has me second-guessing myself!  Have I misjudged him all along?  Or has he just made an album I can get into?  It's jazzy, soulful, spiritual...but the thing that grabs me most is that it sounds so REAL.  As though it was made by humans with lives and emotions who live and breathe, not by machines.  Most of his material sounds so plastic to me, this is a breath of fresh air.  And an adventurous one, too.  It reminds me of Sting's &quot;Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot; in that way, if not necessarily musically, then at least in its approach and its departure.  If someone asked me for comparisons to other artists, I might say to throw Donald Fagen, Arrested Development, James Brown, and Todd Rundgren into a blender and...well, it might not sound a lot like this, but that's about as close as I'm likely to get.<br />If I have a criticism of the album, it's that I could do without the narration.  It comes off like Zappa's Central Scrutinizer meets Rush's Necromancer, and at times it goes on way too long.  I suppose it's one way of conveying the story, but I could live without it.  The more I listen to the album, though, the less I seem to mind it.<br />Some have criticized this album as reheated fusion, or reheated gospel soul, or reheated whatever.  Well, it may be that, but it's better than the reheated disco he usually cranks out.  This is an album for people, not for drones.  If you're looking for a mindless excursion into booty-shaking, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a cohesive album with a real message and real melodies AND the frequently danceable groove, this is the album for you.  It's the Prince album for people who don't like Prince.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I have seen a number of movies that made me cry - yeah I am weeper and don't apologize for it.  I enjoy great movies and this one is tops.  I rented it simply because I remembered the actor's antics while accepting the Academy Award years ago.  I thought it was a comedy.  It is and it isn't.  Anymore would say too much.  I rented it months ago on DVD at Blockbuster, so I have no idea why Amazon says it is being released in January 2002.  I want to buy it for myself for Christmas and watch it with my kids when they are old enough.  DVD has English audio with no sub-titles which makes it much easier to concentrate on the story.  Being new to DVD's, I wish I had found that option earlier in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon...  Live and learn - especially after being touched by this story.  This should be mandatory viewing for everyone...
0316920045|5.0|David Foster Wallace is a genius, and he knows it.  But unlike other geniuses that you might know, he never tries to make you feel dumb.  He just wants you to understand the same things that he does, so occasionally you'll feel out of your depth.  But he's also a gifted writer, so odds are that you *will* come out understanding him.  And what he's saying is brilliant, so you'll feel like a better person for it.<br />Wallace has been described as ``postmodern\\", a word that seems to get smacked onto anything written after World War II.  I don't see it.  To me, postmodernism involves a few things: 1) irony, in liberal doses (e.g., DeLillo's _White Noise_); 2) a continuous awareness that we're *reading a book* and that there's an author talking to us, and that the characters are under his control (e.g., anything by Kurt Vonnegut); 3) self-reference, sometimes to the point of disorienting involution (e.g., Wallace's story ``Westward The Course Of Empire Makes Its Way\\" from his book _Girl With Curious Hair_ - and that story is, notably, a spoof of postmodernism).  This may be an overly conservative definition of postmodernism, but the word's overapplication justifies some conservatism.<br />_Infinite Jest_ is not postmodern; it's just a great story with beautifully constructed characters.  It is a book about a movie that is so addictive that anyone who starts watching it has no choice but to keep watching it forever - foregoing food, water, and sleep, and suffering as much pain as is necessary to keep watching.  The movie itself is, to paraphrase a friend, an uber-McGuffin (I'm never sure whether I've spelled that right) - an object that never gets clearly explained, but around which the plot coheres.<br />The movie itself is not the main point of the book.  _Infinite Jest_ is a novel about American addictions: television, drugs, sex, fame, and indeed the American need to be addicted to something.  An addiction to addictions.  Wallace summarizes the book's mood well when he says,<br />``There's something particularly sad about it, something that doesn't have very much to do with physical circumstances, or the economy, or any of the stuff that gets talked about in the news. It's more like a stomach-level sadness. I see it in myself and my friends in different ways. It manifests itself as a kind of lostness. Whether it's unique to our generation I really don't know.\\"<br />(...)<br />The main sign of Wallace's genius - and yes, I mean that word with all it entails, content in the knowledge that it is overused but that it fits here - is that he can make us feel this gut-level sadness without even appearing to work at it.  Heavy use of irony can make you feel that there's some deeper, unseen, lurking gloominess about the world, and for that reason it's the easy way out.  Ditto self-reference, which after a while is dizzying and confusing.  Wallace is too brilliant a writer to take any of the easy postmodern routes.  He's just written a great story with an unpleasant underlying mood.  It's been a long time since I've read a book of such masterful subtlety.<br />It has all the classic aspects of a great novel: characters whom the reader *understands*, a compelling story that edges inexorably toward an uncertain ending, a gut-level mood, and a habit of dispensing brilliant toss-offs so suddenly that the reader can't help but gasp.  For instance, see the attached text file containing Wallace's future-retrospective explanation of why videophones failed.<br />My first inclination was that this book - weighing in at over a thousand pages, including hundreds of footnotes (some of which have their own footnotes) - needed an editor.  And it may, at points.  But there's very little chaff amongst the wheat: the book's heft serves at least three purposes:<br />1) To build characters, slowly and methodically.  One of Wallace's flaws is that his characters' dialogue - particularly that of his youthful protagonist and tennis prodigy, Hal Incandenza - doesn't sound genuine.  It sounds like Wallace talking through 17-year-olds, not 17-year-olds who've been transcribed.  I think Wallace realizes this, which is why most of his character development comes through narration.<br />2) To dump out the contents of Wallace's swirling brain.  He has so much to say, and he seems to want to get it all down on paper in this one book.  Less profound thoughts from a less talented author might have left me screaming for an editor, but they didn't do so here.<br />3) To structure the book as a conversation.  Reading this book, one feels as though one is talking directly with Wallace.  More often than not, his sentences will contain heavy Latinate words like ``epicanthic\\" just a short distance from the conversational stammerings ``like\\" and ``and so but\\".  Again, had a lesser writer written these words, I would have edited the book myself, filling the margins with red pen.<br />The book's length will discourage all but a few readers, but it handsomely rewards the patient.esn't sound genuine.

0783235607|5.0|Little can be added to the hundreds of reviews that tell you how good Leigh and Perkins are in their roles, how their innocent facades belie their hidden feelings of guilt, how Hitchock wisely shies away from showing us too much, and lets our imaginations frighten us instead, so instead I will concentrate on a couple of amusing continuity errors I haven't seen anyone mention before. Firstly in the shower scene (filmed over several days) Leigh's hair changes from shot to shot. Second, in the scene in the Sherriff's house, the Sheriff's wife acts 'understanding' by tipping her head to one side. This would be fine, but every time there is a cut (and there are many) her head is at a different angle!<br />These are of course tiny niggles and the film is deservedly known as a masterpiece.<br />Just one more thing. If you listen to the music in I Know What You Did Last Summer, made as recently as 1997, you can tell how enduring and powerful an influence Bernard Hermann's score for Psycho is, as certain parts are near-identical.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt in my mind that this is an enjoyable CD.  It definately rocks and Gwen does not disappoint.  Being a fairly new Gwen fan<BR>after seeing her with Moby, she genuinely entertains with her lyrics and beat.  Hey Baby stands out, but I actually liked all the tracks on this CD.  Hella Good is just that, and I was pleasantly suprised by Rock Steady and In My Head.  I truly think that if you are a Stefani fan, you will not be disappointed.
6305075492|5.0|A madman's fantasy, 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' is a still-unsettling mixture of the archaic and the avant-garde.  The celebrated sets, all grotesquely distorted, perspectively impossible, architecturally collapsed buildings and streets, strange angles and enigmatic geometric motifs, are like a demented revision of those medieval Central European villages that are usually the settings for these kind of stories; but they also echo (in monochrome) the folk-modernist paintings of Chagall, particularly those depicting Jewish shtetls with fantastic and dream imagery.  <br />The mood and atmosphere, the world of carnies and somnambulists, of Town Clerks, bell-ringers and lunatic asylums, even of nocturnal serial killers, all suggest periods of time from the late-19th century backwards; but the oneiric filming of Cesare's unmotivated night wandering, his zombie face blanching a tight black bodystocking, is reminiscent of Feuillade's crime serials (such as 'Les Vampires'); also anticipating Surrealism is the strangely seeping texture of the imagery, with fragments of bodies on the brink of dematerialising.  <br />The film is heavily influenced by Freud (from the homosexuality implicit in the central love triangle to the introduction of a phallic sleepwalker in a box by Caligari to Jane to the inability of Cesare to murder a virgin), but another 20th century giant is arguably more important: Kafka (one of the Prague-born screenwriters wrote for Kafka's friend, Max Brod).  From the comedy of bureaucracy (the aggressively officious Town Clerk; the gormless police) to the location of chaos, madness and murder in the ravings of paternal/patriarchal authority, the film's movement is one of remorseless anxiety - 'Caligari''s look is flooded with the dread paranoia of its narrator.  <br />Even the mix of ancient documents and mystery plot is modern, looking forward to the stories of Borges.<br />It is easy to mock 'Caligari' in retrospect - the cop-out of the framing narrative (which I humbly think only deepens the film's themes, and produces an amazing asylum tableau); the reliance on theatrical (sets, acting) rather than cinematic expression; the absurd hamming of the actors (a truly haunted Conrad Veidt excepted).  But 'Caligari' has a lingering evocative power, a profound and phantasmagoric imagery that unfailingly penetrates those deepest and least admissable desires and fears supposedly 'better' films can't access.  No wonder critics for nearly a century have attributed all sorts of nonsense to it.<br />(Be warned: like 'Metropolis', the success of 'Caligari' depends on the quality of the score (the Redemption print I saw had a horrible Hollywood-horror, sub-Wagnerian over-emphasis) and the right speed (mine was played too fast, and was over in less than 50 minutes, making the story look like a daft pantomime)
B00003CXXS|5.0|IMO this is way far better then both Jurassic Park 1 &amp; 2. The story line is great and theres a make sense plot. Also did I mention the action is all there. You gotta add this one to your DVD collection. I am glad I go this one!!!
B00005N9CV|2.0|I bought this CD based on an article by Stephen Holden in the 12/6/01 New York Times. The article was about the current state of cabaret singing. Holden said the album was &quot;perhaps the most satisfying collection of orchestrated popular standards to be released since the heyday of Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald.&quot; I hope not, given how bad the album is. Before buying this album, buy some of the Sinatra albums with Riddle from the early 1950s and some of Fitzgerald's Songbook albums, if you haven't already.<br />This is my first album by Krall. Her style/approach, at least on this album, did nothing for me. It was interesting to see that quite a few of the online reviewers hated this album, but liked her earlier albums. Yet, I found one online reviewer that thought this album was her best and that her other albums were bad.
B00000J7JO|3.0|First let me say this IS a really good album. However, I think of the peppers like I think of U2 or Madonna, in an 80's vs 90's sort of way. I love all three 90's albums. BUT, compared to their earlier stuff like &quot;Freaky Styley&quot; or &quot;Mothers Milk&quot; they dont quite rock as much. You see, there's a reason why the Chili Peppers are Red Hot, and its because of what they did in the mid-eighties. Anyone new to the band who really wants to get funked up, I highly urge you to get or listen to their third album &quot;The uplift mofo party plan&quot;. It is Anthony at his rappenest, and the band at their rockinest. Plus you get a &quot;Special secret song&quot; inside.
B00005OMTT|2.0|If like me you only have the 'Le roi est mort, vive le roi!' album and you like what you heard- don't buy this and expect similar tracks.<br /> With the exception of the amazing track 11 and the okay track 3, the only other good tracks come from the 'Le roi est mort' album. On the other hand if you like their other album's then this might be to your liking. Personally i think its a waste of money. <br /> Lucky, i was going to spend even more on getting the 'Trilogy' album. Instead check out 'Delerium', there latest 2 efforts have been very good and they appeal to Enigma fans.

B00003CXRP|4.0|I would have given this film five stars except for the overdone, overwrought, hyperactive and unconvincing Russian sequence near the beginning.  Brother Hanks' character comes across there as a caricature of time-obssessed executivedom.  Maybe that was the intent, but it struck me as more distracting than persuasive.<br />But then the movie moves up to near perfection, which means that it grabbed and enfolded me, much like a good book one can't put down, which is after all what I MOST want from a book or movie.  Excellent job by Hanks &amp; Company, amply pointed out by other reviewers, but I want highly to praise one aspect:  the minimalist score.  For much of this movie, music is absent.  Welcomely absent!  Replaced by natural wind, sea and nature sounds.  The effect adds to the languid passage of time felt by maroonee Hanks.  A very good choice, to can the music.  And where there is music, it is quiet and appropriate, a most welcome antithesis to John Williamsesque blare and bombast.   <br />All in all an excellent job, and I don't think I'm an easy reviewer.   I see purchase of this DVD in my future.

B00005QDW1|4.0|Exposed navels, bleached blondes, three guys and a cheeky charismatic lead singer are usually the images that come to mind when describing the Southern California quartet No Doubt. Now with that, add a seasoning of Caribbean style rhythms and catchy hooks to get the band's latest offering, Rock Steady. The foursome's fifth studio longplayer is a collection of delectable island-splashed pop with dance club appeal. <br />Always the explorationists, the group takes a new creative step in their sound and music. Released only a year after their 2000 smash Return To Saturn, the boys and girl of No Doubt fall into no particular formulaic pattern. Rather than boring their listeners by treading the same musical ground of past hit albums, the band expands and further defines its own unique brand of So Cal ska. <br />Innovating instead of reduplicating, Rock Steady takes chances and experiments with new soundscapes. The album takes its cue from dancehall-reggae, hip hop and new wave, never juxtaposing but intermixing - exploring their influences in the genres like never before. <br />Songs indicative of this newfound exploration include the lead single, \\"Hey Baby,\\" the dance numbers \\"Hella Good\\" and \\"Start The Fire\\" and the retro-pop of \\"Underneath It All,\\" which harks back to the second wave ska of The Specials. <BR>Working with a mix of producers ranging from hip-hop virtuosos the Neptunes (Mystikal, Kelis), Nelle Hooper (U2, Björk), reggae duo Sly &amp; Robbie and former Cars frontman Ric Ocasek, who provides the songs \\"Making Out\\" and \\"In My Head,\\" the album is musically eclectic while managing to stay conceptually cohesive. <br />Vocally, it's still Gwen's show, but the album offers one noteworthy guest appearance. The artist once again known as Prince, a long time No Doubt collaborator who offered his services for the group's last LP and various B-sides, reappears with \\"Waiting Room,\\" a tribal, funk-laced duet. On a majority of the songs, Stefani's vocals are strong andassured accentuating nicely with her band's sound. <br />Lyrically, the songwriting is less confessional and regret-oriented due in large part to No Doubt's decision to include new writers. You won't find a syrupy ballad in the vein of \\"Don't Speak\\" or \\"Simple Kind Of Life\\" here; the vibe of Rock Steady is contextually mid-tempo with emphasis on bass speaker approval - dealing with everything from raucous fans to the typical Stefani templates of longing love and bedazzlement. All night parties and good times seem to be the principal theme of the group's dancehall tinged melodies and upbeat subject matter. <br />Rock Steady, after all, is a celebration of No Doubt's influences and appreciations combined with a forward-thinking inimitability. Though inventive, their native So Cal punk origins are still visible. While other members of the ska-punk community opt for re-creation, No Doubt continually pushes the supposed limitations of the genre and gerrymanders its boundaries.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Anyone giving this film less than 5 stars is demonstrating their ignorance.  This masterpiece should be watched carefully by anyone who thinks they &quot;know&quot; movies.  The reality, much too often, is that people only see the latest postmodernism films that pale in comparison to this work.  One may not enjoy this movie, but one cannot deny it is a masterpiece.  Personal taste and criticism are very different things.
B000002LQR|5.0|Well first off let me just say, this album is just brilliant. In a world where rock is doomed to cliches, one hot wonders, and backstreet boy-eque teen popularity, it is sooo nice to listen to an album like this.<BR>This album, (my favorite chilli peppers album) is loaded with not only rock, but alot of funk, blues influence, and is brilliantly concieved to the last track. Flea, unquestionably the most brilliant of todays mainstream bass players, lays down a slap free enviroment, and displays some oldskool two finger technique that blows away anything that Victor Wooten or other flash players can do, just because of his sheer soul on the instrument. John Frusciante (spelled wrong, sorry) Is also one of the most brilliant and talented guitarists in todays rock and throughout plays beautifuly through the ballads as well as the funk jams. And talk about a drummer, Chad Smith lays down some great beats and shines on Breaking The Girl. And last but certainly not least, is Anthony, who is just great, noone else sounds like him, great lyrics, great singing, ALOT of soul. (...) <br />Overall this album ranks for one of top in the 90s, it hasnt lost anythign since its relase. [Forget] terrible corperate rock bands like linkin park and limp bizkit and get on the funk train with Red Hot Chilli Peppers!
B00003CXDD|5.0|If you want action, adventure, scorcery, and drama than let this be your movie. George Lucas (Star Wars,American Graffiti)<BR>teams up with Ron Howard (Opie on Andy Grifith) to bring this magical movie to life. Mad Mardigan(Val Kilmer) teams up with <BR>Willow(Warwick Davis) to protect a baby from an evil Sorceress. <BR>It is the babies prophecy to destroy the sorceress, so the Sorceress will stop at nothing to stop the prophecy.
061318114X|5.0|Diamond binds the story of mankind that we read in the fossil record to biological and ecological problems of today, and in between provides insight into how and why culture developed as it did. A book for everyone interested in the forces that shape our society.
B000002KAT|5.0|I first bought this record album when it was originally released way back in the mists of history (1968 in fact) when I was a Beatlemaniac! It changed my musical life. I next bought the cassette so that I could take the music with me wherever I went. I now have it in CD form and STILL listen to it while driving in my car. I have been listening to it for 32 years and have never once got tired of it. How many albums can you say that about? When you first listen to it, the music is not completely accessible, because the words are mysterious and the music deep and complex.  However, keep listening because the layers of the music, the sounds, the feelings, the poetry all develop over time until you are totally wrapped up in them. If you like intricate base guitar playing or soulful saxaphone you'll love this CD. You must listen to this album all the way through as each track is a devlopment on the last.  Take it only on LONG drives. I have been searching ever since for an album of comparable quality and interest, by Van Morrisson or others. The only one that comes even a little bit close is &quot;White Ladder&quot; by David Gray, but it is still nothing like Astral Weeks.
B00004RF98|4.0|You don't have to look far to find movie experts who say &quot;Singin'&quot; is perhaps the greatest movie musical, and I won't dispute that.  I have two significant beefs with the movie, and they both involve Gene Kelly.<br />In the &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; segment a ten minute, lavish, overdone musical number is inserted directly into the heart of a movie which is clipping along just fine WITHOUT this totally unrelated number.  It's a fine song and dance number - it just has NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie.<br />The other beef is with Kelly's &quot;acting&quot;.  There are the scenes where he is SUPPOSED to be &quot;overacting&quot; as the great Lockwood - but in the OTHER scenes, the &quot;back in real life&quot; ones - his &quot;acting&quot; is almost exactly the same.  You could argue this character is SUPPOSED to be this way, but I say nay, Lockwood is supposed to be the sympathetic half of Lockwood and Lamont, and you should WANT him to be a more &quot;regular guy&quot; so that you can better believe that Debbie Reynolds would fall for him.<br />The REMAINDER of the movie is so utterly perfect that this is quibbling. Donald O'Connor steals all of his scenes, and &quot;Make 'em Laugh&quot; steals the whole show!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Hollywood just doesn't make films like this really.  I mean, I doubt many in that town have the artistic ability to pull it off.  But the Coen brothers shall set thee free if you let them.  With a tightly written script and magnificent use of color in every scene, &quot;O Brother&quot; takes us to a place so unique yet familiar.  The DVD is very well assembled, with some good behind-the-scenes stuff, including a facinating documentary called &quot;Painting with Pixels&quot; which details the exclusive use of computer color processing for the entire film(quite a challange).  The 5.1 Dolby soundtrack creates a masterful sound field which adds so much to the experience.  There is also a DTS for anyone who can decode it.  This movie is somewhat quirky, so be careful whom you spring this DVD on.  If the person is a fan of Coen brother movies, you can't go wrong with &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; on DVD.
6305537550|5.0|&quot;Halloween&quot; is just a thrilling and freaky movie. John Carpenter's music chills me to this day. His direction is dark and claustrophobic, moving along with the characters instead of cutting to the next shot. This movie also set the standard for all other slasher films that followed. However, &quot;Halloween&quot; is not a gruesome teen slasher flick. Almost NO blood or gore is shown on-screen, which is a plus. The film builds on suspense and atmosphere, which is important for a horror film. Jamie Lee Curtis is at her best here as the babysitter Laurie Strode. The last half of the movie is where the real terror begins, as Laurie runs away from Michael Myers. When you hear Carpenter's music play, your heart just pumps rapidly and you never feel safe. To me, this is the epitome of a scary movie. Even after 20 years of numerous sequels and imitators, &quot;Halloween&quot; remains the scariest of all horror films.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt finally hit big 6+ years ago with &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, then it took them almost 5 years to release &quot;Return To Saturn&quot; which did not strike chords with the American public or me.<br />With songs one by one faltering at radio &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;Simple Kind of Love&quot; and &quot;Bathwater&quot;, Gwen Stefano went her separate ways with the band to do duets with Eve and Moby- which put Gwen Stefano in a different light with MTV and teen audiences, and both those songs became Eve and Mobys biggest hits.<br />The band once again went into the studio and just a year after &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; was released and came out with their best album EVER!.<br />&quot;Rock Steady&quot; is a funky, rappy, new wave, R&amp;B, rock delight.<BR>With the first single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; already on the Billboard Top 40 and getting high rotation video play on MTV with great response their label decided to release the album one week earlier.<br />No Doubt show on &quot;Rock Steady&quot; an absolute talent with fun and danceable music with the catchy lyrics of &quot;Hey Baby&quot; to &quot;Hella Good&quot;, and &quot;Making Out&quot;.<br />The band also shows a new look with the three male band members taking a complete overhaul in the makeover department, and Gwen as a more funky get down kinda girl.<br />The band shows a funner side with great pop music. All of the songs on this CD are very strong and could all be singles.<br />&quot;Rock Steady&quot; has grammy written all over it and shows a lighter and more upbeat side to the serious &quot;Return To Saturn&quot;.  Though &quot;Return to Saturn&quot; was a okay album &quot;Rock Steady&quot; brings No Doubt to the top reigns of the pop market.
B000002JK4|5.0|This is simply one of the best rock albums of the early 80's, a clever blending of musical styles of the day.  Phil Collins is on board for most of the tracks, kicking (...) just before he went the path of lameness where he resides today.  With Collins' beautifully intricate beats, Robbie Blunt's ethereal guitar and compositions full of light and just enough keyboards, Plant delivers the finest solo offering of his career to date.  \\"Thru With The Twostep\\" is worth the price of the disc alone.  \\"Big Log\\" expresses something that is inexpressible in words.<br />No, this isn't Zeppelin, but it's a small piece of them.
B00003CX6P|3.0|This i s  over-the-top and on the stupid side. The plot and the gaytheme never reach catharisis; it`s only helped by the Italian landscape and the ever impressive Jude Law...
B00005UKE0|5.0|I first bought this album in 1970 and loved it. I don't recall anyone by the name of Phil Collins among the credited musicians. At the time of recording, Phil was an obscure drummer in an obscure band called Flaming Youth and hadn't yet joined another obscure band called Genesis (with whom I had yet to make my acquaintance). Another soon-to-be-famous drummer on ATMP was Alan White, later of Yes, who had been doing session work for John Lennon and Joe Cocker.
0385505833|2.0|I fell asleep in the express line on page 11.  Needless to say, I passed on buying it.
0783225482|5.0|I can't believe this movie didn't get more attention! This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep and Bruce Willis, they were all hilarious. I never knew Bruce could be so funny!
B00003CXXI|5.0|This movie is very cute. It includes humor for adults so it is just as enjoyable to watch for adults as it is for kids. Its graphics are amazing it is so real. I love it and am definitely going to buy it for my collection of DVDS and vidoes.
0784010188|5.0|First off, T2 probably ranks as my favorite movie of all time. There's something about it that holds my attention viewing after viewing.<br />DVD arrived just in time! My video tape of T2 had worn so thin, you could probably read through it, so when my wife and I purchased our DVD player, this film was a must-buy.<br />The DVD version of course, offers a whole lot more than the video ever did. In addition to the &quot;bonus&quot; stuff, such as interviews and trailers, there are the scenes which were cut from the theatrical release.<br />If T2 is among your favorites, by all means... GET THE DVD!
B00005QCYC|2.0|Wait for them to put out a trilogy with ALL movies in DTS.  You REALLY want DTS for THESE movies.
0446310786|5.0|Books I consider exemplary have a few qualities: straightforward but engaging narration, likable characters, and a plot which examines &quot;issues&quot; without becoming strained in doing so. To Kill a Mockingbird possesses each of these qualities. What makes it especially outstanding is the point of view and what is left unsaid. One main driver of the plot is an incident which we never witness and only learn of through some testimony. One of the main characters in relation to the plot we spend a scant few pages with--we never really know him in order to sympathize with him as a character. And another main character, Atticus, though extraordinarily quiet, maintains a powerful presence reminiscent of Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead.<br />The simplicity and one-sided nature of the trial can be considered a shortcoming, but they actually make the novel's point that much more powerful. It's believable that the jury would find Tom guilty despite his obvious innocence, and this emphasizes how much man can be cruelly unfair to his neighbor. The ending does seem a bit strained as Atticus somehow is unable to see who killed whom when his children were attacked, but this is a very minor flaw.<br />Overall To Kill a Mockingbird tells a powerful, emotional tale with the easy childhood innocence of its narrator. It makes the reader feel tremendously guilty, seeing what we as a society could be vs. what we unfortunately are. If we interpret this not as an accusation by Lee but rather as an inspiration then maybe we can improve things a bit.
B00005QDW1|4.0|So the ska thing was put to rest for awhile so Gwen could write some deeper songs for &quot;Saturn&quot; and now the band has decided now is the time to just crank up the volume and have FUN!  That's exactly what they did...ROCK STEADY is a cd that is nothing but fun that just makes you want to sing at the top of your lungs and dance.  From first single HEY BABY to the rocker PLATINUM BLONDE LIFE this cd is solid No Doubt, giving a taste of the true mood of this party band.  Only one or two tracks failed to inspire a good mood from me, even though they tried pretty hard.  We love them when they're doing simple things like MARRY ME (From &quot;Saturn&quot;) but this is what it's all about...everyone just relax and have some fun!
0385505833|5.0|I so enjoyed reading this one and I am not an avid fan of John Grisham. This was funny and I couldn't wait to get back home,from my Christmas shopping sprees, to pick it back up again. I didn't want it to come to an end. I dare anyone to read this and not be just a little bit tempted to do the same thing that Luther wanted to do. I'm still considering it myself  for next year. Don't hesitate to buy this one and get an extra one to give as a present. It's good  for many laughs and the story wraps  up well. Just a little Christmas humor there.<br /> Grisham may want to consider writing comedy for a while. I read somewhere that odds are this one will be a made-for-televison movie by next year. Merry Christmas readers!!
B00003CXXR|2.0|This joins the long list of sequels that don't only not measure up to the original but don't measure up full stop.  It even manages to be worst than 'The Lost World', which a feat in itself.  I'm unsure whether the corny story was intentional.  If it is then it's a terrible idea.  There's absolutely no suspense, mumbled pseudo-science pushed onto us - more about intelligent raptors - and from the start you can tell exactly which characters will survive.  All this and a stunningly abrupt ending that even makes we wish for the T-rex rampaging San Deigo.<br />There are two good things going for this movie: the acting and the special effects.  With regards to the dinosaurs, impressive as they are we have seen them before.  They were ground-breaking in 'Jurassic Park' but here the director seems to have relied to heavily on imposing images which aren't quite as imposing as I imagine he hoped.  The acting meanwhile is another matter.  There's William H Macy (of 'Magnolia' and 'ER'), Tea Leoni ('Deep Impact', though probably more famous as David Duchovany's wife) and the team have wisely brought back Sam Neill.  The real star though is Laura Dern, who returns for a few scenes near the start and the end.  Unfortunately her scenes appear so brief it makes you wonder why she returned at all.<br />This is a film that will entertain kids, but certainly not adults.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The soundtrack to the ghastly audacious visual feast of a film by Baz Luhrmann in every way surpassed my expectations. With a wide range of music from the latino beat of 05) Rhythm of the Night, to classic rock 07) Children of the Revolution, to modern day frenzy 03) Because We can, to French serenade 04) Complainte de la Butte, to Indian medley 05) Hindi Sad Diamonds, this CD is a fabulous anthology of the different facets which made Moulin Rouge the musical such a gem. And another thing, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are themselves great singers, and their versility as performers penetrate through every single track featuring their vocal prowess. Kidman's calm, mature, but at the same time exuberant voice blends perfectly with McGregor's boyish, charming, saturated tone. And listening to the tracks truly take you back to the dazzling scenes of the film because the CD does such a good job collecting the condiments of the Moulin Rouge: from decadence to innocence, from perdition to salvation, from audacity to chagrin... Wow, I can't stop playing it. Really.
B000021Y74|5.0|This film from German director Twyker is a real treat.  In it we follow Lola try to raise 100,000 marks for her boyfriend Manni to pay back some gangsters, the only catch being that she has to do this in only twenty minutes!  And so the audience is treated to three different ways in which Lola gets the money.<br />This film has several things going for it - a pulse-pounding techno soundtrack (with Franka Potente who plays Lola on vocals), stunning visuals and a fast story that you really get caught up in.  All of this makes for a very flashy movie that will completely draw you in.  However, what gives it that extra twist is the way in which the movie shows that the slightest thing can set the course of our future, demonstrated by snapshots of people that Lola meets in her travels through their lives.  Plus there's some extraordinary acting from the two main characters that makes you really care for their plight.<br />What's also different is the fact that the movie manages to be sad, funny and gripping.  And film that can achieve that has to be recognised.  There are also some highly interesting scenes in between each story in which the young couple discuss love, the future and other such topics.  It's little wonder that this was so highly acclaimed, and is likely to become a cult classic in years to come.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|With a talking mule as one of the main characters, be prepared for a lot of wordplay with the word &quot;ass&quot;. Adults might want to view the movie before deciding whether they want younger viewers exposed to Shrek.
0385505833|4.0|This is a light but enjoyable book. It isn't a proper thriller like his other books (if you're hungry for a thriller, get Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE) but this is enjoyable and seasonal.
0767821629|4.0|Ask a philsophical question like &quot;what is real?&quot; and you might be supprised at the answers that you get back.  Craig Bierko and Gretchen Mol star in this drama about a company that creates a simulated world, only to find out that they are also simulated themselves.
B00005QDW1|4.0|You gotta give em kudos for experimentation, those crazy Anaheim kids called No Doubt, who have gone from only local popularity as a goofy punk/ska band to commercial success as a goofy punk/ska/techno/alternative/new wave/score a hit by collaborating with these people band. Their 2000 album Return Of Saturn was a listenable comeback, although much of it seemed so forced and unfocused compared to 1995's Tragic Kingdom. But times have changed too, and No Doubt is obviously bored of the sound critics and fans want them to duplicate. No Doubt is also a fun, playful band and Rock Steady, their new album portrays them just like that. Return seemed like work, Rock seems like play. The album is filled with a few of the band's signatures: catchy, ear candy reggae, pop, and touches of ska and punk. The other ingredients are the William Orbit, Nellee Hooper techno bleeps. Rock may scare off the rest of No Doubt's fans who still exist after Return Of Saturn's experimental styles, but they cant deny alot of the tunes are as bootylicious as Destiny's Child and Madonna with the punky/new wave mentality of Blondie or The Cars (and Ric does produce on here). Who couldnt love &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, Gwen's take on the problem with groupies. &quot;Making Out&quot;-like whoa! Its Beacon Street all over again! Other standouts include &quot;Underneath It All&quot; and &quot;Detective&quot;. Rock Steady is little more in No Doubt's ball park than Return, although both albums scream We are out of the tragic kingdom! We Still Rock!!!!  No Doubt dares to dream and play, and that is Rock Steady.
B00005QIPH|4.0|good lord. being a huge VU fan i was a little nervous after hearing all the talk that they were ripping off the VU and television (as if television was that great of a band.. oops). this is a fine album with some clever lyrics and catchy music. i can kind of see where the VU comparisons are coming from, but it's not a huge thing.<br />whatever. they are apparently rich kids with good connections, and i probably wouldn't like them personally, but who cares. their album is pretty good, especially compared to some of the other [music] being released this year.
B00005LB50|5.0|It's difficult to imagine any fan of this legendary band being disappointed by this long-awaited collection.  As a Springfield admirer from way back (i.e. when they were still together), I can testify that this box contains far more previously unreleased treasures than were rumored to exist over the years.  And as for there being no live recordings, both Stills and Young have said that no decent tapes exist.  Judging by the various bootlegs I've heard--which feature no performances better than what was captured in the studio--they're apparently right about that.  Several of the unreleased tracks were eventually reborn on albums by Young, Stills and Poco, and I'm glad none of them were left out to make room for the overrated extended version of &quot;Bluebird&quot; that was briefly available around 1973.  All in all, this box represents a motherlode of great stuff from an era When the Music Mattered.
067144901X|5.0|This was one of our very favorite books when my first child was a toddler.  In fact, it's the first book she ever memorized.  I remember standing in line at the grocery and distracting her by whispering the words of this book back and forth between us.  Now that she's older, this is an easy book for her to learn to read and she reads it to her baby sister.  This would be a great book to slip into a congratulatory bouquet or basket to give to new parents!
B00003CXXS|3.0|Well, JP3 is a decent flick. First time I saw it I was completely blown away. The second time however it wasn't that great. Still the action sequences are amazing. ILM really outdid themselves on the dino effects. But the comic relief starts to wear thin already the second time round, and well, the story isn't that great. It works though, just don't pay too much time to details. Sam Neill is good, as is Bill Macy (as always, one of my favorite actors). So, the best thing to do is rent this, and decide for yourself whether to buy this or not. I don't know about the DVD extras, guess you'll need to find that out for yourself. <BR>All in all JP3 is a fun movie, but don't expect mindboggling plots or something.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Well, it certainly is a bit different, but different is not always better.  This is probably their most Pop-like outing.<br />With more &quot;dance music&quot; friendly songs than the ska music they used to do aside from their melodic ballads.  As for the intro to some of the songs like &quot;Running&quot;, &quot;Platinum Blonde&quot;,  and &quot;Rock Steady&quot; the synthesized, rather than authentic guitars, sounds like video game music sampled straight from Super Mario Bros which really annoyed me on &quot;Running&quot; because this song could've been an amazing track.  It worked for &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, though.  <br />Overall, the album works out well, but nothing spectacular.  Best tracks on this album are &quot;Hella good&quot; and &quot;Rock Steady&quot;
B000002NJS|5.0|i was never an avid madonna fan before. sure, i love a lot of her songs, but i only had 2 of her previous albums, bedtime stories and something to remember (which is actually a collection of her ballads)... not surprising since she started making albums when i was really little. i'd rather buy, say, a collection of her singles, rather than buying all of her back catalogs. &quot;ray of light&quot;, however changed all that. i simply love it and i can never say enough how brilliant it is.<br />   madonna doesn't actually have powerhouse vocals, but i admire her for knowing her limits and working within it. however, over the years, i have to say her singing had improved a lot, compared to her previous efforts. don't let her controversial reputation fool you. even her latest album, music, comes nowhere near the ingenuity and emotion of this record. a lot of ppl think that motherhood made a big impact in her outlook and i agree. i think for this album she spent a lot of time contemplating her life and feelings and how it changed the moment she has a baby who totally depends on her like no one does. the result is simply amazing.<br />  my absolute-st favourite track has to be 'frozen'... man, it gives me the chill and gives the phrase &quot;love ballad&quot; a whole different meaning. although i must admit that 'the power of goodbye' and 'nothing really matters' are not far behind. and i think drowned world is an amazing track, too.<br />  when i first heard the album, i thought this is  hard to top, and judging from &quot;music&quot;, it proved to be true, at least for now. however, never underestimate her. she might just prove me wrong.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Ok, so she had to learn English in order to do this album.  Big f***ing deal.  I've been a big fan of hers since _Pies Descalzos_ came out and no American (read: Anglo) listener even knew how to pronounce her name.  Her lyrics are just as puzzling and tongue-in-cheeck as in _Donde Estan Los Ladrones_, which put her in the stratosphere and made the English market take notice (although it was slow at first).<br />I love the pop, rock, disco, and spanish that she throws into this album.  Honestly, I didn't set my expectations too high because I knew that this would be her first English album (or did you already forget?) and because I knew that she was still learning to speak English.  And honestly...English is a hard language to learn for a non-native speaker.<br />Regardless of her linguistic capabilities, Shakira managed to pleasently surprise me with her wit and her ability to write songs that say what I wish I could scream out loud.  For this, I will always remain her fan and applaud any project she takes on.  Because I know it will be worth it.
B00005QDW1|2.0|My title says it all.  Listening to Rock Steady is like being forced to sit through looped Britney Spears, C. Aguilerra like beats.  Songs are composed of one stanza repeated throughout the song???  What happened?<br />I don't have anything good to say about this one...
6305926794|5.0|this is the most amazing and comprehensive dvd and concert that i have ever seen. the harmony between the symphony and metalica is perfectly balanced and only enhances the great legendary sound that is metallica.  i have listened to the cd countless times, and viewed the dvd in parts so many times i think the dvd might melt.  for anyone that has heard this music or is a fervent metallica fan who has not seen this dvd for some reason, i give my highest regard to this masterpiece andi strongly encourage the purchase and viewing of this masterfully orchestrated performance.
0465068359|4.0|This book is a must for all servicemen who serve in Asia.  It will help to explain how 400,000 Women, children, elderly, and prisoners of war were raped and slaughtered in a month and a half.  The author does not just blame the Japanese for their actions, but she tries to describe the Japanese mindset that could have caused these atrocities.  The book is very well researched and a pretty easy, although gruesome, read.  The last third of the book is excellent and ties up history from the end of WWII until the present.  It describes the geopolitical tensions in this region and why the Japanese text books cause a major point of contention in this theater.  Those who don't study history are bound to repeat it.  I nominated this book for entry into the Marine Corps Reading List for what it has to offer.
0811826848|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan since they first came to America.  From Ed Sullivan to their last gig on the Apple Records rooftop this book has it all.  Great photos and cover artwork as well.  <br />Also recommended for Beatles fans:  THE CARPET FROGS: MUSIC AFTER TOMORROW by Alan Arlt
6304082428|5.0|What is most lovely about this adaptation of Pride and and Prejudice is how true the screenplay remains to the novel. Indeed, Andrew Davies could not have done a better job of following the narrative of Austen's beloved novel. The characters, the plot, and the composition so closely parallel the novel that one can hardly tell the difference between the book and the film. Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth burn up the screen. One wishes that more than arch looks and longing glances could pass between the two. This reviewer can most honestly say that of all the films based on Jane Austen's novels this is by far the best. I, myself, watch it every opportunity I get. Be prepared to watch the movie in its entirety because once you start, you will not be able to stop.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Yes, there is some resemblance to the Velvet Underground, especially in certain inflections by singer Julian Casablancas.  By the way, what's with running his voice through a bench-grinder for the entire length of the CD?  The vocals get a bit annoying over the long haul, kind of like the engineering on the Beastie's &quot;Ill Communication&quot;.<br />Nonetheless, this is a solid effort.  The songs themselves are more pop-oriented and definitely less dangerous than the Velvet Underground, but, like VU, the Strokes' punkish ways seem to be more than poseur affectations.  It's easy to see why so many are hoping that this band ultimately heralds the renaissance of the New York club scene as it existed during its CBGB's heyday.<br />Ultimately, though, I don't see it.  It's unfair to label this as simply derivative, because it really sounds fresh; but the result seems like a finished product, not a new dawn.  It will be interesting to see where the band goes from here; my guess is that this is the male Elastica of the new millenium; an out-of-nowhere blast of great music, relevant only to its exact moment of time in the continuum.
0385505833|2.0|I expected a light read, but did not expect to be annoyed by this book!  There are many reasons why someone would choose (or wish) to skip Christmas, and many reasons why it would be almost impossible in our culture.  Grisham, however (or whoever wrote this, it isn't up to Grisham standards), only considers one (the materialistic excesses) and sets his scenes with a cartoon-like quality.  The first half is entertaining, but both the author and the character cave in to society's expectations, falling flat in attempts to express something about the &quot;real meaning of Christmas.&quot;  I was hoping this book might expand on the idea that there are as many expressions of the &quot;real meaning&quot; as there are Christians, and illustrate how one man searched for his own.  Alas.... Maybe next year.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I'm a huge No Doubt fan and I really enjoy this CD. A lot of long time No Doubt fans are po'd about this CD and accuse them of 'selling out' I don't understand that. Is it not a good thing that a band nowadays refuses to stay stagnant? Shouldn't a band want to evolve and try new things? That's what I love about No Doubt. They aren't afraid to try new things. This album is a combination of reggae dancehall/ska/80's synth/techno/hip-hop/disco/good old fashioned pop hooks. It's the ultimate party record, something for everyone to get grooving. No, not every song is perfect and the lyrics aren't anything especially deep and dark like 'Return of Saturn', but it's a party record and it's not meant to be deep. If you want deep, go play 'Return of Saturn' or a Fiona Apple/Nina Simone album.<br />Anyway, my favorite tracks would have to be <BR>1. The Waiting Room (produced by The Artist this is funky hip hop/techno beats. Definitely an awesome song to jit to. Hip hop heads will love these beats)<BR>2.Rock Steady (very soothing, puts me to sleep everytime)<BR>3.Platinum Blonde Life (awesome 80's synth/rock. Makes me wanna go platinum blonde)<BR>4.In My Head ( cool beats and synth keyboards. I love how Gwen says her name in the song)<BR>5.Don't Let Me Down<BR>(80's synth all theway. Also a bit ska flavored. Awesome track and the song for some reason makes me think of sparkles, pink, purple and blue in my head. Plus it reminds me [in the beggining of the song] of the theme for some 80's cartoon. Random, I know)<BR>6. Start The Fire ( the ultimate make up song. When you wanna just apologize to your man and let everything else go, because in Gwen's words 'the battlefield is tired' Great reggae flavor)<br />All killer tracks, but I love every other song on the album too. This is definitely a keeper, put it in at your next party. Definitely something for everyone.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This wasn't about Pearl Harbor, this was about how to tell another stupid love story with half-assed actors appearing to be bigger stars than they really are. If you took out the Pearl Harbor back drop and attack scene (which only last for about 10 min. in this long 3 hour movie), this would be another bad love story. Pearl Harbor was used as a way to get viewers to see another dumb Ben Affleck movie. I felt dupped. I wanted to see a story about PH and got this mess instead.
0064409422|5.0|I recommend this book to children of all ages.  It is an exciting story.  I really enjoyed it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|To begin with, I would give the film 5 stars if the DVD only came with the film. The plethora of extra features adds huge value to this DVD allowing for an even greater sense of awe as we recognise the amount of work and shear genius that went into the production of this extraordinary piece of art.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Any Godfather fan must have this set. You can put it next to the Sopranos. Just the Bonus Disc is worth the money. There is footage that wasn't in the previous collections and the story behind the story is very interesting. Badabing!! A collectors dream!!

0385505833|5.0|This is the perfect book to escape with. There is just to much reality these days and this is the perfect cure. At one point in the book(no I will not say when) I was laughing so hard I was crying. I can't remember the last time that happened. I would recommed this book for a quick,fast,fun read.
B00004YKUY|5.0|I may only be 16 but I know good music when I hear it and this is it. I've been listening to Journey since before I can even remember. My mom grew up with this band and gave me all of her cd's, I have almost every single one and not one of them has ever dissapointed me. I'm extremely happy that they're still around and still creating music. I will make sure my children hear these songs, and get my cd's and records. Journey rocks plain and simple.
6305751706|5.0|Ken Russell is one of the few directors who really brings a love of literature to his movies. His 1970 film of D.H. Lawrence's Women In Love remains one of the best filmed novels. But Ken Russell's tastes got wilder as he moved from film to film in the seventies and many of his seventies movies are a strange mix of high brow and low brow which pleases neither group really(Lisztomania, Mahler).  Then in 1979 he did a great horror film called Altered States which had him (ironically as it was a horror film) returning to the more controlled and coherent directorial style he exhibited before the period of excess. In the eighties he kept making horror films but they are very literate horror films, with a tongue in cheek kind of subversiveness which has fun with the material while not taking it too seriously. Gothic was made in 87.  I think its his best work of the horror genre and perhaps his best work since the D.H. Lawrence picture. Gothic has horror elements, in fact it is about the night that genre as we know it today was born. It is also very literate and its literary history is for the most part accurate. Julian Sands as Shelley and Gabriel Byrne as Byron make it seem like it was a lot of fun being a poet. They really act more like rock stars.... sex, drugs, and imagination is their daily regimen however. But the movie has a serious side too and a frightening side. Mary Shelley(Natasha Richardson) had a stillborn child and that is the impetus for her to write her famous Frankenstien. Everyone has deliriums but her deliriums which Ken Russell captures most poignantly keep the film from being just a romantic poet exploitation film. Her nightmares are based in real life horrors. She is really the center of this movie even though the male poets get to have all the fun and they do have a lot of bawdy and gaudy fun in that castle on the Swiss lake in view of Mont Blanc. This movie is visually stunning and at the end leaves you with an emotional resonance of having been through an unforgettable experience. Some people say Lair of the White Worm(Russells next film) is better than this but I don't see how. Gothic is a great looking film that takes a great story and adds to it all the visual delights the cinema has to offer but it is the story that remains with you. Lair of the White Worm is visually fun but there is no story to give those images a power or life beyond their momentary appeal. Gothic will appeal to those who know a bit about the romantic poets and painters and like their movies to have at least some redeeming value but can also have a purely visual and sensual appetite as well.hrough an unforgettable experience.

0525946284|4.0|This is a remarkable book.  It begins with the assertion&quot; Exactly fifty women were sent into France as secret agents by the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War.  Of those, thirty-six survived the war.  The other fourteen gave their lives.  This book is dedicated to all of them.&quot;<br />b<br />Follett starts with those facts and then builds a story around the best of the women agents being assigned the job of blowing up the most important telephone exchange connecting the German military between France and Germany and doing it during the week preceding the invasion at Normandy.  Follett communicates the sense that destroying this exchange will make the German response to invasion much slower and thus save lives and increase the chance that the greatest risk of the Second World War, the Normandy invasion, would succeed.  He then creates a German intelligence officer who is determined to roll up the resistance before the invasion can occur.<br />The contest between allies and Nazis builds to a level of tension that is palpable.  The risks people took to defeat Nazi Germany and secure safety were stunning.  The notion of people dropping into France again and again on secret missions with their lives at risk every minute comes through in this book with a force that grips the reader.  The sense of Nazi brutality and ruthlessness is captured in a very realistic sense of what Nazi occupied France was like.<br />Anyone who doubts that evil can exist and that decent people have to risk everything to defeat evil will have their doubts erased by this novel.  Follett has done it again.
B000001EL3|5.0|Destroyer followed ALIVE!, a tough act to follow...the ground breaking quintacential Live album of all live albums.  They had to do a studio album that could stand up to the bombastic ALIVE!<br />So many of the songs off DESTROYER are refered too again and again.  When you think of KISS, you think of Detroit Rock City!  This album was the theme album that all other theme albums had to live up to...it Has everything!!! a hard rock anthem, and a stellar rock ballad: BETH.  Destroyer also gave birth to Gene Simmons trademark: GOD OF THUNDER; complete with its accidental studio effects in the background! ( It was an accident, but it sounded good so they left it in!)<br />In short, in 1975-76 This was the album that converted millions of skeptics into lifetime fans!  Almost anyone that was around at the time has or had this album! Plain and simple; a landmark.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|It was very intersting to see this import DVD series.  As good as the Showtime version was, this is so much better.  Why? The guys are not as attractive, but the dialog and acting are so much better.  I thought the whole series that I saw was so realistic, no fancy sets, no contrived situations, no Hollywood sets, and so on.  This was not a musical from the 50's, this was the 90's. (...) <BR>A very realistic series, and slightly better than Showtime's QAS.
0385505833|5.0|After reading &quot;Painted House&quot;, I knew John Grisham was on a new level of writing. &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a perfect example of what I consider to be great comedy writing --- funny story and great characters. I hope he keeps it up in books to come. The plot is shallow enough to allow you to fly through the book in several hours, yet it's inspirational. The presentation reminds me of the well known &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; and the current not well known &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. I recommend that you also read the latter. I say &quot;also&quot; because you shouldn't miss &quot;Skipping Christmas, which I give 5 stars not only for the book, but for how clever Grisham was, conceptually, when he chose to write this book. Why, his motive for the book turns out to be the complete antithesis of the storyline. He foresaw the readers will do just the opposite of skip Christmas by purchasing his book for Christmas! He cleverly recognized the irony of it all --- and must be smiling all the way to the bank! Way to go, John!
B00005RFQ5|4.0|I will start this review by saying give this album a minimum of 1-2 weeks before you cast any judgements.  As I've already done so, I can say with clarity that Prince is still the man!  The Rainbow Children is definitely in the running for Best Prince Album.  True, Prince's sound &amp; creativity has never been the same prior to the break-up of the Revolution, but let me tell you...  The NPG can JAM!!!  This album showcases what I would call the best of the NPG era.  As I mentioned before, it took me a good 2 weeks to really get into the groove, but Prince &amp; TRC is here to stay.  The important thing is to hear this album with an open mind &amp; a passion for the man's music!  You'll be surprised...

B00003CXTG|3.0|THis movie is basically tooo long to watch and the plot has nothing to do with the attack on Pearl Harbor.<br />Although the attack scenes were well executed. Neverless the film was plagued with a very flawed script and stereotypical charactors.<br />The good parts of the movie is the production value and the attack sequences. Plus Jon Voight did a good job as the President. Plus a lot of good actors such as Cuba Gooding Jr and Tom Sizmore, Dan Akroyed and Alec Baldwin made cameo appearences.<br />But the draw back of the film is the script. Too many movies have love triangle plots and this movie is too long on that part. Also some charactors were stereotypical (especially the Japanese)<BR>Plus the editors did a bad job especially in the first part (pre December 7th). it is too long <br />This film also had historical inaccuracies. One of the most notable ones was that of Yamamoto. He did not go with the fleet. He stayed behind in Japan and sent his Vice Admiral (Nagumo) to carry out the attack. Also according to Japan, they attacked on December 8th (they are about a day ahead of us) but the movie showed their calandar December 7th. <br /> Overall the film is good. If you do not like love triangles I suggest you watch somthing else but if you can tolerate it then be my guess.<br />(here is a tip for you DVD owners. Skip a few scenes of the first part of the movie until the attack then watch the remaing part of the movie in full.<br />Hope you enjoy it.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is maybe not what I expected from this album, but then again I didn't really know what to expect. I'll make my point short and simple: in a world full of bland, manufactured pop music No Doubt is a breath of fresh air!!
B00005RFQ5|4.0|(...) I questioned whether he'd gone too far this time.....?<br />Whilst the album does not hit the highs of his earlier stuff , it is still what you come to expect from the purple one... Funk of abundance, fantastic production, a twist of the unusual and a religious underbelly.<br />Some people found the  voice-over links off-putting but It allows the concept album to flow nicely.  The album reminds me of modern Harry Connick Jnr (not the big band stuff) with the voice links and mix of musical genres.  If you like that - you will probably like this.<br />Over all a very good album with a hedanistic mixture of jazz, funk, rock, catchy riffs and a few bizarre twists!

0553213105|3.0|Most of the reviews I read (I had a big project to do)that were negative were from people who said &quot;Yeah, the book was like, really hard and stuff. And it was long.&quot;  I found that these people just didn't understand it. So basically, don't pay attention to these people. :) It took me a while to get through Pride and Prejudice for an AP English project.  I agree with other reviewers that it was extremely well written.  However, I found the storyline to be rather transparent.  It's not a novel to read if you want a deep, insightful book.
6304169558|2.0|I own Twister, and have owned it since its release. I do admit, it is rather creative with the special effects and all, but the story stunk! &quot;We can increase warning time to 15 minutes&quot; as Jo said, yeah right, 15 min. to spend at the TV and watch the whole warning gives the Tornado time to reach you. Did you notice the growling sounds they used for the twisters? With the first tornado they actually used a Camel's snort. Also with the water spouts, notice when they are watching the cow blow by them, that in the background they are really on a highway and another car passes them. And the ending? Who can survive an F5 tornado while being strapped down on some pipes? Nobody for goodness sake. They would have been torn to bits. Anyway, you'll notice the flaws once you buy the movie. But please, it's a total loss of money.
0395951054|1.0|Mein Kampf<BR>By Adolph Hitler<br />Mein Kampf is one of the most bizarre books I have ever read.  The tittle, when translated into English means My Struggle.  Personally, my struggle was just getting through the first half of the book!  I only hope that this look lost some of its meaning when it was translated from German.  That would be a pretty good excuse for a book that was very confusing. Hitler uses analogies to explain everything.  I wish he would have just come out and say what was on his mind.  This would have saved me a lot of time.                                              I have to admit, once you read through this book, it does start to make more sense.  What he says explains why he hated the Jews so much.  I just think that a 700 hundred-page book on Hitler's political views is a little too much.   But, if you like long books about European politics, this is the book for you, but I wouldn't recommend it.

B00003CXTG|1.0|make sure you rent this first - chances are you won't buy it.<BR>The attack part is great, but the other 90% of the movie is awful. The lines are SO CHESSY my friends and I were actually laughing during at the movie. Not a good thing for a movie that is supposed to be about Dec. 7.<BR>Most of the movie is a love story that is just silly. If you want to see a good Pearl Harbor movie, get Tora tora tora. This one will leave you with no clue about what happened that day.<BR>I really couldn't believe how bad this was. With one of the biggest days in history, and an unlimited budget, there is no excuse for this movie!
B00003CXDB|5.0|Some people might say Wall Street is nothing like that portrayed in this movie, while others would say it's all too much like this (to this very day).  Watch the movie.  Then think back on all the news articles you've read and/or TV stories you've watched regarding Wall Street and decide for yourself.  I definitely like this movie, and consider it a full-fledged five star-er.  The acting is superb, and the drama heart-felt.

Although the movie is, as was pointed previously, lack of any artistic value, the adrenalin rush you get out of it is very high. This is further hightened by the brilliant sound.<br />Buy it only if you love the movie. Use this to test your home theater system to the limits.

B00005QDW1|5.0|Like most people, I was hooked on No Doubt as soon as I heard their first big commercial success, Tragic Kingdom.  Gwen's voice is so wonderful and amazing, her writing is outstanding, and 'the guys' are some of the best musicians I've ever heard.  I'd have to say, though, that I gained a real respect for No Doubt after hearing Return of Saturn.  In my opinion, it is one of the best albums of all time - a polished collection of gritty, real emotions that still amazes me every time I hear it. <br />Rocksteady is almost a total 180 from Return of Saturn in style and subject matter, but it is an easy equal in terms of it's artistic merit.  Just like Return of Saturn, Rocksteady comes to me at the right time in life - with the world climate being as weird as it is , the light reggae/dancehall vibe and the familiar pop/rock beats are just what we need.  No Doubt's albums have taken me from college freshman, to college graduate, to married woman, to expectant mother.  Each time they've come out with an album, they've shown us how much they've grown as people and as a group, and it's absolutely mind blowing.  So take a 'mental' load off and buy Rocksteady.  You need it right now.
0792844793|5.0|This is a great movie!  I recommend it to anyone not afraid of seeing something different.  However, I must plead with the filmmakers to release another DVD with more features.  Commentary, interviews, deleted scenes, anything!  This is one of those movies that lives on in the imagination long after you see it, and I am dying to here a real commentary by David Lynch about what it means to him.
0345357116|5.0|The interesting thing to me about any story is thinking about what else is going on.  Characters do not live in a void where only their actions effect the outside world.  While many of the stories have no definitive ending or resolution contained herein, the resolutions come from other sources, such as the Hobbit, the Rings Trilogy or the Silmarillion.<br />For example, the Battle of Isen Ford concerning the death of Theodred, Theoden's heir is excellent source material.  It did not make sense in LOTR because we were not introduced to Theodred, because the Hobbits, who were the writers of the story, never met him - but he is referenced.  Yet we know what happened after those events, and his burial place is noted as the companions make their way to Isengard.<br />Another good example is how Gandalf met Thorin, Thrain his father, and convinced the Dwarves to go from the Blue Mountains to Bag End on their way to visit Smaug.  This is the prelude to There and Back Again (aka The Hobbit), and we know exactly what happened after the Dwarves arrived at Bag End, but where did Gandalf get that all important Map and Key?  <br />The story of the Istari's arrival is interesting, as is that &quot;Of Tuor&quot; (if you're a Silmarillion fan).  They are short stories in themselves, that are more fact based, with no endings or conclusions, but we know what happens in the end because it's already written elsewhere.  <br />Next to the Lays of Belerand, this is perhaps the best companion to the major works - although I haven't gotten through the Peoples of Middle Earth yet, maybe after I see the movie next week!  I do not view the stories in Unfinished tales as unfinished, but rather as pieces to be plugged into the greater story.
6305810109|5.0|This film is moving, strong, pure, and there are so many other things I could say about it, I'll have to stop now.  Farnsworth gives a touching and real performance matched by Spacek at her best.  David Lynch keeps surprising, and shows he can do anything he sets his mind to.

B00002ZMNV|5.0|This was an incredible concert, and it makes for one heck of a DVD.  I could watch this a thousand times and not get tired of it.  This DVD is the next best thing to having actually been there. If you're a Metallica fan and haven't checked them out with a symphony behind them, then you are missing out.  Just awesome!
B00003CXXR|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a major fan of the original Jurassic Park. I thought the story was original, the plot was exciting, and the acting was excellent. Then The Lost World: Jurassic Park II came out. I was disappointed to say the least. It was a bastardization of the entire series. With this said, I did not have high expectations when going to see Jurassic Park III.<br />However, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It is by no means as good as the first film, but it still provides a enjoyable movie experience. Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant and Laura Dern returns with a small role as Dr. Laura Satler. William H. Macy and Téa Leoni play somewhat annoying roles as a couple that hires Dr. Grant to take them on an tour of Isla Sorna (the island from the second film) via air plane. Of course they all end up on the island, and have to find an escape before they become dinosaur food. <br />Yes, the plot might not be original, but do not let that deter you from seeing the movie. The movie itself is considerably shorter than the previous films. An hour-thirty minutes compared to the other films running times of just over two hours each. This provides just enough time to really enjoy the movie before you might start to get bored with it (much like JP2).<br />The acting was excellent overall, especially by Sam Neill. The story was good. They kept the characters on the island for this film (No stupid dinosaurs in the middle of San Francisco this time). Basically the only problem I had with the film was that they made the kid smarter than the adults, much like in the first two films, but not to the extent that it was in the Lost World. Too much of the &quot;kid saves the day&quot; syndrome is going through the heads of Hollywood screenwriters these days.<br />Anyway, the flaws in this film really are minor, and I would recommend this film to any Jurassic Park fan. I enjoyed this film and look forward to watching it again. This is themovie The Lost World should have been. If you are new to Jurassic Park, definately start with the first (which is still the best). Otherwise rent or buy this movie to add to your collection.
0425180638|4.0|The Last Precinct is a great story for people who have become addicted to Kay Scarpetta. While the story in the Last Precinct was not as  thrilling in the end, there were moment that send chills up your spine.

It is absolutely hilarious for anyone who has a habit of spending out of control.  Becky's knack for &quot;rationalizing&quot; her situation is hilarious and at times you might think &quot;why can't she just get it together?&quot;.  Then you hang up the phone from ordering pizza or something from the shopping channel and you think &quot;Why can't I get it together???&quot;  This book is an excellent read for anyone who would like to laugh at themselves and their spending habits!
B00005O3VC|1.0|This disc can experience the following problem: Captioning that appears on screen regardless of what you select in the subtitles option. This disc has RCE (Regional Coding Enhancement) which may be the culprit. There is a site that addresses the RCE issue but the corrections shown there do not fix this problem. This problem does not happen with all DVD players so it's a crap shoot as to whether or not it will play properly for you. I suggest you just buy TSNKE (Thou Shalt Not Kill Except) on DVD instead.

B00005BJ2O|4.0|I am not a big fan of movie soundtracks, but after seeing Moulin Rouge on the 'Big Screen', I didn't make any hesitation. This is by far the best soundtrack I have ever heard, the songs here are incredible. They're mostly borrowed songs with altred lyrics to fit the story of the fim, which is pretty creative. <br />The best ones that I can recommend for you to listen to is: <BR>-Lady Marmalade<BR>-El Tango de Roxanne<BR>-Sparkling Diamonds<BR>-Elephant Love Medley<BR>-Your Song<BR>-Come What May<br />I LOVE the whole CD, but, those are my favorites. Don't take my word, check it out, and listen to it. And If you're going to see the movie or getting the CD, it's a bit better to know the original songs, becuase you can see the difference from the original version to the film version. You will also get some laughs when you hear the songs in this CD. There are also some songs that were left out, I hope that they're making a 2nd CD to complete the whole soundtrack of this movie.<br />As for now, I'm listening to this CD almost everyday to wait for the DVD of this movie. I am really anticipating the release with more features about the film.<BR>Hope u like it.

6304595247|4.0|The best thing about this adaptation was Ralph Fiennes' Heathcliff. He was frightening, abusive, unsympathetic one moment, yet the next could evoke my grudging sympathy. <br />Juliette Binoche was an acceptable Cathy, although the fact that she's just &quot;acceptable&quot; isn't her fault, since the director excised some of Cathy's best scenes. I don't know if he was trying to make the female characters more &quot;conventionally&quot; feminine, or just throw the movie to Fiennes, but most of the scenes where Cathy shows her fire and will, and especially her anger, are gone. In their place she is given a rather annoying giggle. <br />We miss her fits of temper when she invites Isabella and Edgar to Wuthering Heights, important because they show her true nature underneath the ladylike veneer.<br />We do see the crucial scene where she asks Ellen whether she should marry Edgar, and describes how she loves (or rather doesn't love) him. However, Cathy's description of her dream, where she is thrown from heaven back to Wuthering Heights, is missing.<br />Also missing is Cathy's magnificent temper tantrum following the argument between Edgar and Heathcliff, and her dramatic hallucinations following it, one of the most powerful points of the book. Instead, Cathy's wildness is inverted into depression.  <br />I felt sorry for Juliette Binoche, deprived of the challenge of these scenes. Leaving them out all but eviscerates the character of Cathy, and thus a significant part of the story.  In fact, I sometimes caught myself wondering just why Heathcliff felt so bonded to her.<br />Still, there were many good things. In other respects the movie is true to the book, certainly more so than the 1939 version. It uses Bronte's own words as much as possible, which is refreshing, considering how often with classics directors invent their own dialogue, ignoring language that has stood the test of time.<br />There is a definite energy between Catherine and Heathcliff. I particularly liked their early scenes on the moors. They do come across as a pair of kindred spirits. <br />The movie also gives a good feel for life back then, in scenes of the servants at work, or the graphic childbirth scenes. I particulary liked McTeer's Ellen, and that the relationship between Ellen and the two Cathies is less Mistress to Servant and more woman to woman.<br />Binoche gives a gifted performance as Cathy's daughter. She is believable even in the scenes with Heathcliff, which, considering that we've been seeing them as lovers for an hour before that, is quite an accomplishment. <br />However, I did think the movie should have given us a little time between the deathbed scenes and Binoche's reappearance as Young Cathy. We've just barely gotten over the unforgettable sight of Heathcliff holding Cathy's body in his arms before he is confronting Binoche as her uncle. <br />This is where another scene from the book could have come in handy: Isabella's escape from Heathcliff. After we see Isabella beaten down by Heathcliff's brutality, this is a satisfying moment, but the movie leaves it out.<br />The director adds one idea, to do with Cathy and her daughter, that I liked and won't spoil for the viewer. I also liked the way he wrapped the story back around, showing us the beginning from another angle. The ending scenes are worth the whole movie. I was amazed at how, even though I'd been virtually hating Heathcliff for much of the movie, at the end he won my sympathy. <br />I was not distracted by Sinead O'Connor, since I didn't recognize her, but only thought she looked and sounded perfect for Emily Bronte. Her narration adds just the right touch of ghostliness to the story. <br />In spite of its flaws, I highly recommend this to Bronte fans.

Then a priest (George Carlin) is changing a new regilion in a church in New Jeresy. Two fallen angels (Oscar-Winners:Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) may trigger the Apocalyspe if they succeed in reentering Heaven. An lasped Catholic woman (Linda Fiorentino), who has lost her faith has to stop them with the help of Two Slackers (Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith), a muse (Salma Heyek), The 13th Apostle (Chris Rock) and the voice of God (Alan Rickman).<br />DVD's has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This is a oddball comedy fantasy, which is not for all tastes. DVD's extras are great, including Commentary tracks, Deleted Scenes, Outtakes and more. This was also an modest hit at the Box Office. Smith, who directed and written the film made a unique one. Kevin Smith recieve an Independent Spirit Nomination for Best Screenplay. Super 35. Grade:A-.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I can safely say that this album is better than &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. It's got some groovy reggae/dancehall influences to it which is definitely far out! (don't get me wrong, ROS wasn't at all a bad album, I just felt there were a bit too many slow songs on it for my tastes) Some of my favorite tracks include &quot;Underneath It All&quot;,&quot;Hey Baby&quot;,&quot;Start The Fire&quot;, and the title track &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. Of course Rocksteady falls a bit short of No Doubt's first big release &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; but that's alright. Tragic Kingdom was a masterpiece that all No Doubters have and will be talking about for years to come. Capturing lightening twice isn't really all that easy!
B00003CXXS|4.0|The adventure takes a savage turn when famous palaeontologist Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) agrees accompany a wealthy explorer (William H. Macy) and his wife (Tea Leoni) on an aerial visit of Isla Soma, the old prehistoric animal bredding park. When the plane crashes, Dr. Grant & the Passengers have no choice but to face the creatures on the island, which are far more dangerous and vicious than they could ever imagine.<br />This is almost better than the Orignal but is much more better than the Flawed sequel-The Lost World:Jurassic Park. Steven Spielberg is surely miss as the director chair of the first two films but Filmmaker Joe Johnson (Jumanji, The Rocketeer) did an fine job directing the last in the series. The two flaws is too short and a bit too much humor but the film Visual Effects & Action-Adventure is non-stop. DVD has an great anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an cool sounding Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound). The DVD is Packed with Extras. Jurassic Park 3 is the most violent in the series. Grade:B+.
B000002UAR|5.0|I'm one of those so-called &quot;baby boomers&quot; (actually I don't remember booming when I was a baby) who bought the vinyl US  version of &quot;Revolver&quot; waaaayyyy back in August, 1966.  Needless to say, I wasn't very impressed.  Sure, I was a huge Beatles fan, but here I was with an LP featuring eleven songs... and only TWO John Lennon songs- both stuck like bookends to the ends of side one and side two.<br />Naturally, I thought it was strange that George had three songs. But Paul had FIVE songs.  Man, this &quot;Revolver&quot; album sure seemed lopsided in favor of McCartney.  I've read with interest some of the amazon.com reviewers claiming that &quot;Revolver&quot; doesn't rock enough, too many &quot;orchestral&quot; numbers.  These reviewers were reviewing the UK version- they would have completely HATED the US version on Capitol.  The rockingest songs were John's, with the exception of &quot;Taxman&quot;, and all the missing John songs from the UK &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions had been stuck on the &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; greatest hits compilation that Capitol released earlier in 1966 to make a quick buck (and give American Beatles fans a screwed-up progression of Beatles songs).<br />I ramble, but I really disliked &quot;Revolver&quot; when it came out in the US.  After hearing &quot;Revolver&quot; in its UK incarnation when the Beatles albums were released on CD back in the late '80s, I reallized that it's, overall, their crowning achievement at the peak of their creativity and cohesiveness as a group.  &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is still labelled their &quot;masterpiece&quot;, but &quot;Pepper&quot; didn't have such a stunning run of excellent songs.  There are tracks on &quot;Pepper&quot; that are obviously filler (Paul wrote &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; when he was a lad living in his Dad's council flat back in Liverpool).  &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; always seemed out of place.  I always cringed when I heard &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;-&quot;fun is the one thing that money can't buy&quot; has to be one of the most contradictory lines ever written.  If money can't buy fun, what can?!?  &quot;The rot had set in&quot; when the &quot;White Album&quot; was being recorded.  &quot;The rot&quot; had definitely set in by the time the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions were in full swing.  &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is a great album.  But it always seemed like an &quot;extra credit&quot; project.  The band had definitely &quot;passed the audition&quot;, but they flunked out as a band in the late '60s.  George Martin had to be conjoled to return to the booth for the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; sessions.  The Beatles, those bickering schoolmates from the &quot;White Album&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, decided to put the old school tie back on just one more time and dusted off the old school master to boot.<br />&quot;Revolver&quot; came out the month the Beatles embarked on their last tour anywhere, the 1966 tour of the US.  I saw the band live at Olympia Stadium in Detroit.  I was thirteen.  My older brother drove me to the Motor City to see my heroes.  I wasn't disappointed.  Just seeing them in the flesh was a thrill.  You couldn't hear them.  You could sort of feel them.  The screaming in that hall was beyond the threshold of pain.  Seeing the Beatles on stage was like gazing into the eye of a hurricane.  I can't imagine what it would've been like living in the center of that eye for almost five years, which the Beatles had been doing at the time I saw them live.  I can easily understand why they quit touring.  Listening to &quot;Revolver&quot; that same month, even in its butchered US condition, I found another reason why they would soon stop touring.  They couldn't perform their new songs live anymore as a four-piece band.<br />Listen to the beauty of &quot;Revolver&quot;.  Make a toast to the memory of George and John.  We'll never see their likes again.  There will never be another band like the Beatles.Enjoy their finest recording- all we have left is the music!

B00000BKDY|5.0|'Somewhere In Time' was my first taste of Iron Maiden. After hearing one of my friends rave about this band I've never really heard, I decided to buy an album and see for myself. At that time, I was very disillusioned with much of the metal I have been hearing. It was the time when dumb ass bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit were taking over for greats such as Metallica; and it was at this time that I was searching for a great metal band.<br />I don't know why I chose to pick up 'Somewhere In Time', but I do know that what I heard was one of the most original and fantastic metal recordings I have ever had the honor of listening to. This band was the holy grail I have been searching for! At that time, though, I found out that Bruce was doing his own solo thing and that Maiden had just recorded their second with Bailey.<br />'Somewhere In Time' made me a Maiden fan after one spin of the CD. If you have never heard any Iron Maiden, I would recommend this to be the intro CD to the band...it is one of their middle recordings, so there are many previous and post records available.<br />What really caught my attention were the beautifully crafted metal pieces. Songs such as 'Caught Somewhere In Time', 'Wasted Years', 'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner', 'Stranger In a Strange Land', and 'Alexander the Great' kept me captivated and drove me to buy every single Iron Maiden album (except for the yet-unreleased 'Brave New World') within a span of two months- speaking of overkill!<br />The only weak songs on the album are 'De Ja Vu' and 'Heaven Can Wait', though they are still great songs. And if you look closely at the cover art, you can spot symbolical clues to their previous albums...take for instance the pyramid in the back (powerslave), or the aces high bar (powerslave), or the phantom opera house (iron maiden), or the ancient mariner seafood restaurant (powerslave)...the list goes on and on...<br />This will forever be one of my special albums...because it introduced me to one of the greatest bands, and because it filled a heavy metal void within my soul...

B000009EAD|4.0|I was really surprised to hear modern European Metal influences in an American band. 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' was my first glimpse into Iced Earth (and by no means my last). Strong song writing, great vocals, and expert instrument playing made Iced Earth one of my fav's.<br />I hear so many influences in IE's metal...Metallica, Iron Maiden, and the list goes on! Not only that, but neo-Euro metal seems to have influenced them aswell...greats such as In Flames, Children of Bodom, and others. Iced Earth are what true metal is all about. Songs ranging from speed metal to slow ballads abound on this great album. I have long believed that no-holds-barred metal was dead in the United States...not the case here.<br />Songs such as 'Burning Times' and the entire 'Something Wicked...Trilogy' make you want to jump up, thrash about, and kick some Korn (...)!!! Whereas pieces such as 'Watching Over Me' bring out the heart of the band. And for those of you who are nostalgic for things such as Metallica's instrumentals (one every album...or so it was) shall rejoice as Iced Earth's '1776' is a great work of art.<br />If it weren't for industry controlled charts and radio, this band would surely surge to the top of the American metal scene; but as is the case with many great bands, Europe does not discriminate and cherishes metal (now and forever). So until the death of Carson Daly and his (...) companions, Iced Earth (and others) will remain golden treasures that only few will find.

B00003CXTG|5.0|(...)  To my wife and I we loved this movie, so much so we're proud to say we saw it in the theaters about a dozen times. It was by far the best alternative to the junk Hollywood turns out today.  It had everything, a love story, frindship, action, and so many stirring moments that were great, AND, I must say in all truthfulness that in all the times we saw the movie the audience would give it a respectful hand that showed they enjoyed it. Not only that the shows were always packed so word of mouth must have praised the movie. I don't understand where some people got upset with the love story.  Why not?  I seem to remember another great movie \\"Gone with the Wind\\" having a love story too, with other twists and turns.  The musical score was outstanding by Hans Zimmer. Maybe this movie will not be considered for any oscars but it was entertaining without being gross.  Facts?  Sure, maybe some facts got twisted some but the basic fact about what happen that day educated many people that never knew what took place that day.  I purchased the DVD and it is just as great to see as it was before.  To me the 3 hours went by pretty fast.  I recommend this movie as one of the best 10 movies ever.
0345448898|4.0|I was very impressed by these books, they showed me that children's books could open the minds of adults as well as young adolescents. The story is amazing, the plot immersive and spectacular, he combines the both with heart a warming charm, if only more people could write stories like this.<br />I am, however, quite annoyed at the publisher's for changing the name of the first book. 'Northern Lights' as it is called in the UK is a lot more apt considering the nature of the story, than the Golden Compass! What's that all about? The Alethiometer, which i'm assuming is what they are refering to is not a compass, it is something completely different. The fact that it looks vaguely like a compass is not the point, IT ISN'T A COMPASS and shouldn't be called such. <br />Why then have you changed the name? What was the point, why not call it Northern Lights'? I hope Philip Pullman was equally disgusted with the name change as i am. Thankyou very much.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I've seen this movie 5 times! I love it! It's funny and entertaining. I loved the animation... Everyone should at least see this movie once. Just for the experience. (smile) Great Buy. (smile)
B00005MM67|3.0|I have this movie in VHS format. I was waiting for a DVD release in WIDESCREEN. The movie was shot on location in British Columbia and Pakistan. Mountain scenery is beautiful and climbing sequences breathtaking. Music is great. While not without flaws of its own, the movie captures the excitement, beauty, and tragedy of mountain climbing. It is much wiser than recent releases such as \\"Vertical Limit\\". When the movie is formated to fit the screen 30% of the picture gets [cut]. I am waiting for a widescreen release.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus' new album is so solid that I can't believe that anyone could write the destructive comments that I have been reading. Their style has definitely changed, or should I say matured, with their last album. I am not in any way trying to say that their earlier style was poor or undeveloped, rather that their new cd reflects their undeniable talent in yet another way.<BR><BR>When I listened to Morning View I was blown away once again by Incubus' musical genius, which I attribute to the fact that &quot;their talents are too great to concentrate on one style of music.&quot; If you are truly an Incubus fan you would realize how great this album is instead of complaining about how much their sound has varied from what SCIENCE consisted of. Personally, I wouldn't want to hear another carbon-copy of SCIENCE; it was and still is good but I was both surprised and pleased to hear an expanded Incubus sound on Make and now Morning View; I want to see what they're capable of. In fact, if you are a true music fan in general, you would be open to any kind of music instead of restricting your musical tastes to one type of sound because &quot;it's your style.&quot; If you listen to this cd close-mindedly, wishing for another SCIENCE, you will miss out on some damn good music.<BR><BR>Brandon Boyd's voice definitely shines on this cd, especially in the more emotional tracks like Mexico, Echo, and 11am. These songs do not compare in any way to the corny, sappy songs akin to MTV-esque artists (sorry but it's true). Instead, these songs reveal raw emotion through Brandon's mesmerizing voice and simplistic and toned down instruments, like the low tones of string instruments in the background that add to the melancholy feeling of Mexico. Actually, Incubus experimented with a few new instruments on this cd, like the Japanese kyoto in Aqueous Transmission, that adds an exotic feel, creating a unique and relaxing track that is the perfect ending for the cd. There are also tracks which arecloser to the Incubus style we have become used to on Make Yourself, such as Warning and Have You Ever. Tracks like Under My Umbrella and Are You In , in my opinion, are a perfect mesh between Incubus' new and old style. DJ sound effects are not absent on this cd, but add just the right edge to certain songs, instead of being an overpowering sound throughout the cd like I had feared after Make Yourself's misfit Battlestar track (don't worry you won't be disappointed if you actually liked this track). <BR><BR>As for those who say that Incubus was giving in with this record to appeal to the likes of TRL and the pop scene, I think that is completely wrong. Incubus has started to collect more fans through the tremendous air time that they got with Drive, and continued air time might actually get them on TRL again because of their huge fan base. It will just mean that their music is good! But, what does it matter anyway, as I've seen the likes of Marilyn Manson and Korn on that show and I think everyone will agree when I say they didn't &quot;sell out&quot; with their music to get on at all. Incubus has remained true in that they're still producing stellar (pun intended) music that hasn't faltered since their debut album. All in all, I highly recommend that you buy this CD because it is an excellent representation of Incubus' wide range of talent and it is WELL worth your hard earned cash.
B00005B6N8|4.0|Pith Black surpassed all hopes I had for the movie going into it.  I expected crap for acting and marginal special effects with a cliched loaded plot.<br />Now, there were a few cliches, but I could look past them.  Aliens eating people that run around in the dark saying stupid things isn't exactly what you call &quot;fresh&quot;.  But, none-the-less, Pitch Black was a good movie.<br />Vin Diesel was obviously the most talented actor, and he pretty much carried the load.  This wasn't really an all-star cast, but the unknowns did well enough.<br />The special effects, lighting, and cinemotagraphy were just fantastic.  Some of the best that I have seen for a while.<br />Pitch Black is a greatly underrated film and shouldn't be blown off for lack of imagination.  Make sure you aren't in a Dark room while watching. 4 Stars
B000002GY9|4.0|This album is nothing short of astonishing. It is a sort of culmination of Tom Waits's early work, his archetypal 70's album. He remains lyrically &quot;chained to the same bowl of vomit&quot; (as Nick Cave once put it so eloquently), which in his case is the seedy, late night, underworld of bars with beer-stained carpets and smoke-filled air. This does focus less on scene-setting and more on character sketches and narratives, but the lyrics are pure Waits: full of the off-color imagery and crazy internal rhyming that is distinctly his. The album is divided between jazzy, piano-based songs (with occasional orchestral backing), and a few more musically mundane pieces, featuring something along the line of spoken-word pieces. The first song is the excellent Tom Traubert's Blues (God only knows where some of Waits's song titles come from) - this is the first Waits song that I ever heard, and, when I heard it, the voice almost knocked me out. It's just yet another signature element. Step Right Up is a hilarous scat piece. Other highlights include Invitation To The Blues, The One That Got Away, and the surreal title track. This album also includes two of Waits's all-time classic songs, The Piano Has Been Drinking and Bad Liver And A Broken Heart (possibly one of my favorite songs of his.) This is certainly an essential Waits album, and it's not a bad place for a new fan to start.

It has fantastic solos by Zappa as well as George Duke and John Luc Ponty;as well as great on-tact background support from Ruth Underwood , Bruce and Tom Fowler, Sal Marquez ,and  great blasting vocals from Ricky Lancelotti. I you buy this album you'll want to listen to it again and again. This album is the turning point in Zappa's music!
0440219078|5.0|I first read this book in fifth or sixth grade, and it was an amazing introduction into more evolved ways of thinking and more abstract concepts.  It challenges conformity and conservatism even in our own society, but its focus is on this utopian society and the character of Jonas.  It's beautifully, sensitively written, and I enjoy it even today.  This is a great read for middle and high school students because it challenges their ways of thinking and introduces what seem (to middle schoolers) to be lofty concepts.  Excellent novel.
B00005NI5Y|3.0|I have followed Dylan for over 30 years; the man can still write stories within songs...but his singing voice is shot...that is a pity because the stories keep you in the music while his voice is very grating on your ears...
B000002AHM|5.0|Most of the time it seems we consider music as background noise, but this is the kind of music that you will enjoy just listening to. My first taste of flamenco was Ottmar Leibert, but after, stumbling onto this CD, Leibert's music seems almost like &quot;muzak&quot; to me now... a bit anemic compared to this incredible recording. I highly highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves jazz, flemenco, or the guitar.
6304083769|5.0|[NOTE: Considering that the storyline has been dealt with ad nausem, I'll try to highlight the more &quot;Philosophical&quot; points of the Movie] <br />Hailed as a piece with no equal, &quot;GitS&quot; provides the viewer with both a Visually Stimulating Picture coupled with a more Mentally Irritating Storyline that could possibly cause you to think of the Philosophy of Machines and Souls.<br />Probably drawing upon the question &quot;Do machines dream of electric Sheep?,&quot; the film raises the question about machines being sentinant lifeforms like us, with a soul, and rational thought. It also dwells into the ethics of technology, and how it quietly inflitrates society and in time, subvertly takes control. (The quote in the begining of the film highlights this point somewhat.)<br />The main chracter, Major Motoko Kusanagi, deals with questions concerning her body. She is nothing more than a Cyborg Body with very few of her &quot;original&quot; bodyparts left from her previous body. She begins to doubt her existance, and even her limits, trying to find answers to her questions. But she does find some solace in the main &quot;villan&quot; in the film, which leads to a very intense debate that couldn't have been written finer by a Professor at some Ivy League College in Philosophy.<br />This film provides something for everyone; Girls with Guns, Intense Action Scences, and for the Academics, questions concerning Machines and Souls, Ethics of Technology, and I think a debate on Evolution. In fact, some Professors use this film (And others) for their classes.      <br />I suggest you try to watch both sides, as both seem to interact with each other. Who knows, perhaps you can learn something from a cartoon?
0525946284|4.0|Ken Follettâs latest novel â~Jackdawsâ(I love this title)turns to WW2 and a little known organization that goes by the acronym SOE.<br />Itâs the week before D-Day. 28-year-old Felicity â~Flickâ Clairet, an agent for the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which specializes in sabotage behind enemy lines, is in charge of destroying an important telephone exchange station in France. After the first mission fails she returns to London to look for recruits for a brave new plan that will take them into the exchange itself. These recruits will be comprised of nothing but females (and quite a group this turns out to be).<br />Dieter Franck is the German, working under Rommel, who is set out to stop the resistance movement. He soon becomes Flickâs archenemy. Dieter is a skilled interrogator and a ruthless torturer who has a knack of getting the truth out of his enemies.<br />The cat and mouse scenario between Flick and Dieter drives this novel to its very satisfying conclusion. It has an odd assortment of characters, some youâll like and some youâll hate. This is not one of Follettâs more memorable novels but it is still worth your time if youâre a fan. The plot didnât really draw me in until the second half of the book, and thatâs when it grabbed hold and wouldnât let go. I will continue to be a Follett fan.<br />Recommended.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I have 4 of ND's albums now and have been a longtime fan of their's.  I completely agree with Aqua's review, this album is actually pretty good once you listen to it a few times.  Each one of their albums is completely different, from their self titled to Rock Steady.  The music industry is one of constant change and if you don't keep up with the changes, you will be labeled as the &quot;same old tired formula&quot;.  I too, was skeptical about this album but it always seems that the more you listen to a ND CD, the more you like it.  Their single, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; is actually one of the weaker spots in the album and I personally think that the guest vocalists take away from the CD but luckily they are just a small part.  Other than that, some of the song's tempos could use some speeding up.  Gwen's voice is awsome as always!  My favorite's are &quot;Detective&quot; &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Start The Fire&quot;.  No this isn't a ska album but it's a darn good pop album!!

0517122707|5.0|This book is the dogs undercarriage, I laughed so hard my pyloric valve snapped shut.  Ignatius is a comic masterpiece and probably the funniest character I have ever encountered.  His work for Levy Pants will leave you in stitches.  Read this book.  If you don't like it, you're obviously a mongoloid.
B00004XQP4|4.0|!WARNING!<BR>Some portions of this album DO NOT sound like traditional Green Day material! Casual fans may not enjoy as much as they liked, say, Dookie.<br />You've probably heard the first single from the new album, &quot;Minority,&quot; on your local radio station. You may even have enjoyed it, and bobbed your head along to it. There's a reason that it's the first single: it's a song that you can still recognize as being the musical spawn of Green Day, yet introduces some of the newer elements of the album -- like an acoustic guitar intro and harmonica. Most of the album is in the vein of the less-familiar Green Day elements, which is not to say that it's a bad album. It's certainly not.<br />A few songs are basic Green Day stock: good to sing along to (even if you don't know all the words), fast distorted guitar power chords, and the occasional swear word. The biggest un-Green-Day element in the album, though, is the amount of clean guitar sound, or rather, the lack of guitar distortion. While it makes for a tighter musical sound overall, it certainly sounds slick, radio-friendly, and not at all &quot;punk rock.&quot; But actually, the only thing keeping many of the songs on the album -- songs like the title song and opener &quot;Warning,&quot; and &quot;Jack Ass&quot; -- from being called &quot;punk&quot; is the fact that they seem to be played at about half-tempo; were drummer Tre Cool playing doubletime, they'd be rockin' punk anthems.<br />Probably the biggest shocker to fans will be &quot;Misery,&quot; a tango-like selection that features mandolins, organ-sounding keyboard, and accordion. Lyrically, it's Green Day (&quot;they found him in a Cadillac/bludgeoned with a baseball bat/in the name of misery&quot;), but musically, those who don't appreciate a wide musical spectrum will be taken aback and possibly offended by the song.<br />But for those who are wondering, &quot;Where did my precious, punk-pop Green Day go? Will I never hear of them again?&quot;, fear not. &quot;Castaway&quot; is feel-good, sing-along-in-the-car, future-radio tune; &quot;Blood, Sex and Booze&quot; harkens a bit to the swingin'-ness of Nimrod's &quot;Hitchin' A Ride&quot; (and with lyrics like &quot;You know I will obey/so please don't make me beg/for blood, sex and booze you give me&quot;, how could you NOT wanna play this for your kid sister?). &quot;Church On Sunday&quot; is so bright that it may be played on your local &quot;best mix of the '80s, '90s and today&quot; station, but contains the only odd rhythm on the entire album (triplets in the final chorus), and &quot;Fashion Victim&quot; is as close to the driving anger-rock of Insomniac as the album gets.<br />However, it's unfortunate that the band has tried to capitalize on the popularity of last year's balladic smash &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; with the album's closer &quot;Macy Day Parade,&quot; which begins with a fairly monotonous guitar strum and continues to bore until the chorus is reached, at which point there's an actual chord progression (surprise!), as well as the addition of either a small string section or a synthesizer on the &quot;violin&quot; setting. It's not a badly-written song, just rather poorly performed -- it would be much more effective as an acoustic ballad if the guitar part were fingerpicked and some other orchestral-type instruments were added. But if that were to happen, the cries of &quot;SELLOUT!&quot; would echo so loud that no one would hear the new instruments anyway.<br />On the whole, Warning seems a lot mellower than any previous recordings (contributed to mostly by the lack of guitar distortion and pot-smoking tempos), which is not necessarily a bad thing. The album has its high points (&quot;Castaway,&quot; &quot;Waiting&quot;) and its low points (&quot;Hold On,&quot; with a particularly repetitive and slightly irritating harmonica part), and the order of the songs could stand to be diddled with (probably not the best idea in theworld to open the album with a slow-tempo number like &quot;Warning&quot;, and there are four songs in a row that have approximately the same beat and similar chord progressions, leading to the feeling that you've been listening to the same song over and over again), but in general is a shiny, sweet-smelling package. At least, it is for die-hard fans -- who are probably the only ones still interested in buying the album after the three-year period since Nimrod hit the stores.
B00004U2HK|5.0|At 33 years of age, I finally saw the Sound of Music...and I thought it was wonderful!  Although the movie is nearly three hours long, it possesses so much charm and beauty that I truly enjoyed every minute of it.  The segment in which Maria and the children perform \\"the lonely goatherd\\" puppet-show alone justifies purchasing the movie.  Other stand-out scenes include the nuns singing about how to solve \\"a problem like Maria,\\" Julie Andrews teaching the children about music with the song \\"Do Ray Mi,\\" and the children telling the guests at their father's party goodnight with the \\"Cuckoo\\" song (\\"Adieu, adieu...to you and you and you\\").  Also, the scenary Austrian countryside is absolutely breathtaking!      <br />The Sound of Music is definitely worth seeing.  Don't just take my word for it.  Of the 233 reviews of The Sound of Music which have been posted on Amazon at this time (12/12/01), only 18 gave this film less than 4 stars.  Furthermore, 10 of these 18 mediocre reviews were only critical of the technical aspects of the DVD, and praised the actual film.<br />Of course, the eight people who truly didn't enjoy The Sound of Music have every right to give it a negative review, and shouldn't be criticized for their honesty.  Even so, I feel a little sad that they didn't have the wonderful experience I had with this movie.  (...)

B00004Z459|5.0|This is the best of whats out. If you like rock i FULLY recomend this CD. I sing it all day at school!!
0792839730|4.0|this movie shows just how good an all star cast can go. It is very long. Yet i find it vivid, moving, exciting. It is surely one of the last of the good old war movies. The film makes itself like the longest day an overrall lenghty adaption of one of world war 2's monumental battles. they both don't get into the horrors of war like Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan. Yet they glamourously display the mode and movement of the battles themselves. This is what keeps this film going besides the fairly decent action sequences and engagements, the strong acting, and/or very well detailed showing of the allied and german commanders striking in the battle. I like The longest day a little more than this but i still like A bridge too far.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Ok, so the album lacks the direction it needs to establish a firm audience, but when every song is THIS GOOD, anyone who appriciates good, solid music should buy this cd. I don't know if a better song has been released than &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; last year. Other standouts include the rock numbers &quot;Fool&quot;, and &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot;, One of the nicest love songs I've heard in a while is &quot;The One&quot;, and for a fun, latin meets rock number, check out Objection (Tango). Shakira's vocals and amazing songwriting skills are the only constant elements of the disc. It's quite the mish mash of sound, but even if you find it confusing, every song is strong, and worth a listen.
0385505833|5.0|Picked this up at the airport and thoroughly enjoyed waiting for my flight.  Not what I would have expected from Grisham, but I found this book quite enjoyable.  Plot is different, entertaining, and easy to read.  Not a lot of fluff like you find in most books.  Good reading, great gift idea.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The British music press have, in the last few years, been desperately looking for a band that can dispell once and for all the notion that &quot;rock is dead&quot;. And try they did by hyping the likes of &quot;Jonathan Fire Eater&quot; and &quot;At The Drive In&quot;- bands that <BR>promised much but never really delivered the goods. Then five impossibly good looking young men from New York strutted on to their shores a few months back and released the intriguing<BR>&quot;Modern Age&quot; Lp, followed a series of &quot;you had to be there&quot; <BR>gigs across the country. When they finally released their debut album- a tight, ground breaking thirty six minute ode to the highs and lows of hedonist youthdoom- media pandemonium enevitably (and justifiably) enshewed.<BR> Of course there's always gonna be the detractors, the unenlightened (i.e. Elton John &quot;They're a bit too retrogressive for me&quot;)who intolerant of the constant &quot;cry wolfing&quot; of the music press, barely hear one song before lazily attaching tags like &quot;copyists&quot; or &quot;retro&quot;. But really these sterotypes only apply to the bands satorial tastes on stage and have very little relevance to the music. Ok I'll admit theres a palpable Reedian twinge to Casablancas voice on &quot;The Modern Age&quot; where his high shrieking &quot;whoooo&quot; sounds like a sample lifted straight from an early Velvets album. Not to mention the simple two chord assualt music progression over which our mans proclamtion he's &quot;in the sun sun having fun it's in my blood&quot; owes a heavy due to Reeds subtextual niavete in Heroin &quot;it's my wife and it's my life&quot;. Still that song's an exception. One out of eleven ain't bad for a band still on the early cusp of their twenties, afterall the Beatles had barely begun to write songs at that age. <BR> The Strokes one really affinity with the Velvets, NY origins aside, is their ability to extract all the best elements of the music that predatedthem to create an original new sound. So whilst theres a base zone of hipster familiarity -a Voidoids inspired solo here; &quot;Alone Together&quot;, an Iggyish yelp there; &quot;NY City Cops&quot; (aka track 9), the listener is then plunged into some sublime unchartered musical territory- the sinsterly weird nursery rhyme chorus which is &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, the divine juxtaposition of the melancholy guitars and happy bassline on the albums opening track to name a few. Music this good needs to be heard.'nough said.
B000001FO4|5.0|Cinderella's debut featured bluesy rock which was reminiscent of AC/DC.  On their follow up they up the rootsiness factor while still rocking in late 80's fashion.  The result is a winning album that is an overlooked classic of 80's hard rock.<br />The album starts off with some harmonica and a national steel guitar while Tom Keifer sings a blues as an intro to &quot;Fallin' Apart At The Seams&quot;.  It works wonderfully.  It's worked so that the key riff of the hard rocker is alluded to and then played on intentionally &quot;historic&quot; sounding guitar.  &quot;Gypsy Road&quot; follows which is another riff rocker with a riff Keith Richards probably wishes he wrote.  Following that is the excellent &quot;Don't Know What You Got Till It's Gone&quot; which is a fantastic power ballad.  Probably the best thing about it though, not to detract from the song, is Tom Keifer's excellent solo.  Another standout rocker in &quot;The Last Mile&quot; follows.  Other standout tracks include &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot; which is in the vein of Led Zeppelin's &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; with some stirring guitar and &quot;Coming Home&quot; which is a great country rock ballad.  &quot;If You Don't Like It&quot; is the kiss-off/screw you song that every good rock album needs and works on that level.  &quot;Second Wind&quot; and &quot;Fire And Ice&quot; recall the band's debut &quot;Night Songs&quot; with the latter being the superior track.  &quot;Take Me Back&quot; rounds out the album with some kickng drums with cowbell and a great slide riff, and a rootsy upbeatness.<br />The thing about this and Cinderella's next album (&quot;Heartbreak Station&quot;) is that they started showing a way out of being pigeon holed in the &quot;hard rock&quot; scene.  Cinderella were stretching the boundaries of what the hard rock and mainstream audiences would accept.  At the same time though there were rockin' out with a fury.  Tom Keifer's Janis Joplin/Brian Johnson voice may not befor everyone, but the guy always played a mean guitar, and here with Jeff LaBar is just a great rock CD.  It's been lumped in with dreck for so long.  It stands up a lot better than many of the stuff that was on &quot;Headbanger's Ball&quot; at the same time.  And maybe oneday &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot; will be acknowledged as the great rock album it is.
B00005LOUS|5.0|It's not the Grinch story most of us remember from the past, the Dr. Seuss version, but this is still an excellent movie.

My Mom actually bought this movie for my children, but my husband and I enjoyed it just as much as the children.
0380788624|2.0|In CRYPTONOMICON, a massive (900 page) tome that interweaves plotlines of World War II codebreaking and modern-day data security, Neal Stephenson continues to explore how technology influences our lives and unlocks exotic futures. Stephenson's first novel concerning the advent of the digital era, 1991's SNOW CRASH, was a highly entertaining and satirical romp that I quite enjoyed. I found CRYPTONOMICON, however, disappointing.<br />The basic gist of CRYPTONOMICON is that the actions of a handful of intelligence experts, led by USN Captain Lawrence Waterhouse, and a Marine, Bobby Shaftoe, to conceal from the Axis that they had broken ENIGMA affect the efforts of Waterhouse's grandson Randy, and several of his coworkers, to construct a &quot;data haven&quot; in SE Asia. This data haven would allow individuals to communicate in total privacy as well as pave the way to true electronic currency. Hidden Japanese and Nazi gold figures too, and Randy teams up with Shaftoe's granddaughter Amy in an adventure to increase shareholder value, avoid lawsuits, and save the world from future Holocausts. Does that sound complex? It is. CRYPTONOMICON is a large book, and although one may argue that 900 pages is a bit much, this book would have to be large no matter how tightly edited it was. Some of the book's bulk is due to cameos of key figures from the 1940's (Alan Turing gets mocked, Douglas MacArthur becomes a hilarious parody of himself), but I found these amusing.<br />Nonetheless, CRYPTONOMICON is a bit foggy in its moral messages. Instead of using the word &quot;Japan,&quot; Stephenson always uses &quot;Nippon,&quot; thus instead of &quot;Japanese&quot; one finds &quot;Nipponese.&quot; It seems to at least this reader that Stephenson is trying to avoid blaming Japan for its actions in World War II as to not offend a Japanese audience for his book. Nonetheless, there are parts in the book where Stephenson does speak of the horrors inflicted by the &quot;Nipponese&quot; army in Nanking and New Guinea, so perhaps he isn't an apologist for imperial Japan. One other hazy moral point is that Stephenson draws short of outright criticism of US intelligence activites, and its most infamous organization the National Security Agency. He merely dances around the point that although fifty years ago codebreakers saved the world from Hitler, nowadays they are more dedicated to economic espionage and violating the privacy of individuals than serving democracy. These two issues should have been presented more clearly, so that the reader can see who is good and who is bad in each plotline of the book and in real-life. Stephenson does however give a delightful view of the McCarthy-ish creation of the NSA in Comstock's diatribe against &quot;communist homos,&quot; but it comes very late in the book and doesn't change the preceding 800 pages.<br />For all its complex plot mechanics and geek subculture, CRYPTONOMICON is surprisingly lowbrow. There is an uncomfortable amount of profanity and pointless sex which is rather not like Stephenson. The book also lacks the wealth of gee-whiz ideas which characterize his earlier works. SNOW CRASH wasn't exactly great literature, but it did have a wide range of futuristic notions that are only now coming into being.<br />Well, CRYPTONOMICON was certainly a let-down to me. For those unfamiliar with Neal Stephenson's writing, I would wholeheartedly recommend SNOW CRASH. For fans of Stephenson who wish to move on to CRYPTONOMICON, I would suggest waiting for its rumoured sequel to come out and seeing from its reviews whether the second volume makes the first worth reading.n Nanking and New Guinea, so perhaps he isn't an apologist for imperial Japan.

B000002BFZ|4.0|I bought this album because of &quot;In My Tree&quot;. Its a spiritual journey elevated by one of the best complex drumbeats around, and raging riffs that build to a crescendo. The song simply explodes as Vedder screams, &quot;Up here so high I start to shake/up here so high the sky I scrape&quot; I think its Pearl Jams finest.
B000003S0P|5.0|First, be forwarned. Labelling this album as 'a progressive rock gem' might send out wrong messages as it isn't anything like what other 'prog rock' bands have ever done - it isn't anything like Yes, Genesis or ELP. So don't expect Wakeman-like moog arpeggios , extreme polyrhythmic timeshifts or outer space lyrics. Even for Robert Fripp's standards, much of the guitar playing on RED is actually restrained despite its overwhelming density and power.<br />RED is ultimate rock - and might as well be ranked along with the heavyweights such as Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, Cream's Wheels of Fire, or any other rock classic. However, RED stands out for its incorporation of a more avant garde approach, much emphasized improvisation (although it is one of the least -improvised album from the whole Crimson catalogue !)and atonality perhaps. Don't be deceived by the fact that this album only contains 5 tracks. One listen, and your life will be changed forever.<br />Other reviewers have perfectly described their analysis on each track, so all I can say is you might expect it to be the (probably) only rock album to be liked by Nirvana and Weather Report fans alike.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Let's start off by saying that this has all been done before.  the Strokes look, music and style is way overplayed.  The music is at best mediocre and they are by no means the saviors of rock and roll.  if you can, download this album so as not to waste money on it because there are plenty of other great bands that you could give your money to.  in a city like NY these guys are a dime a dozen.
B0000029DD|4.0|GRACE was Jeff Buckley's first album and sadly the only album ever released by him, as he died in a tragic drowning accident in 1997. GRACE contains moments of instrumental glory, presided over by Jeff's passionate voice. \\"Mojo Pin\\" is a well-written opening track, beginning with a slow introduction and ending in a maelstrom of guitar and wailing vocals. \\"Grace\\" is emotion made song.<br />One must, however, consider GRACE a landmark album only because it was Jeff's first and shows the potential that he had as a musician. If Jeff had lived to release another album, calling GRACE a masterpiece would be like calling a baby's first steps a spectacular ballet performance. There are positively dull moments on GRACE, such as Jeff's cover of the Leonard Cohen travesty \\"Hallelujah.\\" I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels it's a shame Jeff wasted his talent on Cohen's painfully contrived lyrics. \\"Lilac Wine\\" is also a rather annoying track.<br />I am a fan of Tim Buckley, and came to Jeff's work hearing that he was Tim's son. For someone familiar with Tim Buckley's work, Jeff's songwriting is an interesting perspective. Jeff only met his father once, spending a week with him when he was 8 years old, but in spite of the absence of a relationship between them, echoes of Tim permeates the songs of Jeff. In \\"Mojo Pin,\\" Jeff sings of love in a masochistic sense (\\"Send whips of opinion down my back/give me more\\") like his father did in the infamous 1973 album GREETINGS FROM L.A. Most haunting, however, is the final track on GRACE. In \\"Dream Brother\\" Jeff begs a friend not to abandon his pregnant girlfriend and unborn child like Tim abandoned Jeff. \\"Don't be like the one who made me so./Don't be like the one who left behind his name,/'cause they're waiting for you/like I waited for mine/and nobody ever came.\\"<br />Jeff Buckley's work is truly \\"alternative\\" music and may not appeal to those whose music tastes run to the mainstream. His use of unusual time signatures and song structures can be best compared to Red House Painters, although Jeff's song do not use acoustic instrumentation as much as RHP. GRACE also requires a few listens to grown comfortable. I would recommend GRACE to those who have eclectic tastes, and I'm certain that any listener on hearing the album will reflect on what a shame it is that such a talented musician was lost so young.res can be best compared to Red House Painters, although Jeff's song do not use acoustic instrumentation as much as RHP.

B00005K3LU|5.0|I like this movie a lot, so I bought the dvd.  The dvd is good too -- great picture and sound quality.  I highly recommend it.<br />For those of you who haven't seen the movie at all, here's some reasons for you to see it and buy the dvd: there's a part in the movie where willis is running around with bare feet and steps on some glass (the bad guys broke some windows).  Later, you get to see him picking the glass out of the bottoms of his feet (ouch!).  I liked that part.  There's this other part too: there's this hostage business guy who thinks he's cool and tries to negotiate with Hans and the other bad guys.  He promises to make willis give in and tell where the explosives are at, but he can't do it.  Then Hans kills him! (Willis was watching, too.)  I wasn't expecting that at all.  I thought either Willis would come to the rescue or the hostage guy would just be let go.  But no.  That was pretty unexpected for me.  So I liked that part a lot too.  And one more thing.  Bruce Willis's performance is really good.  I love his facial expressions.  Like, remember the look on his face in Pulp Fiction when he's about to escape from those sick gay guys, but then decides to grab a weapon and go back, to save the other guy that hates his guts?  His face right at that moment -- when he decided to go back -- that was great, that's what I like about Willis.  You'll see lots of cool faces like that in Die Hard too.
B00003CWPL|3.0|Okay, so if you've seen an actual print of this film, good for you.  Until a DVD comes out we're stuck with (...) bootlegs and bad sound.  To create some sort of median between the awful reviews and the great reviews I've given it an average review.  While Lynch has recently created his masterpiece in Mulholland Drive, 'Eraserhead' is a prime example of the art of filmmaking. Though it's mostly slow Lynch managed to spend five years of his life to create an atmosphere through prodecution design and sound he had set up the tone for his futre works.   So Eraserhead definitely stands out amongst other cult films it is not a masterpiece but does indeed give us a foreshadowing of Lynch as a filmmaker.  Plus, it gives serious Lynch fans something to look for consdiering it's so hard to find.

B00005R23Z|5.0|This movie seems to be saying something about the human spirit ... you know, that there's no gene for it.  It's giving us a message that genetic manipulation and cloning are bad, that the human spirit has nothing to do with science, and that human spirit is better than science.  But I love the idea of cloning.  And now we can clone people for real -- it's been done -- so why not take all the most capable people and clone them?  Eventually, if we keep cloning the best people and leave the others alone, we'll have a really cool world filled with really capable people.  But it seems the movie Gattaca doesn't want that at all.

I have never before read anything that drew such emotion out of me.  This came as a surprise because for the first 3/4 of the book I did not find myself too involved emotionally and then I suddenly could not put it down until I had finished every page.  I felt as though I was experiencing it myself and it was amazing.  This was a once-in-a-lifetime book experience and I can't wait for the motion picture!

The special edition is only about a dollar more.<br />   Otherwise, Dogma is a great film that should teach a lot of people to lighten up about religion. It's a very funny film with great performances by the entire cast. A lot of good points are made and I highly reccomend this for anyone.

B000002KKS|2.0|Face it,Ozzy is really not a great singer,he just has a sound,and that sound is as much Black Sabbath as Iommi's classic riffs,Butler's mighty bass fills , and Ward's thundering drums. While musically there are a lot of good things on this album. It's too much the Ronnie James Dio and his back-up band album.Another big part of Sabbath is that Terry &quot;Geezer&quot; Butler was always the band's lyricist until this album.This is really only about half a decent album,the second side seemed like a lot of filler and outtakes.Dehumanizer was their best with Dio because it wasn't so typical of the silly garbage that he has masqueraded as music for his whole career,and Butler sounds more interested on that album too.
0790737345|5.0|Excellent film ... very convinving performance by Meg Ryan. Definetly suggested to all. Extremely romatic.
0525946284|3.0|This is an excellent book of its genre, satisfying throughout and VERY well researched. Although other reviews castigate the author for imagining that women could successfully operate undercover in WWII France, the truth is that many did. <br />Follett has taken a real story and changed it enough for fictional uses, and the main characters are believable--except, perhaps, for their stunning looks. NO undercover agent has remarkable looks--the idea is to blend in, not stand out. And I DO quibble with the range of female stereotypes that make up the Jackdaws. Perhaps this is because the author is male, but I think it's more likely that he didn't wish to spend too much time fleshing them out. Yet the principal characters, and many of the secondary and tertiary, are firmly drawn and realized.<br />The plotting is generally deft and sure. Though the dramatic moments in the last third are predictable, given the requirements of the genre, Follett still manages to keep the tension high. I particularly like the anti-climax, regarding medals; all workers in a bureaucracy will recognize its realism.<br />As for the explicit torture routines--how can you write about Nazi interrogations and not include this, especially if you wish to convey what's at stake, personally, for the protagonists. Readers may not realize it, but Follett refrained from meticulously describing the horrific sights, smells, and sounds of such horrors.<br />In sum, a good, solid &quot;read&quot; worth the money.

B00005QDW1|3.0|I preface this review with the statement that No Doubt is my all-time favorite band.  I absolutely olve everything they have put out before this.  However, this CD is quite a change.  It's not that I don't like it, its that is is so different from every other record the band has released before.  This record is much more electronic and poplike than previous ones have been.  There's not nearly enough guitar.  The best moments of the album are when the bass is pumped up.  Unfortunately, the bass  guitar needs to be pumped up through all the songs, because with out it, they sound a bit weak.  Although its has some catchy tunes and some interesting arrangements, the entire album lacks a lot of the insight and eloquence lyrically that the last albums have expressed.  Some of lyrics border on shallow, making it hard to relate.  Being able to relate to Gwen was one of the reasons I fell in love with this band.  Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty good CD, which was why I gave it three stars.  SOmething just feels like its missing.  What I'm hoping is that It will grow on me as Return of Saturn did.  I do have to admit that the songs improved with a second istening and the title track of Rock Steady is awesome.  It's this fantastic funky sort of balld thing going on which is truly the highlight of the record.  In addition, Hella Good and Hey Baby have a great rhythm to them and sound better with each listen.  Also, I saw No DOubt open for U2 only a couple of weeks ago and they still retain the original sound I love live, the electronica is not performed.  Overall, the album is pretty cool.  I understand the process of an evolving sound.  Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn were two very different records.  However, in this record, No Doubt seems to have lost a little of their original, guitar driven,punk-ska essence that created their greatness.
B00005NB8J|3.0|Really enjoyed the movie, but if you hate letter boxing as I do,this one is not for you. I really hate to see a 32 inch screen look like a 20 and no other option .
B00005QG9J|5.0|I bought Incubus' new CD the day it came out and it hasn't left my stereo since.  Morning View is destined to become Incubus' second big hit in only a couple of years.  This album's music contains an awesome mixture of melodic guitar riffs powered by Boyd's roaring vocals.  The music surrounds you with great echos and makes you feel glad you have the ability to listen.  Their first hit single off of this album, &quot;I wish you were here&quot;, is only a glimpse of the excellent music that is to come from.  Great band, great music.  Keep it coming.

B000002J27|5.0|I love this album... it's definately the best Phil Collins Genesis album, because it is the same type of music, it's not pop... and yes, Phil Collins is a good singer... I'm listening to it now for the first time in ages, and I must say that the percussion is amazing... especially on Dance on a Volcano, and Los Endos... Phil Collins is definately one of the best drummers... also, this album is chock full of beautiful songs like Ripples, Mad Man Moon, and Entangled... anyways, if you like Peter Gabriel era Genesis, but are hesitent to pick this up because Phil Collins sings lead, well pick it up... If you're a fan of the Phil Collins Genesis, well definately pick this up, and then listen to some of the Gabriel genesis stuff for goodness sake!...
084428596X|5.0|I have been studying Norwegian for a long time, and Mr. Janus' book is one of the best I have found. It is easy to find answers to questions, and the verb list is amazingly complete and helpful. If you can't take an extended trip to Norway, and aren't blessed to live in Minnesota, then you should buy this book.
B00005AXEL|2.0|Like most of you, I am a Nicks fan and have all her solo work. I really like Street Angel, much more than this release. I listened to it once. Liked about three songs. Listened to it a few more times. Hmmmm. Not much sticks out. Sort of reminds me of Elton's WEST COAST album. All the press people yelp about a \\"return to form\\" and a \\"modern classic.\\" Hey, all we really want from these 50somethings is a good album. No great expectations. Well, this album is probably my least favorite. Like Elton, the hype machine went into gear. I listened, but this album isn't the classic we heard so much about. Also, I think we all know it--sales dropped off pretty fast and like Elton's latest, it wasn't the \\"hit\\" everyone thought it was going to be.
006097625X|5.0|I am not a comic book illustrator in particular, I'm a printmaker and an illustrator.  I got into sequential art in an informal sense, but since reading this book, I have a much better understanding of how to use the sequence to my advantage.  My awareness of the symbolism used in comics, and the techniques used to create understanding between reader and artist have increased immensely.  The book is not the answer to all your questions, it provides inspiration to continue creating art (not just comics), and a thoughtful plan on how to do so.
0312954468|5.0|Once I was about 15 pages into the novel I was completely hooked. the rest of the book flew by way too fast with exhilerating suspense and deep emotional triumphs. This novel had me chuckling at clever one liners and sobbing at herioc falls. It was purely a wild ride and worth every one of its 652 pages. This epic tale will definitely pull you into the world of the lovable genius Taita and the wonders of ancient Egypt. The only downside to this novel is that when it's over, you'll wish it wasn't.
B00003CXXR|4.0|Well my title says it all this movie contains lots of Lies.  For one the directors chose to put the t-rex in the first film (the t-rex was the largest and strongest carnivorr of all time) then they completly cut it from the 3 movie but with one exepction were the t-rex and the spionsaurs fight.  The t-rex was made alot smaller in that scene and it would have won in real life.  The fact that they took a dino  that was much smaller than the t-rex and almost doubled it's size is not that smart because the spinosaures only ate fish makeing it's body not muscluar at all.  If they were smart they would have started with the spinosuras and then the t-rex in the 3 movie.  However dispite that very very dumb scene this move was still pretty good.  Being a dino expert I loved these movies.  One this however they could have added to teh movie this is one of the shortest movies I have ever seen.  They oucld have sdded the best dino that got cut form this movie.  the diloposarus (bad spelling) but they were orinanally going to have it appere in this movie but cut it.  that had to be on eof the besst dino's that they cut along with that they added a red dino that the cast could have meet up with again.  However the ending kinda told you that they are going to make another jurassic park.  Aperently with a bigger dino that the t-rex and the oversized spinosaurs.  but overall this movie would have been alot beeter with out the t-rex and spion fighting and wth more of the t-rex in it ( I am sounding like a broken record) but there is somthing more scary about haveing this huge dino look at you and you are not suposed to move.  C'mon the t-rex was much scaryer  admit.  But at least the special effects were awsome!
B00005MNP8|5.0|Bazooka bubblegum topped with Debbie Harry's fetish sprinkles (&quot;I'm your dog, but not your pet&quot;), this concept album by one of the original Noo Yawk &quot;punk&quot; outfits (dig those skinny ties!) chronicles the rise and fall of an obsessive romantic crush, from those giddy first moments &quot;Hangin' on the Telephone&quot; to the arch dismissal of &quot;Just Go Away.&quot;  The remastered reissue includes two versions of &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; and a cover of T. Rex's dirty, sweet ode to a cat in black, &quot;Bang A Gong (Get It On)&quot; in addition to the icy sleekness of &quot;Sunday Girl,&quot; a Robert Fripp cameo on &quot;Fade Away And Radiate,&quot; and the still-ferocious-after-all-these-years stalker anthem, &quot;One Way or Another.&quot;
0553277472|4.0|This book taught me to &quot;pay attention when life goes awry.&quot; In some ways, this is a mysterious book because it is not so much fiction as it is the author's life. Not your average sort of book - it's wise, honest and solid. I also highly recommend &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom&quot; by Taro Gold. Excellent.
0440133688|5.0|Granted the book is exaggerated but I can find no book that catches the flavor of existential angst of internship as well as House of God does.  I go back to it (and the movie) like it is an old friend, the only one that truly understands what I go through daily as an attending physician.  Yes, folks, it doesn't get much better beyond internship!  There is a lot of denial amongst doctors which leads to alienation. Shem is probably one of the few who have given us the truth. Medicine is a hard path to take in life and much has changed since managed care took over.  I wish another Samuel Shem would come along to write a Revisited contemporary version of House of God in which the doctors are played by the patient's insurance representatives. They would go on daily rounds discussing how they can refuse every test, medication or procedure that their patient requests. In this revised House of God, the real doctors never see their patients because they have to spend all their time down in medical records filling out endless insurance forms and complying with federal regulations. Fatman would be very happy.
0064407667|1.0|A word which here means, an insult to the dictionary owning public.  What is with that?  Is it supposed to be funny?<BR>Anyway, that hurdle aside, it is an enjoyable read if you can ignore the rather silly plot contrivances.

B00003CX9S|5.0|This movie was so sad for me to watch that when I recently watched it on Television I had to change it during certain scenes.  However, that doesn't undermine the importance of this film and the strong messages that it offers.  This film is about accepting people who are different and that people should be judged by what's on the inside that counts.  This film teaches that true beauty is on the inside as William Hurt so powerfully demonstrates playing the tortured John Merrick.  John Merrick's meekness and innocence was powerfully portrayed by Hurt.  Some of the scenes are so beautiful yet sad that I had tears streaming down my face.  The one where Mr. Merrick meets the doctor's wife for the first time then breaks down because he says that he's never been treated so kindly by a beautiful woman before is one example that I can think of.  Heck, my eyes are watering up as I'm typing.  This movie should be seen by as many people as possible.
B0000041Z3|4.0|Save for the disappointments of the Fifth and Sixth, this Sibelius Cycle is the one to own.  And for those two symphonies, I recommend Maazel's second cycle, with the Pittsburgh Symphony.<br />These recordings are spacious, and well defined.  The remastering is a bit grainy, but the performance qualities overwhelm any worries about sound quality.<br />Maazel here conducts Sibelius with an urgency, with a rush, that I haven't heard anywhere else.  His sense for the architecture of Sibelius's symphonies is greater even than Berglund's, and his orchestra, the VPO, responds to his every whim like a well-trained gymnast.<br />One other reservation is the Second symphony, most people generally prefer a more &quot;Ormandy-esque&quot; approach, but for those looking for the music to have more impact than beauty, this recording will not disappoint.
0385421982|1.0|This book is by far the worse John Grisham book I have read (maybe tied with The Street Lawyer).  It is such a hand wringing liberal exercise that it almost becomes a farce.  All the Republicans are evil men who are in bed with big business.  All the lawyers are noble men/women full of ideas (except for the Republican law firm of course, they are scum).  The character of the president is such an aloof man that it is hard to see how such an idiot would be elected.  Of course, he must of had his wicked henchmen win the election for him.<br />All the characters in this book take on such cartoon qualities that it ruins the plot.  The man behind all the killings in the book becomes a James Bond type villian who starts killing everyone that gets in the way.  Does he think he would never get caught?<br />In summary:  all the unbelievable characters destroy the plot which is not that good to begin with.  The only thing good about this book is that it is short.  I am beginning to think that John Grisham may be the most overrated author around.  Don't read the Pelican Brief, stick to The Firm or The Rainmaker.
B00000F14B|4.0|The Music Man is a classic movie/musical.  It has everything you could want except violence, and that's not a bad thing.  Professor Hill wins over the town and falls in love with a woman who thinks she'll never marry.  Filled with music that leaves you singing long after the movie ends, this is a must buy for family viewing.
B00005R2BG|4.0|&quot;Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all, Love&quot;<br />The movie uses these four words as the slogan that is voiced throughout by its various characters, and to a certain extent, the film carries out a fulfillment of these principles. The spoofing of these principles come however with a constant repetition of them by the minor characters like John Legizamo's dwarf.<br />Elements of self-reflexivity govern the film to make us aware of its very nature as kitsch, and the film is not even ashamed of its nature as kitsch (or should I say &quot;Baz Luhrmann&quot; instead of &quot;the film&quot;?). This is highlighted many times through the repetition of motifs and lyrics from songs already well-known in American popular culture, which would include Madonna's &quot;Material Girl&quot;, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, Gloria Estefan's &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot;, Marilyn Monroe's &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot;, and Whitney Houston's &quot;I will always love you&quot;.<br />The self-conscious attempt to stage and produce a play(or drama) within the film itself, called &quot;The Spectacular Spectacular&quot;, adds to the elements of interest for an audience. Originally intending it to be staged in the backdrop of Switzerland, the characters change their mind and take a ludicrous turn for the worst, when they decide to change the setting of &quot;The Spectacular Spectacular&quot; to exotic India. The story of an evil and jealous old maharajah wanting to possess a beautiful woman for himself, and the hatred he bears towards a zither player in love with the woman, mirrors the love between Ewan McGregor's Christian and Nicole Kidman's Satine, which is foiled by the jealous affections of the Duke. Not to mention the least, the sequences of Hindi song and dance are pivotal to illustrating the darker passions unfolding between these characters.<br />Next to the adaptation of Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, this is undoubtedly the reel event event of theyear. Soap melodrama lovers can look forward to bringing their tissues to the theater, while lovers of pop tunes and Broadway alike will find a reason to flock to it.
B00003CWTH|3.0|This movie has a lot of depth. It also tries to do too much with itself. My wife couldn't stand it and thought it was a very long waste of her time. I'm not so sure.<br /> Each character is interesting. Each one is written well. Each one with one exception has a mouth on him or her. We have a chronicle of dysfunctional characters doing wrong and dysfunctional things. About half way through the picture I had the oddest feeling that there was a happy ending waiting for me.<br /> Since it is such a counter culture picture and the culture of the last 20 years celebrates all that is dysfunctional a counter culture picture can only be one of confidence and redemption and happy endings. We see that here.<br /> I'm sure PETA had a fit at the end of this picture. I also think that it could have achieved its ends without the stunt. It had the virtue of being totally unexpected and so irrational that it shocks people to reality (Sept 11th).<br /> Then again it could just be a cheep stunt for some guys who couldn't figure out how to get from a-b. Either way you'll find the performances all very good particularly by the supporting cast. (Three cheers for Henry Gibson who has more depth than anybody gives him credit) and if nothing else this movie will DEFINATELY give you something to talk about.
B00005QIPH|1.0|(...)  This guys have nothing but distortion pulsing through the vocals, lame and unoriginal riffs, and just plain blah tempos and beats.  <br />Its like the Beatles, Rancid, Velvet Underground and Billy Joel all put into one blender to make on disgusting horrific sound.<br />The only thing these guys are the saviours of is bad music.<br />(...)
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Having waited too long to get the DVD, my kids launched it and loved it. There's humor and a story for both the young and the old.

B00003CXE6|5.0|Gladiator has to be one of the best movies in a long time. The acting was fantastic. I particularly enjoyed New Zealander Russell Crowe in the role of Maximus, Connie Nielson as Lucilla, and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. The story was fast paced, gripping and moving, and the portrayal of the Roman Empire and its people was magnificent. The gladiatorial scenes were stunningly realistic, although extremely gory and shocking. <BR>This movie fully deserved the Oscars it won. Anyone 13 and over will most definately be entertained.
B00004Z459|5.0|If you're interested in buying a hard rock CD with decent lyrics, I strongly suggest you buy this one!<BR>The first time I heard One Step Closer, one of the albums singles, I was imeadiately hooked! The lyrics are worth taking the time to listen to.  Unlike most rock songs they are understandable, and the writer clearly was not afraid to reveal his true emotions.<BR>At first I was a little thrown off by the screaming that goes on in most of their songs, but after listening to the CD a few times, it's pretty obvious that the whole shouting thing contributes to a major part of the music.<BR>If you're looking for a mix of hard rock/rap, order Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory, I guarentee you'll love it!
0446677450|4.0|While Kiyosaki is Mark Twain and his stories may be repetitive between the lines of this book is gold.  There are lessons in this book that I would have never learned else were, because most people who understand the concept of &quot;making monaye work for you&quot; don't generally share or have the audience.  It is essential that one reads this book before making future finacial decisions.  Kiyosaki found a simple way to explain essential skills in finacail magement.  It takes concepts you have heard and explains how they can work in your life.  Everyone knows that you shoudl't purchase with credit, this book explains how through biulding your assets, that eventually there isno need for loans and debt.  Kiyosaki has brilliantly sparked my interest and will do the same for you.  This book will make money for by showing a different way to make money and have it work for you.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt took five years to follow up Tragic Kingdom with Return Of Saturn, but they quickly turn around a year and half later with Rock Steady.  Unlike their previous two albums, which were heavily weighted with emotional based songs like &quot;Don't Speak&quot; and &quot;Simple Kind Of Life&quot;, Rock Steady is a good time party record.  The band moves back to their earlier days with a heavier ska/reggae sound throughout the album, eschewing most rock sounds. There are liberal doses of 80's arcade game sound effects (pinging and popping effects) sprinkled through songs.  Gwen Stefani is playing up the homegirl image she put forth on the big hit &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot; she had with Eve.  Songs like &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Making Out&quot;, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and the first single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; all find her working the sex kitten angle.  &quot;Running&quot; is the lone ballad on the album and it is a gorgeous song and one of their strongest.  Former Cars leader Ric Ocesak produces two songs on the album including the superb &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; while the band traveled to Paisley Park Studios and recorded with the Purple One himself, Prince, on the sultry &quot;Waiting Room&quot;.  Several other producers including Sly &amp; Robbie, Nelle Cooper and William Orbit (most famous for Madonna's Ray Of Light album) produce tracks, but the album has a uniform sound despite this hodgepodge production approach.  No Doubt has become famous for their turmoils, but they finally seem to have exorcised their personal demons and are letting loose and having fun.  Rock Steady isn't as good as Tragic Kingdom, but it's got a great party vibe.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Not only did Britny Spears come up with her new self titled album but she came up with a whole new Britney.  ... but she is taking on a whole new image. Her entire album basically screams out &quot;Hey world! I'm grown up now, deal with it!&quot; The new album is extremely upbeat, it molds together pop, soul, and rock-&amp;-roll to make Britney's new style. The lyrics speak out to older teenage girls who deal with similar situations Britney experienced as a teen. Miss Spears got her point through while snatching the spotlight on this one. Yes Britney, we have realized that you are &quot;not a girl but not yet a woman.&quot;ected&quot; and &quot;Whatit's Like to be Me&quot; make this cd worthwhile and may actually help Britney break from that teen-pop thing...maybe not, what do I know?  I do know this cd is the best work I've heard from her and I have some respect forming for the girl.  Oh yeah, anyone who can sing a song with lyrics like &quot;Bombastic love, it's a fantastic love&quot; and make it sound even the slightest bit fun and not hoaky...that's a talent in it's own.
B00000K3D4|5.0|From the moment I saw this movie I was hooked. Jim Henson did a wonderful job directing, the writing is terrific and the actors did an excellent job. However, the best parts of this movie are the musical interludes. They were beautifully done and the music alone could make the movie worth seeing. I suggest this movie to anyone that loves a good fantasy or to anyone that loves David Bowie:)
B0000039QP|5.0|Once again the Notorious B.I.G. proves he is a rap icon.  His previous album had rap fans everywhere captivated and hungry for more--he satisfied us with the release of Life After Death.  Notorious B.I.G.s undeniable talent combined with smooth beats makes this a CD you cannot listen to without wanting to throw your hands in the air and do your best C-walk.  Rather than focusing on his hard street life, he uses this album to tell about his rich and exotic life now.  He also expands his horizons by working with other artists including Jay-Z, Lil Kim, R. Kelly, and the Lox.
0790744295|3.0|Very funny horror flick which contains 5 tales of horror.  All of them were pretty interesting except for father's day, which was waiting to absolutely stink.  I dont know if I blame his daughter ( you have to watch it to understand what I am talking about). My favorite was the 5th story They are Creeping on You, where this wealthy penthouse owner pays the price with bugs.  He got tore off something awful.  Anyway check this film out if you never seen it.  It will give you the creeps.......a little anyway.
B00005MG2Y|5.0|well, HT alone was great, now two more songs? Cool. Now, i may get flak for being a purist or such, but i appreciate that Link Park doesnt use explicit lyrics. I mean, I listen to bad lyriced music but it is refreshing Linkin Park is keeping clean, swares are ok but the world doesnt need them and I think Linkin Park is doing a great job without them, they rock. Glad Linkin Park stayed clean, keep it up! Great album.
6302824729|5.0|This sequel was wonderful. I liked how Daniel grows more as a person by the new people he meets, learning different customs and most of all...the way he handles himself in the end! <BR>The creator of this movie did a great job of creating a spin off to the first movie. I think that this movie should have been where it all ended. I liked the music selection, the action, and the beautiful surroundings of the quaint little village where they stayed. I recommend!
B000002J1M|5.0|_Foxtrot_ is simply one of the finest albums in classic progressive rock, or in \\"any\\" kind of rock, period, and it's brilliance and freshness do not seem to go stale, even after all these years. As with most complex music, it deserves quite a few listens before making a final judgement.<br /><br />It starts off with the atmospherical rocker, \\"Watcher Of The Skies,\\" with it's lush, dramatic mellotron splashes, and the quirky rhythm in 6. \\"Time Table\\" is probably the only subdued piece on the album, but loaded with lots of melody and charm. \\"Get 'Em Out by Friday\\", is almost like a mini-play, as it is presented in a character/line format, and the music on here is quirky and complex. \\"Can-Utility and the Coastliners\\", is another complex tune, with many shifts in melody and dynamics. Splendid stuff. \\"Horizons\\", is a short, classical-like guitar piece, which gets you ready for the big one: \\"Supper's Ready.\\" This is the 23-minute epic divided into seven sections. The first four take up the first 11 minutes. The last three sections in my opinion are the strongest, but make no mistake, this piece is solid throughout, and in some ways, is like listening to a drama set to music. Willow Farm, features Peter Gabriel's manic humor (Winston Churchill was probably spinning in his grave due to the somewhat provocative lyrics.) Apocalypse in 9/8, appropriately, is mostly in 9/8, and features Tony Banks' organ playing, which is unbelievable and takes the spotlight in this movement. Also, listen to Phil Collins' virtuosic drumming, and how he handles the tricky rhythms. It's something to behold.<br /><br />This is *excellent* progressive rock that truly stands the test of time; the kind of album that will reveal more subtle nuances the more it is listened to. If you want something esoteric, quirky, complex and daring, this is a great purchase.
B00000490M|5.0|This is another all time favorite. Daniel is an inspriation in this movie. He goes from living in a new place, being the underdog to being &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;<BR>I like how he doesn't give up and keeps fighting to get to his goal. He learns the art of Karate by his wise and caring teacher.<BR>He not only wins the fighting match, but he wins the girl too! <BR>This movie will always hold a special place in my memories.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Ben saves the world!<BR>Market Researchers go into overdrive (...)<BR>Add Benny boy for the chick flickers, and some bomb effects for the dudes who come along on the date.<BR>Mix in a heap of syrup and you have it!<BR>After the AOL CD's that litter this land, this DVD is the greatest waste of plastic and non-recyclables on this planet!<BR>I think that maybe the little seen (deservedly) flick called, \\"Gone Fishin'\\" was the latter day sequel to this one. Or is \\"Pearl Harbour\\" really the prequel to Danny Glover's vehicle of shame, \\"Gone Fishin'\\"??<BR>Only time will tell if Benny boy ends up as a rug-wearing barrel like Burt Reynolds evolved into. One can only hope.... :)
B00005Q45W|5.0|It's still him. He hasn't changed too much, or gone off in some weird direction. It's classic studio LC. If you love him, loved The Future, or I'm Your Man, buy it now.
B000006TRV|3.0|There are two main schools of thought about &quot;The Wall&quot;.  One school decrees that it is an adolescent, paranoid, tiring piece of self-indulgent rubbish.  The other declares that it is a wonderful demonstration of the importance of freedom and growth (sort of the musical version of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; or &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;).  As with many questions, the answer lies somewhere in the middle.<BR>    &quot;The Wall&quot; has its share of good songs.  &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part II&quot;, while musically rudimentary, has wonderful lyrics.  I don't think Waters is railing against education here; just the school's apparent inability to provide it.  &quot;Mother&quot; is nice, both musically and lyrically.  The other two &quot;Another Brick&quot;s are OK.  &quot;Waiting for the Worms&quot; is nicely chilling.<BR>    This is all dragged down by things like &quot;The Trial&quot; (The prisoner who now stands before you/Was caught red handed showing feelings/Showing feelings of an almost human nature/This will not do) which are self-indulgent, whiny, and trite.  Add to that the fact that the music comes nowhere near the level of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (which was a triumph primarily because of its music) and you have a bit of a mixed bag.  Thirty dollars is too much for a mixed bag.<BR>    The album's closer, &quot;Outside the Wall&quot;, I've always liked.  It gives one the sense of something epic and wonderful ending, as &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; did with Sgt. Pepper's.<BR>    It is only after a while that one realizes that there wasn't anything epic and wonderful there at all.
0064407667|1.0|I didn't like this book because too much of it did not<br />make sense.  Right after their house burns down and<br />their parents die, the three kids are officially placed<br />in a totally  filthy home with only one bed and no crib<br />for the baby?  That wouldn't happen.<br />The baby was hung from a bird cage<br />out the window?  How did they feed her?  No one<br />changed her diapers?  and especially:<br />The judge said the marriage was legal?  No way.  Violet<br />was tricked into marrying Count Olaf, so it was<br />a marriage under false pretenses so it would not<br />really count.  I thought this was kind of a dumb book<br />and I won't read any more books in this series.<br />The only parts I liked were the parts about Violet being a good inventor.
B000001EAQ|4.0|When this album was released, the public opinion was polarized.  Critics were basically split between loving it and hating it.  Many longtime U2 fans were scared off by the &quot;techno&quot; label and had given up hope for U2.  Well let me give my honest opinion and set a few things straight.<br />First off, Pop is definitely not techno.  It may have some electronic dance elements thrown in, but it is not very danceable.  The only track that comes close to full-blown techno is &quot;MOFO&quot;.  This is a rock and roll record with real songs--I wouldn't buy it if it wasn't.  I admit I was hesitant to buy Pop because I heard all the hype about U2-goes-techno, but I got it and was pleasantly surprised.  Pop is not a &quot;pop&quot; album; it is a rock record that is difficult to understand, but very rewarding if you do.<br />There are plenty of good songs.  The tripped-out rocker &quot;Discotheque&quot; leads the way, with a deadly catchy guitar riff played by U2's resident genius, The Edge.  &quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot; is another good tune with great guitar and bass playing. &quot;MOFO&quot; is one of the most startling tracks U2 ever recorded, because it is rampaging and quite disturbing at times.  That song is followed by the lovely &quot;If God Would Send His Angels,&quot; a plaintive plea to God with some of Bono's best singing on the album.  It is the first in a handfull of EXCELLENT songs--&quot;Staring at the Sun,&quot; &quot;Last Night On Earth,&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot; are all fantastic songs with clever lyrics and catchy-but-not-corny melodies.  The next two songs, &quot;Miami&quot; and &quot;The Playboy Mansion,&quot; are the only songs on Pop I don't like; they cost an otherwise outstanding album a fifth star.  However, U2 justify themselves on the chills-up-your-spine &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress,&quot; the melancholy &quot;Please,&quot; and the pleading &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;.  <br />Overall, this a solid album from a band with very high standards.  The only drawbacks are the one or two sub-par songs and the occasionally poor production.  However, if you don't close your ears before listening, you might be surprised how much you like it.  It is not a bad album at all!
B00003CXTF|1.0|The worst movie of the year, and maybe one of the worse movies ever. Terribly written, trite, almost insulting to the movie goer. Whoever wrote this should be flogged.  Only redeeming quality: battle scene.
B00004XQ83|4.0|This is like old American music style..<BR>But the songs are fresh. <BR>Try listen once.
B00004Z459|5.0|The name of the CD being reviewed is \\"Hybrid Theory\\". The name of the band that made the CD is \\"Lincoln Park\\". The release date was 2000, and the production company is Warner Brothers. I gave the CD five stars, since I listen to it all the time now. My standards are how good the lead singer sounds, how the music feels to me and how it makes me feel, and how many good songs (songs that I will listen to more than once without feeling annoyed) there are on the CD. <BR>       I loved this CD. It makes me feel good. It relates to my life perfectly. The way that the music on this CD screams out at you, the way the beats all roll on with the lead singers voice, the way it flows perfectly while talking about things that happen in everyday life; the pain, the sorrow, the confusion, the depression, all wrapped up into a tight little ball of feeling. There are only two songs on the whole CD that aren't exceptional, and even they don't annoy me. This is a good thing since the CD is short. It is definitely worth every one of the five stars, and is one of my favorite CD's.
B00005BCK6|4.0|Another pairing of great if mismatched episodes.  I guess the idea was to pool dissimilar episodes rather than the episodes which seem like slight variations on a single idea (like sending the crew to planets ruled by modern day versions of Nazi Germany or Imperial Rome).<br />In \\"A Piece of the Action\\", the crew journeys to Iotia, a planet whose inhabitants prove incredibly resourceful and adaptive.  Based upon a single book on 1920's Gangsters left behind by a previous starship, the Iotians have modeled their entire culture to resemble Jazz-era Chicago - Tommyguns, mob-molls, hits and all.  Landing on Iotia to open contact, Kirk and crew find themselves in the middle of a gang war.  The episode is funny without being too campy (forgetting that this is the story requiring the heroes to sneak around a Paramount backlot in period costume).  Kirk struggles to unite the warring gangs for the good of the planet without taking sides and without becoming another hit.  The last shot is classic - leaving open the possibility that the Iotians may one day demand a piece of the Starfleet's action.<br />In \\"By any other name\\", the Enterprise is hijacked by the Kelvan - an advanced race of beings from the Andromeda galaxy.  Having been marooned when their ship was crippled by the energy barrier at the rim of our galaxy (the same barrier that has made appearances in \\"Where no man has gone before\\", \\"Is there no truth in Beauty\\" and the fifth Trek film), the Kelvan took on the shape of human beings.  Their actual forms - immense being with many tentacles and huge brains - would have trouble managing turbolifts.  Once past the barrier, the Kelvan use their advance technology to reduce much of the crew into small styrofoam boxes, and otherwise keep the remaining crew in submission.  Their mission is to reach their home galaxy and return to ours with a massive invasion force.  This is a great episode, combining some subtle wit and quick thinking with some matchless direction.  In oneexcellent cut, Scott, Spock and Kirk weigh their options enroute to the bridge.  With the Kelvan homecoming a possible harbinger of invasion, the crew realizes that more than their own lives are stake.  Yet, against the Kelvan technology, only a single plan is available and suicidal at that.  \\"The Kelvan will be stopped here\\", Spock intones gravely \\"and so will we.\\"  Kirk is about to respond in fury - there's got to be something else we can do - when the door opens.  None of the nex-gen episodes can touch that moment.  Get this DVD.
B000006NUW|5.0|I have this collection on tape and am buying it on CD to insure that I will always have it.  I listen to it over and over, never getting tired of hearing the selections.  Hitsville 1959-1971 is absolutely the BEST oldies collection made.  Thank you to Barry Gordy, these wonderful classics are preserved forever.
B00004THAY|5.0|BB KING GETS BETTER WITH AGE.IF YOU DONT OWN RIDING WITH THE KING YOU SHOULD.
0783225857|5.0|This film has such an evocative title sequence we're amazed to learn that Saul Bass didn't do it. It almost threatens to overpower the film, as the Bass titles for \\"A Walk on the Wild Side\\" primed us for something that film did not deliver. \\"Mockingbird\\" begins delivering in narrative, performance and craftsmanship soon enough, and it does so in beautiful black-and-white cinematography stunningly restored in this DVD transfer.     It also delivers a small emotional wallop following the black man's rape trial, when his white attorney (Gregory Peck) leaves a courtroom in defeat and empty save for the blacks packed into the upper gallery. As they rise to their feet, one says to the little girl beside him, \\"Stand up, child, your father's leaving the coutroom.\\" Their tribute to the white man who defended a black one in a losing cause is unexpectedly moving. That could be said for the film itself.
B000002P5R|3.0|Anyone expecting a greatest hits or a whole album won't find it here.These songs are scattered,mostly experimental works.It is a great shame that THE man never had a chance to fully flesh out these new ideas and take his music to a different level.The best of the collection are &quot;Angel&quot;,&quot;Dolly Dagger&quot;,&quot;Freedom&quot;,&quot;Drifting&quot; and the quirky &quot;Belly button window&quot;.These songs alone make the disc worth having,and they leave you wondering what might have been.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Rather than create a legitimate action/adventure film, Simon West gave movie-goers the softest form of porn available.  Why is there a shower scene in there?  Is he selling shampoo?  <br />I think the same pre-teen gameboy nerdboys that go to see this movie were actually the same people the made the movie.  Could they never get enough of watching silicone jiggling?  \\"Hey guys, let's put another slow-motion running shot of Angelina running into the camera.\\"  I bet they're working on the Tomb Raider swimsuit edition right now.<br />To everyone who bought this DVD... do us a big favor and place it under a nice fat elephant (...).  That's where you'll find Simon West working up his next big hit.
6305603847|5.0|The Wall is a great movie about the pink floyd bassist and leader (at that time) Roger Waters. It's a non-linear movie, really hard to understand, full of metaphors. It was made in the 70's and it discusses lots of actual themes. The only problem of this movie is that it's too much non-commercial, what makes lots of people to not like it... <br />It's like nothing i've ever seen. It's an album made to be a movie and a movie made to be an album; by that you can imagine the sync between images and sounds. <br />The treatment of the images is really damn good. The contents of the DVD is really amazing too. Of course, for those who like Pink Floyd, the dvd is even better. <br />It's really worth to spend the money.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out in September, and it is still my favorite CD 3 months later.  There is something about this CD that takes you back in time.  You feel like you are walking the streets of New York in 1979 when glam and fast, loud rock was all the rage.  Lets just say you need to buy this CD as soon as possible.  This is only their first Cd and The Strokes are going to only get better.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|The CD Escape I found to be entertaining. It is a CD I would enjoy listening to on a regular basis. The lyrics to the songs in Escape are very romantic, and the music goes from slow and romantic to more upbeat rhythms. Its one of those CDs you could sit down and listen to or get up and dance to. Although Enrique Iglesias may not have the best vocals, the passion he sings with enables the listener to focus more on the lyrics because they're sang with great meaning. This CD also provides the listener a taste of spanish lyrics, that anyone including the non spanish speaker, can listen to and enjoy.
B00005B36H|4.0|the best thing in 2001......wait a second, there something else out there. i can't believe it, somebody other than Tool made a special album. and they're called System of a Down: it seems another band actually puts some thought into their music. if all is true about Lallapoloooza returning. I just found your co-headliners. I'm out

When I was done reading I couldn't stop thinking about it and now I have a whole new view of the world around me.  This is a must read.

B000021YQV|4.0|This cd and this band are both the only things I respect in all nu metal, the rest is a terrible joke , however this band is awesome , their music concept is really diferent from the others and the lirycs are inteligent, the mix between agressive vocals , some good guitar riffs and some melodic parts all at once makes this record a memorable surprise, in a kind of ''metal'' that the bad taste is what rulez..., System Of A Down is the ONLY great one in nu metal.
B00005RFAI|5.0|WOOOOWWWW!!.  This CD is definitely Grammy material.  It's a 5+++++. (...)  What makes this CD so spectacular is the diversity of music.  She provides her fans with a tasteful range of pop, rock, R&B, Blues, with just a little bit of jazz.  I am a huge music fan & appreciate all types of music including pop, soft/classic rock, R&B, Blues, Jazz, classical, etc.  Many critics classify this CD as hard rock.  I dissagree.  Yes, there are 4-5 tracks (Don't Let Me Get Me, Just Like a Pill, 18 Wheeler, Misery (blues/rock), Numb) that are considered rock, but they are more in the lines of just rock not hard rock like so many refer to it as.  And even though these \\"rock\\" songs are considered rock - they are awesome.  If your not a \\"hard rock/rock\\" fan you will still loooove these songs.  There is something about the music and sound that is sooo unique. Her powerful lyrics are so full of emotion and really allows fans to relate.<BR>\\"Missundaztood\\", track 1 - more of a pop song, but there are alot of people who are simply \\"missundaztood\\" (like those who would dare think to diss this CD).<BR>Females can really relate to \\"Respect\\" track 5 - most of us have had to brush off those disrespectful (...) men that are only looking for one thing - you know, like at the clubs.<BR>\\"Family Portrait\\" track 7 is filled with emotional lyrics & those of us who have experienced family divorce of disfunction can totally relate.<BR>\\"Misery\\" track 8 is real soulful with a mixture of blues and rock.<BR>\\"Dear Diary\\" unique funky sound.<BR>\\"Eventually\\" track 10 - Her sharp, clever, and witty lyrics send out a clear message to those in her past who dissed her - well, she says \\"Eventually, you'll get yours\\".<BR>\\"Lonely Girl\\" - soulful and filled with her personal emotions.<BR>\\"Numb\\" track 12 - you go girl.  She rocks in this song.  A message goes out to all those bad guys who think they can screw around with are heads.<BR>\\"Gone to California\\" - She takes you on a ride while she seeks her own personal freedom.<BR>\\"My Vietnam\\" track 14 - Awesome<BR>One of my favorites is \\"18 Wheeler\\" track 6 - Sends a message to those bad guys who think they can \\"run over us with their 18 Wheeler Trucks, but we just get back up\\".  \\"No, No, you can't get us down, we'll get right back up\\".  A strong message sent out to all those woman who have been beaten down.  Just get write back up.  Don't let'em get you down.<BR>Although it is very difficult to choose your favorite song because they are all so good I like the sound in Dear Diary.<BR>I am just in ahhhhhhh over this CD.  Outstanding work Pink.  You rock.  Can't wait until your next musical masterpiece.  You so well deserve a Grammy.  GREAT JOB.  Buy this CD - you will not be dissapointed.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Before you even attemt to watch this movie you need to have a few hours in your day reserved. PEARL HARBOR is a very LONG film. Plus the bonus features make it even longer. Ok, all of that being said, it's actually a pretty good movie. It was a bit boring at the beginning but it quickly got interesting. The visuals in PEARL HARBOR are amazing! The special effects are awesome. The extreme close-ups give you the feeling of being right there in some scenes. PEARL HARBOR stars Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. Ben plays Raphe and  Josh plays Danny. The acting was pretty good. PEARL HARBOR also contains an underlining love story in it's plot which adds some emotion to it. It's a movie with everything included. You've got action, awesome special effects, romance, drama, all rolled into one. The bonus material on PEARL HARBOR is good too. There's behind the scences stuff and even the Faith Hill music  video for &quot;there you'll be&quot;. If you can stand the length, PEARL HARBOR is worth checking out.
B00003CX9S|1.0|I love this movie.  I've been anxiously waiting for it to be released on DVD, and when it finally arrived, I was very disappointed!<br />This is a Paramount release.  Paramount is notorious for releasing movies at premium prices with very little extras.  This release was no exception.<br />Oh, there was the usual trailer, and a couple of other extras.  But, there was no booklet.  The booklets usually contain the chapter listings, correct?  Well, guess what, THERE ARE NO CHAPTERS TO SELECT!!  This DVD plays straight, without scene access like a video cassette!!<br />If you are a fan of the movie, like I am, don't be suckered into buying this version.  Buy it used.<br />As for Paramount, you've conned me for the last time.  This is my last Paramount DVD purchase.
1878424319|1.0|I can see how shelf space is so valuable to Authors and Publishers.  I was feeling like a bit of a pick me up and although I have not finished the book I am hoping to still retrieve some valuable information from it.  When a book is plastered all over the book store you believe it has something to say.  So far I have learned that your parents play a significant role in your value system, the religion that you are initially exposed to, and your name!  And it took several pages to reiterate that.  I do not look forward to going back to it but perhaps I will walk away with a bit of insight by the time I close the book?
0385335482|5.0|This book was the funnest book I have ever read in my entire life~! When I first saw this book in the bookstore, it caught my attention immediately and thus I decided to buy it. Was that smart~! Once I read the first few lines I knew that I was going to love this book. Once you start you can't stop. Seriously~! Sohpie Kinsella is such a brilliant writer and the book literally brightens up your day. It's packed with some hilarious stuff and at times I just had to call up my best friend to read her some excerpts from the book~ I recommend this book to anybody who wants a good laugh...actually I recommend this book to EVERYBODY whether you want a good laugh or not~!!!!
0316776963|1.0|There was nothing to laugh about in this book.  The author made it clear he had a terrible life, that he hated everything and everyone, and that he has felt unloved throughout his life.  I found the book to be depressing, irritating and frustrating.
0385505833|3.0|It doesn't take very much imagination to ascertain the inspiration for John Grisham's latest title, \\"Skipping Christmas\\". Stores and malls that grow more crowded and less customer friendly as the final days before Christmas approach. The annual traditions that attempt to lull family and friends into forgetting budgets and credit card limits. The frenzy of swarming mobs at half price sales and lay-away counters. Time spent decorating homes, demonstrating Christmas spirit with twinkling lights and sparkling icicles. The holidays!... the season of giving and giving and giving, sometimes excessively.<br />John Grisham introduces the reader to Luther and Nora Krank, an average couple living on an average street in an average town during the average Christmas season. This year, though... the couple have agreed to a different kind of holiday. This year, the first year that their only child, Blair, will be away from home for Christmas, the Kranks have tallied up the total cost of their previous Christmas' and decided that they're going to do things differently. Just this one year, with Blair away, Luther and Nora are \\"Skipping Christmas\\" and using the money they'll save for a special vacation. They plan to leave Christmas Day for their dream cruise.<br />Their personal agreement with each other restricts either from spending anything on Christmas. No cards, gifts, donations, not a penny on the usual Christmas' expenses. As the big day nears, the Kranks are reminded and challenged over and over by neighbors, friends and associates... everywhere they go, everyone they know, seems to be opposing their decision. Skipping Christmas!!! Scrooge!!!... become the methodical chants from everyone they meet. Resisting pressure from their friends and neighbors, despite becoming the focus of so much negative attention, Luther and Nora stay stubbornly devoted to their decision to skip Christmas.<br />Finally, the big day is near... one more day and they'll be on that cruise, away from all the accusations incriminating them as modern day \\"Scrooge's\\", away on that dream cruise they've been anticipating.... and then something happens. One short phone call changes their plans and, in due time, conveys the true meaning of Christmas to them all.<br />Skipping Christmas is short and sweet [with only 177 pages] but couldn't be described as anything special. It's a neatly contrived approach to the frustration and anxiety behind all the holiday joy. It portrays all the questionably materialistic concepts and financially draining motives that encompass the season of good cheer and touches upon many of the same suspicions and disillusions we've all undoubtedly pondered. It's a nice, recognizable story... yet it fails to fulfill it's duty to the reader.<br />Where other Christmas tales - It's A Wonderful Life, The Christmas Box and Scrooge, to name a few - send a valuable message without becoming preachy or stale, \\"Skipping Christmas\\" simply doesn't compare. Skipping Christmas didn't reveal anything new... no new insights or sincerities. Nothing to make me feel that Grisham has genuine wisdom to offer here. It's warmed-over plot and aseptic characters that I couldn't identify with or even compare to someone I know. The premise of materialism during the holidays is a well-known fact that nearly everyone has dealt with, the main reason it doesn't work well... it doesn't divulge any secrets or express any uniqueness. The story scantily represents the season or the author in a way that could be considered memorable.<br />Skipping Christmas is a decent story. Unlike John Grisham's other tales - A Painted House, The Brethren, The Testament, The Street Lawyer, The Partner, The Runaway Jury, The Rainmaker, The Chamber, The Client, The Pelican Brief, The Firm and A Time To Kill... Skipping Christmas isn't a story I would read again and again. It didn't open up any new windows or spark any new wisdom.<br />As far as recommending this one, I would suggest reading SkippingChristmas for yourself if you're a John Grisham fan. You might discover aspects of the story that I've failed to. For those who've never read John Grisham's other work though, I would suggest reading one of his other books. This one fails to do the author justice.ipping Christmas for yourself if you're a John Grisham fan. You might discover aspects of the story that I've failed to.

B00004Y9PP|5.0|Another awesome movie. I feel no need to express myself again, so go check out Event Horizon, and read my review there. If you're too lazy to do that, then take my advice. Just see it. Don't question, just go see the movie.
B0000027RL|5.0|Okay, if you like Pearl Jam, and don't have this CD, you need to!  It is so good, and you can listen to it all the way through without getting sick of it!  I don't have favorite songs on it, because they are all equally great.  Even if you aren't  a fan, you should get this album because it will turn you into one.  All Pearl Jam's other albums are awesome too, they are just a great group!
B00004Z459|4.0|No bass player. Not a Nirvana. Not real music. These guys won't be around in twenty years. Whatever!! Just a few bad comments from other reviews, but just listen to the CD and YOU be the judge. I know when I did, I wound up listening to the whole thing and I scooped it up. I'm just a music fan who liked what he heard and these guys are good. If you liked their single In The End, then you'll enjoy the rest of the cuts on the disc. The guitars rock, the drums/tracks are slammin'(tight production), and then they threw in some cool rhyme verses with no profanity. That was a strong selling point as I didn't have to go hunt all over town for an edited version of this CD. Trust the other 600 or so positive reviews and your listening ear and add this one to your collection. Besides, holding a 4.5 out of 5.0 star rating over 600 reviews and going multi platinum means somebody's diggin' this CD. Don't miss out!
B00005QHSS|5.0|I just recieved my copy of the Mutter: Limited Tour Edition CD.  IT ROCKS!!  I tried ordering it from CDNOW.com. ...  I waited for a month for it to get out of backorder, which it never did, so I came to Amazon and got it within a week of ordering it.    The packaging for this CD is simply wonderful.  It's stunning looks are a great addition to anyone's CD collection.  The red artwork as opposed to the original green tint is also really cool.  One nice addition to the set is the small booklet that accompanies the bonus second disc.  The book is similar to the original Mutter's book, but features a picture of each band member in action during a concert as opposed to the \\"dead-body-in-formaldahyde\\" look.    The four live tracks on the second disc are simply AWESOME!  The songs are performed with as much enthusiasm and energy as any of the songs on \\"Live Aus Berlin\\".  \\"Ich Will\\"  is chock full of energy and awesome guitars, as are the other three songs.  Great music and great sound effects.   I don't even need to mention the superior quality of the songs on the actual album \\"Mutter\\".  Great Stuff.   This CD is worth the price, and is a great addition to any true Rammstein fan's collection.  Buy it while you still can!
B000003TAL|5.0|When it comes to a majority of punk music, what you essentially get is more of the same--wild youths yelping about destruction and juevenile attempts at being vulgar. What essentially made Sonic Youth better on this album? It's hard to tell, but they seemed to tackle the trite themes of anarchy and confusion with more poetic sensibilities, and ofcourse they were one of the first to bring a form of jazz into the punk equation...After each song told its cut-up tale, all the while caroling through the fascinatingly endless worlds of chaos, they went off into edgy guitar indulgences which are more of psychadelic journeys than soloes. Basically, what we are left off with is a spazmodic, continually flowing masterpeice that took alternative rock to a brave new level...a simple statement of freedom and punk values that was not the same old thing, it was almost like the beat generation had learned to play guitars.<br />It's hard to pick out any one song, because while each have different lyrics, they all seem to reflect the free themes mentioned above. It starts out with the ripping pinnacle of protest and sonic youthfulness which is &quot;Teen Age Riot&quot;, stays zooming and vital until it crashes into a quiet confusion with &quot;Providence&quot;, then picks itself up again and keeps racing through a fragmented existence right into the epic &quot;Trilogy&quot; with the rush of &quot;Poor boy, Rich boy, Poor/Rich boy coming right through me!&quot;. A collage of senses, the good and the bad vibes, all of that wonderful stuff. An important inclusion in the Sonic Youth experience.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Once you see the film, you will insist on having the soundtrack.
B00005B3Z6|3.0|I also have the privilege of being able to watch the TRUE original version from the UK.  Whilst, in essence, this is indeed the same series, I have noticed that the Canadian/US version does not have the original soundtrack and has deleted some of the scenes for content.  This was truly disappointing.  My personal recommendation would be to order the UK DVD and have it converted over to US DVD for around US$30 or have it converted to VHS for US$10.  It's well worth the expense.  Believe me.
B00003CXXS|4.0|This is my least favorite of the Jurassic Park films.  Story line could have been better &amp; they needed a &quot;female&quot; character in the film, not the one pretending to be an exwife &amp; mother in it.  Real good extras on the DVD.
0767819462|1.0|I heard so many good things about this movie, I was totally dissapointed.  I absolutely hated the movie.  There was basically no plot &amp; the movie dragged on forever.  It was just two women fighting the whole time- a total waste of time.  I just think of all the productive things I could have done instead of wasting my time watching this letdown movie.
B000002B7M|5.0|In 1978 Black Sabbath kicked lead singer Ozzy Osbourne out and it seemed it would be another case of a rock star fading into obscurity. However Ozzy met guitar whiz Rhoads and the rest is history. In 1980 the best metal album ever was Sabbath's &quot; Paranoid &quot;, but &quot; Blizzard Of Oz &quot; definitely blows it out of the water. The amazing thing is that &quot; Diary Of A Madman &quot; is even better. In fact Ozzy would eventually sell more records than Sabbath. Sabbath, great as they are, never really had a good album. They made great songs, not albums. Ozzy, before the tragic death of Rhoads, gave us 2 masterpieces. All the album's are downhill after &quot; Diary &quot; even though he later gave us great songs like &quot; Bark At The Moon &quot;, &quot; Killer Of Giants &quot;,  &quot; Shot In The Dark &quot;, and &quot; Road To Nowhere &quot; He also has his crowning moment on No More Tears, which is of course the amazing title track. Anyway Here's My Grades.<br />                                        Song Grades<br />1. I Don't Know-A great rockin' song to introduce Ozzy and Randy to the world. I especially like the part in the middle.<br />     Final Grade-B+<br />2. Crazy Train-I know this is a legendary song with great lyrics and got him some much deserved exposure but the fact remains that this song is overated and overplayed too much for it's own good. He has made better rockers like &quot; Over The Mountain &quot; or &quot; Bark At The Moon &quot;<br />     Final Grade-B+<br />3. Goodbye To Romance-Although this is a good atmospheric song. It's kind of out of charachter for Ozzy. This sounds too much like Elton John for my tastes. He would make way better and much more heavier ballads than this sappy filler.<br />     Final Grade-C+<br />4. Suicide Solution-This is one of Ozzy's legendary and his most controversial song. Some parent's sued Ozzy because they thought this song convinced their kid to commit suicide. If they actually read the lyricsthey would see that this song is denouncing alcohol and was obviously written about the death's of Bon Scott and John Bonham.<br />     Final Grade-A-<br />5. Mr. Crowley-This is one of Ozzy's shining moments and one the best songs I've ever heard. This is deservedly a legendary metal song. The guitar in this song is virtuoso and it has great lyrics dealing with occultist Aleister Crowley.<br />     Final Grade-A+<br />6. No Bone Movies-This is one of the more underated songs on the album. While this is no &quot; Mr. Crowley &quot; it definitely isn't filler. This is a good rockin' tune with humorous lyrics dealing with an obsession with porn.<br />     Final Grade-B<br />7. Revelation (Mother Earth)-Now this is how a ballad should be done. This is one of the best song's I've ever heard. This is Ozzy at his most emotional and the lyrics are the best on this album. This also has Rhoads best guitar solo on this album which is saying alot considering his talent. In fact Ozzy would rehash this song with the excellent &quot; Killer Of Giants &quot; and the mediocre &quot; Dreamer &quot; Nothing however beat the original.<br />     Final Grade-A+<br />8. Steal Away (The Night)-Another one of the more underated tunes on this album. This is a good AC/DC like hard rocker and a great party-type song. They would however make a better one on &quot; Diary &quot; in the superior &quot;Flying High Again &quot;<br />     Final Grade-B<br />If you appreciate any of the genres or subgenres of guitar rock this album is essential.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I consider myself 2 b a HUGE Prince fan, but must admit that over the past few years his CD's haven't reached the heights of his earlier work (such as Sign &quot;O&quot; The Times, Parade, Purple Rain, Diamonds &amp; Pearls etc etc).  Sure, Emancipation and The Gold Experience were gr8, but last year's Joy Un2 The Rave Fantastic was VERY disappointing.  I think many true fans were starting 2 think his time had passed.  After hearing The Rainbow Children though, it must b said that he's on top form creatively and musically yet again and seems 2 b moving in2 new areas.  Sure, there r a few songs that could have been recorded by him anytime over the past 20years (i.e. they don't really go anywhere differently musically), but the vast majority of the material on this CD is absolutely amazing!!!!  It seems that he's no longer concentrating on trying 2 record &quot;hit records&quot; (as he's been doing continually over the past few years) and instead is concentrating on creating music 4 himself.<br />The highlights of this CD?  2 many 2 mention.  Personal favourites r The Digital Garden, She Loves Me 4 Me, The Last December, The Work......shall I continue?<br />Any1 who has any of Prince's many CD's should consider purchasing this CD - I guarantee that u won't b disappointed.  As 4 the guy who gave him 1 star out of 5?!!!!!!  Why?  Stick 2 Savage Garden and Britney Spears m8 - I'm sure The Rainbow Children is much 2 challenging 4 u.<br />Just buy this CD folks - it's excellent!
6305657947|5.0|I loved this movie! It is simple, not an Oscar-nomination, but it is very classy, and sophisticated. It is just a pleasure to watch. Even my husband liked it.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have been sitting here reading some of these reviews about how some of you dont like the Linkin Park cd.  Well if you ever looked into the lyrics and the true meaning you would change your mind.  All the songs have meanings,take 'Crawling' that is about one of the band members friends.  Also they deserve credit for being the most original band of the year.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I 've liked No Doubt since Tragic Kingdom. &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is a great album. My favorite tracks were Hey Baby, Underneath I t All, In My Head, and Rock Steady. THey have a nice reggae beat to a couple of the songs. Others are nice and mellow. There is a great variety to this cd. It's sort of a new sound to No Doubt, but i think it's good.
0688172377|5.0|Waris Dirie's story was stunning to me in many ways. I consider myself fairly aware of the diversity in the world, but the perspective of a woman growing up as a desert nomad was one that I could never have imagined. I love the way she captures the beauty and simplicity (in the best sense of the word) of desert life despite the life-threatening aspects she endured. Her strength, spirituality, and loving perspective remains with me a year later.  Her attitude is not just a lot of nice platitudes but it is clearly built on compexity.<br />It enlightened me more about the complexities of the female circumcision/ genital mutilation debate but this was only one of many enlightening topics.  One of my favorite aspects is how she maintains her focus on nature and simplicity even during her modeling career.
0312263511|5.0|&quot;Last Man on The Moon&quot; by Eugene Cernan is the cloest and accurate portrayal of the last mission to the moon, Apollo 17. It brings you so close you feel as if you are in the cockpit sitting atop the Saturn V rocket. I would defenately recommend this book to read, it provides knowledgeable insight into NASA and the Apollo program.  It is enjoyable reading, that will leave you wanting more!
B00003CXTG|2.0|Hollywood's timeline of epic films stretches back to the annuls of moviemaking, from timeless classics like &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; &quot;Ben-Hur,&quot; and &quot;The Ten Commandments,&quot; to modern masterpieces such as &quot;Braveheart,&quot; &quot;Rob Roy,&quot; and the infamous &quot;Titanic.&quot; With grand scale sets and special effects, talented actors and crew, big-budget status and studio backing, such movies are usually sure-fire winners. Moviegoers eat up these films, which almost always capture what is most important in an epic motion picture: the human emotion. <br />Add to this elongated list Michael Bay's &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; one of the few epics that fails to register much depth of feeling in its long, drawn out story that runs over three hours long. Like its predecessors, particularly &quot;Titanic,&quot; Bay's film also contains a love story set against an historical event steeped in the minds of millions of people who, until now, could only imagine the horror of what occurred on the &quot;day of infamy.&quot; The recreation of these terrifying events is absolutely spellbinding, a collage of glorious special effects that bring to life one of the United States' most gripping tragedies, though the attempt to place the fictional love story as a centrifuge for emotional connection serves only to push us further away from embracing the film. <br />It may come as a surprise to many that the film's credits include screenwriter Randall Wallace, whose script for &quot;Braveheart&quot; earned him high marks. The question burning on everyone's lips (including mine), concerns how the material presented in this film can be so juvenile and trite, considering his past work. The story centers around two young men, Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett), who grew up as friends and remain so in their military training as fighter pilots. During a health inspection, the two of them meet Evelyn (Kate Beckinsdale), a young nurse who falls instantlyfor Rafe, who does the usual routine of acting like a complete idiot because of his feelings. <br />As the story drones on, we begin to wonder if we will ever see what we have come to see: the promised bombing sequence of Pearl Harbor. Before this comes, we must watch as Rafe ventures off the England, is shot down and believed dead by Danny and Evelyn, who waste little time getting comfortable with one another. But Wallace's script also contains the age old cliché, &quot;If you don't see them die, they're not dead.&quot; Rafe returns, is angered, and lashes out at his friend and lover, just in time for the bombs to start dropping around them. <br />And it is here that the movie reaches the point at which it becomes a completely wondrous film: from the first shots of Japanese zeros taking off from their carriers, to images of planes flying over civilians of Hawaii, Bay sets up the sequence with a tension that mounts higher and higher as we wait for the first bomb to drop. When it does, the film unleashes its power, recreating the attack sequence with visual and sound effects that are eye-popping and impacting. Ships bursting into flames like fireworks, the U.S.S. Arizona meeting its fate in the movie's most expensive shot, the U.S.S. Oklahoma rolling over as its sailors become trapped underneath and inside... this sequence of events captures the horrors of war as well as hitting an emotional high note that registers equal amounts of action and soul. <br />The film not only pays attention to the ships in the bay, but also to the airfields and hospitals and the mayhem surrounding them. As planes attempt to take off in a retaliation effort, only to be shot down, the realization of defeat hits home, and hits home hard. The hospital scenes, shot in soft focus, are forceful and moving, terrifying in their graphic nature and realistic in their depiction of the confusion that ruled over so many people in their efforts to save the wounded. <br />In effect, one could say that&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is all spectacle and no soul, which it is to a point. The attack sequence is brilliant, yes: this is what director Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer are good at, creating dazzling special effects that surround tepid, emotionally flat stories. The love triangle, which takes excessive amounts of turns and changes of interest between the those involved, rules over the majority of the film, its banal approach lacking any interest that would keep us satisfied until we reach what we have been waiting for. Actors Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsdale all have a great deal of charm, yet put together they have no chemistry or believable moments; they are better left apart, as displayed during the attack. <br />This focus on fiction clouds out the nonfictional aspects and characters of the story, such as the building suspicion held by Captain Thurman (Dan Aykroyd), who believes that Japanese peace talks are a cover for something larger. Aykroyd plays Thurman just as any actor in a dated war film, but with believability, as does Jon Voight, whose performance as Franklin Roosevelt is terrific. Cuba Gooding, Jr, who makes an appearance as Dorie Miller, the African-American cook aboard one of the fleet's vessels, barely has any screentime; these are the characters worth watching, if only there were more material that involved them. <br />And for an event that marks defeat, the filmmakers seem determined to instill a sense of patriotism in audiences through a third act that focuses on the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, during which U.S. forces flew over the Japanese capital, destroying much of their munitions factories and military facilities. The catastrophic defeat at the Hawaiian naval base should end the film, yet instead, we are taken on another hour's worth of banality and ludicrous cliche, in which the people we guess will die do die, and everything ends on a high note of victory and happiness. For one of the darkest chapters in our nation's history, thissure has an upbeat ring to it once the credits begin rolling. <br />Many will remember &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; as being the big blockbuster that couldn't. There is grandeur in almost every aspect of its creation, yet the fictional contrivance fails to register any sense of emotional connection, and even overpowers what is good about film. Pyrotechnicians Bay and Bruckheimer have supplied us with a recreation as vivid and memorable as the event itself, but without any depth of feeling behind these characters, what good is the film as a whole?
B00005QJDG|5.0|take the best parts of every song you ever heard and the best parts of every concert you have seen and it's on this album and the dvd is awesome the playing is out of this world just get the album or dvd and see for yourself
B0000024JA|3.0|Upon first listen, Method Man's solo debut &quot;Tical&quot; may disappoint Wu-Tang Clan fans used to the raucous beats and crazed delivery on most of the tracks from  Wu-Tang's &quot;Enter the 36 Chambers.&quot;<br />It actually took me a few listen to understand how great this album is. <br />Imagine Wu-Tang Clan slowed down, thrown beneath a haze of tical, as Method Man unleashes his demons. &quot;Tical&quot; is the soundtrack of a man's soul crying out against the wickedness and social plagues that hamper his community.<br />The beats and sounds are suitably murky. It's more of a probing albums which gets you thinking as Meth rhymes over mostly non-commercial, raw and spare RZA creations.<br />The effect is haunting, blunt and eerie. When listening to it, it's the aural version of digging deep into the earth looking for reasons and truth and unearthing many demons and much pain.<br />The songs flow one right into another. <br />A complete left turn from the Wu-Tang style most of us were used to.<br />Not an easy listen, requires more mental focus and listening than your average Wu-Tang jam that flies by at the speed of light with spit-fire rhymes.<br />An intelligent release by Meth, who took a turn away from the commercial path to make a simmering album that won't find many fans, but will remain in many collections until it's dusty and old like the records of old.<br />fight on,<br />mykal roze
B00003CXDD|4.0|Willow is one of those movies that takes you back in time to when you were innocent and still believed in a world of magic.  It is the latest in a string of 80's adventure movies brought to DVD and is, arguably, the most over due.<br />For those of you who haven't scene this movie&#8230; it is a tale about a baby that is destined to bring about the end of the evil rule of Queen Bavmorda and those who will fight to protect that baby.  There are glorious battles between the minions of evil and the knights of good, there is a touch of romance, and there is magic. The scenery is stunning, the acting is pretty good and the story line has something for everyone.  Children will love the film for the playful nature of many of the characters.  Parents will love the film for the unlikely romance and the fun of seeing Val Kilmer in what I believe to be his best performance. This is probably one of the best family movies to come out of the eighties.<br />The DVD version doesn't boast very many extra features, but the color and sharpness of the film definitely make it worth owning.  The sound is pretty good, but nothing compared to some other DVD's out there.  For the most part this DVD is worth buying for the sheer fact of having the movie.
0201633612|4.0|I had to read through this book a few times to get the full measure of what's going on. I learned later that the GoF book, as it's known, arrived at a time when articulate information on generalized object-oriented design wasn't widely available.<br />Design Patterns touts itself as a catalog of time-tested formulae for creating simple, powerful class relationships. That's really being a bit modest. It's become the de facto methodology for documenting new, more complex patterns for several OO periodicals I've covered. It's also being used in academia to teach the design aspects of writing maintainable and reusable code.<br />As something to read straight through, however, add some caffieine to this book to make it. The prose favors a dry and technical style which, in my view, it didn't need. The examples were obscure for me, too. I couldn't relate to issues around coding a word processor, but I suppose it's still better than contrived or &quot;Hello World&quot; code.<br />I don't think any book deserves five stars for being the first of its kind; if you're filling a gaping hole, people are going to buy it because it's necessary. If it's also very good, well then score one for advancing civilization! This book is still The Book in its field, however, and well-written. You need a copy.
B0000214F0|4.0|Caligula is a non-stop parade of perversions, gore, and stunning sets.  Mix all that with a decent job of acting from some brilliant actors and you find that while you may be repulsed by some of what you see, you'll also want to see it again.<br />The movie graphically depicts of the rise and fall of Caligula (Malcolm McDowell), one of the most notorious of all Roman emperors.  It's rather straight forward in it's portrayal of the man and his exploits.  Throughout the movie you definitely get a feel for how demented Caligula became and in the end you are almost relieved when his life is ended.  The major draw back to the story line is that they never really develop any of the other characters and it leaves them as shallow figures.  <br />Keep in mind that this movie was brought to us by Penthouse so to say that there is a fair amount of nudity and sex is an understatement.  There are also some rather gruesome scenes as well.  I've read many reviewers use these points to put the movie down, but what they fail to realize is that Rome did have it's dark days of mass perversion.  Yes, the movie did go over the top a bit, but it's not too far off from the decadence of the time.  If you keep this in mind you will love the movie.<br />As for the DVD itself.  The sound quality is much better the the original VHS version, but still leaves a bit to be desired.  The picture is a bit grainy and that does tend to draw away from the breathtaking sets.  I recommend the unrated version for the sole fact that the R-rated version cuts out a large chunk of the movie.  It also has a nice documentary on the making of the film.
B00000K19E|2.0|OK Maybe it was just me, but I was REALLY confused when this movie ended.  I guess maybe I was really tired but I don't understand?!  Why was every flying around, going into the crappy world anyway?!  I didn't understand it and it was not an intellectual movie either!!  There were no long serious themes going on in this movie, nothing earth shattering.  I think that it was an action flick, nothing more nothing less.  Don't expect any more.  It said nothing long lasting, and was in no way a classic, ok it had cool special effects but so did a lot of bad movies.  OK, I am sorry to be the odd one out and say I didn't like it but I didn't!  I don't think this one is worth it, maybe a rental.  Make it a Blockbuster night  :)
B00005UKE0|5.0|What do you get when you combine a top notch band, an epic producer, and a former Beatle who was waiting for years to get his moment in the spotlight? The best solo release of any of the 'Former Fabs', that's what. Harrison's sad passing has caused many to now reflect back on his career with a rose colored view; however that is not necessary when one looks at &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. Harrison tackled life, love, God, and most poignantly, death on the ablum, and he did so in a beautifully poetic manner.  Whereas Lennon brutally forced his views on you, and McCartney danced around them with &quot;La-La-La's&quot;, Harrison brings his early wisdom to you in a reassuring and passionate voice. Phil Spector's production has long been criticized for being suffocating; but on certain songs, it is just right and allows Harrison's message to be conveyed in a sweeping, touching manner. George sings his soul out on every track, and the band backing him (which included Ringo, Clapton and Preston to name a few) is out of this world. His career may have tappered off a bit after the release of this album, but then again how did the other ex-Beatles fair after their &quot;epics&quot;? Lennon lost most of his magic after &quot;Imagine&quot; until his return to the music world. And it took Lennon's assassination to bring relevance back to McCartney's career after the flops that followed his &quot;Band On The Run&quot;. If you don't already own this album, go out now and get it! Hearing George speak so philosophically about life and &quot;The Art of Dying&quot; will leave you with chills running down your spine.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Today i just bought this DVD from the future shop in Canada. Because i don't have the DVD-Player, so I just tried it with my DVD-ROM. The strange thing happened: my Norton Antivirus poped up a window and it said there's a W32.FunLove.4099 virus in Disc 2. But I don't believe it, so I still tried to run it. Tonight, I want to make sure if there is any virus in my computer; so I used Norton to check all the hard drive. Do you know the result? There are 526 files are infected by FunLove. It's terrible! I don't believe my eyes! I strongly ask the DVD company to destroy all these DVD.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This work definitely rates 5 and one half stars!  <br />&quot;You won't regret it, come an' get it...&quot;<br />Sincerely, Lioness.
0385505833|1.0|I very much enjoyed A Painted House and had high expectations for this book as well. It was childish, from the character names to the inane plot (?). I would have liked to contact Mr. Grisham, but found through his web-site, that that is not possible. I would, in all probability, invest in a sequel to A Painted House, but will steer clear of any &quot;holiday specials&quot;, The Grinch has a much higher rating in my opinion.
B00003CWTI|4.0|I don't know if Paul Thomas Anderson will ever make a masterpiece. His last two films, BOOGIE NIGHTS and MAGNOLIA, are both too long and rambling to qualify. I would have enjoyed both more than I did (and I really, really liked both of them) had he narrowed his scope. The movie could have been shorter, and Julianne Moore's character could have been cut altogether,<br /> Still, I think MAGNOLIA deserves four stars, because it's filled with all of these wonderful little scenes and moments: the rain of frogs, the entire gameshow, the barfly who quotes &quot;the lovely Samuel Johnson&quot; (actually, it's Samuel Boswell where that line comes from), William H. Macy getting fired, John C. Reilly's speech at the end, and his interaction with the young rapper, Tom Cruise's self-help seminar, everything about Phillip Seymour Hoffman.<br /> As for the reviewers who complain about &quot;wanting their three and a half hours back,&quot; what would you have done with them?
B00005KB9T|5.0|This is good, real good.  Great mellow guitar riff on Stir it Up. Catch a Fire, with its \\"Slave Driiiiiiver, da Table is Turned\\" mixes aggressive and vindictive lyrics with a chill beat.  Marley means what he says, but he doesn't knock you over the head with it, he just drives his point home slow and steady...High Tide or Low Tide is my favorite song about the testament to friendship and how it helps you get by.  Marley's combo of the jah movement and politically charged lyrics makes for some...fine music.  One of my faves in any genre.
0198711905|5.0|On a recent trip to England, I saw Twelfth Night at the RSC Theatre. Of course, being a TEENAGER who LOVES SHAKESPEARE, I had to stop by the Shakespheare Birth Trust Company and visit the house he lived in. That is where I picked up this wonderful book, along wih a few extras. I feel in love almost instantly with the cover art and the way it was printed. Including all his plays, sonnents and poems, it's a great collector item for Shakespeare fanatics.
B00000634J|4.0|I like most of his early solo stuff, but the later stuff where he got all upbeat can be kinda grating.  I listen to his earlier albums like Imagine and Plastic Ono Band a lot more than this for their overall cohesion and unity.  Oh well, most of it is classic stuff I'd reccommend to Lennon newcomers.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Of course the DVD could have more extra feaures but the next edition surely will. Clever biz move.<BR>But the movie itself is absolutely OTT.<BR>It deals among other topics with magic in ordinary life and the doors that lead to it.<BR>Many bands like Mirror or X Japan for example use the same color symbols pattern which stand for passion.<BR>KURENAI = crimson color = deep red.<BR>It stand for many things, first of all and most crucially for:<BR>ROSES and BLOOD.<BR>X {Japan}s first single was called KURENAI and founded that concept.<BR>In Amercian Beauty the symbols of KURENAI always reoccur and make it really interesting in terms of visual art and not only fabula of the movie itself such as the context, the meaning and text. But visually all is bonded by images that are so real and realistic and at the same time magic and special.<BR>Really gifted.<BR>I wonder if Sam Mendes is an X Japan fan?
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I'd heard the description &quot;breathtaking&quot; used countless times before but never actually experienced the sensation myself, until I saw this movie.  My breath disappeared twice, so awe-inspiring is the sweep of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. I won't bother to try and explain (it's impossible), just buy this DVD or go see it at the cinema. Utterly, utterly perfect.
0743420373|3.0|The book is a kind of research paper. The authors are, after all, academics. They have attempted to provide a &quot;composite&quot; picture, based on extensive research, of the average American Millionaire. What they have found is that such an individual is difficult to identify. In general, though, they are self-employed, hard-working, thrifty, etc. They do not drive expensive cars, live in mansions on golf courses, and wear a Rolexes. <BR> <BR>One of the biggest contradictions in the book is this: The authors have found that most millionaires will die rich. But they have also found that most people who inherit great wealth end up as good-for-nothing parasites, rarely accomplishing much in their own lives. My tongue-in-cheek analysis, then, is that these millionaires shoud try to die broke. <BR> <BR>The book is filled with statistical information about the habits, professions, and lifestyles of millionaires. At times, the reader will feel somewhat bored as a point is driven into the ground. Overall, though, the book is worth reading. We can all benefit by adopting some of the implied suggestions of this book. Work hard, plan for your retirement, live within your means. Just don't get carried away. Stop and smell the roses from time to time; strive to be rich in experience. When you're on your death-bed, I seriously doubt that you will say, &quot;Gee, I sure wish I'd spent more time at the office.&quot; Ask a dying person what they would give for another year or two of life. The answer: everything they have. The sunset on Maui is beautiful. Life is short and precious; enjoy it.
0812550706|5.0|I am not usually a huge sci-fi fan, the Star Trek and Star Wars books (by their sheer number alone) make me cringe.  However, the Ender series by Orson Scott Card is much less about the technology and futuristic aspects of sci-fi, and more about actual humans who happen to live in a future with technology greater than our own.
078401115X|5.0|AngelHeart is one of my favorite movies of all time and stars 2 of my favorite actors Robert DeNiro who plays a perfect devil, and Mickey Rourke who plays his role perfectly as well.<br />Note: the films climax features 2 of the best going back and forth in one of cinemas greatest scenes of all time... and if you enjoy rourke in this film, check anything he's done in the 80's, it's all amazing.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|HI.  I am a Prince fan.  I like most of his work. I will admit though if you are a fan or a person that wants to buy an album with radio singles on it this is not it.  If you want a musically inspired album, this is it.  Prince made this album sound good,  I mean it does in noway sound overproduced like most of his albums in the 90's except for Crystal Ball, and Chaos &amp; Disorder. This is an album that is meant to be listened to all the way through at least twice, then pic your favs out.  Rainbow Children has some of the finest guitar work on any Prince album, and his song Last December is probley his best overall song in a while, it is a lil long though. <br />So in review if you want a musically AWSOME album, this is for you.  If not go ahead and get another rap album to dance to, since its going to have the same beats you already like in every other album thats out there. But to me thats old and boring, this CD is not. Jazz maybe, but not boring.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I was highly anticipating the new release from No Doubt. Unfortunately, I am quite disappointed. &quot;Rock Steady&quot; plays like a sampler CD. Nearly every song begins with a sort of fade-in. Absolutely no intros: guitar, bass, drums, or otherwise. Then the song is four or so minutes of a chorus repeated again and again. One reviewer described it as listening to a broken record. I have to concur.<br />I'll admit, the grooves and sounds on this CD are superb, but there's no semblence of a decently constructed song. Maybe this works for trance, but it doesn't suit No Doubt very well.<br />The one notable exception is &quot;Hey Baby&quot; which actually has a normal song structure.<br />I'll stick with &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; and hope No Doubt puts out some better material in the future.
0790744759|5.0|&quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; is by far my favorite movie musical. The songs themselves are so memorable, joyous, and fun. I sang them after I saw the movie, actually. Judy Garland is in probably her best performance ever as Esther Smith. Margaret O'Brien is equally superb as Tootie. The scene where she sings &quot;I Was Drunk&quot; is hilarious. She also broke my heart when Garland sang to her, &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;. I liked that MGM used turn-of-the-century period songs like &quot;Skip to My Lou&quot;. That gave the movie an authenticity and made it real. If you're a fan of movie musicals, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; is one of the best of the genre.
6304479689|4.0|What a difference two years can make in the life of a touring mega-star. Having recently purchased the excellent DVD of the 1970 Elvis - That's The Way It Is, I was unprepared for the drastically changed Elvis of this 1972 theatrical release. The changes are not just in his appearance, but more importantly in his vitality and vocal performance. In fact, the appearance aspect was the least of my concerns. True, he has put on weight since the earlier film, but so what? He still looks handsome at thirty-seven, and if there are telltale signs that his lifestyle is beginning to catch up with him, then this is hardly surprising after 16 years of relentless stardom. Far more worrying, however, is the decline in sheer vocal quality.<br /><br />From the very first song (Johnny B. Goode), Elvis sounds tired and slurred. His voice is worn, and lacks the resonant beauty that it had just two years earlier. On many of the slower numbers (eg Separate Ways, Love Me Tender and Bridge Over Troubled Water), a distinct \\"wobble\\" has crept into his singing, making it difficult for him to sustain a smooth line in the quiet passages. (Compare these with, say, his 1970 recording of Twenty Days and Twenty Nights and the unevenness of his later singing is immediately noticeable.) The change is nowhere more evident than in his middle register. He is still able to belt out the notes in climactic moments - An American Trilogy is proof of that - but gone is the wonderfully rich baritonal quality and freshness of his earlier singing.<br /><br />The decline seems to have set in from 1971 onwards. Up until then his voice had been magnificent, with 1969 and 1970 arguably his peak years. There would still be moments - even right up until the end - when he would regain much of his former vocal beauty, but overall I believe this documentary confirms an ominous decline that would continue with the 1973 Aloha from Hawaii concert.<br /><br />Maybe the problem was simply tiredness and over-use of his vocal cords. If this was the case, then it's unlikely that those closest to him would have ever succeeded in reining him in. For as this video makes abundantly clear, Elvis loved touring, and his need to perform was a constant driving force.<br /><br />And what a great performer he was! Vocal problems aside, this is a fascinating study of THE pop icon of the twentieth century. Far from being \\"static\\", as Leonard Maltin asserts, this is a fast-moving look at the hectic whirlwind of Elvis Presley's touring life. There are also reflective moments of quiet beauty, notably when Elvis rehearses gospel numbers with his troupe. Elvis' occasional narration also adds much to the film.<br /><br />This is an honest, warts and all look at Elvis, and well worth your time.cords.

B000002LK1|5.0|Listening back, I'd rate Depeche Mode's 7th studio effort as the definitive highpoint of the band's career. It seems that after a steady progression of album songwriting and sonic experimentation, Depeche Mode were at the height of their synth-tech powers when they created an album of uncommon cohesion and clarity that is Violator.  This is perhaps the dark, moody Rubber Soul of techno; a composition of very nicely conceived and produced pop music, where not just every song, but each element fits together in a uniquely enjoyable manner.  Violator easily ranks high among the most relevant albums of the last century. <BR> <BR>Minimal, subdued, and less synth-heavy than DM releases prior, it's probably true that the band were going for a more accessible sound with this album, but it isn't a sellout by any means.  From the dubby coda of &quot;Personal Jesus,&quot; or the evil shriek of &quot;Crucified,&quot; to the moment the drums kick in on &quot;Clean,&quot; Violator's sound only seems to ripen with age in the growing world of electronic music.  Perhaps this is the well developed product of a long term experiment in the fusing of carefully selected sounds.<BR> <BR>On this album, Gore's obtuse lyrical style hits new levels of ambiguity.  Themes of honesty, regret, guilt, sacrifice, solitude and suffering persist in a manner that perhaps anyone could relate to.  Though it's impossible to pinpoint what he's written about on &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; and mammoth-chorused &quot;Halo,&quot; these are some of the band's most powerful tunes, hands-down.  Also worth noting, &quot;Clean&quot; lays out a fit closing to the album, and contains a haunting fade that consistently leaves this listener reaching for the review button. <BR> <BR>The vocals soar when the album culminates in possibly its finest moment, &quot;Policy of Truth,&quot; where most bars are co-sung by Gahan and Gore.  Rather than fading, this song winds-down beautifully in an extended refrain, where the vocalsresonate against some innvoative DM manipulated guitar and synth ambience.  This is the sound of a band that, 12 years ago, had progressed well beyond the power chord.   <BR> <BR>Elsewhere, a reprise occurs in the mainly mid-period trend of hidden music, most notably with the unlisted side 2 arrangement, &quot;Crucified,&quot; an eerie, disorienting episode of droning synths, acoustic guitar, and a chilling vocal sample.  This, a part of a very strong mid-album section beginning with &quot;Halo,&quot; rounds out Violator nicely. <br />Strangely lacking or even cold in its stark minimalist production on the first few gos, Violator isn't for everyone.  But it's the sort of album that could gradually seduce the listener when given the opportunity.  With some of the best songs of these UK techno-pop studio grandmasters, it remains devoid of fluff, commercially accessible, ingenious, and deadly.<br />Anyway, you get the picture.  Play it loud. :-)
B000002IWQ|5.0|When I first played Counterparts on the day of its release, my initial reaction was of relief. Presto and Roll The Bones were both very good, very polished but there was I felt, something missing. With Counterparts Rush were back to their meatiest, heaviest and most powerful sounding album since Power Windows. Quite simply, opening track 'Animate' IS Rush; I found it to be the most exciting and energised Rush song since 'Tom Sawyer' - this is the sound of a band who have once again discovered how to play as a combined unit.<BR>This unity of sound and power culmintes on the slick, groove driven instrumental, 'Leave That Thing Alone.' This track must be a contender as one of the bands finest moments. Rush remarkably build this momentum as the the album draws towards a close with the dynamic, 'Cold Fire' and 'Everday Glory.' The latter track features some of Lifeson's most moving and emotive guitar work to date. Counterparts easily deserves its five star rating and is, in my opinion, one of the best albums they have ever recorded. It is definately the best Rush album of the 90's.
0553277472|5.0|Pirsig's book is pure genius.  Even from the standpoint of my Christian ideology I agreed with the bulk of the argument in this book.  Moreover, I felt that it was beneficial to my own spiritual life, to my relationship with God, and to my ability to evaluate my Christian walk as I live it on a daily basis.  Well-written, captivating, perhaps even &quot;breath-taking&quot; would be an acceptable term, this work has permanently changed the way I look at life.  Read it.  It's for you.

B00003CXRM|5.0|What a great movie!  The acting was superb and the music was awesome!  No wonder the soundtrack won best album of the year!  <BR>My favorite scene was the sirens and that beautifully haunting song!!<BR>I bought the soundtrack and listen to it all the time, and can't wait to own the DVD also. <BR>I am now a fan of George Clooney, and Tim Blake Nelson (who did his own singing in the movie!)and John Turturro.<BR>This was absolutely the best movie I have seen all year!
B00005OM4N|5.0|This album was excellent! Whe I first heard the clips off the internet, it left me wanting more. I decided to pre-order it and once I got it, I was in awe on how different the music was. It sounds much better than Oops...I did it again and ...Baby One More Time. <br />Overprotected has a great beat to it and many teens can relate to the song. I give it 5 stars!<br />I Love Rock 'n' Roll was o.k. I was expecting something more spectacular and I got a repetition of chorus throughout the song just like I Can't Get No Satisfaction. It's just annoying. I'd give it 3 stars.<br />I'm not a girl, Not yet a Woman is a good song that shows Britney's true voice. It didn't have any synthetic instruments like all her other songs. It's a great start to Britney's ballad songs. Unfortunately, it was the only ballad on the album. I give it 4 stars.<br />I'm a Slave 4 U was a single I personally enjoyed most. Besides You Drive Me Crazy Remix, it is the only single you can dance to. What is so great about it is, it's different and the sound is just great. I love it. It is one of my favorite tracks off the album. I give it 5 stars.<br />Anticipating is o.k. It has a little bit of a Janet Jackson sound which is good, but it's boring for Britney. It is a fun song but I think Britney should stick to her own style. I give it 3 stars.<br />What it's like to be me! Well, I HATE it! It's horrible! It's so dull and it sounds like Justin and Britney didn't put much work into it. I am very disappointed with the work they did. I thought it would be great because Justin did a good job with Celebrity. It was a bad way to end the album. I give it a disappointed 2 stars.<br />Lonely is a song that when I heard the name at first I thought it would be a slower song like Lucky but to my surprise, when I heard the cool beat in the begining of the song I was surprised. I fell in love with the song. I love the ending when the orchestra kicks in. It's just so emotional and when I had on for the first time,loud, I almost cried. Good work with this song Brit! I rate it a proud 5 stars.<br />Boys is pretty cool. It's right for Britney's age. Probably not for mine, but I still enjoy it. It's kinda like I'm a slave 4 U. The beat is cool but what annoys me are the whispers you hear every time. They are so annoying if you are using headphones. I think their were to many but I still give the song 4 stars.<br />Let Me Be has that R&amp;B sound ad I enjoy it. I give it 4 stars because it isn't fast enough to dance to but oh well. Nice Job Once Again!<br />Bombastic Love kind of reminds me of Britney when she first started out. It's kind of like a flashback song. Britney has gone a long was from ...Baby one more time to Britney. It 's great to remember all the great things she did. Now she's here and better than ever before. Even though this song doesn't seem like a great song I'm glad they put it on the album. Britney: Great Job! I give the song 5 stars for all your hard work!<br />That's where you take me is a fast song. Even though it doesn't see it, it is! It's an o.k. song. I give it 3 stars. It wasn't anything special.<br />And Cinderella! Oh, this song is great! Like Lonely it is very emotional. I love to end the album with this song because this song is the most powerful song on the album and Britney really has a powerful voice on this song. I give it 5 stars! Great work on this song Britney! Great work on you album. And most of all, great work with your career. I can't wait to see what you do next! Good Luck!
B00005LC4B|4.0|While serving time for a sex crime, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) discovers that his disgusted lawyer (Nick Nolte) buried evidence that could have reduced his sentence.  Released after 14 years, he starts using a psychological jackhammer on Nolte and his wife and daughter (Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis) while becoming increasingly dangerous.  Story and characters are expanded a bit from the 1962 version, and a terrifying performance by De Niro, but a lot of gratuitous violence and unpleasantness thrown into the mix.  A nail-biter to be sure, but more and better aren't the same thing.  Original stars Robert Mitchum, Martin Balsam, and Gregory Peck make cameos here.
B00005QZWJ|3.0|This soundtrack is big, varied, well orchestrated, and at the very least what it needed to be to carry the epic nature of one of the most sweeping quest sagas written in the modern English-speaking world.<br />I recommend this product as very accomplished, enjoyable, grand, and fun. As movie music it is above average and relatively innovative. Buy it if you're a fan of John William's music, epic or action/adventure music in general, or even New Age and \\"world\\" music. Howard Shore interestingly pulls from all of those genres.<br />But, while you're online right now--also consider buying Leonard Rosenman's soundtrack to the 1978 \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" too. (The 1978 movie itself, however, is a study in good intentions gone awry.)<br />I note here that Leonard Rosenman's 1978 soundtrack took more risks by far than Shore's soundtrack does. For me, Rosenman's soundtrack is more memorable because it is less derivative.<br />Personally, I find Shore's themes elusive. (Sometimes I try to hum them when running errands and they just morph into the theme from Star Wars or Tchaikovsky's 5th Symphony.)<br />Rosenman's choral Mordor drones, sparkling passages depicting the triumphs at Helm's Deep, and sorrowful ballad to Gandalf's memory are all extremely enjoyable, and evoke Tolkien's world just as effectively as Shore's music does, though differently.  Also, the 1978 soundtrack stresses the peripatetic quality of Tolkien's yarn far more than Shore's music. Rosenman's main theme suggests travel and movement; some might argue it's even too light-hearted in sections.<br />To describe Rosenman is not to criticize Shore. Both soundtracks are very different and good in different ways.<br />Shore's music is distinctly modern--more than Rosenman's, which had a stronger medieval flavor. Shore's work has a bit of Benjamin Britten's \\"War Requiem\\" in its blood, I think; but also, for better or worse, quite a bit of John Williams, too. Shore's lone female singer in the Lorien passage is right out of \\"Blade Runner\\"--a touch of the East in its sound--or even a Portishead track. It's extremely digital-sounding, too. (The soundtracks to \\"Glory\\" and \\"The Mission\\" use choral orchestration more interestingly.)<br />Other choral sections of Shore's work have a somewhat Anglican flavor--personally, I don't mind that--as if influenced by a Evensong service at King's College, Cambridge. But why not? After all, liturgical, conservative, sacramental Christianity was an inspiration to Tolkien himself, and informs his writings. (Though Tolkien was Roman Catholic, not Anglican.)<br />The 2001 soundtrack captures more successfully than the 1978 soundtrack the grandeur and gravity inherent in Tolkien's tale. Compared to \\"Phantom Menace\\" or any other fantasy or sci-fi flick from the same time, Shore's soundtrack is unquestionably superior. However, for a movie that is not merely superior but, in fact, positively sweeping in scope and detail at nearly every level, the soundtrack perhaps under-performs just a tad.ight out of \\"Blade Runner\\"--a touch of the East in its sound--or even a Portishead track.

6305842442|3.0|Did it ever occur to anyone that without an original cut available to compare to a director's cut, then that director's cut simply becomes THE cut? <br />Yes, like most people I prefer the director's cut... but what is there to compare it to anymore? How are we supposed to know its superiority to what the film execs did if we can't, in fact, watch it? It hasn't been available to purchase since the early 90's and on inferior VHS at that?<br />80 bucks for 1 DVD and some lobby cards? Surely you jest.<br />We get it Mr Scott. They ruined your vision yada yada yada. But you'd really be able to gloat if we were able to see these 2 cuts side by side in the same vain as the Brazil box set. Talk about a butchering. What they did to that movie is nothing compared to what was done to Blade Runner. And yet Mr Gilliam and Criterion have released a 3 DVD set that includes the horrid 'Love Conquers All&quot; version for us to compare to his original vision. And it's only 50 bucks.<br />Some of us are nostalgic for the original cut of Blade Runner we saw in the theatre 20 years ago and it is a true testament to excellent directing and storytelling that it could still be enjoyed even with the voiceover and different ending (It's also a testament to the original cut that VHS copies of the original cut go for 40 plus bucks on auction sites). If the movie hadnt have been that good you wouldnt have even been able to re-release theatrically 10 years later. <br />Am I right or am I right?

B00005JKHP|2.0|I love the movie but is there something wrong with Robert Wise's glasses? This 40 million dollard movie is full of speckes and scratches all along. The restored scenes are fine the sound is very good, but the rest looks like an old &quot;BETA&quot; print!! I also wonder why the Klingon battle music theme was cut at the beginning?? The score is one of the most beautiful score ever written for a movie, why cut it? Most of the scenes that were added for the TV version are cut. Weren't those scenes requested by the fans at that time? I would have liked both versions on the same DVD. Look at Fox's ABYSS and ID4, and what about the French track?? I guess I was expecting too much! I'm very disappointed and Paramount's DVD's are still too expensive.

0792846338|4.0|'Misery' is every bit as unforgettable as you would expect of Stephen King's better books.  It is not only increasingly unnerving, but also darkly humorous.  In it we see James Caan as the author on a particularly successful franchise of books about a woman called Misery.  Whilst on his way back to his publisher (Lauren Bacall), he crashes his car and is rescued by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), his number one fan, who nurses him back to health.  However, when she finds out that her favourite author is putting an end to Misery, she goes over the edge.  The film is actually based on a real-life experience of Stephen King's whereby a man broke into his home, claiming that he had a bomb.  It talks about the way in which fans can all too literally trap their idols under through their heightened expectations.<br />The script is another stroke of genius, with several scenes from the book being wisely deleted.  For instance, a police officer that Annie runs over with a lawnmower (something that actress Kathy Bates thought would be funny) is emitted.  Whilst in the book it's another stage in Annie's mania, on the big screen it would just seem silly.  Secondly, the acting too is superb.  Kathy Bates gives the performance of her career, with James Caan just as good as her frustrated captive.  The tension between the two is wonderfully paced and you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat in many scenes.  What makes Annie such a disturbing villain is that her seemingly ordinary nature, using quaint phrases such as 'dirty birdie' whilst carefully tending to a small farm.<br />There are countless highlights here but the end battle is brilliant.  It's not often that King translates well to the screen, but here he does so in style.

B00004S6GL|5.0|Figure 8 is one of the best, most complete albums Elliot Smith has ever made. As a more recent Elliot fan, I started with XO, bought Figure 8 and then worked backwards. His earlier, lo-fi albums (Either/Or) especially are fantastic, and just as good as Figure 8 - just different. If you've never bought an Elliot album, start with XO and work backwards, you'll be amazed. As for Figure 8, however, it stands along with Either/Or as his best album. Moving forward from the confusion of XO - which marked his transition from from a lo-fi acoustic sound to more of a produced, pop (pop as in The Beatles, kiddies...) sound - Figure 8 retains some of the same sound as XO. Unlike the overproduced XO album, the electric guitar, keyboards and strings are truly part of the songs on Figure 8, not just a forced afterthought. After listening to this album a few times and going back to listen to XO, Elliot must have been thinking \\"hey, a record deal! And money! And a full studio! Sweet...\\" Meaning, use of production just to use it. From the opening notes of \\"Son of Sam,\\" it is obvious that Figure 8 will not follow the same path. Figure 8 marks a lyrical return to the same emotional subjects in his earlier albums, and even earlier with the band Heatmiser. Songs like \\"Everything Reminds Me Of Her\\" and \\"Somebody I Used To Know\\" are as good and \\"warm\\" as anything has ever done. Longtime fans may have to listen to \\"LA\\" and \\"Stupidity Tries\\" a few times to get into them, but overall Figure 8 is a fantastic album, a real 5 star record. Figure 8 marks Elliot's new direction - a more vibrant, melodic pop sound while still true to his indie beginnings. One of the best indicators of this is the song \\"Color Bars.\\" While it would have worked equally well as a solo acoustic piece on one of his earlier albums - \\"Roman Candle,\\" perhaps - on Figure 8 the addition of a keyboard only increases the song's beauty. <br />Figure 8 is one of the best albums made during the 90's, and maybe even beyond that - it as close to perfection as I have heard in an album, and whether you've enjoyed Elliot in the past or not - Figure 8 is definitely worth a few listens.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This DVD is a must-have for any serious collector.  In addition to the film itself, which is well worth the price alone--especially in this fully-restored version--the DVD set offers more than an entire disc to bonus features.  The wealth of information is only part of it, though--the experience of digging through the material, guided by your friend the Magic Mirror, is thoroughly engrossing.  Just as amazing, though, is the website.  Like the DVD, the site has more than just information--games, activities, animation and music abound.  Cheers to Disney!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I must admit that when I first went to see Mouln Rouge in the theaters, I was most reluctant.  It looked cheesy to me, but I kept hearing good things about it.  So finally I went, and was blown away.  This movie, from a writing aspect, breaks no new ground, but visually,it is astonishing.  The beautiful thing about film is that the same story can be told over and over in different styles.  And Baz Luhrman's style is most definitely unique.  The movie pulls you in from it's opening moments, and rarely lets go.  I did find the movie slightly over-indulgent at times, as though Baz was throwing certain visual effects in for the sake of throwing them in.  But the acting all around is incredible, and the music is absolutely genius.  Many may have a problem with what could be describe as a 2 hour music video, but I loved it.  It is definitely geared towards the MTV generation, but I think it can be enjoyed by all.  All in all, it is the best movie I have seen in a long time.

Bruce delivers a great show... Bruce leaves a part of himself on the stage each and every night. I've seen Bruce live before, bit I missed out on this tour (I don't recall him making it through Arizona). But after viewing this concert on DVD, I feel like I was there. I was never one for MTV or watching music videos... but this is different. This is an \\"experience\\". Great song selection (not just the hits), outstanding camera work & editing, superb sound (better than the CD). What's not to enjoy? Bruce & Band have set the bar extremely high for a DVD music concert experience. The ONLY other music DVD that's close (tho a distant 2nd place to this one) is the Eagles \\"Hell Freezes Over\\". Highlights include \\"The Promise\\", \\"American Skin\\" (about the Diallo shooting), \\"Lost In The Flood\\", \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\", \\"Land Of Hope & Dreams\\" and \\"Badlands\\"... heck, it's all good. If you are even the slightest of a Springsteen fan, this will be a real treat for your eyes & ears (5 stars).
B00005QDW1|4.0|Yeah, I'm a fannie-come-lately (started with Tragic Kindgom) but quickly became a full-on No Doubt fan and bought all the albums.  Kingdom is one of those albums that grab you and drag you in, and for me the key to that is the absolutely KICKING bassline.  I mean, really, how can you listen to the bass of songs like &quot;Different People&quot; without breaking into a smile.  It must have taken me ten times through the song to realize there were others playing in that song besides Tony.<br />I guess that's why this album is a slight disappointment.  The range of music is pretty cool, and does still push the envelope a bit, blurring the lines between reggae and the traditional ska fare, and adding some poppish tunes as well.  The variety is ok, and is pure No Doubt -- irreverent and somewhat in the face of traditional music types.<br />So is it a sellout?  Maybe if you take a single verse or even a single track at a time.  But not when the album ranges from collaborations with Bounty Killer (I laugh out loud when they cut in on &quot;Hey Baby&quot;) and Lady Saw (&quot;Underneath it all&quot;) to a capella riffs with TAFKA-Prince on &quot;Waiting Room&quot;.<br />On the whole, Rock Steady is a good album, but I miss Tony's ultra-melodic riffs.  Maybe he's lost his inspiration since breaking up with Gwen.  I could see how that could take the edge off his playing...
0525244581|5.0|This book is simply magnificent. I've been reading the Tao for years and never had I made the correlation of Pooh and Taoism. From the start you see how Hoff ties in Pooh to the ancient chinese philosophy, and having Pooh as a living and breathing character in the book helps. Pooh injects his simple nature and gentle humor into everything which is just so.. well, Taoist.<br />I found myself entralled by how wonderful and charming Hoff made the book. He made it's reading an enjoyable process.<br />Now for those of you who are new to Taoism or having trouble with its principle nature this will be a helpful book. I read some of the reviews of those who didn't understand the book or perhaps Taoism in general. Western minds often think too hard about everything. If you can relax and simply accept the book and its message as it is presented you should see its beauty.<br />Taoism is like the sky is blue and the grass is green, it is simple and amazing and Pooh makes a great representative to deliver its teachings.
B00003CY0V|5.0|First of all, don't listen to me. In fact, don't listen to anyone when it comes to this movie. It's one of those that you will either love or hate, there is no in-between. The best thing to do is just see it for yourself and develop your own opinion on it.<br />Now, if you decide to listen to me after all, here is my review.<br />I'll be honest, when it came out on video, I had never heard of it. When it was mentioned to me by a friend, I thought it sounded like some cheesy, Steven Segal movie, so I was hesitant to rent it, but I went ahead and got. <br />The opening scene is very misleading. It starts out with John Travolta's character talking about movies. It's kind of slow and if you've seen Get Shorty, you start to wonder if this is what it's going to be like. This theory is proven wrong not one minute later. It catches your attention from the beginning and holds it until the very end. To say you saw what was coming is very misleading but that's exactly what this movie is. Misleading. It leads the viewer in one direction, then does a 180, curses along for a while at 75 MPH, then reverses 10 feet and goes left. The ending is a classic, ending in an unconventional chase sequence that will leave you breathless. All in all, I would say it is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. One of Mr. Travolta's best. And Halle Berry wasn't too bad herself. ;)<br />But, as I said, don't listen to me. Go out and see it for yourself.
0784011222|4.0|It seems America needs the help of John Rambo one more time as he treks out to the rugged mountains of Afghanistan to save his friend.  This movie is packed with action straight from the beginning until the end!<br />Starting off in the Orient where Rambo seeks to find inner peace by living with Buddhist monks and making some extra money by stick fighting locals.  All is well until old pal, Col. Trautman and his CIA friend show up to persuade John to help them funnel arms to the Afghan freedom fighters, (who at the time were fighting the Red army).  Rambo quickly declines the offer (Even after seeing some persuading pictures of maimed Afghan children) claiming his war is over.  <br />Dissapointed, Col. Trautman leaves on a solo mission with a convoy of Afghan and American fighters to end up being caught by a ruthless Russian commander who tortures him, and Afghan men and women prisoners day and night.<br />Rambo learns of the news and now is forced to back to the war he didn't want to fight to save his friend.   Along the way,  he makes Afghan friends and saves the day by almost single handedly taking out a whole Russian battalion including Spetnaz commandos.<br />The story is straight out of a comic book, but this movie was made to please one market.  Die-Hard Action fans like me who just love to see a one man army take on overwhelming odds, kick enormous butt, and live to tell about it.<br />On a Sidenote: <br />In the end of the movie, a message gives thanks to: &quot;The Gallant People of Afghanistan.&quot;  Which is the least the makers of this film could do since during the whole movie, Rambo is depicted as the man who turned the tide.  Anyone who doesn't know yet, the Afghan/Russian war was solely fought with Afghan blood, but with our gold.<br />In ways Afghans and Rambo are alike.  Both were given covert help by the CIA, both were lied to, and both were left to die.  Now again USA is helping Afghan freedom fighters to topple the evil Taleban and Al Qaeda, but this time they want in the action.  <br />Rumours of Rambo IV are everywhere and there are claims that Stallone is writing a screenplay as we speak.  If it's true, let's hope this trilogy wraps up with a bang!

1878424114|4.0|The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success goes over the basic rules you need to follow in order to achive a spiritual balance. According to Chopra, reaching this balance will allow you to get anything you want from life: health, money, happiness, etc.<br />The book is short and very simple to read. I only wish he had expanded the implementation of each of the rules a little bit more.<br />Other than that, it's an excelent book.
B00004Z1MN|4.0|I can't remember the last movie I've seen where I actually cheered at the climax of it, but this is it.  The ending happens in such a fast-paced manner that you can't figure out what's going to happen until it's actually happening!  Very few movies keep me guessing until the end - and fewer still surprise me - but this one did both.  I highly recommend it.
0060987464|2.0|While I can't say one way or the other, not knowing the man personally, I still think that a lot of the &quot;life experiences&quot; he depicts in here are pretty hard to believe.  His writing style is all over the place, seemingly knowing what he's doing one moment, then jumping around leaving you unsure of even his *approximate* age during the next chapter.  I'm not even completely sure if everything is happening in order.  Some stuff may seem really hard to believe (like his youth) if you hadn't grown up in a quasi-rural Mid-Western area, but while it's possible to have happened, I think he's not only adding, but also embellishing certain parts of his youth in an attempt to impress the stereotypical mentality of his fans, and, judging by what almost every other review that I have read notes, his assumed plot seems to have worked.  In short, he's displaying way too much grandeur for his allegedly &quot;like-minded&quot; skeptic to take seriously, even if his writing style may seem apparently amateurish in parts.  Some points (like his lists of &quot;rules&quot;) show a sense of humour and give evidence that he probably shouldn't be taken seriously, which I suppose could be taken either way.  I'm not exactly what to make of Chapter 16 or the chapter I can't readily identify that basicly details an acid trip.  I also don't normally think much of an autobiography or mere biography that is occupies approximatly one fifth of the pages with old magazine interviews in the middle of the story when they could have just as well been compiled in the back of the book as a magical little thing called an &quot;appendix.&quot;  I suggest getting this, plus some unauthorised stuff and reading the Rolling Stone articles and then judge for yourself what is Brian Warner: kid from small-town Ohio and what is Marilyn Manson: big enormous rock star.
B0000507R0|5.0|This has been among my very favorite albums for almost 30 years!<br />As you can imagine, I've listened to it many many times.  But hearing it in surround sound was almost like listening to it againf or the first time.  I thought I knew this album inside and out (I'm a keyboard player in a prog rock band and have played several tunes from it), but in DVD-Audio I hear things that I had never heard before.<br />The album just comes to life in both DVD-Audio AND Dolby Digital (I've listened both way) with its higher audio quality and use of surround sound.<br />My personal opinion is that the biggest gain comes from going from old CD quality to Dolby Digital.  DVD-Audio is the best, but even if you don't have a DVD-Audio capable DVD player you'll love this version almost as much as if you did so don't wait.<br />This one title made me want to go out and upgrade my rear speakers and get a DVD-Audio player.  One warning though: although it varies from title-to-title, on THIS DVD-Audio the rea channels are playing music/instruments and not merely contributing ambience and sound effects as on some others.  What this means is that unlike Surround Sound for movies, for DVD-Audio (particularly this disk) you need GOOD music quality rea speakers.  Most of the stuff sold as rear satellite speakers for movie surround sound simply are inadequate, and might even get damaged at high volume levels.
0767802659|5.0|About time someone made 'The Master of Snooze' Robert Heinlein's book into a watchable movie.  Heinlein's writings are almost without exception very dry and unfilmable, with the possible exception of &quot;Have Spacesuit, Will Travel&quot;.  I've plodded through the book and seen the movie, and I can say this: While the film diverges wildly from the book's original plot, the movie takes the good parts of the book, adds a few parts of its own, and makes it into something that is more entertaining than anything Heinlein's ever written.  Sci-Fi action at it's finest, with no worries about being PC at all.  Best line?  &quot;I'm from Buenos Aires and I say KILL 'EM ALL!&quot;...either that or... &quot;God-Damnned bugs whacked us, Johnny!&quot;  Cheesy, sure.  Fun, definitely.  In this film you get a pretty good feel of what Heinlein was writing about...but the preachiness and the sense of &quot;I am the greatest Science Fiction Writer Ever&quot; thankfully never rears its ugly head.  Of course, this is very obviously a film made by the guy who directed &quot;RoboCop&quot;, so the violence takes center stage over the social commentary.  You can bash the book, or you can bash the movie...but they are two gloriously different things, and I say if you want to have a good time, watch the film.  If you're out of Tylenol PM, read the book.<br />DVD specs?  Great Video, Great Audio...demo material here.<BR>A few extra features, but as this was an early DVD release, it's not really on par with anything released these days.  A few deleted scenes, screen tests, etc.  The commentary by Verhoeven is good if you can get through his thick accent.
1883217040|5.0|There was a time when it was a common adage that Jazz can't be taught. You were either born with it, or were lucky enough to pick it up... to some extent that is true... as there is a time you have to lift your head from the books and learn on the bandstand... but the question is how to get to that point - - the point where you can benefit from lead sheets or learning off of records, or by communicating with other musicians ?<br />For many years, a lot of the &quot;Jazz&quot; educational material on the market was either antequated by the time of publication (remember going into music shops to find &quot;modern&quot; piano books that would teach you how to play stride version of Honeysuckle Rose and the Maple Leaf Rag?)... other books contained misleading information, or some of the better ones required technical reading skills (as well as hand spands and chops) that few Jazz masters themselves were known to possess (!) - - Finally, over the years, a few breakthroughs... two of the earliest that come to mind would include books by David Baker and John Mehegan. - - But most of us still wondered, &quot;When is somebody going to write *the book* ?&quot; - - ...finally someone did.<br />The publication of this book has launched Jazz education into the modern era... Very readable, well presented, modern, practical, never over academic or esoteric, and requiring the most minimal amount of reading of musical notation possible - - and written for a generation raised on Miles Davis and John Coltrane not Fats Waller and Louis Armstrong (as great as they were.)<br />Combining this book with the right listening, hands on playing (check out some of the Aebersold play-a-longs) and the right fake book... in a situation where a great Jazz teacher might not be so available or affordable, with the right attitude (check out Berliner's Thinking In Jazz) - - this book is your spiral bound musical conservatory, with advice relevent to players of all levels... From those basic intervals, scales, chord voicings and changes that all Jazz students learn in their first lessons, to the insight required to &quot;put it all together&quot; - - This is a great reference for everyone, from the begining student, the aspiring amateur trying to get into a program (or take his or her playing to the next level)... to the seasoned veteran who'd like to learn the language and reason and gain better insight into what he or she is playing and hearing in order to grow as a musician.

B0000027D5|3.0|Hey, I like Santana........since 1969, I have enjoyed his musics until maybe, early 80s.<br />After the day is done, the 2 rock guitarists closest to my heart are \\"Jimi Santana\\" and \\"Carlos Hendrix\\". Both have/had unique styles,but REALISTICALLY, both were \\"limited\\" by the fact that they were self taught musicians . Both sought to expand their musical vocabularies, Jimi was to associate with Miles Davis until his untimely demise and early exit from this planeta.<br />Carlos, on the other hand, aligned himself with some AMAZING musicians-- Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter, Mahavishnu McLaughlin, and Herbie Hancock.<br />Santana was entering a \\"new fase\\"(spiritually and musically) towards a sound that married his highly individual \\"streetwise\\" attack & frasing with the sounds of \\"Love Supreme era\\" John Coltrane jazz.<br />Caravanserai was the beginning(and featured Santana's BEST playing to date, in my opinion), followed by \\"Welcome\\" and \\"Borboletta\\". A #1 recordings, I love 'em!<br />Here's where \\"Lotus\\" comes in.<br /> Santana is a \\"demi-god\\" in Japan, and the original 3 lp set featured the \\"Welcome\\" lp band recorded ao vivo (live!).<br />This band featuring the piano/organworks  of Richie Kermode and Tom Coster & the inventive funky electric bass of unheralded Doug Rauch-- a \\"killer bassist\\"!<br />Here also lies the \\"problem\\" with this recording.<br /> On \\"Welcome\\", Santana graciously (& wisely) takes a \\"backseat\\", offering much of the prime solo work to Kermode, an inventive & firey player.<br />There wasnt much \\"Santana guitar\\" on that set, probably the reason it wasnt one of his better selling recordings.......<br />Paradox--\\"Carlos-san\\" tours with that band, and if you listen CAREFULLY AND O-B-J-E-C-T-I-V-E-L-Y to this recording, SANTANA IS OVERMATCHED BY THE REST OF THE BAND-- horribly so.<br />Tight, funky latin jazzrock, with solos that rival the finest jazzmen , Santana would have been \\"a-ok\\" with his older bands, but here he is overwhelmed and alost \\"unnecessary\\".<br />REALLY LISTEN, apart from some flashes of his old melodic , singing guitar on the slower tracks(\\"Samba Pa Ti\\" & the release on \\"Incident at Neshabur\\")--Santana spends his time \\"flagellating\\" his echoplex effectbox & endlessly runs the trademark \\"Santana Glissando\\"into the ground(I lost count at 2000 glissandi)!!<br />Otherwise, this is a real attractively funky set,with some \\"Electric Miles Davis\\" style jamming on some new and old \\"classic\\" tunes. Well, what was carlos' next moves??<br />(...)<br />Santana was on the road to musical deliciousness before he fled back to his musical womb. No more inventive excursions, bent string/glissandolandia for us from then on........(it's still better than 95% of the rock guitar out there, though!)<br />I hate to Santana bash, I dont think I AM if you understand what i am saying.<br />A good sax, or a Miles Davis-style  trumpet instead of Santana, and Lotus would be 10000000 stars, it burns!

B00004Z4UW|5.0|This review will not include any direct details about the movie, just in case you, good reader, happen to be one of the four people on the planet who haven't already seen it.<br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a coop. The Wachowski brothers have managed to infuse a great, up-to-date sci-fi storyline with touches of Zen Buddhism, Taoism, and influences of modern philosophy starting with and returning to Soren Kierkegaard. The art direction is sublime, weaving future noir with comic book and producing a wonderfully believable cloth. The writing is solid. Even Keanue Reeves is believable as the in-the-dark protagonist through which we discover this world.<br />The DVD is gorgeous. The features are solid. The behind-the-scenes is an amazing look into the massive effort involved in bringing something like this to the screen.<br />The fact that the Wachowski bros were able to introduce such important and beautiful modes of thought - by infusing the very nature of the story with them - while wrapping the whole package in a action-packed veneer is breath-taking. A move of genius. An entire generation of kids will now grow up thinking, howerver subtly, about these motifs. This aspect of the film, historically speaking, makes it hugely important. The fact that it's a fun and wild ride makes it wonderful.<br />I file this movie in my collection next to my Kubrick DVDs.
0783225792|5.0|This is probably in the top 3 mafia movies of all time. The story is intrique and well written.  Great acting, the more you watch it, the more you'll be convinced.
B00005N9CV|5.0|My wife seems to have a knack for coming across fantastic singers. She introduced me to Russell Watson, and now Diana Krall. Ms. Krall has a tremendous voice; soft, silky and sultry. It's just perfect for listening to with your partner during a romantic dinner, or simply sitting and staring at the fire while having some wine. Also, I find it relaxing to have on the car stereo system while driving down the interstate. The combination of singing and piano playing that Ms. Krall brings to this album is superb, and I know that I will always be a fan of her music.
B00005QW5X|5.0|&quot;Hedwig and The Angry Itch&quot; comes at a critical time when popular arts, specifically acting/theatre and rock music, have sunk to an all-time low.<BR> <BR>Who knew that a movie/play/satire about a East German tranvestite rock and roller would be such an inspiring movie? I sure as hell didn't when I first viewed this during the summer. I walked out of the theatre with a lot of hope for the future.<BR> <BR>Face it, actors/actresses don't know how to act anymore without exhibiting some degree of self-consciousness. John Cameron Mitchell, who also conceived the original play and did a terrific job of directing, gets 100 into the role of Hedwig, a character that is flamboyant, absurd, funny, heartbreaking and a terrific communicator. And the man is the first genuine rock and roll heart I have connected with in too long a time. Even though it's a ficticious character, he blows away a good percentage of today's, ahem, &quot;rock&quot;.<BR> <BR>The lovely Miriam Shor is terrific playing a man (in this case, Yitzak, Hedwig's love interest) and shows an amazing energy, dramtic flair and punk rock spirit. A ballsy performance and an excellent example of losing yourself in the role and making it effective.<BR> <BR>And the music? You like Punk, Gothic, Glam, Rockabilly, Heavy Metal, Psychedelia and good ol' knees up singalong? Look no further. This is some of the very best TRUE ROCK MUSIC (and Show music) that I have heard in ages. Catchy, nervy and rocks like hell.<BR> <BR>The film is a remarkable acheivement. What could have turned into a routine filmed performance or even a performance piece, is actually a fine story with great editing, energy and plenty of color. It could have been a garish display, but Mitchell has done the impossible by keeping the camp and making a truly focused work. Let's see more form him.<BR> <BR>The DVD comes with a remarkable 80+ miniute documentary about the history of &quot;Hedwig&quot; and interviews with all involved. This is truly indispensible stuff and highly entertaining.<BR> <BR>Multi-media pieces usually don't work in the cinematic realm. John Cameron Mitchell has succeeded in this impossible accomplishment and also created what is a long overdue creation in cult cinema.<BR> <BR>And that is? The first TRUE rival to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. Give Rocky credit for starting the genre, but give John Cameron Mitchell plenty for taking it further and producing a labor of love on every level. <BR> <BR>I will never tire of &quot;Hedwig&quot;. It is most welcome in this current era of pop atrocity (Robbie Robertson croaking Supertramp? Yeah, right...).
B00005OWEG|5.0|Some of the extra footage (lengthy though it was) was pretty entertaining and helped convey whatever message Coppola was sending. Some of it might have been just boring. As for me, I'm in the army at Ft Bragg and without a doubt, my favorite additional footage had to have been the flooded out medical unit that had water buffalo grazing about. These were not just any buffalo , for they had &quot;Buffalo, U.S. Army, 1 Ea&quot; stenciled on the side. NOW THAT IS THE TRUE MADNESS OF THE ARMY EXPOSED! Ten bucks says that was John Milius's invention!
0871137380|5.0|Okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but this book makes you really feel like you are IN the thick of combat.  Excellent description of the mission's intention and original plan, and how it all went bad.  The only thing missing is a flesh wound and a guy screaming, &quot;Medic!&quot;  Truly excellent writing.  I devoured this book in three sittings.
B00003CXXS|5.0|JP 3 is a well-executed sequel. The movie is extremely fast and packed with action. Time is not wasted with unnecessary character development, yet each character is introduced, and you get a sense of what this person is all about. The story is simple and very easily understood. Even though Dr. Allan Grant is back, the story actually has very little to do with what happened in the first two films. This combined with all the new dinosaurs, gives the movie an original twist. The velociraptors this time around are unbelievable, and that Spinosaur is simply terrifying(T-Rex gets his head literally ripped off). JP 3 clearly surpasses &quot;The Lost World&quot;. It's a Summer movie packed with nail-biting action and fun. I just wish it could have been a bit longer. The DVD is definitely worth the buy. There are some great extras to be seen here.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The minute I sat down, i was pulled in. Moulin Rouge has been on of the most magical, entertaining, and captivating movies I have ever seen. Ewan McGregor has an absolutely FANTASTIC voice... the voice than made up my descision to marry a guy with a good voice and have him sing to me all the time (and Ewan isn't exactly hard on the eyes either...)His performance is wonderful and earnest, emotions clearly showing on his face. Nicole Kidman is also wonderful, capturing the image of an icy/emotional seductress whose voice was surprisingly not bad. The imagery was amazing, keeping me on the edge of my seat, each place so distinct that it shall remain in my memory a long time. All the vivid places, colors and how the movie was layed out was absolutely brilliant. The songs were mixed perfectly, the soundtrack never comes out of my cd player (though i wish they had added more songs from the movie). Le Tango de Roxanne was GREAT...i tried not to blink but it didn't work. The ending left in tears and i couldn't even bring myself to get up until all the credits were over. An absolutely fantastic movie; this one will be in my dvd collection.
B00003CXMG|5.0|The innocence and total lack of such in the different characters... the contrast between being naive, and being so naive that you don't know that you are. You have two worlds, one of sweet idolitry, and one of the life of a rock star. The intertwining and meshing of them is told very well by this movie. I would have to say it's one of the strangest (not from a content perspective, but one of style) movies I've seen ever. But also (easily) one of the best.
B00004Z459|4.0|For those of you who have written a review and criticized Linkin Park for their lack of \\"true\\" hard metal rock, then I think you should pick up a dictionary and look up the word \\"hybrid.\\"  Think about what the name means.  This group is putting something new together-- a blend of the different genres of music.  Hence the name, \\"hybrid.\\"  It's really embarrassing that you can't even figure it out.  In addition, if you want hard core rock, then why'd you buy the CD in the first place?  Before you go using your money on something you don't like, do a little research-- that's why Amazon is here.  If you don't like this type of new music, then stop criticizing and go listen to what you DO like.  Everyone likes different things.  The point is that there is no need for harsh criticism.  Open up your mind to new things.  I personally think this group is clever and courageous and I commend them.  Their songs are great, combining different styles of music, making it suitable for many [open-minded] music listeners.  I think \\"In the End\\" \\"Runaway\\" and \\"Pushing Me Away\\" are great songs.  Another nice fact about Linkin Park is that their lyrics are meaningful-- not just poor annoying complaining about how life (is bad).  It's great that this group has both music talents and writing skills.  Thanx for reading.

B00005RFAI|5.0|Honestly how many artists do you know that can do rock, pop, R&amp;B, hip/hop, jazz, soul, and funk into one shiny package??? Pink is that artist. Standouts are #1, #2, #5, #7, #8, #9 and #12.
B00003CXXS|5.0|For those seaking huge long dramatic movies with complex, Oscar-winning scripts and plots...you're looking at the wrong movie! Jurassic Park III is awesome! I don't know what the hell is wrong with you people who are giving this bad reviews! JP3 has got some awesome action, and this is a great DVD to add to your collection. For those who loved the first, you will like this one. For those who loved the second, you may be disappointed. But for those who loved the first AND second...you'll be in heaven with this one! <br />JP3 stars Sam Neill as his recurring role of Dr Alan Grant who claims that no heaven on earth could get him to go back on the island of Jurassic Park. When a rich couple, Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy &amp; Tea Leoni), pay Grant a large sum of money to take them across the island of Isla Sorna (site *B* where the Lost World took place) for their honeymoon, Grant reluclantly agrees as long as they don't land on the island and just fly across it on the plane. Grant brings his new paleontologist partner, Billy (Alassandro Nirvonna) along for the ride. But as they fly across the island, Grant notices that the Kirbys have worried expressions on their faces and keep staring out the windows, as if they were searching for something. Finally, a huge dinosaur pops out of nowhere onto the scene and completely destroys their plane...the two pilots get eaten and the foursome just barely manage to escape. Now, Grant, Billy, and the Kirbys are stranded on the island. They soon confess to Grant and Billy that they are divorced and that the real reason why they wanted to come here in the first place was to look for their missing son, Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan), who got stranded on the island a few weeks ago while para sailing with Amanda's new boyfriend. Grant and Billy agree to go searching for Eric, but warn the Kirbys that Eric is probably dead. But finding Eric is just the beginning and not their biggest problem. Their biggest problem is getting off theisland...alive.<br />Though the plot may seem cheesy and lame, the movie itself is not. I saw this movie on opening night in the theaters and absolutely loved it! The acting is great, the special effects are absolutely stunning. Why shouldn't the producers show off what they can do with special effects? The dinosaurs look so real. This is an awesome DVD, too with great special features such as the making of JP3, cast &amp; crew interviews, the setting of JP3, and more! I can't wait to buy this DVD. You shouldn't pass this movie up if you love action flicks. You'll totally regret it if you do!
B000025APX|5.0|It does not come often that I award 5 stars to an album, and when I do it means that I have found something truly special! Although initially averted from the sound, I gave these Swedes a chance and was thoroughly rewarded with one of the best metal recordings I have found in a long time.<br />At first listen, Amon Amarth's music may sound like a buch of noise (I originally made this mistake). But when one listens to the works, it is evident that a lot of intelligent composition has been drawn upon to write these great pieces. Instead of relying on a lead guitarist and synths for melody (as in the great Children of Bodom), Amon Amarth form complex melodies via the clever use of chords. And these are not your grandfather's chords either! The progressions are lenghty and quite melodical. Amon Amarth have definitely one of the deepest and fullest sounds in the Euro metal scene today...<br />'The Avenger' is Amon Amarth's sophomore release and continues to build on the great debut 'Once Sent From the Golden Halls.' Now, I will refrain from basing my review on the core beliefs of the band's members as they really do not have anything to do with the music (vocals are another matter- intelligent discourse on Pagan beliefs, frustrations, mythology, etc).<br />I am currently listening to &quot;North Sea Storm&quot; and cannot help but smile at the beauty of brutality! The song has about three or four different movements and a handful of melodic paces. &quot;Bleed for Ancient Gods&quot;, &quot;The Last With Pagan Blood&quot;, &quot;God, His Son and Holy Whore&quot; are other songs that stand the test of time. The only song I don't have much attachment to, though, is the title track &quot;Avenger.&quot;<br />I pride myself on being one to go out and give countless unheard metal talent a chance in case of finding hidden treasures! This album is definitely a motherload of great music and I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great new band... and Amon Amarth havenot even reached their peak yet!
0671024256|5.0|I read Danse Macabre by Mr. King years ago, and while this book covers some of the same autobiographical roads as the prior book, it's still highly enjoyable.  This book is part memoir and part helpful advice on the craft of writing.  King sprinkles the book with his usual self-depreciating humor.  The most poignant part is when he describes the accident that nearly took his life a while back.  Anyone who is interested in any type of writing, not only fiction, will find this book useful.
B000056O5M|5.0|This is an album which has kept me good company for nearly three decades. If you have enjoyed it in the past, you should buy this gorgeous re-mastering - it is worth it! If you have any inkling to buy it, I would encourage you to invest the extra few bucks to hear the great playing in its full glory.
B000002J0B|5.0|\\"Houses of the Holy\\"<br />The 1960's finally ended with the opening bars of this record. Long awaited, long delayed, at least for those days, the arrival of 'Houses of the Holy' ushered in a New Era of Rock; this is, perhaps, THE seminal album of the 1970s, for many reasons.<br />Complimenting the achievements on this record in no way disparage what came before in the Zeppelin catalogue. However, it is critical to understand the context of this album, that of breaking away from the past, and initiating a great leap forward, as it were, from everything that had come before in Rock & Roll.<br />While virtually all of the other hard rock bands of that time (1972-73), both good and not so good, were attempting to catch up with Page and the mighty Zep, here, the Supergroup casts away, at great risk, any concern for those fans seeking remakes of 'Whole Lotta Love', ad nauseam. Instead, an entirely new color of sound, and new approaches to technique, arrangements, and production, are offered.<br />Within 'Houses\\", Led Zeppelin delves into uncharted territory on multiple fronts with an astoundingly-dynamic set of original tunes that define the tone for everything to follow. <br />Let the art bands of the day bite their lips.<br />The most significant revelation on the record is the emergence of John Paul Jones, nee' primarily the Zep Bassist, as a fully-accomplished songwriting collaborator, and keyboardist in his own right. Jones' massive contributions to the record are two-fold: first, his songs are outstanding; second, his immense involvement relieves some of the pressure from Page, allowing Jimmy to not only accompany Jones on the Jones compositions, but to excel to a greater degree on Page's own pieces. <br />Let's get to it. 'The Song Remains the Same' is, perhaps, Jimmy Page's 'tour de force', 'Dazed & Confused' & 'Achilles' Last Stand' notwithstanding. The opener, and rightfully so, literally breathes a musical sigh of relief in some societal sense. Vietnam was allbut over, and the age of dope smoking youth as a norm had begun. The thud thud thud of all that came before had also departed, here in deference to a 12-string electric mini-symphony that exudes a sense of hope on the horizon. A new age, the 1970's, had begun. <br />Page's guitar work on this track is perhaps his best. The master producer and multitracker lays down a backdrop of bizarre, yet compelling chords, then overlays incredibly inspiring, and uplifting flat-pick solo work that constitutes a complete departure from anything Page had released before. This may well be an essentially Jones' tune, but Page takes it over and makes it his own, much to the jubilation of all those who love it. It plays like the dawning of a grand morning, leaving the death dirges of the Zep competitors in the dust.<BR> <BR>This tune also represents Robert Plant, without doubt the keynote rock lyricist/vocalist of the era, at his best. Plant tells a story that is worded without need of words. The emotion, power, and range that Plant brings to this piece cap off the tune. Most people don't listen much to Led Zeppelin's words. That's not an insult to Plant. In this case, you don't need to understand or appreciate the lyric, even though its monumental in the execution of the tune.  Here, Plant is ultimately emotive, in any case, and gives so much to the performance in terms of synergy that it doesn't really matter what anybody hears beyond the sound of his here-perfect voice.<br />Space limitations prohibit a true track-by-track review. The other piece on this record that deserves special note is 'No Quarter', a pure Jones' keyboard exploration, complimented by a super-cool, understated Page solo. There are no words to describe how unique, and stunning, this tune is. It is Jones hitting his stride as a songwriter, and as a musician, and a true equal of Page.<br />It is important to note that most of the songs on the fantastic follow-up album, 'Physical Graffiti' were written during this period. Even the title tune was apparently not ready and appears on PG. <br />(No slight here to Bonham, the greatest rock drummer who ever lived. He rocks throughout).
0762408480|5.0|I just really love Charles Dickens old tale. And this young readers edition is perfect, the drawings are beautiful. This is the story of the old miser Scrooge, who on Christmas Eve are visited by the gost of Christmas past, present and yet to come. And so he finally discovers the real meaning of Christmas.
0767802659|5.0|There are so few movies out there that can combine action and satire in one sitting, yet Starship Troopers manages to blend both into a refreshing cocktail of entertainment. True, it doesn't stay TRUE to the book, but whats the last movie that has been based on a book that has been completely faithful to the book? I dare you to name less than five movies that haven't strayed from the book, and that have been a commercial success. (Couldn't name three, could you?) Most of the people criticizing the movie didn't mention a thing about the characters, or the plot. (they mentioned that the plot didn't exist, but that's it) What is up with that? <BR>  Casper van Dien plays Jonny Rico, a good ol boy from wherever. His girlfreind, Carmen Ibanez (ooh, first deviation from the book! Extremists beware!)decides to join the Federation, and he follows in her footsteps. He gets assigned to Mobile Infantry while she gets to be a Starship captian. To complete the triangle Dina Meyer plays Dizzy Flores, who likes Jonny despite the fact he likes Carmen. Ah, the tangled web we weave whenever we plan to decieve(or something like that) The result comes out as interesting interplay between the characters. <BR>  The plot isn't really a factor in the movie. This might be a death nell to some other moveis, yet starship troopers has no problem explaining things on the go. The plastic acting(they're supposed to be plastic, by the way. Something about having to fill the role of a steriotype) is exeptionally...plastic. Each actor plays their part to the best of their capability.<BR>  All in all, this is not only an enjoyable DVD, but an interesting story as well. It touches on the totalitarian fears that Heinlein had in his novel, yet easily appelas to people who've nerver read the book. If you like action, interplay, and just want to kick back, check the movie out. It is definitely worth your while. (to all those who say the movie is bad, try directing your own movie and see how easy it is! Itwasn't as if this movie was even as bad as the Avengers!)
B000001ELB|5.0|This album is a compliation album featuring the best of the studio recordings from 1973-1978. It is the album that I take with me on roadtrips.  It came out in 78, (I have the LP) This was the Best of, before the current Best of album.  Note: The album Best of KISS is also a good album; but its a mix of songs from a different period.  DP is the True Best of studio recordings album
B000002J03|5.0|I was a young boy, and I listened a dream song Moby Dick...<BR>This was my 2a. album I bought in my life. It´s a mark in my live.<BR>I love LZ!
B000001EL7|4.0|I was in summer school when this came out!  The high light of my day was when a freind brought this album into class and begged for permission to play \\"Christine Sixteen\\".  During a lunch break we put it on and cranked it UP!  That day is forever etched in my brain!  What a summer that was!  These guys were like real live comic book heroes! and they played rock and roll too!  I was enthralled...The music grabbed you, the pictures caught your imagination, and the prospect of catching a live KISS SHOW,was the ultimate goal!  (Sounds like Detroit Rock City, huh??) Yes, I can identify with that movie on a personal level!  Sorry, I digress.  Ace frehley's debute: SHOCK ME, inspired many a young guitarists, Christine Sixteen; defined the summer of 77.  and the title track; now a standard: LOVE GUN!, the song, the album,  An intergral peice of 1970's rock and roll! I own the original LP. CLASSIC!
B000024A70|5.0|YOUR REVIEWS ARE VERY INFORMATIVE, THE THING I ENJOY THE BEST IS EASY ACCESS TO THE KIND OF MUSIC I LIKE.
B000002UAX|4.0|For 30 years, WHITE ALBUM has seemed like a thrown together assortment,some top of the line, mixed in with probably this band's rock bottom. We have, once again, Paul leading the fight with some more timeless ballads, &quot;I Will&quot;, &quot;Mother's Son&quot;, and some old vaudevillian numbers like &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;, and &quot;Honey Pie&quot;...But we have &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot;,&quot;Me and My Monkey&quot;, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (which achieved notoriety with the Manson gang),&quot;Why Don't We Do it on the Road?&quot; (Paul at his worst),and &quot;Yer Blues&quot;.&quot;Back in the USSR&quot; still is some fun (a BeachBoys takeoff), but &quot;Birthday&quot; is again not of Paul's best.Even George's famous &quot;Guitar Weeps&quot; is done too loudly. There is a mellow version that sounds a lot better. &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; for the past  20 years seems even precognitive,sadly,with John singing the title words.&quot;Blackbird&quot;, and &quot;Rocky&quot; may still inspire young guitarists, for good reason. And &quot;Long,long,long&quot;,&quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;, and &quot;Good Night&quot; are as good as ever...If only the group eliminated the junk, and added a handful of even medicore material, the album would stand up much better!! oH, AND &quot;Julia&quot; is John at his introspective best,singing about his long gone mother.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is a well done war drama honoring those men and women whose lives were taken by that horrific December 7, 1941 attack. The special effects were phenomenal and the love story, between the characters of Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett, was very believable; contrary to what other critic's feel. The gripe I have about the movie is that they showed 4 modern day destroyers(Spruance-Class) rigged together, and subsequently exploded, in the attack sequence. Now, as a former U.S. Navy sailor, I know that those destroyers did not even exist in 1941....they were commissioned in the late 70's early 80's. That part of the film disappointed me, somewhat, but didn't turn me away from liking the movie, overall. This is a great movie that really shows the human spirit from within the hearts of so many! I highly recommend this film! Buy yours here, today friends! Peace to all!<BR>                                      - Dennis F. Towle<BR>                                        Hayward, CA
B000002A46|2.0|I bought this album thinking I was gonna enjoy some Christmas music but this CD just didn't sit well with me. I was skipping through the songs bigtime. Oh Holy night was so boooring and seemed to drag on forever especially in the first 2 long drawn out verses. Most of the other selections were just average or borderline 'typical Christmas song'. I honestly don't recommend this as a worthwhile purchase. <br />Other christmas albums which I purchased from Amazon were Celine Dion's 'These Are Special Times' and 'Christmas Extraordinaire', Mannheim . Now these 2 albums are Christmas Master-Pieces. Don't miss out on these two.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Talk about a total turnaround, everything that has been good about No Doubt in the past is pretty much gone from this album.  It sounds like Gwen went in and laid down about a 10-second track for each song and then the producer just hit the &quot;Repeat&quot; button to fill the rest of the song.  I'm listening to the album for the first time right now and it's totally true!  Whoever wrote the lyrics for these songs must have been extremely lazy.  What happened to No Doubt the &quot;band&quot;??  Pop music is ruining my world!!
B00005QDW1|2.0|WHAT HAPPENED?  No Doubt went from playing awesome music, true ska, to playing electronic pop stuff....i know most bands &quot;sell out&quot; but i mean come on....I would not reccommend this record to anyone who liked the old skool no doubt...it is not ska...it is TRL music...Gwen did Eve change ya??? Terrible....stick to your roots...
0385505833|5.0|I am a big fan of Grisham, and was intriqued that he wrote such a light novel.  So, I read it and laughed all the way through it!  Grisham describes the typical Christmas build-up perferctly.  And the ending is not only a surprise, but a pleasant surprise.  Try it!
B00005QCYC|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION BUT IF YOU WANT THE FIRST 2 WITH DTS SOUND JUST BUY THEM SEPERATELY.BUT IT IS A GREAT COLLECTION TO OWN IF YOU WANT TON'S OF EXTRA'S.THEY INDIVIDUALLY ARE EXCELLENT MOVIES ALL ARE WIDESCREEN 1:85:1.THIS WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT COLLECTION FOR CHRISTMAS.SO GET IT NOW DON'T PUT IT OFF.
B00005NW02|5.0|I bought this CD based off of the fact that I loved Chop Suey... and after the first listen I was very disappointed.  It didn't remind me much Chop Suey.  I liked about 4 or 5 songs, and found the rest of the CD too odd.  I thought about shelving it.  I listend to it again (as I always do with a CD I don't like on the first try) and found myself liking more than half of it, with only a few tracks that I didn't like.  After a 3rd listen, I found myself liking everything, and loving 4 or 5 tracks.  The CD is now my favorite that I've heard in years... not a single bad track... <br />The originality, diversity, and raw songwriting talent of this band amazes me.  I guess I have to go get their debut CD now... I'm definately a convert!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I bought this cd about 3 years ago, and i loved it from teh first day that i listened to it. although it doesnt quite come up to Evil Empire, i still think its great.  My favorite songs are Guerella Radio and War within A Breath.  All of the songs have great lyrics and the instruments come together to make an awesome sound.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes rock or wants a hard album in their collection.  Tom Morello is the best guitarist ever!!!
B00005N5S2|1.0|In my review of the Midway 'Collector's edition' DVD I asked the question: Why won't someone put out a complete version of this movie on DVD or even VHS?  I ask the same question for this DVD. It is also a much better movie when complete and you almost never see it that way. I ask the company who put this DVD and the Midway DVD out to please call up TNT cable channel and get the copies of the uncut versions of these films, now!
B00005O5JV|4.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise - I was not expecting a whole lot, however the charm of Reese and the plot had me interested the whole way...  Despite the initial 'I am going to hate this thing about some sorority queen' feeling, the movie progresses into something just simply great fun to watch.  I found myself cheering our 'dumb blonde' right up till the end once she starts to take the law school thing seriously.  A lot of cute twists and gotchas that far outweigh other movies in this category!!
B000002952|5.0|I borrowed this album from a friend after hearing the song Con Los Anos Que Me Quedan (track 1). Absolutely brilliant...and that was only the first song. I found the songs very vibrant and felt that it was sang with feeling (after all, Gloria is very proud of her Cuban roots) and full emotion. The first track is one of my all time favourite songs.... maybe it's time I pass the album back to my friend..... NOT!<br />Get a copy.. you'll love it
B0000524CY|5.0|This is such an awesome movie....and the transfer to DVD is amazing!  To say this movie was made in 1973, the quality of this picture is outstanding.  Although it is dated, it still has to ability to scare....or disturb the viewer a bit.  I was VERY pleased with this movie.  To watch it all over again, with a few scenes added back in, was amazing.  The spider-walk is a MUST SEE!  I watched this movie after dark; perfect atmosphere to a wonderful movie.
6305949980|5.0|Amazing animation, funny, if not a bit morbid songs.
6304779356|4.0|I LOVED this movie as a kid.  Definitely dated, but still a lot of fun.  Just image.........moving to a strange new town in sunny California........only to find out the new gang that you're hanging with are a bunch of teenage vampires!!!!  This is such a cool movie.  The soundtrack is awesome; it fits the movie perfectly.  Not a bad transfer to DVD either!
B00005ASHM|5.0|I was a late bloomer and didn't discover this gem until last year. The songs are all brilliant, especially &quot;I'm Waiting For the Day&quot;, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Caroline No&quot;. If you are new to the Beach Boys (I was a year ago!) this is a good place to start unless you want to start with their early surf music first that you may already know and then hear the more mature stuff later. I'll admit it took a while for me to get used to this. The first listen to &quot;You Still Believe in Me&quot; had me scratching my head. It's just incredibly original. I used to think of &quot;California Girls&quot; and &quot;I Get Around&quot; when I thought of the Beach Boys so I was simply in awe that they did anything this artistic. Jimi Hendrix was known to knock the Beach Boys, but in all his greatness he can't touch Pet Sounds. Give it a few listens and you'll understand. These aren't songs, these are mini-symphonies that will blow your mind.
0792835077|4.0|Mixing in the Hollywood idea of the Old West with the typical sci-fi theme of Man-versus-technology, WESTWORLD, the directing debut of noted sci-fi writer Michael Crichton, is hampered to an extent by its low budget and somewhat stilted dialogue. Its premise, however, accurately described as a dry run for the author's later JURASSIC PARK, clearly makes up for whatever holes there are.<br />Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are the two businessmen who pay $1000 each to visit Delos, a futuristic theme park divided up into three sections, each depicting a different time in history: Roman World, Medieval World, and Westworld. The two men choose the latter, which is basically a recreation of an Old West setting circa the 19th century. They enjoy nights with hookers, get to play local marshals; and every so often at the bar, they'll get to shoot a robot gunslinger (Yul Brynner, in a malevolent take on his role in the 1960 classic THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN).<br />But when a malfunction of unknown origin hits Delos, everything goes haywire. Brynner, who once was programmed to lose every gunfight he ever instigated, instead turns life into a hair-raising ordeal for our two protagonists. Brolin is shot and killed, for REAL this time, on Westworld's main street; and then the film develops into an elongated chase for Benjamin, who, despite running as fast as he can, still cannot totally outwit or outshoot Brynner. Only when Benjamin finally pours corrosive acid onto Brynner does the robot gunslinger disintegrate into a jumbled, burning mass of wiring and metal.<br />Crichton's approach to some of the action scenes involving Brolin, Benjamin, and Brynner early on invoke similar gunfights in Sam Peckinpah's 1969 western epic THE WILD BUNCH, complete with slow motion and bloodshed (indeed, WESTWORLD almost got an 'R' rating from the MPAA ratings board). Then, when Brynner urges Benjamin to &quot;Draw!!&quot;, the film takes a terrifying turn. The chase sequence through Delos' underground corridor is well worked-out by Crichton and, albeit unintentionally, was paid a loose homage in the final part of HALLOWEEN II.<br />WESTWORLD joins the ranks of such technologically-minded films as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, and indeed JURASSIC PARK and A.I., in asking us to consider the possible implications of Man becoming dangerously hypnotised by his own creative ambitions. On that score, this is an extremely effective and frightening film.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I was lucky enough to read the script for this before the film was even shot and I was excited about it before it even came out. I was simply amazed at how beautiful this film came out. The photography was breath-taking and Russell Crowe was perfectly cast. This is no-doubt the film he'll be remembered for as this one did for him what Titanic did for Leonardo DiCaprio. The real star of Gladiator however was Joaquin Phoenix. He was one of those villains that makes you almost want to root for the bad guy. This film was a breath of fresh air. See it as soon as you can unless you can't stomach violence. Hollywood proved it still can combine entertainment with art if it really wants to bad enough.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This CD is amazing!!! Great, great musicianship, deep grooves, fantastic melodies! Prince and drummer John Blackwell are tight (...) on this CD together. On The Rainbow Children, Prince is a REAL musician throwin' down REAL grooves and crazy funk and gorgeous ballads. Prince needs to \\"give it up\\"?? Listen to \\"She Loves Me 4 Me\\", and tell me the man who created that simplistic beauty needs to stop making music!!! Go to his website for a full download of the song, from start 2 finish. It's so wonderful, you'll come back here and order the CD afterwards, I guarantee that!!! U gonna be tired after \\"Everlasting Now\\" finishes, it's so funky!!! It's like being at his concert, hearing a brand new funk jam blown into your face!!<br />So throw The Rainbow Children into your CD player, (...)you're going to feel a big electro-funky shock!!!
B000002546|5.0|it's about 1980, and I'm working the vampire shift at a local free-format radio station.  I play the grooves off of this one, because it's hot.  The tracks get into my veins and make my blood smoke.  Well, maybe not.  Hey.  I was a child of the 60's, and Jeff Beck was earlier a member of one the seminal bands of my generation.  At any rate, I love this album.  Diamond Dust is the best track on the album.  Maybe one of the best tracks of all time.  And listening to it again, it stands the test of time.  You want to update your old vinyl collection?  Buy this on CD.  Sounds just like being there.  You'll never regret it.
0060976624|5.0|I was delighted to discover Christopher Buckley.  His satire is dead-on and laugh-out-loud funny.  I've enjoyed &quot;Little Green Men&quot; and &quot;Wet Work&quot; just as much.<br />For anyone who's tired of waiting for Carl Hiaasen's next book, you'll find Mr. Buckley just as entertaining - and more topical.
B00003CXRM|4.0|As with all Coen brothers movies, it is off-beat and unlike anything else out there.  Those that don't appreciate the Coen's will say 'thank god', but for those of us who look forward to anything they come out with, it is worth seeing.  I'd put it a notch or two behind Fargo, but Clooney, Turturro and Blake are all great.  Clooney as the silver-tongued lawyer wasting his insights on his fellow escaped convicts with a combined IQ in the single digits.  It's not standard Hollywood fare, but it is entertaining, funny throughout and the music is enjoyable.
B00003CX5P|5.0|We already know the movie.<BR>So, I won't say much about the movie.<BR>Great special effects, but in general I found the movie not so captivating either.<BR>Anyway, the DVD is excellent.<BR>Especially the documentary was great. It made me to like the movie more. As I am a huge Ewan McGregor fan, I was so happy to see him behind the scenes.<BR>For those who already like the Star Wars Episode 1, the DVD will be a great pleasure.
B00005QCYD|4.0|In JURASSIC PARK 3, Dr. Alan Grant is paid by an adventurous couple to take them on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna, the island where the rest of the Jurassic Park dinosaurs remain. The plane ends up crashing, and the group becomes stranded on the island, and they have to figure a way to survive the dinosaurs and make it back to civilization.
B00002E224|5.0|this is seriously my favorite movie of all time, it has been since the first time i saw it years ago, i've watched it over and over, it really makes you think, you have to pay attention to what they're saying to get eveything you can from this movie, the most beatiful movie i've ever saw
B000000645|5.0|This is the third album recorded by the Incredible String Band, recorded in late 1967 and released in early 1968, at the height of the psychedelic movement in popular music.  Combining instruments and melodies from the far corners of the earth with lyrics unequalled in their day (and rarely since) reflecting on eveything from humankind to the natural world, from love to violence, from ancient mysticism to modern realities, the ISB made music like no one else.  It spoke -- and still speaks -- to the heart, the soul, the mind and the body.<br />The album begins with a trio of Robin Williamson compositions, extremely varied in their presentation, but all tied together by myth.  'Koeeoaddi there' mixes images from Williamson's childhood, including imaginings, songs and games shared with his playmates, with memories of adult neighbors and even a group of soldiers who camped nearby.  These variegated visions are pulled together by the chant that becomes the refrain: 'Earth, water, fire and air met together in a garden fair -- put in a basket bound with skin.  If you answer this riddle, you'll never begin'.  The following song sounds almost like something out of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan (complete with a responsive chorus and much humor), with a jarring difference -- its subject is the minotaur of ancient myth.  There's a brutal play on word sounds at the end of one bridge:  '...his habits are predictable, agressively reliable, poor bull'.  The third track, 'Witch's hat', is quite simply one of Williamson's most beautiful songs.  The visions his words invoke are dark and crystalline, fog-shrouded shapes moving in the woods -- the stuff that scares the hell out of kids and grown-ups alike, but beautiful at the same time.<br />The album's longest composition, Mike Heron's 'A very cellular song' follows.  It's a tour-de-force, encompassing several styles of music and themes -- including a West Indian funeral song.  His subject is nothing less than the beauty and nature of life itself, told from the level of a single cell.  This has been singled out by many reviewers as not only the high point of this album, but of the band's career as well -- and to be sure, from this period onward, it remains one of their most adventurous, popular pieces.<br />Heron's 'Mercy I cry city' is next -- a simple man's troubled view of the confusion we call 'civilization'.  Humor and innocence play large roles in these lyrics, as in several of Mike's songs over the years (check out 'Cousin Caterpillar' on their WEE TAM/THE BIG HUGE).<br />Another trio of Robin's songs follow.  The first of these, 'Waltz of the new moon', incorporates spiritual images from China, India and the Nordic countries of Europe into a swirling tapestry.  Dolly Collins' harp and harpsichord arrangements of this song are especially beautiful.  This piece flows effortlessly, seamlessly (and appropriately) into the next tune, 'The water song', another of Williamson's most moving pieces, an ode to the beauty, energy and sacredness of water itself.  &quot;Three is a green crown' follows, a beautiful but separate companion to his later work 'Creation' (on CHANGING HORSES), with many mystical references to the process by which the earth was formed, and life appeared and progressed.  This is a very hopeful song (I believe), encouraging us to learn all we can about the earth and each other -- through knowledge and understanding will come peace: '...the book of life is open to us, there'll be no secrets between us'.<br />Mike Heron's 'Swift as the wind' is next, in which a child's nightmare visions are scoffed at by his parent -- but the child senses how real they are, and the fear and dread he feels are very real to him.  'Nightfall', a Williamson composition concerning the power of the night and of sleep itself, end the album very fittingly:  'O sleep come to me, you who are night's daughter, and I'll give you my eyes for the colors that rise as time's echoes reflect on your water'.<br />The moodof this album is a little darker than some of their other effots, but I certainly don't see it as dismal or depressing or doom-laden.  Our days on this earth are made up of dark as well as light -- and there is knowledge and power in both.  The more we know, the more we open our minds and hearts to the night and its mysteries, the less we need to fear them -- as in the mysteries of life itself.<br />'Nightfall -- o river of sight flow through me, washing thoughts of the day on your waters away...for the morrow that dawns never knew me'.of this album is a little darker than some of their other effots, but I certainly don't see it as dismal or depressing or doom-laden.

Mr.Poe a kind man takes them until they find a relative that they can live with.Mr. Poe works at a bank. They have to live with a relative because that's what was said in their parent's will. Then Mr.Poe finds a distant relative named Count Olaf. They think it would be better then living with Mr.Poe but, they were totally wrong. When they arrive at his house his door has a eyeball carved into the middle of it. They look at him carefully. He has a tatoo that is the same design that was carved on the door. The author says in one part of the book that first impresions are almost alway wrong but the Baudelaire children were absoultely correct.They think he was a horrible man and he is. He gives them one room and one bed. Violet and Klaus take turns sleeping in the bed and Sunny sleeps in a bed of curtains that Violet makes for her.<BR>     This book is awfully good. Read it!
B00005KHJR|1.0|Wicker Man is a highly under-rated study in modern witchcraft.  It is the most accurate representation of &quot;the old religion&quot; a.k.a. druidism and is the complete antithesis of WICCA.<br />But onto the product itself.  It is hard to believe that a Limited Edition of a DVD could actually be worse than the VHS version. In fact it is worse that seeing it on broadcast TV, circa 1970.  How they could have trashed the video quality is beyond me.<br />The &quot;Limited Edition&quot; includes a wooden boxed set of two DVDs. One containing a wide screen version, and the other is in broadcast TV format.  Since the  difference in formats is about 10%, it isn't worth the bother.<br />Get the regular DVD, or even better, get the VHS.  You certainly won't get a better product by spending more money.
B00003CXXP|5.0|First and foremost, don't listen to any critic's opinion, or the opinion of any disgruntled friend that might have stumbled upon the film. This is a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; film, with little room for middleground, and you will not know where you stand until you see it for yourself. Do not judge it without viewing it.<br />That said, A.I. is a visually spectacular, emotionally moving, and mentally arousing tale about the quest of a little, unloved robot boy programmed to love the programmer. When David is shunned by the world he was born into, he embarks in a journey of great physical, emotional, and temporal expanse to find the only thing he was ever programmed to want. While the story itself is entirley original, in essence it is a futuristic portrayal of the fairy tale Pinocchio, complete with the mysterious blue fairy. Plot aside, the movie is expertly crafted in the hands of Spielberg and his actors. Spielberg seamlessly meshes futuristic sci-fi style with fairy tale sentimentality to create a visually rich and captivating future that deserves nothing but the most earnest praise. The actors bring this world to life brilliantly, most especially Haley Joel Osment in the role of David. The weight that this role carries is astounding, something I wouldn't entrust to some of the most skilled adult actors. Yet Haley is without a doubt one of the most talented actors to grace the scene, age be damned, and he gives the role the infinite, nearly impossible justice it deserves. Rock on Hailey, rock on.<br />Like many viewers, I watched the last half hour through a filter of tears despite my noble efforts to restrain an emotional outburst. The last 30 minutse are so angering, heartbreaking, and beautiful, and the characters so real, that it's difficult not to feel for them. The entire movie is one emotional rollercoaster, at times terrifying, beautiful, humorous, and haunting. Certain scenes will stick with you for life.<br />Never before has a movie inspired so many questions about the nature of humanity, love, and reality in my mind - it had me pondering for weeks. What responsibility DO we hold to the things we create? This question, while intriguing, also serves as a subtle warning. A.I. is so epic in scope, so deep with meaning, and so rich in talent that it merits saying that anyone who dislikes this movie has failed, truly, to understand it.

B00003CXDG|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. The action is non-stop and the acting is great. I must admit that I've grown fonder of it after watching the special features on the disk. That Tom Cruise did his own stunts -- WOW!<br />I liked the first MI but this one has more of the formula that worked in the original series. Whereas in the first one Ethan kind of caves in when his team gets destroyed (which is something an agent would never do in the series -- they always kept their cool even in the gravest of situations) this one keeps to the original's portrayal of the agents -- calm, cool and collected no matter what.<br />If the action/love interest doesn't get you then the special effects surely will. One of my favorites is the making of the knife up to Tom Cruise's eye -- very intense...
B00005QK3W|3.0|Paul McCartney is back with his latest effort &quot;Driving Rain&quot;.  I know this will sound sacrificial here but since Wings, McCartney has been slowly losing it in the music arena.<br />From The Beatles with &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot; to Wings &quot;Take It Away&quot;, &quot;Jet&quot;, &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot;, the latest lacks some of the hook flavor that McCartney has given us for almost 40 years.<br />&quot;Driving Rain&quot; is a good album that does get better as you listen to it.  It grows on you like a fine wine.<br />It is well produced, written and there are some standout cuts such as &quot;Spinning On An Axis&quot;, &quot;Heather&quot; and &quot;Lonely Road&quot;.<br />McCartneys vocals are in fine form as well showing he still has what it takes.<br />&quot;Driving Rain is a good album with a good effort, but definitely not up to the scale of the Beatles or Wings days.<br />But compared to all the garbage some artists are churning out these days &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is a welcome sight, just not a WOW! THIS IS THE BEST I EVER HEARD!.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Well, Madonna has done it again.  With so many albums on her belt, she has succeeded in putting together another greatest hits compilation.  Personally, having the &quot;best&quot; songs together in one album has its upsides and its so much easier to carry than a set of six cds.<br />However! Madonna should follow-up on her You Can Dance! compilation and remix the greatest hits she's done for the dancefloor.  Who would not want to buy a CD inwhich the remixes of &quot;Music,&quot; &quot;Deeper and Deeper,&quot; Vogue,&quot; &quot;Nothing Really Matters,&quot; &quot;Express Yourself,&quot; &quot;Justify My Love,&quot; &quot;Erotica,&quot; &quot;Beautiful Stranger,&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; are re-mixed into a seamless 75-minute 11-track cd.<br />Definitely good for business! Definitely good for the &quot;older fans.&quot; And definitely more money for you Madonna.<br />Are you listening?
1567184855|5.0|After more than 30 years of searching, searching, searching..finally to pick up a book that warms me from the inside out.  I have four grown children, and I have purchased copies for each one.  I have let it be known that of all the books that I own, (over 200)..this is the one book of all of them that I would save in a fire.  It feels like Truth, coming from my very Being.  I cannot describe how this book touched me. Skeptics will find flaws; intelligentsia may question.  But the Heart knows.  This is Truth.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|First of all. This album is nice. You can stick it your player and let it do its thing. Trust me, unlike a number of releases from Prince, you won't be hitting the fast forward button on this one. 'the Rainbow Children' is a very chilled out peace of work. It isn't 'Purple Rain', it isn't 'Sign of the Times', but at the same time it is 2001 (how boring would it be if Prince was still churning out neo-'When Doves Cry tracks' 16 + years after the originals release?).  In recent years it has been hit and miss with the AFKAP, my bad Victor, sorry Prince's releases. This one is a hit. Quit complaining and enjoy an increasingly rare musical moment.

B00000BKDY|5.0|I took &quot;Best of the Beast&quot; out of the library to give myself a reason not to like Iron Maiden (don't ask me why) and with tracks like &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; and &quot;Rime...&quot; I was just staggered at the energy and musicianship of this outfit - I will gladly defend them on these grounds to anybody.  Oh, the Wasted years I've had not knowing this group.  I am further amazed at their consistency.  But this album is the most solid of the lot - it gives you that thrill you get to be able to enjoy a whole album at a sitting and it's that effect which sets it apart.  Each track builds as it goes along.  Yet it is beautifully understated.  For the record, I hate &quot;Bring your Daughter&quot; and had long been put off the band by macabre album covers or subject matters.  But call this fun and shock value if you like, I know it's no laughing matter and evil often has a fair face.  &quot;Somewhere in time&quot; is however, in some strange way, free of this stuff for the most part.  I'm not trying to be judgmental but nor am I letting myself be non-judgmental - at the end of the day Iron Maiden aren't wise to joke or play around with the spirit world as a subject (see Seventh Son) but the vast majority of their repertoire in their hey-day is on good subject matters and is exceptionally briliant and great fun music.  Buy this. Buy it.  Go On. Go on go on go on!

B00005Q4CS|1.0|Ten billion cuts with the same in-your-face imagery, possibly the worst acting job of all time (Leto, et al), and a self-indulgent sense of its own alleged &quot;brilliance,&quot; this worthless tripe was possibly the biggest scam in cinema over the past several years.<BR>  I have never finished watching a movie in a such a state of anger at having been duped, conned, and beaten with the pretentious stick so mercilessly.  Many have hailed this monstrosity as &quot;compelling&quot; and &quot;disturbing.&quot;  The only thing that is disturbing is the fact that this crap is considered cutting edge independent &quot;art.&quot;  <BR>  Why people? Why???  Why have you been convinced that if you just hack away in the editing room, show drug usage, and go for pointless shock value that that somehow qualifies as deep, meaningful art?  There are so many great alternative and independent films out there, and this is not one of them.  This is a colossal work of crap.
B00000AFDW|1.0|It seems that Simmons/Stanley have become so full of themselves at their advanced ages that they now believe that extremely weak songs by the 2 of them (Just think \\"Hot In The Shade\\" or any of the other embarassing efforts on their collective parts) are much better than anything Peter or Ace may have to offer.  In fact, this whole album feels like Paul & Gene saying, \\"Ace, Pete -- we have the power here, & we're still (...).  Our songs are far superior to anything you have a part in, and we're REALLY Kiss, not you!\\"<br />Wrong, fellas.  Dead wrong.<br />Ace's sole contribution, \\"into the Void\\" is light years beyond the rest of this (stuff).  Granted, Pete's song (as sappily penned by none other than Paul) is not good, either, but wouldn't it have been nice to get one last classic KISS album as opposed to Gene/Paul scraps?  Guys, you ain't the band by yourselves, no matter what you think.  (...), the 4 of them didn't even play together on most of this album.  Even a (bad)effort by all 4 throughout would have somehow seemed fulfilling, in a weird, disjointed sort of way -- at least they would have failed as KISS (more Frehley would have prevented this fate, I assure you) instead of Simmons/Stanley's musical rummage sale, which was the product that we actually got (Ace & Peter are FULL members, guys, whether you like it or not).<br />I grew up a masive, worshipful fan.  As I get older, the egos of Stanley/Simmons now overpower what might have been an awesome finish to one of my favorite bands of all time.  Don't waste your $$$ on this disc.  Buy some classic Kiss & wait for Ace's next solo instead.  When they were a band, they (were great).  Now, as a simple, corporate entity dominated by 2 bitter members who refuse to forgive & forget, they just (are bad).
B00005QW5X|5.0|&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; bursts onto the screen with a ferocity and rock-and-roll energy not seen since the great rock operas of the 1970s. Not only can it claim to have taken &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;'s crown as the best cult musical of all time, but it's also one of the best musicals ever put on film. It is second only to another movie musical that was released this year, &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot; What do these two films have in common? They are both rock operas about people trying to find love. And that is where the similarity ends. How fitting that in the year 2001, the movie musical genre, which many have considered dead for the past 20 years, can be revitalized and reenergized and deconstructed by these two brilliant productions.<br />&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; is, ostensibly, the story of a gay man, growing up in East Berlin in the days before the Wall fell, who reluctantly agrees to have a sex change operation, so that he can marry an American G.I., and leave for America. Unfortunately, the operation is done incorrectly, leaving Hansel, now Hedwig, with a one-inch mound of flesh where his male member once was. As if that was not enough bad luck for her, her new husband, soon after bringing her to America, leaves her for another man. Hedwig is left high and dry, the very week that the Berlin Wall is torn down. &quot;Good things come to those who wait,&quot; says the television announcer. This inspires Hedwig to go on a journey of self-discovery; to discover her other half, her soulmate--but is it a man or a woman? And where does she fit in, in the grand scheme of things? Is she meant to be a male, as she was born, or a female, as she became?<br />That is when we, the audience, realize that this is not merely a simple story of a down-on-her-luck drag queen trying to make it in the Big World. This is a film about the search for the Platonic ideal, blending the mythic and mundane into a fascinating exploration of what it means to be complete. Is Hedwig's mother right in saying, &quot;To be free, one must give up a little part of oneself&quot;? Or is Hedwig's lover, Tommy Gnosis, when he tells her that &quot;there's no mystical design/no cosmic lover preassigned&quot;? The film uses the Berlin Wall as a symbol of the division between two soulmates. Hedwig believes that no one is complete until he or she has found his soulmate. Once they are reunited, one has finally found oneself. Like Berlin finally reunited, Hedwig longs for that herself. <br />&quot;Hedwig&quot; plays like a cross between a documentary-style film a la &quot;This is Spinal Tap,&quot; an MGM movie musical, an episode of &quot;Behind the Music&quot; (including tabloid covers and a clip of Hedwig on &quot;The Rosie O'Donnell Show&quot;), and &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot; But it is so much more than that, based mostly on (1) its use of complex symbolism and mythical allusions and (2) the brilliant, heartfelt, funny, and sad performance of John Cameron Mitchell, who wrote, directed, and starred in both the original off-Broadway production of &quot;Hedwig&quot; and this film. The man is a creative genius and should receive a Best Actor Oscar nomination.<br />And what of the music? Simply brilliant, as well. &quot;Hedwig&quot; boasts, bar none, one of the best rock opera score of all time, except for, perhaps, &quot;Rent.&quot; The music is raw energy incarnate. The melodies are amazingly tuneful, and range from hardcore punk to rock n' roll, to folksy, to soft, but never overly sappy, ballads. The lyrics are a revelation: more mature, nuanced, and finely tuned than any songs you are likely to hear in any other Broadway or rock venue. And, yes, contain a great deal of mythical, literary, and even biblical allusions. <br />The musical numbers are staged brilliantly, particularly &quot;Wig in a Box,&quot; my favorite song in the film. A grungy trailer opens up and transforms itself into a beautiful, shiny, brightly colored stagefor a great rock number. It's flights of fancy like this that make &quot;Hedwig&quot; so much fun.<br />The film also contains amazing work from its supporting cast, including Miriam Shor, playing Hedwig's husband, and Andrea Martin, playing Hedwig's publicist. <br />If you are looking for a rock musical that really rocks, but also has a very complex, multilayered, thought-provoking story under its shiny, glitzy veneer, look no further than &quot;Hedwig.&quot; And you might want to consider buying the soundtrack, as well. The songs are impossible to get out of your head, but in a good way. <br />And I didn't even get to mention how hilariously funny the film is, as well. You will laugh long and hard; you will find yourself singing along to the music; and yes, you'll also find yourself extremely touched.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is the best new artist I believe I have ever seen. He has a voice somewhat like Dave Matthews and the melodies remind me a little of David Gray. He is a fun artist to listen to. Give him a chance, you wont regret it.

0451169514|5.0|&quot;The King of Horror&quot; produced his finest tale when he wrote IT.  Impressively long at 1000+ pages, King takes his readers on a thrilling joyride back to the wonders and terrors of childhood.  Like no other living author, King remembers what childhood consisted of and has the uncanny ability to recall it for us in all its intensity of conflicting emotions.<BR>   The plot of this novel is straightforward.  Set in 1958, 7 children must face down an almost supernatural evil which they come to call IT.  Able to take on the aspect of each person's worst fear, IT mostly sleeps only to awake every 26 or 27 years to feed on the children of Derry.  After a series of adventures, the children battle IT to a draw.  27 years later, as adults, they are recalled to Derry to once again do battle with IT's ancient evil.<BR>   King interweaves the events of the present day with those of 1958.  His characters ring completely true, although they are more vibrant as children than as adults.  The various subplots and adventures experienced by the children (the apocalyptic rockfight, dam-building, movie-going, Silver, to name a few) enhance the verisimilitude of the story.  <BR>   I must caution you on two things.  1st, there is a sex scene late in the book that many will find offensive.  While integral to the plot, King could have developed a less viscerally offensive avenue for his characters' escape.  It is King in his &quot;if I can't get terror, I'll take horror, and if I can't get that I'll go for the gross-out&quot; mode.  2nd, I am one who equates the name of Stephen King with the term &quot;finest living author&quot;.  His work, while at times crude, even gross, has the depth and vibrancy of the best of Dickens.  No stylist he, but a storyteller without peer with an uncanny ability to delineate character with a few sentences.  This is his finest work.  Read it.
B00005B4GU|2.0|Radiohead's latest studio effort, Amnesiac, is a watered down mess of an album. All of the insanity of Kid A is present, maybe even more so, but the musical structure and focus is long gone. <BR>Personally, I really enjoy the early efforts of Yorke and the boys such as The Bends and OK Computer. I really love guitar driven rock, and few alternative bands do it better. Or should I say, &quot;Did it better&quot;...<BR>Then came Kid A. An album that I love and admire, simply because the sounds, though not 'rock', persay, are beautiful and mad, just like the worst moments of life. It was an acheivement that no other recording artist accomplished that year. So, obviously, when the band announced that their new album was going to be more familiar ground, ala The Bends, I was thrilled. But, instead the album they delivered was inconsistent and messy. It was the lesser parts of all of their efforts put together. If people thought Kid A was abstract, they had no idea what Amnesiac was going to be. <BR>Though, the album as a whole is a disaster, there are some very fine moments. &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; is a fabulous rocker with haunting vocals and scary moods. &quot;Knives Out&quot; is another gem, with a kind of bar band feel. But these alone seem to be the high points. <BR>Hopefully, Radiohead will decide something a little more conventional for their next outing, because when Radiohead does conventional they do it wonderfully. The abstract, chaotic techno music worked for Kid A, but try number two was a waste.
B000002JSJ|3.0|Although 1979's In Through the Out Door would truly be their fall from grace, the erosion of the seminal hard rock band and kings of the post-Beatles rockworld, Led Zeppelin, starts with 1977's Presence. Unlike In Through the Out Door, an ill-fated synth-rock experiment, Presence does not suffer because of a dramatic change in Zeppelin's formula. The album merely suffers from a lot of sloppiness (\\"Tea for One\\" and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" are otherwise fine returns to Zeppelin's bluesy roots that are prolonged way past their due) and a drop in songwriter quality (\\"Candy Store Rock\\" and \\"Hots On For Nowhere\\" are little more than banal pop tunes).<br />The circumstance under which it was recorded may account for some of Presence's rough edges. Leadsinger, Robert Plant was recovering from a horrendous car accident. Guitarist, Jimmy Page was succumbing to heroine addiction and drummer, John Bonham, had found his own vice in alcohol. Plus, a deadline forced the band to hurry the recording. Thus it is understandable why Presence is the sound a band surviving were they used to flourish.<br />Still, an echo of a great band is better than being the epitome of an average one and Presence has its moments. \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" features Page's best guitar-shredding since 1969's Led Zeppelin II. The frantic \\"For Your Life\\" and the hilarious \\"Royal Orleans,\\" about bassplayer, John Paul Jones' misadventures with a dragqueen, capture a fine slinky groove. The album's prime is, of coarse, \\"Achilles' Last Stand,\\" perhaps Zeppelin's finest epic. Unlike previous blockbusters like the folky \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and the Middle Eastern-flavored \\"Kashmir,\\" \\"Achilles' Last Stand\\" is not a masterpiece of disciplined riff-exploitation and graceful arranging; it is pure surge. With hard, heavy guitar lines and Bonham's most feverish, colossal drumming, the band scorches through the ten-minute tale of mythic anxiety and adventure.  Because of the gorgeous \\"All of My Love,\\" In Through the Out Door's highpoint, \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" would not be Zeppelin's last masterpiece, but they play as if it were. Obviously the gust that made Led Zeppelin great was still with them. But circumstance had obviously eaten away at their guile, making it is evident that the legendary rockers were out of their prime.
B00005QDW5|4.0|This two disc set is a great compilation album, with a few exceptions. These exceptions are the cutting-short of the songs &quot;Echoes&quot; and &quot;Shine on you Crazy Diamond&quot;. I don't really like all of the songs they picked, such as the song &quot;Bike&quot; because that is not the Pink Floyd sound that I know. It just sounds too oldies. Other than that, the album is great and if you are a Pink Floyd you should definitely make this a part of your CD collection. You won't regret it.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is a great CD. I am so impressed with ALL of the producer collaborations. The Prince song truly rocks! You can &quot;hear&quot; that they had a great time making this album which is the biggest factor in why it is so great. It's the type of CD you can listen to at work a few times a day and absolutely not get bored with it.
B00005B36H|5.0|I admire Tool a great deal. In the face of Pop/Rock; a culture inhabited by rapping whte guys with guitars, macho lyrics, and turntables - they still manage to make adventurous rock albums in the vein of Zeppelin. Their albums are extremely epic. You'd feel as though you were cheating yourself out of the experience if you only listened to one track. That's why Tool works so well. Not only do the tracks themselves rock, but the entire album mixes together so well, that you barely notice  that the track changed. <BR>For example, the couplet Parable and Parabola; I had not realized that they were two different tracks until I read the back of the cover. I thought it was just one great epic masterpiece of a song, which it really is. I doubt the band would play one without the other. <BR>You can also tell that blood, sweat, and love goes into everything they do. This is an album of their craft, a guidebook for other bands to learn from. If only ALL bands were this adventurous in this day and age. Pop culture would be far more open-minded. When Tool bows out, which I hope is a long, long time from now, they will have a catalogue of Masterpieces that few bands could ever hope to gain. It goes to show what time and effort will bring.
B000002JSN|4.0|Led Zeppelin has always been grandiose rock. During their dominance over the post-Beatles rockworld, the British bluesrockers raised hard rock to a new level of screeching commotion and the rock epic to a new level of majesty. But their lack of humility was agreeable because the band always had the bite to back up their thunderous bark. Robert Plant's banshee wail, Jimmy Page's guitar shredding, John Bonham's maniacal drumming and John Paul Jones' confident bassplayer and arranging were always bold, graceful and inspired enough to not only justify, but require, such unprecedented boisterousness.<br />1975's Physical Graffiti is the most ambitious album Zeppelin ever released. The hard rock gods filled the double-LP to the brim with all the energy they had and every style of which they were capable. The album is laced with high-octane poprock, playful folk, spitfire blues, and high-flying blockbusters. With the exception of the long-winded version of the traditional number, \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" never on these four sides does the band create an uproar unless they have a worthy riff to exploit (\\"The Wanton Song,\\" \\"Houses of the Holy\\"), texture with which to experiment (The Middle Eastern flair of the classic \\"Kashmir\\" the delicate waviness of \\"Down by the Seaside\\") or neohippie spiritual musings to wander (\\"The Rover,\\" \\"Ten Years Gone\\" with its seminal lyric \\"We are eagles of one nest/The nest is in our souls.\\"). With Physical Graffiti, Led Zeppelin setout to create a spectacle and, without sounding pretentious or desperate, they succeeded stunningly.
0812550706|5.0|I usually read fantasy (Brooks, Jordan, etc), but when I read this, I was hooked.  I've read it a dozen times and it gets better every time I read it.  This is the ONLY fiction book on the Commandant of the Marine Corps required reading list.  It should be on everyone's required reading list.
0440213525|4.0|I have read two of Grisham's books before this one, The Testament and The Firm, and this one is just as entertaining.  It starts off with the young but wise character of Mark Sway who has a lousy home life.  One day, he and his brother stumble upon a man trying to commit suicide in the woods and Mark tries to stop him.  Unfortunately for him, however, he learns too much in the process.  Because of this newly obtained information, he has a dangerous Mob member hot on his trails.  This murdering criminal wants the boy to keep quite while authorities want him to tell all.  Caught in the middle with no way out Reggie Love, a sassy lawyer with spunk, guts, and determination, tries to bring this case to safe ending.  She lays it all on the line.     <BR>The plot starts off quite exciting in the beginning but varies in intensity throughout the whole novel.  At times, the pages can go on about legal matters and be slow to get through, but before you know it, it has suddenly picked back up to its exhilarating pace.  I think that this book is so much fun and easy to read because of its fast tempo.  Things happen so quickly that you can't put it down.  Also, I think the characters in Grisham's works are all very realistic and their actions are relative to the way most of us would react in their given situations.  This, too, is another reason why Grisham keeps bouncing back with success upon success.  He has all the key ingredients that would appeal to all readers.  This is a book you should not pass up on the shelves.

His all words made me think about many things, include this life,friends,love,family..etc. He's very inspiring person.. I don't think that I could ever meet such teacher like him...(well....probably it's just possible...hopefully:) I have some favorite professors though hehe;)<BR>Thank you for great job Mitch Albom:)
B000002J0B|4.0|On Led Zeppelin's four previous records, the seminal British hard rock band was satisfied with a rotation of grinding hard rock and eerie, acoustic folk. 1973's Houses of the Holy finds them expanding their repertoire and experimenting with new textures. The band applies a lush, warm ambience to the magnificent \\"The Rain Song.\\" They channel the dark, whisky-drenched ambiguity of the latter Doors records on \\"Dancing Days.\\" Guitarist, Jimmy Page abandons his tight, thrashy riffs for loose, wavy fuzz on \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" and the windy, progrock-ish epic, \\"No Quarter.\\" Zeppelin even lace their sound with a slightly offbeat reggae fusion on \\"D'yer Ma'ker\\" and with complete wacky funk on \\"The Crunge.\\" Obviously, Houses of the Holy's experimental spirit causes it to loose the impressive consistency of Led Zeppelin's previous albums. Still, it is well worth noting for the many trials which thrived (chiefly \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" \\"Dancing Days\\" and \\"Over the Hills and Far Away,\\" a delightfully melodic track that wavers between quaint folk and hard rock like a sunny \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"). By this time, Led Zeppelin had already proven they could balance their neohippie and hard rock personas superbly. They were ready to loosen their sound and blend it with a cornucopia of their favorite styles. Houses of the Holy producing enough shining moments for their experimentation to compensate kindly.
0451191153|2.0|From the first fifty pages of the book, it becomes obvious both what Rand's politics (regardless what you may think about them) and how she will promote them.  Specifically with obsurd liberal/leftist sterotypes that allow her to push over.  From the professor at the books start who promotes the absolute perfection of the &quot;classics&quot;, to a &quot;liberal&quot; populus who aparently accepts no deviation from the status quo, this book is an exercise in strawman politics.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I hate to say it, but this is definately No Doubt's worst album. While the beat is good and the sounds popping, there is too much of the &quot;hook&quot;. In fact there are several songs that have nothing but the hook. &quot;Making out&quot; is the same 17 second melody played over and over again for 4 minutes and 16 seconds. In other words you hear the exact same thing 15 times without interruption. In fact tracks 4 through 11 are basically the same thing. It is reall a shame about these songs since they all could have been really good had they just had some more changes and lyrics. There are a couple of really good songs on the album though, First &quot;Waiting Room&quot;. This was done with Prince, and has a great sound. &quot;Hey Baby&quot; is also a good song, which most people know by now. Finally, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; the title track isn't too bad. <br />Overall, the album is not worth the money, but some of the singles are. I also would love to hear some of these songs &quot;revitalized&quot; and put on later albums, I think many of them could be #1 hits if they just had some more changes in there.
B00005OM5L|5.0|If you are a guitar fan, your jaw will drop at the &quot;Five Long Years&quot; solo. The DVD has two songs that the VHS does not, Hoochie Coochie Man and It Hurts Me Too. The former is nothing special (far superior version can be viewed on The Crossroads Concert DVD), but It Hurts Me Too features EC emotively playing the slide and is definitely &quot;value added.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.
0385505833|5.0|I hadn't read a Grisham novel in quite some time, even though I knew he was a good read. So when this came out, I picked up a copy to renew my \\"relationship.\\" So glad I did!<br />This is a quiet little book, with a simple story and a great payoff. It's an easy read, too. The thing I like about Grishom's writing is that he doesn't flower his prose; he says what he has to and gets out. And, this book indeed helped put me further into the Christmas spirit. It is a warm, humorous and \\"cute\\" book, highly recommended! A very nice job!
0060977264|1.0|Damn.  How come only the LAMEST metaphysical books make it big?  Yeah, I get all that stuff about the hundredth monkey and how the pioneers get all the arrows, etc.  So I take it that the message is that women have to support their man in fulfilling their man's destiny?   Gee, that's a new idea!   (...) <br />That's what the author neglects to tell you--that men only exist because our creator realized that women, although polarized, aren't polarized enough to have the impetus to return to androgyny and complete this experiment.  Hence, she has men on the scene with all of their maternal angst to get the job done right.

He returns to his home to find it destroyed and his family dead.

0385505833|1.0|I know that John Grisham is a very thoughtful writer, and I have enjoyed reading all his previous books.  This one intrigued me because one of the reviewers indicated that the couple who decide to skip Christmas finally discover the true meaning of the holiday in the end.  Don't make the mistake I made...  there is precious little that this couple discovers about anything in the end!  There is no character development anywhere.  In &quot;The Testament&quot; Grisham gave us a taste of someone who truly goes through a transformation, and I was hoping there would be something of that sort in &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot;  No such luck, this book's tone throughout is nasty and demeaning, which some people could call sarcastic, but when that's all you have, it's really not worth reading it--the last 2-3 pages did nothing to redeem the rest of the story.  Sorry, John, but you can do, and have done, so much better elsewhere!

6305358567|4.0|This baroque offering tells the tale of how the embattled Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) - a Protestant princess in a catholic court - rose to become the queen of England in name and deed.  The story opens with the impending death of Mary, Elizabeth's Catholic half-sister and the reigning ruler of England. Religious persecution of Protestants includes burning at the stake - an horrific display at the story's start.  Unable to stave death or produce an heir, Mary paves the way for her half-sister's ascension - even as she condemns Elizabeth as a bastard.  Crowned queen, Elizabeth is hardly secure in her position.  With Catholicism dominant, English Bishops side with Rome, Spain and France against her, undermining her authority and preaching against those who would rise to her defense.  Outwardly, they urge her marriage to any one of several suitable suitors - foreign born Spanish or French princes.  On her side, Elizabeth's resources are meager - the kindly but ineffectual Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) , the passionate (perhaps too passionate) Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) and Sir Francis Walsingham (Jeffrey Rush, helping make this look like a \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" reunion) as Elizabeth's warrior-assassin.  With Papal intrigues linking Rome to the insidious Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), and a military threat posed by the formidable French war-mistress Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardant), Elizabeth's tenure seems doomed from the moment of her coronation.  Instead, her headstrong resolve (and Walsingham's clever moves) secure her until she can consolidate her rule.  By the end of the film, already the target of numerous barely botched assassination attempts, Elizabeth emerges corseted and whitened, a virtual living ghost who held the throne for the sake of England but lost out on love and her own security.<br />This is a great film, but mostly because of Cate Blanchett, who seems regal even when (especially the early part of the flick) when it's clear she doesn't know what she's doing.  She can be funny (telling the Bishops that it doesn't matter which suitor of France or Spain is superior - she'll simply marry both), but never above letting everybody know who wears the crown. Jeff Rush is also great as her Elizabethan-era mentat.  The story however is weak - it seems that Walsingham manages to do what he can because, despite his notoriety, there seems no shortage of victims willing to let him come close enough for the kill.  Elizabeth's consolidation itself culminates in a purge of Catholic subversives led by Norfolk, but that requires some explanation because such a purge would require the sort of substantial support that Elizabeth clearly lacked.  The relationship between Walsingham and the Queen is also understated, possibly because it would complicate Elizabeth's relationship with Dudley.  Still Blanchett carries the film, helped by excellent cinematography which creates an England shrouded in gloom.
B000002KKD|5.0|Unbeknownst to the majority of people, a satellite manned by an Athens, GA quintet detected the next The planet's name?

The real surreal line that really caught me: \\"We were at the beach/Everybody had matching towels.\\" If the B-52's played a party by the ocean, mermaids, fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, lamellibrates of all shapes and sizes would show up to boogie.

B00005QDW1|2.0|Let me just say off the bat that I love No Doubt.  I think Gwen Stefani rocks, and both Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn stayed in my CD changer for about a year.  So I was super excited to hear new material, but wow what a disappointment.  If you just play the CD as background music and not really pay attention, then this CD is actually pretty good.  But if you stop and listen, you realize that every song is comprised of a 10 second snippet repeated about 40 times to make a 4 minute song.  If you haven't heard the album yet, you probably think I'm exaggerating, but I swear I am not.  I really thought there was something wrong with my CD player or the CD until I skipped to the next track and encountered the same thing.  If this sort of thing doesn't bother you, then any No Doubt fan will like this CD.  For me, however, it drove me absolutely insane.  On every song, I found myself saying: &quot;Please please for the love of God, say something else Gwen!!!&quot;
0201633612|5.0|This book helps those less-experienced with OO design to see the true power of OOD, most notably polymorphism and decoupling.  I thought I understood before, but I now have a much better understanding of the usefulness of interfaces and upcasting, and why composition is often a better solution than implementation inheritance.  <br />I chose to read this book while I was learning Java.  For me, it worked well to read one pattern per day and try to get the most out of it.  Reading several patterns back to back will likely get exhausting for most.  The presentation of the book is very conceptual and academic.  Even ten pages of reading may fill your head for a while.  So be warned that you will not likely knock this one out in a couple sittings!<br />This book also provides the reader an education on the importance of patterns in general.  Although the current world of web services and stateless objects will deemphasize the usefulness of some of these &quot;classic&quot; patterns, the IDEAS layed out in this book (interfaces, layers of indirection, etc.) will hopefully help all of us discover next generation of patterns.<br />My only wish is that they would come out with a new edition of this book that:<br />a) Documents code in Java (those not knowing C++/Smalltalk may struggle)<br />b) Chooses less technical examples (e.g., a pattern demonstrated on a payroll application instead of a compiler subsystem)<br />c) Updates to the current version of UML (although the current modeled documentation is not bad)<br />d) Provides new patterns that help people with wireless, Internet, web services, stateless objects, etc.<br />e) Changes the tone to be a little less academic (this is really just a nitpick)<br />All in all, this was a very useful book and was worth the brain strain it required to read and grasp it's concepts.  It has aged well despite being written prior to the WWW becoming a household word.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Like most opera lovers of the last 40 years, I have grown up listening to Joan Sutherland's recording of bel canto operas. And, like most opera lovers, I have never failed to be impressed by her phenomenal technique. However, unlike most opera lovers, I have never found hers to be a particularly attractive voice. To my ear her tone is too thick, her intonation too murky, and her top notes too strident to be totally enjoyable. An evening of listening to her was like sitting down to eat a giant bowl of clotted cream, tasty at the beginning but altogether too rich to finish. Now, I know this will be considered blasphemy by many of her fans but consider where she started. Miss Sutherland had basically a big voice and her career seemed to be settling in on late Verdi, Wagner, and Puccini roles when Bonynge discovered her and nurtured her into a bel canto specialist. To his mind, there were already lots of Nilsons and Tebaldis out there but very few sopranos to follow in the footsteps of Callas. Since Sutherland possessed the range and the flexbility to sing the bel canto repertoire, he nudged her into that arena. And she was his willing protege for most of her illustrious career. But, I feel that many sacrifices were made for the sake of pure beauty of tone. As well, it was a case of taking a basically large voice and, by necessity, holding it back to allow for the vocal pyrotechnics dictated by the likes of Donizetti and Bellini. As a result, although she could sing this repertoire, she always sounded too heavy for the roles she was portraying. That is why this recording was such a revelation for me the first time I heard it. Here, Dame Sutherland is allowed the chance to really open up her voice and avail herself of its full potential. And she shows us that she possessed a very thrilling voice indeed. She has no problems with the tessitura of this most cruel of soprano roles and her voice easily soars above orchestra, chorus, and tenor! Away from Bonynge and all his stresses on achieving &quot;perfection&quot;, Sutherland is able to cut loose and reveal a dramatic side that is hidden in many of her other recordings. Just listen to her delivery of the passage after Calaf correctly solves the first riddle as &quot;Speranza&quot; or &quot;Hope&quot;. She sounds like an absolute fury and, were I Calaf, I'd turn and run for the nearest exit! Mehta urges her along and backs her up with a powerful, tightly dramatic reading of the score. Her conversion after receiving her first kiss is completely believable and never fails to bring tears to my eyes. And this from a soprano whose death scene in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; always impressed me technically but left me cold dramatically. One only wishes she were given the opportunity to delve into more of this type of &quot;heavier&quot; repertoire because I feel it is where her voice was truly most comfortable. This recording has to be one of the best ever committed to disc with strong performances from all involved. At this point in his career, Pavarotti owned this role and with good reason. In his prime he possessed one of the loveliest tenor voices of this century. He was another singer prone to be undramatic but Mehta manages to coax a highly charged performance from this superstar. Caballe was always one of the most tasteful and discreet singers. Her performance as Liu is completely heartbreaking, even though she may sound a bit mature for the role of the young slavegirl. Nonetheless, her death scene is one of the great moments in recorded opera. The rest of the singers are uniformly fine. So is this the recording of Turandot to have above all others? Definitely!! Not only because it is a shining example of Puccini opera, but because it gives us a chance to hear a different kind of Joan Sutherland. One who is free of textbook delivery of bel canto style and can just pour on the sound and thrill us with what turns out to be one of the most beautiful voices of our time, after all.

The worldwide fascination with Santa Claus is timeless, and it's nice to have a movie that actually focuses on him, as opposed to his being a mere backdrop(the only other movie to accomplish this feat being the wonderful Miracle on 34th Street).<BR>This movie does have its very vocal detractors, and to them all I can say is Bah Humbug.

Whether you're 3 or 93 if you have even the slightest bit of Christmas spirit you'll find something to like in this movie.  Well worth it
B00004XONN|5.0|Daring, intelligent, and beautiful. Frightening and profound. Radiohead composes the most creative album I have heard in a long time with &quot;Kid A&quot;. Those of you out there who criticize need to listen closer. The most important element to good music is passion, and &quot;Kid A&quot; offers this in many ways. The detachement and darkness, power and desparation expressed in this album is so thick you get lost. Within the album's cavernous, jittery, sometimes flowing and anthemic melodies you find a refreshing look at progressive rock.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I bought this cd on a whim knowing nothing at all about Tom Waits.  So when I put this in my cd player, I had no idea at all what to expect.  From the first second this played till the very end, I found myself completely enraptured by each and every song.  There is nothing on this album that disappointed me in anyway and I have since began to order and search for his other stuff.  This guy is a true artist.  He sings from the heart in his unusual, compelling voice I am now addicted to.  I just find it sad that it took me this long to discover his music.  His words are incredibly brilliant as he tells each story.  I can honestly say I loved each and every song.  Discovering this album proves how much one can find when they delve into music not played on the radio.  This shows how incredibly inferior mainstream music can be.  Simply put, I loved it!
0790751089|5.0|This movie was just so good! I loved Ms Streep's flow in her acting and Mr. Eastwood was able to keep right up with her. His performance was achingly real and very intimate. This is definately a romance, not a romantic comedy but a full-blown romance, with great actors. The love scenes just seem so honest and poignant. I usually do not feel as tuned in to key romantic scenes with older people, it is usually more with your Brad Pitt type or younger adults, but this movie wipes them all away. The scenes sizzle, and I mean sizzle! The ending is very intense and can bring up some strong emotion for those of us out there who are sensitive! The bridges are beautiful and have prompted many to visit them. I don't rate many movies a 5 star, so be prepared for a good film! Warning, some may not be so entranced with it because it is an intimate sensual experience as opposed to high action and suspense. Not to say either is better or worse.<br />Lisa Nary

B00000I8UF|5.0|Too many musicians of vision and great skill have died in their prime.  Brownie, Booker Little, Bird.  But to me, the greatest loss was Lee Morgan.  He may have been in the middle of a spiral into mediocrity at the time of his death, but on 'Moanin' and 'The Big Beat', the next album by the Jazz Messengers, his gutsy, masculine lyricism and musical pyrotechnics reach their apex.  On Along Came Betty, the graceful, insinuating walk of this woman lilts on the round melodic tone of Morgan's horn.  Though firmly in the hard bop tradition, Lee Morgan can rhapsodize with the very best.  As Leonard Feather observes in the album cover notes, Morgan's wit is apparent in the manner he ends the first two choruses of his solo, but I think Morgan is remembering Betty (or some other lady) with knowing wisdom. This Betty will get the best of anyone who crosses her path.  'Moanin' is the album that established Art Blakey as the premier band leader of the Blue Note label.  No jazz collection is complete without it.

B00003CXXJ|2.0|I expected this film to be clever and witty, more like Toy Story or Antz.  I don't see the difference between this and many of the weak comedy entries this year.  This felt like a studio trying to break in to the smart funny Pixar world, and failing.  After Prince of Egypt I expected something classier and better quality than this dreck.  I can't believe this was the highest grossing movie of the year.  And even worse- critics have given it high marks!  I just don't get it.
B00005QDW1|5.0|1. intro - very good idea, it's cool because now they can bring a theme to their world tour. they can put it on and we will all freak out and then theyll come out and play. it's cool. not quite reggae but it's got an island/carribean kind of feel to it.<BR>2. hella good - what can i say? the guitar intro reminds me somewhat of their earlier material, the vocals are playful and fun, it's like hard rock but with a dance feel. i played it and my friend neal was like &quot;that is rad.. who is this?&quot; and i told him &quot;no doubt&quot;, needless to say, he can't stop listening to his copy either.<BR>3. hey baby - liked it from the beginning, it's just a fun song and although i couldve used a little more guitar i do like the bass, the drum loops, and the keyboards. am i the only fan of bounty killer? i think he adds a lot to the song and is a credit to dancehall as a whole.<BR>4. making out - it's a very good song. i'm not sure if its like funk or rock or what? it's a strange mix of a lot of stuff. also reminded me a bit more of their earlier material with an electronic edge. lots of sounds i can't even describe. very unique and innovative.<BR>5. underneath it all - because it was just released, i dont want to be over zealous and say that it's the best ballad they've ever done because i dont know that it could be considered a ballad but there is genious in the simplicity. dont get me wrong, i like their other ballads, but this is laid back, heart felt, i like the groove, the horns are rad, it was well written, lady saw was born to be in this song, and it's the best reggae they've made to date. reminiscent of sublime had bradley nowell been a woman.<BR>6. detective - it's really good. i like the acoustics that are played behind the song and the layers of vocals. they are kind of hiding in the back but theyre very distinct. most of the song is really rad but at times i wonder if the song couldve been better if they had done normal vocals on the chorus instead of thosehigh ones. at the same time, theyve got a good effect because it sounds like a scary childrens nursery rhyme which is what they were going for... something new to the band, but hopefully something they dont leave out on their next record.<BR>7. dont let me down - i loved this song from the beginning. this is a classic no doubt song. i think the lyrics are really good, i can relate to them, and i like the balance between guitar, drums, and keyboards. this track stands out a lot to me for some reason. i think it's because i can really relate and because it's distinct no doubt. nobody else really sounds like this and that is the likeability of the band. i want to meet ric ocasek and shower him with praise for his production on this song.<BR>8. start the fire - very good. i like the bass on it a lot. the keyboards are also VERY good. and then at the end i like how theyve got some vocals dubbed in. i like the way it sounds like it was non chalantly recorded at the end where the music is just playing and theres the moans or whines. i cant tell if its high pitched keyboards or if thats actual horns or if they recorded horns and messed with them in pro-tools. either way it sounds really good... another song that reminded me of a sublime/no doubt hybrid.<BR>9. running - can we say trio's &quot;da, da, da&quot; meets the pretenders &quot;ill stand by you&quot; mixed with classic no doubt? it's got this rad keyboard intro which then goes into the song. i like the lyrics again on this one... &quot;im so sorry that ive fallen help me up lets keep on running... dont let me fall out of love&quot;. great imagery. it's kind of a new wave ballad. it's really good. very positive too. i'm so glad the ballads on this album have got some positive lines in them and it's not all about babies, carriages, getting dumped, or being heart broken. the band shows their evolution in this beautifully orchestrated song.<BR>10. platinum blonde life - everyone says it, and everyones right. it soundsreminiscent of garbage. it's good though. no complaints here. i like the chorus and the guitars on this one.<BR>11. in my head - one of my favorite tracks ever. i wish i was a millionaire because then id buy the band and make them be in my video for it. i feel like i should be walking on stilts through a circus filled with freaks of nature, demented clowns, distorted animals, and an insane ringmaster. it's just so strange but really good.<BR>12. waiting room - its sexy. this sounds like something timbaland would produce because its just got a very erratic and peculiar beat. on my first few seconds of hearing this track i thought the album would finally have it's flaw because it sounded almost too different from their other material but then as the song got a few more seconds in this song quickly became another standout track. it's worthy of being played in clubs worldwide and is absolutely brilliant. has gwen stefani ever been so playfully sexy before? <BR>13. rock steady - it sounds like what id listen to on the giant escalator into heaven. its a good song to close on, and a good theme for the album. its chilled out and concludes the rollercoaster that is ROCK STEADY.<br />this album is great and should not be passed up by anyone who likes to have fun, listen to more then one type of genre, or wwants to hear something new from a band that has been around for so long. you can tell a great deal of effort and work was put into this album because it shows. i can't wait for the next rrecord... this band never fails to surprise.
B00005QW5X|5.0|&quot;Hedwig and The Angry Inch&quot; is without doubt one of the best films ever made. Imaginative, intelligent, thoughtful, extremely witty, very moving, and BIG FUN, &quot;Hedwig&quot; is everything a film should be -- and it should be required viewing for all Earthlings! Don't overlook this film -- it has the power to transform lives! So long as John Cameron Mitchell and Steven Trask are in it, there is hope for the world!
0671004107|3.0|It's important to not draw any conclusions about this book till you've finished it.  So many questions are addressed, and so many different philosophical points of view presented, it's tempting to try to second-guess the author's own perspective on the question of extraterrestrial intelligence.  Specifically, did Carl Sagan believe in God, or not?  But he doesn't truly reveal himself till the last few pages.  And it's worth the wait; the story's closing is very satisfying.  One caveat:  The book can get pretty bogged down in the development of too many characters.  I myself only really cared about Ellie Arroway and Palmer Joss.
B000007177|5.0|A great listening collection &amp; a fitting way to top of my JT collection. Some of the last few tracks on side 1, definitely ended up on TAAB. <BR>(Other reviewers' comments of this work say 'it all'. A real must for the JT fan.)
0743420373|4.0|This book was actually very intersting.  It had a lot of information, and I, at times, found myself, overwhelmed, but it never once got boring.  On every page there was a new fact, something cool or interesting about the millionaires of our country.  Whoever knew that the people who spend the most on cars aren't actually the richest people.  According to the book, most millionaires aren't austentatous about their wealth.  Lots of them drive not BMWs or Mercedes, but Fords and Volvos.  It's very intersting how you really can't judge a book by it's cover, even when money comes into play.  I really liked this book, but I found a lot of it to be repetitive. In the first chapter, it's all broke down for you-how to become a millionaire.  And it's simple-spend money wisely, and be sure to save it.  That's what will get you there, keep you a PAW, instead of a UAW.  It gives good tips on how to treat your children, how to play the stock market, how to buy a car etc., but it really kind of passed me over.  THus stuff doesn't really mean anything to me, especially in high school.  However, in a few years, I will defintely pick this book up again and make sure I pay attention.  But for now, it's just interesting and fun.  Great book!
B000001Y79|5.0|I just bought No Doubt's new album &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and it doesn't even compare to this classic. If you are into punk/rock music you will love this album like your mother! There is truely not a bad song on this album! This was the album that made No Doubt famous. If it wasn't for songs like &quot;Don't Speak&quot; or &quot;Just A Girl&quot; there would of never been &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot; with Eve and Gwen Stefani (Gwen part of No Doubt) or &quot;South Side&quot;, want me to continue? Ok anyways, if you don't have it. GET IT!!! Here is a list of the songs with up to 5 stars on acording to wether i like them a lot.<br />1. Spiderwebs ***** CLASSIC!<BR>2. Excuse Me Mr. ***** <BR>3. Just A Girl ***** CLASSIC!<BR>4. Happy Now? *****<BR>5. Different People *****<BR>6. Hey You *****<BR>7. The Climb *****<BR>8. Sixteen ****<BR>9. Sunday Morning ***** (50's)<BR>10. Don't Speak ***** CLASSIC<BR>11. You Can Do It **** (Disco)<BR>12. World Go 'Round ***<BR>13. End It On This ***** <BR>14. Tragic Kingdom ***** (Kinda X-Files Theme)<br />This album is worth all the money in the world. Even if No Doubt never makes another good album I will always look back on this classic and say &quot;THEY ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DAMN GOOD!&quot; You are really stupid if you don't buy this. Most of the songs are 5 stars, meaning it is good!!! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!
B00003CX5P|4.0|A lot of people give this movie way too much ... complaining that the characters were flat or thrown at us too fast, or Episode I should have totally set up the grounds for episodes 2-6. Look at it reasonably! You can't expect George to give us EVERYTHING in one movie, what would be the purpose of Episodes II and III? I think a lot of people are missing the main purpose of this story: Anakin's first meeting with Obi-Wan, Palpatine's beginning's, and Anakin meeting his future wife and mother of Luke and Leia. A lot of things point to the fact that there won't be a huge span of years between Episode III and Episode IV, that's why there wasn't a huge amount of development in the first one. So come on, give the movie a chance, yeah Jar-Jar may be annoying and I can say I preferred Queen Amidala's pre-release voice (heard in the teaser trailer) as opposed to her present voice in the movie, but hey, Episode II takes place a decade after Episode I and since Jar Jar isn't in the original trilogy we can trust the fact that he's going to die at some point, hopefully sooner than later, and that's my two cents.
B000053VAF|3.0|Ok, there are a few things that save this movie. The cast, the jokes, and the fact that Smith made it. But it pales in comparison with his other films, like Chasing Amy and mallrats. Dogma is funny and all, but it goes a bit to far sometimes. The hole bash the bible plot gets tiresome, but Jay and Silent bob are still lots of fun. If oyu are a die hard Kevin Smith fan, then you might like it a bit more. I found it tiresome and annoying, but Jay and Silent Bob are funny!
B000002B9I|5.0|This is the best spanish CD EVER I recommed it you wont be dissapointed.
0385505833|1.0|As I was reading this depressing, stressful book, I couldn't help but think about what people outside the US must think of us and the way we prepare for Christmas.  Everybody was so mean to each other or envious.  The Krank marriage was a bore.  Their lives were so mundane.  I especially hated the stressful times the Kranks had as they were preparing for their daughter's arrival.  Did the mother make the caramel pies or not???Fortunately I rented this book from the library.  Has John Grisham had a lombotamy?
0440217563|5.0|I love Diana Gabaldon.  I loved Outlander but was left a bit disappointed by Dragonfly in Amber.  But of Voyager?  No way.  It is satisfying in almost every respect.<br />What did I love about this book?  I loved that a significant part of it explores the lives Claire and Jamie led without each other.  You feel sad for them, especially Jamie, who cuts a rather tragic romantic hero.  Their reunion scenes were wonderful.  I loved how this book covered so many storylines.  When I got to the end, I could not believe how Diana Gabaldon had packed it all in!<br />A really satisfying read.  I have two more in the series to go and then like the rest of the Lallybroch universe, I must wait for the next (and sadly final) instalment.  This voyage was one hell of a ride.
B00005QDW1|5.0|The 21st Century's answer to Fleetwood Mac, by way of Blondie and Madness, are back with this, their finest, most comprehensive collection Pop. Actually, calling this album &quot;Pop&quot; would defeat its very purpose: &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is a one-CD jukebox of sublimely catchy Post-Punk, tipping its hat towards Dub, Dancehall, synth-friendly 80's Pop, Electronica, lithe R &amp; B, and even elements of Tropicalia. It's a VERY pretentious album, if you haven't noticed by the absurd hype, the flaunted phallanx of celebrated collaborators/producers, and the fact that, nowadays, Gwen seldom wears anything that doesn't have the album's name emblazoned on it. Nevertheless, notwithstanding my distrust of the industry-manufactured hoopla, I do believe the band pulls it off nicely, crafting what I feel is their most complete album to date, topping both their previous (increasingly better) efforts. If &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was their &quot;Rumours&quot;, and &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; their &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; seems to be more complete, versatile and canonical... Gwen Stefani has practically grown into the role of SoCal's chic-est chick, much like previous LaLaLand queens Stevie Nicks, Exene Cervenka, and Belinda Carlisle, all of which (along with some Debbie Harry) Gwen echoes in &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. The album's main shortcomings, which are mainly of the lyrical variety, are emphatically overcome by the obscene amount of hooks, and by the band's sheer professional playing within the sheeny production values of Spike Stent, The Neptunes, Sly and Robbie, Ric Ocasek, and the great Prince, whose contribution to the album, &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, can best be described as deserving of &quot;Sign O' the Times&quot;, complete with Sylvester-like harmonies and backing vocals by His Royal Badness himself. Ric Ocasek's deft touch with synths and guitar riffs lends a little bit of &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; to &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and especially &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot;, while Sly and Robbie submerge &quot;Underneath It All&quot;'s lyrical shortcomings under the deluge of Tony Kanal's bass-playing. Blondie's &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; seems to be a huge influence here, although THAT album spawned most of what No Doubt seems to be drawing on here, hence Blondie's greatness... However, the fact remains that there is nary a truly &quot;bad&quot; song on this album, most of which is treated as a comprehensive whole, ill-served by the invariable Greatest Hits compilations t which will follow in the next decade... In this day and age of pre-marketed paup, of thirty dozens of Orlando-bred and fed teenieboppers with no musical inkling or touch, and of twenty-five interchangeable (mediocre) rappers and Angry White Men Who Want to Rap... bands such as these, who play and write hook-laden Pop/Rock rooted in the canon, deserve high praise. High praise, indeed.
6302636779|4.0|At first,it seems it's gonna be an austere movie due to the theme(religious life in the thirties).But if you are patient,this story should win over because it's treatment is first rate.As usual,AUDREY is excellent as SISTER LUC who gradually after many experiences decides to quit religious life.PETER FINCH as a surgeon in CONGO has one of his best early role.Based on a true story,the film tells it's tale the way it must be tell,without fancy camera work.You should enjoy the second half best.It was AUDREY HEPBURN's second dramatic part after her bad experience in WAR AND PEACE.Even if times and religious life are not to be judged by today's standards,this film makes it clear that you enter this kind of life at the own expense of your true nature.Of great interest if you have someone in your family or a friend living this kind of experience.
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is a tense, taut, psychological thriller that is intensely gripping.  Brad Pitt plays a new New York City detective, David Mills, who partners up with a grizzled veteran ,William Somerset,  played by Morgan Freeman.  Somerset is leaving the force, but Mills persuades him to on for just a little while longer to investigate a bizarre murder case set around the seven deadly sins.  The victims have no clear connection to another and the detectives keep coming up with dead ends in their investigation.  Mills is a hothead, who is impulsive and Somerset is exacting and thorough, a voice of reason. After finally finding the killer's apartment, the killer appears and gets into a chase sequence with Mills through the apartment building and out into a driving rain.  It is a superb cat and mouse chase scene with the killer escaping but not before he smacks Mills around with a tire iron, puts a gun to his head before sparing him and fleeing.  (...)  The final scene played out in a deserted field outside NYC provides a shocking and disturbing finale.  Mr. Pitt is at his best as the Mills, but Mr. Freeman commands the screen with his icy cool performance.  Gwenyth Paltrow has a small, but pivotal role as Mills' wife and Richard Roundtree has a brief appearance as Mills and Somerset's department head. The film has some gory and graphic scenes that might turn some weak stomachs, but it has everything you'd want from a thriller:  mystery, suspense, a great plot, great acting and a great, shocking and surprising ending.
B00004Z459|4.0|I mustsort of agree with you that this is a bit of a mix of different types of music and that it is a little bit watered down. Buit let no one thats really listened to it can say all the songs sound the same or that they're pop or what ever your saying. First of all, like all the bands now or sorta mixes of different types of music (like rap-rock or poppish punk)but weren't you people getting tired of the same thing(even though real rock is good) I personally like rock but variation is good. And what is elling out to you people now. Are all the bands U don't like sell-outs? One of the only things I can think that of thats worst than truly selling out(like REAL pop bands) is not listeniong to music you like becausew people said they're sell-outs. I say people should just listen to what they like and not give anyone else a bunch of (...)about it.
B00003CXXS|1.0|The title speaks for itself. This movie is very,very bad. Don't waste your time on it. The new director did a really reall bad job with it. Not only was i dissappointed, everybody i've talked to said it stinks to. i would of maybe given the movie a C tell the ending. (...) So i ask nobody to ever buy this film.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is flawless. Every song on the album is great. I listen to it more than any other album that I own, and i never get bored of it. It is a pity that Cobain wasted his talent and brilliance. The world of music will remember THE GREATEST GROUP OF THE 90's
B00005LOUP|1.0|I loved the book and the cartoon of the Grinch.  I HATED this movie.  I stared at my watch and hoped it would end.  We were with friends and couldn't leave the theatre. I would strongly recommend renting this before buying it if you haven't seen it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie was one of the best I had seen in a long while. The acting was good and the comedy was subtle and funny at the same time. The music was terrific and added to the movie's charm. Anyone that enjoys folksy down home humor and music would love this movie.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I have several Earth, Wind & Fire records and CDs, and this is definitely the best choice! I have the imported Dutch Collection, which has all of their hits, but this is still my favorite!   It has so many great songs - this is their essential album.<br />This CD is great for anyone who wants EW&F's greatest hits, and the price is good, too. If I had to choose one CD, this would be it.<br />It could be better if they added Turn On the Beatbox, though...
B00004XQ83|5.0|Two things here. <BR>1.  If you don't like &quot;old&quot; country music, Don't even think about it.<BR>2.  If all else buy it for the song &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;.
B00003CXXS|4.0|To be honest, the third installment may be the best of the series.  The first film was good but succeeded primarily on oohs and ahhs and a few well placed tense scenes.  The problem with the first film was that it ran a bit long.  The second film's major problem was that the ending was forced and way out there.  This film succeeds because it makes no secret about what it is.  There is no deep plot here, although the major plot elements do work together (yes, even the ending works in the plot - remember that Laura Dern's &lt;Dr. Sattler&gt; husband said he worked for the state department).  It does stretch reality a bit, but it is a film about dinosaurs and action films tend to rarely resemble reality.  What this film is is fun.  There is hardly a dull moment.  I've seen the movie a couple times and still jump out of my seat, even though I expect the shock (might have something to do with the timing).  If you want a deep film with a complicated plot and intricate storyline then it would be best to stay away.  If you want an action film that will keep you on the edge of your seat and take you away from the world for a bit then, well, this one might be for you.  Not really a 4 star film; I rounded up.  3.5 stars.
B0000508U6|2.0|The only good tracks in this album are 'Trouble' and 'Yellow', and the rest of them are just boring fillers. I almost fell asleep by listening to this cd and the singer's voice starts to get really annoying and boring after awhile. by the way have I mentioned that all the songs on this cd sound the same? no, I haven't? well, now i'm mentioning it...
B00005QDW5|5.0|A &quot;Best of&quot; compilation is, by definition, limited.  For a band like Pink Floyd that produced a very large volume of very good work, any work of this nature will be missing great stuff.  If you want everything, buy all of the albums and quit your complaining.  For its intended purpose -- to provide listeners with a manageable package stuffed with Pink Floyd goodness from their entire career -- &quot;Echoes&quot; is fantastic.  It is easily the best compilation of its type I have ever run across.<br />First of all, the sound quality is UNREAL.  The clarity and fullness of the sound, even on the older tracks, is nothing short of unprecedented.  It is almost certainly a BIG improvement on whatever you heard before from Pink Floyd on old CDs, let alone radio or records.  &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; in particular sounds fantastic; the acoustic guitar lead-in to the song sounds almost impossibly clear.<br />Second, irrational whiners notwithstanding the track selection is very good.  The only omission that I missed was &quot;Mother.&quot;  The sequencing was quite good in my book, and the edits to some longer bits were done in a way to be completely unobtrusive to all but he most fanatical purists. <br />Third, there is alot of it.  You get about 150 minutes of music.  A nice big chunk of Pink Floyd, and we can all thank our deity of choice that they didn't try to go cheap with only 1 CD.<br />Fourth, they didn't omit &quot;One of These Days,&quot; the best hard rock instrumental ever.  Drive down the highway on a rainy night and crack this tune up to 11 and you'll hear what I mean.
B000056H5J|5.0|I love this cd it is a verry cool cd. I thought that I wouldn't<BR>like the whole cd but I do. It is a very neat cd. I love all of her songs. They are very soothing to listen to. It relaxes you when you listen to the songs.
6305622957|5.0|Okay, so my wife doesn't like the movie because the scenes involving the Japanese are subtitled.  To me, this is an absolute<BR>plus.  This motion picture highlights the Japanese planning and<BR>execution of the most brilliant wartime raid ever made.  It also shows an arrogant and somewhat disbelieving American view of the<BR>Japanese threat on the Hawaiian islands prior to our involvement in World War Two.  It is one of the best war movies ever made.<BR>The DVD version is greatly superior as it offers a widescreen<BR>view (as presented in the theaters).  Also, and as usual, the DVD version has an enhanced quality that is greatly improved over the VHS version.  This movie is captivating.  It grabs the<BR>attention, keeps the attention, and demands that it be reviewed<BR>again and again.  You will not be disappointed.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is easily the best film of 2001. It is one of the most breathtaking, heartwrenching, and exquisite pieces of film ever made. Filled with incredible music, mostly 70's and 80's pop songs, beautiful costumes, and perfect performances. Nicole Kidman is sensational and gives the performance of her career as the star of the Moulin Rouge. Ewan Mcregpr is so charismatic and likeable that you can't help but fall in love with his character.<BR>The two have wonderful chemistry and though they may not have the best singing voices they are good enough. This film has everything you could want. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you might even sing along. Incredible!
B00005QDW1|2.0|No Doubt's third LP, Rock Steady, finds the Anaheim, CA-based group moving away from their ska/punk/new wave sound into an entirely new direction, which is mostly hip-hop and reggae with a touch of dancehall and 80's new wave influence. It is obvious that Gwen Stefani's collaborations with Moby and Eve have influenced the band's current sound. It's nice to see that No Doubt are not afraid to evolve and experiment. However, the 13 tracks on this CD just seem like they are missing a little something. The upbeat tone of the album is likely to get some serious dancing going on, but the songs just don't seem very strong. The single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; has an infectious hip-hop beat, but that's overlooked by the repetitive chorus, which can grate on your nerves after 10 times of hearing it. Many No Doubt fans believe Return to Saturn was a step in the wrong direction for them. True, there were more ballads on that CD than in the past, but the songs were very cohesive and very catchy. &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; is the only track resembling the older No Doubt sound. If you are a die hard fan, you may enjoy this, otherwise, look to No Doubt's earlier work.
B00005QIPH|4.0|It's hard to scold these guys for being derivative, when they're deriving from the pinnacle era of rock'n'roll. That's almost like calling Jerry Lee Lewis derivative because he's influenced by Sam perkin's rockabilly.I'd rather listen to an Iggy pop Johnny thunders derived band than a Nirvana Radio head derived band any old day.
B00005QCVT|3.0|Well, to be fair, Mr. Arnofsky has a decent sense of compositional flow, and he's makes interesting, and fairly effective use of lots of neat-o camera/visual effects. Also, Ellen Burstyn puts on a great performance showing us the visceral, compulsive and paranoid world of a lonely substance abuser.<br />But that's just about it. This film is no more than a downward-spiral portrait of sad individuals who don't have the presence of mind to rise above their self-destructive habits ... There is not much articulation, subtle or othewise, nothing beyond stylistic moodyness (which it does at least succeed at) ...  There are times when you'll be gritting your teeth at some of the more miserable scenes in the film ... I personally walked away with a light case of nausea and a pain in my arm, but ultimately, it's not very fulfilling, poignant or innovative.<br />There are already a number of junkie films to be had out there, this one does little to stand out ... but there is the soundtrack, which by itsself, deserves good four stars (can't go wrong with the Kronos Quartet &amp; now I can't wait to hear more from Clint Mansell ...  FYI he should have a solo album coming out under Nothing records sometime in the near future).
6304913176|5.0|Ahh! Co-ed showers.  If only the real world was as enlightened as fiction can be.
6305508550|4.0|The funnier points of this movie are often the most subtle, like the bland dialogue, mannerisms and appearances of some of the characters.  I can't say I was in a rush to see this movie, I'm no Beavis and Butthead fan, so hearing &quot;From the maker of ...&quot; on the ads for this film turned me off to seeing it right away.<BR>But I must say, Mike Judge must know what it's like to be trapped in cubicle-ville.  Truly captures that stilted, HR-arbitrated atmosphere.<BR>Having both a particularly bad HR exec &amp; VP of engineering at my first job has helped mold me into the incredibly cynical young man I am today, making the humor here all the more accessable.<br />Those with similar experiences will be able to fully appreciate this movie.
B000002VSN|5.0|This is probably the most exciting album Whitney has ever recorded. Many critics were saying that she doesn't sing like she use to: However, anyone who listens to that crystal clear voice on the original version of &quot;I believe in You and Me&quot; would say that the critics are WRONG. The album is a &quot;feel-good&quot; for anytime of the year. My personal favorites are &quot;I Love the LORD &amp; My Heart is Calling&quot;.  Her mother also does an excellent job with the 23RD Psalms (W/ Hezekiah Walker's choir).  I would reccommend this album for anyone looking for peace and happiness.<br />I'm convinced that we still have not seen or heard the best work Whitney has to offer.<br />Enjoy
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus, who has been around for a number of years has an awesome and different type of music.  Lead singer, Brandon Boyde, along with 4 other [rockin'] band members have such a wide range of different type of music they are in a catagory entirely by thenselves.  I've been listening to Incubus ever since there first album and I must say this is the best work they have ever done.  The lyrics and music goes together in perfect harmony to create the band.  I highly recomember this awesome CD.  If your don't get it you'll be missing out on something so unique you'll fall in love with the first song you hear.
0425163407|4.0|you will like this book.  Dr. Kay Scarpetta is a medical examiner and FBI consultant.  She is witty, real and full of your typical character flaws.  She is also smart and knows her job well. Patricia Cornwell fills this book with fascinating crime scene and autopsy information that loses me while it fascinates me!<br />I found this book to be extremely interesting.  &quot;Unnatural Exposure&quot; is a quick moving page turner!  I had no idea who the killer was.  It was a good surprise for me.<br />This is my first Patricia Cornwell book and I am really looking forward to reading more of her novels.  This book is intriguing and I am eager to read more about Kay, Benton, Marino and Lucy.<br />In short - great book ... I recommend it with vigor!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the best cd to be published in years.  As far as I am concerned they put on the very best live show I have ever seen out of 50 major concerts
B00005QDW1|5.0|I was a bit disappointed after No Doubt's last album, but eventually liked it (it took awhile to grow on me). I always liked it when No Doubt had a lot of up-tempo songs instead of slow ones. This cd is just what I would have hoped for. No Doubt have returned to their roots, while changing their sound as well. There are a lot of electronic sounds in the album, and they complement Gwen's gorgeous voice perfectly. Here are the tracks: 1. INTRO: A brief excerpt of the chorus of &quot;Rock Steady,&quot; the last song. 2. HELLA GOOD: A great uptempo dance song. The Neptunes helped write this one. It is one of the best, probably my second favorite. 3. HEY BABY: The first single, this one actually took awhile to grow on me, but now I love it! Very infectious. 4. MAKING OUT: Another fun, uptempo track. Produced by William Orbit. Instantly likeable, I think this will be the next single. 5. UNDERNEATH IT ALL: A slower, reggae-sounding song. A little repetitive, but good. 6. DETECTIVE: This one's my favorite. It's really fun and instantly catchy. The chorus is so cool and will have you singing along. 7. DON'T LET ME DOWN: This sounds like it could have come out of the eighties. It is a really good uptempo rock song. 8. START THE FIRE: This is the only song that I don't like all that much. Another slow, reggae beat, and very repetitive lyrics, it's kind of boring. 9. RUNNING: This is a really cool ballad. It's very innovative sounding. The music, especially at the beginning, sounds exactly like the music to any of the old nintendo gameboy games, I swear! 10. IN MY HEAD: This is a really cool song and is funny to me for some reason. The beat is really cool. 11. PLATINUM BLONDE LIFE: This is the most hard-rock sounding song and is a welcome return to the sounds of Tragic Kingdom. It kinda sounds like something Hole would do. Really good. 12. WAITING ROOM: The is the one they did with Prince, and it's practically a duet with him. As a fan of Prince's, I really enjoy this song. It's just got this really slinky sound to it. Irresistable. 13. ROCK STEADY: This is a pretty slow song, and is very catchy. Not one of my faves, but good.                   ~ The cd's enhanced with the video for &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; a behind the scenes video, and a screensaver. Lyrics included.
B000003S0I|5.0|Larks is a fantastic recording made by one of the most creative guitar players in the 70s (even until now!). Ok that the album was made by huge contribution of the other members, but Fripp is the center of the paranoia generated by this recording ! Totally different from &quot;Islands&quot;, Larks showed us a heavy progressive, with a lot of great percussions (a gift of Muir, excelent musician. Unfortunatelly, we cant hear great percussion work in the 70's progressive albums.)abstract guitar works, growling bass and a gentle violin and mellotron. This line up, for me, is the best one of Crimsom. Wetton great vocals on &quot;Exiles&quot; and &quot;Book os saturday&quot;, and a great bass on the part one of the title track. Bruford (just before leaving Yes) is perfect, his work on Larks part two and &quot;Easy Money&quot; is memorable. David Cross is a refined musician with an excelent experimental feeling, thatjust fit perfect with Fripps trips ! His violin on Larks part one creates a really great texture. PERFECT !<BR>With this album, Crimson reached another level of musical perspective. For people who likes heaviness plus abstraction and harmony (is it possible?).
B000002NHN|5.0|This is the best of Loreena McKennitt's albums, in my humble opinion, and that is saying a lot because her albums are all startlingly, eye-popping, jaw-droppingly good; especially in a day of &quot;rap&quot; (which cannot even be used with the word &quot;music&quot; in a correct English sentence) and &quot;heavy metal&quot;.  To point out one cut as the best is foolish--can one choose among the stars of heaven?  But &quot;the Highwayman&quot; is particularly interesting because of what she has done: take a classic poem to which every child knows the words, and transform it into an epic ballad.  (She did this same thing with &quot;The Lady of Shallot&quot; and Tennyson can be only pleased.)  This took ART.  If you have never heard Loreena McKennitt, by all means start with this album.  If the music center of your brain functions at all, it will thank you.
B000000HTO|5.0|Im not a great fan of VDGG, but a listened to a great part of their records. The first albuns are a little bit confuse, experimental but really intense. My favorite one was always &quot;Pawn Hearts&quot;, a really great complex recording. When i bought &quot;Still Life&quot;, i thought that i was about to listen to just one more band that was trying to sunk their progressive vein, like Yes in &quot;Going for the one&quot; (altough it has some excelent tracks) or Genesis in &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot; (a record that shows Collins and Banks burning out the Genesis song slowly and painful !). <BR>I got extremely surprised by the songs present in &quot;Still Life&quot;. Hammil and the band with a very clear sound, beautiful and climatic lyrics and a new way to go on with VDGG work. They just &quot;reinvented&quot; their own sound, altough many fans prefer the first phase of the group. The title track, &quot;Pilgrins&quot; and &quot;La Rossa&quot; are good demonstrations of these new phase. Intense tracks, much more minimalistic than their late works. &quot;Pilgrins&quot; have interesting lyrics. &quot;My room&quot;, is one of my favorites. WONDERFUL melody, Hammil performatic vocals in a delightful way plus his sax interventions. Marvelous. The last track, &quot;Childlike Faith Childchood's End&quot; is quite a little confuse, the introduction reminds me their late works, the lyrics are very powerful, and, in the 13 mins lenght, Hammil shows that his work on VDGG continued precise, serious and provocative. The rest of the band are good too, including the organ, that are simple but atmospheric. A very nice album, not their best, but another VDGG artwork !
B00005QDW1|5.0|Gwen Stefani and friends are back with the brand new ROCK STEADY. After the flop of RETURN OF SATURN, No Doubt make it a point that they've returned to top form. ROCK STEADY is awesome! It's their best effort since TRAGIC KINGDOM (which is still an all time fave of mine). Gwen's never sounded better. She's back with her playful/clever (yet honest) lyrics (also co-written by Tony Kanal &amp; Tom Dumont) and quirky vocals. The vibe on here is FUN! It's a party album with a tropical/summer feel. It's upbeat and sonically satisifying. ROCK STEADY is filled with pop infused dance-hall/reggae, rock and 80's synth elecronica. No Doubt's most soncically daring album to date. This is an awesome blend and it's perfectly mixed. Producers include No Doubt, Nellee Hooper, William Orbit, and others. Gwen really got her fun, party/playful attitude back with this one. She also offers a sexy side on some tracks. ROCK STEADY flows very well with the uptempos but it also includes a softer side. Tracks like &quot;running&quot; are light and dreamy. Other gems include &quot;hella good&quot;, &quot;hey baby&quot;, &quot;making out&quot;, &quot;dective&quot;, &quot;rock steady&quot; and others. ROCK STEADY truly rocks -- no doubt about it!
B00005NWM3|2.0|... then you'll know what this sounds like. I mean, what the hell happened to the, they were already soft, but now??? Now it is a piece of modern rock bull[edit]. There songs are catchy, the lyrics (are bad),  all it is is N'SYNC on acid sorta like [st]linkin park. This [edit] is really starting to (get bad)...<br />-FM
B00005QZWI|5.0|I can't wait to see the scenes that go with this music.  Just hearing the music brings forth the emotions that I would place for the scenes they are supposed to be matched with.  Howard Shore is awesome!  He is now right up there with Hans Zimmer and John Williams in my opinion.
6303269826|2.0|Much of the movie is a snore...it might be more historically accurate, but doesn't compare to Tombstone in terms of entertainment value.  Buy this movie if you like the monotonous details of a history class, but not for the intensity that is so addictive in other movies.  Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday is particularly not worth writing home about, which is disappointing due to the very colorful nature of the real Doc.  Better to save your ($) and 3 hours on something better.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD (is great)!!!!!! It is a great cd! I listen to it every day. If you like the rockish type, this cd is great for you. When I first heard 'Crawling' is when I got hooked. I listened to my friend's cd of it and loved it!You NEED to buy this cd. It is GREAT!

Guaranteed   to touch you in the most meaningfull way.<BR>Thanks to the clever outrageous working habilities of Sam Mendes, he is capable of delivering a film so &quot;Powerfull&quot; that would make you look life in a different way. &quot;Beautifully!!!&quot;
B00005LB9O|3.0|This is a good album with some of the catchiest singles I've heard in a long time: &quot;Sing&quot; is just tops, I couldn't get that out of my head for a month after I heard for the first time.  &quot;Side&quot; is top-notch too.  &quot;Dear Diary&quot; is probably the most obvious reason why they get Radiohead comparisons.  It has a sparse arrangement, floaty noises in the background, and a Thom Yorke-espque lullaby style singing.<br />&quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; is a nice little pop tune, just some simple acoustic guitar strumming with very basic instrumentation...nice tune though.  &quot;Flowers in the Window&quot; sounds like a Beatles song.<br />All in all, this is a good album, its just not an outstading album.  I much prefered their previous record.
B0000033K2|5.0|This is WONDERFUL. If you're like me and you think John Coltrane was the most perfect realization of God's purpose when God invented music x thousand years ago, you will love this set. (If you don't already have it.) But even if you don't think that, you will probably like it an awful lot. It is simply jazz saxophone at its finest. And the high quality of the recording captures the music perfectly.<br />Even though it is seven discs, I've listened to it probably 40 times. Several entire albums are included here. Yes it's expensive, but if you buy one of the albums separately, you will want another, and another, and then you'll eventually buy this anyway. That's what happened to me.<br />Like liner notes? There is plenty to read in the generous booklet. Curious what songs were originally on what albums in what order? All that information is included here, along with original album artwork, complete session information, musician credits, etc. I am very picky about the way albums sound and the way they are packaged and I found no problems with this set. That is rare for me, people!<br />Usually when a record label says, &quot;The Complete...&quot; I think, &quot;sure...&quot; and then another album comes out with something they just &quot;discovered&quot;. But I think they did it right with this one and actually gave us everything! If you are at all into jazz, you will never regret buying this whole set.
B00005JKOV|4.0|When I saw this movie a month ago I was lured by reviews and a love of animation. As I watched the movie it initially reminded me of the intense philosophical discussions that are often induced by &quot;getting high&quot; and the freeform way that conversations seem to progress. While I agree with these favorable reviews, I did not at the end of the movie see these as random thoughts at all. The main character that appeared to be dreaming or waking through the movie by the end I was convinced had followed his life from a young age at the beginning, tracing the memories of his life, only to realize in the end that he was not awakening from sleep. Instead he was revisiting his memories before leaving earth, gradually letting go of his life &amp; body now able to accept his death. It was comforting for me to think that maybe this is the way it could be for all of us sooner or later... or maybe I'm just crazy.
B00005RIKD|5.0|VERY SELDOM HAVE A HEARD ANY RECORDING BY STING THAT DID NOT IMPRESS ME.  HE HAS A WIDE RANGE OF STYLE FROM JAZZ, BLUES, BALLADS, LOVE SONGS AND ROCK AND THIS CD SEEMS TO COMBINE ALL HIS TALENTS ON ONE ALBUM.
B000002J1S|4.0|I know I'll get tarred and feathered for only giving \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" four stars, but I just can't bring myself to give it more. This album is strange. Plain and simple. It's odd. And it doesn't really lend itself to quick, off-the-cuff listenings. This album was meant to be STUDIED.<br />I remember when I first heard The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway back in the mid '70s. I borrowed it from a buddy at school (he and his pals were into The Lord of the Rings and early Genesis, circa Lamb, and I wanted to find out what the deal was -- and how I could fit into that somewhat eccentric circle of friends). I took it home, waited until night time, went into my room, plopped Disk One onto my turntable, turned out the lights and nearly scared (...) myself. I've been stuck with that feeling of creepiness ever since! (Try listening to \\"The Waiting Room\\" in the dark, alone, some night if you doubt me.)<br />I'm not going to go into detail about what this story is about. (The Amazon.com reviewer already did an adequate job of that). Besides, I don't think anyone truly knows what this album is all about.<br />Here's my advice regarding \\"Lamb\\":<br />1. Don't listen to it in the dark alone.<BR>2. Don't start with this album if you're new to Genesis.<BR>3. Do expect a shocking experience.<BR>4. Do have a dictionary or compendium of contemporary pop culture beside you so you can understand some of the words and references. <BR>5. Do try to listen to it all at once, even though both CDs total about 95 minutes. (See #3.)<br />This album is still considered Genesis' high water mark, although I still prefer Selling England. This Lamb is a taste I'm still learning to acquire!
B00003CXXS|1.0|What a major letdown.  This is with out a doubt one of the worst movies ever made, and that is about the nicest thing I could say about this movie. There is nothing of value to even make this worthy of the previous two movies of the series, and there is nothing of value to even make this a decent film.  The acting is amateurish, the directing is disjointed, and don't even mention the script because there aren't one.  You can see how much Spielberg really cares about the fans if he green lighted this abomination. Do yourself a favor, and forget this one ever existed. One more thing, even thou The Lost World was not Spielberg's crowning achievement, it's still light years beyond better than this film.
B000002J1O|5.0|Steve Hackett told me once in an interview that this is his favorite Genesis albums. I wholeheartedly agreed. Selling England By the Pound, released in 1973, is a massive leap forward in both sound and song quality. Every song on this album is perfect.<br />&quot;Dancing With the Moonlit Knight,&quot; the opening track, begins with one of Peter Gabriel's strongest and most confident vocals. It's a lively track that blends equal parts guitar, bass, keyboards, drums and voice and contains enough memorable, clever instrumental passages to bear repeated listenings.<br />&quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; follows &quot;Knight&quot; and is clever, witty and musically creative. I always like listening to the opening line: &quot;It's one o'clock and time for lunch, When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench, I can always hear them talk...&quot; Boom. In come the drums...and the song takes off. (This track appears again on the essential live album Seconds Out and was to become a concert favorite.)<br />If you like beautiful piano passages, Tony Bank's intro to track 3 (&quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;) will please the heck out of you. It's great. And then the whole band kicks in for another nine minutes.<br />Perhaps the weakest song on the album is Phil Collins' &quot;More Fool Me,&quot; track 4. It's another pleasant, melodic, melancholy song that tugs at heartstrings...but almost seems out of place amidst all the epic tracks. Again, this foreshadows what's to come when Phil takes over the helm -- and steers the band into the rocks -- a few years later.<br />&quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot; is next and it's a doozy. All 12 minutes of it. Beginning with a drum and fife corps, the song quickly becomes a tale that the liner notes say was &quot;Taken from a news story concerning two rival gangs fighting over East-End Protection rights.&quot; This, to me, is the real showcase of the entire album. I love this track.<br />The final two tracks (&quot;After theOrdeal&quot; and &quot;The Cinema Show/Isle of Plenty&quot;) are good, but can't -- in my opinion -- top &quot;Battle.&quot; So I often skip over them. For the record, &quot;After the Ordeal&quot; sounds like a song that'll become the trademark Phil Collins-led Genesis of a few years subsequent. It has a pop sound and feel to it.<br />&quot;The Cinema Show/Isle of Plenty&quot; begins slowly, but beautifully, and contins some of the albums most poignant lyrics. It's a great song (I love the musical change-up about 6 minutes into it). But, again, it's no match for &quot;Battle.&quot;<br />Selling England By the Pound is one of the most important Genesis albums ever recorded. Best of all, unlike Nursery Cryme and Foxtrot, Selling England sounds as fresh today as the day it was recorded.<br />If you don't have this album in your collection, you should be ashamed of yourself. Buy it today.  No, don't wait. Don't read any more reviews. Buy it NOW.
078322804X|5.0|It started out as a bit on Saturday Night Live, and grew into probably THE most successful movie ever to have had it's genesis in that particular medium.  And who would've thought that a couple of character actor/comedians would emerge from an innovative four-or-five minute act as \\"legendary\\" bluesmen of their era?  Which is exactly what John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd did after first taking their show on the road as an opening act for the likes of Steve Martin, and then parlaying it into a feature length motion picture, \\"The Blues Brothers,\\" directed by John Landis.  When Joliet Jake Blues (Belushi) is released from prison, his brother Elwood (Aykroyd) is there to pick him up, in-- of all things-- a used police car.  And it doesn't bode well for this particular pair of out-of-work musicians, who on a visit to the orphanage in which they grew up discover that it is about to be shut down unless some taxes are paid on it, and soon.  But what can Jake and Elwood do to help?  They're broke.  Well, after a bit of pondering and a couple of good production numbers later, Jake sees the light (literally), and it all becomes perfectly clear:  They have to put their band back together and stage a concert, the proceeds of which should more than pay for the taxes on the orphanage.  It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it, and don't tell Jake and Elwood it's not possible, because they're on a mission from God...<br /> It's a fairly simple plot, told in a straightforward manner by Landis, who creates a visually stimulating and aurally satisfying movie that follows the adventures of the Brothers Blues as they travel around the good state of Illinois, seeking out the members of their former band and formulating their plan to save the orphanage.  Along the way they run afoul of a country/western band, incite the ire of some Illinois Nazis, ingratiate themselves to the diners in a classy restaurant, wreck an entire mall and generally wreak havoc wherever they go.  It's a total rushof excitement, backed with a blur of real blues, served up by some of the truly legendary performers of our time, like Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway (doing his trademark \\"Minnie the Moocher\\") and John Lee Hooker.  Not to mention the \\"band\\" itself, comprised of Steve \\"The Colonel\\" Cropper, Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn, Murphy Dunne, Willie Hall, Tom \\"Bones\\" Malone, Lou \\"Blue Lou\\" Marini, Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy and \\"Mr. Fabulous\\" himself, Alan Rubin, all there to back the incomparable vocal stylings of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, who are determined to save their old home, now under the auspices of \\"The Penguin,\\" Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman).  But one question remains to be answered:  Who is Camille Ztdetelik (Carrie Fisher), and just what is she trying to do to Jake?<br /> Without question, this was a great gig for Belushi and Aykroyd, who to millions of people ARE, and will forever be, the \\"Blues Brothers.\\"  And forevermore shall they be linked in the memories of anyone who has seen this movie, heard their records or caught their act on SNL.  Dan Aykroyd has gone on to have a successful and varied career in movies, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (for \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" in 1989), while John Belushi, of course, left us quite suddenly and way too soon, just as his career was on the rise.  Were they great singers?  Of course not; but they were accomplished performers who sagely surrounded themselves with the best of the best, a \\"band's\\" band that really made this gig work, because the music worked.  Add to that the energy, excitement and passion they themselves brought to it, and you have their formula for success, which can be measured by the strong following they still enjoy to this day.  And what a pity that Belushi isn't around to realize it.<br /> Memorable in supporting roles are John Candy as Burton Mercer (who uttered the unforgettable line, \\"Orange whip?  Orange whip?--); Henry Gibson as the steel-eyed head Nazi; Steve Lawrence, as agent Maury Sline; Charles Napier as Tucker McElroy, \\"Lead singer and driver of the Winnebago\\"; and Jeff Morris, who will always be remembered as Bob, owner of \\"Bob's Country Bunker,\\" the place with \\"both\\" kinds of music, Country \\"and\\" Western.  <br /> The additional supporting cast includes Steven Williams (Trooper Mount), Armand Cerami (Trooper Daniel), Layne Britton (The \\"Cheese Whiz\\"), Ralph Foody (Police Dispatcher) and John Landis (Trooper La Fong).  Also, watch for cameos by Paul Reubens (Waiter), Frank Oz (Corrections Officer), Twiggy Lawson (Chic Lady) and Steven Spielberg as the County Clerk.  A thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable movie, filled with memorable scenes and lines you'll be quoting for years to come (Aykroyd, in that \\"clipped\\" Elwood Blues delivery, to Tucker McElroy:  \\"We'll, ah-- we'll talk to Bob--\\"), \\"The Blues Brothers\\" is a great film-- not in the sense of a film that should have walked away with a bagful of Oscars, but great for what it is and for the special place it holds in the history of the cinema.  And, yes, it does have a place all it's own.  Because a movie doesn't have to be \\"Citizen Kane,\\" or \\"Gone With the Wind\\" to be \\"great.\\"  It's the ones that make you feel something for whatever reason, or make you laugh; the ones you remember because they're unique or have left their imprint on our culture in some way.  So, check \\"All of the above,\\" or add your own reasons.  For all that it's worth, this is the magic of the movies.
B000002J27|5.0|The 1976 release Trick of the Tail was initially greeted by a tidal wave of skepticism. The departure of Peter Gabriel sent many a proghead into deep, deep depression -- and almost overnight turned Geneis, at one time considered the most influential progressive rock band ever to emerge from England, into a band of lepers.<br />When the smoke cleared, and cooler heads prevailed, it was discovered that -- by gosh! -- the music on this album wasn't half bad. In fact, it was darn good. It still retained all of the depth and musical complexity Genesis had been known for. And even Collins' vocals smacked of Gabriel's.<br />There are some truly outstanding tracks on Trick of the Tail, from the energetic opener (&quot;Dance On a Volcano&quot;) to the often-copied concert favorite &quot;Squonk&quot; to the predictable Phil Collins track &quot;Ripples...&quot; (he tended to average one slow, emotional track per album -- skipping over Lamb Lies Down on Broadway; nothing emotional on that album) to the tongue-in-cheek title track to the brilliant closer &quot;Los Endos.&quot;<br />Trick of the Tail ranks up there with my all-time favorite Genesis album, Selling England By the Pound. This is another good album to start with if you're wanting to get into Genesis.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Action movies are allowed to be dumb. Action movies based on videogames are allowed to be dumber. But no courtesy can allow anyone to enjoy that cinematic dropping that is Tomb Raider.<br />This is a bad movie through and through.<br />To think, all they had to is make something like Indiana Jones. They had ~80-100 million dollars, a solid actress in the lead, and no intent to make a good movie.
B000002J1L|4.0|Genesis really came into their own on this CD. It's not their best from the Peter Gabriel era (that title is reserved for Selling England By the Pound, a perfect album if I've ever heard one), but it's very, very good -- essential, in fact, if you're a proghead like me. <br />Following on the heels of Trespass (Genesis' interesting but flawed second album), Nursery Cryme is an astounding leap forward musically -- lead by the still-spooky-after-all-these-years nearly 11 minute epic &quot;The Musical Box.&quot; I still get chills hearing, &quot;Touch me now, now, now, now, now...&quot; What an incredible performance!<br />&quot;For Absent Friends&quot; (sung, it sounds, by Phil Collins) is a touching, melodic second track. Pleasant, and perhaps a foreshadowing of things to come, but not a chart-topper.<br />Things really get moving with the nutty &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed,&quot; the album's third track. The remastering on the entire CD is astounding, but on this track it's truly amazing. Each instrument jumps out of the mix now, with Rutherford's bass guitar sounding crisper and heavier than ever before. Likewise with Collins' drums. And Banks' keyboards. Crystal clear one and all. The entire song is fascinatingly odd in a very British sort of way.<br />&quot;Seven Stones,&quot; the fourth track, is a rather lugubrious song that doesn't really seem to go anywhere.<br />Track 5 -- &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot; -- is a silly track that's interesting only for its tongue-in-cheek lyrics and upbeat musical arrangement.<br />&quot;Harlequin,&quot; track 6, is little more than a stepping stone to the haunting and unforgettable &quot;Fountain of Salmacis,&quot; the seventh and last track, which begins in a very cool way...with music rising and falling as if in waves. Lyrically, it's the stuff of progressive rock circa the early '70s (Nursery Cryme was released in 1971): nymphs, Hermaphroditus, gods and magic. It sounds silly now, but back then it was heavy, deep stuff, I can assure you.<br />Overall, Nursery Cryme will probably be remembered more for &quot;The Musical Box&quot; than anything else. The strength of that song -- which, I guarantee, will give you the creeps -- is worth 4 stars. The rest of the album is, sadly, rather strange and tedious...in a charming, British sort of way, of course.<br />If you're new to Genesis, and want to know what they sounded like back when they still had something musical to say (i.e., circa the Peter Gabriel or VERY early Phil Collins era), don't start with this CD. Start with Selling England By the Pound. This album, and it's virtual twin Foxtrot, is fascinating, but it's not their best.  (Although the opening and closing tracks are downright brilliant.)
B000050XEI|5.0|As usual, Enya has produced another great CD!  I have every CD she has out, except her greatest hits, and she is the only artist that I can truly say that I enjoy every single song on each CD.  On all other CDs there is one or two songs I don't care much about. Not hers.  Her offerings to the Lord of the Rings soundtracks are wonderful, as well.
B000002J1M|4.0|Foxtrot's 23-minute epic &quot;Supper's Ready,&quot; a quasi-Biblical tale about the last supper of Christ, is one of the most fascinating and memorable songs you'll ever hear. The odd, complicated time signatures, alone, will occupy your mind...while the heart-felt, if somewhat enigmatic, lyrics will occupy your emotions. This song is not to be missed. Not if you wish to respect yourself in the morning.<br />The best of the rest of Foxtrot, released in 1972, can be summed up in two tracks: &quot;Watcher of the Skies,&quot; with it's classic keyboard intro...and &quot;Get 'Em Out By Friday,&quot; which captures all of what was to become the classic Genesis progressive rock sound: Steve Hackett's fuzz-tone/sustain lead guitar work, Peter Gabriel's creepy, sometimes falsetto, sometimes spoken, vocal style, Tony Banks' clever, inventive keyboard work, Mike Rutherford's creative bass work and Phil Collins' competent, but not technically brilliant, drumming. (If you want to hear a drum god, listen to Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy. Wow.)<br />The multi-movement &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; steals the show and practially IS the album. Give yourself plenty of time to listen, though. It's well worth it, but that's nearly a half hour you'll have to budget out of your hectic day.<br />To be honest, even though &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; is a true classic, I prefer Nursery Cryme, their previous album.<br />The REAL jewel in the Genesis crown was released a year after this album: Selling England By the Pound. Borrow Foxtrot to hear &quot;Supper's Ready.&quot; But, by all means, buy Selling England. You'll thank me for it later.
6304806418|5.0|BEWARE!  In order to love this movie you must be able to like....<BR>1. World History<BR>2. Musicals<BR>3. Antonio Banderas<BR>4. Madonna<BR>Okay, so this is a TALL order.  This is a beautifully set movie that was well received worldwide except in the US.  I feel it's because nobody in the US would take Madonna seriously as an actress, let alone as a serious actress.  OPEN YOUR MINDS PEOPLE because Madonna can act.  In my opinion, she gave one of the most inspired acting jobs on the screen ever!  This movie goes down as one of my alltime favorites.
B00005OAA6|5.0|After being ind the background of the Spice Girls, Victoria is the last to release a solo album. I must say that I'm impressed she can write songs and she can sing, although her voice isn't nsomething special, but she remains to keep it clean, only on one song her voice fades a bit ( Unconditional Love ). <BR>I was one of the first to buy this album ind Denmark, and I must say that she's really worth the money. The single from this album ( Not Such An Innocent Girl ), is great but my favorites songs is, That Kind Of Girl, Midnight Fantasy, No Trix, No Games and I Wish. On this album Victoria has really done a nice work of mixing, pop/ rock and a lot of Rnb sounds. I Wish when I first heard this songs I thought this must be the latest work from Destiny's Child, but it was Victoria Beckham, I must say she really surprised me. I don't usual listen to pop music, before I bought this album I used to listen to Grace Jones and Tracy Chapman but know I hear Victoria's album all day. <BR>Not Such An Innocent Girl: The first single from this album, great vocal and joyable sound. <BR>A Mind Of Its Own: A good touching song about love.<BR>That Kind Of Girl: Also a great love song. <BR>Like That: Great but, not as great as the others. <BR>Girlfreind: She also could have called this song: I Want What She's Got. <BR>Midnight Fantasy: Uhh a fantastik night loving song, for the lonely ones. <BR>I.O.U: I saw her singing live whit this song, I think that this song is deticated to David Beckham. ( No I Know it's made for him ). <BR>No Trix &amp; No Games: A great girl power song, this song is really hot stuff. <BR>I Wish: A song about a woman who likes a man but she can't tell him HOW SAD. <BR>Watcha TalkinBout: not really that good. ( Sorry Vicky )<BR>Unconditional Love: Hmmm a lovely song, but her voice is not as clean and clear. <BR>Every Part Of Me: Ohhhhhh a song about her lovely boy Brooklyn. <BR>At last I would like to say: David your lucky to have this wonderful woman and a beautiful child, treat them good. My respect to Victoria, David and Brooklyn.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Ok, one thing I have to say, is that I have heard that some people feel as though No Doubt has become too repetitive with the lyrics.  However, I don't know if you have noticed, but that is something that we call a CHORUS. No Doubt has always been that way, I just think that some people are just disappointed in the change they have made. No Doubt has always in a way wanted to release an album like this, and I love it. Besides, any band that has been around for a while has had the actual need to change it up a little. And those that don't (Metallica, Bon Jovi), don't stick around for much longer. All I have to do when my day (is bad) is put the album on, and I am instantly relieved. It's very upbeat and inspiring, and although some may think that the lyrics are not as \\"in depth\\" they are still creative and helpful to anyone that listens close enough. I love this album, and I believe that it is wonderful. I am also a huge No Doubt fan and I have all of their albums. And I urge everyone of you to buy it. Hey, and go to a store and listen a little, or if you don't like it, you can return it! It's well worth the risk!
0385505833|3.0|There are so many people who have gotten so lost in the &quot;materialistic/commericial hype&quot; of Christmas, that they've  forgotten the true meaning of the holiday.  This book was truly a pleasure to read... It had me laughing out loud quite a few times.  Good book, quick read.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|THIS RULES! What amazing soulmoving music! I could never imagine music like this! This band sounds like they've been around for a long time. This has truly got some epic songs. Dream Of Mirrors, man. Perfect balance between light and dark. There's also Blood Brothers, a song I think I'll cover some day. This is godly! The orchestral movements also add to the songs. The metal tunes are also amazing and very hooky. Ghost Of The Navigator is amazingly complex, and it still can get fans into it. No fillers. Truly a work of art.
0375418466|5.0|Being as I just love all that is Star Wars, this was no exception.  I loved getting the meat movies don't have time to cover.  Makes the movies all the richer.
B000002JSP|2.0|I keep on thinking, if John Bonham might've lived, we would get a heavy album from them. That's what Jimmy Page said. This album, while it has some good tracks, is mostly filler. This stuff should've been on Coda, and the material on Coda should've been this album. There are way too many syntheizers on here, you barely hear the guitar! It was unique at the time, but now it will just make old members angry. I'm Gonna Crawl is good, and so is South Bound Saurez, but I can see where they were going with this album. Laregly forgettable.
B00005QXXO|5.0|This is a really short CD.  Only 40 minutes, which may seem like a lot, but when you figure that they could have fit three or four more songs on here, that's really upsetting.  What's really missing is &quot;They Pyramid Song&quot;, which I thought was the best song that they did live next to Idioteque.<br />Still, you have to get this CD.  It's live versions of the songs off of KidA and Amnesiac, and some of these versions I think are better than the original ones.  Like Spinning Plates is phenominal.  As another review said, there's nothing compared to actually SEEING them perform Idioteque live.  A DVD to go along with this release would be very nice indeed!<br />I give &quot;I might be wrong&quot; five stars anyway, simply because I can't stop listening to it.  It's phenominal.  I highly recommend this CD.
630469654X|5.0|This movie is the best movie that i have seen in a long time. It is well thought out, thrilling, romantic, and wonderfully sad. It has a great happy ending. I TOTALLY recommend this movie. It's rated PG here, but some places rate it PG-13. That's just because a man at the end gets stabbed and it shows a lot of blood. Thank you for your time.
B000006SGT|5.0|This compilation collects most (ahem) everything by the classic Animals lineup of Eric Burdon (vocals), Alan Price (keyboards), Hilton Valentine (guitar), Chas Chandler (bass) and John Steel (drums), plus a few numbers featuring Price's replacement Dave Rowberry. All the major hits are here in their original form - the transcendent &quot;House of the Rising Sun,&quot; &quot;I'm Crying&quot; (a rare Burdon/Price collaboration), the sublime &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; and the killer anthems &quot;We Gotta Get Out of this Place&quot; and &quot;It's My Life&quot;. The album tracks are great, gritty R&amp;B, far more church-sounding than anything by the Rolling Stones, but no less captivating. The rambling monologue &quot;Story of Bo Diddley&quot; is the greatest of Burdon's name-dropping odes, mainly because his zeal is kept in check by a beguiling wit and Steel's bopping beat. Unfortunately, the track is also symptomatic of the band's inability to write conventional rock songs with any consistency. Apart &quot;I'm Crying&quot; and a few others (the smoky &quot;For Miss Caulker,&quot; the earnest &quot;I'm Gonna Change the World&quot;), the material is drawn from R&amp;B masters like Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry and Ray Charles. The organ-driven, rolling-rather-than-rocking-sound of Newcastle's finest admittedly hasn't aged as well as, say, the contemporary fuzztone future shock of the Yardbirds, but no matter. This is a necessity for anyone with even a passing interest in British R&amp;B or 60s rock. Burdon's amazing, booming voice is already at its peak, sounding far more commanding and mature than contemporaries like Mick Jagger or Keith Relf (although he falls short of Van Morrison). Eric never topped these records for sheer emotive power. The other Animals may have hated Alan Price for hoarding the &quot;Rising Sun&quot; royalties, but his keyboards were brilliant, as soulful as Burdon's singing, and far more disciplined. Hilton Valentine, however, was theband's secret weapon. A master of barbed-wire guitar lines, Hilton created the thrilling arpeggio that kicks off &quot;Rising Sun&quot;. Note how Valentine's guitar becomes more pronounced as the CDs progress, particularly when Rowberry takes over on &quot;It's My Life.&quot; Chas Chandler's bass was only adequate, but the band's 12 bar format never proved beyond his grasp, and John Steel was an eager, swinging drummer who might have made more of an impact if his beat was mixed a bit louder. Mickie Most was an erratic producer (he foistered Herman's Hermits onto an unsuspecting world and helped ruin the Yardbirds) but his partnership with the Animals was magic, mainly because he knew how to pick singles that suited their working class grit and the band had the genius to turn those rough diamonds into timeless gems. Buy this set. Now. (BTW: &quot;It's My Life&quot; was the final single Most produced for the group. The Tom Wilson-produced hits &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot;, &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; and &quot;See See Rider&quot; fall outside the scope of this collection. If you want those, buy ANIMALISMS. It's also great.)

B000002R68|3.0|This is the most accomplished and well-produced of the albums by Eric Burdon and the (New) Animals, but its appeal depends on whether or not you can tolerate a LOT of flower power. The boys lay it on thick here, making much of THE TWAIN SHALL MEET a bombastic and cloying listen. At its best, TWAIN is an unhinged period piece crammed with ornate, kitchen-sink musicianship. The New Animals are at their peak as a unit here, but they're constantly undermined by Burdon's obsession with hippie cliches. Indeed, Eric's overzealousness isn't a million miles from William Shatner's interpretations of Beatle and Dylan lyrics. If you're a fan, you'll dig knowing the Top 20 hits \\"Monterey\\" (love them two-bar imitations of the acts!) and \\"Sky Pilot\\" (with Burdon in dynamite voice) are here, even if both are symptomatic of the great singer's tackiness as a lyricist. Yet both seem subtle and restrained compared to the crude cosmic consciousness of \\"No Self Pity\\" and \\"All Is One,\\" on which Eric sounds like a psychedelic Tony Orlando. \\"Closer to the Truth\\", the album's one blues track, starts off fine, but quickly sinks into a meandering groove that's crying out for a galvanizing guitar solo. Bassist Danny McCulloch's ethereal \\"Orange and Red Beams\\" (hilariously mistitled \\"Oranges and Red Beans\\") was allegedly a favorite song of Jimi Hendrix's, which is the only recommendation I can think to give it. Burdon's powerful singing (especially on \\"Sky Pilot\\"), the band's instrumental versatility, Tom Wilson's expansive, trippy production, and Vic Briggs' skillful arrangements are the saving graces of this record, which is a ball in a \\"peace, brother\\" kind of way. To put it in its proper perspective, TWAIN is far more assured than the inflated indulgences of WINDS OF CHANGE or LOVE IS, but it's still an album only aging hippies (or Burdon fanatics) will listen to more than once, unless your bag is camp.

1572524413|5.0|If there is one scene that explains the enduring appeal of 'Touchez Pas Au Grisbi' (basically 'don't touch the loot'), it is this: Max (Jean Gabin at his most Mitchum-esque), an aging hood who has pulled off a massive airport robbery and plans to retire quietly to the country, sits in his apartment one night with his old friend, the somewhat lunk-headed Riton (Rene Dary).  Riton's girlfriend (Jeanne Moreau) has left him for a young gangster, Angelo (Lino Ventura in a sensational debut), whom she has informed of the job, and who is trying every means possible to snatch the gold.  <br />So this scene is of crucial generic urgency, with rippling consequences for the development of the plot.  What Becker films is entirely without urgency or consequence.  In complete silence, he follows the middle-aged men as they enter the apartment, sit down, prepare a light supper, eat and talk; Max then gets up, takes out mattresses and pillows for his friend's bed like a good chambermaid, undresses in the bathroom, brushes his teeth, Riton likewise; then they both go to bed.  This beautifully understated, intimate and domestic scene does not replace the crime genre, but co-exists in paralell with it, showing what is at stake.  <br />This split defines the movie, from the conflict between older and younger characters (and men and women); between Max's affable respectability and his latent sadism; between bright interiors of oppressive theatrical artifice and dark outdoor locations; between static scenes where nothing much happens and jolting bursts of brutal violence and action.  You even find it in the brilliant closing car chase, as thrilling location work intercuts with Hitchcock-style back projection.  This disparity between the real and ideal gives the film its melancholic, philosophical heart, and gives the climax an over-powering force, set in the quiet countryside to which Max wished to retire, and which can only offer backdrop to a bloodbath.<br />Critics have found in 'Grisbi', a gangster film about loyalty, treachery, collaboration, surveillance, torture, clandestine activities, secret hideouts, rural slaughter and military hardware, some kind of allegory for the Nazi Occupation of France a decade previously.  This explanation is attractive because the period had been tacitly removed from the public sphere.  But there is nothing so portentously grand in Becker's characteristically light handling.  Max and the gangsters may well have been in the Resistance - Melville has said that underworld methods and contacts were vital to both Resistance and Gestapo - as their knowledge of torture techniques and gun-smuggling suggests.  But the Resistance were absolutely crucial to their time and place, whereas Max and his friends are resolutely out of time, relics from the past who can only play at assimilation - the recurring motif of Max's harmonica theme suggests a man literally stuck in a groove.  Max himself exists in a paralell world to the realities of a 1950s France nowhere to be seen on screen, a revenant infernally condemned to repeat mistakes and watch old friends die.

B000056KTG|5.0|Iggy Pop, all round mad man, extreme entertainer, and one of the originators of a whole musical cycle, influencing such diverse acts as \\"David Bowie\\", \\"The Sex Pistols\\", \\"Marilyn Manson\\", and \\"Hanoi Rocks\\".<br /> In 1972 Iggy was a spent force and living in the gutter, (that's not just a saying, he was literally living on the streets). His band \\"The Stooges\\" had just released a couple of non - selling records, 1969's self titled debut and 1970's \\"Fun House\\", which at the time meant nothing, but were in actual fact wonderful garage albums, which many bands far more famous would have been well proud of. Elektra records having fulfilled their contract with them dropped them like a hot potato, at which point \\"The Stooges\\" self imploded. But Rock `n' Rolls premier fairy godmother \\"David Bowie\\", was in town with his own mentor \\"Tony Defries\\", \\"David Bowie\\" was a long term Iggy fan, and was determined to help, firstly summoning Iggy to New York, and then to London, England, when no suitable musicians could be found, one by one the original stooges were found and relocated to good old U.K. Left alone in C.B.S. studios in London for 12 days, they came up with this slab of timeless Rock `n' Roll. The playing of the band is absolute edge of your satin pants stuff, the rhythm section of the Asheton's brothers is as heavy as any blacksmiths anvil, these two may not have been the most technical of musicians, but you don't get that kind of telepathic lock without blood. James Williamson was the perfect foil for the out of control vocalist, not so much a partner in crime, more of an avenging henchman cum angel, left to his own devices he may not of been able to put together his aunties garden rockery, but getting the guitar to rock was not a problem, a natural born hip swiveling, guitar slinger, his work is all at the same time, sloopy, furious, neurotic, but with plenty of power, filling every possible gap on the album with manic guitar solo's.<br /> Iggy himself turns in a vocal performance that many would try and imitate, but very few would attain, if your interested in hearing about how a gristly American Rock `n' Roll singer from the early seventies should sound like then have a decko at this boy on Raw Power. (We've not talking Eagles or Journey here)<br /> The lyrics although exceedingly politically incorrect are also very perceptive, on \\"Your Pretty Face\\" Iggy bawls out \\"You're pretty now, but just wait, you're not gonna have that weapon all the time\\". On \\"Death Trip\\" Iggy is not predicting his own death but admitting he's spitting into the wind with his music, against the record companies of the time, but with a little help from his friends Iggy is still smearing himself with peanut butter today. Raw Power clocks in at just under 34 minutes which is a bit short in this day and age, but then the excellent photography by Mick Rock for the artwork, helps to make up for this, and there's not a filler amongst these gems.<br /> Turn it up loud or you'll miss the point.<br />Mott the Dog.ormance that many would try and imitate, but very few would attain, if your interested in hearing about how a gristly American Rock `n' Roll singer from the early seventies should sound like then have a decko at this boy on Raw Power.

B00005AREQ|5.0|If Jeff Beck was lucky enough to be a Dog, he'd probably be a Whippet: fast, intelligent, dangerous, and highly strung.<br /> He came to prominence in the mid-Sixties. Then, his guitar slinging capabilities were put to the test when he successfully replaced Eric Clapton in the Yardbirds. After blowing his mind (and everyone else's) whilst on tour in America, Mrs. Beck's Bad Boy spent the next few years searching for his musical kennel. First of all there was the Blues rock of the Jeff Beck Group which sensationally contained Rod Stewert, Ronnie Wood, and Nicky Hopkins on keyboards, (who turned down Led Zeppelin to join this outfit). Then there was a second edition of the band, with Cozy Powell, which went nowhere. After that he forged a union with ex-Vanilla Fudge rhythm section Tim Bogart and Carmine Appice (British Dogs & American Cats obviously don't mix!).After which he made this all instrumental album, which was an incredible success all over the world. Supported by Max Middleton on Keyboards, he also had the fifth Beatle, George Martin, producing the whole thing.' Blow By Blow' finds young Mr. Beck with a bass-drums-keyboards outfit, which was augmented by some tastefully unobtrusive string arrangement. But don't let that fool you, the guitar is right up there in your face throughout. All his trade mark licks, fierce attacks, thick tones, micro-tonal bending, distortion, screaming feedback, vibrato, sustain, sonic hoodoo, and splatter blasting are all still there.Within the concept of Martin's superb production, Jeff Beck is still let loose on such crazy workouts as \\"Air Blower\\", \\"Scatter Brain\\" and the supersonic \\"Freeway Jam\\", where the sound effects department are put to the test.Jeff Beck also proves that he can structure a melody and turn it into something of great beauty. \\"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\", written by Stevie Wonder is Beck's gorgeous tribute to his own guitar hero, the sadly departed Roy Buchanan. The final track,\\" Diamond Dust\\" is the guitarist at the absolute peak of his powers, clocking in at nearly nine minutes. It's guaranteed to send shivers up and down your spine. Blow By Blow was certainly Jeff Beck's finest hour but, to get the full blown story, you should also buy the 3 C.D. Beckology, which will take you with Jeff Beck from 1962 - 1990.

0767840135|5.0|I was sitting on the couch and watchingthe dvd. I never heard of cirque du soleil until then. After all Zoe started her journey and took us all with her into that fantasy with beauitul dreams and horendous nightmares. The acrobatic themes began with the German wheel followed by the diabolo. I have to admit that these two along with the hand balancing and banquine. I have seen lots of amazing diabolo performances when I was in Taiwan, but still found the whole sequence from those four girls astonishing. The German wheel is unbelievable, because it's just hard to imagine how can a human body can direct and redirect the movement of the wheel.......I may have to write a paper to discribe everything though. But I think the only act I like less is the Clowns, they were funny for a while, then they got a little annoying. John Gilkey is great great actor, he made me laugh with every act he put on.<br />I think the best part of Quidam is it's music and theme. The theme, unlike any others cirque du soleil show I have seen, showed the vision of a girl's mind, not just a story from our view anymore. Zoe brought the audience into the fantsy, and led us through her experience of bore, amaze, terror..... I must also say that the it was so unique that Cirque du Soleil used a self-created language in every show. Quidam was no exception. Even some lyrics can never be understood, but the audience coud still feel it, the emotion and the power from the music, the story and all the act. I am getting tired of typing, so I won't write no more. One last thing I have to say is: get the dvd, even if you never like circus.

On songs like 'Negative Creep' and 'School' he just repeats the same thing over and over again.  But that doesn't make it bad.  It's Grunge!  <BR>My favorite song is Mr. Moustache, it's fast and the definitive grunge song.  Paper Cuts is cool too.  Only buy this if your a die hard Nirvana fan.  If your just getting into Nirvana, get In Utero, their best.  Nevermind is good, but it doesn't sound like the grunge we know and love (The guitars are in standard tuning for god's sake!)

Lyra is capture by Mrs. Coulter and is put in a enchanted sleep. Will meets two angels called Balthamos and Baruch. (...)  I really liked this book.I think this book and the Subtle Knife is the best of the trilogy. The Second and Third book connect way better that the first and second. Both are definatly better than the first book, Not that I don;t like the first book. I recommend this book to everyone.
0871137380|5.0|... <br />To me, it's what all non-fiction books should be. It is concise, quick, personal and well documented. <br />Having suffered through many \\"war books\\" and history chronicles, Black Hawk Down was an awakening. It made history fun again. It brought the past to the present in full color and emotion. <br />If you have even a passing desire to understand the U.S. military man, international politics, multi-national forces or the way we fight today, you must read this book. You have my word it will open your eyes to all these and much more. <br />Even if you don't go in for the military stuff, Bowden has made a textbook for investigative reporting. I know I am gushing but I think Black Hawk Down captured what Bob Woodward forgot how to do about four books ago; it tells a compelling story from start to finish without using \\"trust me\\" journalism.<br />Read this book. It will not disappoint you. If you can put it down, I will be shocked. <br />I have already suggested it to three of my friends and know I will keep talking about it for months to come.
B000002C2E|5.0|TIME OUT OF MIND is Bob Dylan's most acclaimed album since, well, since 1975's BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.  It's been a long road from 1975, and in the twenty two years separating the two albums, Dylan became Christian, put out an album heavily influenced by Judaism (INFIDELS), had some real bomb albums, a &quot;comeback album&quot;, a (finally) box set of outtakes, two traditional folk albums, and an unplugged album.  His albums fare from excellent to poor, and during the 1980s he was in a critical funk.  On top of that, four months after this was recorded Dylan had a very close encounter with death, and suddenly critics began wondering what a world without Dylan would be like.  As this was his first substantial self-penned release since the 1980s, the critics fell all over themselves praising it, and TIME garnered a full three Grammies, including the coveted &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, though I think OK COMPUTER was the true album of the year.<br />While I do enjoy TIME OUT OF MIND, I think it is a failure.  When you listen too TIME OUT OF MIND, you listen to two albums that which struggle for dominance and neither one succeed and in turn the struggle mars the finished product.  One is the record Dylan wanted, that old bluesy pre-World War II sound which he gets L&amp;T.  The other is Lanois's modern, clean sound, very laden with studio effects, going against what Dylan wanted. <br />Although it is very dangerous to consider what an artist &quot;intended&quot; (for how are we to know that?), TIME's production ruins what Dylan was trying to do.  I've read about TIME's sessions, and from the session players and from Dylan himself we learn his intent with TIME was to make what LOVE AND THEFT successfully did: make a record which sounded like it was from the early part of this century.  <br />Indeed, had Dylan produced this himself, in all likelihood we would have had a dark, brooding masterpiece which this aims for and would actually succeed, making the record Dylan wanted.  He did it on LOVE AND THEFT (read my two reviews), and I think he could have done it here.  When Dylan contacted Lanois and told him he wanted a record which sounded &quot;primitive&quot; without actually being primitive, Lanois fed him a line and said they could do that, sure.  Lanois was simply the wrong person to produce this album.  If you listen to TIME, you can get a faint shimmer of the record Dylan wanted to make, but you constantly reminded of how it simply won't come through because of Lanois's production.  If you want a glimpse of what Dylan wanted, listen to the TIME outtake &quot;Mississippi&quot; from L&amp;T, which Dylan and Lanois could not agree on how to produce.  That's what TIME could have been.<br />So why did Dylan want Lanois?  Well, he did produce Dylan's OTHER acclaimed album from 1989, OH MERCY which in Dylan's enormous catalogue is overrated.  His three terrible albums before it had only provided a much sharper contrast which would not be there had it been released another time in Dylan's career.<br />Now, after blasting TIME and Lanois for the majority of this review, this is a really good album despite the flaws.  It's a failure, but it's an interesting failure nonetheless.  There are some incredibly strong songs here, and comparing this to OH MERCY, TIME by far comes out the victor.  <br />One thing I need to deal with is the &quot;key&quot; song on this album.  Quite a few of Dylan's albums have one song which the rest of the album is built on (read my BLOOD review).  The key track here is &quot;To Make You Feel My Love.&quot;  Often cited as a beautiful love song, it loses much its impact when taken out of context of the album.  The song is much more touching and heartfelt when you realise that, despite how hopeless life appears to be, Dylan is still trying desperately to make her feel his love.  Within context of the album this song radically changes meaning, and it is also the hope of the album itself.  Despite all the misery and pain, despite all the age and separation, Dylan is still trying, and this track is the foundation for all the other songs on TIME thematically.  <br />Imagine an album as a bottle of wine.  This is BLOOD ON THE TRACKS aged twenty years.  When BLOOD was recorded, Dylan was just entering middle-age and he still had a lot of life before him.  Now, however, he was getting older and it shows.  A lot of the songs are just tired and bitter and pessimistic, and it deals a lot with broken relationships.  Like VoodooLord7 said in his Top Ten Dylan list, there are so many great lines on this record it's unreal (I love the &quot;reality has always had too many heads&quot; from Can't Wait). I like to think that the line where Dylan says &quot;after all these years you're still the one&quot; is about Sara, but who knows.  There is an emotional continuity between this and BLOOD, and while BLOOD is the better album for purposes already cited, you can tell by Dylan's performance that these songs mean a lot to him.  Dylan said this is the first time in a long time where he had protected the songs for a long time before recording them, and it shows.  There's a lot of great stuff on here, and the fact that the production flaws it makes it all the more interesting because you can feel the ascetic tension here. <br />That, perhaps is the best thing about TIME.  The fact that the production takes away from Dylan's intent helps drive the theme of the album in all the more.  This is an album of a world gone wrong, and even though Dylan wants to make a record like he grew up listening too, the world and the music industry is so awry you can't even get that right.  But he'll still try anyway.  <br />One of Dylan's best albums (for all the gripes I still give it a 4 ½ stars), and easily one of his essential records, and that in itself is saying something.
B000003CMC|5.0|Despite the loss of Duane, the Allmans really came together on this one to produce one of the best albums of this category of ALL time.  From all the gems on the first and third side of the LP (Sorry, don't have the CD yet!), to the awesome 'Mountain Jam', the Allmans proved that they were going to put out one great album.  <br />This CD should really be put in the same category as some of the Beatles classics, as so many inspirations to many bands were drawn from classics like &quot;Melissa&quot; to &quot;One Way Out&quot;.  Listening to these songs today still brings chills to my spine, as this music was just so passionate, and so well written and executed.<br />Any fan of music should give this a listen, as this CD should NOT fall in the category of 'Southern Rock' (as it has been placed in here and there for some odd reason) - it is just simply a great bluesy, countryfied rocking CD with a southern influence - no 'Free Bird' here!  My advice - Eat this peach!!! This the Allman's at one of their finest moments...
B00000253N|5.0|This is Dylan's most talked-about LP from his post 1960s career, and while initially the critics were unsure about it, BLOOD ON THE TRACKS rapidly became perceived as one of the most impressive albums Dylan has cut.  The song-writing is strong and assured, and Dylan is as cryptic as ever.  Yet there also seems to be a central theme here: broken relationships.  When asked about this album's reception, Dylan said he never truly understood why people enjoy that kind of pain.<br />Anyone familiar with art know that some of the best art in the world comes from pain.  Bob Dylan's music from 1969 to 1974 was very much characterised by a sort of domesticity which was the central undercurrent to most of his music, being characterized by his familia lifestyle.  While the music found on these albums (NASHVILLE, SELF-PORTRAIT to some extent, NEW MORNING, and PLANET WAVES) are sometimes exciting (especially NASHVILLE, the best of the lot), generally they never quite rise to the level of the artistically impeccable.  <br /> While the domesticity was heartfelt and sincere, it seems Dylan was too content with his life to put a lot into his art.  There was no central drive like there was in the early days, when Dylan wanted to be the next Woody Guthrie, and then the more poetic direction of the mid 1960s, and then a more mellow country direction.  Dylan was too interested in pursuing this path to make us care about the music found on NEW MORNING, etc.  Now, however, he must channel that pain through into his art so he can deal with it.  There's a real passion here that's lacking in the other albums of this period.  This is the culmination of his mellow period, driving Dylan to an artistic catharsis because of a new ingredient in the mix of domestic bliss: pain.<br />This is the reason why BLOOD ON THE TRACKS stands as one of Dylan's most impressive LPs. <br />However, there is a common misconception about BLOOD.  These very painful songs are oft attributed to Dylan's crumbling marriage.  As other reviews have noted, Dylan has stated that this is not a tribute to his rapidly disintegrating marriage to Sara Lowndes.  An artist can use something in their life as a springboard for their art, writing not really about the situation but using the situation as their inspiration to create art.  This may be difficult to understand, and the only reason I believe this is because I also write and I have also experienced this phenomena, which is difficult to understand but I assure you it does exist.  So, BLOOD is not about his crumbling marriage, yet paradoxically it is.<br />Many of Dylan's albums have a central song which all the others can relate too, or you can base your understanding of that album from that one song.  This is most clearly evident on BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, as this track will not only help you understand BLOOD, but also the influence of the painters on Dylan.  There is also a key song to which you base your understanding on: Tangled Up in Blue.  This track approaches a situation from multiple points of view (povs) and chronologically is all over the map.  The past, present, and future merge into one central mass of experience in which time does not have any distinction.  The rest of the album takes its cue from this one song, playing almost like a concept album about pain in human relationships between the sexes.  <br />BLOOD ON THE TRACKS becomes a cubist affair, and &quot;Tangled&quot; gives you the direction in which you need to direct your attention if you really want to understand BLOOD.  BLOOD is about Dylan's relationships with the women in his life, and while all of them are about Sara, one is specifically about Elsie who he was seeing when he cut this album (&quot;You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome&quot;), and yet even that's about Sara, and yet, as I will discuss later, it is not about Sara at all.  But this album records various elements of their relationships at various times, floating on the lake of time rather than swimming in itas most narratives do. This facet of BLOOD shows the influence the painters have had on Dylan, and also brings a great amount of complexity to BLOOD which would otherwise be lacking.<br />This understanding also helps better ease &quot;Jack of Hearts&quot; into its proper place on the album, telling a dense allegory in the old West which is just as relevant to Dylan's pain as the rest of this is.  Although some have looked at this track with disdain, to me it's one of the best tracks on this album and if you get it, this song fits in perfectly.<br />A lot of BLOOD tracks were cut in 1974.  About half the original cuts were deleted from this album and rerecorded.  Dylan cops out here, with the single exception of &quot;Idiot Wind,&quot; which benefits from being recut while the others do not.  The original tracks betrayed to much of the pain he was going through.  BLOOD ON THE TRACKS is remarkable in that it should feel very disjointed, with half of the album cut with Dylan being emotionally bare and honest, and with the other half Dylan purposefully distances himself from the previous version and yet somehow this album has a cohesion which I can't explain.  The most dramatic difference in these versions is &quot;Idiot Wind,&quot; which originally Dylan sang as an sad, resigned tirade, full of pain and sorrow, and yet the released version is marked with a very real and savage sense of anger.  The anger is directed at the woman to begin with, but by the end of the song the anger is also directed against the narrator himself.  Dylan's honesty is polluted and the pain is a little more well hidden, and yet paradoxically this doesn't really matter.<br />BLOOD is full of paradoxes.  It is about his marriage and it isn't, there's a cohesion there which shouldn't be, it is a concept album and yet it isn't.    Anyway you look at it, BLOOD is one of Dylan's must interesting albums, and also one of his best, if not the best.
B000002KKS|5.0|Could there be a Black Sabbath after Ozzy was kicked out?  Hell (and Heaven) yes!  Thanks to Dio, this turned out to probably be one of the best post-Ozzy Sabbath Cd's ever.  I still have the vinyl, and have fond memories of it - and still enjoy it to the max today.  20 years old? Amazing, but just one listen will convince anyone that this is far from 'nostalgic metal' - there is so much high energy on this CD it is hard to contain! From 'Neon Nights', 'Children of the Sea' and 'Die Young' to the intensity of 'Heaven and Hell', one can easily see the influence on the bands of the same genre today.<br />This was Sabbath's 'turning point' at the time, and DIO brought an energy factor that was needed.  It was sad to hear of Ozzy's departure, but Dio stepped in with a passion - and managed to pull Sabbath together to make one of their best EVER.  Take 'Iron Man' for a walk down the lane of 'Heaven and Hell'!
B000059XYL|4.0|Watching any teen movie these days is kind of like having to sit through a gruesome torture.  This meaning that the one's that are any good really do make you sit up and pay attention.  That doesn't mean to say that this film isn't full of the usual clichés - cute virginal girl lost in the big city finds her own sexuality and individuality among others.<br />Still, it's fun.  For one, it's quite blatant without being in the least bit taboo.  Our heroine finds work in a bar, finding that travelling to New York to sell songs isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Initial clumsiness turns to refined solidarity with the other girls that work there and she finds a nice boy who understands her plight.<br />With the cringe-making story you may think that there's nothing good here.  You'd be wrong.  There are some great performances from John Goodman and Melanie Lynskey (of 'Heavenly Creatures' fame - give her more roles!) and great characters like the sassy owner of the bar.  There's some nice throwaway comedy lines and the songs that the girl writes are good but believably unrefined - most are sung solo by her on her keyboard.  The nice thing about it is that it's sweet without ever ramming it down your throat and you can sit back and relax knowing that everything's going to work out right in the end.  Plus there's the piece de resistance where LeAnn Rimes struts her stuff across the bar singing the fantastic 'Can't Fight The Moonlight'.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Pitch Black is a sci-fi/horror movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. But something about this movie is, if you don't really have any desire to see it, most likely you'll find this a boring movie. It's best to have some idea that their on a strange planet with creatures on that come out in the dark, and with an eclips someing, its going to make things more difficult to get the cells to the escape ship and get off the planet. <br />I found this movie very interesting with wonderful acting. The lighting effects are done very well with added mystery to it. The imagination in this movie was also well done, like the creature designs. I own the DVD unrated version, and it is 10 times better then the VHS. Those of you who are looking for an interesting movie with more of a different setting to it, then I would say this is a movie you may like.
B00004BZ16|2.0|The clash blew it on this one.After the overwhelming success of london calling,they had the record company in their hands.What we got as a folow up was a totally waste of vinyl at the time.I remember hearing this being played at the record store thinking it stunk.I thought 20 yrs. later maybe I'd enjoy it more.This album ruined the clash.They had to record a sell out album like combat rock after this garbage.I actually like combat rock way better than this (...).I give it 2 stars for 2 good songs.I couldn't even finish listening to it,so maybe there is another hidden in there.I'm glad I got it as one of my free selections for joining bmg and not the full price.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is the best band.  All of the songs on the cd are awesome and I think that everyone can relate to the lyrics of at least some of their songs.  But if you like rock then get this cd.  I listen to it everyday.  GET IT!!!!
0767805712|5.0|What can I say? I am a sucker for good &quot;B&quot; grade Sci Fi flicks. I love it when films try to express important ideas in simple trappings. This one is nicely done, with some interesting style touches that make it an enjoyable &quot;Friday night&quot; movie.<br />Well worth your money and time.
6305011575|3.0|Firts of all, let me say that I've not yet finished the book, I'm on page 600 and advancing, but I've seen the movie a couple times.<br />Ok, that's real, It's sometimes not a good mirror of the book, however I think it is quite good, I'm 18, and I saw it for the first time when I was 15, and every time I went to my room, I've to run for the light before feeling the clown's presence, I mean, I was scared to hell with it.<br />Tim Curry is great as Pennywise, I discovered it was him jus a few minutes ago, because I had never seen the movie credits before, and now I admire him a lot more than before.<br />I've already ordered this item, and I recomend both, movie and book. If you really liked the movie, read the book, if you really liked the book, think it twice but see the movie.
B000003S09|5.0|This work blew my mind when I was in junior high school and it still does 25 years later. The musicianship is top notch and the songwriting is brilliant. Pink Floyd surpased this work in all it's paranoia, but it took them quite some time. 20th Century Schizoid Man still fascinates and repulses. The saxophone on this cut is quite agressive. Greg Lake's vocals are so crystaline and Robert Fripp pulls out your spine with his Les Paul's fret work..
B00003CXTG|1.0|Typical hollywood love story with worthless little twists and turns; and the most horrific F*-up of history that Hollywood could conger up.  They spent over 140million dollars on it and goodness knows how many millions they wasted on their hype of this waste of film, but it only raked in about a 120million dollars in the theaters.  --  One big Flop!
0064407667|5.0|I recomend  this beacause it's soooooooooo good.Read it,belive me you'll like it.You know I am The Bookworm.
B00005ATQF|4.0|In true-to-form Kubrick fashion, here is another graphic, disturbing and wholly controversial film. <BR>Think of Vietnam movies, and it's a near certainty that Apocolypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket will spring to mind.<BR>Set in two episodes, one in a Texas boot camp, the other in Vietnam the film has little actual plot. It could certainly be argued that the film is disjointed, almost directed on the spot. However, it's compelling.<BR>Overall, it's a true depiction of the depravities of war. Whilst not in the same league as Saving Private Ryan, it's bizarre camera angles, unrestrained violence and gore combined with plenty of black humour serves as an intense thought provoker. This film is one which seems to question the very nature of United States involvement within Vietnam.
B00003CXA4|1.0|I was totally disappointed with the DVD.  &quot;Gandhi&quot; is one of my favorite movies.  But I was so much disappointed with the DVD that I almost disowned it.  It does not have audio or subtitles in Hindi or any other Indian language.  Gandhi was a Gujarati (mother tongue: Gujarati) and an Indian (Language: Hindi).  The DVD has all sorts of subtitles and languages but does not have any language for Indians.  I think the producers of the DVD owed this much to the very Mahatma - and his fellow countrymen - whose life has been depicted in the movie.  Such products should not be simply weighed on money and how much revenue the sales would generate.  Corporations owe something grander than that.
0884271536|5.0|Eli Goldratt continues his application of Theory of Constraints (TOC) to various business processes by focusing on project management with this latest business novella. TOC is a method of creating ongoing improvement in operational processes, as well as a general management philosophy.  Goldratt introduced this theory to world in his best-selling book THE GOAL, where he applied the principles to a manufacturing setting.<br />In CRITICAL CHAIN, Goldratt builds upon the teachings found in THE GOAL.  He quickly describes of constructs of TOC, while spending more time addressing some specific phenomenon of project management versus process management.  This is where the &quot;Aha&quot;s come into play.<br />Goldratt's characters debate and learn why projects often run overdue and over budget, or finish with less completed than originally specified.  The characters debate critical path vs. non-critical path tasks, early vs. late start, resource conflicts, safety buffers in each task, negotiating with subcontractors and suppliers, as well as the erroneous progress accounting/measurement techniques that give everyone a false sense of progress toward completion.<br />Each of these topics were useful in challenging the conventional wisdom of project management.  Each presented some new techniques for managing projects more aggressively.  In my job, I indirectly manage a large number of construction project managers, and this was useful in understanding some of the reasons we struggle to deliver on time and on budget.<br />For those of you looking for the same enlightenment that you probably derived from THE GOAL, you will be mildly disappointed.  For those of you who have not yet read THE GOAL, I highly recommend reading it, because it will provide the foundation material (TOC) in much more depth and clarity.<br />For me, TOC completes the loop of operational concepts that I have pondered over my career, namely how to improve processes and improve overall organizational productivity, while eliminating \\"fire fighting\\" and bottlenecks in production. CRITICAL CHAIN furthers the progress of this thinking relative to a project vs. a process environment.
B00003CXTG|5.0|A Fantastic movie.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.
0385121679|5.0|The first time I read this book was four years ago, in the eighth grade.  I can still remember reading it now.  My room is in the basement and I vividly remember the way I kept looking over my shoulder while reading the scene where Jack is stalked by the hedge animals and the way I jumped when the heater went on all of a sudden.  I remember the way I almost wanted to stop reading and go to sleep because it was scaring the (...) out of me but I couldn't put it down.  I remember thinking after I finished it that it was the scariest book I have ever read.<BR>  Now, four years later, I was in the library of my high school (as I am now, as I write this review) walking through the aisles of books until I came upon the Stephen King section.  I saw the shining there and suddenly felt compelled to read it again.  It took it off the shelf, went over to a chair, sat down and started reading.  I had just about finished the job interview section when the bell rang. Quickly, I checked out the book and left for my next class.  As I reread the book over a course of 2 days I went through the same things as the first time-staying up late reading, getting scared, finishing it and wishing that it was longer so that I could keep reading... That's when I realized that this is not only an extremely good tale of horror, it is a masterpiece of fiction.  It is just as good as the first time everytime you read it.  This book is undoubtedly worth buying.  I suggest buying The Stand at the same time (I am currently rereading that book also) because once you finish the Shining, you will be hungry for more of SK's masterpieces.
B00005OWIU|5.0|You can really hear the master work by John Williams. Like always, he can create the ideal music for a motion picture and withouth it, a movie isnt a movie. As a John Williams fan and also Harry Potters i recommend this soundtrack very much!
6305736650|5.0|One of the great movies of all time, a classic gem that is as entertaining today as it was in the 1940s. In Casablanca, Morocco, a haven for European expatriates fleeing Nazi rule, cafe owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) struggles to remain neutral. Into his life comes an old flame, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor Lazslo (Paul Henreid), on the run from the Nazis (he's part of the French Resistance movement). Rick's neutrality is sorely tested as he is torn between his resurgent feelings for Ilsa and the need to see her and her husband escape the encroaching Nazis. <br />Peerless, Oscar-winning direction, excellent dialogue, and outstanding performances highlight this legendary film. All of the leads are solid, with an especially good job by Bogart--he's cynical and detached one moment, subtly emotional the next. His pain often shows in his acerbic comments and devil-may-care attitude. But there's compassion somewhere in Rick's heart, and a desire to do the right thing. After all, he's fought for righteous causes before, yet seems reluctant to do so again. Why? Part of Rick's mystique is the fact that that question is never answered. His romance with Ilsa--both past and present--rings true; Ilsa and Rick ache for each other, yet they are torn between their romance and the necessity of her marital vows coupled with the need to keep Laszlo alive for the sake of the French Resistance. Ilsa still loves Rick, yet she's also very devoted to Laszlo. This set the standard for tragic romances loooong before \\"Titanic.\\"<br />The fine supporting performances include a slick, conniving turn by Peter Lorre and a wry one by Claude Raines as the corrupt (but curiously sympathetic) police chief Reynaud. The character interactions (especially the good rapport between Raines and Bogart) and motivations are convincing  and well-thought out. Even the music is wonderful; can Dooley Wilson sing, or what? <br />This multiple Oscar winner (Direction, Picture, Screenplay; shouldhave won more, in my opinion) has many wonderful highlights: Wilson singing \\"As Time Goes By;\\" Henreid leading the French National Anthem in front of a group of Nazis; the unexpected, heartbreaking, and memorable finale. Indeed, this film has become indelibly embedded in our popular culture; expressions such as \\"Here's looking at you, kid,\\" \\"We'll always have Paris,\\" and \\"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\" are familiar parts of our culture. Fantastic in every way, nearly perfect; multiple viewing may be required to catch all of the subtleties of this extraordinary film. A classic!<br />About the DVD: Why no varied formats, and why so few extras? Other than a documentary featuring Lauren Bacall, there's little else of note. This film deserves the fine treatment that \\"Citizen Kane\\" received.
B00003CXUM|5.0|As a huge, long-time fan of Wong Kar-Wai, I was very excited to hear about his latest effort, In the Mood for Love being released theatrically in the US. I had ordered the Chinese DVD in late 2000, and after viewing it was sure that once critics saw the film, the auteur would finally receive his comeuppance. Unfortunately, another &quot;Asian&quot; film (which was funded by US sources) came out in 2000 - a much bigger, more accesible film - that blew the competition away. <br />As they did with Lars Von Trier's The Idiots, USA Films has relegated In the Mood for Love away to the back shelves, preferring to spend more time on DVD special ediions of tripe like One Night at McCool's. If you were lucky, you lived in one of the few cities that In the Mood for Love played at in its theatrical run. If you are less lucky, your video store has rented to you a pan and scan VHS copy.<br />But gripes are no longer necessary as the wonderful Criterion has decided to release a spectacular 2-disc DVD set of ITMFL in late February. Supposedly a port of the Region 2 French Special Edition, the set includes hours of bonus material, including a half-hour of very interesting deleted scenes, complete with the director's commentary - a first.<br />I currently own three version of the film (Chinese VCD, Chinese DVD, and French Region 2 2-disc SE), and could not feel more obliged at the prospect of purchasing a (pricey) fourth. If you thought that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was what Asian film is all about, you are sorely mistaken. Pre-order Wong Kar-Wai's masterpiece In the Mood for Love to begin educating yourself on the beauty of cinema.

B00005QZWI|5.0|Listening to this score for the first time, I was impressed that it immediately came alive thematically and dramatically.  Film scores always rely on cues in the film and that Shore has produced what is more of a tone poem is commendable. It has more roots in Richard Strauss than Wagner.  If you read the carping reviews here and are put off by amateur criticism you will miss one of the best scores of all time for what promises to be one of the best films of all times. The important things is that it does NOT sound like Williams, Horner or Goldsmith or any other films composer's work even in the short sequence of hornpipe.  If one listens to it and is not immediately able to conjure up all the imaginative storytelling of Tolkien's writing, they're not listening.  It's going up on my shelf alongside &quot;Krull&quot; and other great sci-fi/fantasy scores.

The important things is that it does NOT sound like Williams, Horner or Goldsmith or any other films composer's work even in the short sequence of hornpipe.  If one listens to it and is not immediately able to conjure up all the imaginative storytelling of Tolkien's writing, they're not listening.  It's going up on my shelf alongside &quot;Krull&quot; and other great sci-fi/fantasy scores.
