B000FYVOJC|4|not sure if it was necessary to get the vacuum but I hate the thought of nose hairs everywhere so I guess it is fine.
B00TSTZQEY|5|worth the money! this is a huge bottle and lavender oil can be used for so much!
B003BWQX46|5|Where's the 10 star button? These blades are unbelievable! Just use caution for the first few shaves. These things are super sharp. After you get past the break in period these blades will give you many smooth, close, comfortable shaves. My current record is forty five, three pass shaves out of one blade. I was almost sorry to see it go.
B005GD1D4I|5|Absolutly love these flat irons. My hair looks and feel like I just left the salon. Heat is equally distributed through my hair without burning my hair. I Thank God for these flatiron
B002LMBLTY|1|While the smell and clean feeling is really nice, this shampoo is so clarifying that it dries my hair out!  One use was enough for me.  Maybe I'll use it as body wash.
B001E96OCO|5|i've tried so many brands, but this is the ONLY one that truly keeps my feet smooth. i put it on every night and can't live without it.
B00H8V6J2C|4|Works well.  Gets the job done. Good price.  So why pay more?
B0085RZLR2|4|This fills the need I have for a soft brush for my Sonicare product. As I have sensitive teeth, this fills the bill. I would recommend it to a friend.
B002VM9DAS|4|I like this shampoo very much, although tends to dry my scalp. I rinse with distilled vinegar, then water to remedy that problem. The concentration of the shampoo is also very good. For my thinning hair, this seems to assist in less hair loss after use. I'd buy this product again.
B001BBADCW|5|This conditioner lathers really well. I didn't have to use a lot and it left my hair feeling extremely clean.
B001S2ZLWQ|5|I've had my clarisonic for about a year now and I can honestly say it's the best purchase I've ever made for my face! I'm never ever going back to hand washing again! My face is so smooth after I'm done washing with it. If you're considering buying this DO IT!!!
B000L1AY3G|5|I love how this takes of my make up and doesnt dry out my skin I can totally tissue wipe my face then use my foam cleanser for the rest. Maintain soft supple skin and no break outs!!! My skin had hyperpigmantation and acne scaring. It was completely friendly with my make up application everyday. Likes it!
B005P0SGPG|5|I have purchased these EcoTools sponges for the past few years and have found that I absolutely HAVE to have them - everywhere. I pack a few when I travel, even though one lasts quite a while, through a number of uses, while retaining the original unused quality.<br /><br />These sponges are soft and kind to facial skin, without any sense of abrasive or rough material, as they are cellulose, and not synthetic.<br /><br />They are ideal for makeup removal, including eye makeup removal, around the tender skin surrounding the eyes, as well as on the eyelids.<br /><br />I have nothing but praise for these sponges, and am so delighted to find them here on Amazon when I could no longer find them in any retail stores where I routinely previously purchase them.
B002Z6G8UI|5|Saw a woman in a restaurant using one of these lighted lipsticks.  It certainly caught my eye as she applied the gloss.  Figured my wife would like one. Hard to find things to surprise her anymore. Does seem to catch the eye of people around her.  They want to find out where she got it.
B00009RF1E|4|Meets what I wanted it to do.
B00563C0DQ|1|I have used these &#34;Sheer white strips&#34; from many other sellers and been quite happy with them in the past so I bought these from this seller.  When I received them, they were all dried up and shriveled.  I bought two boxes since I have a family of four and we use a box a night basically as a family ;)  we initially tried using the defective strips but couldn't get them to attach to our teeth so we each (all four of us) opened up a second tray but those didn't work either.  When I returned the left over the seller credited me for only one box.  What about the first box that was defective????<br />I will never purchase anything from this seller again!!<br />Please note that I've never returned anything from Amazon either so I'm not one of those crazy return and leave bad feedback kinda people.... I'm hoping the seller will make this right and credit my other box of Sheer White strips.
B0015ACHUK|5|Bought this for my wife because she loves this foundation and only Amazon sells it for the best price. She's happy I'm happy. Duhhhhh!!! Winning
B003E0VJC6|5|Great
B00I32AN4K|5|I could tell a difference by the first try! I have really thick curly hair and it worked great. It smells amazing too!
B0062CTOY8|5|i really am liking this company for their oils seem to be great quality. I've used aura cacia and still love them but plant therapy i am really liking as well
B004D2493K|5|RoC is the best what more can you say
B004UKSLFC|4|Recommend a good product to buy
B0043OYFKU|2|yeahhhh not really useful. used it a few times and stopped. save your money or splurge on a clarisonic, this is just like using your fingers but takes more time.
B00E4VJHBO|3|My daughters found them harder to use than anticipated.
B00ALV8EL0|5|This is a  great shampoo for thin hair. This and the conditioner, works well also. My hair is thicker and fuller after usingit.
B000C1VSXU|3|Not really crazy about this perfume. smells kind of cheap. I would not buy it again.
B005LQEE1O|5|Fell in love with this fragrance the first time I tried it.I have been using it for years. I was told years ago that it had been discontinued but later found it at one of those perfume outlet stores. I was very happy to find it on Amazon!!!
B00QW4TJVE|5|Shipped fast. My son was super happy
B001NP1R2Q|5|Definitely one of the best mascaras I've come across and believe me I've tried just about all of them!  The brush is great. It doesn't clump up and brushes through your lashes with the product so you won't need to go through with a lash comb afterwards like with other mascaras. The formula is great too.  Leaves your lashes long and separated.  Think I found a new favorite!
B004BCZ58U|5|I love the colors.
B0063A448K|5|best price was on amazon and that's good enough for me , priced it in the store this was way cheaper we got 8 cans and saved like 30 bucks , sometimes i still feel i have to rub it in don't know how that is but it did protect me in the mexico sun , i also the the 15 and it worked very well.
B00SIHJLAC|5|Beautifully etched plate. Since I'm new to stamping there has been a bit of a learning curve,but I'm proud to say I think I have it all figured out....the designs on this plate are beautiful,I can't wait to get more GoGo Only !!!! Great job!
B009WI18CU|5|Great but, pretty colors, good price!
B008QMWQGK|2|This shower gel disappointed me. The Mandarin scent is all but non-existent. I have purchased unscented Seventh Generation products in the past and there is hardly any difference between those and the Mandarin Shower Gel. Instead, every time I dispense product into my hands, what I do get a whiff of is a noticeable plastic-y scent, obviously coming from the bottle itself - yuck. Will not purchase again.
B000W8ULS6|5|Ever since I took my Mom to Hawaii for a couple of weeks, we've been purchasing this cream. It's great on your skin; especially if you have problems with dryness.
B002N91EE2|2|The bottle looks great. When you pop open the top, you get this candy watermelon smell- very sweet, fruity, and delicious. However, not sure what cooling effect they speak of, and the scent does not last past rinsing like other B&B Works products do. Its great if you just want to smell it while you lather up, otherwise invest in another B&B Works product. I have nothing against them, since I know they make better products than this, but this product is not one of them.
B00AYG9VZ0|5|The original made my skin itchy when I would sweat however, the matte is the best thing ever! I made the switch from Origins and I'm never going back!! The golden medium, matches my skin tone perfectly consider I have such a odd combination of olive/medium skin. I wear daily and it lasts me exactly 3 months!
B001WAKU52|5|My hair stylist recommended this product and now, I can't live without it!  It protects and smooth's your hair from harsh styling tools.  It also works wonders for my 8yr old who happens to hate brushing her hair from all the tangles.
B009CA7S40|2|only buy if your cheap n dnt care to much bout the combs you use cause the little white tips fall off over time im never useing these on my hair because i only use the best products on my hair and my clients.
B0064TWUPO|5|This product is worth all the fuss!  I was a little skeptical at first and then decided to buy it with a gift card I received. No loss to my pocket. After trying it for a week, I definitely noticed a difference in how clean my skin was. My acne also reduced. I really like this product.
B00EJMFUY6|2|wrong product back to floss
B00008IHO3|1|Neutrogena \\"Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch\\" (SPF 50, 70, 85, 100) is okay if you like lots of shine and a greasy feel, which I do not.  Also, if you apply it anywhere within an inch of your eyes, you'll soon have the excitement of watering, burning eyes -- quite a distraction if you happen to be driving.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone who wants a matte finish and eye comfort.
B00RDN9KQW|5|The brushes arrived in good condition and brushes as well.
B0047S9VO2|5|this product really met every expectation i wanted in using make-up brushes.... very pleased indeed. will recommend this product to anyone
B000W7OL0Q|5|the only fragrance my hubby likes
B0037AXFVQ|5|Very useful equipment to track fitness progress.
B001159UMM|5|Feels great since replacing my old blades.
B00D7NGPX8|5|very good
B0039ZZWOC|5|No complaints here
B00BC3YL2W|5|Herstyler has the best products. A little bit goes a long way. I love how my hair feel and it is great protection from heat
B00OGDDWPM|5|Amazing product!  I've tried several lash growth serums and this one actually works!  I started to see results after just one week's of use.  Love the product!
B00C2J6I9O|5|Great styling wig tool that makes it easy to make a wig look nice or on your normal hair.
B00DZZ6HKY|2|I use moisturizing oils a lot. Was excited to get this because I love the hair products in the same brand. Somewhat disappointed in the scent...very light and does not last. The oils is more greasy than moisturizing. Product was as seller described, just not as good of a Moroccan product as I had hoped.
B000RFQVZ6|5|Ok
B000WCL7IK|5|I adore this color and within just a few months have used more than half the bottle. It's very sweet/cute shade, and is almost exactly as pictured.<br />The ONLY (very small) con to this is that it will start to bubble after several days and peel off, but that's several days of full coverage wear.<br />Will definitely buy another bottle.
B000NL0T1G|5|This is the first time I've used a safety razor in over 30 years and this one is nice.  I like the weight of it.  The top unscrews and then you put the blade in.  It is not one of those where you twist the handle and the top opens up.  This razor gave me a close shave. You just use the weight of it to shave, not pressing on your skin.
B00C3OIYUE|5|I usually use another high-end product, but I wanted to try the Estée Lauder eye cream. Turns out it is far superior to the other brand! This eye cream actually hydrates for 24 hours, and it seems to be helping with fine lines and wrinkles.<br />It definitely helps with puffiness. There is almost no fragrance, and it is great for sensitive skin.
B00FG885VW|1|I got those in Violet and Champagne. First, I have to say this - the Violet is nothing like the picture on avon.com, it's more like very very pale blue/lilac? I actually liked Champagne color. But both eye shadows caked before I was even done with the rest of my makeup, with or without the eye shadow primer. They were totally gone by the time I was ready to leave home.<br />Then to add insult to the injury, they made my eyelids puffy.<br />The jar is a tiny little thing, nothing like the picture shows. I guess I was expecting something the size of Maybelline's Color Tattoo jar (btw, an awesome eye shadow!), but then again - I am not going to use them anyways.
B00957WZNE|5|this is oil is orange -- no joke. it's the fruit of the sea buckthorn so it's super orange. it's also amazing for a little color (I'm brown so Im not worried about it making me look like an oompa loompa...but feat not paler ladies, it fades, but if you're worried, use only at night. I use it in the day only for a nice little glow. I mix it 1:1 with rosehip oil and it's OMG good.
B0058O8NM0|4|We have been devoted Ocean Potion customers since we discovered it through our family who vacation yearly in Florida.  I think they can find it in the stores there, but being from the west coast originally and now living in Canada, we never have.  Ocean Potion is the only sunblock that my husband, with his highly sensitve skin, can use without experiencing a burning sensation.  We love that it's mostly natural and can use it on our 4 year old daughter, as well, and without any complaints.  My only issue is that, as with most sunblocks, it leaves a high shine on the skin (not what you want on your face), but compared to other brands it certainly wins out in every other category.  We wish we could get it more easily in Canada!!
B000AQF50Y|5|Exelent
B00EZWCHR8|5|I purchased this wig a few days ago from my local beauty supply store. This wig is cool and soft to the touch, curling iron friendly and very easy to maintain. I have this wig in a color DX2733. I will post pictures. I will be buying a few more in different colors, absolutely love the texture and quality of this unit.
B001AHAEZ8|5|I was in need of a diffuser after I had gotten one for Easter and it melted part of the blow dryer.  It was a channel diffuser, and my hair ended up in one big poof with a single curl.  So, I learned my lesson the hard way -- NEVER use a channel diffuser on wavy hair, especially if you are trying to make it wavier!  But I gave diffusers another shot, and my mom bought me this for my birthday.  It works so well, and I am so glad she bought it.  I wasn't too sure it would fit on my dryer, but I was very happy when it snapped right on.  You just have to give it a good push.  I was afraid I would break it, but that's the only way it'll fit onto your dryer.  This truly is a curly girl's best friend when time is running short and there's no way you can air-dry.  It lifts my hair and sculpts it into pretty, flowing waves.  Now I don't have to worry about a regular old dryer whipping the curls right out of my hair.  I can't really complain.  The only things I really didn't like were the extra little bits of frizz (although it's sort of unavoidable when you're blow drying it) and, although I am more happy about this than I am unhappy (because I have a LOT of hair!), it doesn't add a significant amount of volume to your hair.  But I would still definitely recommend this to everyone I know.  I love it!`
B008BRB9B8|5|For a little novelty item this is really cute.  It is not a cheaply made item and does stand up to tossing around.
B0007VBDF8|5|We use the pins to help cover citrus plants when the weather gets below zero.<br />Not a fun task, but goes much easier when there are enough pins.
B004WSXD4G|1|I read the reviews others have posted on this product and was so happy and excited to finally see a cream that really seemed to work for people.  Sad to say it did absolutely nothing for me. I've been using it for a little less than 2 months now and nothing has changed. I look exactly the same as i did when i started using it. I have cellulite on the back of thighs and butt. Its such a let down to think if it worked for so many it must work for you and see absolutely 0% change.  Dont bother wasting your money.
B001KYVL2G|5|good mascara...happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!
B00DZHYAS8|5|Great product. Leaves hair smooth for several days.
B00LZZ7FZW|5|Very good product. My son's skin was so dry. This really helped.
B008GQFCU8|3|First of all -it was a present,and i mentioned it,but it was not in a present package,no note i have written.. absolutely nothing.. it is very pity.. if there is no service for it ,it is better to know.. i was sure my friend will get this gift set with note i write for him for his birthday.. but it was just a package like it is. so it is ok ..what we can do.. but it is not good.
B005J0MWW0|5|AMAZING FOR VERY DRY SKIN
B002QI6KEO|5|Can't beat the pigment for the price! Looks great on my pale skin.
B00LAFD0FG|5|The O'Nano soft toothbrush provides a thorough and effective cleaning and is gentle on our teeth with its soft bristles. The bristles are densely packed which helps provide a deep cleaning effect for removing plaques and bacteria.<br /><br />The toothbrush is constructed with high quality materials and its contoured handle makes it comfortable to hold in our hands.<br /><br /> I have been using it for a couple of weeks and very satisfied with it.
B002TUU1QM|5|My order was received quickly, which was great as we were running low on what we had. I believe this scent is being discontinued, which is a shame. We're happy to be in stock, especially at a very fair cost.
B00CUG270S|1|I bought one at Target on clearance. It worked awesome for about 6 weeks, then stopped working completely. I was stuck with it at that point. I bought one on Amazon, and same thing....great for few weeks, then suddenly stops working. They sent a replacement, which is currently charging, so we'll see how this one goes. I'm giving it so many chances because when it works, I really like what a good job it does. I use mouthwash in the reservoir and it feels very thorough and I'm sure it's doing a much better job of flossing than I do, even though I use regular floss right before I use this.
B00006JT6O|5|Very good product. I will purchasre again.
B005FNVINA|5|No Issues.  I'm giving this item 5 stars because it is a commodity type item that preformed exactly as it should.  No issues.
B001E766FG|2|A body wash that's good for your skin, good for the budget, and good for the Earth sounds ideal, right? Well, despite the fact that this product costs a bit more than Neutrogena and smells and feels wonderful while using it -- it doesn't produce the clear skin results of other products. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to the \\"corrective cleaner\\" name.
B005MT7I5O|5|Great stuff. Really the only cream I've found that works for facial outbreaks brought on by oil from your hair
B00K86E9PI|5|I am not a vain person but even I started to notice that I am aging... When given the opportunity to this out for my honest and unbiased review I was like Heck Yeah... I have notice this I am not getting any younger... my body tells me this but... now my face that is a different story... I am seeing less and less of those fine line that make you look older than you really are... I also notice that even though it is helping with those lines it isn't giving me that puffy look that some do... A very nice texture and not to greasy not to oily... An all around great serum but I do have a suggestion start it earlier so you don't play catch up like me :-)
B005EQO9SO|4|Powder offers good coverage, a nice finish, oil control, and it lasts.  The compact is very slim which is nice for my makeup bag but also means there is not a lot of product in the package.  The powder smells terrible however, so that will be a turn off for a lot of people.  Also, the applicator is pretty cheap feeling but it works well.
B00012NJNC|5|My boyfriend notices the witch hazel smell for about 2 minutes after I use them, but I don't care as this is the only thing to tame my adult acne.
B002C6TCYA|1|First of all, it's just a strong scent of peppermint. I get better exfoliating with other brand. Sorry, will not repurchase
B001615ZQG|5|Well made. Solid.  Will last a lifetime.
B003156NL6|5|This product does everything it says it does and works<br />as well as all their Rapid Clear products. If you have sensitive skin and want clear skin, this<br />is a really good product to try.
B00ID2SIM4|5|I loved the smell and it blends really well with my skin tone.
B00BQ9DU1K|3|The picture makes it look more like it's a tote size bag and that's what I was looking for not a handbag. I'm disappointed in the size
B00EYCAE9M|3|POOR QUALITY AND DESIGN.NO SUPPORT
B001AHJJJA|5|Great
B005GFIBP0|5|Excellent
B000C1ZB3I|4|I've been using Design by Paul Sebatian for many years. I get at least one or more compliments a day when I'm out and about. It's fresh aroma makes me feel springy. I recommend this highly
B001LEXKHY|5|Great product, used it on a fairly serious 2nd degree burn that was 2.5 inches long and almost an inch wide on my neck. Completely healed with almost no scarring in under 3 weeks. I cleaned with soap and water after the initial burn, and used only Manuka wound honey and sterile gauze after that. I did not use antibiotics or proxide or anything. I'm not saying that it will work for you or that you should treat your wounds the same as I have. Always follow your doctors advice. I would also add that I normally use raw honey that came from my own bee hives for wounds and burns. It has also worked very well, hard to say if this product was better, but research has shown that Manuka honey is very powerful stuff. We also used it for a large flap of skin removed from the palm of the hand. Same program, clean with soap and water, cover with Manuka Honey and sterile gauze. After 2.5 weeks completely healed without infection and minimal scarring. Try for yourself, if nothing else it smells nice and taste good.
B001ET76AI|5|I suffered from bad breath since I don't know when!!!  I was ashamed to be around people and talk without a mint and gum and oh let's not talk about waking up in the morning next to my bf!! Embarrassing!!!!!!! I went to Walgreens one day and seen this beautiful bottle and read it and tried it!! It was the best fricking $8.00 I have ever spent!!!! OMG I am confident now and I can talk whenever without gum and mints and it lasts all day long!! You guys this is really a life saver I can't believe it works!! I don't have a bad taste no odor and I'm just soooo happy with this product please this is such a blessing in my life right now!!! I feel confident and healthy!! Do buy if you are embarrassed or ashamed of your bad breath!!
B007M875OW|4|would give 5 stars if I could get that excited over soap.... smells nice. last a good amount. solid bar of soap, not full of air like store bought.
B00NFS3L5K|5|This bag is so cute I'm hesitant to use it.  It's just the right size to pop the essentials in my suitcase.  I'll probably put anything likely to spill in an even smaller bag in this one, just to keep it nice.
B00THESCSW|5|Great butter! Love it!
B00M25KFME|4|Good blades
B00GCQMSVA|3|The spray that comes with the product sprays in all directions making you waste a considerable amount of product. I tried spraying on face and then on palms but neither works well. Better to put a dropper I think.
B007EAML42|4|One came with my CPAP, and I found that it worked very well. Over the years I have worn out several and always go back for more.
B000BX1E4M|2|These products are not helpful in removing whiteheads or pimples.  The spoon extractor hole are too small and the tip is not very sharp.  The loop extractor works but require hard presses which hurt the skin.  I would not purchase this again!
B00GGAUL5W|5|Love this product.  Definite reduction in the appearance of wrinkes.  Wish it came in a clear container so I knew when I was running low.
B0010XUU9M|5|Being a man, I don't get a chance to use these, sadly.  Unless i wear makeup, but i don't.  I'm not that metro just yet.<br />The women in my household use this and claim they are quick, convenient, and handy.  In fact, these get used even when no makeup is applied just to get that clean/fresh feeling.<br />For waterproof mascara, its a bit hard to take out so you may need to also use a makeup remover along with this product.  For that extra fresh feel, wash your face even after using this.<br />5 stars! Highly recommended.
B00005A441|5|I just ordered my second set of these rollers.  My hair is naturally curly, and these rollers keep the frizz from taking over.  These rollers heat up so fast it is amazing.  I plug them in and within a few minutes thay are HOT.  I ordered the second set of rollers, because I have long, thick hair.  I didn't want to have to wait and reheat to do all of my hair, so I decided to splurge on a second set.  There are 8 large rollers and 4 super large rollers.  These sizes work great with my independent, unruly, naturally curly hair.  I blow my hair dry and then put in these rollers.  (People are amazed when I tell them my smooth hair is actually naturally curly.)  I would love to have a set of ALL super size, but the large work ok.  I do take one set of these rollers on trips with me, and they do not take up that much space as they are very compact.  I truly can't live without them, especially if I'm flying across the country for business, fun, etc.  If you have trouble with the pins that come with these rollers, it is worth the cost, in my opinion, to order the Conair super clips/ pro clips (multiple purpose clips) product link [ASIN:B00065AFP4 Conair SPC10X 10 Super Clips] or [ASIN:B001DCE1JU Conair Champion Salon Pro Roller Clips] which are 10 clips for about $7 and available on Amazon.com.  These make using these rollers \\"a walk in the park\\".  I just ordered a third set of these clips.  I had my first set for about 10 years, as they simply don't wear out.  I wanted to have 30 instead of 10, so after using my first 10 for ten years and my new 10 for two years, I finally ordered that 3rd set.  They arrived, and I'm thrilled.  I definitely rate the rollers and the clips a 5++.
B000052YN6|5|My daughter has acne prone sensitive skin that is extremely dry.  This lotion works perfectly for her. My skin is more on the oily side and this lotion is fabulous for me too. Its rich and creamy yet absorbs completely. I definitely would recommend it.
B00D2TVYVA|1|This is nothing more than waterproof mascara.  I would not recommend it.
B00SGELHF4|3|It's an okay platte , one color matches my skin fine , but they don't last long and they make look somewhat cakey , I use it only for blemishes then I use la pro girl conclear white is the best to me .
B00L83AI2S|4|I don't have an acne problem but I do get one or two during my monthly menstrual cycle. Initially I was a little skeptical about this product about whether or not it was effective and how it worked. I really like how easy the product is to use. Just wash your face or cleanse the area your going to treat. Peel the cover off the sticker and place it over the blemish, press for 30 seconds, and its as simple as that. They adhere to the skin well and stay on all night. I've yet to have one that has fallen off. They are sticky enough to stay on as you toss and turn  yet they peel easily off your skin leaving no glue/sticky residue behind. They're comfortable to wear to the point that I forgot I had them on. They are visible up-close, but not so noticeable that people would look twice in passing. The product seems to work best on pimples that are mature with a whitehead. Overnight, the initially translucent sticker had swelled and turned in the center, apparently working like a sponge drawing out the oil / pus from the pimple.There was a very noticeable reduction in the size of inflammation. Another application the very next evening and the pimple was almost completely gone by the following morning. Overall this product worked effectively for me but I think it can become costly for those that suffer from acne. Especially if they need to use it on more than one pimple that require multiple applications.
B00564TEQG|5|I got this as a gift recently from my girlfriend and I have had a life long problem with flakes so I was skeptical about it actually working as I've tried them all and not to mention being organic which I've never used a shampoo that was organic.  I'm happy to report that my flakes are gone, all gone, after a week of usage and I can start wearing dark shirts again without having to check all the time for flakes on my shirt.  Not only did it make my flakes go away but I had no redness for itchiness afterwards as I have a sensitive scalp so I would definitely order this and anyone else that has dandruff problem with sensitive scalp they should really check this out as it really is a life changer.
B004GWEG76|5|So far I have no complaints. I was looking for an aluminum free deodorant and I think I have found the one!
B002TQ4AO0|1|Regrets!!! The only words that comes n mind thinking about the item.<br />It does not cut as it should, the trimer part is not really existent…<br />In short, it’s a disappointment
B000QRFGP6|1|Doesn't work like it used to.
B002Z7EOOY|5|I purchased this product along with Olay Total Effects Body Wash, Moisturizing.  I start with this, the exfoliating wash and then, in the same shower, use the moisturizing one.  There is also an \\"in shower lotion,\\" which I use when I want my body super-moisturized.  I haven't needed to use after-shower lotions since I started using these products.  I am in my late 50s and I swear these products have changed my skin from dry to normal.  Love it!
B00LLGSVW6|5|The build quality and grip are top notch.
B00D6C8LRS|5|excellent smell not too stromg
B008RP6GGC|5|...Just wish it had a bigger capacity.
B005O9UQXI|5|I had used meloids in the past, but that product is no longer made.  Vocalzone meets and exceeds the effect that meloids had on my singing voice.  I use one about 30 minutes before I have to sing and my voice is strong and clear.
B00IKVHVVM|4|Very good
B00GC598UK|1|FAKE! Package was cut open and Beauty Blender was replaced with a fake. Rip off!
B004ALIOZ8|5|again, Kyoku makes a great mens product...its a two layer, an caffeine infused with plain on cucumber..one small squirt gets under both eyes, then the other goes over that and brightens that area since working 60 hour weeks, tends to wear a person out, but you can't tell  the circles under my eye, which Kyoku removes
B003XU8AMY|5|This product works as advertised. It is hard to get excited by an electric nose hair remover, but it will keep the bush out of your nose. So what else can you ask for............
B001BOISNU|4|This is a good product for clipper maintenance but you can not store it in a clipper bag on its side because it leaks. The oil is of great quality. The despenser neck works well and doesn't over saturate the clippers. Just wish it could be stored on side in clipper bag instead ofd having to be kept upright
B00LNOV8JO|5|I've been using this rosehip oil on my face with geranium essential oil and really like the way it absorbs quickly, leaving my face well-moisturized but not greasy.  It's only been a few weeks, but I think the appearance and health of my skin has improved since I started using it.
B0086VI9TE|4|These brush heads are pricey but they do the job quite well. We're very satisfied with them although since this is my first toothbrush of this type, i can't say these heads offer the best value.
B007C4SWH0|5|One of my friends was complaining that no matter what she used on her lips, they were always chapped.  I bought her this lip balm to see if it worked better.  She says this is the best lip balm she's ever used & in addition works beautifully on her cuticles.  Since then, I bought more for myself and other friends.  Good find!!
B005C4WPUW|5|unexpensive and good quality. This is my third one.
B00DFPQQZU|5|Stays put through eating and drinking and tastes and smells sooooo good. Anytime I'm around someone and put it on I get asked about it because the smell is so strong.
B003NCXXIS|4|the mangroomer is everything they claim that it dose. The only complaint that I have is the unit doesnt get as close an you really have to work at a close cut an the head could be a 1/2\\" to 1\\" wider, but its less painful then a wax cheaper than laser treatment so thats why it gets 4 stars
B00538TSMU|5|Seriously youll never come across a deal like this I love all my lashes n even gave some to all my girls so were fabulous together 1-5 day use each if u use them right n honestly 4 $ for one pair or 2 $ for alll these options :)
B005MG86TY|5|came quickly and as advertised
B0086VI9TO|4|Brushes are smaller than the brush that came with it but probably better to get into those smaller spaces.
B001J8DBTE|5|A+ product. Superior to anything I've ever used. I no longer need to use a styling gel.<br />Great delivery service. Thank you
B00C224BHC|5|It is small and very convenient. Ideal if u only want to carry some money, cards and cell phone with u... its sturdy and looks durable. the color is lovely! its a cute nice purse..very handy
B00IWYSBU2|5|I will never buy the high price razors again.
B00067YSLO|5|I love this straightener! I have just below shoulder length hair, so it doesn't take too long to do. It works great on my wavy/curly hair. It takes about the same time to dry as a blow dryer. I've also had less split ends since I started to use it because the heat isn't as damaging.
B001EJOPQG|5|I get blisters from the dentures since I have allergies to the material they are made of, with cushion grip after three years of not being able to wear my teeth I can now and I do not use any other glue or powers they stay in wonderful and the thin layer keeps the dentures material from touching my gums.
B0001ZR642|5|This nail file has a thin square shape to it.  I thought it would be flatter.  Regardless, it does work very well and I am pleased with my purchase.
B00HG1JFXY|5|This is a great product like the Ultra Labs Hair Surge Caffeine+ Hair Recovery Stimulating Shampoo.  These two products are good to buy together if you have thin, lifeless or dull hair.  Many of us know that caffeine wakes us up in the morning, and it also wakes up the hair and stimulates the scalp.  I never thought about using a product with caffeine until recently for hair, but it really works.  So, have some coffee in the morning and add this product with caffeine to your hair.  Your body and your hair will both be more alive.
B002BLDXAA|5|Very nice elegant shaving brush. Cant ask for anything better. Soft , lathers up  good.<br />I hang mine to dry.
B0000530HU|5|I have been using Aqua Velva for years and love it. My pharmacy and super market only carry the 3.5 oz bottles, so I was happy to locate the 7 oz size on Amazon. They delivered the 7 oz bottle in a timely manner, and I am well satisfied.<br /><br />navydoc
B00KSLK86M|5|The Lip Balm is amazing.<br />It does not get sticky or greasy, and lasts for a long time.<br />The mint flavor is pleasant and refreshing!<br />When I got the product I was a little upset with the size, but the quality is very good.
B004QSRLZ4|5|a nice tinted moisturizer  lessens redness without fake look. I do not breakout from  is always a plus.  will buy again for sure.
B002CVTVVY|2|When I purchased it and used for two weeks I absolutely loved it. Now it stopped working after 9 months.   141 dollars down the drain
B003WR3QSG|5|I have not had any problems with it so its very good
B0038KVGWK|5|I purchased this to 'touch up' my 'do on the road & minimize packing. Who wants to pay extra baggage fees when you can get by with a carry-on? This iron heats up fast, stows in it's cute heatproof zebra patterned pouch & weighs half of the 'home' models. Good for those with bangs/ends to turn under or wavy/curly hair that needs a couple of touch ups - it would take forever to do a whole head with this.
B003ZTVDBS|4|not sure how to review q-tips. they are what they say they are. they work. this was a great price and delivered for free. nothing to complain about.
B000VT54QA|3|I cut my hair and needed something to keep the curls up.  Maybe it's just me, but I stick it in and it feels like it's in there firm and then as the day or the event progresses, it just wiggle out....still working on it.
B0012V0HMC|5|An excellent product.  It is not greasy and my husband loves it.<br />I would recommend Kamill products to anyone. My daughter originally brought me the product from Germany.
B004OHQR1Q|5|These are my best buy yet. I made little ornaments on my christmas tree nails. I made flowers and hearts. great quality.
B0012X6MQA|5|works well, doesn't make your hair feel greasy.  really smooths split ends and is a great thermo-protector.  would def buy again!
B003CN78GG|4|Okay product, but I found a similar volume product for half the cost : Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection AgeDefy Advanced...<br />Haven't really seen or felt the volume
B00G4ENX1O|5|Great price  for this brand
B001FAYAA0|5|These boxes are great for storing my Tarot Card Decks.  They got here in pleanty of time, and now sit on my coffee table, each with it's own tarot deck inside.
B00D93E7RM|5|I've tried many self tanners and this is the absolute best...hands down!
B0009OAHC8|5|I have always been impresed with this product and i have recieved so many compliments from women of all ages. In fact a young woman loved it so much, she took the time to stop and ask what kind of cologne i was wearing; and when i saw her latter that same day and she told me she bought it for her fiance. All in all the product is one of my favorites--and it recieved it prior to the promised delivery date, awesome.
B001BAH8XU|1|These are not cone shaped but rather rectangular and do not fit in typical smoker houses with round circular bases. They are also not pine smelling but rather burnt wood smoke. They appear to be made out of pressed 2x4 (pine) sawdust. Not as advertised.
B007KPMO66|5|It's Moroccan oil. It only gets better from here. Everyone out their with or<br />without hair, buy this stuff. It's MAGIC.
B009L14B4U|5|These gift sets come in very high quality packaging and the product themselves are great. I bought many of these in different flavor and color combinations. They suit every woman on your gift list. This is a gift all of your female giftees will love and use everyday.
B007QCI1II|5|I love the way this oil smells- I have super fine, and damaged blonde hair, and it does leave it smooth and shiny without weighing it down too much. Occasionally it does tend to weight the top of my hair/roots down a bit, but never looks oily. I find the best way to use this is trying to avoid my roots and just concentrating on the ends of my hair.  Is great when you want to avoid tangles during the brush-out. I also think it has made my hair healthier, even when I skip a usage, the split ends aren't as bad as before I was using it.
B00B5JT1MI|2|liked the smell on the magazine sample, sultry and Egyptian  incent like, but the real thing is more rose like, and the sent is not long lasting.
B00NC08PXE|2|Looks super pretty in the tube.......total disappointment when applied. This gloss is simply stunning at first glance. Unfortunately, when applied it looks mediocre at best. The texture is nice. It's non sticky and comes with a big , thick tipped applicator. This would be a perfect gloss if it were true to color. It's barely purple and doesn't contain enough light reflecting pigments to even be considered to be &#34;holographic&#34;.
B007TTGN6A|5|Very nice nail decals.  They apply nicely and are long wearing. Would recommend to professionals great way to increase your profits on ail services.  Great product and seller.
B001ET76QC|5|I've been using this cream almost 30 years I hope Revlon never discontinues this item!!! I will buy this again.
B00BY7FISC|5|Excellent
B0065JCV84|5|Works best in my opinion on dry hair. Wanting to try the Firme Hold next
B005WKFS6E|1|it was broken and all my books were in this wondeful conditioner!!!:(((((((((((((((
B00IRD2AB4|5|Real nice
B00538TSMU|5|I absolutely love these lashes
B003H146PY|4|I was a big skeptic of the whole pheromone thing but I can honestly say it this product does attract women, they don't come running to you like a pack of wolves but what I noticed when in the grocery store all the females were more talkative, they looked at me and were very flirty. I will be buying again and it does smell good also, hope this helps...
B00O1B8GWI|5|Great price for the quantity.
B001QY8QXM|5|Saving millions of dollars using these fine, premium blades. Astra single edge put's the BOOTS to the Gillette blade rip off.
B007ONF4OI|5|An excellent product and with an extra 4 pads an excellent value. I would recommend this merchant to anyone.a very pleasant experience.
B00152S7AW|5|So good
B001131AJA|5|I must say that the only things I've used from this care pack are the body butter and the toning oil. I have been using them since I found out I was pregnant and am 8 months along. I think it feels nice, and even though it's a little greasy, it doesn't/hasn't stained my clothes. I will say that in the first trimester I couldn't use it every day because the smell was nauseating. However, I do think it has a nice citrus smell to it. Oh, and I have gotten stretch marks. I think if you are bound to get them you are going to get them--regardless of what you rub on.
B005A6SZB0|5|Best bath and Body product never used by wife and daughter.  We would buy more in the near throughout the year.
B00VVWNMLA|5|Good stuff! Smells great. I get all the bitches now!
B003ES7GRA|5|I initially thought this was a copy, but it seems to be 100% original. Strangely, it does not come with the box or the DVD, but otherwise matches the descriptions from others. A quick run through You Tube and you can see all of the different styling options easily enough anyway. Have had this for quite a few months now and it still works good as new.
B001LM0JMA|5|My mother bought this perfume for me YEARS ago when she was in england... its been about 5 or 6 six years and I still have a little left in the bottle. I always made sure that I only sprayed it a few times. Lol, I figured now Im older..I can look for it online.. and.... I FOUND IT!! I'm so excited.. lol it hasn't come yet.. but I'm sure my boyfriend will love it..:))
B00479DRFA|5|handy, clean, and effective--I love these for home or travel
B005TT8Q4O|2|Bottle leaks a lot
B004LIG6SC|4|I was real excited to find out that Khloe and Lamar were coming out with a unisex scent so I had to buy it for my husband and myself.  He first sprayed it on him and I loved the smell on him, very clean smelling on him; but my first impression was \\"this is a man's cologne.\\" I then sprayed it on myself and at first I smelt like a dude but later it had a very nice feminine sweet scent to it, which I was REAL happy about!  I can tell you that this is this 100 times better than CK One (I was never a fan). I would recommend this for sure!  I still love the Kim K perfume more but this is perfect for both man and a woman!
B002TPQPEE|5|So many colors, great package and very pigmented. Great quality. I love makeup and am very conscious about how the quality is, its great. Take me forever to use all the colors :)
B00Y1KWDG4|3|This works well however I wish it smelled more almond like.
B0002NIAC0|1|After wonderful recommendations from friends, I had high hopes of being able to use this product. However, I am very disappointed in the  exfoliating day lotion. It caused a burning sensation and rash on my face.
B00KPCXUHI|5|Great eyelash curler!
B00HWFBYUG|5|Paid more for this elsewhere; should have gotten it here. Got it to use on the fly for refreshing my face. Good size and has all the colors I need. I tend to wear extremely light makeup, so this works well. Just the right amount of shimmer without being overpowering.
B00B4YY1GU|3|Too shiny. Makes you look like sweat
B0034KYDSI|4|My friends grand daughter loved this. I thought it would be a great purse item. Its has a little of all the quick items a young girl needs to freshen up
B005D1UI1W|5|GOOD STUFF
B003BMGAFI|3|The material is good, not too cheat. Great for makeup application.
B004X8A884|5|Great for face powder or body powder - an excellent size for either. A soft, smooth, comfortable material that easily allows for powder dusting. A good price for a good, quality product. I highly recommend this puff.
B0063FK83U|5|good product
B0066H7U40|5|This is a high quality shampoo and conditioner.  It is very thick and not watered down, like most products.  I would highly recommend it.  I would purchase it again in a heartbeat!
B00390DN34|4|works great, even as a dry shampoo
B00BUCNG08|5|So far so good - sprays nicely, has protected my daughters skin!
B008OWV1K4|5|I love this highlighter, it's a staple in my makeup bag. I have really dark circles (must be hereditary) and this pen works it's magic everytime. I look well-rested when I use it & it stays put all day.
B000TCD51A|4|Use these for my RDA. Work great!
B000J6C2CY|5|Moisturizer not greasy and has not caused me any breakouts has a little soapy smell (doesn't smell like soap on your face the whole day just when your squeezing it out of the bottle)but this is by far the best moisturizer i've tried for myself.  The AHA glycolic 8% cream is nice too, it's helped fade my old breakouts.  I wear it only at night and apply it 15 minutes after washing my face, as suggested on the bottle.
B008OUYQE4|5|the color is just a tad darker then what they show here. With some good make-up setter it'll do great.
B0014C1XQI|5|This product made my hair silky and smooth it is the best thing I've used to flat iron my hair with. I have been natural for almost 5 years but I love to wear my hair straight and wrap it up at night when I wash and condition my hair I use this product after I blow dry and before I flat iron and it is the best thing ever I highly recommend this product to my sistas out there with natural hair if you like to have the straight look trust me you will love it
B002VBTNA4|5|My hair stylist stopped caring Kevin Murphy products. I am allergic to so many shampoos. The pure ingredients of this shampoo guarantee that my scalp doesn't break out! Happy to find this product!
B00PDCZHDU|5|I lost all my hair to an illness that robs my cellular energy so things like hair are not a priority and I lost it all over my body. I have raynaud's and other issues, which add to the impact on the hair follicle, and using Red Light therapy is just the BEST for so many things these days! So many of us cannot take the drugs on issue today and have to look further and reach deeper for help. I love Bionase to cure my rhinitis (do a g00gle for the best price, it is just plastic, wire and diodes and places charge too much), I love the DPL for my muscle aches -- and reducing wrinkles and fine lines ;) but they changed their timer and added $$$ for the new model when it's the same as the old one except for the how long the cycles last :( Boo for that. The Warp 10 is mind-blowing for trigeminal neuralgia and helps arthritic joints immediately. These guys 'came up with' the technology for NASA (Tina Karu was first ;), which is now used throughout the medical and even navy seals carry these clunkers in the field. They are hard angled and difficult for the very arthritic hands they are supposed to help. Much easier to make a DPL hand sandwich in those cases... It's their Warp 75 helps cure sick kids who are dying from side effects of cancer therapy (this one beeps so loud the adrenaline rush counters some of the goodness, imo)... the good health outcome news just goes on and gets better. So when I was losing my hair I bought one of these (I could do that before my illness made me broke :( (Healthcare in Canada gets you just as broke as healthcare in the USA), anyway, short version this works. Look at my picture taken this summer. I have amazing hair. It is one of life's simpler joys but I love what has happened to it and how strong it is. I only wash with Aveeno Dry Skin bar soap and use a wire brush for static. No other products needed. Soap, water, brush. I need to learn to make soap, it's too $$$ these days.
B008A612JO|5|All good
B00F3MUQ72|5|Very sturdy and roomy, zippers appear to be well stitched and strong  - we have not traveled with it yet but it looks like it will fit our needs perfectly as we are joining the &#34;ONE BAG&#34; Club for all our travel from now on - no more baggage fees for us!
B0018FIDUK|5|This is a very nice sample with easy designs for beginners.  It did take awhile for me to figure it out, but once you do, its easy and addicting!  Their \\"special\\" polish is thicker than regular nailpolish.  You also have to scrape and stamp quickly or else it wont work.  Seems like their polish dries a lot quicker.  Highly recommended kit before you invest in more Konad products.
B00563K6VO|5|I use a flat iron and have never quite gotten the hang of ironing my hair without burning wrist and fingers. I use one on both hands. I can go faster because I don't have to be so careful. Great invention.
B005EO5IB8|5|Love this innovative approach towards body moisturization! My husband refused to use any of the previous cream sand lotions I bought him because he didn't like getting his hands all &#34;dirty.&#34; Not only does this applicator help keep hands out of the way, but the seaweed formula is really wonderful for eczema and dry skin. Even though it does have a strong smell when you apply it to a large area, I'm just too grateful to the founder for coming up with this applicator idea to take points off!
B00BBML2S0|5|love at first sight :)
B002Q7VUWM|5|This product has done everything I hoped for in concealing those annoying &#34;empty&#34; spots on my head.  It matches my coloring almost perfectly and nothing feels better than knowing my hair is looking good.  Embarrassing thin areas are gone.  Co-workers comment on how much hair I have for a woman my age.  (I'm a senior citizen)
B001GIOV82|4|Good at moisturizing the eye area but didn't notice any diminished under eye circles. It's one of the better eye creams out there but not the greatest. It's great that it's got natural ingredients and smells pleasant.
B005DU1H54|5|Hair feels manageable especially because I process it often. Great deal. Genuine ptoduct.
B000Z65AA4|2|I read the reviews that said this pinched them and never thought it would apply to me with my vast experience using cheap and expensive eyelash curlers.  I figured it was the actual crimping part of the tool that was pinching but in my experience it was the part on the side of the curler that slides up and down the handle of the tool that grabbed hold of my inner under eye skin bringing on instant tears.  Like other reviewers have said it could just be my eye shape but it take too much concentration and fear to use without pinching myself.  I also never felt that it got a hold of my outer lashes very well.
B000H706O6|5|Have been using it forever...the best mascara there is....
B00HSE4WJG|2|they are ok brush, noting special,
B001MP0P48|5|Perfect for my needs.
B003EMLDYI|5|glad to have it its great
B008Z6B1YK|5|Pure Unrefined African Shea Butter is another wonderful natural skin care product.  Used on dry skin and eczema it does miracles.  It has an almost immediate effect on healing.<br />It can be used on the entire body for improving texture and skin tone.<br /><br />For active working people it works very good as a protectorant for the hands.  Whether gardening, carpentry, or automotive a small amount will prevent exposure to extreme dryness and seal out dust and dirt.<br />When finished cleaning is much easier.  Reapply to maintain.<br /><br />One pound of this product in its convenient container is truly a bargain.  It has a long shelf life.<br />My order came from Practical Magic quickly and was carefully packed.
B006GWDBZ2|5|I finally took the plunge and purchased this LED light so that I could do my nails at home.  It has easily paid for itself already.  Let me preface this with the fact that I am not amazing at doing nails (especially trying to paint my dominant hand) but using this with the gelish nail polishes makes for a professional looking manicure.  I actually find it pretty easy to do french manicures which I love at home.  The ability to use nail polish to fix errors after you have cured the lower layers of polish is the best thing ever and the fact that after the polish has been set with the light you can't mess it up... awesome!  I know it is an investment but with each gel manicure running $25-50 depending on where you get it done this will pay for itself in a few months.
B000F4USF8|5|this trimmer is awesome. Many different guard settings. Once you turn it on, the guard locks into place so it wont slide while you're trimming. Has a secondary fine tip trimmer built in that you can pull out and use. Trims all the little stubble off your face. Makes it look like you shaved rather than trim. Its that close. Waterproof-ness is no joke. you can dunk this in water and nothing happens. Excellent shaver!
B001DNE3KQ|5|Cuts close and smooth. Its fairly quite. I would purchase it again but would like to try a 4-blade. $blades must be way better.
B004UCLDY6|5|I love this stuff on my natural twa, it helps my curls to pop even more while adding moisture.
B000TCD51A|5|Perfect,  and shipped quickly.
B0096UZBE0|4|Palmer's is the greatest hand lotion, especially the concentrated kind in the tube, and this THE BEST hand soap.  It smells great, it is softening, and it's always my first choice.  It's too bad it's expensive, and it was better when it came in the rounder containers because these flat ones fall over easily.  Why is it the lotion, the cocoa butter tubs, and the lip balm are all readily available, and the hand soap pump is such a pain to find and buy?  5 stars or more for the product, 3 stars for availability, averaging out to 4.
B00J3XW2KQ|4|Great product!!!
B006TJ7M70|5|Was thoroughly impressed! A little goes a long way
B00NQIDF7S|2|Didn't do a thing.  Used religiously for months.
B00JBE78CE|5|VERY GOOD customer service, product wasn't really meant for my hair, but it seems like very HIGH quality and would work with smooth, lighter hair.
B006LTTBMW|5|Love this product.  Perfect for making lotions
B000WI0640|5|Strong and durable shears. You can feel the quality when you touch it. A little small for my boyfriend's fingers, but perfect for mine.
B000FDXWEI|5|We use this in our walkin closet as it is has a vaulted ceiling and we have a 3rd tier of clothing.  It works great to grab the hangered item and remove it from the rod or to put it back.
B000HX2L6Q|5|Having re-ordered this for at least seven years speaks for itself.  This, and an hyaluronic serum are all I ever add to a clean face!
B0014LL3FK|5|Now I buy this regularly.  It moisturizes my working hands.
B003CTTZQQ|5|I was skeptical as always when trying something new but I prefer to try products that are natural. I am african-american with natural 4B hair. My hairline was thinning due having my hair bleached & then dyed in July and the thinning was very noticeable. I bought this product & within in three weeks my hairline is growing back in beautifully. I can't speak for others but it has worked for me. Usually I wash/condition my hair and then oil my entire scalp with the castor oil. It is very thick & a little goes a long way. On my wash day I wear a plastic bag on my head over night to seal the moisture in (otherwise known as the greenhouse effect). Then I usually just put the castor oil around my thinning hair line daily. Funny thing is I have what I consider an unusual hairline where it dips back near my right/left temples and hair has started to grow in that area as well! I have never put the castor oil all over my hair b/c I dont see the need to do that. As for the scent, I personally dont mind the scent & I have a very sensitive nose. It does have the scent of ashes however I also use another moisturizer on my actual hair that has the scent of fresh baked pound cake/cookies and all I ever smell is that. If you have ever used shea butter, jojoba oil, etc you probably wont mind the scent of the castor oil. Overall I am pleased with the product and will continue to use this product even when my hairline has grown all the way in. As with all products I believe that no one product produces a miracle and you must be patient and have a regimn. I wanted my hairline to grow back so I am being very deligent about how I use the product. :)
B000GDF49I|4|So far this is working well,, and not breaking my face out
B000K6CXCC|5|I use it over and over again.  Lady Primrose is the best hand wash!  Just wish they would bring back the liter size bottles since I refill my own container with the soap.
B00HK5ZQL6|3|Like
B008HRYMKC|5|I have been using individual lashes for 30+ years.  I have used several different manufacturers and these lashes are the easiest to remove from the package (the tip re hair dryer is great…but not too close :) Wish they would come out with the short double flare (great for inside and outside lashes…close to nose and temple).  When using Duralash and Ardell I have always had a lot of waste due to damage from the heavy glue that adheres them to the package.  These are much, much better and the price speaks for itself.
B00023IXDQ|5|bought for wife and she loves it
B00EKIMVVO|3|This product is OKAY, it's not great, not horrible. For the price I paid, I'm kicking myself right now. Thank goodness it was a gift card. Almay is wayyyyyyyy better than this, even MAC, and also half the price. This stuff is clumpy and very thick,not something that I would purchase again. Makes you think who writes these reviews sometimes.
B00I1HAOV4|5|Wife bought me some this because she liked the way it smells.  However, it seems that the local stores are no longer carrying it.  So I got on Amazon and ordered a case.  Great stuff...and if the wife is happy...everyone is happy!
B003UH0528|5|I purchased this brush after using the one that came with my BareMinerals set--and what a difference! The BareMinerals one shed bristles everywhere, and I would end up picking off strays from all over my face. I have never had an issue with this one, not a single bristle lost! Color me satisfied.
B00SADPJJQ|1|Very cheaply made ... Broke the first day ... The sponge was very hard... Save your money or look elsewhere
B008G29BYK|1|This brush was not good for thick, curly hair...
B00G5L867C|5|The cost of a cavity is triple the cost of this tooth brush.  It's more than worth it so I don't have to brush my kids teeth for them.
B00L1KFQKC|4|My daughter has dry scalp.  We received this last week and we already see a significant improvement in her dandruff.  I
B00J7Q1AV6|5|Good Clippers
B00BBZZOTU|1|They dont work. Doesnt stay put at all.
B000FKHNNW|5|I had used this in the past and wasn't really sure if it was doing anything as I was working out heavily and eating right. However, when I stopped using it, I definitely noticed a difference in my skin tone. I highly recommend it!
B007M0LGL8|1|not at all what was described wig is a lot of money  for what you get it sheds and thin in some parts color is not what you get warning
B000V2ACHI|3|Its working good to keep my hair style, but its causing my hair to fall!
B002Z7UQ1Y|4|This is not a bad sampler pack that are meant for double edge razor. By far, the Feather blades were the sharpest blades in the pack and favorite. You definitely need to shave carefully with these blades or else you would nic your face pretty bad. The Gillette and Bic blades where the next in line. The blue bird didn't really do it for me. Everyone has a different preference of what they demand from their blades and this sampler pack provides four different types.
B001991T2Y|2|Okay bottles. The top gets unscrewed easily, which causes leakage.
B003FXTYEW|5|Found it here.  Love the no scent.  Even though it says &#34;Advanced Solid&#34; it is the &#34;cream&#34; that I was looking for.
B001VMQLXG|5|metal frame as advertised, and they really do have a great hinge feature. Very nice for the price, and good magnifying strength.
B0001VUHMO|5|This is not the first time I purchased this, but I was using another product for a while instead of this.I recently went back to it and I am reminded why I loved it so much. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave you feeling greasy, it works well under makeup and makes my skin feel great.It doesn't clog my pores making me break out and soothes my dry irritated skin instantly. I love it.
B001LGXAL8|5|This really helps me to keep my complexion clear!
B008T85MU8|4|useful!
B001CC1VV2|3|I love asian skincare, so of course I had to try this cleanser. I even like the name, Perfect Whip.  However, this is only good if you don't wear makeup or remove your makeup prior to washing your face.<br /><br />Yes, this cleanser is fabulously foamy, but just because it is foamy, doesn't mean it is removing impurities.  The good thing is, you only need to use a teeny tiny amount and the cleanser will create an incredibly rich lather, and doesnt dry out the skin.  I can use this cleanser in the morning and it seems fine, however I can't use it at night.  The bad thing about this cleanser is that it doesn't completely get rid of makeup.  I wear foundation and powder and even though I washed my face twice with this cleanser, I had to use about 6 cotton balls with toner to get rid of all the remaining traces of dirt and makeup left on my skin.  I am breakout prone, so I like to make sure all makeup/dirt is removed from my face before bed.  To me, if there is still dirt or makeup residue on your face after cleansing, then that is not a good cleanser, which is why I don't recommend this cleanser if you wear foundation, concealer, or powder.
B00CNTJHQO|4|My girlfriend recently got on a sulfate free hair product kick, so seeing how it has benefited her hair I decided to give one a go. However, I need one that can handle my itchy scalp and dandruff issues. So after researching different products and reading countless reviews, I went with Maple Holistics, Haven't regretted it, even after I accidentally ordered two bottles instead of one. Product gives a nice thick lather, unlike a lot of sulfate free shampoos, and it smells great (a bit like Vick's vapo-rub, but I love that smell) and works as good or better on my scalp than other things I have used in the past, including T-Gel. I give it 4 stars only because of the price, I will reevaluate that after I finish a bottle to see how long it lasts.
B0073YKJHK|5|this is my second time order. I followed directions and worked great!<br />Now, since I know its not an issue, I leave it on for max time, 10min I think and works even better. Just wish I could buy the balm separately.<br />For the few items on the market, coughNaircough, this is by far the best.
B000E7YK7S|5|IMO this is THE male oriental, the one that all others must be judged by, and that most later examples of the genre are probably ripoffs of.<br /><br />\\"Habit Rouge\\" means \\"red jacket,\\" of the sort that fox hunters wear. This scent is supposed to make you feel like an aristocrat driving off for a week at the family chateau in a Bentley. It assuredly does.<br /><br />What Guerlain apparently did here was to take the classic formula for a \\"Russian leather\\" -- leather, citrus, spices, amber and vanilla -- and add a few floral notes and a lot of sandalwood to turn it into an oriental -- or something like that.<br /><br />If you like this, you should also get a scent that they aren't selling on Amazon, so I suppose I can mention it here  -- Elsha 1776. Just type the word \\"Elsha\\" into your search engine and there you'll find it. As far as I know, these people are making the last of the classic Russian leathers that can be bought at a reasonable price. I've had a huge 8-oz amber jug of this stuff on my dresser for years. \\"Russian leather\\" is a classic no amateur perfume historian should miss, since it's the basis for so many other scents that have been derived from it -- including Gentleman, which I also review.<br /><br />Some seem to think that Habit Rouge smells \\"feminine.\\" Well, someone on Basenotes pointed out that Sean Connery was a fan of this stuff, so that settles that. A woman CAN wear it, but she probably has to be a certain type -- early middle age, brainy, independent minded, but still relentlessly sexy, and proud of it all. Heck, my cousin even wears this at breakfast, but then when she was a kid she was a model.
B0073RQMXC|5|Easy to use and effective
B001F51TDG|5|I like that it's spf25. Could become a little oily though. It works well. I use it on top of regenerist micro sculpting serum, before I put on my sheer B&B liquid foundation. Works wonder.
B0084HJPYI|5|The service with Amazon is very good. The cream It's work good.my skin look better,
B004SO2SVI|5|I have found that while wearing this product women and men seem to be more open and engaging with me.  I highly recommend PherX.
B004OHQR1Q|5|Very easy to use, good quality as well. They came in really fast in the mail and i've been using them a lot. Love them :D
B00ARF44O6|5|My husband's old one gave out and wouldn't hold a charge anymore. To replace it this was the closest model. I was a little skeptical when I saw it on Amazon as it looked nothing like the old one but times change and this one does the job for him. He does have to go over the area twice instead of once because the width of the trimmer is smaller than the old one which was wider but the dial up is nicer on this one.<br /><br />If you're replacing one of the old Norelco beard trimmers, this is your best bet.
B003PDI2QI|5|Good, but expensive.
B000KOUJZW|5|good product = using it for crafting
B000HQ0L2E|5|I've been using these for a couple years now, bought a new one because my old one finally bit the dust.  This thing is the most fabulous invention, if you have back hair shame.  Buy this thing!  NOW!
B007G8S4I4|5|This brand has always lived up to its expectations.  You can not go wrong with a brand as well respected as Sebastian.  You get what you pay for.....
B003NXTU0M|5|Tried and true I love this stuff. All three pregnanancies and minimal stretch marks. I love the smell it is so comforting.
B0000DEYQ4|5|These were a real find. I decided to give these curlers because, quite honestly, I could afford them. I got them, prepared them, and rolled them into my hair without burning my fingers at all! This was surely some sort of magic. I've never used a hot roller that didn't make me pay with blisters. So I waited the allotted time and took them out. Amazingly, I had beautiful curls that lasted until the next day. I'm so excited about this buy that I've told everyone I know about them. Like I said I was confused as to how they did what they did but I've decided I don't need to know I just need to keep using them. Oh and get this!!!!!!!!!!! No hair damage!!!! I guess that will be in my title. Ladies and or gentlemen you can not go wrong with these!
B001DD894M|5|Before using this stuff,I stuck to the cheap shampoos such as suave for men. I made the switch and I am very glad I did. It leaves your hair feeling clean but still very soft. The best part about this shampoo is that the peppermint conditioner leaves an awesome tingly feeling on your scalp for good amount of time. You really do pay for quality and now I can see why this stuff is better than the cheap shampoos.  I definitely recommend!
B006T078NM|4|It all came in a very timely manner. I am happy with the product.
B000XE6336|5|I feel 16 again!! Love it, love the price, love how quickly it arrived, and I love how genuine it smells. It doesn't last a long time but that's OK by me.
B004VNHINO|3|Way too sweet smelling for me.  It kinda gets the back of my throat.  It's that gardenia thing, you know?
B00P9RAFEU|5|nice mask, skin feels soft.
B002G57YNS|1|This compact can be purchased at any major department store or online at clarins for $36.  I can't imagine how anyone can sell this for $86!!!!  Beware.
B0002QNMUW|1|This does very little and has no color.. WASTE of money. If you want something that does a little just like this but actually has a color payoff buy Nyx lip plumping gloss. It costs maybe $3 dollars and does the same thing but actually is a great color payoff..  Shows just cause it costs more doesn't mean it's better...
B006U9D6D8|1|i don't know whether i like them or not because i haven't received it yet.i ordered it especially for the eyelash comb but i will be using the other brushes too if and when i receive them.
B0058BPBNM|5|I love this mask. It's absolutely wonderful. Wonderful for oily/combination skin.  Using twice a week is a must! :) it's better to use alone at night. Not needing to put moisturizer or night cream after mask. Maybe eye cream but that's about it. :)
B00444WFW4|2|I have used a BabylissPro Nana Titanium iron for several years and loved it, when it quit working I immediately ordered a new one.  My previous iron was the same model as the 1¼\\" one, just a different color.  I thought the pink would be fun and the U-Style looked like a nice bonus.  Unfortunately the 1¼\\" iron completely quit heating after only a few uses (I am hoping I just got a bad iron and the Babyliss quality I am used to hasn't changed).  The U-Style seemed like a nice product until I actually used it on my hair, my hair got stuck in the plates, didn't like this product.  I have returned this and reordered the original version I previously had.
B006B7WOVY|5|I love it! Wear lips, cheek, or fave. Go as light and go as dark ar one pleases. i love the vintage packaging too!
B005E0BOBA|5|Great to hold the tape in place, and help under eye area feel better.  Accepts glue dots easily, with no lint.  Helps soften tape for easy removal.
B008AM2PGM|1|This left streaks on me. What color did stay, came off in the pool. I read so many reviews and tried to make sure I was putting it on the right way and all. It just didn't work for me.
B00NMOS058|5|The best pads I have ever used!<br />My pores seem smaller and skin is smoother!
B002SHXO4M|5|I received my order a few days ago and have used it 4 times already.  The product really does whiten your teeth.  I could see a big difference after just one use at 20 minutes.  The mouth tray is not the most comfortable, but it is worth it to see your teeth so white after only a few uses.  I have already recommended this product to family and friends.  I also didn't have any gum or teeth soreness after using.
B000U6I6Q4|5|Just apply soap and use the green side first and then the white side. It really does help keep my feet from being so dry and cracked.
B00I99P1V2|1|whatever they sent me don't freaking stick to my face there clear stencils you have to hold. bull crap
B001RQI512|3|I thought the oil smelled realllly yummy. Felt oily in my hands, no surprise there! When I put it in my hair while it was wet, I didn't notice much difference but I would caution someone trying this for the first time NOT to put too much in the hair - you only need a bit.    I felt it's silky effect when my hair was DRY, which was a wonderful softness, not greasy. My hair did take a bit longer to dry. (I have shoulder length hair)    I thought the product was OK. I used the small sample size and I thought that was sufficient to see if I liked it enough before buying the big expensive size and it was. I don't think it's any worse or really better than any others, since the ingredient list has a bunch of silicone derivatives, I was disappointed with that since I thought I was getting this exotic OIL and I think there is actually very little of the oil in there. I read up on all the infomercials about it and on their official site and they didn't mention that it is mostly silicons. :::shrug:::    I have tried other things like Cowboy Magic that have similar ingredients and did the same thing for MUCH cheaper - not with that yummy scent though!!    I can see how I might like to keep a product like this around on days when my hair is feeling unruly. I don't think it improved my hair overall, I only felt the silky effects on days I used the product.    I did really like the seller though. VERY prompt shipper and even sent out a smaller sample with the one that I purchased which was an excellent bonus. Would definitely purchase other product from this seller again!!
B005GQV0CU|1|Received the wrong item...😞
B001E1XWCM|3|The razors are very sharp, but the first cut of a block of wood kills the cutting edge. I also have CRL razor blades and compared them again before writing this review, because I really want to make sure I do not mislead you. Treet went to trash after the first cut. CRL was sharp after 3 cuts and stay on my workbench.
B005BEF5EQ|5|Arrived promptly and was just what I ordered. This was an item I previously bought at my hairdresser's, so I knew what I was buying. This product makes my hair dry faster, hopefully causing less damage.
B008X0YCY4|5|Love them. I need these for perfect brows and I can achieve that with these stencils. They're not flimsy like other ones I.ve had.
B0043OYFKU|5|I love this product. It washed face gently and made my face smoother. I used it three times a week and I can feel my face brighter then before.
B008Y3P2FI|5|What more can I say about &#34;Honey B&#34; soap..my first introduction to this brand from Scottish Fine was from another competitor website. Then last year or 2013 a vendor was selling a four set at a 2.5 oz size for 17.00. I had to lunge at this deal at nearly 9.00 for 10.5Oz..Simply one of the best soaps around..
B004HFBC9W|1|[[ASIN:B004HFBC9W Chi Deep Brilliance Digital Titanium Hair Styling Flat Iron 1\\" Orange]]  I owned the original Chi flat iron for 5 years before it died.  I decided to try this model because of the good reviews and to save a little money.  I was disappointed the moment I unpackaged it. The exterior is cheap plastic that gets hot enough on the plastic that you can burn yourself while using it.  I intended to return it after using it the first time, but due to return shipping costs and restocking fees, I would've paid $30 for my \\"trial use\\" so I kept it.  I've been using it daily for only 6 months - was hoping to get at least a year out of it - and it died.  I was in the middle of styling my hair when I noticed it was off.  I tried to turn it back on - nothing.  I tried the reset button - nothing.  I let it cool off and tried again - nothing.  Do not be lured by the pretty colors and low price!  Spend the extra money on the ORIGINAL Chi Flat Iron by Farouk - you will not be diappointed.  I'm so skeptical of the low prices fo the Originial Chi Amazon, that I'm going to Trade Secret to get mine - even though I will spend twice as much.
B001AN0UTC|5|I am so glad that I purchased this product in addition to the mineral foundation: ) I get compliments on my \\"foundation\\" when I go places and the mineral veil tops it off.  The Product was shipped in great condition and came shortly after I placed the order. I will be purchasing this product again.
B00GUNYDAE|3|These worked great for helping heal my cracked soles, but the stiching came loose after a few wears.
B00FH3YARY|5|I like im I have 10 years ago with him its best for me I love NIVEA
B000XVSNTQ|5|A good razor and a good value. Can be used just about anywhere. Would recommend the set for a good trial run of the Venus Embrace series.
B00BUQHS9O|5|Awesome soap!
B002GJTYDW|5|Without a doubt the best shave I have had.  Easy on the skin because of the Nivea cream.  I shave my whole head, so the razor has to be easy to handle.
B004IUN7JO|5|This was a really great crop. Did the two step process two days ago with Dulhan henna for the first time. I'm for sure going to keep doing the process! My hair is shiny and feels really healthy from the total process after deep conditioning. I naturally have dark hair but the henna stained it to a burgundy which I don't like. This indigo did the trick and my hair is now really dark! Love it!
B0081A2X6A|5|Nice color
B004D281UM|4|A little too strong for my skin, Gives me some redness.
B00BSGV5Y0|5|great product helps lift the eye lid if you have droopy lids, love it
B000Q37M5M|4|I was hesitant to purchase this dryer after reading some of the unfavorable reviews but I'm very pleased with it so far. I can't vouch for the longevity yet, time will tell. It was very easy to assemble but not super sturdy. I'd recommend being careful while assembling. As I was attaching the legs, a small plastic part of the wheel lock (lever) broke off in my hand. I was bummed (that's why my rating is 4 stars) but the broken piece doesn't really affect anything as far as my needs are concerned. The dryer itself works really well and the high/ionic setting heats up quickly. Has a slight rattle sound when I first turn it on but it's not bothersome in my opinion. This dryer is perfect for my deep conditioning treatments and the adjustable height is nice. Makes it easy to position behind any chair. Also love the &#34;Purple People Heater&#34; logo - cute!
B005D7YJF2|5|i really like that there are no parabens in it, great smell too, It was on sale makes it even better.
B00AO4E9DG|3|I don't really notice a different when using this product. My hair is a little smoother after blow drying but not dramatically different. I hope this product is working and actually protecting my hair, I just can't tell.
B007ZJJ2JE|5|This is a lovely product! It is light and sweet and lasts all day! Will buy over and over again!
B00GU57Q5G|3|Well to start I use it on my face, and when I would use the one that looks like a brush the one with the bristles. I HURTS my face! Like it would rub me. But if you put it on low or off, and just scrub it on your face it works perfectly fine.
B002L0BMIG|5|i got these because i got tattoos on my forearms and have t cover them for work. These are great they keep your arms cool and granted they get more attention then my actual tattoos but that's not the point. i recomend getting these if you have to cover your tattoos for work
B0013945H6|5|I buy it for my husband whose hair is thinning significantly.  It really makes a difference how his hair looks and seems to have slowed down the thinning process.
B008L4DCZW|1|too expensive for 0.15 fl.oz  I think the picture on web site is misleading.
B000JG7C06|5|The best. It has been impossible to find for several years. I am so glad it is back.
B000RFST9C|5|This has been the favorite of many for a long time. There is a replacement item for it, which is much cheaper. I cannot believe anyone would try to sell this, discontinued or not, for $30!
B00021CLIQ|4|I did not see any visible results until three weeks after using this product.  Once a week for three weeks of use has changed the look of my skin.  I noticed this morning that my skin looks clearer and has a glow to it.  I've also used Philosophy's Purity cleanser.  Maybe it's the combination, but I am definitely seeing results.  The only negative is that it is messy to use.  Three steps, drippy goo and foam on your face, 3 minutes, etc.  But if you are willing to dedicate some time, you won't be disappointed with this product.  It may take some time before you notice anything significantly different but I am very pleased with the results.
B00JYGEOVW|5|Smells like the original
B004BD0ZJI|5|I never did use makeup on a regular basis.  So my skills are rusty -- and that's being kind.  This eyeliner goes on easily and smoothly.  I am African-American and the look with this pencil is subtle, not over the top.  Glad I made the purchase.
B00BN39J4Q|1|Poor quality....flimsy broke first day I used it... I had a couple from long time ago and am not able to find them, I only have a few left...so I saw these online.... anticipated they would be the same as I have... much smaller and thinner,,, immediately broke when I went to use it in my hair. The picture of the person putting one in her hair depicts a much bigger bun pin then what you receive. I wouldn't waste my money on these... try something else.
B006TOPJ9S|4|I am sewing a veil to attach to the comb.  It was inexpensive and will work perfectly for the hour I intend to wear it
B003RR4A2M|2|I bought this in January 2012. In the beginning it worked fine but now it's March (approximately 2.5 months later) and I noticed that the flat iron only works for 10-20 seconds until it automatically shuts off while I'm straightening my hair. I tried resetting but it still continues to shut off.    Steps I took to reset as provided by [...]  1. unplug iron, wait 10 seconds and plug in again.  2. Hold down the power for button for 20 seconds.    Now the warranty from this seller has expired and I'm left with a useless flatiron. Very annoying! My recommendation is to buy from a seller that will stand by their product and take care of their buyers by providing a longer warranty replacement or return policy. Returns are only 30 days and they do not honor the manufacturer's warranty of 1 year. I wonder if this was a refurbished flatiron because if it was they should've told the buyers!    You can buy directly from Croc here:  [...]
B00MB58AFY|3|This wig was much smaller than I thought it would be. The best way I can describe it is more of a teen size. I used it for an Elsa cosplay and while the wig itself was great for the braiding and styling, it was not a good fit and I frequently had to readjust it.
B000MOOEHY|5|This brush is great. I had one a couple years ago before the bristles get bent out of shape. What makes this brush so great is that unlike the tourmaline and ceramic brushes the metal core of this brush really heats up to help straighten thick curly hair quickly. And my hair looks great, not damaged at all, but wouldn't recommend for people with fine or medium tecture hair.  I dont understand why the aren't selling these in stores anymore.
B00GGBZLRY|4|I love it I just got it and I put it on my phone I love it
B003AYEUE0|2|Taste is great, but does not polish teeth well.
B000NCVAC2|5|My manicurist uses this  product so I decided to also use it at home.  It is wonderful.  My feet are so much softer.  I also use a Flowery Swedish Clover foot file and the combination has made a world of difference in my feet.  I use a very small amount of this lotion and it works great.  This should last a very long time.
B002JCSM3Y|2|I have this product 2 stars because I had actually liked the product but the pump broke within the first few pumps.  I had contacted the company and they won't refund me or work some kind of exchange either.  Basically they don't care.  I don't be supporting their products again.
B00JFQXDDQ|5|Yes it did
B00F008GFQ|5|I love this makeup brush!  Bristles are very soft and not as uncomfortable as I was afraid they might be with this type of makeup brush.  This brush does a great job to make my makeup look more natural and not too overdone.  I would highly recommend!
B00JF0IK12|3|works as designed but feels a little cheap...
B00EHJB5UY|5|I can't personally speak to this cream's efficacy but my mother swears by it.  She has suffered from RSL since... since long before RSL was recognized as anything more than hysteria (what one of her doctors said back in the 50's - whom she quickly showed the door) or hypochondria (what others thought but were smart enough not to express).  This is the only remedy she found that helps her (and she has tried just about every formulated Rx out there).  She turned her sister on to it (who also suffers from RSL) and ... same result.  The one thing my mother noted is more effective if it is applied every night before bed (her RSL strikes at night like with many people) and on a consistent basis (i.e. not just when she feels RSL coming on - or after it has kicked in).  She also applies it when the syndrome starts manifesting.  I have little doubt that an important component of this remedy is the application - massaging it into the legs.
B00V06OC02|5|this is an amazing product and we use it often
B0015IPA9M|4|It's great!
B00LEYZHG8|5|This stuff is amazing.  If you have an itchy sweat rash this powder will give you instant, cooling relief.  Another nice thing about the product is its mild aroma won't leave you smelling like a freshly diapered baby.  This is one of those products that really work.
B008DYJKLA|5|Fantastic lemon scent. Long lasting , delicious scent
B003UIYG40|5|Make sure when you are cheking out it is sold and shipped from henna hut and not anyone else. This is the best henna available on the planet and many are trying to copy them. This is the only henna that is ready as soon as you mix it. Even henna tattoos with in an hour. No lemon needed , just tap water.
B002Q1UD26|1|I received era &#34;everyday foundation&#34;. The item description and picture clearly shows era foundation, not the cheaper, &#34;everyday&#34; version of era foundation. This item cannot be returned because it is an aerosol. I just got gypped. Do not buy from this seller!
B000R46I1O|5|use it in the morning and at night. it is a great product! thank you as always. i'm very satisfied.
B004B389SC|5|Excellent
B000QY5TWO|1|That scissors if you want to use for to cut paper is wonderful but for a haircut is useless I like that brand and I already have one for years but this time I didn't have luck. It was a waste of money.
B0012RXBBA|5|Bought as a gift for a friend who likes 'spicy, oriental' perfumes and she loved it.
B004PFUQR8|5|Great product, it isn't too waxy, and isn't too glossy or oily, it's just right, and the mint adds an extra tingle which personally makes my lips a tinge pinker.
B008S20OLW|5|I love this Sea Salt Soap!  It makes your skin feel so wonderful and it works great as a shaving soap for your legs!
B0002CTSRM|5|LOVE this! I have worn and burned amber resin for decades and this is a very nice softer amber!
B00HB2JQNM|5|Works great. Good price. Great for skin that is sensitive to fragrances.
B00WAJBI46|5|it arrived earlier than the estimated date and the brush is so soft
B0006NH946|5|I absolutely love this product!  For an everyday household cleaner (bathroom & kitchen), I add 1/4 cup of soap to a full spray-bottle of water.  It leaves my counters and sinks clean and shiny.  I even use it to clean up spills on my wood floors.  The bottle of Dr. Bronner's soap will last me a lifetime with how little I need to use for a full bottle of cleaner.<br /><br />Using it for a household cleaner as described above, this product is truly environmentally friendly (unlike your Clorox and other like products) and it's MUCH cheaper than other store-bought green cleaners.<br /><br />Do yourself (and your wallet) a favor, and buy your favorite Dr. Bronner's soap to make your own household cleaner!
B00005JS5C|5|Easy, fool proof, and safe. Quality product. Have used this handy contraption several times since purchase and no complaints. Thanks
B00L4FNIA4|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE! Perfect for beginners to experts! I got the brush set that goes with this as well and they work so amazing together! I would definitely recommend. Don't waste your money on products that are exactly the same, but so expensive
B00A3WR5C6|4|I LOVE my home kit. Just remember, buying a home kit will not make you an instant manicurist! Give it one or two tries before you give up! OR better yet, go to a salon and watch how they prep the nail and apply the polish verrryyyy carefully so you know what to do at home.<br /><br />One thing - I have NO idea why it is so expensive online. I got mine on Target off the shelf for $65 and it wasn't even on sale.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00LVPDBA4|5|Works great. Same thing as the more expensive version I had before but this doesn't have all the modes (which I never used anyway) the only thing I miss is the quadpacer that told me when to switch sections of my mouth. Bought this one because my last one died after 2 1/2 years. Good deal for the price.
B00L2JKUY4|4|This is a bit harder to rub in than a shampoo, but if it works who cares. I am using this with the shampoo, so you can check my comments under the review for it. Lastly, I am using it at night and shampooing in the morning. I will update as I see results.
B000JC0BK8|5|My boyfriend loves this and i love how it has changed his face. His skin looks amazing. No more Nivea!
B00T1MYWOS|5|Really pretty and well made.
B000EA0L5K|5|I highly recommend this product.
B007URZFKQ|5|I use this stuff about every month and it's FANTASTIC and lasts quite a while.  Not only does it keep your eyebrows tinted for a long time but you really don't need that much so the tubes last for over 2 years!
B0047F9622|3|This set comes with 3 separate moisturizers: A day moisturizer, an eye cream, and an overnight moisturizer.<br /><br />The day moisturizer was lightweight and, frankly, a little light in the contents department. The other 2 bottles in this set have the ounces labeled, but this one does not, and I found it ran out very quickly. The inner container is white to make it look like it's full, but I suspect it may not be. Further, with absolutely every other moisturizer I have used, I use a significant amount for a few days but then can start to use less of it as my skin adapts to the moisture. Not with Youth Code! I have to use a ton of it, especially of the day moisturizer. The overall moisture level is not great, at least not for the hype and the price. With this particular bottle, I got the same moisturizing effects as the lower price popular drug store brands, but without any exfoliation to speak of. Other brands usually help slough off old skin cells, but I did not get that with Youth Code. I personally would use the day Youth Code brand as a secondary moisturizer for times when I end up washing my face in the middle of the day and need something quick and light.<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to mention that I went back to using the day moisturizer a few weeks later to give it another chance. I noticed that after about 5 minutes of applying it, I had to apply more because it just didn't slough off any dry skin or moisturize properly. A second application made my face really greasy after an hour or so, though, and I noticed a significant patchiness and uneven color to my skin. Definitely not impressed with the day moisturizer.<br /><br />The eye moisturizer didn't do a thing except sting a little and make one small section of my under-eye area puffy. The applicator was useless, but I don't mind using my fingers to apply it. As I said, once it's applied it stings a little, and there is a small oval under-eye area near the bridge of my nose that puffs up after it's applied. I have had similar puffiness with other brands so this was not surprising, and the good news is that it puffed my skin up less than other brands and the puffiness goes away after about 10 minutes. If I only use it about twice a week, I do notice some slight softening of the skin under the eyes, so it appears to moisturize as advertised. Again, though, neither wrinkles nor eye circles were affected by this product. I will still use it twice a week for softness, though.<br /><br />The nighttime cream (called the day/night cream because it can be used for both) is best used as an overnight cream put on just before bed, but I've used it both ways. The first 2 nights I used it, white chunks sloughed off my face, and I've found a few gummy bits in the tub of moisturizer. I don't believe it was exfoliation, but instead from the lip of the container where the moisturizer was exposed to air and dried a little in the cold during mailing; if you buy this in a store, you probably have nothing to worry about. I started using this one twice a day after the day moisturizer just didn't do anything for me. This day/night moisturizer is thicker but, again, I had to use quite a bit of it. While it seemed to work at first, within an hour my face would be dry again. I would put this on and then about half an hour later go to put makeup on and need more because of some dry patches on the skin. The scent of all these products is pleasant and relatively mild, although the tub of day/night moisturizer smells a little like glue.<br /><br />UPDATE: When my second try at the day moisturizer didn't pan out, I started using the day/night cream once a day in the morning. It actually worked really well, with significant moisturizing that lasted several hours. I only used it once a day which still gave significant benefit. The scent, though, is really unfortunate. It is just like glue, and I don't think I could use this all the time because of the scent.<br /><br />I was so sure that I just hadn't given this enough time, which is why I went back and tried the day/night and day moisturizers again, but after all that, I pretty much give up. I am going back to my usual department store brand, which of course I can't name, but to compare price note that a tub of it the same size as the day/night Youth Code is just under $20 and performs exponentially better. There was no difference in wrinkles, age spots, or anything else that would make my skin look &#34;younger.&#34; For the price, you're not getting anything with Youth Code that you can't get with a lower cost general moisturizer at your favorite drug store.
B003FSGRW4|4|I've always had trouble with acne, and have tried numerous products and medications throughout my teenage years. Now I'm in my 20's and my skin has calmed down a bit, but I still have occasional problem areas. I had a lot of scars left over so I thought I would try this product, and I've found that it does work but requires patience. I didn't see a positive result with my scars until I had been using the product for about 4 months. However it really helped keep pimples away. From everything I've tried on my skin, I'm now finding that products with antioxidants like this one, are really good for the skin. A warning though. When you first start using this product you will notice an increase in breakouts. This is because the antioxidants are pushing all the toxins to the surface. Don't stop using it though. Most likely the breakouts will stop and you will have clear skin like I now have. I also found this to be good for oily skin. In the morning I wash my face, put this on and let it dry a bit, then put my makeup right after, forgoing moisturizer. And by the end of the day I don't have problems with shiny skin.
B004HEEANS|5|Love it!
B00J5N0Y4U|5|Own spots are fading.
B007GGD7S8|5|I wish they still sold this in a larger tube but I was very glad to find it on Amazon. It works great on all of the fine lines that are now appearing (I'm in my mid-forties). I'll keep buying it as long as it's available.
B00DNGVPZW|1|So happy I just bought trial sized. This did nothing for my lashes. It also clumped with each layer. Melted easily. Do much better with Cover Girl bombshell. For much less.
B00O8ODHOA|5|very good for use
B00TSTZQEY|5|smells good
B005A96JBK|3|Frankly, I don't think they're as good as the Gillette yellow box blades that cost less.  At least with my beard they don't &#34;cut the mustard&#34;.
B006SMMYTE|4|I don't really see much of a difference in the whitening, but it is great for my teenage daughter who has acne.
B00910ZHTY|4|It is very thick. not easy to spread if you are not a professional. Be careful when opening the product the protective seal is not easy to remove. the colours are beautiful.
B0050QJ0YQ|3|My sister tried this out for me.  She has hair down to her shoulders, but thinks that it would work better if her hair was longer.  She was able to wrap a bit of her hair around it, but I guess the effect would be more pronounced had she longer hair.  Other than that, it seems to work well, and heated quickly.  She burned her hands a few times though that's her fault and not a flaw of the iron.  It took a bit of time too, so she thinks it would be better as a once in awhile thing, and not an everyday tool.
B00157S30Q|2|I guess I cannot rate this product completely accurately, as I did not use more than 3 times. I used one pad every other night, and after the 2nd time, my skin started getting 3 huge cysts, one on each cheek and one on my chin. After the third time, the cysts got bigger. I decided it best to discontinue. This was weeks ago, and the cysts started to slowly subside after discontinuing usage. I don't know if this is a common side effect or the product is doing its job, but I think it was mostly due to the lack of oils left in my skin after treatments, so my glands started working overtime. Not for me, but may be good for anyone who has not had any issues with acne in the past??
B00CJH4D9Q|5|I love hair
B003GE49A4|3|People raved about this but it's not one-stop makeup remover. I like Shu Uemura Cleansing oil way better. I gave Bioderma a try because I thought I could save money from buying Shu but I was wrong. I had to use 3 rounds of cotton square to remove the makeup on my face and the mascara did not come off easily. I ended up using more product than when I used Shu Oil. I'm going back to Shu after this. 500ML lasts me a year+ but this one probably won't last 3 months.
B004Z1LD8S|5|Did the job well
B000TZG8WK|1|TARTE Emphasis Eyes inner rim eyeliner was a complete waste of money. How does it stand up on your eyes? I wouldn't know. It is WAY too soft﻿ and breaks off the plastic applicator every time I try to apply it. I even tried to put it in the refrigerator but alas, no use. It is a poorly made product, way to soft to stand up to any pressure. Wont﻿ by TARTE products again and shame on Ulta for recommending it!
B000C2149W|5|All good!
B003WN1ELQ|5|Works great on my face, plus supplies protection from the sun.
B004OE2ZS8|2|i love the idea and desing but hard to put on, i felt like i needed a couple more hands to get it on so it looked as good as it could have
B007WTSCCK|5|We are a Dermatology practice and use this product after certain procedures to calm and soothe the skin.  We have used this product for many years, with great satisfaction
B005FPN0MU|5|I am 35, have red hair, and fair skin. My skin breaks out very easily, is oily in the t-zone and I have minor rosacea. I use this powder everyday as a general redness minimizer and to reduce oil. I don't usually use anything below or on top of it. I'm pleased with the quality and it makes my skin look natural. It doesn't make me break out. I like the fact that each purchase comes with a new brush, so that bacteria doesn't build up on the brush over time. I have been using this product for over a year. Recommended.
B004XFY8QU|5|Love it great smells amazing
B00MXMMW8G|5|Very happy with the purchase 👍
B00639DLV2|5|This is great suntan lotion. It smells really good, and goes on like an expensive, non-greasy hand cream.<br /><br />The only downside is that the bottle is pretty small, which means this is pretty expensive per ounce.  You may want to use this just for faces and cover larger areas with a cheaper kind.  At SPF 30, it would work well for that.<br /><br />Expensive, but recommended.<br />Sean P. Logue, 2012
B001V9SXXU|5|Both of my children suffered with terrible eczema.  This is the only cream that keeps their skin soft and bump free.  I even use it on their face.
B004V9QP0A|5|I love this product. I use it daily and feel my skin is truly softer and brighter. I got a friend to start using it as well after one use of mine. You really just need a little dollop to do the job as well so it lasts quite a long time.
B0018A32XS|4|Might be the perfect bush mower.
B0073VBT2C|5|I never realized how wonderful this iron would be and how great my hair would look by doing my hair at home and not spending money at the salon. I feel like this iron pays for itself in that way.<br /><br />So a little bit about my hair, I have natural kinky hair that is coarse and dry. Normally when I flat iron with my 20-30 dollar flat iron my hair still feels puffy and has no movement. I just thought since I'm natural that must be the reason. After using this iron my hair had so much movement I was amazed. I only passed it through each section of hair once and I already had MOVEMENT! I let me hair breath a bit and did a second round with this iron and my hair was shiny, bouncy, no frizz just softness. It was Just amazing probably even better than if I had went into a Salon. My hair style lasted three weeks and was still smooth and bouncy. (compared to my other flat iron which would be about a week if even) I believe it lasted this long because I also did this during the winter months so I barely sweat.<br /><br />My only caution to you is that you keep the heat setting a bit low not at the last setting of 450 degrees. Since my hair was coarse I thought my hair could take it but even i had damage, (but for more reasons than one).  Also make sure to use heat protectant before using this flat iron. Another thing is you most likely only need to pass this ONCE on a  SMALL section of hair. depending the thickness of your hair will determine how slow you should go as well with this iron. Last tip to keep up the hair style put some sort of oil at the tips of your finger tips and finger comb your hair. (I used coconut oil) It helps maintain shine and health for a longer lasting style.<br /><br />All in all I love this flat Iron and I'm so happy I bought it!!!! And now that I know how to take care of my hair before and after I can not wait to use this again.
B00S9TDWBS|2|I would not recommend this product if you color your hair.  I bought this product for the natural ingredients and to help with an irritated scalp - had seen in other reviews that it was color safe.  It made my hair look great the first couple of uses and my scalp felt less irritated, but then my hair started looking really dull, greasy, and it very evidently had faded my recent hair color (where with other products my hair color would last a very long time).  I still use this once in a while to help with my scalp irritation, but cannot use it on a regular basis.  Not worth the price.
B00GDV55B4|5|This is a great product.  It is actually packaged in a dark bottle to protect it from light exposure, and you can tell when you apply that it is a quality serum.  It is smooth and even carries a gentle scent.  Plus, it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin!
B000NCTROK|5|To keep my hair hydrated I use Alto Bella Leave in Conditioner.  Just a little squeeze, a bit smaller than a dime, does the trick for my hair.  My hair length is just below the ear.  It keeps it soft and manageable.  Don't use any more than what I told you or else your hair will feel greasy.
B0039VOSPU|5|Great product, pricing, and quick delivery time. The seller was on top of it!
B00I8H6FUG|4|Rather than continue to me a masochist, I bought this for the scissors, to replace a decade-old pair I've used until it stopped cutting and instead started plucking out nose hairs. I figured a couple bucks more for the kit rather than just the scissors was justifiable. The tools themselves are great. Excellent quality, sturdy, sharp and useful. The case is the only drawback. I was excited about the prospect of having a good case to hold them in when put in with my toiletries, but found this case to be a strap of leather with holes on either side. So the tools, which don't have good-fitting places to sit within it, slip out the sides and eventually can puncture the toiletries bag. So, all but the case is excellent. The case, a failure.
B002SJ4ADO|5|Very difficult to find in retail outlets in the United States and impossible to get in Jordan.  Makes electric shaving so easy and without the mess of a liquid.  Highly recommend.
B000QYEK88|3|My beard grows in really awkward directions on my neck, so I've never really gotten the kind of close shave other guys are talking about. I *have* taken off large amounts of skin from using shaving techniques picked up with cartridge razors. I *have* got lots of missed areas because I just didn't want to deal with the pain and sting of razor burns. I *have* unloaded a lot of money into making this work; it's probably just not going to work for me.<br /><br />Aside from the learning curve involved in changing the way I shave, I just had some surgery which will leave a fairly large raised scar on my neck. Since I'm having trouble without that impediment, I'm just going to chalk this up to a bad purchase and go back to the more forgiving cartridge shave.<br /><br />This is a beautiful razor, and with shaving oil, it's capable of more than I'm doing with it. I just have to accept that it's not for me.
B00I5H5Z1O|4|Definitely thought it looked a little silly when I opened the box.  I got this product from Influenster for free to use for testing purposes.  It packs the same punch as the full size razors but has the added functionality of being super portable.  Easily fits inside your purse, gym bag, or beach bag.  Also great for traveling.  And if you already own sever blade replacements, the venus line will fit on this little handle too!
B007M46L5U|5|This indigo powder mixed with henna gave me the brown hair I was looking for. I only bought the indigo from these guys, as I purchase my henna locally from an Indian grocery. But I needed both to make my &#34;henndigo&#34; blend. The quality seems great, price was competitive, and the delivery was when they promised (not prime fast, but fast enough). I ordered another pack of three to have on hand so I won't have to wait. I'm quite pleased and intend to use them as my main source.
B004Y9L6GA|5|Works great!
B000217M26|5|I Have Been Using This Product For 15 Years Its The Best In Fragrance And Lasting Power And<br />I Get Complements
B003UEH6UK|5|More like a scrunch spray than a hairspray.  Gives lovely soft waves on my hair, which comb out nicely.  I love the smell; very natural, so much so I cannot wear this in summer or bees buzz around my head.  I also use it to spray my hairbrush and get rid of frizzies for a straighter sleek look.  I have used this for over three years and have only gone through three bottles.  Lasts a long time.  I love the idea it is nontoxic and have no skin or scalp reaction whatsoever. Aubrey is the best!
B000L596FE|3|My daughter has been begging me to get the &#34;As Seen on TV&#34; detangling brush. So my first instinct is to go to my Amazon app and see how much they have it for and read some reviews. This came across my search and from reading other reviews it made me think this might work instead. Hmmmmmmm...... When my daughter opened the box she looked at me and asked why I got her a brush. LOL! It was my fault I didn't look closer while I was researching this product, I didn't realize this is just a regular brush like other brushes in our house. We did however put it thru some testing.<br /><br />Background:<br />I have 2 daughters 10 & 8 yrs. old. My 10 yrs. old have Type 3C - Curly Coily hair, my 8 yrs. old have 3A-3B - Curly Spiraly hair and myself have straight hair; all pass shoulder length (Yes, my hubby is one lucky guy! He gets to unclog the tub once a week. LOL).<br /><br />Product testing:<br />The Wet Brush Vs. $1 Dollar Tree Paddle Brush<br />The Wet Brush Vs. $4 Detangling Brush from Walmart (Goody Brand)<br />To my hair no difference from my $1 Dollar Tree and Goody brush. To my 8 yrs. old Curly spiral daughter no difference. Still the same &#34;ouch!&#34; scream and whine. To my 10 yrs. old Curly coiled hair at first I didn't hear complaints, which is good. But it took me a minute to realize the brush bristles are bendable thin like so the effect was nearly a trick. The brush only brushes the top part of her hair and the bottom close to her scalp wasn't being touched at all that is why no scream. In this case I had to take a comb to part the hair to half and by doing that it was time consuming and yes - can you imagine trying to part the 'rat nest' like in half? My daughter started whining and there goes the &#34;ouch!&#34;. Needles to say compare to my $1 Dollar Tree brush and good ol' Goody brush it's still the same result. With Dollar Tree and Goody I only had to part my kids hair 4 ways, with this brush about 6 ways. 3 Stars since it's not a bad brush but not a GREAT brush!
B00JPW7RSW|5|I have been using these towels in my salon for about six weeks now. We do a lot of color and they get washed at least once everyday with hot water and are still true to color. I bought similar towels from my local sales rep and they weren't as soft so I purchased these a second time from amazon. You won't be disappointed.
B000052YBV|1|I  could not believe how VERY expensive it has gotten.  Not long ago AT ALL, I could buy it at C.V.S. drugstores for about $7.00 or $8.00. And now you want 98.00. That makes no sense. I will never  buy it again and I really liked using it<br />. Sorry cushion grip you have lost another customer. P. Boone
B00AVYJM18|5|This is the only roll on I can use for my sensitive skin. Everything else gives me rashes. I love this one. Doesn't have a strong fragrance but it keeps the odor out!
B000C1UETE|5|good
B002VA4LNO|2|i previously read that  item will cause more breakouts but i still took a chance. guess what it caused more breakouts, nearly immediately upon use.
B000T9BMBS|2|I really wanted to love this product, but I'm actually giving up on it after a week. I have fine, very curly hair, which frizzes easily. This serum made my hair feel heavy and greasy, and it seemed hard to wash out. I can imagine it *might* be good for coarse hair, or anyone who blow-dries, but it was not the right fit for me and I will be passing it on to a fellow curly-top asap.
B0048IGBD0|1|I have been using this product for about 2 months. I was not expecting some kind of miracle but a little improvement.  I have seen no results whatsoever.  I have been following the directions.  I have been using it twice a day, every day.  I would recommend going to the dentist and not using this product.
B0026CFXAM|5|Since i can't afford the $199 bottle, this was the next best thing. It's just what I wanted... Max Factor and the color I was looking for and the price was right ...and the item was delivered sooner than I expected in perfect condition.
B001XURHES|4|I didnt even get a chance to use this bowl before I dropped it and broke into little pieces. I still think this is a great bowl compared to the buffalo horn shave bowl that I currently have. Will save to buy this product again.
B00MJ9QEK0|1|terrible.  Ill fitting on my Muhle handle.  Shaves rough and holds blade incorrectly.  Does not come in manufacturer packaging so cannot verify if it is an actual Muhle product.
B00H40NFCE|3|All though its pretty fancy looking it has an awful smell. I don't know how to get rid of it EXACTLY, but I washed itout with soup and sprayed it but the smell is still there. : 
B00TXBC9T2|1|Very drying
B008YQ0R9G|5|As I have very sensitive skin I found the Aria Cleansing Kit very gentle and I love the results. It also exfoliates leaving the skin rejuvenated. I would definitely recommend the kit and have also bought one for my adult daughter.
B006OZF398|5|This primer is awesome! My makeup goes over it perfectly and I love that my complexion looks amazing all day. I don't use a lot - I feel like a little goes a long way. Issues with flaking/peeling probably happen when you use a lot of the product, but personally, I don't feel like I need it. I also love that it's subscribe and save- never have to worry about running out!
B008PDZYZK|5|Best shaver ever! You cannot get a closer shave than with this Panasonic. In top of that, it's very quiet. I am saving half the time compared to before with the former generation of Panasonic (Arc IV).
B009GETWPU|2|I purchased this in high hopes, well i was mistaken. Two boxes didn't cover my hair and i have hair just past my shoulders. The color turned my roots red, my bangs almost black and throughout my hair its caramel colored and light brown. I have no idea what happened with this color, it has horrible coverage, a nasty smell. ( mind youve ive been coloring my hair for over 7 years) Also it dried my hair out to the extreme. I will only purchase this to fix the odd discoloration in hopes of a better coverage. But i wouldn't recommend buying this. Its a waste of time and money
B000EBFJXS|5|Great U.S. made product.  I've had it for 4 years now and it still works great!
B005UKZAJG|5|My younger sisters birthday was a few weeks back and she LOVED this item. It comes with so much variety! I'll never tell her how much I paid for it though (mainly because she won't believe me)
B002AS0Z7S|5|This product works as quickly and effectively. My skin was softer and smoother and more evenly colored in about a week. Love this vitamin!
B00ED2SELI|5|Design Essentials neutralizing conditioning shampoo smells awesome and does an excellent job of rinsing chemical residue from your hair. I will continue to use.
B003LZZZXS|5|Love this product, but I can't understand why the price almost tripled in 6 months.  I can't afford to buy it any more!
B000KOM08Q|1|I Received Wrong and cheaper product. NOT  the type I ordered . Very disappointed about the service.
B009TB5VRI|5|The &#34;Shelby&#34; classic stool works great for my craft room.  The wheels glide smoothly and the hydraulic functions well.  Great product and good price.
B00EDZ1SJ0|3|The product arrived fast, but I'm a little concerned that it's old stuff. The boxes are all aged yellow brownish instead of white like normal. One box had a leaky spot on it although the product appeared sealed. I cannot find this product anywhere else, so will use it and see what happens. Keeping my fingers crossed my hair doesn't fall out or something.
B009PFVUFA|5|Yeah, it has &#34;that&#34; smell when you get it. it's called new vinyl. But, the brushes are fantastic, more then i can shake my makeup at, and the smell on the case goes away with use. I'd buy it again.
B000AERIV0|5|I use to wear this in the 70's but later could not find it, Amazon had it when I was shopping for something else and I was very happy<br />to find it again, good now as it was back then.
B00576OC1U|5|I LOVE L'OREAL Mythic Oil.  It leaves my hair smooth, silky and frizz free. I tried it at a Salon and found it significantly less through Amazon!  My hair smells and feels terrific!  Highly recommend to all!
B0062IWQVU|5|I have had my 3-in-1 for over three years now, and it still runs strong. I've use it countless times, and I've never had any problems. I shave in the shower, and the waterproofing is flawless. Also works great for non-facial regions.
B004BTRXYM|1|I just have very fine wrinkles, but would like to give it a shot with this product. When it arrived, the package looks so cheap and no manual in it either. You don't know how to use the product. I just tried to press the only button on it, and it seems to have three levels. Sometimes it has weird beeps. I don't know what it means. Anyway, no use at all! Waste of money!
B00PHVXIM4|5|love this oil!!!! i would buy this over and over the only con i have is that its cold here and by time i get it its frozen, but i just set them on the counter and let them warm up to room temp. just scary touching a frozen glass bottle.
B00KAC7QHS|5|I finally made the switch to RAW rolling papers and I'd never switch to anything else. These papers burn evenly and slowly, they look great, taste great, and roll very nicely. With hundreds of papers and wraps to choose from it's hard to make your mind up sometimes but these have become my go-to.
B000EA0L5K|4|My wife tried this and swears it's more effective than other expensive creams she's bought.  She uses it especially at night before bed.
B009N3VBX0|3|Picture is a bit misleading I thaout I was getting several of these like the pictre shows. Was going to share with our friends for an event. The order is for just 1 stand with only 3 fethers. Somewhat disapointed.
B0012JG00M|5|Works as it should.
B00061SKPU|5|The days of fingernail impressions and bruises on your face are over.I wish I had owned one of these when I was a teenager. This tool works on blackheads, whiteheads, and pimples large and small.
B00G2TQNZ4|5|wow...I love this serum.  I train horses, cowboy & outside a lot. I have had cancer places on my hands, spots on the side of my face. So, here again I always look at the star rating before I buy. This one seem rated enough, price was good, so decided to give it a try. OMG...I was totally surprised. This serum is awesome. My skin is smoothing out, my hands have almost cleared up {been nearly 3 weeks now}, and it just feels so soft. I have tried a lot of prod...you know, all the miracle workers, but this does what it sais it will do...it certainly has for me. Went ahead & got my 2nd bottle, don't want to run out of this for sure. Even got an email asking if I received this on time & everything was OK...yes it is! thanks for a great product that doesn't break the bank.
B00NN6QQW4|5|Even though I read the reviews and the comments were excellent, I thought it was too good to be true.  I bought this as an experiment, I plucked my eyebrows and part of my left eyebrow had no hair in it.  I can now see tiny hairs pushing through.  I am glad I decided to buy this product.
B009NNFB0O|5|A mild, earthy smell. It goes in easily and doesn't leave any residue on your hands and it does a good job of softening the beard.
B002ZTT9II|2|This primer applies on smoothly. The only downside for me was that this primer did not effectively prime my eyes before applying eyeshadow because the makeup did not stay on and it creased.
B0010XUU9M|3|I tried these and found them to work well at removing makeup but they left my skin feeling a bit 'slimy' for lack of a better work.  I just think there may be too much moisturizing in the product for me.  I let my son use them as he doesn't like to take the time to wash his face properly and he really likes them, so it's probably me.  I tried Neutrogena's Deep Clean Oil Free cleansing wipes and liked them much better for my acne prone skin.
B00157DO4Q|5|I find it really good because Im natural and makes my hair more curly and soft also leaves it hydrated I recommend it
B000I6F4G6|4|I'm glad that I found a mascara that doesn't have beeswax (I'm allergic) and contains more natural ingredients.  It does the job for me but some people who expect a mascara to give their lashes a lot of volume might not like it.
B00A9DP9JU|5|This smell  good all day
B006RFZ81S|5|This product is great it works very very well for me. It leave skin feeling clean but not dry love it!!
B00KRBLD1C|5|Peppermint oil was shipped very fast, and was packaged very well. This works great as head ache relief, which is what I use it for. It's very strong and the aroma last about an hour, maybe longer if you put more than a few drops on your forehead. The bottle and dropper are of good quality, and you get a lot of peppermint oil, it should last quite a while! Over all I'm very pleased with this product.
B004YN9CT4|3|I think this product could work well for my roscaea.  However, I used it exactly 5 times and the fuse blew.  There was no instructions in the box that told me how to find replacement parts.  After 2 weeks of hunting my husband finally found some.  also the box and the pamphlets that came with it are in a foreign language so that wasn't helpful for trying to contact the company.
B000JZ080S|5|This refining masque is the best i have ever bought. Can't live w/ out it, honestly! I have really oily skin and this products makes my skin feel very clean.
B001MA7QLI|5|i like it very much
B000F4EMP0|3|I haven't really seen any difference yet. Been use for about 1 month.
B001FSLA00|2|Smell doesn't last long..disappointed
B000Q34X8Q|5|Love that Amazon have this! My husband favorite perfume and not found in big stores! Love, love  the smell!
B001ET7DJW|5|That's pretty much it: this face scrub does a great job and never dries out your skin. You can use it as just a scrub or as a mask. Great products. And organic to boot.
B00NJ6AYLC|4|Perfect
B000GHVKEW|1|I felt kind of disappointed.  The real Curve Soul Vintage smells gloriously clean and fresh.  This one does not, not anything like the Vintage.  So, if you want Vintage, get the one in the purple box!  And get the bigger size, 3.4 oz, well worth the money.
B000TTLD6M|5|I first bought this lotion from another site that had it on sale a few years ago for $6.95.  I have sensitive skin, and the fact that is was mostly organic and cheap, I bought it.  It is the BEST lotion I have EVER used.  I've tried many types, looking for something that would moisturize yet not give me hives.  I used this lotion on my face over the weekend, and my mother commented on my skin the moment she saw me.  We went to a movie and told me my skin was glowing like the 16 year old actress in Harry Potter.  I'm 31.  She asked to touch my face and asked me what I was using, thinking it was some expensive anti-aging something-or-other.  The web site I used to buy it from for less than $10 no longer sells it, but I am SOOOO happy to find it here.  Its worth the money.  I'm buying some for me and my mother.  I like to use it before I go to bed.  The scent is so soothing.  It absorbs quickly, is not greasy and leaves my skin soft and supple.  Absolutely amazing.  You won't regret this splurge.
B003NY01SG|5|these are fun, and easy to use, I'm not too coordinated, but it's a fun way to get firm arms.
B002DMK0I0|5|I have used Burt's Bees products for more than 10 years, but these lip shimmers are the best! I love this new rhubarb color.
B00NUEZKQW|5|Too faced has done it again. It looks like lipstick, with the convinience of a lip gloss.
B007V5DMIY|1|I have been using the spray in the morning and the liquid in the evening. The fact that more hair has been falling out since I started using this has led me to stop. I purchased this product for preventative measures as I have thin hair. Would not recommend based on the above and was really surprised because many people have given it great reviews.
B00MW7U4FU|2|This epilator doesn't work on fine hair. As an Asian female, I had difficulty getting it to work on me. I tried it on my legs, armpits, and upper lip, and it hardly grabbed the hairs. I spent awhile trying both speeds and to change the direction I moved it across my skin, hoping to get a better angle, but every time I checked, the fine hairs were still there. I might have to try getting a face epilator that is meant for fine hair. I liked how this is affordable and small, so I was hoping it would work out for me, but I guess I'll have to keep searching.
B00TYTNUFU|1|I normally love batiste dry shampoo, but the color of this is mustard yellow. It looks really odd against my blonde hair.
B003JM4OCG|5|Exactly what she needs to make her as beautiful as Cleopatra. She is always seeking things to make her attractive and this stuff is just the ticket.
B000G666HE|5|Easy to mount. Extends easily. The magnifying helps a lot.
B000PY7FRM|1|Soon after I placed an order I realized I did not want it, after reading some negative reviews.  I could not cancel my order, Amazon mentioned you can refuse package, that did not happen, like I am going to stand by the door when the package comes.  Then you read on their return policy that flammables and hazardous material can not be returned to Amazon.com.  So, that leads me to think that where is this coming from?, who is selling it.? Also, I have amazon prime and this package did not come via amazon prime, came via standard shipping, even though when purchasing on their site they show amazon prime.  I am doubting the perfume's credibility, as the plastic was open, now properly sealed either.
B000C21064|5|Original product, it arrived early than i expected, they also keep you informed of your package along the transition.  I just had to pay customs in which i didn't know about.  but i am very happy and i am surely buying again in tuccini:)
B00L1S4D3U|5|Leaves my skin silky smooth!!  I wonder if it comes in a larger jar?
B00C44KUDC|5|I have been using Big Sexy Hair Dry Shampoo but have bought cans that do not last very long and the bottle quit spraying on the last one I used after one use and wanted to find an alternative.  I would still use BSH brand dry shampoo because it does work really well...but I find this product works just as well.  The price point per ounce is better on this Batiste Dry Shampoo and it works great...because of that I would choose to use this over any other brand I have used.  Cheaper drug store alternatives that I have used are NOT as good as this stuff.  Would highly recommend.
B004A8O1GW|5|Great product!
B004JFO01W|5|I love this product! My hair was dull and very damaged before I started using this product. After shopping for a leave in conditioner at Sally's, I came across the Silk Elements leave in conditioner. The clerk who helped me recommended this product and even said it had a great smell. She even opened it for me and when I took a sniff, I already loved it. This smell is unbelievably amazing. Most leave in conditioners only smell great for the first 30 minutes after applying it. Not this one, this product last all day and it left my hair feeling so soft and gave my hair such volume. The amazing part about is, you don't need a whole lot of it. Depending how much hair you have, the product does cover quite a bit of hair. I myself have thick long hair and I did not need to use too much of it so the bottle lasted me a long time. The price was worth it and I did get my moneys worth. The sad thing was, when I recently went to Sally's to purchase another bottle, they said they had not gotten this product back into the store and that this product might be discontinued. I was so upset and could't believe that this would be taken off the shelf for consumers when this was such a great product for my hair and I'm sure for a lot of other people's hair. I just hope that this isn't the case and I can soon purchase this amazing leave in conditioner. I don't even mind if I have to buy it online and pay shipping, it's worth it.
B003QYFVRY|2|Not what we expected from this product. It is average to below average.  The unit doesn't hold its charge for long and the brush head size is smaller than a normal brush.
B00L2REOC0|4|Love it ! Love the shades, the packaging and the quality ! It lasts long !
B00RJIS4GI|5|This is a great mask!  It was very comfortable to use. It did a good job at keeping the light out - I gained a few extra hours of precious sleep because of it! Highly recommended!
B000AA5VD6|5|I absolutely can't live without this product.  Because I do my own mani/pedis I need something that keeps my nail polish on longer and also dries quickly, along with a high gloss finish.  I've been using this product for many years and this does it ALL!!!
B004058VJ8|2|I love the nails but was very upset that the glue included was all dried up.
B00AR03HRG|5|Gift to grand daughters with long hair and don't want anyone touching hair.<br /><br />They love them&#34; because they don't pull&#34;
B00D02XL2E|4|Smells good. Felt like real man after using.
B00IA8NUQK|4|Gave daughter to use, and she likes it very much.
B001MA9MRY|5|Love this stuff
B001463QC8|5|Best product I have ever used for my nails.  Promotes growth and strengthens nails.
B008OAWF1A|1|To mush money for really smal size 😒
B0054Y3L6M|5|For Goldwell canister users, this is a life saver.  The pointy tip works best for me, because I'm used the the store bought boxed hair color sets, but the brush tip is pretty neat.
B007PV2JV0|5|It helps to keep the seal and my extensions have lasted longer.  Only need to use a small amount on your lashes.
B005H7Z38A|3|I'm no quite sure how I like this product. I did notice growth with using it, but the smell is absolutely disgusting. My husband thought it was me that was smelling bad. I just can't. I do like how it came packaged and that it helped grow my hair, but the smell is not worth it. It is also really heavy on my hair. I would use it on my scalp and my ends and my hair would feel disgusting after cowashing. If you can stand the smell then purchase this product, but if you can't then try something else like me.
B00N3PFYOQ|4|Loved them. I will definitely be ordering more.
B009NNFB0O|5|I bought this for my boyfriend this past Christmas. He has a pretty good sized beard (maybe 5 inches at the longest point), and using it every other day, he still has more than half left. He is very sensitive to constant smells like deoderant or perfume, so I was nervous to order something like this. He says the smell is pleasantly mild. The consistancy of the material really looks like the conditioner is made from all organic products, like advertised. As far as promoting new growth, we're not convinced. But the best thing about this conditioner is it really tames his long beard hairs and makes it look shaped and professional, without an oily or glossy look.
B004Z209HS|5|What's nice about this product is that it is pure argan oil with no added chemical or other ingredients. I use a dab on my hair after washing, to protect it and tame frizz. I also put a little on my skin to keep it moisturized. This product comes in a nice glass bottle with an easy to use dispenser. I love that the company supports Mother Earth in their philosophy and appreciates the natural beauty secrets of the Moroccan women.
B00DS2B6GE|1|The tops don't screw on right, plus it's not really a dropper where you can get individual droplets. More like &#34;oh, here's the whole bottle. Hope you needed it!&#34;
B0060P6FSA|2|It is nice but it very hard to put on and you end up wasting many to succeed in put one.
B00D9NV20C|5|I have horrible eczema so I have resorted to making my own ointments since everything from the store is full of chemicals and doesn't work. I got this shea butter and made a balm with it using beeswax, coconut oil and calendula. I love this Shea butter! I tried it out on its own by melting a bit in my hands and applying to my affected areas. Very soothing and moisturizing. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and is so nice and smooth. Highly recommend!
B00FS7MS0K|3|I HAVE ORDERED SEVERAL TIMES, I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT THE PRICE HAS DOUBLED SINCE I BEGAN ORDERING TWO YEARS AGO.  THAT MOSTLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IT WAS ON &#34;THE DOCTORS&#34;.  TOO BAD, WILL LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVES OR BY OVERSEAS
B000R9MNRC|5|After just a couple of days, you feel the difference.
B004V4MQ2Q|5|I received this product really quick! It is absolutely wonderful!! It has a beautiful fragrance, goes on smooth, sinks in quickly, and if you rub it in leaves no streaking. It provides a nice hint of color to build on. I will reorder this product again from this seller. A win, win situation all the way around!!!! Try it, you'll like it!!!!!
B00GGPEXOM|1|Does not read anymore, only last 5months
B002JVWV4Q|5|The only one which works for me so I buy it at Amazon to make sure I do not run out, otherwise it's a case of the &#34;billies&#34; for me.
B004W17O7A|5|When I first ordered these, they weren't actually in stock on Amazon. They were worth the wait, though, not only for the quality of the brush but also for the price. Two big, soft brushes for $14! A little side note: I find that sometimes on Amazon you can find deals like this, deals that are hidden away and haven't been purchased (or at least reviewed) by many people, but are significantly reduced in price than other products available with more reviews. I'm glad I found this one!  The brushes are big and soft, and they stand up on their own. I wouldn't use them for actual application of powder or other foundation, but I use them at the very end of my makeup application just to sweep over my entire face and blend any lines that I might have missed. For those who use a setting powder, mineral veil etc, I could see this being a good brush to apply that. It doesn't seem like it'd pick up too much product, just enough to give a light dusting.  Anyway, I love it.
B00KB0XY0C|5|Timely delivery; good price; excellent light scent with staying power, but not a problem with peoples' allergy; oil goes into skin with no excess oil residue; used it for a prayer anointing service; a little goes a long way; nice to have a small container to carry; just need to have plastic bag or paper towel pieces to wipe off bottle after use because it tends to leave residue on bottle. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others.
B0045WDQFA|5|Keeps hair silky smoothe, but spray in hands first then smoothe out so your hair doesn't look greasy
B00GDKBUDM|5|I decided to give Darksyde a try based on positive reviews by other buyers, and I have to say I am very impressed with the product. I've used it 4 times now, and there is no streaking and the color looks like real, tropical, &#34;I've been at the beach&#34; tan. Because it is a lotion, I use latex gloves to put it on, and I find that works very well to keep color from developing on the palms of my hand. This lotion is also very economical, considering the large bottle you get for the price. My thanks to the Darksyde folks for an excellent sunless tanner!
B001GIOUWY|5|Of course good stuff as I expecte
B00336EUTK|2|I just can't see that these did much good. I am old so maybe they don't work on old teeth but I would't spend my money on these again.
B0007CXYYU|5|Provides light hold, shine and tames friz while leaving your hair feeling soft and natural.  You only need a small amount so one tube lasts quite a while.<br /><br />I love this product and have been using it for years but it's no longer being made so get it while you can.  Prices are all over the place but should be in the $6 range without shipping (probably becoming more expensive as supply runs out).
B007JGULS4|5|Love the hair spray but it has become to expensive...No stores in town carry it anymore.  I bought it online for the last couple of years and now it is beyond my budget I have not used anything else in over 15 years and now I have to find something that works as well.
B00N5N5EG4|3|I think this thing will be great if I can ever figure out how to use it.
B0036Z469M|5|This is my new favorite! It's subtle and soft but really gets noticed. I have short simple nails because I'm a nurse but they look sweet, pretty, and tidy with this fresh color. It's the perfect blend of purple and pink.
B00CAJ8Q96|5|Was skeptical about this and any of these simillar.  This one was inexpensive ennough that I figured was worth a try and I read good reviews about it online.  Ive only been using it about a week but I love it.  I have used the $500 Tria wrinkle laser.  Although it is geared to I think target different needs (its not really for 'firming'), I think this litle gadet has given me more / better rersults than my $500 tria.  ITs super easy and quick to use too and doesnt hurt at all.  I use it right after putting my mositurizer on, and it glides smoothly.  I had always read to never pull 'down' on your skin.  It dfoesnt say not to ... but I only use it in an upward motion just to be safe.  I dont want to drag my skin 'down'.  ;-0  It has considerable power for the price and size.  I like that it is small so that I can use it easily on my eye area.  It is listed as waterproof but I havent used it in the shower, nor do I plan to .... I like it alot.  ;-)
B0009PL4D8|5|Love it....
B002RXW5BA|3|The colors go on just as bright as they are in the hole!  Only thing is the wholes are very small... and it doesnt stay on as bright.... definately fades over a short period of time- BUTTTTT.... its cheap with lots of colors!
B002QFGQAK|5|I love this concealer palette!! It was my first palette, and will be the only one I use!! It works amazing both Queen Latifah Cover girl and Bare Minerals!!! Definitely a must have for your makeup collection!!!
B007P4IOYI|4|good book
B00434HFHU|4|Sturdy.  Holds a lot of pens.  Would have given it five stars but the two zippered pouches on the outside are useless, unless you want to keep small change in it.  They are way too small for storing anything useful.  It would have been smarter to design it with one long pouch.
B003I7YR24|5|Plate came quick and just as I expected. Works great, a great addition to my collection of stamping plates. Main trick is to use pure acetone to clean the plate regularly, inbetween stamping.
B0086VIA20|5|Love ie
B0077LAJT2|1|Awful.  I've been wet shaving for months now and have used Merkur, Feather, and Wilkinson Sword blades.  I was interested in the Personna blades because they are affordable and they are Made in USA.  I am HUGELY disappointed after trying them.  They must not be very sharp because they were pulling like CRAZY on my whiskers.  I could only make it halfway through one shave with this blade it was so uncomfortable to use.  I swapped it out for a trusty WS and was amazed how much more comfortable those blades shave.  I shave every day and have a light beard, so there really is no excuse for these blades shaving so poorly.  Do not buy!  I am returning this 100 pack after only half of one shave.  UPDATE:  I returned these to Amazon in exchange for a 100 pack of Wilkinson Sword blades.  The WS blades cut SO much better than these.  They even work OK on a dry face!  I will point out that one advantage of these Personna blades is the tiny box they ship in.  It's about 1/10 the size of the box the Wilkinson's came in.  The DOWNSIDE to this is that you don't get the plastic boxes for disposal of your blades with Personna.  You'll have to come up with some other way of safely getting rid of the blades.  To put this whole thing in perspective, 100 blades is about a year's supply for me.  For an extra $5 a year, I was able to get a VASTLY better blade from Wilkinson Sword, which includes the plastic 5-blade packs which are convenient for travel AND safely allow you to dispose of your blades.
B00AQ9QMQG|5|, I have always used Maybelline  mascara.  Some I would buy again, but some I would not, this one I would
B004CDTCOQ|5|Easy application, light scent, great protection. I put it on my son every morning before school and it takes only a few seconds to give him some extra protection for the day! No greasy feel, which I love.
B000RO6ZE4|5|I have nice long lashes. I am blonde, and so are the ends of my lashes. I do not like obvious makeup, but I do want my lashes to be visible.<br /><br />It is surprisingly hard to find a product that simply darkens my lashes. Pretty much everything else promises to make them longer, fuller, thicker, and other variants of frankenlash. This... just makes them darker. It also doesn't seem to gob up or fuse the lashes together, and doesn't run if I jump in a pool, sweat in a workout, or get caught in the rain. So overall it's natural-looking and easy to use.
B001F33F62|5|i love it looks so real
B004YWGTC8|5|Found these in my local drugstore, they only had one left and I was curious.  My eyelids were almost non-existent due to aging.  The strips were very easy to apply, but maybe I got lucky with proper placement.  They do not show on me, again, maybe due to proper placement?  I don't even feel like I'm wearing anything on my eyes and like one reviewer said, feel like I'm more awake.  I really like this product!
B0046VIKK6|5|Love this blush. Goes on well. Definitely will recommend.
B00009RF1E|5|Works great, strong motor sharp blades. No complaints here
B0040PFLWI|5|I've colored my own hair for +15 years now, and Wella Koleston is hands down the best. I use it with the Koleston 20Vol developer. I don't even look at grocery-store haircolor anymore, this is absolutely the way to go. That being said...<br /><br />There are a few different sellers of this product on this listing page. I've bought from BeautyLuxx and BeautyEncounter. Even though I bought the same color 7/43, I received different product from these sellers. The item I received from BeautyEncounter was in the old packaging and was an inferior product. Purchase the one that doesn't have a &#34;color name&#34; like Warm Celtic Copper, that is the older version. The product I received from BeautyLuxx is the current version, current packaging, and gave far superior results.
B001S4GMV8|5|Very well made. Came quickly and does the job well. I wanted it for triming the sides of my haircuts and its works very well for this. It just the right size. Price was more then reasonable.
B003UH0528|2|I ordered about 10 brushes from sigma last year. One kept shedding so I emailed them..but long story short got no where quick.<br />They would not consider helping me but told me it would resolve on its on. It never did. Recently, one of my eye shadow brushes sigma came apart. I have emailed the company many times and again have gotten no where.<br />I also sent them pictures of the damaged brush. They have a record of my purchase.<br />Finally this weekend I emailed them and told them that I was unhappy about their customer service. I also told them that I threw the brush away and have  bought a replacement. I really do not expect to hear from them.<br />I really want people to know they are a friendly, helpful company until you have problems. There are lots of brushes that are just as good and cheaper now on amazon. Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase anything because they care and are always helpful after the sale is complete and they have your money. So sad that Sigma is not like amazon.<br />Amazon you are all doing a wonderful job.<br /><br />This is an update to my review..<br />I never heard from sigma but did receive a replacement brush in the mail today.<br />I guess they took my last email seriously. I must say that I like the brushes that I have bought from them.<br />I hope others do not have a any problems with their brushes and if they do, the customer service at sigma is helpful.
B00BKO092E|4|It smells great and it does leave my hair soft but it feels more like a body-butter than a conditioner.  It is super thick and kind of hard to spread onto my hair.  I will definitely use it but probably more on a once-a-week-deep-conditioning basis rather than for daily use.
B000LQB5YS|1|Bespoke Labs sent me an 1800 watt model.  My wife opened it and began using it the day it arrived, so I never had a chance to dispute Bespoke Labs shipping me the wrong item.  She likes it and continues using it, and I must admit it does the job quite well, but it was not what I ordered and not what I paid the premium for.  Therefore, I am giving 1 star as a judgment more about Bespoke Labs than the product I received.
B0068SUX32|5|Great product fast delivery I recommend to all.
B0042WM5RS|5|vendedor responsable y cumplio a tiempo con la entrega bien embalado y a la fecha dicha en la oferta gracias
B00132FUNG|5|it work great, its quite even if it close to u, it didnt wakeup the kids if the door was open. it even tell u when to changes sides. reasonable price too
B008YXP9I8|5|excellent product what am I going to say about a nice cream, more than buy it try it and you will love it.
B0037TM252|4|I don't know that it's helping me regrow my hair, but it's certainly slowing the loss process, and I appreciate that immensely.
B006GQYSGO|3|the razor is fine I wish they would have provided a carrying case . The other Norelco I had did.
B00181UJDI|5|Wish the set had the slid on clips and the price was lower but love the set.  its hard to find a set with smaller curlers in them like i need.
B004WAHWTQ|5|Smells wonderful. Very potent and spicy! Just a tiny amount will leave you wafting in the breeze all day. My only complaint is that the base compound is much less solid than expected. I used probably a couple of weeks worth just by scraping my fingernail across the top and rubbing it on my neck!  Wife loves it!
B003KZBI30|5|it's HOT, it's dark and it smells good. I've got 2 bottls of them and I'll recommend it to all
B000LTJRT0|5|I thought the quality was good and the price reasonable. I am sure I will order more of these in the future.
B000NL0T1G|5|Best razor I ever got, worth the investment!
B004KPYWM8|1|Too expensive
B004XJNQXW|3|This was my first purchase from Bundle Monster and from Amazon.com too.  The package arrived very quickly, just a week.  Plates have many nice full nail designs and beautiful french tips, my favorites, also these stamps better than smaller ones.  These full nail designs are larger than the other set, but still they are not large enough to cover the nail of my thumb or middle finger in only one pass.  I like them but, i would like to buy another Bundle Monster set with larger designs. Thanks.
B00BFX4NRC|5|Great oil!!! Very moisturizing.
B0010XUU9M|5|I love these cleansing towelettes! They really work and they don't dry my skin out. They just leave your face feeling clean. I've tried similar products from Burt's Bees and Mary Kay and have always come back to the Neutrogena brand. They are simply the best!
B001CT09O0|5|I bought this as wedding gift for a friend.  She loves it and thanks me everytime i talk to her.  Highly recommended
B0000691JH|5|I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical when first purchasing this product, But. Wow! It's such a great product! ;D Everything I Moomed, afterwards was baby soft! Buy this product, You won't be disappointed!
B005R1XV58|5|I love this product, I use it under my lotion in the morning before makeup. I bought a pack of 12 because I use about a tube every 2 months and I was getting tired of ordering it (and the price on the 12 pack is great). Best benzoyl peroxide out there too!
B001U28CW0|5|Amazing shear bundle price is worth it
B0012BSKBM|5|I really love this lotion. It has a really nice, cinnamon-y smell to it. I have also been using Dr. Hauschka's Rose Moisturizer but it is quite expensive. This is a very good alternative. I will keep buying it!
B0017QA4EI|5|The Desert Essence Coconut lotion leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft just as if you just completed an exfoliation.  This is a wonderful product and has a nice scent.
B0018A32XS|5|Good product.
B00BKF2QGK|5|Excellent!!!!!
B00068EXQ8|5|Nice grip handle trimmer. Battery life is also solid. Can't beat the price andvalie combo.
B0085G6OU6|5|I love this stuff don't ever stop selling it
B004D99V72|3|Delivery as expected. Works fine, but nothing above average really. I bough it because my friend had one that works wonderfully, which is not the case here.
B0032CDTHY|5|The delicate yet captivating scent of Elizabeth Arden's 'Fifth Avenue' is brought to life in a deoderant spray! When used along with Elizabeth Arden's Fifth Avenue perfume and lotion, it leaves you with the unmistakable distinctive scent of 'a beautiful Fifth Avenue woman'! I absolutely love it, and wouldn't be without it!  . . .And would you believe that this deoderant actually works? That's right - it's an anti-perserant and deoderant!
B00IZLVG0E|3|Lip tints are my kryptonite — I go weak around them. Can't help myself. The stuff is my product of choice. Every time I see one, I want to try it. Got this from Carbon Beauty — great store — and I like this a lot. I have fairly pigmented lips, so the light tint on this doesn't show much on me. It does give very subtle my-lips-but-better look. I think it's a good lip balm, very moisturizing, but I prefer a deeper, more long-lasting tint. I'm using this for a straight-up moisturizer and applying something else over it. While I like the appearance of the sliding tin, it's not my favorite way to apply lip stuff. I'd rather have a stick. I plan to try Carbon's French Girl Organics next. I suspect that might be more my speed.
B0019902VS|5|Nice foam.
B005QPKKJK|1|Heat stopped working after only a few weeks. it is quieter than most blow dryers.
B00ESY8XTO|1|It's only one .... very disappointed
B000X2FUXC|1|This electric razor was good at first when using it. It was excellent for military hair cuts ... until the motor burned out after 3 months of owning it.
B005ELMXP0|5|hello my name is nanetta and I really love this soap do u have any more it is the only soap that works for my skin my email address is nmanigualt@epbfi.com  thanks
B00130193I|1|NOT Eucerin PLUS Intensive Repair which is the only lotion recommended to me by my doctor. Just the regular Eucerin Intensive Repair. Very dissatisfied as I thought I had finally found it on Amazon after many brick and mortar stores had told me they no longer stocked the PLUS variety of the lotion. Also, it is not a very good price for being the regular Eucerin lotion.
B00007M9SU|5|First of all, let me say that I got this shaver because I was tired of spending a lot of time shaving with a blade. Not only time, but also money (those blades and the shaving gel cost quite a bit, and the cost adds up overtime.) My skin was also getting irritated from shaving every morning with a razor. I decided to give this shaver a try, and have been using it for about 3 months now. Here are my impressions:    The shave that you get with this machine is no worse than the result that you get with other electric shavers. It will never be as close as the shave that you can get with a razor, but it is close enough to be perfectly acceptable. As a matter of fact, this is the closest shave I have gotten from an electric razor (and I have owned 2 previous Braun shavers within the last 15 years, both of them the expensive models with rechargeable batteries.) That's not the only advantage this shaver has over other electric shavers though:    This shaver uses 2 off-the-shelf AA batteries. A set of batteries lasted me for almost 2 months, which I found impressive. Since AA batteries can be found anywhere, you can use this shaver with the confidence that it will never become obsolete when its built-in battery stops being operational (which seemed to happen way too soon with the other electric shavers I owned, by the way.) So far I have used alkaline AA batteries, and at a rate of 1 set every 1 1/2 months, the cost is less than what you have to pay on blades and shaving gel. I also plan on using rechargeable batteries soon (I am not sure if this shaver works with NiMH batteries though,) which would make the cost per shave almost negligible.    Another advantage is that you can use this shaver on wet skin, and can also wash it under running water. At first I was reluctant to do that, but I eventually found out that it works quite well to clean the shaver, with no ill effects.    The only disadvantage to this shaver is that I believe the cutting block is not replaceable, butat the price this shaver is sold for, it would be ridiculous to spend money to replace a part that might cost almost as much as the complete machine.  (Edit: After an in-depth cleaning, I verified that the cutting block is indeed replaceable, or at least removable.) Also, after more than 2 months of daily use and a serious cleaning, the shaver looks now like new. I would give it 6 stars if I could.)    Yes, I like this shaver a lot. And I plan on getting a few backups.
B002CVTVVY|5|Bought this for my son.  He smokes and drinks drinks that discolor his teeth.  He is very pleased with the way his teeth look after using this toothbrush.  He has been able to get his teeth to a respectable whitened level even though he still smokes and drinks the drinks that discolor his teeth.  He has had this toothbrush for almost two years at the writing of this review and it is still working great.  He travels frequently for work and the sanitizer and travel accessories are very helpful.  He sometimes has to share a hotel room with another male employee which is why I got the model with the sanitizer.  He likes this toothbrush very much.
B002LYTTT6|5|Works great - doesn't tangle hair and metal barrel works perfectly as a curling iron.
B007LO965I|5|This reasonably priced mascara stays put for hours. It has great staying power. It also washes away pretty easily.<br /><br />It really does add great length as well as volume to lashes.<br /><br />I've been using this mascara for the past six months and have nothing but praise for it.<br /><br />A great product!
B007BKB6AU|5|It works great....
B000AUIFCA|5|These brushes are great. I just wish they were cheaper.
B0054EU4Z8|4|This is a wonderful product.  It stays on all night, the elastic is not too tight that it cuts into your head.  It is very comfortable and you do not<br />even know that you have it on.
B0041HTTA0|5|I think I've had a similar problem with many people: buying a shaver head that appears to work for Braun series 3, then finding out that it's just the cutter and will not work. This shaver head is the first one I found that is exactly what I need. It's the full head and simply attached to the shaver body and works great.<br />Some questions I had:<br />The difference between B and S is simply silver and black.<br />When I push up the side burn shaver, my shaver says &#34;use 32B&#34; and it worked great for me.<br />Highly recommend because it's a good price and works great.
B000H3I2N2|5|Hands down my FAVORITE eye liner. I am one of those girls that wears thick eyeliner every single day, so I've tested all sorts of liquid eyeliner products, some high end and some cheap. This drugstore brand is phenomenal. The brush applicator makes precise drawing easy and smooth. The color is opaque the first time. Easy to fix the shape of the black with a q-tip and washes off easily at the end of the day. Several girlfriends have asked me what I use, and now they love this too.<br />I am not a makeup pro. But this stuff makes me look like I know what I'm doing ha.
B004JTMDEE|5|Exactly as posted. Received it quickly with a handwritten thank you.
B00OZYB4JS|4|I really like the carrying case. The bottles fit in very well.
B000C1VW6I|5|This has such a clean smell - I get so many compliments wherever I go - so clean and light - just a little dab goes a long way.
B00MEDOY2G|4|I like this Dove Body Wash.  I've been having some dry skin issues, so I've been using this for the past week and do notice a difference with having smoother, moister skin.  This stuff is also pretty affordable, so it's a nice item.  The only thing I don't like so well is the aroma.  I've been using mostly Axe body wash prior to this, and they have some nice smells, the dove body wash smells somewhat medicinal.  I hope they improve that in the future, as it does kind of matter in a body wash.
B00IQMRHQY|5|Amazing quality! Very good deal-shipped from China and still amazed it got here fairly quickly and was so inexpensive!
B008RODQFM|1|Seemed great for the first two days then died. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! Save yourself the time and frustration and buy the more expensive ceramic one that will actually last.
B001VH6F9G|5|Better price than anywhere else I seen and works the same.
B0041FQHPC|5|I love the lightness and how it makes my skin feel so soft. Great product. I use it morning and night.
B004BC9T9G|1|because the advertising was false it said that is was the pro active plus micro crystals but it was not
B009U9JUK8|2|Very dry, coarse, and did not feel like the real Shea Butter. I ended up returning the product and bought it from the different company.
B00JK7XU10|4|The quality of the razor itself is decent. I wasn't expecting a world class shave at this price point. As long as you keep in mind that this is a cheap razor, I don't think you'll be disappointed. For being a cheap, Chinese-made razor, I am fairly impressed. Are there better shaving razors? Yes, but this does a pretty nice job. I give it 4 stars because the case that was included doesn't fully shut with the razor inside; so really, it kinda feels like a waste on that end.
B000C213ZM|5|Okay, call me selfish but even If I like a product I rarely exercise my free time towards writing a review. This Cologne, however, is the exception. Like many others I found this product by searching for the most popular men fragrances and although this wasn't the first on the list; it had the highest 5 star to popularity ratio. So I had to check it out. I took a gamble considering there were only 3 one star reviews and over 70 five star reviews and bought the 6.7 Ounces for $47 w/ Free Super Saver Shipping. I ordered it on March 21, 2012 and despite being told it would come in 5-8 Business Days. I received it the following day, March 22, 2012 at around 5 o clock.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with the purchase, I couldn't help but buy the 6.7 ounces given the deal and didn't want to miss out on value buying less ounces but as of right now, I am extremely satisfied. The packaging was great, sealed very well, however the smell is so strong that even the Bubble wrapper smells good. The smell when applied is not over powering and you only need 1 to 2 sprays. Hope this helps, spent over an hour looking for cologne myself.
B000CCSXFU|2|The small bottles of liquid that come with the kit are not properly sealed from the factory. Multiple bottles leaked everywhere inside the box during shipment. Thankfully the return process was quick and simple. I plan on ordering another and reporting on the performance when it arrives.
B00A0KBFX6|1|Walgreen's automatic Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor gives unreliable and inconsistant readings. Go with the Omron 7 Series Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor instead.
B000P20RPQ|5|My husband loves it. Arrived sooner than expected which I LOVE. THANK YOU!! Stays all day and the smell is excellent...
B002CP4UAC|2|Did not find the Andis, Attached ti my Andis T-edger clipper and clippers did not run, returned item. Dissapointed
B003AXJNGQ|5|I had tried a sample of this and absolutely LOVE! It's very clean yet noticable and stays on well. good price too
B00461F4PA|5|Oh ma Gah! this stuff is AMAZING! Day one, post soak, I was having my doubts.I didn't really notice any difference. Days two, three, and four, my feet just felt scaly and really dry. Then I woke up on day five and the skin was literally falling off of my feet. I am well into day 8 and my feet are still peeling. There is NO way a pedicure can replicate these results. I will be stocking up and doing this every so often as I see the need. Awesome product.
B004BCZ0TY|5|LOVE IT SO MUCH. THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PERFUME. DEFINITELY SAVED MONEY WITH THIS. LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND ILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.
B005OZOK2U|3|Doesn't hold up well in the tube, but I like the color, texture and the feel.  The elderberry is a nice soft but bright pink.
B0009XH6NC|5|This is a good product.  I got exactly what I paid for.  It arrived promptly and in very good condition.
B002HEIGKS|5|As I have gotten older, my lashes have gotten thinner.  Mascara with brushes just don't do the trick any more.  I find that this mascara with a comb delivers more product better than anything else I've tried.  I won't go back to mascara with a brush!
B00RGDZMBQ|2|wrong color too dark
B000CEQZZS|5|Sometimes I wake up and I say to myself, &#34;I wish I could be like my grandfather.&#34;  Now, mind you, my grandfather has been dead for about 30 years, so I don't want to be too much like him, but with regard to how he smelled after a good shave, well, this is the ticket.<br />Not too strong with a fairly fast &#34;half-life&#34; dissipation, I highly recommend this if you want to be like my grandfather was before he died.
B004AIXCS0|4|I like the happy frendly rubber  duckie!<br />This will be great in babies room or just a toy!  There is no squeaker! And it is a firm plastic!
B004LX7CL2|5|Took a chance purchasing for wife. She loves it and so do I. Uses it everyday. Pleasant fragrance.
B0009RWT6M|5|Some of the Lush shower gels don't really have scents that linger, like Snow Fairy, Happy Hippy, and Sonic Death Monkey, so it was a real pleasure to try this shower gel and find that its scent lingered on my skin all day!<br /><br />It smells a bit like the Body Shop's White Musk scent - kind of feminine and floral.<br /><br />It settles into layers because it has additional moisturizing ingredients, so shake it before you use it and enjoy! This product has a shelf life of 14 months.
B000EPJNMW|5|I have never used hot curlers before and so a few weeks ago a friend let me borrow her set for my birthday, just to see what they would do for my hair.  I have longer hair and a ton of it, so I just used the curlers on the top and used a regular large barrel curler for the rest.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the results.  I thought the somewhat smaller size of the curlers would give me too \\"cute-sie\\" of curls (as other reviews have complained about) but I got gorgeous, magazine-quality, voluminous curls that stayed the whole night through (and heck, they still looked good in the morning!).  I could not WAIT to get a set of my own.  I loved the compact size of the product as I will be doing a TON of traveling, and loved how quickly they got hot and, as I said before, positively loved the results.  Can't wait to get mine in the mail and start playing with them some more!!
B0026A0868|5|Nice fine mist, no dribbles. I use it for keeping acrylic paints workable. Perfect size.
B006L1DNWY|5|My daughter loves these.  It is the best deal out there.  Better than the Sephora 2 pack I bought for $10.
B001GBDQEO|5|A few drops a day as a mouthwash. I've used it for years and love it!
B0072K0SP8|3|I was generously given this razor to try free for my thoughts. It works well-the double bars gave it a gliding feel that left my skin soft and smooth. The scent was very light, almost unnoticable. I have a feeling the moisturising bars won't last long since I rinse It often to void It clogging up. It like the suction stand it came with to allow it to air dry and appreciated how easy it was to recycle the packaging. I would like them to make much longer lasting razors or ones that are completely recyclable-because If you're staying up to date on what's really going on in the world you'd be much more conscious about what you're putting on/in your body, what you're buyong, from who, and where it goes when you're done with it. Our world It's not infinite, &#34;disposable&#34; razors..I know we have the technology to get over the greed and give durable, efficient products. Stop playing with us.
B004N77JVY|4|This is not a fine piece of German engineering. On the other hand, as far as I can tell there aren't razors made today that sell for under $100 that would meet that standard. While a little ungainly, it gives really good shaves and you owe it to yourself to try it.<br /><br />The standard of construction is, I would say, about exactly what you would expect to find in something you'd characterize as worth the money on a card on a rack in a dollar store. But the shaves are great! I don't think the construction is such that you'll be handing this down to your grandchildren, but if you buy a new one every couple of years you'll have a lot of good shaves for not a lot of money. And as others have noted, if you leave it behind somewhere replacing it isn't going to dent your budget.<br /><br />I particularly like it with the Personna Lab blades, Derby blades and Feather blades (at least the last two of which are available on Amazon).
B0014WONJM|5|Is a better product than expected. Does not last long but then neither does the Fahrenheit.
B00NN07IMW|5|Excellent service and quality product.
B00HDTF9RA|5|I have skin itchiness as soon as the cold weather started.  My daughter got it worst. I tried calamine lotion, castile soap, epsom salt & others on her... but to little avail, and she end up taking benadryl.  Finally we tried this Eucerin Skin Calming Dry Skin Body Wash with Natural Omega Oil. It really did help to dissipate the itch specially when we use it in conjunction with an analgesic lotion, called Eucerin Skin Calming  Itch Relief Treatment with Cooling Menthol. Geez, the only thing is... the body wash is kinda smell like fish while you are in the shower. Thank goodness, the smell quickly goes away though.  Don't forget to follow the direction: \\"Shake well\\" before use.
B00PJY3I4C|5|I've been looking for years for an all natural product to replace my DHC deep cleansing oil. I have finally found it! This product cleans without drying, without leaving a greasy feeling, and without all those added chemicals.
B0026NUVN0|5|China glaze is amazing. It goes on smoothly and stays on for a long time. You do have to put at least 2 coats of polish on, just like any other brand to make your nails shine. The rainbow is so pretty you can combine it with any other bright color and it will the color will pop!
B00BFCV5JM|4|Works and looks great! A little on the flimsy side though.
B0011DJICG|2|Does not smell well.smells chemically  he will not buy again
B005F4EFMA|3|This product is OK, but smells strong. If a kinda/sorta heavy smell of hemp is OK for you to smell like all day, it's fine to put on the body, otherwise, it might be better to use just on your feet, on pets, shoes, etc.
B0028FEY7A|4|good deodorant, i prefer the one from desert essence but this is a great second! definetly worth a try and i love their different scents
B002Z7KSHG|5|I first smelled this in a magazine, I really liked it. The next time I hit the department store I tried it on to see how it wore. To be honest at first I wasnt sure about it but as a little time past I loved it!  The fragrance lasted well also. A friend was with me on this trip and bought it for me as a gift. I love it, and I get compliments on it all the time. I would definitely recommend trying it on first to make sure you like it.
B00G88E9DC|4|It dose the same job the more expensive bands do.<br />Good price, packaging is nice and compact so I can keep it on my counter,<br />without it looking cluttered.
B005OA8WOM|5|This straightener is far more than a normal hair straightener bought off the shelf. it make your hair straight and shiny in minutes.<br /><br />Would recommend it to any one especially with medium to long hair. It does not damage the hair at all. The only issue I had is the delayed shipping however seller was in contact and giving me updates throughout until I received it home :)<br /><br />Thanks invanity
B00COGVC1O|2|They were really really  small. Picture  looked bigger
B006GQYSGO|3|My thoughts, it's loud but seems to give an okay shave.  I wouldn't waste a lot of money on it but it seems to do the job.
B0000SW8BG|5|I had really itchy forearms.  Would wake me at night and it seemed as if I could not scratch enough.  Tries lot of other moisturizers.  This is the only one that flat solved my problem.  Put on immediately after shower.  Lasts until next day's shower.
B00DQ5NFO4|5|I love this.  I use it with all my makeup applications and it is easy to clean without water.  (Just wipe dry and there you go!)
B000FGDIAS|4|I love the texture of this shampoo - it's more creamy like a conditioner. The smell is interesting - not too medicated and a little herby. It cools my scalp and it has reduced (though not eliminated) my flakes. That being said, I would definitely purchase it again.
B004TGUKG0|5|I'm was a habitual shaver by default.  I've tried all forms of wax from home versions to professional and every form of cream.  All have left me disappointed and still with leg hair.  Now I will admit that I have some thick and dark hair on parts of my legs that can only be removed by shaving.  I hate razors because it's expensive and full of nicks, oops's and patches missed.  I thought I would give an epilator a shot since it was the only thing I haven't tried.  I'm happy I did!<br /><br />The device itself is awesome.  The size is comfortable to handle and doesn't cramp your hand when used for long periods.  There are 3 speeds: off, slow and fast.  I like the fast setting just because you get the maximum hair pulling in the shortest time.  It's a bit intense the first time you try it, but you'll quickly adjust.  It's easy to maneuver between speeds and I wouldn't modify it at all.  There is an intensely bright light above the speed settings.  It could be used as a mini flashlight if need be.  It makes it easy to see missed areas, short or baby soft hair.  Not sure what I'm going to do when it stops working.  The massage attachment is ok for beginning.  It feels ok, but it doesn't get close enough to pull out those super short hairs.  The non-massaging attachment is my best friend because it gets those barely there hairs.  Both are easy to clean with the given brush and with water.  The actual tweezing barrel can be a pain to clean with the brush so I just run it under water.  The charging/low battery lights are in a good place and are easy to interpret.  Give it plenty of time to charge the first time and charge it after each use or 40 minutes before the next use.  It's battery life isn't outstanding, but it gets the job done.  I'm not mad at it.<br /><br />Despite everything that's awesome about it, the noise it makes is deafening.  It's a very loud device and while you get used to the noise, others might not.  Be mindful on who's in the room or home when you useit.<br /><br />I'll be honest - it hurts, but not in a &#34;I'll never do it again&#34; kind of way.  It's a strange sensation.  On thick hair it hurts a lot and I ice my legs or underarms to numb the area.  It's rather fast and satisfying to see those thick hairs hit the road.  However, you'll never know how much baby hair you have until you clean the epilator.  Those little fine hairs can take time to remove (it hurts much less, too!), so plan accordingly.  If I can't do it in one day because of time, I'll do it over the course of a two days.  If I can manage to do everything in one day, it feels like I'm getting tattoos all over again.  Just irritating pain that feels like baby needles.  Sounds painful and scary, but it's really not.  It's just mind over matter.<br /><br />When you use it the first time expect general irritation and redness.  Try it before bed just to give the unhappiness time to settle down.  After that initial use, the irritation is minimal to non existent.  Invest in a good lotion, exfoliant and emergency ingrown hair remedy.  AmLactin is great for bumps and helps out on all three fronts.  I hand make my scrubs to help things along as well.  If I get an ingrown hair (it happens sometimes despite all the prevention) I use Prid salve.<br /><br />I'm not longer a slave to shaving and now it's 2 weeks before I consider my next hair removal session.  I couldn't be happier!
B009A3M6KA|5|At my last facial, this product was recommended to me because I have dry skin. I love it. It is moisturizing and has a fresh, clean scent. It is expensive though.
B003NMVMU4|5|I was so nervous about buying a wig over the internet, but I am SO glad I did. This wig is light and hair held up great. It matched my hair perfectly and I have no regrets about buying it. Youtube helped me alot for finding styles.
B0006LMDKS|5|This is one of the best products on the market.  I have been using it as my foundation for several years now.  It provides natural coverage and gives a nice glow to your face.  It illuminates skin, evens out skin tone, and is easy to apply.  It never cakes up or looks streaky, like cheaper versions often do.  I also like it because I have occasional acne and this product does not cause breakouts.  It is worth the price.
B005V2UJK8|5|This clove bud oil improved the pressure and pain of an earache I recently had. I definitely recommend it for ailments.
B001JSW42O|5|Fits my gallon jug of car shampoo perfectly, and pumps are properly measured when used right. The long neck makes it easy to pump into a bucket or foam gun without worrying about missing. My only complaint is that it does stick up rather far so I can't put my jug on the shelf without screwing the pump back down first, which can dispense a little product as you're doing it.
B00I4CHIAG|5|Usually nothing works for my acne, and while it hasn't gotten rid of everything completely, it has evened my skin tone by reducing redness and blemishes. I love this product and will continue to use it!
B004ZHTM2G|5|They are perfect just as ordered. they are for practice piercing. I'm not using these on real people.
B008FX7B9M|5|these colors are amazing
B000F371HC|5|When I use this Neutrogena night cream I can see visible results - less fine lines and wrinkles in the morning. I tested it some days using it and some days not. Now I use it every night. I look fresher and more rested in the mornings.
B00HS06AKE|4|sure makes me feel better :)
B006R7E6KA|4|Pros:<br />For $7, this eyeliner is great.<br />Perfect for beginners.<br />Matte color.<br />Very flexible felt tip.<br />Doesn't tug or pull on eyelid.<br />Takes a while to run out.<br /><br />Con:<br />When it does run out, it runs out in the most important part, the very tip of the pen.
B001E74MLG|5|Love the clean fresh smell of this deodorant. Most of the time it provides great coverage. Best semi-natural deodorant I've purchased.
B000PKNPES|5|This was a father's day gift for grandpa and it worked out very well. It is easy for caregivers to use and he can even use it himself at times.
B003ODETES|5|Love these rhinestones!! Great price, great product.  They stay in place with just top coat.  No krazy glue needed.  Just placed my second order for three more wheels.
B000NDME6C|5|The probiotics in this product make it incredibly useful to my sluggish gut. I love the taste too, very fresh and green--slightly addictive! Especially in the spring here in the northeast when my body is deficient in green stuff...Thanks!
B0084EZM20|5|This is a great product. Provides  Immediate results!
B011AGXFNQ|5|I took a chance because there were no product reviews on this yet, but the reviews on the Conair and John Frieda models were so mixed that I couldn't decide. The Revlon model really is perfect! The heat is powerful, the bristles are soft, but not too soft and they don't tangle. The spin takes a bit of getting used to, but it really works--it smooths the hair and curls the ends (my hair is of medium thickness and is naturally frizzy/wavy). The picture of the models hair on the package is not an exaggeration. I am way too clumsy and impatient for a brush and dryer, this is easy, fast and produces great results!
B002LU0H4G|5|This is anecdotal evidence, so please take it as such. But ever since I've started using this shampoo, I've noticed my dandruff has all of a sudden disappeared. And this was not just any dandruff! This was insanely huge flakes! I've literally tried everything, and nothing worked. I have extremely sensitive skin too. I seriously had thought I would have to live with my dandruff for life, but after a month of using this, my dandruff is gone.<br /><br />If you do have a tjs near you, you might try getting it there (the price is about five bucks less there). And if you have insane dandruff like I did, give it a try! What do you have to loose?
B001MA0QY2|2|The product looked promising when I first opened it, it didn't exactly work as fast as i thought it would initially, but it was alright. Then a couple days later I noticed the plates were coming loose from the attachment and I could actually somewhat lift it off from the base. That was when I decided to return it. It cost me more than I thought it would to return it, and I only got it covered up to about $5. It was disappointing. Don't know if I just happen to get a defective one, but I'd rather not go for the same brand again.
B000EOC9AQ|2|No where near as good as the now discontinued Post Shave Healer.  I've had to create my own DIY style replacement using witch hazel, Lubriderm, and coconut oil.
B00F45GIQQ|5|excellent price on time seems acceptable, very well packaged it is acceptable, I worked excellent.
B002QIADW4|5|I'm a caramel complexion and I was looking for a blush that could be worn with different make-up looks. This is it! It reminds me of nars- taj mahal, but a little softer and less expensive. I really like this blush.
B00A860FII|5|So I randomly ran into this fragance while looking around at gap in my local mall. And fell in love with the fragrance went back awhile later to find out that they no longer sold it. Jump on Amazon and always my saving grace iam proud owner of my own bottle of core:).
B003YPX8P2|5|used it all the time. i love the way it made my nails look and hands feel.
B000142TKO|1|But it didn't.<br /><br />See, I'm a [[ASIN:B0048ZIFA0 Magic Shave Shaving Powder Gold - 4.5 oz]] user.<br /><br />I had to take a business trip and didn't want TSA groping me after assuming it was cocaine or something (the powder looks a LOT like illicit drugs, unfortunately).  The canister also was not very X-ray friendly.  I was going to buy some after I arrived at the destination, but because the powder works so well, you really only need to use it like every 2-3 days or so, which would have been a waste to sit there mixing so much for so brief a trip.  So I got the cream, figuring it'd be the same.<br /><br />It wasn't.<br /><br />First, the instructions tell you to apply it thick.  But the cream is so watery that it just didn't want to apply like that at all.  Not for nothing, because even with what it did apply, I got some removal.  Nowhere near what the powder did with the same instructions.<br /><br />The real issue is that it burned the living (blank) out of my neckline just below my beard line, where the bend is when you look down.  And yes, I used a pre-shave, and no, I didn't wash my face before hand.  A red, swollen line right across.  It looked like I'd been hanged - and being African American that's not a look you want to go for.<br /><br />For some reason, I had no redness or burning anywhere on my beard area.  I'm not sure why there was this reaction, the area in question was constantly exposed to the powder version with no ill effects.  I'm thinking it was the crease itself that the cream just overreacted to, though I'm not sure why.<br /><br />So on the first hand, it didn't really work that good, and on the second it burned the living (blank) out of me.  (thanks to a post shave balm, the redness did go down after 2 days or so).
B0068U4WRI|3|This combo is ok.  I don't notice any difference between the Matrix Biolage and any other less expensive shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is fine-textured, short, and a little thinner than it used to be.<br />Smells nice; not overpowering.
B002AQF4F8|5|love it love it love it<br />it makes my lips moisturize , pinky and kind of shine . i did not feel that it make them plump but maybe it makes them more than little plumper than usual .<br />i forgot my lip stick for while :D
B00IA1GST8|5|My sister loves this product. she has gray hair.
B000YMTKFA|5|Good. Exactly what I wanted
B000VV0APS|5|Much better than different ways as soak in water for hours or chip off dry skin. Easy to apply with the foot creme of Coconut.
B0002M50Z6|5|This electric tooth brush is a terrific product.  I cannot imagine ever using anything else.
B00CC7TBHM|4|product arrived timely and will serve its intended purpose
B009U9SXEC|5|This stuff is delicious, sexy and spicy. I can't stop smelling myself when I wear it. And it lasts forever.
B008U10ASI|5|My wife loves this thing and her nails look very nice and sexy. Happy wife, happy home...
B00021E5Y4|5|My hair is fine and breaks easily, and these bands are able to grip the hair and still be gentle with it. The bands do break eventually, but only after at least a hundred uses. I buy a couple of packs of these every couple of years.<br />I've tried all three colors on my dirty-blonde hair, and I like the brown ones. The black is too dark, the clear looks weird and kind of cheap to me, but the brown blends in nicely and seems classy.<br />The clear ones are also much easier to lose. Drop them on a multi-colored carpet and they're gone forever.<br />The only thing that bothers me, which I just noticed, is that although the product weighs next to nothing, the seller doubles the shipping fee if you buy two. What's up with THAT?<br />I don't like getting gouged for shipping. Lucky for me, I have a Sephora store I can drive to. Hope you do, too. If not, it's still worth trying them out. Start with one pack and see if you fall in love like I did.
B00DZRRQMU|5|For myself I believe this was a great invention I love it.
B00G053H6I|4|Love the set.  The few plates I have tried stamp well as the other collections.  The only issue I have is plate 54 and 57 words are backwards...  the only way to use, is to stamp on another surface,back paint and peel off in the decal fashion.  Its a bit of a pain and not for beginners.  Other than that, its a very  nice set.  I would have given it a 5 star if the word plates were reversed.
B005AVMLII|5|GREAT FIVE STARS. I been using this brush since i recieved it and it works amazing. If you want waves then use this brush
B00L207BQI|5|My Daughter enjoys playing with her mannequin!!!
B0009V8N5E|5|Not greasy and looks natural not orange
B003XDVER4|1|I had gum disease during pregnancy and used this toothpaste to fix that problem. I used this toothpaste for a week and found it left the dreaded film on the inside of my buccal mucosa. I stopped using it thinking it might just be some kind of additive that leaves the film. My husband used it for a few months and got painful aphthous ulcers on his lips and buccal mucosa and noticed sheets of mucosa that he could remove after brushing. He looked on amazon for some better toothpastes and found this product and the reviews confirming his findings. This product contains surfactants such as SLS which can cause aphthous ulcerations in certain people as well as other ingredients that cause desquamation of the oral mucosa. I'd beware using this product and just ensure that you use a better toothbrush, water pik, as well as flossing to treat or prevent gum disease.
B0018MIIMQ|5|The product is light and moisturing and creates softness without weighing hair down or making it stiff or sticky. What's more I had a very gratifying experience dealing with Pharmapacks, the retailer, when the pump on the bottle would not work. After trying their suggestion (shake bottle), I informed them that it still wouldn't spray out and was told to keep the bottle and they would send out another one pronto. They apologized for my inconvenience. Kudos to them. And I can still pour the first one out out in my hand and use it that way :-)
B00ARTKAHW|5|One more practical and well done product of this brand. Small and simple to be managed and carried to everywhere.
B00764EF6I|2|It was cheap and is cheap. It does not play well with my shower caddy but it has it uses. I just put my brush in the soap cup.
B001BDVPOA|1|Parabens!!
B000QV2ORU|5|Suction Cup 10X Magnifying Mirror<br /><br />It is high quality magnifying mirror and looks good also.  The mirror is built well and the suctions cups really work well.  I won't hesitate to buy another one.
B00MMTIGW6|4|It looks beautiful; the only problem is, it doesn't go away easily. Don't use it on your own nails; use base gel with this product because if you want to wipe it off from your own nails, you will end up damaging your nails.
B0019UZFDM|5|All Pevonia Products are natural and great products to use.  I have used this line and several other lines over the years.  I love all their products and will continue to use them.
B004UE9SAU|5|Husband loves it! And
B00JAJNDZ6|5|Love them! They work very well but you have to keep taking them.  Will not see results right away.
B002T3SL7A|5|I really like this primer, it improves the look of my skin
B00N5A6VZ0|5|Wonderful set of makeup brushes for all your makeup applying .

B00DQD1WIC|5|Pricey, but I like Wen products
B002ARKAZ6|5|Different. Very cool colour
B00CJQCP9M|5|Love it, great for the summer!!
B005P0M69I|4|i love my sigma brushes and just had to add this one to my collection. very soft and applies my highlight perfect
B00383I8T6|5|I recently received the No!no! as a gift and IT REALLY WORKS!!<br />I have coarse dark hair in all the wrong places. I have been through the whole gamut of trying to solve this HAIRY issue of mine.From bleach to wax to tweezing, sugaring and many other gadgets.<br />I even tried the epilady...OUCH!!!<br />Now, I finally found something that works! The No!no! is serious hair removal. I followed the instructions and its been working great for me since I received it on Christmas.<br />I love it and reccommend it!<br />Not only is the No!no! faster, easier, and  virtually pain free, but I'm smooth for a much longer time then I had shaved or waxed (I consider that a bonus).<br /><br />Two tips I'd like to note for best reuslts...<br />1. You may need help with the underarms (to pull skin taut)<br />2. I reccommend using the 3rd or highest setting.<br /><br />**I can't beleive that there are any bad reviews about this product. I'm guessing that anyone who is saying it doesn't work is experiencing \\"operator error\\".
B00FKES0I0|5|this was so fun last Halloween!
B00A7F2ZIS|5|Yes yes yes. I'm nerding out. Lasted a day or two on my arm! Don't judge my coolness.
B00JIVKS04|5|Fast shipping and a great deal.  I love this stuff!
B0001OOEK2|5|Great to undo itches from mosquito bites, good healer, great name. I love this stuff.
B005LAPDJC|4|I am one of those users who can't sleep at all without a cpap mask...........this one does fine,...but the comfort level is still a little stiff.  No complaint...just not exactly right........don't hesitate to try this style  it works fine
B00147FGJ8|5|I'm fairly new to tanning, only having been about five times before this summer.  I tried an australian gold bronzer from the local tanning salon previouly which was $40 and only worked okay.  Read all the great reviews on amazon and decided to give this baby a try.  It smells wonderful, glides on your skin evenly, doesn't create any streaks, is super hydrating AND turns you a nice brown.  You notice a difference when you get out of the tanning bed but the bronzers sort of wash off the next morning.  I was disappointed by this until I used it a few times and saw the darkening in my tan.  It only took about three sessions for me to notice how evenly brown & tan I was getting!  So don't be dismayed if at first it seems to wash off the next day in the shower, it is working, it just takes a few sessions to get all bronzey.  And of course, you have to keep it up by applying and tanning some more, but I go pretty sparingly, perhaps three times a month and still am a nice tan instead of my usual paleness.  I noticed it is hard to keep my legs tan though!  Everywhere else it works great, maybe thats just me.  Give this a try.  For the price it's a great deal, you get a lot of product and you smell pretty good even after tanning!
B0017ZDH52|5|so glad I found this to use with my favorite Seche Vite top coat when it started to thicken! It restored my 1/2 used bottle of top coat to it's former performance when it was first opened. A definite must-have if you use Seche Vite top coat regularly.
B003S516XO|4|I bought this straightener for  my grandaughter and she loves it.Thanks Amazon
B0030ZRSHK|5|Perfect. I always use this hard wax for my Brazilian bikini waxes at home
B0009R5AO0|5|Very happy with with the product
B00MZXT790|5|OMGosh I now have FULL Pretty eye lashes! I have blonde almost invisible eyelashes and would have to apply atleast 6 coats of super black mascara for them to look OK, now one coat of mascara one coat of prolash fiber lash extender the a final coat of mascara and I am good to go! They look GREAT!
B0050X86TO|3|I ordered this set and I am very happy with them, however the other set that I ordered  I got a different set that the one I ordered.. The quality is good so I kept it I figure I try something new..  I will use this company again in the future and give them another chance.  This is why I only gave them a 3 stars.
B00912CL5K|3|This is not very heavy, great quality nor very big. It's about an inch and half long and it's not meant to really hold hair. It's more of a decoration only. Don't depend on this to hold your hair up. You would have to pin it up and add this to &#34;decorate&#34; your hair.
B001U1HI5I|5|I have had the older RoboCut for about 10 years now. Ordered one after the barber I went to used something like it.  It works great.  Then I started using it on our pets and couldn't get along without it. One pet has straight medium length hair and one has shortish curly poodle hair that you can't get a clipper with a guard through. The RoboCut provides a better looking cut than clippers anyway with some scissor touchups.  With her tight fur, it did hang and strip some small nylon gears but the company has always been more than helpful in supplying any spare parts at a small price for the internal repair I did myself. Now I see the Red unit has metal gears so that won't happen again, just be ready to unplug if it hangs. The best human and/or pet product I have ever purchased. Have saved well over a thousand dollars on human and pet haircuts over the years. I would still be ahead if I had to purchase several. I am surprised mine is still working as much as it has been used, I did also replaced the cutting blade once.  As with everything you have to use care & common since and practice when using it and follow the instructions.
B00SBSTZ22|5|These are wonderful Bathscrubs. They are soft and come in a variety of colors so the whole family can have their own. I have a large family so this 6 pack of Bathscrubs is a great value.
B003ATS2QC|5|Fast shipping. very nice packaging. Quick setup and calibration. I would absolutely reccomend this scale. sleek look and goes great with my bathroom.
B008CF34LW|5|I've been purchasing from this company for over a year now.  The soap lathers richly, rinses off clean and is very moisturizing.  Pure soap works best and rinses best when you have a water softener.  I imagine the other reviewer has hard water as this soap never leaves a waxy residue in my experience.  This is a 100% natural product, so since it has no sulfates or parabens, it truly cleans the skin without stripping the natural PH.
B001LNSMGE|3|Strong scent. Bottle much much smaller than I anticipated. Will not be ordering this again.
B009A33NSY|5|My mother loves the scent of this body lotion, absolutely perfect
B005GHP5UC|5|Good quality, odorless, high qualty oil. I really do use it every time that I wash my hair. Good stuff!
B0081BFL54|4|Great smelling perfume. Great price and have gotten compliments when wearing it. Recommend to anyone who likes to smell good!
B00H3CXED8|3|I love it
B0030HMQTS|4|This brush set has all of the essential eye brushes! I love the smudge brush because it is the perfect size for a highlight around the tear duct. I love how it is travel-size, because I can easily throw it in my bag and have it where ever I go. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because a couple of the brushes are too big for my eyes and can be a little difficult to work with. But I am smaller than the average person, so I don't think most people will have a problem! Overall - great purchase.
B0048H1OLU|2|I earnestly don't feel I saw any improvement when using this.
B007JGZGBQ|5|Another good product discontinued by the manufacturer.  Why do they always do that?  Good news is, they have repackaged it as Total Results from Matrix and you can get it again.  It's a little more expensive than the Curl Life used to be.
B004EKAF2K|5|They were really good
B001AV3YPG|5|Great for curly/wavy hair!
B002LLEVDI|1|I do not like sparkles in my eyeshadow.I am 50 plus and sparkles are not for me.
B004UEB65U|5|Great product that really works
B00SJZMYIY|5|I have been using goPure Eye cream for few days now and i like it a lot.  It smells good, feels good, not greasy but has a light texture, absorbs in few seconds. Will need to use longer to see if my smile lines diminish :).  But so far i really like it.
B004DBVPXS|1|I usually like milk and honey flavored items but this I can't stand. My grand daughter who is 7 likes it so she got them all.
B009JVYRYG|1|this brand did not stay on like other brands.  It did not have the overall stick, nor did it trim down nicly.  Then you have to put a top coat on it to boot.  It was a real pain in the butt.  We peeled them off after the first hand was done.  It was either peel them off or have them fall off on everything as the day progressed.  They are just really not user friendly, long lastings, or a good way to spend your time or money.  Horrible product.<br /><br />And yes I followed the directiosn to the t
B00SBWQY68|5|Smells amazing! And makes your skin feel so smooth!
B0018NGHJQ|5|Miracle 2 products are tops in my book.  I found out about them years ago when some gulf war vets said they were the only thing that helped them get over the mystery illnesses/rashes many came home with.  The Neutralizer gel in particular is a superior product when used as is or mixed with other magnesium based oils/products. .<br /><br />This soap is very good as a soap or spray cleaner. When other soaps fail, this will clean it. ..  In the laundry it breaks down commercial laundry soaps so they rinse out. Without this I could not use other laundry detergents.  One of the better dish or car soaps you can find since it rinses off with without a trace of film.  Its probably been 2 years since I bought a gallon, its just now running out. You really do not need much to do what it takes a half bottle of toxic cleaners to do.  Also a good spray for plants.  Well worth the price!!!
B00AE6N5U2|4|Can't wait to use them.
B001BO0KMC|5|This is just what it's advertised to be. It heats so quickly and has a wide range of heat settings. I've had a couple of curling brushes before, and this one is, by far, the best.
B000PZC5U8|5|I've been using Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker Lip Gloss by Bonne Bell for 40 years now...can't believe it!  I don't bother with lipstick at all anymore, as this gives me a light tint/color to my lips, and just the right amount of moisture and gloss.  I don't know what I would do if they ever stopped making it!  I order 10 at a time on Amazon, and at a great price.  Love this stuff!
B0007PCDUI|5|First time I tried this , simply superb and mild scent. 100% worth for your money.  No doubt will keep buying the same .
B00AQBL17E|5|Easy, fast ,good heldful
B000B8YZJI|5|This hand treatment by Robanda is wonderful. It does help to fade sun spots and works as a smoothing agent as well. I will purchase this item again.
B0073OC9S2|4|I really like these brushes, they're super cute and soft! They did stink when I first got them (very strong plastic smell) but I just washed them with baby shampoo and sprayed the bag a few times with Febreze. Once they sat out all day to dry, there was no more smell. The big powder brush might be a bit too soft, it didn't seem like it got much of my face powder on but they all still work okay, no major issues. The rest of the brushes are really great, I love this kit!
B00ICXJED6|5|good
B00MJSLAIW|5|please
B000FGXJGG|5|I had tried a small jar purchased from my Avon Representative and liked it very much.  Was very disappointed when it was dropped from the catalog.  Will continue to purchase it from Amazon if it is available.
B00SMTIUIA|5|Soft and lovely, plus affordable.
B0077PLNNE|5|There was a lot of debate in our household about this product before I decided to bite the bullet and buy it for my wife.<br /><br />After three months now, she would not be without this epilator and thinks it’s a brilliant product, but she was so very nervous (to put it mildly) before first use.<br /><br />For her first use she did the following and this helped massively:<br />-Shaved her legs a week before she wanted to epilate: for my wife this mean her hairs were the perfect length the following week, not too long and not too short for the epilator to grab!<br />-Watched the Braun video on how to epilate: this told her what angle to hold it at as well as the kind of speed she should move the epilator at<br />-Epilated whilst in the bath: the warm water not only allowed for easier hair removal but soothed her legs a little after<br />-Used shave gel: the Braun website recommended this, and it made the whole process smoother and more comfortable<br />-Moisturised her legs afterwards: this helped with the soothing process afterwards<br />-Had ibuprofen to hand if the pain was going to be too much… but it wasn’t thankfully<br /><br />My wife was especially nervous as she has never even had a leg wax before, which a friend had suggested would help. Ignoring this advice though she was fine taking all the above steps into account.<br /><br />She did experience some very mild stinging, which was helped by moisturising afterwards, and the day after epilating her legs were so smooth, she was over the moon and decided the mild discomfort was definitely worth it.<br /><br />The first epilation was the most difficult and since then she has epilated her legs weekly and after only two weeks she felt confident enough to epilate her legs dry.<br /><br />The discomfort she feels now is ‘barely noticeable’, and again she makes sure she moisturises her legs afterwards.<br /><br />Epilating is so much easier than shaving and my wife has noticed the small hairs that grow back do appear much finer, they seem to be weakening. She has yet to experience any ingrowing hairs or indeed any drawbacks to epilating.<br /><br />Apparently as she epilates more she will need to do it less frequently but each week there is the odd, very small hair and she wants rid.<br /><br />Highly recommendedck do appear much finer, they seem to be weakening.

B0043D68YW|5|Great
B002UEGTUE|5|I've used PCA for nearly 20 years, it is the best moisturizer that I have ever used.  I usually place this directly on my scalp after I shampoo because I have dry skin.  This moisturizer sinks into my scalp and feels wonderful for days.  I also place the moisturizer on my scalp before I work out, when I perspire the moisturizer seeps down my hair, and makes my hair actually look and feel better than it did before I worked out.
B00ARTK95A|5|Bought this for my 9yr old so he could keep track of how well he's brushing his teeth. I've never had a cavity in my life and I'm trying to get my son's to have the same oral hygiene that I have. I tested this out myself as I was curious how it works. I was pretty impressed! It tells you if you're using too much pressure and there's a monitor to tell you when to move from one side to the next. It gives star rating at the end and stays on there until the next time you brush, so it's nice to be ably to quickly see whenever I use his bathroom to see how he's been brushing. There are also different settings you can use. I definitely recommend this product.
B003YJAZZE|5|Bought for my husband as a gift, was his first electric shaver and he loves it. Only has to shave a few times a week and he no longer nicks and cuts himself. He says it's quiet and cleans easily
B003OSBD2O|1|This thing barely fizzes. I can't believe how worthless this is. It just kind of burps out some tiny bubbles steadily and is in no way like any other bath bomb I've used. Also, the smell is barely noticeable.  When I first unwrapped it, it had a very faint, pleasant scent, but that has long since dissipated. Oh. I should mention that this thing is still more than half intact after 4 baths.  I'm conducting an experiment to see how long it lasts just to annoy myself. I'm thinking maybe 10 baths total.  Maybe I got a dud; however, I won't be trying a second one out to see. You've been warned.
B00FOGZ564|5|My favorite blush!  So disappointed that I can't find it at Target for $1 anymore.  I bought a few here online to stockpile since I'm guessing this product will be replaced with something much pricier.  I use it as a base; rub it on and into skin, then apply a little powder blush over.  It lasts all day.  Perfect light blush so I don't look overdone.  (I still remember my dentist's assistant in San Francisco who applied a perfect red circle to each cheek apple every day.  She looked like a clown, but I guess no one said anything because I'd see her out and about over a long period of time. Trying to avoid that look!)
B00HAPWZ4C|5|This product is simply amazing,I tell everyone I know about this product!!! It leave my hair bouncy, shiny, makes the color of my hair look rich also it is it smells really good and  doesn't feel oily. I've also moisturized my face with this oil after my nightly cleansing. it moisturizes without feeling greasy.I have never experienced hair and skin product like essence of Argan. and it's all natural !! I'm a big fan of Argan product.
B000O2VD5A|5|This is a great product, but it does take time to deliver results.  I had one eyebrow significant thinner and less arched than the other, and had just started going to a persian threading expert to get them to look thicker, more even and better shaped.  The first thing she said is i need to get the other brow thicker, because there is only thata much shaping she could do otherwise - and i did not want the brow that was thicker to match the other one.  So i bought this product - not on Amazon but from a local Walgreens.  Been using it 2 to 3 times a day for almost 2-3 months now, and there has been a significant difference.  The thinner brow now looks significantly thicker, almost the same as the other one.  But i wasn't looking for results every day or week, since I had no idea if it was going to work - it does, but takes time.
B00MYXSRAQ|5|Ohhhhhh I love it!
B003XU8ABA|5|its a pleasure working with my own clippers i love them
B006QO4BRM|1|This is the worst uv lamp ever works the first time I get it the second time my gel foundation on my nails guest what the uv lamp doesnt works for the second time . I will not recommend it to anyone sorry. i give 0 star.
B0063KQB04|5|I really like the under eye depuffing serum from Clinique.  Have only bought trial size tubes so far, but probably next time with just spring for the full sized container.  I can see an immediate difference with my under eye bags from lack of sleep.  Of course, it might be better if I just got more sleep, but that isn't always possible. Anyway, this product has quite a dramatic effect on dark circles and the like.
B009YHV1KS|5|This is oil based so it last a while. My wife and I love the smell. This will be my second best scent.
B0016C0SYO|1|This set is terrible.the clippers keep turning on and off. Not consistent. The cord for the clippers is way too short. & the trimmers arent sharp enough
B0006LNLXQ|5|I love the color. It gives that fresh pink blush. A little goes a long long way so one lasts for almost a year.
B003IQEE2S|2|I sure wish that the manufacturers of this sort of item would THINK about how the consumer is going to USE the item when they make them.<br /><br />The handle on this scrubber is made from that junk plastic that is going to snap off the moment one applies even just a little bit of pressure :( The puffs are great and full, but this scrubber, IMHO, won't be able to really be used to scrub with because if you do try, you're going to end up with the handle snapped off in your hand and the scrubber on the floor of the tub....Why do they still use this cheap plastic for such purposes?<br /><br />ETA: I was correct. I don't think it even lasted a month...And I was using is very carefully, too. Disappointed! Hopefully the manufacturers stop using a brittle plastic for these things! Why not use something like comes on a toilet brush for instance? Or wood? Even if it's more expensive, it would be worth it to have something that lasted longer!
B0000535TD|5|This is great. I use it in the winter when my skin really dries out.  I rub it into my hands and fingers, and then lightly over my face, especially if I will be around the wood stove or outside int he cold.  My skin stays soft and retains moisture.
B00LCE23JE|5|I did a mask the other night and it was great. Felt clean and smooth. Very nice result and all natural!
B00HF3XSF4|5|exactly what i expected.
B00DDWC8PW|5|I've been looking for a black beauty blender and it's much better than the pink one easy to clean and it work miracles.
B00373HS7K|5|Bought these as Christmas gifts for some of the women in my family. They are very soft and seem to be made well. Also the size is nice and compact, great for a purse brush.
B003GZ5ZXI|5|This soap is gentle enough for hands and face wash.  The soap leave my skin smelling fresh, delicious, and feeling moisturized.
B009DU4QYE|5|Good morrow, sirs. I am here to tell thou of my experience with thy Degrease shampoo.<br />But in all seriousness, as a young man who happens to be experiencing hair problems and I don't know why, I got this from their website (which is more expensive) and I must say! I don't have any light dandruff, my hair is getting bolder and my head is no longer as oily as a bike chain.<br />This shampoo shall slay away any oily dragons which infest your head!<br />Brave on, adventerous knight!
B0009OAICW|5|good
B001183N8G|5|I love this stuff. But it doesnt stay on after first shower. This stuff is great when you need a tan for a day.
B002VA4FWG|4|I've recently put my hair through a lot. It's pretty damaged, but since using this it's starting to get better. I love that it's a 3-pack so I won't run out any time soon and continue treatment of my hair.
B005UL3LVY|4|These are wonderful lipsticks that stays on all day they are great for summer,winter,spring and fall.These is great for birthday gifts and etc.
B0082OYMO6|1|I choose this rating because, I think this is a bad product. The reason I don't like this product is because when i used this it BURNT my whole head really bad. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone
B00G053H6I|2|Items received partially damaged as they were not in any strong packaging and three plates were received bent.  The box they were shipped in was smashed and had an open slot on the site, were one may have fallen out and three were received bent. The designs were not that great so it was not a major issue for me, but still not happy.  The other plates have good designs and are fully functional.
B00H7KTEZ8|5|fast shipment and great product, loved it!!!
B000EH4TLK|5|This product is a godsend. I hope the formula never changes like other products (not just relaxers) have changed in the past. I like that it leaves a little texture to my hair and doesnt completely straighten it limp. Keeps my tresses thick and with body.
B007SNGSFS|5|Replacement refills for my Braun cleaning system. They are genuine factory items.
B005WTYEYW|5|This is more than I expected!  You know how sometimes you get your hopes up and then something arrives and you're like \\"awww, man!\\"  Not this!  I was very excited to see all the sizes, shapes and colors!!  And SO AFFORDABLE!!
B0055EQJK6|5|Love it,and shipping was at time....
B00009RF1E|2|tinker toy
B004E98U14|1|This eyemakeup remover was GROSS!  It was so oily that my vision became blurred and redness occurred on the eyelid even after I had squeezed out the excess on the pad  before applying.  Wish I would have read S.E. Meland's review before ordering but there were so many positive comments.  Threw all 3 containers into the trash!!
B000OYJ9AO|5|bought this for my son and he loved it!  I also purchased a small size perfect for my small purse!
B004BLXG5U|5|I went to the dentist to get a new upper denture and when it was delivered the color was a few shades lighter than my natural bottom theeth.  I used this every day for a week and now there's no difference and looks natural
B00NP8KL62|5|These were recommended by my dentist. They provide a gentle gum massage with their tiny soft bristles. I use them after brushing and flossing and they still remove things that neither floss not my electric toothbrush removed. They seem pricey, but each one can be used more than once - just rinse after use like you do your toothbrush. Eventually they do get worn out, then toss and start with another one.
B00CNTJHQO|5|I have dry, itchy, flaky scalp in the winter months. I love how this shampoo has remedied this. I love that it is all natural and doesn't dry my hair out. And the scent is pleasant. Great product!
B001ADBV8Q|5|This is the only color I wear. Goes with everything.
B007K6JYLS|4|I received this product through bzz agent to sample and review.  I already use secrect solid deodorant but had not tried thr clear gel. It was very easy to come out and once applied it was not to wet and seemed to dry pretty fast. I have a 6 month old who spits up a lot so I change shirts often and before I would notice white marks a lot but with the clear gel I dont have to worry about that! The only thing I do not like is that o seem to go through the clear gel faster than the solid. All in all a great product with great protection.
B000UDGI4O|4|Have been using this on my permed hair and it definitely brings out more curl, especially as time goes by.
B002U6PG06|4|It fits perfect in the medicine cabinet.  When looking it up online it does not give the dimensions which would be helpful.<br />Yes it may be a challenge to retrieve a q-tip if it is not in the container straight but it is not that difficult if you take your time.
B001VEK1IU|5|very good
B000PUK8E8|5|These blades last a long time, they're really sharp and stay that way even after 5+ uses.<br /><br />If you're a barber you might want to use something like the Dovo shavette since you'd be throwing out blades all the time, and Derby's blades are $5 for 100
B000H6A02A|4|My 92 year old father seems to have no trouble operating it.  And he says he likes it.  It's a winner.
B00FMB2XYS|4|Just like any other matte top coat. Not all that matte. It does the same effect as the OPI matte top coat in gel. Its alright.<br /><br />I suggest you do two thin coats of the matte top coat (cure in between of course) and take a buffer that's not that hard griddy one and buff the top off just a little. And you get a really matte look!
B002NDV8XA|5|This brand id increrible, you must try it! My skin feels so good and smooth and radiant! Give this brand a try!
B003UQTOH6|1|I received this product in the mail a few weeks before Christmas. When my wife went to use it their was nothing inside the tube. Very disappointed in my purchase.
B000HJUWRU|4|the only brush i like, it's firm and the correct size
B009LLDAK6|5|I've been using these kind of brushes for more than 2 years. It cleans my teeth and feels so clean, that is why I always order these brushes. If you buy these brushes on other stores they are so expensive, but on amazon.com the price is always right.
B001UTK76C|2|Love the product, but it arrived broken and leaked all over the little bag it was in :(
B000052YM7|2|Shouldn't really comment because I stopped using this after a week. it stung my face a little.  I started using Jan Marini's Bioglycolic face lotion, a little more expensive but great product.
B0002T49OW|5|I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the compact - you get quite a bit of product for your money. My compact came with two wands (next time, I'll purchase it with the brush). A little bit of water, a couple of passes over the cake with the wand and my lashes are super dark, defined, and with absolutely no clumps or balled up bits of mascara. The amount of time it takes is similar to a regular wand in a tube mascara as I found myself having to apply at least 2 coats of tube mascara to get the length I wanted. The mascara is also very easy to remove in the shower with simply water and brushing my lashes with my fingers (not a plus in rainy or humid weather!).
B00HFW8LZM|5|i ordered the red shower cap and it fits great is very comfortable and looks like it is made well.
B0009MFZAE|1|I've seen results very quickly with this product, but I'm disgusted at the packaging that Crest uses. The whitestrips are paper thin, yet the box the come in is enormous.  Not only is the box 3x bigger than it needs to be, but it's double-walled plastic, doubling the waste!    As much as I'm impressed by the product, I cannot recommend it based on the packaging waste.
B004T19KZ2|5|I love that you can use this as blush and lip color, which I do! It's such a nice, natural looking color for your cheeks and I like the way it looks on my lips as well. It's going to last me a very, very long time too! Little goes a long way! Seems to be a pattern with Too Faced products :)
B0052EDNWG|1|Delayed
B00B4D95LC|5|Very nice and utility. Thanks very much!
B001BODNYO|1|I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it's already broken.  It was good while it lasted.  He was using it and it got caught in this beard.
B00KOC09DW|3|I've used this mascara for years and love the product.  Unfortunately Cover Girl changed the plastic or the design of the applicator and the handle cracks easily.
B00CBFFHQ4|1|way too tight.....not happy with them at all.
B00IMHN0B4|3|I LOVED the first bottle of this rose water I received and was on top of ordering another as soon as I needed to. Unfortunately, the second bottle is much different. The scent is strange/strong and is not having the same effect on my skin. Will be trying a different brand.
B001UBA6T8|5|Love this lip brush, it's very well made!!!  No longer need to use a lip pencil, this does the trick!!!!
B004D24818|2|I havent noticed any immediate or general improvement, as I have with other eye creams - seems kinda lame just glad it wasnt expensive or I would be even more dissapointed
B006FMA1NS|5|Love it
B00BM1Y0XY|5|Lovely color,  very gentle on the eye
B00879NGF2|5|Very thick product but I see my hair filling in around my edges so thumbs up to this product
B009L69BOU|5|Beautiful it is a scarf not a vest so don't get confused by the picture and it goes with many things
B000FH9G6W|5|I am so glad I found 273 by Fred Hayman it is his best fragrance ever! I purchased 2 box sets one for myself and one for my sister and now I have family members wanting me to order for them, I hope you have plenty on hand! If you are a woodsy floral scent then this is for you, it is fabulous and it comes in a box set so you can layer your fragrance. By layering you are able to keep the scent with you all day or night, which ever you prefer it is a hit! Mrs. J Wall
B003RSG7YK|5|I absolutely love this wig! It look so natural. It does shed when you first brush it out, but, it is beautiful. Not shiny or fake looking - just natural. I will order this again. I ordered a #2 and it was perfect.
B001GSK80M|5|must have great product!!!
B0002Z914O|4|I think this brushes did the job quite efficiently, definitely will be using mine whenever I dye my hair at home!
B0086VIA0M|5|These clean my sensitive teeth really well.
B00JVXVCS6|5|Best moisturizer I've ever used on my skin. Truly moisturizes!! I mix it with a few drops of lavender oil and rub it between my hands to warm it up. It takes a little while to fully rub in, but I see it as an opportunity for a quick self-massage. Love this product.
B00LI2QYJK|5|very good and fast delivery.
B008RODQGG|5|Works great! It automatically shuts off when the water runs dry.
B00HMUAFY2|5|Love this soap!
B000050FDX|5|I have been shaving with Braun electric shavers for 20 years or so. Loved most of them (especially an old, credit card sized one), but I particularly love my current 7000 series. Smooth, with no hair pulling and I never got any cuts, whether using it wet or dry. Buy one the first chance you get.
B002BTFQAW|5|great tool
B00005NAOD|4|I order this every 2 months for my mom and she swears by it! She loves the hydration she receives from this, only complaint is that she wishes it wasn't so greasy.
B00NCAOET8|5|Some of my all time favorite nail polish!
B003VMF5S6|5|Like I said before , One of the hardest things of buying polish online is figuring out the color (Due to monitor adjustments).<br />I'll try my best to describe this:<br />This is an transparent color filled with a bronze color glitter. You'll need several layers to get it to be a solid  color.<br />Very Sparkly. I loved it.
B00WQAM6IQ|5|Great morning pick me up. This cream is very light and has a wonderful citrus scent that helps wake up your body. It's not greasy so your face doesn't feel weighed down in the morning. The natural ingredients air in not putting a ton of chemicals on your skin.
B0030HNNS6|5|A great gel eyeliner. I have normal eye lids, not oily, not dry. I don't have any problems with staying power and it glides on like a dream. My aunt who has dry eyelids has always had a problem with pencil eyeliners that skip over her dry and aging skin. No such problem with this liner, works great for her as well. Really nice dark black as well. I have had it for over a year now and it still hasn't dried out on me.
B00CBPVDT4|5|A Safe product to use for the family without harsh chemical and smells great also, I recommend this product got the entire family.
B0085NTKEG|5|These wipes are great! The salicylic acid really does a number on zits. They're practically gone the next day! They also leave my skin super soft and have a nice, light and pleasant scent. Nothing too strong or perfumy. Definitely recommended!
B0055HXWN0|5|This hair spray is great.  It words like a hard spray and holds like a hard spray but it isn't heavy.  I love the pink can...really cute!
B00I3OMMCO|5|I got this for my boyfriend and he's been using it for a month now.  His beard was immediately &#34;contained&#34; when the product was applied, which means he didn't have random hairs going in different directions.  Also, the more he uses it, the softer and less bristle it becomes. Great product!
B008533SJ4|3|You need to learn how to use it .It take me  a couple of times to understand that it needs to be keep moist.so far so good.
B00BI9WW9Y|5|I bought this because it's FDA Listed. It works very well and I am satisfied with it.
B002EB18TK|1|The description made by (re-seller) DAB Nutrition (aka Direct Websites; Potential Dynamix LLC) says it is \\"organic\\". If you look at the front of the bottle on the picture it does not say \\"organic\\" but I trusted Amazon. We got the bottle and indeed it did not say \\"organic\\" on the front label. On the back bottom is an add-on sticker stating \\"organic\\" and other official looking numbers. Fishy or not?<br /><br />My wife asks me to do further research since we wanted to use it for our newborn. Newborns have absorbent skins and soak up all chemicals/toxins in clothes and lotions so we try to get organic.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer Desert Essence and gave them the manufacturing batch number (at the bottom of the bottle. They said Amazon is not an authorized re-seller and that it was NOT organic.<br /><br />If you Google the re-seller you'll find more complaints.<br /><br />This looks like fraud to me. I spoke with Amazon and they were very helpful. The product is being returned.<br /><br />You've been warned about DAB Nutrition (aka Direct Websites; Potential Dynamix LLC)
B001GSIADO|5|Looks great, works great! I LOVE IT! Shipped fast, looks great in my home. When i am not using it, i display it as decoration. Its unique and I get many compliments on it whenever I have visitors. (Even from people who have no idea what smudging is) lol
B00YAQBEUU|3|they were stiff, not plyable like others. Great color, just not for me. Fast shipment though, very pleased how fast it came.
B003ZUZDD6|5|This is absolutely my favorite gel color that I own. I have to stop myself from wearing it nonstop. It's a great fun summery color and I think it would look nice with any complexion. Only caveat, it does sometimes take three coats to get the right color.
B00347A89Y|5|Noxzema arrived, loving that I was able to purchase in bulk!!! I will be purchasing this product again in the future.
B002BXDKHE|3|This Is Okay But If You Buy This You Also Need To Buy Nail Primer Or The Nails Wont Stay On. I Was Not Happy That It Didnt Come With It.
B004D26992|5|Seems to be helping with my back acne.
B000H6ZTOE|5|I love this product!  After just one use I noticed a bit of a glow, and it gets a little more \\"glowy\\" after each use.  It's so simple to apply with a cotton ball and dries very quickly.  I've never had any smears or streaking.    I would really recommend this.  In fact, this is the first review I've ever written about anything, so that should say something about this product!
B0090UJFYI|5|Used it a few days now and it is helping keep my acne down and I sure don't mind my smile lines fading away. Will post an update after more time passes
B000L596FE|5|This brush is so soft and gentle. I've never used a brush this good. I personally prefer a good firm brush that will massage my scalp as I brush my hair. This brush is soft and almost tickles as it does it's work. I would call this a magic brush. Try this if you have a super sensitive head.
B002DOO1VA|5|I got it and I'm pretty happy with what I have. I'd highly recommend it to those who want it.
B00NGPMHCK|5|Nice
B00E4GXJWC|5|Can't wait for my little girl to wear these!! Tried them on my son just to see how they looked.....soooooo CUTE!!
B000XE5TSG|5|We were on an Alaskan cruise for our 25th anniversary in 2001 and my husband bought this for me at the gift shop.  We both loved it!  I was disappointed to discover recently that it had been discontinued.  Fortunately I was able to find it on Amazon.  My order came quickly and as soon as I opened the bottle, I felt like I was back on the cruise.  It's a fantastic fragrance and the price can't be beat!  ($75 in stores back then!)  I'll buy more so have on hand when this bottle is gone.
B008X5C8BI|5|Very happy with this order. I think I can do more than six nails with these.
B0062HWVO8|5|I purchased this make-up for my girlfriend for christmas. She really likes the product, only down side is that 2 of the little circles were broken up and unusable, however this is not really a big deal due to the number of choices it already possesses.
B00AAYP8PI|5|nail stickers work great for me because of no drying time<br />these stayed on for about a wk and a 1/2 until they started to grow out and chip at the ends<br />the blue colors are a little on the lighter side<br />all in all good product
B008MBWEP8|5|Awesome color
B00I471LR2|4|I had been using a different epilator for a few months before I got this one, but for the most part this has become my new favorite epilator.<br /><br />One disadvantage of every epilator: if you've never used one before, expect pain.  Once I got past the first few days, I found that using an epilator was better for me than shaving or waxing.<br /><br />This epilator is for the most part the best one I've tried, though I'll admit that I get the best overall results by using this one first then switching back to my old one for a quick pass over the same areas.  The Philips removes most of the hair on the first try, but for some reason there are a few hairs that it will not get, whether I go over the same spot twice or 20 times.  If the old epilator isn't charged a pair of tweezers also does the trick.  Actually, plain point tip tweezers ([[ASIN:B004KS2V9G like these]]) are a good thing to have around.  Since I started using an epilator I sometimes get an ingrown hair--not a big deal, but it's easiest to fix with pointy tweezers.<br /><br />I also have to switch back to my old [[ASIN:B00DM34FKS Conair epilator]] if I want to use one on my face.  The instructions for this one include the warning \\"This appliance is only intended for removing women's body hair on areas below the neck: underarms, bikini line and legs. Do not use it for any other purpose.\\"  I've tried it with no damage, but now that I've read the instructions it seems safer to use an epilator that was designed for use on the face.<br /><br />The \\"massage attachment\\" mystifies me.  As far as I can tell it does nothing.  It might be useful if you've never used an epilator before, to be sure you're holding it in the correct position--it should be at a 90° angle to your leg, not tilted like a razor--but once you've got the hang of it you can probably take the training wheels off.  I felt no \\"massage\\" or anything else; it just kind of got in the way and made it difficult to see what I was doing.<br /><br />Cleaning the head is easy.  I pop it off to the side, brush with the enclosed brush, and rinse under running water.<br /><br />The battery lasts for me for several uses.  I see that other reviewers have remarked on short battery life.  Maybe they got a defective unit, maybe I just got lucky, but I generally get a couple of weeks out of one charge.  It might help that I don't have to use it daily.<br /><br />So it works.  It removes about 99% of the hair, but always seems to miss a few.  It's easy to clean and I've had no problems at all with battery life.  It should only be used to remove hair \\"below the neck\\".  With some limitations, this is the best epilator I've tried.aning the head is easy.

B000RZF2UQ|4|Hate to admit I've been through a few different pill splitters and this is by far the least difficult in maneuvering pills into the upside-down V slot for cutting.  The pills remain in the pill splitter after cutting- other brands I've used do not retain the split pills in its cup.  I originally purchased just one Ultra Pill Splitter and it broke within 2 months of use.  Knowing the other pill splitting options out there, I decided to give this pill splitter a second chance and bought a package of six.  Not only is it less expensive to buy bulk but I figure I'm guaranteed at least a years worth of use!
B00DSJ3QBU|1|The product was beautiful and we received many compliments on it. First the strap buckle broke and in examining the plastic buckle, I discovered it was coming apart where the strap meets the top of the backpack. The zipper was of low quality and I do not think it would have lasted long.<br />I did not carry books in this book bag, but used it as a purse, so it was not the reason it was falling apart. I also do not like the vinyl straps, I do not think this is a quality product. Beautiful but cheap.
B000AA5VZ4|4|I love this stuff.. I have a problem with my cuticles tearing and my nails look old.. When I use this it makes them look a whole lot better.. I use it on my feet also.. It's great..
B0064PM7HO|5|Hold my hear great!
B00BIP6UO6|5|Just what I hoped for.....very nice
B000NL0T1G|3|I have been using this razor exclusively for two years so understand it well. It is of quality construction and beautiful, and I don't doubt that it could last a lifetime.<br /><br />This is my third safety razor, my other two being a Parker twist-to-open and a 1959 Gillette super speed. I had to ditch the parker because of poor quality, the blade sat in the holder at an angle which led to many bad cuts.<br /><br />I can get a very good shave out of the Merkur 180, but have to put some effort to that end. This is a fairly aggressive razor, meaning that the guard sits a farther distance from the blade than a milder razor. This means that you can get a closer shave but run the risk of nicks if not careful. My Gillette super speed is by comparison much less aggressive. For the first several months getting used to the Merkur, I would sometimes get the cleanest most refreshing shave ever, and other times would get an awful shave with many cuts, bad razor burn and still feel rough. After weeks of experimenting with technique and going through different blades in my sampler pack I discovered the root cause of my problems were the posts that center the blade. They are too small and allow the blade to sit unevenly, so when you tighten down the handle, it has the potential to be clamped off-center. In this scenario, one side of the razor shaves nicely, the other cuts badly.<br /><br />Since I learned this, I have taken care to align the blade carefully and have gotten more consistent shaves. For me, the Feather blades work best. Astra, Sharks, and Merkur blades also treat me well. I have noticed this razor is fairly unforgiving of less quality blades and can get many nicks off some brands, esp. Wilkinson Sword. Beard prep is also of utmost importance: take a HOT shower and wash and rinse well getting lots of hot water on beard to soften it. I use Nutragena cream shave (have tried a dozen brands and found the slipperiest works the best). I shave with the grain and do a light second pass against the grain, rinsing in between. I have a very coarse beard but sensitive skin, so have to be careful in my technique. I figured out how to make the razor work for me, but feel that it shouldn't be this finicky.<br /><br />The reason for the three stars is only because the posts that center the blade don't center it. Really, its the most important function of a razor, to hold the blade squarely. It doesn't do its basic job.<br /><br />A little while back, I acquired my grandfathers old Gillette super speed and was blown away by how much easier it was to get a close shave with no nicks. This is from a 54 year old razor. The reason it works better is it grips the blade perfectly evenly and has a less aggressive blade position. Blades that I passed off as rubbish before shave well on the super speed. It was this discovery that prompted me to write this review, that when you find the right razor for your face, you will instantly know it. Prior to a few weeks ago, I thought the Merkur was great but trying something new made me realize how much effort it took to get a good shave. I'm not faulting the Merkur for not being right for me, but for bad blade positioning.
B0036LMFYO|5|I have really bad Acne and well with this soap it has helped me get rid of them little by little. Also I had some really scars on my face do to acne and little by little they have gone away... of course this is not the only thing that I'm using but I starting using this and I had great results from it.<br /><br />Also a friend of mine had really bad dry skin on her knees and I told her about this soap and since she has been using it... the dry skin has been going away too. I really love this soap I tell everyone about it.. :-)
B00FDIK4PU|1|Have not seen the glow. Gritty.
9790790961|5|I love this perfume!!!
B0081V75CQ|5|Highly recommend this purchase.  Great price and fast delivery.  I will be ordering more when I need them and will recommend to all my friends.
B0002DMZA8|5|I bought Jean Paul Gaultier by Jean Paul Gaultier for Men - 1.2 ml EDT Spray Vial.  The smell is so great. I tried it on in the night and when i woke up, I still smelled the great Jean Paul Gaultier;}
B0065I0UMO|5|I really like this.  It sinks right into the skin.  It has a whipped-like texture which feels good when applying.  I basically use it for my face, though my husband used it once for his dry skin.  Only once because he said it did the trick for him.  I think the skin on my face looks better overall since using it.  I would recommend it to others.
B008YKNLWM|5|Excellent product.
B00JF2ON5C|5|This is one of the only soaps that my daughter can use.  She has very sensitive skin and soap with dyes causes her to itch and will sometimes give her a rash.  This soap inexpensive and works very well for us!
B009VGMW28|5|Love the mask, shampoo and conditioner from Alfa Parf. They keep my keratin treated hair smooth and clean. Very affordable too, as opposed to the salon bough products. And this line provides the same level of cleanliness and smooth look to your hair.
B00LHCOO2K|4|Hey guys! So I ordered this hair Monday and received it today which is Thursday. It's very soft no tangling or shedding! It has a regular hair smell to it. Can't wait to install it. Definitely worth the price! I usually pay 200-$400 on 4 bundles so yeah check it out
B00M29TEQI|5|It was just like they said. It is working just fine for what it is used for.
B00JT6X0KI|1|The fabric was to weak. It tore putting it on
B006BIF0IW|5|Great quality at a great price.
B0014ST5Y4|5|I have had mine for about two years. Battery life is great and it cleans great. I use it every day. I have not read the other reviews (What is the point? I already have one). It runs for about 15 minutes. It can be a little chattery but I just put a wash cloth underneath it (squared) and it is better ... it also does not walk away ... however ...<br /><br />I do not like the cleaner they reccomend. There is something funny about it (maybe too aggressive) and I found that the cleaner made my retainers \\"age\\" faster. I use Efferdent in the cleaner with warm water and occasionally (not always, as it is not needed and adds to wear and tear) use a baby toothbrush to lightly brush them.(Brushing invisalign is not reccomended as it wears on the invisibility of them)<br /><br />Result? My invisalign retainers are always clean, always fresh and stain free, and last a VERY long time.<br /><br />I sat listening to my cleaner run this morning and realized ... I have had this thing for just over two years and I use it every day and never wrote a review of this great little product ... so there you go :)
B003CA0LRW|5|I use this shampoo because my scalp gets a little flaky during the winter months due to dryness. The shampoo tingles and feels refreshing. It's also safe for color-treated hair.
B001A3KWU4|5|Excellent Product
B000C4SBJQ|5|Prompt delivery, product works very well
B00HLPV5Z6|5|Love it
B008SIZ2OK|5|This is an amazing set of small tapers. Absolutely love them, and they burn brilliantly! Love the variety of colors as well
B004Z67NSM|5|This refill pack last a long time and its an awesome value to buy this size. Highly recommend this system.
B0033I9OSK|5|Many brands of scent don't mix well with my body chemistry, but Chanel does! I have worn Chanel #5. Chance, and now am on my fourth year of Coco Mademoiselle. I wear it every day and still love the scent. The twist and spray applicator is easy to use and no scent is lost due to evaporation. Worth the money!
B0013FIVEI|5|Very good. As advertised.
B008OIGD1U|5|Great product at a great price.  Arrived before promised date.
B009E234Y4|1|It doesnt come with Shader Needles
B00IEG2K2S|5|These sponges work very well.  I will order them again.
B011W865RU|5|My dad loves this ring. He' says it's really comfortable. He was always worried about damaging his wedding band which has a lot of diamonds on it. And he works with chemicals. But with this ring there's no worry at all.<br /><br />I was lucky to get this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review
B000HUACKG|3|I had one of these for ten years, and recently misplaced it.  I ordered two of these to replace it, from different companies, although I did not realize that at the time.  One cost $6 dollars more than the other, and two different blue colors were used.<br />Neither was as efficient as the lost original.  The cutting edges have small nicks and so don't cut cleanly in different areas.  One squeaks and needs oiling, I guess - not what you want handled around nice clothes.  Overall, I think manufacturing standards have lowered.  But finding a straight cutting ege is difficult, and I would rather have one of these than a concave or convex curve that won't fit my nails.
B00LPP2I8Q|5|My favorite earrings by far. I was pierces with these three years ago, and still wear them. Unlike the shorter post, and the secure backing, because I wear them 24/7. Anubis have stretched ears, so only small studs look good and these are the perfect size.
B00IOY5FGI|5|Great shampoo to use if you use Keratin treatments.  It leaves my hair soft and healthy.  I swim laps at least 3 days a week and my hair is doing fine.
B00347FTXE|5|Love this affordable product!!
B000HBOIMS|5|Excellent
B00GMP7942|5|I love this product! I've been using it for a few months and love the way it leaves my skin feeling.
B0049LUI9O|5|My husband likes this nose hair trimmer and the fact that you can rinse it.  He likes the circle style better than the straight comb style and this one works great.
B0032VFB5I|5|Smells AMAZING, leaves hair soft and salon-feeling. Color-safe.
B000OB56B8|5|I love these socks so much. I wear them for 20 minutes and my feet feel so much better. I can't wait to buy more.
B001540XWK|5|I bought this at the local drugstore after deciding to color bits of my hair BRIGHT SHOCKING pink. of course i read reviews on the product BEFORE buying it.  the quality of the bleach was okay. it could have been better, but you get what you pay for.<br />anyway, the color the pink came out in my hair after leaving it in with foils for a little over half an hour is AMAZING!  it's been nearly 2 months since i highlighted it pink and it's STILL hot , bright shocking pink! i love the quality of this dye. the only thing I don't like is the 1st few washings after the dyeing teh color bleeds like crazy. other than that it's high praises from this chick. oh, the dye smells kind of like fruit. its not smelly like other dyes.
B004TGUKG0|5|This epilator is amazing.  I've been using it for a few years now and it still holds a charge just as good as the first day I got it.
B003TBPG5G|5|It is risky ordering makeup online because of the color shades & quality.  But I took a chance on this one based on the positive reviews and the fact that I wasn't satisfied with bare minerals, and it really paid off.  I ordered the 12g sifter in fair and the shade is perfect.  My skin always has been on the fair side, especially in winter.  I don't bake myself in the summer (like I did as a teen) but do get slightly tanned from everyday exposure. I was using bare minerals in med golden (for the summer) but it was a little too golden. It is a good makeup but left my skin very shiny within the first hour of wearing it.  But after trying THIS makeup I find there is no contest.  The coverage is excellent, the finish is beautiful, there is no shine, the shade (although choices are more limited than with bare minerals) turned out to be perfect and the price is a bonus.  It lasts all day and may require a touch-up if it's going to be a long day.  I also love that it is available in a refill bag (also priced nicely) which I will definitely be ordering in the future.
B00LZFUUAE|5|I bought this for my wife after we remodled our bath and she loves it .
B00GYF29T0|5|This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. Not only does it clean and whiten my teeth, it keeps me from getting cavities. I don't know about you but I don't like going to the dentist. So anything that helps with that is great in my book.
B003BVINRC|5|great blade has 5 so you cant miss a hair
B000FRHWM2|5|I love EO products in general, but this is one of my favorites. A light lavender scent and it doesn't seem as drying as regular hand sanitizers.
B0094IUIKQ|5|This may very well be responsible for new hair growth. I think I have been using it for 4 months now.
B000ZSWQAE|5|My mother, her sisters and cousins all wore this at one time or another! Wow! It's something how the scent of something that you loved so long ago can take you right back and stir so many emotions and memories. If you've ever loved this fragrance, but somehow lost track of the product, you can now pick it up on Amazon at a reasonable price. I received this as a gift, and I was quite touched. I'll be back for more!
B000W8P8F2|5|This product absorbs in your skin so well without the oily residue. Its very soothing and rejuvenate my skin so well. Love it!
B000FQ73O0|3|I am 49 years old male and after 3 months no noticeable growth. I still have hair but it's thinning on the front hair line and has receded about a half an inch over the years. Maybe this product will slow down the hair loss but I don't think I'll ever see hair growth at my age. Great price for the product and I have not experienced any side effects.
B00KYJ8WGQ|1|Dont buy it<br />Its wasting money<br />And its very small contener i used just for my neck its not even enough for one week and did nothing for me
B000ALDLJG|5|I love this so much.  I used to buy this at macy and they are the same brand.  I love them.
B00B7E0B48|5|Wow, Rocky Mountain Wood is wonderful. Two LIGHT sprays on my neck and one of my wrist and I'm in heaven. This is a true forest (after you've hiked in a bit) experience, with nothing feeling fake or synthetic. I'm not really sure how they bottled this smell (more like a memory than a cologne), but I am impressed.
B006FJKK1Y|5|Love this deep conditioner. My hair is smooth, silky and soft after using it. Definitely recommend. Will be ordering more of this stuff.
B002HK2GTE|5|I've been a nail technician for almost 14 years, and I couldn't live without my Tweezerman Power Hangnail Clipper.  I use it instead of a conventional cuticle nipper, and it is the best.  Easy to use, and allows you to be more precise.  Great for getting into corners on those ingrown toenails too!
B008BLAJWO|5|I enjoy using this conditioner knowing it is not stripping my hair. A little pricey but I will definitely purchase again.
B0053UWKUK|1|I got this product about 3months ago and I was using it as a daily leave in conditioner for a small course or thick compact afro. I found that after placing the product in my hair it would come completely dry and leave a grainy residue, that look like flakes of dandruff, which would force me to do a Co wash ( using conditioner in stead of shampoo) promptly after applying. It is very thick beige creme that you have to use gloves if you dont want it to stick to your hands, the smell reminded me of crown royal hair grease, so not terrible, but not great either. I didnt notice any regrowth or anti breakage properties either with this product, so I would not buy it again simply because it was costing more money to buy additonal products to remove it from my hair.
B00L0R5494|5|Love these colors. Couldn't find this in any stores. Colors nice and rich. It's my go to case everyday. Great for any skin tone. I'm Japanese with tan complexion and I love it. Can go from day to night with same colors. Can't go wrong with Mabelline. I'd buy extra eye sponges, I have 6 in mine plus the one applied it came with.
B00O5AKYZW|1|Received it today, it does not work, it won't even come on. ...very disappointed
B002201F4G|5|The order was on time.  I have been wearing wigs lately and these fit the bill.  My hair is shorter and this keeps it out of site when wearing the wigs.  Thank you.
B00006JN51|1|Have not worked, been exercising, dieting and still no change,,, been using twice a day and a couple weeks now still NOTHIN do not purchase
B002XITZ08|5|I got this from after I found out my local Macy's price was more than double, my wife love it, she said it's a new packing comparing with the old one, which apparently had a darker blue color, and it's really light!
B000YBZIAC|5|I first found this soap on Cleopatra's Choice and ordered it. Works great on dry winter skin. Makes your skin feel soft and relieves the itch of dry skin.
B00GPHIDT2|5|I like it.. Good!!
B004NZDY42|3|Its ok,i received it a few days after i purchased..Its kind of small for me..But other than that its ok.
B000XGC6MQ|5|Great product.
B0086VIA3O|5|Much longer lasting, money saver for real
B000Q34X8Q|5|Smells heavenly !  Arrived in great shape and sooner than expected . Thank You !!
B003AL01KU|2|I bought this because I was intrigued by it. It just seems so bizzare, I've never heard of something like this in the states. Besides, my skin is very dry and using this seemed like something I needed.<br /><br />At first, I did not think it was working. My skin soaked it up very quickly and my skin did not feel softer so much as it just felt more firm. I was a bit upset, so I stopped using for a few days, thinking why bother, it wasn't doing anything. However, after I stopped using it, my skin got extremely dry! I started using it again and lo and behold, my skin improved. The results of this are not dramatic as I was expecting, however using this once or twice a day really does keep my skin healthy and flake free.<br /><br />However, I have found two uses for it that I believe work better than a skin mist. This is the best product I have found for my hair! My hair gets very dry and frizzy due to the winter weather, and this stuff is awesome at taming my hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. It also appears that with continued use, my hair has gotten stronger and I am not shedding as much. I could be imagining it, but it sure seems like it, I am cleaning my brush out less frequently than before.<br /><br />Another use I found is as a hand mist. I have eczema on my hands and soaps really don't help matters. I spray this on after I wash my hands and my eczema is almost completely gone, which is rare in the winter months.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really nice product. It has great benefits and I am seeing results after over a month of usage.<br /><br />EDIT: 11/29/12<br /><br />I have dropped 3 stars from this review for two reasons. One, I finally found the ingredients for this product and it contains parabens and other chemicals that I do not want on my skin. Really disappointed.<br /><br />Two, I found out that any product claiming to have collagen in it is fake. Your body can't absorb collagen, it can only produce it, so putting collagen on your skin or eating food with collagen does absolutely nothing. I thought micro collagen was different, but that too is just a marketing gimmick :( Really sad.<br /><br />2 stars for price and it's good on my hair and it did help my face, but I won't be using this anymore and I definitely won't be buying it again.n your skin or eating food with collagen does absolutely nothing.

B00015XAQA|5|Great, gentle, natural face wash at a decent price.  Skin does not feel stripped after use.  Fabulous natural essential oil scent!
B0018CBCAG|5|love the size of the waves but i wouldnt recommend this on hair with no product in it. it will totally make it frizzy. other than that, awesome product. well worth it at that price!
B0068QSP66|1|I read on the internet that this was the top rated product for eyelash growth, so I did a test.  I used this product on one eye and another product on the other eye.  This product was a great big zero!  Really cannot recommend it at all.
B001S261Q6|5|Both this item for my daughters who constantly get knots in their hair. My oldest has super thick hair with tangles daily, and my youngest has fine hair with even worse tangles and knots. We tried several differnt brushes and combs to see what was gentles on them. (And that they would let me brush their hair with without crying because it hurt) We always use spray hair detangler on their hair before brushing, but it didnt help much either. They still hurt. So I researched de-tangling online and came across this brush and decided to give it a try. I was sceptical I have to be honest. The same maker also has a super cute pink flower pot version of this brush for kids, but it was twice as much in cost. And I wanted to try it first before I bought that one. Just in case it didn't work. Well, it works like a charm, as a matter of fact my girls fight over the brush and who gets it first in the mornings when they get ready. On top of detangling nicely it also makes the hair super soft and shinny too. My youngest calls it the Magic Rapunzel Brush. I have even tried it on m own hair and it is great. I think I will have to brak down and buy them each their own ones. I saw that the maker has this regular brush style, not the flowerpot one, in different colors too, I will try and find pink ones for my girls.... Anyways, love the brush, really a big help and lifesaver for my girls hair and my nerves LOL<br />Highly recommended and I will buy more!!!
B00838FLXW|1|Product arrived as described and on time but I think this product is better in theory than in execution. It seems that the amount of needles spreads the penetration out over too large a surface and doesn't really penetrate so much as scratch. I guess it is like lying on a bed of nails vs a small amount. Don't really see this being return-able or else I probably would and just get one with 192 needles. Oh well.
B00149RO3M|5|This is a beautiful, bright red, not garish at all. It is particularly nice on the toenails, with a tan and sandals. Like all OPI polishes, it is long wearing. I recommend using a clear top coat e very few days to keep the pedicure looking good.
B00HNS1UN8|5|This is such a pretty color! It is my favorite and I recommend it!
B00SP22VGG|5|Great product. Only used it on my face so far. I must say it is amazing.
B003BVINQI|4|I received these from a BzzAgent campaign and I can honestly say I'm a fan. The five blades give a ridiculously-close shave, though admittedly, they do make reaching some &#34;problem areas&#34; (near the lips, edging of sideburn/hairline) difficult. Schick handles this by including the flip trimmer, and because of that, these disposables really do have everything I could hope for in such a product.
B008AMKZUU|1|I've had plenty of luck with other plates but the two Bundle Monster sets I purchased gave me nothing but duds.  I have not tried every single plate but I have tried about half and so far I can't get a decent transfer off one.  It's so disappointing because the designs are great.
B00IA6ZYX4|5|Great for the hair.
B002ISVF2E|5|Great product. Would recommend it to everyone.
B001OLZNLA|5|I have only seen this perfume for sale in two stores in Charleston, SC.  I love it and no one else wears it! High quality and I always get compliments.
B001JJBC9Y|5|For the past 2 years I have been giving my husband his military haircut.  I started out well and I continued to improve my skill over the years.  I used various techniques to make his hair look at its best and I did not expect it to be any better with a better or more expensive clipper.  My old Wahl clipper was falling apart and it had never been the best of qualities, so I decided to get a new set.<br />I bought this item and I now love to give my husband a haircut.  All of the techniques that I used before to make him look better seem to me now like an effort to disguise the lack of a good clipper.<br />I use this clipper without issues, I am faster, the cut is more precise and it looks better than ever.  He looks like after a trip to the barber and all that I changed was the clipper.<br />This clipper was the best thing that happened to me in my history of being my husbands personal barber.<br />I love to use it and the only wish that it leaves open is the following:<br />It doesn't make my husbands hair grow faster to make me use it more often....<br /><br />You really don't need to spend $10 at a barber every week when you got one of these... and it therefore pays for itself in less than 2 months.
B00IS6XPQY|5|I have used this product for a about a month now and see a HUGE difference.  I lost my eyelashes and this product brought them back. I would highly recommend it.  I love that this product is a family based business.  They take care in ensuring the products they are using are not animal tested and they are products that work to grow your lashes.  I have looked and tried many other products and this one hands down is my favorite.  I use it day and night and follow the instructions, I feel confident that is why it is working for me.  If I had to give a recommendation, order the product.  IT WORKS.
B000E0G0AK|5|I want to preface this by saying that I dye my hair a dark but bright red. I am not sure how this product would do on someone who dyes their hair a lighter color. For me, this is a miracle conditioner. My hair is naturally dry as has a coarse texture. I am always looking for a great conditioner. I typically use a regular conditioner and a deep conditioner twice a week. I was able to use a small amount on my shoulder length hair and got amazing results. As far as the color portion I haven't noticed my color to be very different or that it has stayed any better. However, it is red and it naturally fades quickly. So honestly if you color your hair or if it is naturally dry I highly recommend this one.
B00A2W4ZX4|5|This product is so good!  I'm not sure how it works but it makes your hair soft and smooth.  The pricing on Amazon is excellent.  I checked it out at salons in my area and the prices were double.  Don't hesitate, it's a great product.
B0039OFQNU|2|The nividea lotion to put in this must be made of gold dust and unicorn shavings because it makes using it rather expensive. The shave is OK if used with the lotion.
B00N9QX84M|2|Really light. Barely noticeable.
B004Z209HS|5|I am so happy to receive the product.  The oil has a great quality.  I use it for my hair and my hand.  It makes my hair silky and hands softer.  I am very happy with this product.  You only need a size of a pea to get the result.  I definitely will order again.
B00AA7ILHM|5|It´s a really nice case and it protects my cell phone front and back.  It doesn´t affect the cell phone anthena like other cases.
B009SJ7DFE|5|I love this and wish I'd known about it when I had long hair in fact that is the reason I finally cut my hair because I couldn't put it in a bun or make a decent pony tail.
B0021AFWXC|4|I happened upon this model while browsing Groupon one night. I'd never even heard of epilators much less ever used one. But I decided to give it a whirl. It was only $40. I have to say I am very impressed. It literally paid for itself after just one use. Regular Brazilian waxes were costing me $50 every few weeks! I'd say it's definitely worth the investment! I had initially purchased it as an alternative to shaving my legs. But after a week or two of trial and error, I decided epilating my legs is not for me. The amount of time required to maintain smooth legs just wasn't worth it. Plus having to exfoliate my calves every shower to avoid ingrown hairs & bumps? No thanks... I could just use that time to shave. However, I have found it a blessing for getting rid of underarm hair. It's amazing! Takes just a few seconds to get smooth underarms that last for over a week! Yesssssssssss! One less thing to worry about!<br /><br />Many people reading these reviews are probably wondering about the level of pain involved... I will say... it's its own special brand of torture. lol Epilating my underarms doesn't bother me at all. My lady bits area on the other hand.... sweet baby Jesus. Waxing is so much easier, faster, & less painful. But I'm a total cheap ass. I can now get the same results (if not better results) at home. For FREE. I no longer have to plan & make appointments. I have control over my vagina! HAHAHA!!<br /><br />In all seriousness though, I would highly recommend this product.
B006M1AN4E|5|Works wonderfully! My chest acne has been greatly reduced, as has the bumps on my upper arms, in a matter of 2 weeks.<br /><br />However!! Very important!!! WEAR SUNSCREEN IF YOU ARE REGULARLY PUTTING THIS ON. The AHA causes your skin to replenish itself much more rapidly, so you're a lot more susceptible to sunburn and sun damage (which means dark spots, pre-mature aging, and all sorts of terrible things).
B0096WARIS|5|A few years ago someone recommended I try monolaurin for my allergies.  Over the years I discovered the commercial version from Lauricidin the best, as it appears to be of higher quality than the competition with consistent results.  Amazon typically offeres better prices than local vendors.
B003RW2K0G|5|Best way to control my curls without lots of product on my hair. Can't even tell it is in my hair but it does the job. Gives me nice curls without the frizz.
B00GMP05YS|5|I use it as an ingredient in home made clothing detergent. It works great.
B00020URJW|4|Functional and beautiful
B0043NSR2I|5|In recent decades I have used clear & Aloe based shaving gels. Most of commercial shaving creams and gels don't provide protection against razor burn. I thought I'd give this one a try and I'm Very pleased with this product. Sometimes I use it just by itself and other times I prefer to use it with my other aloe shave gels. I'll continue to buy and use this product.
B009BTMW20|3|I've been having trouble getting the rollers to roll - I don't know if it will improve in time. I gave up on them and am using some stainless steel rollers that I got. They are pretty, though!
B000FLJU1O|5|This is a great skin product, it protects from the enviroment, an antioxident and repairs the skin, it is used in most skin creams and lotins. I like using the pure oil, it moisturizes and repairs. i have been using it for almost a year and i can see the difference in my skin, and it isnt very expensive. I love it.
B001UU9MSA|1|the vest was not comfortable enough for my son to wear. I will contact the company return it.
B00DG8EZKO|4|Keep the skin really smooth
B00CAKALYS|3|2 of the bundles were okay, one was dry.  I used 2 1/2 bundles unfortunately I used the bad bundle in the middle so after a week and a half my hair kept matting up. I cut the ends. It work, conditioned it that help. Its okay for the price. I suggest you deep condition before you put in.
B00G0O6YKA|5|looooooove THIS COLOR! A friend recommended it to me so I went straight on amazon to find it. It lasts almost all day! Best lip color i've had
B00ESNF2NA|4|seems to really work well in neck tension
B00756HQNQ|5|This works fantastic! I am able to gently grind off access dry/dead skin and I don't have to put a lot of effort to do it.
B000GCLU42|5|I've had recurring bouts of MRSA infections on my skin. I have started scrubbing with Hibiclens and the first site of a lesion and it has kept them from going any further, and healing quickly. Much better than another course of antibiotics over and over again.
B00FYSZDXC|5|This is highly recommended if you color your hair.  I can't be without this cover up.  It is truly amazing.  It doesn't come off on your clothes or pillow cases.  It stays on until you shampoo it out.  You might consider getting a shade lighter than your hair when purchasing.  My hair is dark brown and this light brown is a perfect match.  This is worth the money.
B00AFCP2Y2|5|Great hold with no flaking. I used to use hair wax and went back to gel after 8 years of the wax. Great product and lasts all day. I usually go to the gym at noon and my hair still stays in place afterwards for the rest of the day.
B00IES42YK|5|It is good, burns a little bit but cleans my skin very deep, I use it with my led light and I can see an improvement on my face
B00KY4Z1I8|5|Arrived quickly, works great. Makes excellent almond milk!
B00IBTUOAI|5|I love the red color of this nail polish.  I'm also thrilled with the fact that it doesn't have a lot of the harmful chemicals that can cause issues with nail health.  It lasts as long as other polishes as well.
B00XQRBSLO|5|Helped my hair a ton!
B00EOB0042|5|Great stuff. I was looking for an alternative to Tom's, because, well... Tom's just wasn't working out for me. Tom's is widely available and I like that, and it smells like lavender and I like that too... especially because standard mass-market deodorants and antiperspirants smell like horrible chemical awfulness. I just don't want to be scented that artificially. But with the Tom's, I was finding that I wasn't always smelling as sweetly as I desired. There are specific shirts in my wardrobe that I knew would be stinky by mid-afternoon, and that's soooo annoying because damn, they're cute shirts. And I'm not a particularly stinky person. No bueno! Not sure why it took me so long to figure out I should try and find the top-rated natural deodorant on Amazon and give it a go.<br /><br />Green Tidings lavender rocks! I've been using it for about a week. My stink problem is completely gone, even on those shirts that were notoriously stinky by midafternoon, and I loooove the way this Green Tidings smells... not purely lavender, a little more herbal and grassy. Citrusy, maybe. Fresh. It's a little trickier to apply, I suppose because there is a lot of coconut oil in there... but if I just hold it against my skin for a moment and let the very top layer &#34;melt&#34; a little, it slides right on. I kind of like the way I smell now. It feels like a luxurious little treat just to use this, and that's an odd way to feel about deodorant. Like, I can smell it as I type this, and I like the way it smells! What a treat. I'm buying it again!
B002UQ7XQG|5|Compact and doesn't look to girly!
B0040UOO9E|5|Super fast shipping and a very comfy fit. Doesn't dig into your scalp and love the design. It is just as described.
B001F0QX1E|5|Product works great.  Don't over do it!  If you have sensitive skin,  I'd recommend slowing down the applications to ever other day or more.
B00OSB2J8I|5|I love this product.  I have seen visible results in just under a month.  My crows feet around my eyes are less visible and the moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.
B000C1VWAE|4|X_X at first I did not like this scent very much, it to strong and spicy for my taste but after the 2nd day of wearing this fragrance I got used to the spicy scent and started liking it slowly. a couple spritzes here and there is good enough(and the scent and pheromones do last a long time), if you spray to much you will get a headache and its very unnecessary . and the pheromones do seem to work a little(some guys I work with were more polite to me then ever),but do not expect too have a large amount of men all over you! this is not some kind of love potion that will bewitch men into liking you,however you might receive better treatment from some of them, they might be more friendly,polite and talkative then ever    I give this 4 stars because it works, the smell will just have to be getting used to
B000H3WNXM|1|I tried this in the privacy of my home before wearing it out in public--fortunately. It was a matter of seconds before the dress's halter top came away from my skin. The sad thing is, the dress actually fits perfectly by itself, so the tape didn't have much work to do--and still it failed.<br /><br />Maybe packing tape would work better.
B00AKHWTK2|5|I bought this for my daughter, she loves it! It is very sturdy and a great size
B002CLJ8KS|5|Will never go back to multiple disposable razors EVER! Screw all the commercials bout multiple razor blades giving you the best shave of your life. All it'll give you are additional razor burns and razor rash.
B000QSPDO4|5|beautiful and amazing good smell worth the cost. good for kids too. i love it, so much, yay. great job
B000068PBT|3|My husband is always complaining how these are of so lesser quality than the ones that came with the shaver. They should try to make the replacement ones as good as the original ones.
B001XURHBQ|2|The shaving soap is fine, Col. Conk is pretty good shaving soap, and the container seals tightly, so that it is good for packing away.  My issue is that the lid is so close to being big enough to make lather in, but you can't.  So, unless you bring a separate mug/bowl, or lather on your face, this container gets annoying.
B00OSJTUDC|5|I love this scent, I get candied lemon, not much strawberry(it's more of a sugar note), whenever I wear this I feel like summer and instantly feel happier. This is a light fresh scent, more suited to warmer weather but is still one of my favorite Love Potion variants.
B001UIQ2QC|3|I like the hold. It is not as long lasting or firm as my old Sebastian molding mud (discontinued!!), but it is ok. Not as good when my hair is wet, it loses texture and my hair poofs out too much..I am not crazy about the pepto bismol smell .. minty-ish..<br />Not a good reason to not just use it up, but I am still searching for the next great thing.
B000KKIP3O|5|Oh man I love this stuff!  I am a 62 YO man and this helps my grey hair shine like crazy and holds just enough so as not to weigh down the style. Works better on shorter hair. My &#34;man-card&#34; is solidly in my wallet so c'mon old dudes, get sexy!
B003QUUND0|1|This are very thin, very small emery boards - they are good for one use only and then they are done.
B007IIHZ6O|5|I'm using the rinse & the whitening system (including the rods) and am very pleased.  I could see a difference with the first use, and a &#34;real&#34; difference by the third or fourth use.  I have a few veneers, and this works really well in lifting some of the yellow staining around the gum line.  I've been using it for two weeks, and will continue to use it.  I now use my regular toothpaste in the morning (because of taste/cleaner feeling), but then use the supersmile once or twice a day.  I did buy the dental floss, but have no way of really knowing whether it works better than any other floss.  I've started to use it when I have the supersmile toothpaste still on my teeth, but it's a little messy that way.  Having benefited from the system, I recommend it.
B0017KCPUK|1|Like others, I purchased this item after using a crystal nail file and being impressed with the results, though I dropped it and it shattered so I needed a replacement. This particular item is good for about 1-2 uses, after which the texture is no longer sufficient to get any results from it. I rinsed it, stored it in a drawer in its case, didn't use it on anything but fingernails, and it should have lasted much longer. Save your money and time and buy a different crystal/glass file.
B00070E8IS|3|But I have terrible upper body strength. The cord and plastic are very high salon quality. I have hair past my lower back, though so unless it's a double barrel it doesn't make much of a drying difference to me.
B007YT34TY|4|They are comfy and get the job done!
B00139OECC|5|Best hair fixing wax available in the market
B00G2TQNZ4|1|Its NOT organic. Has so many ingredients that lead to skin cancer.
B002K8W1UC|5|Love this stuff! I have super sensitive skin and this keeps me from breaking out and keeps the oil under control.
B001BSFDAW|5|Very good. Thanks *****
B00D5MQHCK|2|I bought this product hoping that it would work better than Biore pore strips, which work well for me but only come in strips and I wanted to cover other areas of my face.<br /><br />After the first two tries with only removal of some flaky skin and what little tiny fine hairs I have, the blackheads remained.  Then I tried steaming my face and tried product again.  Still blackheads left behind, but flaky skin and hairs pulled instead.  I have steamed my face longer and again have used the product, still same results.<br /><br />What I can say...  It is difficult to start peeling once it is dried.  I feel like I am digging at my skin to get a section to peel started.  It BURNS when I initially put it on.  The burning sensation lasts for the first few minutes. A strong smell of what can only be described of as burnt plastic until it dries.  Though it has not removed any of my blackheads, it has left a black residue in pores that were clean.  Must scrub off my face again to get product residue off my face.<br /><br />I did like that it pulls off dead skin cells and leaves my skin smoother feeling, but it doesn't offset the burning sensation and the lack of removal.<br /><br />Awfully expensive to not work.  Biore pore strips trimmed down to fit in areas (like under the nose) work better.  I'm extremely disappointed.
B0000AFUT3|5|This make-up mirror was hard to find, but good ole Amazon.com came through. I never go out without full makeup, so I am the \\"makeup mirror expert\\". This mirror is the best. It has every feature you will need plus an electrical outlet right on the front.
B001ECQ3PY|5|We spend quite a bit of time in the sun and have often found it hard to get a good quality sunscreen, that is safe, and that works. This sunscreen is great. We use it for surfing, snorkeling, kayaking, hiking, or days spent in the sun. Although we do try to limit our sun exposure, we also enjoy water sports and we live Hawaii. Nature's Gates has a good product that you can trust.
B001E0VOW8|5|It smell really good and lasts a long time. It's not drying and best of all it's all natural. yeay!
B001MA0QY2|5|I was used to paying well over $100.00 at least once a year for my previous curling irons.  The reviews I read about the HSI Ionic Flat Iron convinced me to try it soooo I bought one along WITH my usual $120.00 Flat iron.  The HSI iron arrived first and after I tried it once I was sold.  When the expensive iron arrived I sent it back the same day!
B00BEWWAKG|1|ordered the light blonde and my hair turned out redish. thank god it was only for underneathe my hair. my hair is nauturally dark dark brown so that could have something to do with it.. my roots did turn out bright blonde though.. i ordered another box to try this again.  So i dyes it again. Hair already lightened up and very orange from the first application. And the second time around didnt do anything. Just made my hair a lighter orange. Now i see why its so cheap. Its Stupid. Dont waste your money or time.
B005HYNI30|5|I used to buy 50% glycolic acid but found 70% is much better.I use it  to cure seborrhea keratosis on my hands.
B0077XDTLA|5|Great gel, holds strong and smells amazing
B00HDHQQCE|5|I use this as an alternative to a fancy matte wax that I like.  I still use the matte wax when I need a certain effect, but this is my go-to daily product.  The wax feels natural in the hair, and gives it a look and feel which is unique and great.  It would be difficult to go wrong with this product.  If you don't like it, you can almost guarantee that someone in your family or network of friends will, and as someone who's used to spending ~$12 on matte wax every month, I love that this bottle never seems to go down. I wouldn't be surprised if the bottle lasted for years.
B00JEMRH38|4|This is very nice product, but not for people with oily skin.. I was pregnant in my first trimester when I started using it and I felt like my nose was covered with butter.. I waited for a while, my skin got back to normal and now I enjoy using it.<br /><br />it gives your skin really nice color and your skin can breath...but don't expect it to cover all skin problems, this thing will only moisturize your skin and make its color/tone even, which is a great thing for every day life.
B003UKM9CO|4|We chose the oral B electric tooth brush as a replacement for an older model, which still works.<br />The new one has nice blue color and a led to indicate when charging.<br />We also have a years supply of brush heads for it. Iwould recommend it to anyone looking for a good electric tooth brush.
B0089MUOOS|5|I've just started using the product and it seems to be working very quickly! I've only been using it for about a week, so it is not fully cleared but it has improved GREATLY! The lotion does not stink, burn, stain, or cause any slimyness. I love it so far!
B0046VERJE|5|Love this color and brand and very happy I was able to find it here on Amazon!
B000UUNIL8|5|I have used this product every time I have shampooed my hair for the last 10 months. It does not take very much and it definitely preserves my color.
B00MW7YSDY|5|Love this foundation.  Can't find it in store anymore.  This is my color.  Perfect,  brand new, packaged well.  Thank you.
B00375L8KG|5|I have sensitive skin and this cream never breaks me out.  It also leaves my skin soft and it really is moisturizing all day!
B00PYHQ5L2|5|I had never tried this brand but thought it was worth a try.  I ordered the small kit so I could try it without committing a lot of money.  It is wonderful.  I am 64 so my skin has some &#34;issues&#34; but I really like this product.  The Purity is especially good.  I will use this again.  All I can say is, &#34;Try it, you will like it&#34;.
B00L2RFR58|5|I adore this company! I am not one to follow skincare regimes. I usually buy a couple cheap things a year, use half a bottle, see no results, and toss it in a drawer. And repeat.<br /><br />Not anymore! I started using the toner, Hyaluronic acid+ vitamin C serum, Vitamin C facewash, and Super Youth moisturizer twice a day a few weeks ago and have seen a great improvement in the texture, softness, redness and dryness of my skin. Most importantly, I saw a dramatic improvement in my nasolabial/marionette lines. I am 32 but have thin skin and spent many years working in the sun, and was considering fillers for the ever deepening lines from my nose to the outer edges of my mouth because of how they were aging me and making me look tired and unhappy.  I've tried everything to lessen them but they continued to get deeper and more pronounced.<br /><br />The combination of these products has saved me from the needle! The creases are much more shallow, smoother, and less noticeable after only a few weeks. And I am a skeptic, folks, but I LOVE this product line. It has saved my skin. Though they are powerful, they are not harsh. I have sensitive skin prone to redness around my nose and eyes, but this has evened it all out. It is gentle on skin but tough on signs of aging.<br /><br />And to seal the deal, they are USA made, Vegan (no animal testing!), all natural, and the prices can't be beat. You CAN afford an entire line of this stuff. I probably go through two entire bottles in a year of each product. A little goes a long way.
B007W608N4|4|It's perfect for the face instead a simple towel
B0015POQ6I|5|When I saw this brush I thought that it would be similar to the Franks Synthetic (FS) that had enjoyed. I noted that it had more of a whiteness at the where the FS had black tips. So I went on to order the brush.<br /><br />So I received the brush and was surprised at the size. I normally like brushes with knots in the 20-25 mm range. This brush was large compared to what I was used to using at 28 mm on the knot size.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that is looked more like a Silvertip Badger than the other synthetics. The brush is dense in fact it is much denser than any other brush I have. Now that I have this brush, it is time to see how it performs.<br /><br />Once I got use to the size, I found this to be a very good brush in terms of application. I was able to negotiate the ears and quickly apply lather to the back of my head for the head shave.<br /><br />Here were some areas that I observed about the H.I.S. brush.<br /><br />Water retention: Does it hold water sufficiently enough?<br />Yes - In fact you need to shake it lightly about 3 times or you could have too much water. This holds water exceptionally well due to the density and quantity of fibers.<br /><br />Loading: Does it pick up soaps and creams easily?<br />Yes - It is very efficient. A little soap or cream goes a long way.<br /><br />Lather: Does it built and apply lather well?<br />Yes - It is a real lather monster.<br /><br />I used it with Fitness Soap in a mug. It made enough lather for 4 1/2 thick face passes (2 of them I simply wiped off because I had finished face shaving). Then it made 2 full head shave passes with thick lather. Afterwards, I was able to squeeze the brush and get a larger wad of lather at the finger and thumb. This amount of lather was made with one dip into water with a three shake to reduce moisture and only 2 swirls to pick up the soap. No additional water or soap was used. I also used it with a nickel sized drop of C.O. Bigelow cream and got the same results.I think the density of the brush fibers is so high that it creates a very strong lather production due to the fibers moving against each other.<br /><br />Application: Does it allow for a soft/smooth/effective application of lather to the skin.<br />Yes - The lather went on smooth and easy every time.<br /><br />Quality feel: Does the synthetic brush have the \\"quality\\" feel against the skin?<br />It has a soft quality feel against the skin.<br /><br />Appearance: Is the look of the brush attractive? Yes.<br /><br />One additional thing about synthetics is that you can be a little more rough with them versus natural hairs and not have a problem with them. They will not bloom or change shape. In my experience I have found is, what you get with a synthetic is a uniform product that does not change over time. That has pluses and minuses which each user must determine for themselves if a synthetic is right for them.<br /><br />In conclusion, would I recommend this brush to others.<br />Yes! In fact, I have ordered a backup brush because I like this one so well. You might just want to give this brush some consideration if you are looking for a nice synthetic brush in the mid price range.
B00I32AN4K|5|I have tried so so so many different products, it's ridiculous. That last few years (I'm 43), I started having so much gray and I now color it regularly. It became so dry and frizzy. I do have thick hair, but not curly. I always have used an oil before blow drying. Right now I use HSI which I really like. Any heavy conditioners/masks I used, I needed to use a lot to get results and still always used the oil. This stuff is flipping amazing. I barely use any, goes through my hair so easily and does an amazing job. I still use a little oil for protection from the blow dryer and straightener if I decide to use it. But my product use is a fraction of what I have used in the past. And my hair is so much healthier. I don't need to straighten my frizzies if I don't want to. My hair looks great drying and using just a roller brush. The fact that it works great, and I use less fits both my wallet and my beauty needs. How often can I say that????
B00789UP8S|5|This product worked good. A little too good. The box says 30 days, and so far it's been 3 months.<br /><br />I have naturally very curly hair. Straightening it with an amazing flat iron would still be a long process & I'd keep a comb on hand for touch ups when out. I like wearing my hair down but always had it in a ponytail because it flies, frizzes, & 'fros up everywhere. Forget about running your fingers through it during the day.<br /><br />This was my first home kit & I got it because of the great Amazon reviews. It was easy enough just like the directions & testimonials. I just wanted to have a little bit easier time managing it straight for awhile, & to see how I liked the whole idea.<br /><br />I miss my curly hair & probably won't do it again because it's taking much longer than I thought to even go back to a slight curl. However I give it 5 stars because it does the job well. It was easy & inexpensive. If you do straighten your hair all the time, or were thinking of spending $$$ in a salon for a Brazilian blowout, just get this instead.
B00KSJA7HE|5|This is a great moisturizure. It is thicker than I expected but it is light enough to wear in the daytime because it isn't greasy at all. It doesn't really have a scent but is pleasant overall.
B002UD52M6|5|This is great for colored hair.  I would recommend that the seller package their products better, however.  This came with no packing and the lid was loose, so I lost some of the liquid.  Other than that, I would recommend this product.
B00NY5NGPE|5|I have struggled with acne all my life. Now I also have to worry about wrinkles too. This product is amazing! The second you put the serum on your face, your skin feels rejuvenated. It looks and feels healthier. I don't know if that makes sense but that's how I feel. I'm on my second bottle and I can't imagine my skin routine without this serum. It really does help with acne and signs of aging (it does what the label says it will do. That's rare these days!) I am just so happy to finally have a product I love and want to tell others about! Do your self a favor and give the age-defying & skin clearing serum a try.
B000JPMMPM|5|Out of the box and on my face. Very close shave and easy to adjust.<br />While I'm shaving I think of all the money I have wasted on the &#34; newfangled razors&#34;, and wish I had gone back to the double edge sooner.<br />Great price , great quality, great shave!
B000EGIEYY|5|I was expecting maybe a clear laquer and was surprised that this in an oil.  It dries though almost instantly and does not get oil all over everything.  The best thing is it does work.  My nails still break but before this all my nails were as short as they could be ( I dont bite my nails ever) and now I do have nails growing on all fingers.  I do alot of dishes and have my hands in water alot so it is hard on my nails.  I also dont remember to use this everyday and it is still working. It would be great if I did it as directed.
