B00000DD1S|5.0|This two-CD collection of live recordings from the late 60s should be essential music in anyone's jazz collection. Not just for historical reasons but because it is such exceptional, moving music. I believe it was Nat Hentoff who described them as 'speaking in tongues.\\" The description is accurate. In the solo sections, the Ayler brothers --especially Albert on tenor and alto saxophones-- sound like voices shrieking in ecstasy. And the background is phenomenal --cello and (one or two) bass together, most of the time violin as well, with either Sunny Murray or Beaver Harris thrashing away in irregular cadence on drums. Names aren't terribly important in Ayler compositions, nor for that matter are the heads. It's when they break into preaching --solo voices, occasional intertwining duets-- that Albert and Don take us to another place. This is not immediately pleasant music, but, hey, neither was john Coltrane's Ascension, the recording that most seems to me to be have an affinity with this one.<br /><br /> I listened to recordings of Ayler when they first came out and hated them. More fool me!
0060989157|4.0|I just finished reading the book The Dirt, a semi-autobiography of the 80's band Motley Crue. It's a great read that is pretty mesmorizing. All four band members write about their childhood, the crazy period where they become the most famous band in America and then the post-fame period where they turn to drugs and amazingly hot chicks.<br /><br />The middle section of the book is how the Crue got from a great live act to becoming a hit. They were constantly selling out shows on the LA Strip but none of the record labels wanted to sign them to a record deal. This was the early 80's and the entire industry thought that New Wave was the thing to be and Rock was dead. A 20-year old intern at Electra convinced the head of A&R to let him sign them. They then rel-released their first album and went on the next year to sell 5 million records. Even with that success, the label wanted to drop them because they didn't like their image. After the next year when they were the top selling artist of the year did Electra decide to stick with them.<br /><br />Throughout the book Nikki Sixx emerges as the only one who understood what the band's direction was. He wrote most of the songs and consciously decided they should be a crossover from hard rock to mainstream. He also seems to be the glue that held the band together. He also was dating Lita Ford for most of their early days but eventually broke up when they went on tour for 18 months. They toured with Ozzy, who was even crazier than they were. He eventually married Baywatch star Donna D'Errico.<br /><br />You also read how much drugs they took in both their early days. They were constantly doing coke, heroin, and anything else they could get their hands on. As a result they destroyed almost everything in the path and they hooked up with anything that moved. Both Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee overdosed and almost died, Vince Neil got into 3 drunk driving accidents, and Mick is a full-blown alcoholic even today.<br /><br />You also read about Tommy Lee's marraige to Heather Locklear and Pamela Anderson (who he dated for only 4 days before they were married). Also about Vince's solo band and all the tragedies they've encountered along the way.<br /><br />The beginning is pure rock and roll and the end is just sad. You would never think that their lives would be so hard but they all really struggle just to make it day to day. I guess a bunch of ego and booze and drugs will do that to you.<br /><br />Note: i just saw here they're making a movie from the book with Val Kilmer and Christopher Walker rumored to play Ozzy and David Lee Roth.Heather Locklear and Pamela Anderson (who he dated for only 4 days before they were married).

B000R7HY0K|4.0|Out of the two, i would have to say that i like Planet Terror a lot more then Death Proof. Here's my thing with Death Proof, it is a nice seventies homage, but its mostly just all talk, Tarantino style. and while this is entertaining after awhile, it gets pretty boring after the initial pass. however, i must say then when the action does happen, it is well worth it, the last thirty minutes or so being not only thrilling but hilarious at the same time.<br />Death Proof has a relativly simple plot. a deranged stunt man who stalks his victoms and then kills them with his car. Russell obviously has fun with the role and all the 'girls' have there own fun with the roles their given, especially Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms.<br />My other complaint is that, i don't know what exactly happened, but somewhere along the line, the whole grittiness and beat up method used in the movie sort of got lost in the second half. Why this happened, i'm not sure, but its just something that sort of disconnects me from the movie.<br />And finally, about the whole splitting up the film thing, i'm not bothered about it much. But i am bothered that they've cut out the trailers, now see i loved those, i thought they were inventive, funny, and just a blast to watch, escpecially Thanksgiving, so hilarious!<br />I do hope they re-release Grindhouse in its original theater content, trailers and all. But for now, if you love homage movies and Tarantino flicks, then definently go with Death Proof.
0316010669|4.0|An engaging and easily read essay on the way we think, and how \\"shooting from the hip\\" isn't always such a bad thing...when it's backed up by experience.  Gladwell's research into an area completely removed from his own  arena of expertise is detailed and thorough.  He approaches the subject with enough humility and honest curiosity that the reader feels he is more along for the ride than being lectured from the podium as are most tomes on   psychology and sociology.  Especially noteworthy are his many references to specific studies and the occasional invitation to participate in a few prove to be...illuminating to say the least (I swore I wasn't bigoted, until...).
B0002S947K|5.0|Listening to this cd has made me an instant fan of Ray Lamontagne. I, being a fan of soul and folk, have been tickled with Ray's beautiful melodies. His lyrics are emotionally charged and they create a place for the listener to experince the deep issues of life. Ray's voice helps the listener to experince passion and a small sense of longing. His songs are about love and the reality of a person's internal issues. This cd is a must have in any music collection.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Joe Strummer And The Mescoleros-Streetcore *****<br /><br />Released in late 2003, Streetcore is easily Joe Stummer and The Mescaleros' best album. Where Globel A Go-Go, and Rock Art And The X-Ray Style had moments of weakness, Streetcore shines bright from the openeing notes of 'Coma Girl' to the last drone of 'Silver And Gold.'<br /><br />Streetcore was released just weeks before Strummers untimely and tragic death. The power, the pain, and the conviction that Strummer had been known for his entire career comes across here clearer then ever before. He had finally realized he needs not impress anyone anymore, because he had already impressed us all, many, many times before.<br /><br />His song writing chops come through on songs like 'Come Girl' 'Get Down Moses' 'Arms Aloft' and 'All In A Day.' His use of imagry and socialy concious attitude is premenant everywhere.<br /><br />His love of Reggae is brought to the forfront of one of the stand out tracks 'Get Down Moses' which may be the very best thing Strummer ever wrote, maybe even better then his solo work as well as his legendary work with the phenomonal Clash.<br /><br />Also on the cover of Bob Marley and The Wailors' 'Redemption Song' his love of reggae comes through. This is better then the original. May seem impossible but Strummer kicks it up a notch yet without changing the slightest thing. Divine!<br /><br />'Long Shadow' is without any shadow of a doubt the very esence of Strummer. The vocal harmones are reminicent of early Clash, but even at that with a the grace of the Clash, Mick Jones and the boys could have never hoped to create something so angelic. The lyrics rival that of Strummers all time best and even that of his hero's Woddy Guthrie and old Mr. Zimmermen (Bob Dylan.)<br /><br />Streetcore is the end all and be all of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. Even though it may play out like a solo album none of this would have been possible without his boys.

0812976525|3.0|Thank You for Smoking is a collection of caricatures, each more clever than the other.  The Mod (Merchants of Death) Squad is a great concept, and the cigarette, alcohol, and firearms pitchmen that comprise it are outlandish uber-parodies.  The same with the Captain (Doak Boykin), the urbane, old moneyed, vaguely racist, mint julep drinking tobacco industry leader with the weak ticker.  There's even a Malboro Man equivalent, the rugged Tumbleweed Man.  All are so over the top as to be ridiculous, yet something tells me they're exactly as Nanny state politicians and class action attorneys picture them.<br /><br />Of course, the politicians are just as unctuous- philandering liars who can be bought on short money.  The histrionic anti-tobacco activists don't come off pure, either, exaggerating statistics and exploiting kids with cancer to further their aims.  [After all, \\"smoking is the nation's leading cause of statistics.\\"]<br /><br />The character development was far and away TYFS's strength; the meandering, unrealistic plot was its weakness.  The story line is pretty thin, and the book's climax is unfortunately its least believable aspect.  In general, there is a huge conspiracy afoot that requires you to swallow an awful lot.  Some characters and subplots are brought up without any development, such as Nick's son, and the idea of making a movie to revitalize onscreen smoking.<br /><br />Still, the characters and their excellent dialogue alone make this worth reading.  Major character and smoking spokesman Nick Naylor's charm, spin, and rationalization of why, for instance, cheese is worse for you than cigarette smoke, make for an unforgettable character.  Buckley's use of imagined newspaper headlines, and fictitious dialogue from minor players like Larry King and Oprah are inspired.

B000EHRVP6|5.0|This film is one of the goriest horror films I've ever seen.  No other film has made me feel as uncomfortable and wince like I have in Hostel.  Maybe I'm inexperienced in watching modern horror films, but I've always thought that I had a thick skin and strong stomach.    The film starts off with three friends traveling Europe for some fun.  They are having the time of their lives with drugs, alcohol, girls and just acting like fools.  When in Holland, they meet a guy who tells them about a place in Slovakia that is brimming with attractive women who go nuts over American men.  They follow this guy's advice and travel to a Hostel in Slovakia only to later make a frightening discovery.  There is an underground organization that pays money to people who can get others to come to an abandoned factory where they are brutally tortured to death.    All of the torture scenes are very unsettling.  Granted that the trio of main characters in the film where acting like jerks in the beginning, we still start to have compassion for them.  Regardless of what they did or how they acted, no one deserves to be tortured like that.  For me, the most unsettling scene was the part where the woman's eye was hanging by its optic nerve and was severed.  The cut achilles tendon scene comes a close second.  Even sitting here writting this review and thinking of those parts gives me an uneasy feeling.    Jay Hernandez gave a brilliant performance.  I'm looking forward to watching Hostel part 2.
015626224X|5.0|If you're down and out read Down and Out in Paris and London. Most likely you'll change the outlook on your situation.<br /><br />George Orwell gives the lowdown on being downright poverty stricken and homeless in Paris and London in the 1930's. The book's graphic detail and description gives the reader a woeful glance of the ugliness of life on the street. Some of the psychos, freaks and weirdos he encounters are a bit difficult to bear at times, and I even suggest SKIPPING chapter 2 entirely. It was awful and disturbing! Don't read it expecting \\"mercy\\".<br /><br />Aside from that chapter, the book is interesting and absorbing and will open your eyes to a day in the life of society's poorest, whose purpose in life is merely to survive.<br /><br />Despite the above reference about chapter 2, it's a quick and easy read. If you, like me, are unfamiliar with the small amount of French in the story, babelfish.altavista will come in very handy.

0671646788|4.0|David J. Schwartz wrote this book nearly 50 years ago, but its principles are as fresh as the latest positive thinking seminar. Attitude, says the author, determines whether people embrace opportunities in life, and how they handle difficulties and challenges. He teaches that professional and personal success is rooted in self-confidence, conviction and optimism. Schwartz's advice and recommendations hold up, though you may wonder what planet you're on when he refers to $65 weekly salaries and $1,200 down payments on homes. Life obviously has changed dramatically in the past half-century and, considering the vast number of self-help books on the market, Schwartz's ideas hardly seem revolutionary, though they may have been at the time. We believe this classic retains its valuable foundation: A basic, useable approach to pursuing a happy, purposeful life.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|One thing I have always admired was how honest Pain of Salvation are with their lyrical content, and how they speak their mind, unashamed of who they might offend. This album seems to take that characteristic to a new extreme. It is lyrically, perhaps their most cynical, mordant, and scornful album yet, and also their most brutally honest work to date. At the same time, it is their most eye-opening album to the world around us, scrutinizing mankind's ongoing troubles, habits, greediness, and overall foolishness.<br /><br />The first two songs, \\"Scarsick\\" and \\"Spitfall\\" feature Gildenlow's \\"rap\\" vocals, which definitely aren't anything new, I just personally don't think it's the most terribly appealing way to start the album off, but they certainly don't ruin the song or anything. Both of these songs feature a great chorus to balance out the overall melody and rhythm of the song.<br /><br />If someone unfamiliar with the band were to look at the lyrics to \\"Cribcaged\\" they might see the string of \\"F-bombs\\" as immature garbage, however this song's lyrics couldn't be more meaningful; describing how we are obsessed with celebrities' lives, perhaps more than our own children's lives (although that seems like a bit of a stretch) and that celebrities are \\"just people\\".<br /><br />\\"America\\" is perhaps the most offensive song they have ever written. Being an American, I didn't like this idea at first, but after reading the lyrics I really don't blame them at all for some of the controversies and criticisms explained here, rolled into nifty, disdainful little Metaphors. The song is extremely catchy, and honestly, I can't get enough of it.<br /><br />\\"Kingdom of Loss\\" is another one of my favorites. They talk about how everything is \\"on sale\\", from \\"War\\" to \\"Fear\\" to \\"Sex\\" to \\"Self-Confidence\\" and the ironic chain of events of buying things such as buying fast food, getting fat, and then buying a Stairmaster machine to lose the weight from the fast food, etc. Some of the spoken parts might seem a little corny, but I think they put it together great and the music is quite dramatic and composed very well.<br /><br />\\"Flame to the Moth\\" is quite perhaps one of the most adrenaline-pumping songs I have ever heard. This may sound contradictory considering I own a lot of straight death and black metal that is overall heavier, faster and contains 100% harsh vocals, but the way Pain of Salvation construct this song and build up to that spine-shattering chorus is one-of-a-kind. The music also matches the honest lyrics describing being an innocent child, and as we grow up we see the cold, money-hungry world full of lies we live in. This is another classic for these brilliant musicians that I will always admire.<br /><br />The album ends with \\"Enter Rain,\\" a 10-minute epic, emotional song that seems to be most people's favorite, perhaps because it is so traditional in structure, it sounds like something from \\"Perfect Element I\\" or perhaps \\"Remedy Lane.\\"<br /><br />Like any other Pain of Salvation album I have ever bought, this album has rapidly and immensely grown on me from the first few listens. I find it incredible how that always seems to happen with their albums. I think that means the songs are deeper and take more time to sink in than if I liked every song instantly. It may seem like my respect for the band is maxed out, but every album makes it grow stronger., but I think they put it together great and the music is quite dramatic and composed very well.    \\"Flame to the Moth\\" is quite perhaps one of the most adrenaline-pumping songs I have ever heard.

B00004YW6I|5.0|I'd heard PJ Harvey over the years, as her music has appeared on multiple soundtracks I own. And I'd never heard one of her songs I didn't like. But I never owned one of her albums. Then, on CNN.com they had Time's Top 100 Albums of all time, and lo and behold \\"Stories...\\" appeared. I thought, what a strange selection amongst Ray Charles, Led Zeppelin, Joni Mitchell, The Beatles, etc. So I bought the album.  There was no doubt in my mind after one listening, this is not only as good as any of the aforementioned artist's work, but sometimes better. And the modesty... she even let's Radiohead's Thom Yorke take the lead on one song, apparently conceding just for the better of the project. This sort of rare artistic integrity is so rarely seen and so very welcome. I played this CD at home, in my truck, at work for a month straight non-stop! And I even shy away from putting back in any player as it becomes all I want to listen to.  This is an incredible collection of songs. PJ is a genius.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|For some reason, I feel as though I needed to begin the review with that title. I don't want to falsely give someone the idea that I am reviewing the band's first two albums.    With that said, it upsets me that fans sem to only like aband that stays comfortably within the confines of what a fan sees as good/great music. I personally love it when a band does something that no one expects out of them. And, not only does LP do that, they do it so good they make you forget that you even disliked the new sound.    The album itself is not a far departure from the rap/pop/alternative infusion that made the band successfyl. It is the result of what ahppens when a band pushes themselves. I think that the album drips with personality, heart, and emotions.    The band does get political, and at times a bit lovestruck. But, what the band does not do is depart entirely from their edge and sharpness. Chester's voice still pierces the heart, and oozes with emotion. The basslines take hold. Shinoda's vocals and lyrics take you to where he was when he got the inspiration for the song. It's a full fledged, heavily worked on album.    The only downside is that the album falls short in the productiond epartment. While the lyircs and overall effect of the songs still fills the listener with emotion. The way the album was put together seems a litle haphazard. You finish the album wondering if you got a version that was half finished, or if you burned all the tracks right. Essentially, you are left wanting something more. Not that it's a bad thing. But, it is the major critique I have for it.    in essences, I appluad the band for striving to do something different. And, after listening tot he album a few times (not 10, like one reviewer suggests) and reading the booklet, you get a sense of what LP was trying to accomplish. Now, whether they did that or not is left up to the audience.

B000GY729M|3.0|I'm not a Killers fan. I liked a few tracks from \\"Hot Fuss\\", but I was not impressed enough to become a fan. However, upon first listen to \\"Sam's Town\\", I was more inclined to take another look at the band.<br /><br />Admittedly, I am not a fan still. But, I am interested in the music and the genre that the band attempts to create. It's not a pop/rock, and it's not an alternative. It's like a fusion, with a little techo mixed in. For some reason, Flowers' voice flows over certain tracks. And, interestingly, the poetic and sometimes over the top lyircs work well at times.<br /><br />However, it's the hit and iss that makes this album fall short. While you have highs like \\"Uncle Johnny\\" and \\"For Reasons Unknown\\", there are lows like \\"My List\\". Still the overall storyline effect the band was going for is executed, however unstable it may be.<br /><br />Not the best sophomore effort, but not the worst. Worth a listen for tracks listed as highs with the addition of \\"Read My Mind\\" and \\"Bones\\"

1878424114|4.0|This book is a solid read for any person embarking on the path of self-discovery. It summarizes a group of spiritual laws that Chopra identifies as being key aspects in one's ability to fulfill their dreams. It essentially provides a foundation for further study as opposed to being a comprehensive self-help/development manual. One caution for anyone who is new to this \\"path,\\" is that some of the content might be a bit farther out on the metaphysical curve than you've experienced previously, and particularly so if you're coming from a rather traditional religious perspective.
032147404X|5.0|Even though the first review (by Brien Malone) on this book gives 4 stars, Brien's tone really made me think twice about buying this book.  I'm so glad I bought the book and ignored Brien's review.  The author, Scott Kelby, wrote a book and there are a handful of pages where he makes some jokes -- big deal.  The bulk of the book is chocked full of great tips that are very useful and very practical.  The author makes very clear when he's kidding and when he isn't -- and the bulk of the \\"kidding\\" happens in the first 6 pages when the reader has just begun.  Don't let Brien's review fool you, this is a great book.  Those who chose not to buy this book due to Brien's review should revisit their decision.
0345347951|5.0|I just finished reading Childhood's End for the third time, the first being around 20 years ago as a teenager.  Something about the novel has more relevance to me today than it did then; perhaps it's having children of my own, or maybe I've learned better to appreciate the thoughtful, philosophical themes here.    In short I think the novel is a masterpiece.  Three reasons:    1.  Purely on a narrative level, it is an engaging page-turner.  The characters and events are consistently intriguing, and there are enough compelling mysteries throughout (why are they here? what do they look like?) to keep it entertaining.    2.  As speculative fiction it holds up wonderfully, and is probably more relevant today than when written.  Published in the pre-Sputnik days of 1953, Clarke's description of modern society 50+ years later rings frighteningly true in places.  For example he projects that people cease caring about achievement and have become passive sponges of popular entertainment.  He also foresaw, in the Overlords/Overmind, the mysterious and potentially frightening consequences of superintelligent AI -- a theme that is now common in speculative fiction but remarkable in the 1950's.    3.  Deserving of final mention is the beauty of the writing here, which evolves from a plot-driven action story into a meditative, poetic, and bittersweet look at the future of our species.  Everything dear to humans vanishes in the end, and yet the author asks us to look beyond the sadness and apparent horror.  His parallel to childhood is clear from the title:  We must accept the melancholy truth that for a thing we love to develop into its full potential, it must grow into something we will never fully understand.

I felt like I was reading the vapid travelogue of a LA Valley girl, not a New Yorker. Like it was especially written for Oprah.  There's nothing new or really that insightful about the subjects or places she covers... If you're going to write about Divorce, Love and God, please tell me something new because it's covered ground - stamped down to bedrock actually. \\"Over-indulgent, cliched, search-for-self by well to do 30-40 something woman\\" is right. You would think that she might draw out the characters she meets - and they might be interesting - but they're all cute little caricatures on the blissful way to Bali.  None of them are remotely real. It reads like a travel narrative that is worth picking up at the doctor's office, but not when you have so many other better books to read. Yes, I'm a man. But I worship other female authors. Karen Blixen, Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein; they have minds. Are we that lost that we have read this regurgitated self love spoiled goddess hippy lore and call it original? She should really get off the meds and think about what she's writing about. Not just write down drivel so she can feel happy about herself. But then she's laughing herself all the way to the bank.

There are no \\"hits\\" on this collection but an interesting blend of introspective and melancholy songs with some traditional English/Irish tunes thrown in.  This would not be the best CD for those not familiar with Knopfler's solo work.  For that I would recommend Sailing to Philadelphia.  I saw Knopfler in concert a couple of weeks ago with his band- it was great, if you have a chance.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|I love the music but because the sound quality is so bad I will never listen to again. I thought that Rush's Snakes & Arrows was the worst sounding cd of 2007 but it has been surpassed by this recording. In a time when people are buying fewer and fewer CD's, I think the artist and the record company owes it to us, the buyers of the WHOLE cd, not just the GOOD tracks, to have the good sense to make them sound as good as they can. If you not sure of my golden ears, just listen back to back two cds that were release on the same day, Bruce Springsteen Magic and John Fogerty Revival. If you want to know what a cd should sound like buy the John Fogerty cd!
B000KRN07S|5.0|Whether folk, country, jazz, pop, or whatever music style she pleases, I will listen.  She has the curiosity and imagination to travel to these areas and beyond. This is the voyage of a musician that is gifted with a conscience possesion of her own naivete.  Her minimalist piano and guitar virtuosity is the canvas for the delivery of her exceptionally pure art.  Telling glimpses of her life, thought, and truth seasoned with dreamy fairy tales of moonbeams and lullabies.  She does all of this and more, with a voice that is the sexual-audible equivalent only comparable to Emmy Lou Harris, Dolly Parton, or Diana Krall.  I hope she still throws in the classical tune now and then, and doesn't feel pressured into creating all her own new material.
B000002GQJ|5.0|The middle section of \\"Question\\" is in my opinion one of the prettiest melodies ever written. When Justin H. starts singing \\"I'm looking for someone to change my life\\" , with all that raw emotion in his voice , I still get goosebumps after hearing this album hundreds of times. Many versions of this song are available from live recordings to re-recorded studio takes---this is the one to own.
B000UR366S|3.0|Shine is definitely not a lacklustre album, but those who were hoping for another album in the vein of Turbulent Indigo and Taming the Tiger may be a bit disappointed. Shine lacks the lustre of those albums and is also more modestly produced.    To me it feels as if Joni Mitchell has retraced steps to Hejira and tries a different turn from there. I would probably have found this album earth shattering if it had been the next album after Hejira.    Still looking out for the next album, though...
B000OYC3J8|5.0|the last album was just okay. this one is wonderful. they jump between genres and create tight, fun, great tunes. this is one of the few albums in existence that i can listen to all the way through, repeatedly, and get down with every single song.    good stuff.
B000002J1M|5.0|A masterpiece of an album. \\"Horizons\\" serves as an appetizer for \\"Supper's Ready\\", which is Genesis at it's very best. Can hardly wait to hear the remastered version that is on the horizon (pun intended).

B000GQLCXC|4.0|I read this on bus and plane rides recently, and wondered if I'd fall asleep despite its concentration on an issue that intrigued me: how do languages evolve? Do we decide what words fade and which expressions survive? And, are languages doomed to decay? Word-mavens bemoaning the idiocy of our current state of English, or any other language, compared to the glories of past prose and universal literacy and elegant wit will be disappointed. Deutscher begins with a string of citations from the past, with a mandarin amidst his philistine generation hearkening back to a Golden Age now irrevocably vanished.<br /><br />Language, he assures us, will always morph on two principles: economy and expressiveness. In speaking, we tend to be lazy. Our mouths move in intricate fashion to shape sounds. We tend to take shortcuts. Over time, endings erode and prefixes rot. Their residue collapses into the center of words. Meanings compress into the core. This, in time, frustrates us even as we inadvertently contribute to language change by our collective action, as users slowly adopt to what individuals, seeking order, impose in our quest for logical, systematic syntax. What appears to horrified schoolmarms as regression to the inarticulate is, Deutscher insists, the course every language must and has and will take. We seek the easy way out in speech.<br /><br />But, we also turn restless. Unhappy with worn-out expressions, we invent new ones. Analogies captivate us and we want fresh ways to communicate what matters to us. So, we build up new endings, invent new verbs, add new prefixes, and twist and turn meanings and phrases into vibrant, contradictory, or plain attention-getting forms. For instance, he cites \\"wicked\\" as used by old ladies coming out of a theatre to comment on the performance; this is contrasted with two teenaged girls using \\"wicked.\\" The first pair mean that the entertainment was \\"bad\\" or \\"evil\\" or \\"immoral.\\" The second pair convey their delight in its imaginative qualities, and give a positive spin to the word. In the course of a few decades, we can witness, he shows, language evolving as we listen. No one person controls this, but we adapt to the innovative gradually, and the change happens so gradually that for a while (as with many familiar usages) we will understand both meanings. In a century, we can predict, \\"wicked\\" will have reversed what we today regard as its primary definition.<br /><br />The roots of these principles are buried in our minds, our perceptions, and predate by arguably hundreds of thousands of years our few recorded instances of how we talk and write. These, being so recent, offer fewer clues than many of us imagine; our language may have been around 100,000-40,000 years ago and itself rests on the way we separate actions from objects, and thus nouns from verbs, static from (potentially) dynamic entities, and what can change vs. what endures. Primates and some lower-level animals share these abilities of cognition, and out of this understanding, Deutscher explains with immensely learned, marvelously diverse, if often recondite examples, we create sounds to match what exists in our minds, our world, and our emotions and activities-- a tremendous wealth of symbolic and practical power.<br /><br />When I read John McWhorter's \\"The Power of Babel\\" a few years ago (also reviewed by me on Amazon), he explained that languages decline from an overly complicated order into a simpler one, rather than-- as we'd expect-- vice versa. McWhorter's book complements Deutscher's. McWhorter wished to defend language against critics bemoaning its death throes, and supported the vigor of language shifts. Still, I had wanted to find out more about why the earlier stages of language were so declined and conjugated and structured so rigidly, systematically, and (to me) overwhelmingly.<br /><br />Deutscher offers a solution, at least as much as we can know from the comparatively brief information from a few thousand at best out of probably at least a hundred thousand years of language. \\"A reef of dead metaphors\\" becomes his guiding metaphor!<br />We compress and erode language by our wish to economize. The rich detritus itself generates material to build upon the rubble and create structures that rise, like an ancient city stratified, ruins leading to higher ground and material to build syntactical patterns and form neologisms and extend analogies and spin off metaphors anew. Even the dense, rigid Semitic languages that we can glimpse from 5000 years ago themselves may have grown from eroded roots, and this process of growth and compression, rising and falling, may be ingrained in the way we manufacture language.<br /><br />The book addresses a general reader, but is not easy reading. He does not pander to a reader, yet he also takes pains to find hundreds of examples from our daily patterns of communication to support his scholarship. He popularizes his findings from many linguists (see his footnotes that carefully record his energies and his qualifications-- he draws upon a dizzying range of studies in dozens of languages) This etymological excursion proves bracing. Parts-- as he warns in one later chapter fairly-- can be rather eye-glazing. Linguistics can be daunting. Yet, its laws and controversies and jargon, as with any science, reward careful investigation.<br /><br />Illustrations scatter throughout, many rather superfluous such as clip art engravings of historical figures. However, the family trees of languages and the maps of Indo-European and Semitic language groups are drawn elegantly by hand and enhance the volume. I would have liked more explanation of why Mark Twain's famous complaint about women being neuter and turnips being feminine in German might have been based in structural categories; Deutscher dismisses much of an investigation into this as beyond the historical record early on but in a later chapter raises the point again only to repeat that most languages have such categories rooted in originally if irretrievably logical earlier groupings that already, by the time writing came along to document such usages, had altered beyond the norm. Also, the manner in which verbs emerge from prehistoric, non-grammatical utterances of objects and things alone appeared too hazy. I realize these are both topics whose origins rest thousands of years before any records, and they may be beyond our capacity to fully explain. Still, I wish more attention had been given these elusive situations!<br /><br />This serious, yet engaging, book demands attention, and Deutscher exerts considerable effort in making linguistic erudition understandable. This may be suited more for time (as my commutes) when you can get lost in its pages for hours at a time. After reading it, you will understand how metaphor and analogy embed themselves in so many more profound ways than the obvious. Language, as Deutscher lovingly lists, drifts and crashes and coalesces over centuries, and we all, unintentionally, contribute to its evolution in our innate drive towards mental acuity through elegant expression-- combined with our tongue's own tendency towards sloth!

B000002H33|5.0|If you asked somebody to think of ten heavy metal albums, regardless of the order or genre, there's a good chance one of them will be \\"Master of Puppets\\". Two decades ago, Metallica released this mammoth album, and it has definitely been a huge influence. Imagine all the bands that Metallica has influenced. To thrash metal, they did what The Ramones did to punk rock, or what Rush did to prog rock/metal, and this release shows it.  Their debut album had a very NWOBHM sound to it, adding some bluesy bar and punk influences, to sound almost like an American Motorhead. By the release of the second album, they had added more complex and progressive touches. And by this release, they had perfected their style of music.   Some people will say this is one of the best albums of all time. Others will say it's lacking in professional or proper songwriting, musicianship, etc. Still, even others will have mixed feelings about it. Listen to the album and judge for yourself. All the same, considering the monster riffs, lightning solos, battering drumming and overall use of the lyrics, given a grand, epic feel to the overall tone, and we have something that, to say the very least, you can't ignore.    \\"Battery\\" starts off with some dark, acoustic guitars, then has a quick power-metal styled riff before going into a simple but rapid guitar riff. A raging guitar solo comes in at the middle by none other than Kirk Hammett, and the climactic ending sets the perfect tone for a follow-up.  \\"Master of Puppets\\" has that epic, larger-than-life feel to it I was talking about. Legendary guitar riffing, a gentle, beautiful solo, and one of the coolest and most famous guitar solos following. Add an anti-drug meaning to it and the chanting of \\"Master! Master!\\", and you have one of the very best metal song of all time.  \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\": A progressive, six-and-a-half minute song about a sea monster in Europe. Acoustic guitars open the song, but the crushing riff that repeats throughout shows a mix of thrash, stoner metal, even proto-grunge to some extent. A slow and powerful song with an almost mythological tone to it.  \\"Sanitarium\\": An epic, ballad-turned-thrasher in the stylings of \\"One\\" and \\"Fade To Black\\", this one is just another Metallica classic. The mystical atmosphere of the balladic part adds a cool touch, and then turns to an epic headbanger towards the end.  \\"Disposable Heroes\\": This eight-minute, antiwar monster track combines sinister speeds, galloping guitar riffs and pounding drums into yet another great song, with a great chorus to add.  \\"Leper Messiah\\": Another great song that's overall a bit slower, and has a powerful guitar riff.  \\"Orion\\": The greatest heavy-metal instrumental ever written, no questions asked, this one is second to none. An epic intro, great, chugging, guitar riffs, beautiful soloing that combines shred and a Jimmy Page style, a timeless bassline, and an awesome ending. If there were ever an eight-and-a-half, instrumental, thrash verison of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", this would pretty much qualify.  \\"Damage Inc.\\": Has the best introduction of all the songs. The slow, melodic basswork gives yet another epic feel to the album, and then after about 75 seconds, the song explodes into a furious guitar riff and cannon drumming. Anthemic lyrics round out this underrated, speed-metal classic, and Kirk Hammett adds an amazing, forty-second plus guitar solo, one of my favorite of his, and certainly one of his best. The album ends on a speedy note, repeating the guitar riff used after the introduction.    There you have it, all eight songs of \\"Master of Puppets\\". Unfortunately, this would also be the last album with Cliff Lee Burton, may he rest in peace. So with all said, if you're into metal, you'll certainly consider this to be a gem among gems. Play it loud, feel its power and epic force. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B0009F9O08|4.0|Like another reviewer, this is the only Bowie album I ever owned. The reason, of course, is Earl Slick's soulful, screaming guitar. Listen to WIDTH of a CIRCLE, Slick's solo alone makes owning the album worthwhile.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I've been hooked on this show since it began, and I heartily recommend it to other ADULTS who enjoy dramas featuring complex and memorable characters.    Dexter is a cold, calculating serial killer.  He picks his victims, stalks them like a cat after a mouse, and subjects them to torture, murder and mutilation before dumping their remains in the waters off the shores of Miami.    Sounds like a monster, doesn't he?      But wait, there's a twist.  Dexter doesn't prey on decent, law-abiding people, and never, ever on children.    His targets are true human scum.  In the first episode we see him capture a priest, who has molested and killed several teenage boys.  Dexter forces the warped clergyman to drive him to a shack deep in the Florida woods.  There he has a surprise for the murderous pedophile: the bodies of his adolescent victims, which Dexter discovered buried in the nearby swamps.  The priest's victims glare at him with dead, rotting eyes, driving him mad and vastly intensifying the horror and pain he feels as Dexter carves him up like a turkey.     Dexter's day job is with the Miami police, for whom he works as a blood spatter expert (how do you get a job like that?).  Most of his co-workers accept him as completely normal, save one, an always suspicious detective with serious anger management issues who takes every chance he can to harass the hero/killer.      Dexter's sister is a cop on the Miami force.  She knows nothing of her brother's hobby.  His adoptive father, who is now deceased, did, however. It was he who first recognized Dexter's homicidal impulses, and persuaded him to direct them only against human vermin.  Dexter struggles to live within the code of honor which his dad taught him, as he satisfies his urge to kill.    Dexter's real parents are unknown, and his early childhood is shrouded in mystery.  Harry Morgan, the police officer who would adopt him, found him trapped in a blood-soaked trailer when the future vigilante was but a toddler.  Every so often we are given clues as to what the boy endured early in his life, hints of what made him the very sick person he is today.    So, what is Dexter: hero, monster, victim, or some bizarre combination of all three?  That is the question this series constantly asks as it follows the life of this darkly disturbing yet deeply fascinating character.  Along the way it raises age-old issues about the natures of  good and evil.      Is it right to do horrible things for the sake of a greater good?  You will ponder this question as you watch the show.       It's brooding darkness is lightened by well-placed moments of black humor, however, such as when Dexter's lady friend calls him on his cell just as he is tossing a body into the ocean.  \\"Just dropping somebody off\\" is his reply to her question about what he is up to.       Dexter walks a very thin line between good and evil, sanity and madness, and it is this constant tension which makes the character so irresistibly compelling to me.  The cast is superb, and the shows' production values   and scripts are excellent.  I give this program my very highest recommendation
B000001FUZ|3.0|From the ringing piano chords which open \\"Glad\\", to the keening Hammond organ of \\"Every Mother's Son,\\" a mood of joy, or optimism, pervades this album.  This is perhaps unique in the rock music of the time (late 60s and early 70s).  We are told by rock historians that the time was a glum one in the \\"counter-culture\\" (the dominant one, actually).  The \\"love era\\", typified by acts like the Byrds and the Beatles, was ending, to be supplanted by the gloomier, visceral sounds of glam, punk, and nascent heavy metal.      Steve Winwood and Traffic must not have gotten the bad news, as a celebratory mood pervades \\"John Barleycorn.\\"  The album's opener, \\"Glad,\\" is an energetic sax-and-piano workout (with Winwood playing bass and piano on the track).  The hero of \\"Freedom Rider,\\" who seems to echo Peter Fonda's \\"Captain America\\" from \\"Easy Rider,\\" is given a send-off that includes an extended solo for the Fender Rhodes.  \\"Empty Pages\\" has a similarly easy, jammy feel.      Another unique aspect of the album is the approach to the recording itself.  It has a very \\"natural\\" or \\"live\\" feel, as though the tracks are mostly one-offs.  Every instrument is given a detailed image in the sound-picture, warts and all.      The mood of the album begins to slow somewhat for \\"Stranger To Himself\\" and \\"John Barleycorn.\\"  \\"Stranger to Himself\\" is perhaps the weakest number on the album (of particular note would be the nervous, stumbling guitar solo), both musically and lyrically.  The latter song is a traditional English folk number, and rendered as soaring epic here -- Winwood's voice has rarely sounded clearer or better.    Rounding out the LP's second side is \\"Every Mother's Son\\", an extended modal jam on the Hammond organ framed by verses in a different key.  Of note is Winwood's layers of piano in the rhythm section -- the resultant sound is unique.      No other band of this genre (The Grateful Dead, Santana, Little Feat, Allmans) was quite as effective from a timbral standpoint.  Those other bands tend more to sound like one another than Traffic sounds like any of them.      There are perhaps two reasons for this -- Traffic's foregrounding of keyboard instruments above the normal electric guitar sound, and, in addition, its featuring of reeds.  This sort of arrangement was unheard of other than, say, something like King Crimson, which was a different sort of animal, altogether.
0143038583|5.0|Not only did I find this book incredibly informative and insightful, I found Pollan's style of writing effortless to read.    This book should be either compulsory reading in public high schools in America, or the key principles contained in it should be taught as a class.  I'm sure it would go a long way to reducing American obesity and Type 2 diabetes, both of which have reached epidemic proportions and do not bode well for this country's future.    Whilst I am neither pro carnivorism, nor pro vegetarianism (I believe this is a matter of personal choice), I do believe this book presents an eye-opening account of the price paid by this blue planet in order to feed Mankind.    I have read this book more than once, and each time through, something new makes an impression on me.  If you are an inhabitant of Earth, you owe it to yourself and the ground you stand on, to read this book.

B000VKJ6VS|4.0|Overall Alter Bridge's sound has remained the same, but there is just something about this disc that makes it better than \\"One Day Remains.\\" On ODR, I felt like it was still kind of Creed with a new singer. These songs have much more of an identity of a new band.     As always, Tremonti kills it on the guitar, but this time around the riffs seem to have more purpose and bring you in more. On the debut, you heard his skill, but it didn't always add to the track. These riffs are very \\"hooky\\".    Miles also fits in better on this record, which is probably due to the fact that he was involved in the songwriting process this time around.     I've only listened to the disc twice (as it just came out today), but I'm liking it a lot. Catchy riffs, good melodies, and overall just some really captivating songs. A job well done.
0061142026|3.0|[[ASIN:0061142026 Stardust]]\\"Stardust\\" by Neil Gaiman<br /><br />A small town Named Wall located in England is bordered by a....well, wall. This wall is the borderland between our world and the magical land of Faerie. Faerie can only be accessed by a small 6 foot gap in the wall but only every 9 years when the inhabitants of Faerie gather near the entrance for a market. At all other times the opening is guarded and no one is allowed to pass. In the town of Wall lives a young man named Tristan Thorn. One night Tristan decides to profess his love to a girl named Victoria. Upon professing his love they witness a star fall over the land of Faerie and Tristan tells Victoria that he will retrieve the fallen star for her in return for whatever he desires from her. Victoria agrees and Tristan enters Faerie in search of the fallen star......<br /><br />This book wasn't terrible but I can't call it great either. Something about the story just came across as very generic and very \\"Typical Fairy Tale\\" to me. The characters had a limited amount of development and just seemed a little bit like \\"Cut and paste\\" characters. Typical fairy tale characters which include the young naïve man going on a mission to prove his love, the evil old witch, and the damsel in distress amongst others. Like I said it wasn't terrible either it was just, well......a 3 to 3.5 out of 5.<br /><br />The Good: This was a quick and easy read and wasn't boring at any point.The story was well written overall. The characters and plot were interesting if a little under developed<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing terrible. The characters were a little under developed and the story seemed a little generic and just never quite grabbed me.<br /><br />Overall: Not a terrible read. Quick and entertaining worth picking up but don't expect greatness.
B000ROALCG|4.0|I really liked this CD. It has quite a few great salsa tracks. Great  band sound nice beats and full of energy.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|I was taken aback by the tone of this album.  In recent years, Bruce has given us Devils & Dust (a solid album, but more in the vein of Nebraska), and The Rising (a little on the redundant side, but who can really knock the subeject matter?).  Springsteen had gotten away from the straightforward rock tunes of The River and Born in the USA....well, no longer!    Bruce sounds as if he is being backed by Pearl Jam on this record.  Some have knocked the production of Brendan O'Brien, but he lends a sense of urgency to the album.  The first single, \\"Radio Nowhere\\", sees Bruce and the band rocking as if it were 1984.  Other standout tracks include \\"You'll Be Comin' Down\\" (which channels Roy Orbison) and \\"Long Walk Home,\\" but there are very few clunkers here.    This is easily Springsteen's best album in 20 years.  His politics are still present in the songs (for better or for worse), but they are not too overt (see: Eddie Vedder).  One reviewer compared this album stylistically to The River, and I would have to agree....and in terms of some of the other albums that Bruce has produced in recent years, that is a step in the right direction.

B000EQ4G5K|1.0|I really liked Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad CD. Not just the hit single Umbrella but the whole album, so I ordered a copy of her previous release, A Girl Like Me. I was disappointed, as the only good track on this one IS the hit single, SOS. A Girl Like Me has a less-urban feel, and is musically immature compared to her following release. It's not \\"bad\\" music really, but not what I had hoped for. OK really it is bad music except for SOS. While Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad is a pop masterpiece, A Girl Like Me is lackluster and just plain dull, lacking the hooks the vocals and the lyrical content that made her later album successful.
0385520298|4.0|Zhuang is 23 years old when she arrives in London to study English. She has a one-year student visa, is enrolled in an English language school, and has no idea how she will manage to function and exist in England. Since no one can pronounce her name, Zhuang goes by Z. Armed with her handy Concise Chinese-English Dictionary, she only hopes that she will manage to acclimate and learn in her new country.<br /><br />After finding a Chinese family to stay with, Z is at the movies alone when she meets the man who will change her life. Referred to only in the second-person, the man is 20 years her senior, but within a week she's moved in with him. Her companion is mysterious and the reader wonders about his motives, but our heroine falls deeper and deeper in love with him. Their relationship is the focus of this touching novel, along the effect it has on Z, her sense of self and individuality, and how it helps her to develop her identity.<br /><br />As an editor, it was difficult for me to read the first few chapters of this book even in spite of the author's note (Sorry of my English). The book is written as Z would speak, with her English getting better over the course of the story, the vocabularly getting broader, and an eventual grasp on English grammar being developed. It can be difficult to get used to, but once you absorb yourself in the story, the language is the least of your concerns.<br /><br />This story was amazingly well written and the characters reminded me of those from some of my favorite coming-of-age novels. Z, though 23, is a naive child when she arrives in England. Her parents are funding her education, she has no real plans for where she will live, and she bounces from hostel to apartment to live-in boyfriend with no thoughts about the repurcussions of her actions. Those faults, however, only made her more endearing and realistic to me. Z is lost when she arrives and when she meets her hero, referred to only as \\"you\\" throughout the book, she is finally found.<br /><br />The relationship between \\"you\\" and Z was the focus of much of this book, and one of my favorite parts. Since the story is told in the first person, the reader only sees their relationship through Z's eyes, but Guo does a great job of describing her companion so that the reader can imagine what he thinks about his communicatively challenged girlfriend and the demands she puts on him.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers, but I can understand how others wouldn't. It's not a book for everyone. It takes patience, and the ability to absorb yourself in the story without being bogged down by the language problems. If you allow yourself to immerse yourself in this touching and endearing novel, though, I don't think you'll be disappointed.nship between \\"you\\" and Z was the focus of much of this book, and one of my favorite parts.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|I've had this CD for just over two weeks now. Time to write a review. The first two times i listened to this CD i thought It was nothing special except for a few tracks Radio Nowhere being number one.But when i listened the next twelve times WITHOUT the Lyric sheet. I felt the true desperation in this album.I'll tell ya, Radio Nowhere is the London Calling of the 21'st century. In my own opinion. I've always believed that there are two kinds of cynicism, the first is the cynicism on the true nihilist those who really don't believe in anything,the ones who say O well Life is cruel and then you DIE.  Springsteen's cynicism is of the type that belongs to the people who TRULY have faith in Life. He knows thing's could BE better but maybe HE even fells helpless.This CD has musical influences that I can hear that range all the way from the Clash to the Beach Boys,with Healthy doses of Creedence Clearwater Revivial,and the Rolling Stones.By the way I'm not ragging on lyric sheets,Lyrics have always been as important as the music all my musical life, often times more so.Though it seems certain times that I need to listen to CD's without the lyric sheet for me to get the greatest overall effect. God bless lyric sheets though. This album requires a number of listenening times though to get to the Pearl inside the clam. And if you dought my assement of Springsteen's true optimism, please listen yo the track\\" I'll Work for Your Love.\\" and The track \\"Long Walk Home.\\" Thank You for your time, if you read this.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|After the relentless depression that was the cold and pale [[ASIN:B000089RVU Bare]], Annie Lennox re-embraced her inner-Diva and comes back breathing fire. This is the most umptempo album she has recorded since leaving the Eurythmics. She is also recording \\"big picture\\" types of songs again, a welcome respite from \\"Bare's\\" at times unbearable naked emotionalism. She's back to letting the sisters do it for themselves, as the terrific \\"Sing\\" and the ok \\"Womankind\\" show.<br /><br />I, for one, am thrilled she is no longer the despondent ice queen of her previous album. On the lead track, \\"Long Road,\\" Annie builds the song till it pile-drives any lingering doubts about her diva-hood away. Then \\"Love is Blind\\" pumps up a beat that recalls her best work with Dave Stewart. And for those who feel the elegance of [[ASIN:B000002VMH Diva]] might have fallen under producer Glen Ballard's Alanis Morissette popularizing, there is the terrific torch song closer \\"Fingernail Moon.\\" When Annie soulfully croons \\"you make the stars dissolve like sugar in my mouth,\\" you will realize that you've just sat through an up-front and foreground album. \\"Songs Of Mass Destruction\\" is not meant to be compliant background music. It may only be her fourth album as a solo artist, but really...it's the bomb.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Just wanna add my 5 stars to even out the clueless \\"critics\\" giving this excellent album a very bad rap.  This awesome cd bears repeated listening cuz it gets even better with more spins.  Every one of these songs is a masterpiece and it's great hearing the Boss return to the sound that made him famous, yet updating it with strings and his too seldom heard non-raspy singing voice on \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" and \\"Your Own Worst Enemy.\\"  \\"Radio Nowhere\\" smokes!  And, \\"Livin' In the Future?\\"  Well, listen to it for yourselves and it just might make you feel good.  There is not one song on this record that doesn't leave a good impression.  Well done, Bruce!
034544678X|5.0|This book was a truly great source if you are looking to understand the behavior of your dog better. It is not a training manual, but there are things that dog owners and potential dog owners can learn from the information in the book. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in dogs!
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This movie just makes you feel dirty. You leave it not liking a single character; some have said it's real life, but not my real life people. There is no reason to screw anyone over as terribly as was portrayed in this movie. Don't waste your time. I'm glad I checked it out for free from the library.
0140544518|5.0|Many think of the story \\"The three little pigs\\" as a worn out fairy tale. This book puts a new twist to the tale by adding a different point of view ... particularly from the WOLF's side. My children \\"howl\\" at the wolfs version of his mistreatment and being so misunderstood by the world. Opens ears of kids to listen to both sides and make up your mind as to what really happens..... my kids determined the wolf was full of it and the pigs in the end win out in their minds. Very funny book.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love this show.  After reading the book it is based on, I waited patiently for the video and it was well worth the wait.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|I can't beleive they want $19 for this peice. D12 is trash they shouldn't even be making records.
B000SFZ05C|3.0|I just recently have gotten into The Cult, and they are quickly becoming one of my favorite bands. So naturally when I heard they were releasing a new album I was excited. I couldn't wait to hear what they had in store for us. So I pop in the c.d. and what do I get, a band that sounds like there trying to be The Cult. Needless to say I was a little disappointed. But I stuck with it, Listening to it over and over, in hopes that I would start to like it. And you know what, I started to enjoy it. Not love it but it could have been worse. This is an ok album, not terrible but also not what it could and should have been.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|Excellent, love the show. Hope it lasts for years as did stargate sg-1. Reccomend all 3 seasons to own and watch.
0399208534|4.0|The book was in excellent condition, but we did not receive it until at least a week after all the other items we had ordered were received. They were all going to be mailed to our grandson, so it was a little frustrating to have to wait on this one item.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Alter Bridge does it again! If you loved their first album, then you will absolutely love this one, it is worth the price and you will not be disappointed.     Guitar soloing, meaningful lyrics, great vocals and super arrangements are what makes this album top notch. Miles Kennedy is great rock vocalist, unlike Scott Stapp who should just stay home.
B000I0QK74|4.0|the christmas album i've been waiting for, being a JT fan, especially because of his soft, characteristic voice and image (he may beat his children though, i don't know)
B000WLIEKK|5.0|It has been years since rock music has struck a cord in me like this.  Mark Tremonti's work on the guitar is \\"GOD LIKE\\".  You can feel his passion with every strum.  The whole band has matured and I wouldn't be surprised if this album outsells anything that Creed ever produced.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|This DVD is simply amazing. The sound quality is just insane. You can really tell the difference between a regular CD and 5.1 Dolby Digital DVD quality. The remastering job they did for this DVD is flawless. You can hear notes you wouldn't be able to hear on a CD. It sounds as if the band were playing right in front of you. This DVD is just perfect.
B000VPUIA6|2.0|I love the Beatles,  but I also love paying the rent.  I would have given more than two stars to the film, but unfortunately, I can't afford five.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Alterbridge is probably one of the best bands out today.  This album gives you a mixture of everything a rock fan could imagine.  Some of my favorite songs are Brand New Start, Blackbird, White Knuckles, and New Way To Live (bonus track at Best Buy).  This cd is perfect from start to finish and rocks you to the core.  I loved Creed but Alterbridge takes music to a another plateau.  Five stars!!!!!!!
B000V4UFZK|4.0|This is a great movie that has certainly held up over time.  That it's being re-mastered for this release is what counts.  The movie is why we buy these DVDs.  The extras are nice, too, half the time I don't even watch them, though.  But having a new print of this wonderful film for under ten bucks, sounds good to me.
038533348X|3.0|This was my first time reading Vonnegut, and I bought this novel largely based on his reputation as an author and the reviews I read here.  The premise of the novel also sounded interesting.  The narrator, Jonah, is writing a book about the events that took place on the day the atomic bomb was dropped, and focuses on the \\"father\\" of the atomic bomb, Felix Hoenikker, and his children.  He eventually finds himself on the fictional island of San Lorenzo amid the backdrop of political and religious instability.<br /><br />I could tell right away that Vonnegut was an excellent author. That is clear from his writing, which is very elegant and well organized.  The book is a short read at 300 pages, and with chapters at 1-2 pages long, most people will be through it in a few hours.  The chapters all flow into each other and there is no \\"jumping around\\" between other characters, as Jonah narrates the story through the first person.<br /><br />Those are the positives and the reason I gave Cat's Cradle three stars. I believe this is a good book and likely an intellectual commentary on society and the arms race, etc etc, however all of this must have gone completely over my head because I didn't see any of it.  Maybe this book is \\"too\\" intellectual for me, since I am not used to having to think so much while reading.  What's more, the satire also went over my head and I do not recall any humorous moments in the entire book, and kept looking for the plot.<br /><br />I do not mean for this review to turn people off of Cat's Cradle, just to let them know what they are getting into.  If your usual fare is Tom Clancy, Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, etc, and you are not used to writers like Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, Chuck Palahniuk (this book reminded me a LOT of [[ASIN:0385498721 Survivor: A Novel]]), you may find you are missing out on most of the actual book.  I was not disappointed when I finished Cat's Cradle, but I certainly wasn't as satiated as I usually am when I finish a good novel.  Caveat emptor..
0312370830|5.0|I could not put this book down. The story was beautifully written, though I wasn't crazy about the ending. I guess through so much tragedy, it was probably a better ending than the other possibilities. It had been a long time since reading a book that I was sad to see end, so that gets it 5 stars from me.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|This review refers specifically to the deluxe special edition 3-disc set of 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' (often appropriately shortened PATGOD). While it has long been established that this was one of the most important albums ever released (and for good reason!), this edition is by far the most essential CD version yet. Although I am very familiar with all the little aural details on this record (I thought), this CD release is still an eye-opener. For starters, it contains both the stereo and mono mixes of the entire album; and marks the first time that US consumers have a chance to hear the original mono mix. There are often subtle but important differences in stereo and mono mixdowns for 1960's-era albums, but this is usually of interest mostly to audiophiles and collectors. Not in this case though. For many of the tracks, the mono and stereo versions are very different. This seems to be especially the case for 'Interstellar Overdrive' where the 2 different mixes result in almost 2 entirely different versions. In fact, having never heard the mono mix, I was alarmed at first to hear some very discordant (but in a good way) keyboard notes along with the opening guitar salvo - in the stereo mix the guitar is entirely dominant, creating a very different audio effect. There are other key differences throughout as well. Likewise, 'Astronomy Domine' is also quite different (especially in the opening drum pattern), as are 'Matilda Mother' and 'Pow R Toc H'. Other tracks (e.g., 'Lucifer Sam') seem to be more similar. In any event, both mono and stereo discs are superbly mastered. Then there is the third (bonus) disc of extra material, including Syd-era singles (including B-sides) and a few alternate versions of album tracks. All of this extra stuff is stupendous, and adds depth and context to the album proper. My only quibble would be that there should have been more unusual material added to the bonus disc (which only clocks in at a pathetic 25 minutes), such as unreleased but completed songs like `Scream Thy Last Scream' and `Vegetable Man' as well as the early (unreleased) version of `Candy and a Currant Bun' (originally titled `Let's Roll Another One').  Nevertheless, this package easily earns 5+ stars. The art design and packaging are also extraordinary.
1592402690|5.0|I am about 50 pages from finishing this book, but one thing I want to point out is that Geoff Emerick does not fawn all over Paul at the expense of the other Beatles, as has been stated in previous reviews.  Most people I know have their favorite Beatle, and Mr. Emerick is no exception.  He makes it clear that Paul was always the most friendly and diplomatic of the four, and this coincides with what we already knew.  Whereas the other Beatles may have had a tendency to put up buffers around themselves, Paul tended to be the outgoing and friendly one, and I'm sure that was a comfort to Emerick, who was trying to fit in with the world's most popular pop recording group.  Just the same, and as proof of his objectivity, Emerick also points to the contributions made by Paul toward the overall friction that developed and led to the break-up of the Beatles.  Emerick also eventually has very positive things to say about Lennon and Harrison, and illustrates the bridges and appreciations that developed between him and them.  So, don't be put off by those reviews that criticize Emerick for being unduly biased.  If you have listened intently to Beatles recordings, many of your conclusions will be confirmed by what Geoff Emerick has to say in this book.  I think he did an amazing job, and if you are into uncovering new and interesting detail about the Beatles and how they worked in the studio, don't pass this one by.
1400063515|4.0|i read both books by mr. taleb (black swan and fooled by randomness) last week. i enjoyed both, although i think he made the point about the futility of inductive reasoning more persuasively in the randomness book. both argue the same point with different emphasis. in black swan, he even undertake a bit of advising, akin to list of things to do so that you don't get harmed by black swans.<br />often, but not for too long, i get exasperated by his desire to grind an ax: his constant put downs on economists, mba's and journalists. i can see his point that math has a lot to teach to those ignorant of subtle complexities of probability theories, but the pompous (but quite entertaining) name calling is just not necessary. having said that, he did toned down a bit in the black swan book, so if you prefer something more spicy, read the randomness book first.<br />mr taleb has done a good job at presenting an interesting hypothesis, i am waiting for his scholarly works to prove he is not just exercising litearary rights to fill his pocket the lazy way.<br />things to watch for: when he goes over how useless econmists are, he makes broad assumptions about the neo-classical econ approach. this shows that he is rather naive of this \\"soft\\" science. one point in case, there is this concept called opportunity cost, it matters when making rational decisions. he just ignored it or perhaps was not aware of its central role in how economics study the world. simlarly, we all know that models make assumptions, some are more extreme than others. they serve a purpose, benchmarking. no one expects to find a perfectly competitive market (i think there is one close to it, the commodity  market), but that is NOT the point.<br />in sum, highly enjoyable book. taleb is at his bests explaining intuitively statistics. does a good job in criticizing inductive reasoning, but a terrible job at justifying the put downs on economics.
B000RP4LEO|5.0|Five MARVELOUS Stars!! Brilliant French piano virtuoso H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Grimaud has conjured up highly enjoyable and individualistic interpretations of two awe-inspiring Ludwig Van Beethoven compositions: Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat major, Opus 73 (which fans have given the name \\"Emperor\\", but not by Beethoven himself); and the Piano Sonata No. 28 in A major, Opus 101: which Beethoven called \\"a series of impressions and reveries\\". Widely known for her thoughtful and personal interpretations of the classical master composers, Ms Grimaud has continued to widen her overall repertoire and, in this case, to deepen her personal Beethoven performance treasury.  It is also said the extraordinary Ms Grimaud has a natural form of the condition called synesthesia: in her case she actually experiences music as colors and maybe that's the special quality we are hearing in her wonderful interpretations which have so much verve and flare. Ms Grimaud is wonderfully supported by the splendid Staatskapelle Dresden Orchestra under the baton of Vladimir Jurowski for Opus 73. Here, Ms Grimaud shows herself to be a very thoughtful yet powerful, philosophical, and deeply individualistic performer who gives the listener a new viewpoint of Beethoven's astounding creations.<br /><br />Both performances of these masterworks are 'Pieces De Resistance', but of special note to me is Ms Grimaud's stupendous reading of \\"Emperor\\"s Allegro movement with soaring, empathetic support from the Staatskapelle Dresden.  Then there is the poetic reading of the second and third movements: the Adagio un poco mosso and the elegant and joyous Rondo. I DO \\"hear thoughts, reflections, and ideas\\" delivered in what she calls a \\"contemporary\\" version of \\"Emperor\\". My favorite version of \\"Emperor\\" remains that of the legendary Guiomar Novaes and the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra under Jonel Perlea in the 1950s, but this is a most impressive and individualistic reading by Ms Grimaud. That's also certainly true of the four movement Opus 101 where Ms Grimaud unleashes new textures and dynamism in her version, especially in the impressive flow and exposition of movement IV (Geschwind). Decades into her brilliant career, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Grimaud continues to deliver stunning, thoughtful interpretations of the classics, as exemplified by this excellent recording. Kudos to Vladimir Jurowsk and the Staatskapelle Dresden Orchestra. The recording is clear and crisp. My Highest Recommendation.

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|This is the most amazing CD I've heard in years. Annnie's voice is so melodic and captivating that it draws you in and touches your soul. The \\"Dark Road\\" drew me in and has kept hold of me ever since. Reccomend this to everyone you know.
0553805460|1.0|A story about a low-class boy from Queens who dreams of becoming \\"Master of the Universe\\"?    Who is Jordan Belfort anyway?  The only thing known to be said about him is that he was diagnosed with traces of dwarfism at birth.  Maybe this is why he complains countless times in this book about the fact that his ex-wife constantly refers to him as \\"her little baby\\" or more so...\\"a little peice of s#@t\\". This author delivers one message to the reader, and that would be one of insecurity. Maybe this is why he chooses to personally insult everyone he mentions in this story, even his \\"best friends\\".. This guy is pathetic! His tales of fantasy, living high on the hog could only have been doctored up due to extensive drug abuse.  No one really knows who this guy is and quite frankly...who cares.  This book is boring, Jordan Belfort is boring.

B00005JPLW|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how many great films of our time get pushed by the wayside by people and torn down for being \\"original\\" and actually interesting. I've read so many scathing reviews about this movie on all this site's forums and it pains me to hear it. I've read reviews like \\"The world would be a better place if this movie had never been made.\\" Which clearly state to me that many people obviously do not have the stomach for great films. They would rather sit back in their cozy little hovels and watch films that would make anyone who has a decent head on their shoulders go mad with the absurd stupidity of so many third-rate movies these days. To anyone who may be a fan of these such movies...do everyone in the world a favor and just destroy your computers now. Lest we be forced to listen to more incessant bickering from third-rate society members.<br /><br />The film adaptation of Frank Miller's \\"300\\" is a compelling and graphic rendition of the battle of Thermopylae Pass. A cornerstone of military doctrine for more than 2500 years. A clear reminder of how skill, tactics, and the concept of fighting for freedom are more powerful than even the largest and mightiest foes. Read your history for a change instead of the latest \\"Brad, Jen, and Angelina weekly whine-fest\\". (Seriously...nobody cares.)<br /><br />Now I will admit that yes, this is anything but fact. This is Hollywood fiction based on a few key facts. Not anything to be taken as absolute. However for what its worth this movie delivers not only an impressive cast that well portray the brutality and viciousness of bronze-age combat, but also a visual feast of action and adventure. Remember that this film was shot entirely on green-screen and then later rendered into the environment of Greece's terrain. Admittedly this is a very surprising move to make and it was exceptionally well pulled off. This could very well be a herald of what we can expect in not too distant future films.<br /><br />Sure, there was sex, blood, violence, and nudity...If that's the only reason anyone went to see this movie then I worry for the future of mankind. This film demonstrates the power that a great plot can put to any film.<br /><br />Hands down this is an absolute must-have movie.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|There aren't many film's that are better than the book (or short story...or novella) that they are based on, but The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely one that could actually be better than it's pulp predecessor.<br /><br />Back in 1982 Stephen King released a compilation of novellas under the title Different Seasons [[ASIN:0451167538 Different Seasons (Signet)]]. And two of the best King movie adaptations EVER came out of that book: Stand By Me in 1986 [[ASIN:B00003CXIP Stand By Me (Special Edition)]] and The Shawshank Redemption in 1994.<br /><br />But what inspired me today to write a review about a 13 year old movie? Well...three things actually:<br /><br />1) I saw a customer review on Amazon today calling the 2006 video game adaptation-film Silent Hill [[ASIN:B000GCFO0I Silent Hill]] \\"visionary\\" and ranking it 5 stars. I tried to think of movies that were 5 star movies in my book; there aren't many (relatively), and Silent Hill is far from 5 stars in my book. So, I was inspired to find a movie to write about that truly made the cut.<br /><br />2) I wrote a review today for the 2007 film adaptation of King's short story 1408 (see [[ASIN:B000UNYJLS 1408 (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] & [[ASIN:0743457358 Everything's Eventual : 14 Dark Tales]] ). But 1408 was also far from 5 stars in my book, so I was looking for redemption in the way of something better to write about.<br /><br />3) And finally, I saw an ad today for the late 2007 release of The Mist, another film adaptation of a King short story this time from 1985's Skeleton Crew [[ASIN:0451168615 Skeleton Crew (Signet)]]. But what's really interesting is that the director of The Mist is the same guy that directed The Shawshank Redemption...Frank Darabont...so my expectations for The Mist are very high! (Darabont also directed King's The Green Mile [[ASIN:B000HEWEDU The Green Mile (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].)<br /><br />So back to Shawshank. This movie was terrific...one of the top 5 I've ever seen. It kept all of the most impressionable book scenes entirely intact. And keep in mind that this was a Stephen King novella, so there's some pretty interesting stuff (you can count on King to wow you with precise tales that include plenty of thrills...and when he doesn't thrill you he goes for the gross-out!).<br /><br />Importantly, Shawshank really captured the bonds of friendship so perfectly created in King's novella. The Shawshank Redemption was a moving, realistic portrayal of a day in the prison-life of a wrongly convicted man; the movie really is the novella come to life.<br /><br />Kudos to Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman for exact incarnations of the characters in King's story; kudos to Darabont for his direction; and kudos to all for putting their hearts into the roles to create a show that not only entertains, but evokes emotional reminisces in viewers that grew up in a very different world from today.<br /><br />The Shawshank Redemption is truly worthy of it's 5 stars here at Amazon, and it should be added to your collection.tirely intact.

B000RJO578|5.0|If I was asked to sum up this movie in one sentence... \\"An interesting mix of suspense, action, hysterical comedy, and a slew of oddball characters.\\" would be my response.<br /><br />The film starts off in the same spastic and fast-forward A.D.D. style that the trio of Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, and Edgar Wright forged with their first parody-comedy \\"Shaun of the Dead\\". (Another comedy-Gem that is well worth watching, many times over.) Though this movie seems to move at a much slower pace than \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" it still retains the absurd comedy of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg on screen. Both actors make this film move and they really fill the screen with their antics. The pop-culture references are just as prevalent in this film as its predecessor and still just as hilarious. Old and recent movies are also a big part in the film's plot-line such as references to \\"Point Break\\" and \\"Bad Boys II\\". This film is based a lot on symbolism, so keep your eyes out for it. (This saves my fingers a bit and leaves the reader/viewer to look for themselves.)<br /><br />I must admit though that even for someone like me who isn't bothered by film/media violence the movie did catch me somewhat off guard. This movie is graphic and in at least one place that I can say it actually even my stomach roll slightly. (Anyone who has seen the film can probably guess which I refer to.)<br /><br />The last half hour of the movie is the huge old-west-meets-cop-action -shootout-with-comedy-mix-gun-battle. This is the part the whole movie builds up to. It's the absolute end-all-be-all of comedy action shootouts. Some of the weapons the villiagers use look like they were left over from World War II if not earlier. One villager even pulls out a Sten submachine gun, which was one big surprise to me.<br /><br />Above all else...this movie is another must-have for the movie collection.

034547581X|3.0|This book, while very popular and included on the US Army Chief of Staff's \\"Professional Reading List, is a mixed bag.  There's lots of action, shooting, firefights, etc., and Col. Moore did get some of the NVA perspective as well.  The maps are pretty good, and are useful to consult while reading this.  After reading this book, I came away with a feeling of awe and near disbelief about what these very young soldiers had to go through, what they endured, and how many were killed.  The problem, however, is that after awhile, the book reads like one non-stop chronicle of firefights and NVA assaults.  There is not enough structural framework to the narrative once the battle starts.  If the fighting was confusing to the GI's in the jungle where the battle was fought, how much more so to the reader 40 years later, not having seen the ground.  The book suffers from what many do, especially by 1st time authors--it keeps EVERYTHING in, and leaves nothing out.  The book could have used some editing of the repletion, and needs to have a much better organization of events.  I kept asking myself, \\"why are the soldiers there?\\"  \\"Why did they send in such a small force, and not reinforce in greater #'s?\\"  Moore never really provides this.
0345494997|2.0|Willie Stark.  Charles Foster Kane.  Shaw and Morgan.    These enduring fictional characters from three classic works of American literature and film have given people more insight into the characters of Huey Long, William Randolph Hearst, and Leopold and Loeb than any biography or history ever could.    In choosing to fictionalize their stories of historical figures, Robert Penn Warren (All The King's Men), Orson Welles (Citizen Kane) and Alfred Hitchcock (Rope) were able to engage in extensive studies of motivation and character development without being mired down by the narrative limitations of a straightforward historical account.  By choosing this technique, Warren, Welles and Hitchcock each created a masterpiece of aesthetic truth even if the historical facts were not quite as described in those works.    Not so Nancy Horan.  Her overly-hyped first novel, Loving Frank, is a flat, dry recitation of the story of architect Frank Lloyd Wright's seven-year affair with Mamah Borthwick and of their house, Taliesin, in Wisconsin.  Meticulously researched - I would say over-researched - the book is little more than a chronological account of the basic facts of the relationship from its beginnings in 1904 until its tragic end in 1914.    Totally absent from the book is any insight into the characters of Mamah or Frank.   Horan is either unwilling or unable to let us learn about her characters other than through continuous exposition - we know that Mamah is a bored, intellectual woman, trapped in a dull marriage totally at variance  with her radical ideas about love and marriage only because Horan tells us so.  It is a hallmark of good writing when the author can help the reader gain such insights organically, by engaging with the writing, instead of having them spoon-fed as Horan does.  Similarly, we learn about the salacious news coverage of the affair because Horan quotes the newspaper articles verbatim at great length.  There is nothing at all creative about Horan'stoo extensive quotation of primary sources.   And at 350 pages, Loving Frank's endless virtually identical descriptions of blue skies, colorful flowers and the aesthetics of architecture become tedious.  After Mamah runs off with Frank in 1907, there are no major plot developments until the end, and what plot developments there are have a wearying sameness to them; nothing of significance changes and there are no character epiphanies.  Even Mamah's relationship with Swedish feminist Ellen Key replicates her relationship with Frank.  Key engages Mamah to translate her works for an American audience and then proves, like Wright, to be fast and loose in her interpretation of her commitments to people.    Also, for a novel about a torrid love affair there is almost no eroticism to the story.  It is easy enough to understand why a woman like Mamah would be charmed into a brief affair with an eccentric genius such as Wright.  But seven years with a pompous, arrogant liar, long after she has seen him for what he was?  Of course such relationships exist, but fiction should at least try to explain why people behave this way.      The closest Horan comes to analyzing Mamah's motivation occurs towards the end.  Appalled that Frank has once again indulged his obsession to recklessly spend money (in this case, to completely furnish Taliesin, including purchasing not one, not two, but three baby grand pianos), while stiffing his workers on their wages, Mamah leaves him and goes to Chicago.  She swears she won't return until he changes.  Within days, he appears on her doorstep and apologizes.  She returns to him although there is no evidence he has reformed and in fact, he hasn't.  Once again, her return is explained entirely by the historical narrative - she must return because the story is about to end.        DISCLAIMER:  For those who are fussy about such things, I am about to tell you the ending.  Ordinarily, I would not do this in a review of a work of fiction.  But Horan sticks so closely to the historical record that you can learn the end of this story just by reading the Frank Lloyd Wright entry on Wikipedia. Indeed, since the ending is a matter of historical record, it would have made more sense to have told the story in flashback.  Anyway, given that the ending isn't a surprise, I feel no compunction about discussing it.  On the other hand, the ending illustrates both the central weakness of Horan's chosen technique and, ironically, suggests a much better architecture - this is a book about Frank Lloyd Wright, after all - for her narrative.    First, this novel utterly lacks a dramatic climax.  Given Horan's approach to the material, there is no dramatic tension involving Mamah and Frank to resolve.  Rather, the novel simply ends because of the homicidal intervention of a madman.  A mentally unstable worker, Julian Carlton, becomes unhinged after several altercations with his fellow workers that culminate in Mamah's dismissing him while Frank is away.  He murders Mamah, her two children, and five co-workers with an ax and sets fire to the residential wing of Taliesin.  While historically accurate, this ending in a work that purports to be fiction is in the nature of a dues ex machina.     Also, until Mamah's death, the novel is written from her perspective.  Once she is dead, the perspective shifts to Frank.  While a shift in perspective is a perfectly valid  writing technique, it should result in - well, a change in perspective.  That is after all, the whole point.  But shifting the perspective to Frank in this novel is merely a necessary device to finish the book; to flesh out the details of the crime, to describe the crafting of the coffins and the funerals, to set forth - again by the verbatim recitation of an actual letter Frank wrote to the editor of the local paper - Frank's reaction to Mamah's death, and finally, to announce Frank's intention to rebuild Taliesin.  We learn nothing more about Mamah, Frank or their relationship from Frank's viewpoint than we knew from Mamah's, because in reality, Horan has not told this story from either perspective.  She has told it entirely from an historical timeline.    Ironically, the murders suggest an architecture for this story that could truly have enabled the material to soar.  Julian Carlton was a madman; Frank Lloyd Wright was a genius.  The two are not that far apart; when you read the details of the murder, you realize Carlton was quite intelligent and carefully planned how to attack eight adults without being subdued.  How much more interesting this story would have been if told from the perspective of a fictional Julian Carlton.  Horan would probably object that the real Carlton worked only briefly for Wright and would not be familiar with the Mamah-Frank relationship.  But that is the beauty of fiction.  Had Horan chosen to fictionalize the story, there would have been nothing to stop her from making the \\"Carlton\\" character a long-time Wright employee.    Frank Lloyd Wright rebuilt Taliesin.  For over thirty years until his death in 1959, he lived there with his third wife, the dancer Olgivanna.  Together, they established an eclectic artistic community.  I would hope that whatever author writes a novel about Wright's relationship with Olgivanna - a relationship that seems more intrinsically interesting than his relationship with Mamah - will emulate Warren, Welles and Hitchcock in writing that story as a work of fiction, and not as a slavishily literal  historical novel.

0765315246|5.0|Old Man's War (2005) is the first novel in a new series.  Sometime in the future, the Colonial Union controls access to the colonies.  Some Earth citizens -- mostly losers in the Subcontinent War -- are allowed to migrate at any time.  The rest are restricted to signing up for the Colonial Defense Forces at age seventy-five.  Either way, only CU officials are allowed to return to Earth, so none really knows what happens to the recruits.    The colonies were originally surveyed and settled by Earth using the skip drive.  Somehow the colonies gained technological advances that they did not share with the home planet.  The outward symbol of this is the Nairobi beanstalk, which is neither economically feasible for any nation on Earth nor technology possible within their knowledge base.    In this novel, John Perry makes his final visit to the CDF recruiting station to complete the paperwork and receive his tickets.  Since his wife died almost eight years before, John had severed all his ties on Earth to prepare for this event.  Now he is ready and even eager to leave.    Leon Deak is also reporting for duty at Colonial Station.  Leon has attached himself to John in Chicago and is clinging to him like a leech.  Leon is a bigot and proves it every time he speaks.  He doesn't like blacks or tans and has a special aversion to the colonists who are migrating outward.  John thought that he had escaped the man by taking the early beanstalk shuttle, but Leon is also aboard.    Jesse Gonzales is another CDF recruit who happens to be Leon's next victim after John temporarily avoids the man.  John joins their argument by disagreeing with Leon.  Then John and Jesse manage to convince Leon that they are hopelessly liberal.    After Leon abandons them, John and Jesse are joined by Harry Wilson, a former physics teacher.  Before teaching, he had worked in the civil engineering department at General Electric.  He has some interesting things to say about the beanstalk.    After the beanstalk shuttle reaches Colonial Station, the recruits are met by two CU apparatchiks who poke and prod them along to the space shuttle that will take them to the CDFS Henry Hudson.  The recruits pass colonists and even aliens on their way through the station.  Once they pass a Gehaar eating chicken wings and Harry almost has to be dragged away from the alien.    In this story, the recruits are taken directly  to the mess hall aboard the Henry Hudson, where they are invited to eat donuts and drink coffee.  They are gradually joined by more than a thousand others who have arrived earlier.  After a long while, a Colonial Union diplomat greets them and provides an initial briefing.    After the briefing, John discovers that his bunkmate is Leon.  The next morning, he tries to wake Leon for breakfast, but is told to leave him alone.  In the mess hall, John meets Thomas Jane, Susan Reardon and Alan Rosenthal.  When he returns to his cabin, he finds Leon dead in his bunk from a heart attack.    After this excitement, John reports for his physical examination.  The physician encases him in a creche -- an all encompassing container -- and examines the findings.  Except for a minor testicular cancer, John is in good health for his age.  Then the doctor places a cuplike attachment to his head and the pain starts.    When John returns to his messmates, he -- and they -- are wearing a dusty speckled gray field of twenty thousand sensors embedded in the skull.  Then they are put through some very strange tests.  They only discover the purpose of these tests when they receive their new bodies.    This story tells of John's subsequent training and experiences as an infantryman in the CDF.  It seems that most of the other spacefaring species are not very passive.  Some even like to serve man . . . for dinner.    John almost dies in during a landing, but is rebuilt back at the base.  However, he has one memory that haunts him:  hearing the voice of Kathy, his late wife.  Later, he discovers his rescuer and finds her wearing Kathy's body, but with a different personality.    This tale presents a convincing case for individual combat in limited wars.  Nonetheless, the author has loaded the dice against wars of mass destruction.  The more advanced species apparently are not interested in sheer destruction, but limit combat to individual weapons.  One species -- the Consu -- seems to have incorporated individual combat into their religion.    This work has much in common with Heinlein's [[ASIN:0441014100 Starship Troopers]].  However, Heinlein included weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear and chemical -- within his work.  Also, the individual protection in this story is much less effective than Heinlein's armored suits.  Naturally, Heinlein's troopers were not old people.  And his troopers were unmodified humans.    Highly recommended for Heinlein fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of armed combat, geriatric mindsets, and a very unusual romance.    -Arthur W. Jordin
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Rock & Roll has RETURNED!  ALL HAIL ALTER BRIDGE!!!  Finally, TRUE music made by TRUE musicians has returned.  Now, would someone PLEASE remove all the crap that's littering the airwaves?    This sophomore effort from Alter Bridge is more like a doctoral dissertation.  In short, this album is nearly perfect.  From the first track to the last----NO FILLER!  The opening is like a punch in the face.  And, if you like energy, well, huh, um, you've come to the right place.  Blackbird is packed with the emotion that has been sadly missing from music for a long time.      Blackbird also contains the amount of energy that can only be compared with a grenade----with the pin pulled----thrown into a CASE of grenades----riding shotgun in a fully loaded fuel truck----driven straight into a nitro glycerin plant!!!    The track \\"Rise Today\\" has already been slated by CBS to appear as promotional use for SCI: Miami, as well as by the WWE for upcoming wrestling events.  (This was decided before the album was even released.)  \\"Rise Today\\" in incredible, but its definitely not alone on this album.  (In fact, there are too many good hooks to mention in a review.)  Also worthy to note is the very Led Zeppelin-like \\"Watch Over You\\", which you will get from the first note.  All in all, the band's influences are obvious throughout this album.      Also, even though One Day Remains was, and is, a great album----you can definitely tell that lead vocalist Myles Kennedy had a hand in the songwriting for Blackbird.  Not to mention, Alter Bridge enlists the guitar chops of Kennedy (which are huge) for this album; and, lead guitarist Mark Tremonti appears to not have any problem sharing the workload with Kennedy.    In short, Blackbird is beauty, brains, and tremendous amounts of brawn.  You know, music that makes the hair on your arm stand up, and makes you want to sing and shout at the top of your lungs?  That's Blackbird, and that's Alter Bridge.

1590171993|4.0|I read the lush praise of STONER in the NYRB and worried that it would not live up to the hype.  Perhaps, as one reader said, it has to do with my age, but I found the final pages so moving I had to stop and dry my eyes -- and it wasn't because of any cheap sentimental literary tricks but because experience and language had been made inseperable by Williams.      Despite my frustrations with the title character, and my impatience at times with Williams's refusal to give me more insight into how Stoner came to be gripped by literature (please, a few scenes describing his reading, or some lively talk with friends about a poem or other work they dug), and despite the sometimes awkward insertions about historical events, I found this novel stunning and moving in ways that made me feel grateful. And yes, as one reader commented, the love affair is brilliantly rendered.  (I had just reread A FAREWELL TO ARMS  and was struck this time by how juvenile it is and how inept Hemingway was in this novel when it came to showing adult love and affection.  Williams's character, also a \\"Katherine\\" is so deftly portrayed, and their relationship so brilliantly understood by Williams that, again, you can only be thankful and wish writers today could learn from his example.)

I know that to rest means death;      Death, but then what does death mean?--ease from a world of strife.  Life has been none too pleasant; yet with my failing breath      Still and still must I struggle, fight for the gift of life.

Charlie Cox my first movie that I can remember seeing him in, which he did a fantastic job for this role. Claire Danes couldn't have done better. Im beginning to get a soft spot for her in movies, just a wonderful actress. Robert DeNiro, does not mess up here and is as humerous as ever.

Halo is easily the best song - a masterpiece of arrangement, heavy guitars, angry lyrics, melodies and thunderous drumming. But this song is a microcosm of the entire CD. Every song here is amazing. And the CD is bookended by two 10+ minute songs that open and close the CD on high notes.<br /><br />As a new fan, it's hard for me to compare it with any of Machine Head's other work, but it's hard for me to imagine that any of it is better than this. Other reviewers seem to think this is the album they'll be remembered by. I can't help but agree.

First of all, her French is pretty much impeccable, but even more impressive is her voice...now a deeper, richer tone, smoky and worldly.  Not unlike the transformation of Marianne Faithful from pop lightweight to soulful, strident, sophisticated story-teller with her songs, Belinda brings a marvelously knowing style to these classic French pop songs.  And even that tremulous vibrato that's become a signature with her imitators and impersonators, here is more controlled, and seems perfectly placed for effect in interpreting these songs, some of which are highly emotional expressions of love and loss, others bright and uptempo with blissfully eclectic styles and instrumentation.  All in all, SUPERBE!

B000002KHF|5.0|Van Morrison's Moondance (1970) is quite simply, a classic. The songs, the sound, the lyrics. All classic. The album jumps right out of the gates with And It Stoned Me, Moondance, Crazy Love, Caravan, and Into The Mystic. These five songs are all rock classics by any standard. Come Running and These Dreams Of You are not quite on the same level, but still excellant songs and very enjoyable. The underrated and gospel-influenced Brand New Day probably should be a classic, too, as it is very good, and the heartfelt inspirational performance really hits home. The musical arrangements of the songs are a balanced blend of a very well played acoustic guitar, a humble horn section, and Van's soulful, laid-back vocals. The theme and sound are uncomplicated, poetic, and autumnal. In Moondance, Van sings:<br /><br />A fantabulous night to make romance,<br />Neath the cover of October skies.<br />And all the leaves on the trees are falling,<br />To the sound of the breezes that blow.

When I was at Antietam one of the eye-witness quotes was: \\"Bodies filled the entire field with every imaginable wound.\\" I was so overwhelmed tears flowed from my eyes.<br /><br />Why do I bring all this up? I just want you to know how INTO the Civil War I was (and still am, to a lesser degree), not just on an intellectual level, but an emotional one as well.<br /><br />So in December 1993 my then-fiance and I went to the theater to see the over-four-hour-long \\"Gettysburg\\" with much interest. All I can say is it was VERY DIFFICULT to sit through this entire film in one sitting.<br /><br />\\"Gettysburg\\" has a lot going for it: an all-star cast, including Tom Berenger (Longstreat), Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain) and Sam Elliott (Buford); great authentic Gettysburg locations; good battle scenes; a commitment to historical accuracy; and thousands upon thousands of Civil War reenactors.<br /><br />The subjects of the Civil War and Gettysburg are immensely interesting. You would think, therefore, that \\"Gettysburg\\" would be overflowing with life, but that's hardly the case. It takes FOREVER for things to get going. Plus there's an undeniably lazy and unexciting feel to the settings and dialogue when the forces aren't actually fighting. One has to REALLY CONCENTRATE to listen to and get through the interminable dialogue. Plus the mawkish melodrama factor is high.<br /><br />Part I is highlighted by Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top and his mad bayonet charge while Part II ends with the South's infamous Pickett's Charge. Both of these sequences are great and they give the viewer a good feel of what it must have really been like, which is one of the reasons I enjoy seeing historical films.<br /><br />The score is only half good. You'll definitely hear spots of brilliance but way too often it's sickeningly ultra-\\"heroic\\" or melodramatic.<br /><br />One aspect I liked was seeing the officers and soldiers pray while standing in line right before significant engagements. Yeah, it's hard to be an atheist when you're about to walk straight into friggin' cannon fire.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: There's a lot to respect about \\"Gettysburg.\\" It's a story about war and the men who engage in it, pure and simple. There's no female cast members, no forced romances. Unfortunately it's bloated, melodramatic and just plain lazy. Trust me, the REAL Gettysburg battle was anything BUT lazy and uninteresting. Still, if I concentrate hard to pay attention to the dialogue and non-action events in the film, I get a lot out of it. In other words, if you're braced for its shortcomings it's worth owning or renting. I'm glad I own it. But don't expect something great like, say, \\"Glory.\\"<br /><br />The battle of Gettysburg took place July 1-3, 1863 and was a huge victory for the North, the turning point of the war, in fact (along with Grant's simultaneous siege of Vicksburg). After the failure of Pickett's Charge, General Lee and his troops retreated back to their own territory. The war would go on for another two long years (almost) as the Confederates continued to put up an incredible and courageous fight, but the odds were against them. Gettysburg and Vicksburg were the seeds of their impending doom.<br /><br />General Meade congratulated his men for driving the Confederate invaders from the North's turf. But President Lincoln was upset because he wanted Meade to DESTROY Lee's army, not allow them to safely retreat back to their Southern sanctuary. Lincoln groaned: \\" 'Drive the invader from our soil'? My God! is that all?\\"<br /><br />Four months after the battle of Gettysburg, on November 19th, Lincoln  came to the small town and gave his potent 'Gettysburg Address' to honor the fallen soldiers and motivate continued Northern commitment and victory. So many people died at Gettysburg they were STILL burying the dead (!!).inued Northern commitment and victory. So many people died at Gettysburg they were STILL burying the dead (!!).
B000J4QWNQ|5.0|What's wrong with all the critics? Always comparing to that 80's show. Sure the movie has the same title, pastel colors here and there. But it's different, it's really good.   Time moved on guys.   This is the third time I watched the movie. It is a Michael Mann film, meaning it's perfect. Terrific script, great action, beautiful music, wonderful acting, perfect frames.  Just don't start comparing. Trust Michael Mann's professionalism. After all he's done Collateral, Heat, etc.etc. (and of course produced the original series) He knows what he's doing.  Both Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx do a great job. I have to admit I was never a real fan of the series. It was too much of a show, too entertaining for my taste. Crime and crime solving was as much fun as sipping rum by the pool watching the bikinis show off. I think that's wrong. Crime is wrong, dark and dirty. Going undercover, trying to stop things from getting worse is one of the most dangerous professions on earth, deserving our utmost respect. That's what needs to be transmitted. Michael Mann does a great job here. O.k., it's fiction and stylish, nothing like The Corner, but it's soooo good. Keeps you on the edge of your seat for the full 140 minutes.  The story is not very complicated. An undercover drug deal goes wrong. Crockett and Tubbs decide to take over and finish off the bad guys. It takes them about two hours. Don't worry, it's a wild ride, and they need every minute of it. Colin is ever as slick as Don Johnson - a much better voice! Jamie is much tougher than Philip Michael Thomas and it's good that he is. After all, as I said, this is not a pool party, this is a very dark story on an undercover job to stop one of the baddest Columbians around. There is a second storyline, Colin falling in love with the top gangster's wife. It's convincing and Colin does a great job in showing his doubts about his choices - even in the close-ups.   On the HD DVD transfer. It's extremely good. I've watched it with a friend on a huge screen. The speedboats almost spat the salty ocean water into my face. Very impressive! Get it!
B000LC55F2|5.0|The tagline on the movie says that once you see it you will want to immediately see it again.  That is true.  This is a must see a minimum of two times and is very entertaining.
0060755598|2.0|I think that it should not have been the author that was reading. He reads on a monotone level and makes it difficult to follow or not fall asleep.<br /><br />The book could also have been half the size that it was. The message is simple and that is build a system that you can duplicate.
0307341550|5.0|I like the style of this writer and the matter-of-fact way that she unravels a mesmerizing story. This isn't a long book, which is probably good because nothing else will get done until you finish it.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Great film that penetrates the thinkers and artists alike, a dark film that many find leaves them feeling bad yet wanting to watch it again.  Most of us have, many times.
0061122416|4.0|In \\"The Alchemist\\" I thought the author's fable about the shepherd boy, Santiago, and his travels were an interesting story. I loved every second of Santiago's search for his treasure by the pyramids and his journey through the desert. The book gave a wonderful insight into a person that is seeking their own destiny and learning from that pursuit. I did have a hard time connecting with the character Fatima. Maybe it was her fate, but I was hoping she would do more that sit around and wait for his return. Overall, Paulo Coelho prose is delightful, and inspirational and direct.
0307350444|5.0|un muy buen libro .  te mantiene en suspenzo queriendo saber que va a suceder, no pude parar de leer hasta terminarlo.
B000BRBA8S|4.0|Simple the best original sound track, performed by Shigeru Umebayashi.<br />But, to understand clearly the film, it's necessary to review the preview 'pelicula'of the director WKW, in the Mood for Love.
B00005JO9J|2.0|First of all, I was very disappointed in the length of the series for the season.  I knew the price was right, but didn't realize it only had a few cd's for the entire series.  Also, after watching season two first, season one did not particularly impress me.
B000RZIGUY|4.0|We already know this is a great action film with superb performances from both Travolta and Cage so I will just comment on the features:    Featurettes includes a decent amount information on all aspects of the script development, making of, locations, casting, set designs, special effects, weapons and the 'mimic' acting strategies for Cage/Travlota playing each other.  Also includes 7 deleted scenes, a biography-type feature covering the life and career of director John Woo, and the original theatrical trailer.      The greatest disappointment here is that while several cast/crew members appear in newly filmed interviews, both Travolta and Cage participate only by way of vintage interviews filmed back when the movie was actually being made.  You would think they would have been proud enough of this great film to come back to document it for posterity sake...    This DVD is probably worth the upgrade for fans, especially if you can manage to get a few bucks for your old copy.
B000092ZYX|5.0|well, i just finished listening to In Rainbows, the new Radiohead album, which i must warn you, it is absolutely breathtaking. But just like when i buy new shoes, i love to walk out of the store wearing my old ones; because they have been with me for a while, because they know me and i know them.  I guess that's why i'm here, telling you that you must take the time to listen to the magic on this album. It seems like it is blasphemous to dethrown Ok computer as their best album ever, and even though i can't deny the genious of their 1990's masterpiece, in my opinion, Hail to the thief is (was) their most brilliant effort.  Not one weak song in there. It's an apocaliptic journey and a heavenly lullaby. It samples and it strums, it's analog and it's digital. You can hear the basic five piece rock band doing what they could do in a garage with guitars, drums and a couple of amps, layerd together with tweaky computer chops and evolving synth pads. And then the lyrics and voices!     It's the uncertain future and the comfortable past, the babies crib, and the prostitutes' bed.  So strong and beautiful.    Ready to drink now, but improves over the years. Decant if possible.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|This movie sucked rocks, worst movie I've seen in years.  Would not recomend to any one. No real story line.  Acting was terrible.
1857988094|5.0|I liked how he was basically trapped in his house and how he adapted to at has happened to the world. And my favorite part was when he told of the peek hole to watch the vampires outside. And the lude acts the women vampires would do cause they knew he was watching.
0805066691|5.0|I first read Dee Brown's book, Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee (1970) as a college assignment. It changed the way I looked at America/our country, America/our history, and America/our land. The book is subtitled \\"An Indian History Of The American West\\", and focuses on the period of 1860 to 1890. This was after \\"The Trail Of Tears\\" of the 1830s, when the Cherokee, Choctaw, and other Indian nations were forced against their will to evacuate the eastern United States and move west. The book covers the Apaches, the Navajo, the Cheyenne, the Nez Percez, and the Sioux, among others. The wars, the injustices, and the sad fate of men, women, and children who died trying to pack up and move their lives yet once again. Brown doesn't portray the Indians as saints, either, but only as people with limited resources who, too many times, trusted the promises of a government that would, time after time, go back on it's word, and forcibly humiliate them. Brown also points out that sometimes the Indians overreacted by attacking innocent non-military settlements. Mostly the book is a concise account of the real Manifest Destiny story, and it expels the myths of the old American History 101 textbook, and the romantic Hollywood cowboy/injun-fighter version of our history. It's a tragic and cruel story, really. It's the true story of the progress of one generation of people at the expense of a civilization. Unfortunately that progress was paved with broken promises, injustice, and lives forever lost.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of those creations that didn't win immediate acceptance, but has become an enduring favorite.
B0000DJZ9T|3.0|This Video I thought could have been recorded in  higher Quality  Some of the songs were using such fast frames it makes your head spin, NOT enjoyable to watch.  Not a total poor video but could of been better !! Such a Great Band  Rich
B000RG1FMO|5.0|I love this album...this is rare for music today(being able to let the whole album play out without skipping songs) Just well thought out, cohesive...superb all the way around.  Kanye may not be the best lyricist out there, but he makes up for it with his production, song styling, cleverness, humor, etc. Just truly enjoyed this one!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|If you like Friends you like Friends, so whatever. The point though- this is a waaaay cheaper choice than buying the individual seasons. Really smart buy.
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|In the past I was never one to get my hopes up about a video game made into a movie...this series pleasantly surprised me(sans the latest one Extinction which left much to be desired) But Apocalypse had great pacing, great nonstop action, a little bit of everything for an action/horror style movie. Mila is great as always. I love Bluray, so crisp, and sharp, pounding audio, love it on my samsung lcd hdtv and surround sound home theatre system.
0316067598|5.0|I was not aware of how well trained Navy Seals are. I got an education from this book. Once you get past all the Seal training, you can't put this down. You will be done with it in a few hours. Great read. Thanks to Marcus, and all those who made it possible, for this book to be printed. Stories like this need to be exposed, to help us see the reality of what is going on.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love the show.  I can't get enough of it and I can't believe it was cancelled after only once season.  I'd love to see how the story would have progressed.
B0000542D2|1.0|Was looking forward to the DVD release - and low and behold a huge step backward compared to the MPI release. Maybe they did clean up the sound a bit - but that 'plus' is completely ruined by the poor print they used for this DVD. The MPI release was MUCH better, and I'm certainly holding on to mine. Thus learneth the lesson on marketing that promotes \\"new and improved\\" - especially from Miramax.
B000AP04FG|1.0|No really..not only was it silly but couldnt even get a chuckle out of me...<br />just watch \\"war of the roses\\" or \\"ruthless people\\" if you wanna see hubby and wives go at it.
B000I0QL82|2.0|November 10, 2014    Updating from previous comments - BLU RAY.    I was able to grab this the other day a local brick and mortar on BLU RAY.    I AM DISAPPOINTED ... (again).     ESPECIALLY SINCE ... on the back of the BLU RAY .... is says 'FULLY RESTORED'.     IT'S NOT. Don't buy into the packaging lie.    I can NOT see any difference ... same artifacts as the previous 'last version' they fed us. And I do not see much (if any) ... boost in picture quality.    The blacks are still 'too inky' ... and crush the detail in the dark areas. And again ... there are those OBVIOUS .... artifacts ...     This movie could and SHOULD look pristine. BUT ... I certainly am NOT going to buy again ... with the blind hope anymore from Universal.    --------------------------------------------------------       Why on earth they did a good remaster job on this and NOT bother to restore it also .... I'll never know. This is my one of my all time favorite movies. But I do have a different release of this on DVD and I'd much rather watch it - then be reminded that Universal botched this one. There are obvious places in this edition that are SOOO annoying visually - that are not even in the other DVD's - makes me wonder why go to all the trouble to remaster a lesser quality print of the film. *sigh*    UP DATE: January, 2014    Ok, lots of time has past since I initially posted about this DVD. Since then have watched all the copies I have at the moment ...    ... here's my STRONG RECOMMENDATIONS.    1.) For God sakes - DO NOT BUY - the 'now out of print' Holiday Inn (Three Disc Collector's Set) disc that is selling - you'll kick yourself until you end up in the hospital for that if you do. IT IS NOT WORTH ... $71.99 (!!!???) .... even with a 'colorized disc'.    If you need a 'quick fix' ... do yourself a favor and buy the 'Special Edition' one for $7.99. (It IS BETTER than the older discs ... - and from what I can presently see ... it's better than the '(Three Disc Collector's Set)'.Of the three different discs - the 'Special Edition' is the best of the bunch (so far). AND THE PRICE .. IS RIGHT TOO!    Now my 'quibbles' .... if you care to read why I say this.    I have an older disc - a 'two fer' ... of 'Going My Way / Holiday Inn'. It's noticeable less quality than the 'Special Edition' one. The 'Special Edition' says it's 'newly remaster' on the back. Yes - they did 'remaster' ... the picture is better.    BUT ... what they did NOT DO ... with the 'remaster' is FIX TWO MAJOR THINGS ... that sorely need to be DONE RIGHT. (and that means BOTH - the 'Special Edition' and the 'THREE DISC COLLECTORS SET')    1.) FIX THE 'ARTIFACTS' - UNIVERSAL !!! .... THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE VERY FIRST THING THAT WAS DONE ... WITH THE REMASTERING.    There REALLY IS .. NO EXCUSE ... for leaving the 'specs' ... 'dirt' ... bad places in the film anymore. THAT IS JUST JAW DROPPING ... in itself to leave so much bad spots in the film - ESPECIALLY THIS MOVIE TOO ! YES ... it's TIME CONSUMING. I know because I work with audio all the time - BUT THE RESULTS ARE WELL WORTH IT.    2.) Someone REALLY HAS TO FIX ... the 'flickering in the lighting' in the scenes. It's very noticeable - and very annoying. (Yes - it can be done too.)    3.) FIX THE needless 'jitter in a frame' ... get it centered ... and consistent. (very annoying too ... but fixable.)    NOW .... back to this OBSCENE price on the 3 disc set.    Although it's 'novel' that you get a 'new black and white version' ... - you ain't missing a thing here. It does look like someone tried some 'sharpening of the picture' ... BUT ... IT DID NOT HELP ... AT ALL. The picture looks too GRAINY ... and it even boosts the bad places in the film that were NOT fixed to begin with.    IT ALSO LOOKS ... like they tried to make the 'blacks blacker' ... but it's too much. Some scenes now look like it's lost it's definition. When the look at someone wearing a suite ... sometimes it's SO BLACK ... that's all you see - but no more details in the suite at all.    The 'colorized version' is 'just 'ok' at best - ... you WILL NOT LOOSE ANY SLEEP OVER IT ... and here's why ..    Same POOR REMASTERING .... - SAME BAD SPOTS IN THE FILM TOO - even  with color added. DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THESE HACKS THAT ARE TRYING TO SELL THIS ON AMAZON AT .... 72.00 BUCKS ! ... (it's insane). I could live with a pristine black and white .. over a colorized version any day.    NOW ... I have a REAL PROBLEM ... with the guys the colorized this movie too.    The colorization is 'ok'. Some of it does indeed help in some scenes - and I like it. Some of the coloring choices look a bit too 'out of place' at times. Seems someone liked 'burgundy' (I do too) ... but in places it was used ... it does NOT seem to fit. (A quibble I know - but still it doesn't seem to work with the holiday balloons - and some other places.)    BUT THE PEOPLE THAT COLORIZED THIS THING ..... KNEW ... they could fix a lot of the bad places in the film - because there is an 'added feature' on the DVD .... that SHOWS that very thing.    They even show you they have the movie computerized frame by frame. AND IF YOU WATCH IT CAREFULLY .. THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE DIGITAL TOOLS TO MAKE THIS MOVIE PRISTINE.    At the end of the feature - the guy says '... it was an 'intense 6 weeks' ......    Just six weeks huh? ....    My question is 'who did you snow at Universal' to get the work to begin with ? ... I WOULD HAVE MADE SURE ... AND STAKED MY REPUTATION ON MY WORK ... TO GIVE UNIVERSAL ... AND THE FANS OF THIS CLASSIC ... THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THING THEY HAD EVER SEEN IN THEIR LIFE.    (There's no way someone could 'snow me' by telling me ' well .. it was an 'intense' 6 weeks we worked on the film. I work with restoring audio all the time - and six weeks ain't nothing on a major project.)    UNIVERSAL  ... you are headed in the RIGHT DIRECTION.    DO THE BASICS ... FIX THE BAD SPOTS in the film ... don't OVER BLACKEN things ... DO NOT OVER SHARPEN ...and make it TOO GRAINY.  FIX THE LIGHTING FLICKERING in the film ... AND FIX THE PICTURE JITTER from scene to scene.    (If you have to - go back and do A BETTER TRANSFER ...... and start from scratch ... and THEN BUILD ON THAT ...)    UNIVERSAL ... I am A LONG STANDING CONSUMER ... AND A LONG STANDING FAN .... PLEASE DO US ALL A HUGE FAVOR ... AND DO NOT BE SLOPPY ... NEXT TIME.
0316172324|4.0|Gladwell takes a fascinating topic -- how the mind works without us knowing it -- and does some of his best reporting work. He covers a broad spectrum of research and events that are fascinating, especially when connected under the broader topic. I've read it twice and referred to it several other times. I was hoping for something at the end to give me clarity on what to do with the information now that I have it, but it wasn't there. That may have been intentional on the author's part; he might want us to draw our own conclusions. But that was an expectation I developed as I was reading that wasn't fulfilled in the end. That does not in any way take away from the quality of the writing and the expansiveness of the information. \\"Blink\\" quickly made my list of favorite reads.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Like everybody else, I tought that this movie would be GREAT because it was directed by Quentin Tarantino!! BUT IS PURE GARBABE!!!!!<br /><br />The movie itself is PURE BORING BLAH,BLAH,BLAH!!! 90% of talking and 10% of action!! I think this movie is for girl because of the conversations and the STUPID ending!!! The ending was the only action scene and it wasn't THAT cool! I seen a lot of feminist movies but this one is definitely the WORST!!! If you want feminism watch: The Luc Besson movies, I Spit on your Grave or Kill Bill!<br /><br />Pulp Fiction is the best film of Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill was COOL, Resevoir Dogs was GREAT, Jackie Brown was so-so and this one is the WORST!!!<br />I don't care if this movie is a tribute to the 70's car movies! I saw Grand Theft Auto (1977) and it was MUCH BETTER this piece of s*&^!!!<br /><br />Sorry! but this movie is Quentin at his worst!!<br /><br />Adios.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Now, I'm not a Die Hard Beatles fan. I knew several of their songs, but nothing ground breaking. But this album is amazing, it's made me go and listen to all their original stuff which is just as good. It's great for background music or blasting in your car on the way to work.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|This double CD was really one of a kind. Every song Donna sings she does it quite well. A must have CD set to remember her in the hay days of disco.Your old favorites will be there as well as some songs that I havn't heard before, but began to like real well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is great.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure, good interaction in a cast, has a good sense of humor.  Who knew the wild west could blend with outer space?!
B000001FS6|5.0|I love this CD!  U2 played the Cain's Ballroom in 1982 and hearing all these songs was great!
B000T05R8Q|5.0|This 40th Anniversary edition is just what all Syd and Piper fans have been waiting for! The reproduction of the Syd book inside is a nice touch and well as the alternate version of Matilda Mother! Maybe when they release the 40th Saucerful we'll get the rest of the unreleased Syd tracks! Pretty please???
B0009S4IHY|4.0|When I saw this movie in the theatre, I laughed until my stomach hurt. The movie is so ingeniously conceived that there are hilarious surprises throughout. The action sequences, both the real ones and the animated ones, are fun to watch. As do many other Stephen Chow movies, this movie tells the bittersweet (yes, somewhat simplistic) story of a downtrodden person, managing to be entertaining along the way.    Since the laughs are mostly based on action and surprise, its entertainment value diminishes the second time you watch it. So, bottom line: you should rent this movie, watch it together with friends, and have a very pleasant movie night. Just do not watch it a second time.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I can't believe the negative reviews! This is classic Springsteen from his narrative lyrics to his E-Street sound. I love every magical note of it!
B00007AJF9|5.0|With the sequel just days away from opening in theatres,I revisited Shekhar Kapur's 1998 ELIZABETH starring Cate Blanchett.I loved it the two times I saw it years back, and I still believe that this is a lasting classic film to be enjoyed and savoured over and over again for its stellar performances ,cinematography,soundtrack and 2 hour length.  Any time I review an historical film,I first of all consider  crucial thoughts,which are \\"did I enjoy the film,the screenplay,the acting,the music,the camerawork etc? And ultimately,\\"did the film move along?\\" The answer is a RESOUNDING YES to Kapur's film.Is it historically accurate?....ehh!...somewhat yes,a lot maybe,some definitely not;BUT I am rating a film,not history.Wikipedia has loads of information on all of the characters and events in this film for anyone to learn more.I will say this,that no version of The Virgin Queen's life is 100% accurate simply because not everything is known for certain involving many of the \\"players\\" in Elizabeth Tudor's Reign.So, those that like Helen Mirren,good.If you prefer Glenda Jackson's performance, magnificent.If you need historical accuracy,you best not see any of them!!! As a film, though,this ELIZABETH for style and substance,is my favorite.Cate Blanchett and the entire ensemble is first class.I was surprised to see Daniel Craig as the murderous priest.Boy, has he gone on to great success since killing off Kelly MacDonald!  I am eagerly anticipating the sequel,ELIZABETH:THE GOLDEN AGE to see Cate go after Mary Queen of Scots this time!Again,will she be beheaded with one,two or three axe swings and did a little dog run out from under her skirts??? See what I mean? Judge the film and leave history where it is much of the time...in lore,legend and apocrypha!
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I agree with many of the other reviews.  Hybrid Theory and Meteora are AMAZING albums.  The first time I listened to this album I was very disappointed. What I've done seems like the only original sound of Linkin Park on this album.  I read their cover and then realized that they wanted to do something different and to go out of their comfort zone....that they did.  But I'm like everyone else....I want their heavy rock/rap sound back!!  Hopefully their next album will have more of the original LP sound!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|[[ASIN:B000R7GKQE Supernatural - The Complete Second Season]]    I have been a Supernatural fan since the beginning of the series and have been interested in the supernatural since I was a child. The mythology and lore in this season is very well written. I particularly liked the episode \\"Tall Tales\\" which featured a trickster. The special features in this set add to the overall experience of the series.
B000UR366S|4.0|One thing you have to admit about Joni Mitchell, she has always been an honest artist.  Those of us who are familiar with her artistry can attest that \\"Shine\\" is a testimony to this.  Although the subject matter and even the musicality of the album is \\"dark\\" and heartbreakingly sad, it lends itself to an honesty that only Joni Mitchell can command.  The title track, \\"Shine\\", is achingly sad but profound.  One cannot listen to this track and help but feel a magnitude of sorrow for our poor planet.  The way in which the melody is developed reveals the genuine feelings and conviction of the poet, singer, songwriter and artist that Joni is.  She has never hidden her feelings about society and never is it more evident in this beautiful palate of truth-telling.  \\"If I had a Heart\\" is another winner.  \\"Holy Earth, how can we heal you - we cover you like a blight\\" says more than any website dedicated to protecting our planet.  \\"Hana\\" is closer to her older works, but I am intrinsically more drawn to the deeper tones of this album where she speaks of the issues we should all be awakened to and sadly are not.  Leave it to Joni to smack us in the face with realities we'd rather leave alone.  I am thankful that such an artist is still living and breathing in this world who isn't afraid to make yet another statement about what we don't get and why we should awaken and scream out as she does on this album.  Kudos to you, Joni.  You are one of the brightest lights that shine on in this world.  Continue to write, continue to speak out, continue to make significant art.  Perhaps soon, we will all come out of our comas and join you in the fight.
B000OYC3J8|3.0|I bought this after hearing two of the singles on the radio, and those are the best two on the CD.
0743486285|4.0|This book will bring you into a world of drugs and Rock n Roll that will shock you!
0743486285|5.0|A great read, read in one day.  Here is a rock star who had it all, but due to abandonment issues he could not overcome, succumbs to addiction. Abandonment is a serious issue with kids that can devastate them over their life if not taken care of.  Reading this book makes me want to be a better father. Great book!

Sutherland, Pavarotti and, of course, Mehta. Given that it's a Puccini piece (one of my favourite composers) you'd expect me to rave a bit. Lots of exclamation marks and other grammatical expressions of temporary insanity.    Oh, it's a pleasant-enough piece of work and undoubtedly an audio snapshot of Pavarotti at his best working with Sutherland (who was better). There simply couldn't be a better choice than Mehta to bake all of this into something irresistible and terribly bad for you. And yet, and yet.    Yes, it is pleasant-enough and perhaps it's Puccini's choice of storyline that begins to reign it in and hold it back from the finish line of fist-pumping, wild-eyed ecstacy (do opera lovers do that?). Sadly, no-one has ever managed to marry European melodic forms with a Chinese theme and produce an offspring that had that 'carry-you-away' quality. (And, no, nothing by Gilbert & Sullivan qualifies as an exception to that.)    Perhaps its the recording standards of 1990 that keep this from being audio heroin. I don't know - all I know is that I find it pleasant-enough and a decent accompaniment to other tasks that leave have my mind free to listen.     Operatic muzak? Not quite but not a great deal more either.

142333292X|4.0|I listened to the CD of this book and thought it excellent and very interesting.  History that I was certainly unaware of, read well.  Afterwards, I actually did some research on the events  I write very short reviews; either good, bad or indifferent.  This was excellent.
1577311523|5.0|I find this handbook handy to refresh my memory after reading The Power of Now.
0201626632|5.0|This is a great little book for those who have recently gotten their Ph.D.'s  or postdocs, and are wondering: \\"what next?\\".  The book touches on everything from giving good talks, writing good papers, and even comparing the pros and cons of various career tracks.  This should be essential reading for young scientists.
0688172377|5.0|This book was both heart wrentching and inspiring. It was a beautiful story. I would like to use this book in class. I think it should be a mandatory read for everyone. This woman has become my hero. I plan on reading all her other books as well.
B00005JCAA|5.0|Originally went to see this as the theatre promised to show the trailer for the latest STAR WARS movie, but the movie turned out to be the highlight of the evening .. ..<br /><br />A beautifully-made movie, stellar cast and just a treat for the senses .. ..<br /><br />The last, riveting segment of the movie (Anthony Hopkins' Birthday Party) has become my favorite minutes in movie history .. .. It led me to purchasing the movie soundtrack and DVD .. ..<br /><br />Perhaps a box-office flop, but one of my favorite movies - OF ALL TIME!
0723257639|5.0|A lovely collection of Beatrix Potters childrens stories. The original illustrations are best for little girls and their imagination. Even adults enjoy it.
B00005J6T1|3.0|Here it is, her premiere release. It's a cheesy, 80s bubblegum pop album with some RnB mixed into it, so much that in fact, a lot of people in the early 80s thought that she was African-American. This CD does include some of her big hits, like \\"Everybody\\", \\"Burning Up\\", and \\"Lucky Star\\".
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I was a big fan of Creed until of course Scott Stapp starting ruining their sound. Thankfully they ditched him and formed Alter Bridge. Their first cd was good, but not great. But I just can't stop listening to this one. \\"Ties That Bind\\" and \\"Come to Life\\" are perfect for rocking out and \\"Brand New Start\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" are great for when you're feeling a bit more mellow. I knew they had the potential to be great, expect more good things to come from these guys.
B000A88F22|1.0|Okay, I admit it, I own this album. I bought it because I like Britney, the train wreck she is. I did not buy this to watch any of the horrible episodes that aired on the UPN network in mid 2005, but because it contains 2 new videos, \\"Do Somethin'\\" and the new track \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\". It also contains a CD of three (count 'em, three!) new songs: \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\", \\"Chaotic\\", and \\"Mona Lisa\\". The Japanese release of the \\"Someday...\\" single contains these songs and an additional track \\"Over To You Now\\".
B000TGCR3I|5.0|HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN since your imagination and heart has been captured by a film? If it's been a while, check out \\"Tekkonkinkreet\\" (\\"Treasure Town\\") from first time director Michael Arias. This is animation for adults at its best. Visuals are striking, the sound dynamic and genuine, characterization is breathtaking - but you will have to bring along your imagination.     Old city citizens, especially those who long to preserve the historic areas of their town, might find a touchstone here. The complex story is based on a manga (graphic novel series) from Taiyo Matsumoto that Arias picked up when he moved to Japan some 17 years ago. The central theme deals with change and how a long established city, such as Tokyo, cannot expand except by tearing down its old structures and neighborhoods. As Arias roamed his new city, he would frequently chance onto a beloved building demolished for new construction.     Arias, who has worked in film - primarily creating computer graphics for films like \\"The Abyss,\\" \\"Animatrix\\" and \\"Princess Mononoke\\" - said it was \\"Tekkonkinkreet\\" that moved him to step into the director's position.     The story evolves around the brilliantly colorful ghetto world of two orphaned street brothers, Black and White. Black is the smart, older kid, a survivor intent on taking care of the younger child, White. White is a special charmer, lost in a much younger child's dream world. A developer, Mr. Snake, plans to demolish Treasure Town to build a theme park along the scale of Disneyland or Busch Gardens. He allies with the local yakuza to accomplish this, creating a rift between a profit-loving godfather and a traditional mobster who loves the neighborhood. A pair of sympathetic detectives and other street folk help and hinder as \\"Treasure Town\\" unfolds.    Those used to the superb animation of Miyazaki, will find the Matsumoto's images, handled by animation director Mashiko Kubo, quite different and no less compelling. \\"Tekkonkinkreet\\" is an amazing blend of CGI and traditional hand-drawn art. It's beautifully complex with sharp detail and vibrant color. As for sound, it is simply amazing. The streets are alive, the soundtrack and voices are perfect. Do yourself a favor and watch this in Japanese with English subtitles. This brilliant, beautiful film slipped by us in its theatrical release. Don't miss it in on DVD. - Kay Reynolds, The Virginian-Pilot
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I was at a friends house when they suggested we watch this movie. In the first few minutes, I thought I would be bored out of my mind, but once the story took off, I was hooked.<br /><br />\\"Kinky Boots\\" is based on the true story of a struggling shoe factory in Northern England. As a last resort, the young head of the factory decides to make \\"womens boots for men\\". Why? It was becauase he met \\"Lola\\", a fabulous drag queen from London who complained that because she was a man, her weight kept breaking the heels off of her ladies' boots.<br /><br />A wonderful story with wonderful musical numbers that will leave you singing for more when you're done! I could watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Saw this @ IMAX. Despite historical inaccuracies and my embarassment at someone my age liking this kind of movie so much, I loved it!!
B00005J6T0|4.0|This album is where she found her niche (in my opinion). This was her most grown-up sounding album (at the time) and was the first to feature heavy writing credits from Madonna herself. There are a lot of gems on this CD, even some non singles:<br /><br />True Blue<br />White Heat<br />Jimmy Jimmy<br />Papa Don't Preack<br /><br />to name a few...
B000002J0B|5.0|After all these years (some thirty- plus,) it's hard to believe I detested this album when I first heard it. Why? Perhaps the eclectic nature, each song borrowing heavy elements from widely varied genres. And, to me, Robert Plant was using far too much falsetto on these songs. And the simplistic lyrics on a few of the songs, after being spoiled by thoughtful, mysterious lyrics on the previous release. In any event, I could barely listen to this release! What was a teenager in the 70's to do?  No dude could admit to disliking a Led Zeppelin release. I wanted to like it, especially after discarding practically every other band upon hearing their first excellent releases. This is when persistance paid off in a major way. I kept listening, returning to this strange mixture of tunes often. I never disavowed the music, but some of the vocals and lyrics just made me squirm! But this album grew on me to the point that it became my favorite by this band. The varying nature of the songs became what I really enjoy and this band would never have been the same without Robert Plant, who added a mysterious, Celtic vibe to the band that softened the sledgehammer riffs and heavy blues. \\"The Rain Song\\" is my favorite song ever written, still arousing deep feelings within me after all this time. So, the moral of the story: First impressions aren't always very accurate and some things are worth being patient with.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Though \\"Ray Of Light\\" is still my favorite Madonna album, this CD is now my second favorite. There are no ballads on this CD, just upbeat dance numbers throughout. It contains the singles \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"Get Together\\", and \\"Jump\\", but there are several other gems on this album.<br /><br />As her 80s collection, \\"You Can Dance\\" was, this CD is also continuously mixed into a nonstop dance floor throw down. The only way to get them as stand alone songs is to purchase the quickly vanishing limited edition pink vinyl of the album or purchase the individual songs from iTunes.<br /><br />The special edition of this CD also contains a bonus track ('Fighting Spirit'), 2 books, and special hard packaging.
6302158095|5.0|Rather than reviewing something that's been commented upon for nearly 70 years,I suggest that this classic be used as a primer for young children to be introduced to classical music. Try viewing it in small segments,in direct proportion to the child's age and attention span. Classrooms, youth centers,as well as the home would all benefit and who knows? Maybe one child or several may someday rank the film above \\"BEACH BLANKET BINGO.\\"
B00004X01U|3.0|This was Madonna's biggest selling album until 2005's \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" was released.<br /><br />Most fans think this album was rushed in order to capitalize on the success of its predecessor, 1998's \\"Ray Of Light\\", and they're probably right. This album used a different producer than ROL, bringing in the then unknown Mirwais Ahmadzhai to complete the album. Why she didn't use William Orbit on this album like she should have remains a mystery. He still produced three tracks on this album, and those ones are the stand out tracks.
6304712936|5.0|Movie making at its best. This somewhat forgotten classic is rarely seen on television and is worth every penny of purchase or rental.Abraham won a well deserved Oscar, yet it's Hulce who steals the show with his credible,offbeat portrayal of Mozart.Oh well, perhaps life is just as unfair today as it was in 18th century Austria. Whether or not you've seen this production, further babble from this reviewer can do nothing to heighten viewer interest. Let the show begin!
B00008VGK0|3.0|These mixes, like the album version, are not that good. However, the 'Oakenfold Downtempo Mix' is awesome and worth buying this whole CD for. The remaining mixes on this CD are obviously meant for club play, but I don't know a DJ in his/her right mind who would play them in a club. The other mix is by Missy Elliot, and while I respect her as an artist, her mix of this song is terrible. It just sounds like a bunch of noise with no organization to it at all.
B000VWYJ8G|4.0|The third movie installment turns out more thrills and dead bodies.<br /><br />Bourne is still searching for the truth of who he really is when he comes in contact with a reporter who has been searching too. This chance meeting leads to the \\"bad\\" guys finding out Bourne is still alive and then all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />More great hand-to-hand fight scenes, though a little harder to follow than the earlier movies.<br /><br />More chase scenes with some great car stunts. I loved the realism of the scenes where our good guy gets pretty banged up too in the car crashes.<br /><br />More of Bourne's history is revealed.<br /><br />More bad guy's exposed.<br /><br />Alliances created and old ones deepened. Even a new/old love interest shows promise in this one.<br /><br />Bourne is again a machine that is innovative and lethal<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If some of the action wasn't so difficult to follow I'd give this a 5 star. But suffice it to say, my wife and I both felt it was worth the movie ticket, popcorn and drink fee to go and enjoy it on the big screen. Go see it or just buy it when it comes out (the DVD will be cheaper than the theater experience anyhow). If you loved the first two movies then this is just more of the same so you won't be disappointed.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is my favorite Madonna album. It is pure ear candy from start to finish. It includes the hit singles \\"Frozen\\", \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"The Power Of Good-Bye\\", and in Europe, \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\". This album is very electronica heavy. It was produced by electronica genious Britan's own William Orbit. This album put her back on the map after being gone from the music scene with new music for the previous six years.
B00003CXAY|5.0|Excellent films, great music.  Provocative.  They (with the third, yet unavailable 3rd  piece of the Qatsi trilogy, aid in understanding  our impact on and separation from the natural  world.  No story, no dialogue just visuals and  music.  The Glass's music has great impact
B000BKDOCA|3.0|Most of the mixes on this CD can be found on previous releases. There is one new song on this CD, \\"And Then We Kiss.\\" It's nothing too exciting, but if you like to dance, this is a good CD for you.
B000ROALE4|1.0|swlayer is one of those bands that is like a roach they just dont go away theyve made like 20 albums and still havent made it repetitive guitar and drums all albums sound the same give it up slayer your not going to make it just not that great of a band people need to understand that 5 4.5 stars means the album is rated a classis not you like them so give them 5 if this album was a classic it would have at least sold 500,000 copies not under 100,000
B000BJS4F8|4.0|This is the only place you can get the song \\"Crazy\\" (except for the CD single of the same name), the Seal cover that Alanis has openly named her \\"favorite song ever\\". If you buy it on iTunes, you can also get the ORIGINAL version of the song, the Tony Kanal mix (the version on the CD is the James Michaels mix that was released to radio).
B000UJBYD8|1.0|Love. Electric. Sonic Temple. What happenned? This sounds like a collection of demos. Billy Duffy's legendary guitar playing is not here (the solos, what few there are, sound remedial). The lyrics are stupid. What a waste of $11.99. There's only one good song (not great) called \\"Illumination\\". Maybe you can download it.
B00005J6SZ|4.0|Madonna's sophomore effort weilded a more bubblegum sound than her first album. This album also spawned a huge number of hits like \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", and \\"Angel\\". It's a cute nostalgic album. A fun buy!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This album is absolutly the perfect rock album on first listen, from start to finish, lyrically and musically, and only gets better with subsequent listens. The music is pure joy, the lyrics are moving, and I don't think a \\"Classic Rock\\" genre album of this caliber has been released in years. Even if your just a casual fan of Bruce as I am, anyone who is a fan of classic rock wil Love this CD. Buy it now!
B000002N3J|4.0|This is a great collection of Madonna's greatest ballad hits. It also includes some new songs, \\"I Want You\\" (and an orchestral remix), \\"One More Chance\\", and the defiant \\"You'll See\\" to name a few. This is the more easily accessable place to find \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" which was recorded (but not used) for the 'A League Of Their Own' but was later placed on the hard-to-find CD, 'Barcelona Gold'. It's a wonderful well rounded collection. Rumor has it that Madonna will release a volume 2 of ballad hits in the future. When, who knows?
0060007737|5.0|Excellent book. Although the 22 laws may not be immutable they definitely are impossible to overlook. This book is packed with practical examples of where major corporations failed and succeeded, by breaking or following each of the 22 laws. Definitely must read if you're interested in creating a strong brand.
B000V9KFLY|5.0|Celine is one of the few people who can successfully pull off a holiday album. This is a wonderful album for the holiday season, and while it leans mostly towards the Christmas holiday, it also features wonderful classics like \\"Ave Maria\\" and \\"Brahms' Lullaby.\\"<br /><br />This is worth the buy.
0143038419|5.0|I have to admit that this is the best book I've read in years !! Very good job !!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Like most people, I got my first glimpse of this concert on PBS. It is absolutely wonderful. However, for this series, they added a \\"new\\" girl to thie group, Haylie. While she is an accomplished singer and solo artist in Ireland, her voice doesn't \\"mesh\\" well with the other girls' voices. This DVD also contains some new songs that were only included on the special editon of \\"Celtic Woman: A New Journey\\" CD. Including the fun \\"Spanish Lady\\", \\"At The Ceili\\", and \\"Sing Out\\".
B0002EXH54|2.0|Good riffs, good solo but sound like 1980 and I don't like chorus in each toune like peace sell... but who is buy, on repeat!I waited for a album like rust in peace.
B000BC8STM|2.0|This is a DVD of a TV special. It's missing a couple of songs. My firs impressions of Cher were from seeing the Believe Tour on DVD and the Farewell tour twice in person and on DVD. This DVD is a step down. Granted, it's from 15 years ago (or so) when concert technology wasn't as cutting edge as it is today. I found this concert to be kind of a snoozer as far as a Cher show goes.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Erin Brockovich is an outstanding and realistic true story filled with emotion, real life situations, great humor, and a sense of satisfaction.  You won't see a better example of Justice in action.  Highly recommend this movie for those who actually had to work for a living and scratch and claw their way to the top.  This movie is also a vindication of the theory, which I have also found to be true in my 28 years in the corporate world and in government, that when hiring individuals for a specific job, experience and education is less important than the quality and character of the individual you are hiring.  You can train a good and intelligent person to do about anything, and do it better than most.  The extra investment in time and attention pays back tenfold.
B000002LLC|3.0|The edit version of Madonna's hit 'Vogue' is the last track on this album. It doesn't quite fit with the rest of the album, which is going for a \\"40s lounge singer\\" feel. \\"Vogue\\" was later included on \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" in its entirety.<br /><br />While this album is weak as a whole, there are some fun songs on it, like \\"Hanky Panky\\", \\"I'm Going Bananas\\", \\"Now I'm Following You\\", and the Oscar winning \\"Sooner Or Later\\".
B000QXDED6|3.0|Concept de la cruauté et du sacrifice, dans un élan à la fois barbare et baroque, le film remplit son contrat : montrer des corps sans la nudité, des élans d'affection sans amour. Une pâle copie de la vie dans des couleurs où la flamboyance se teinte de cendres. Un futur classique du péplum ultra sophistiqué.
B000002LND|5.0|Here they are, the songs that everyone knows and loves. These are not the album versions though, and they are not the radio edits either. Most of them are the versions used during 1990's Blond Ambition Tour, as heard in the documantary \\"Madonna: Truth Or Dare\\" / \\"In Bed With Madonna\\". Sadly, that version of \\"Like A Virgin\\" isn't included :(
B0001V6ZJ8|2.0|On a souligné la performance de José Ferrer, mais son ton sentencieux m'agace un peu...La faute aux dialogues, quelquefois académiques. Etant français, je retiendrai surtout l'apparition de Suzanne Flon, car la prestation de la maîtresse de Lautrec, dans la première partie du film, est tout simplement exaspérante.  Mais au fait, who is Zsa Zsa Gabor???
B00005Q66T|4.0|This CD contains more of Madonna's hits from after the time that \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" was released. However, there are no new studio tracks on this CD. Every track on this CD is also the Radio Edit of the song in question. The only people I know who eagerly seek out these hard-to-come-by radio edits are the die hard Madonna fans (like myself).<br /><br />While some of the songs I question as to their status as a \\"greatest hit\\", like \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" (wasn't 'You Must Love Me' a bigger hit? Yes, it was, and yet it's not included here) and \\"Deeper And Deeper\\" (I can honestly say I have NEVER hear this song on the radio).
0307237699|5.0|This was am amazing book by an amazing man. Really unique viewpoint and an interesting perspective with which to view American politics. Obama is obviously brilliant and is an American political historian...love that aspect, especially. His passion for this country and making the lives of the American people better shines through on every page. His humility, honesty and humanity are refreshing. He's idealistic, but no doormat. The man has drive and ambition...wonderful qualities for someone looking to make the lives of others better. He's smart, genuine and sees the big picture...what's best for America as a whole. He gives the reader not just his opinions or snippets of American history, but also a candid look at his own personal journey. He's obviously a Democrat, but shows appreciation and admiration for some individual Repbulicans, too. Wonderfully refreshing change from the usual hatemongering between parties that has become the ugly norm in America in recent years.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved this movie! It stays pretty true to the book, it is pretty long, being on two discs, but its a short long movie! The casting is amazing, this is exactly how i pictured the characters would look, and as it is one of the best books ever, the story is timeless! MUST SEE!!
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|When I first listened to this cd, I fell in love with it. With this cd, Rihanna brought a new and different sound.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|\\"Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude. The Dude, from Los Angeles.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Dude\\" never had much use for his given name, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And for a man who lives to drink White Russians and bowl with his friends, who needs a big old name like that?  His real name is the source of much of his trouble in The Big Lebowski, however, as he is mistaken for a millionaire with the same name whose wife \\"owns money all over town\\".  Played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, long hair and oversized pajama bottoms and Bermuda shorts that look like he stole from a homeless man, the pot-smoking Dude passes through life with the constant abandonment of a lazy summer day...until goons seeking the other Lebowski assault him and urinate on the rug that \\"really tied the room together, man.\\"<br /><br />The resulting action is a charming, meandering follow-up to The Coen Brothers' critically acclaimed Fargo.  Although the two have a few cast members in common and the Coens' trademark of finding art in shots of day-to-day life (a great montage of bowlers plays with the opening credits), the films have little in common.  Where Fargo was an unrelenting drama, full of suspense and mystery, The Big Lebowski is more of a good time.  Yeah, there's a plot in there about how Lebowski's search for retribution for his soiled rug thrusts him into a kidnapping caper with pornographers and nihilists, but the film is more about The Dude, the man for his time and place.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|The only thing I can say about this cd is the fact that I love it. I feel that I can relate to it more. I also like how Kelly comes out with cds not only shows her Rock side, but also her R&B side.
B000002KNI|3.0|Hey, I like S&G as much as anyone, really.  But this concert was a misguided force-fit of the delicate beauty of a consummate acoustic duo onto a bloated, sluggish, highly-synthetic excuse for a rock band.  Weird how they chose to go this route.  Artifact of a whole era of weird choices.  Listen to how long it takes the engine to turn over in \\"Kodachrome\\"....sounds like an old Ford that should have scrapped long ago.  Guess they figured a big crowd needed a big band ?  Primitive thinking.  Or was the band a psychological buffer between the 2 who were still at odds...?
B000OMD4BG|4.0|Elliott Smith rocks my world.  It's too bad to have lost a talent like his.  This cd captures his sound very personally and raw.  A good double-disc collection.
0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi is at the least, a first rate adventure yarn. Even the simplest reader needs just to suspend a small amount of disbelief to join in the fun. There is enough texture to the writing-detail of place and experience-that the book is almost cinematic. You could imagine this being filmed as a simple 'survival in a lifeboat' story.<br />What makes this such a wonderful tale is that each little piece-the man-eating island, the orangutan, Pi's wonderful real name, is jolting and provocative. It's hard to hear the stories without connecting them to some other fantasy or alternative reality.<br />At the end, Pi's rescue and redemption are really nothing more than the technique of fantasy applied to the story itself. I'm sorry for the folks who were disappointed that this wasn't one kind of book and I hope they get a chance to experience the pleasure of it being a very good fable, fiction and fantasy.<br /><br />----Lynn Hoffman, author of [[ASIN:0131186361 New Short Course in Wine,The]]  and the slightly fabulous [[ASIN:1601640005 bang BANG: A Novel]]
B000U618C8|5.0|Jose Gonzalez is melodic, intimate, and subtly profound.  With 'In Our Nature,' he continues to impress.  Buy his albums.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|At time the movie looks fantastic.  I don't know if it is fancy editing but at times there seems to be a filter or effect that makes the picture look a little less than high-def.  Overall good.
B000UJCALI|5.0|This movie was widescreen in the theaters! Kubrick only \\"preferred\\" full-screen video releases of his films because the only other option in the 80's was to crop the sides of the picture off. There was no such thing as anamorphic widescreen dvds or widescreen tvs when this was his \\"preference\\". Instead they removed the matting on the tops and bottom to make the image square (more or less) for tv. This sometimes revealed things not meant to be seen (helicopter shadows in the opening etc.)     If you've ever seen Pee-Wee's Big Adventure in full screen you know what I mean. In that you could see dolly tracks, the never ending bike chain coming up under his bike etc.      The original aspect ratio was WIDESCREEN. That's the image we were meant to see. The old dvd of The Shining was a crap job, and not the original aspect ratio. The \\"director's preferred version\\" was a way out of context comment. The studio just didn't want to bother remastering the film last time.
B000F9RB94|4.0|Looks good but I wonder if this was actually shot in HD.  It seems like it may be an upscaled version of the original.
0316067598|5.0|An excellent true life story describing the dangers faces by our men in uniform. Those willing to give their all for what they believe. And one mans story of survival. A gripping account of the minute by minute suffering and of the determination that one man had to survive.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Every second of both DVDs is worth watching and listening. David Gilmour is, and surrounds himself with, the best of the best to perform masterful musical entertainment.
0307237699|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I read this book a while back, and I re-read it just last week now that Obama is a major Presidential contender. This book is very well written in terms of style and syntax, plus it takes us on a journey of man grappling serioulsy with issues of hope, worth, justice, patriotism and social obligation. It seems that whatever the outcome of the election, Obama believes in decency and hope and has pledged to do his part to make this a better society. It reads well, makes you think and makes you actually glimpse an American  living closer to  its ideal. This is a must read!
0440238609|1.0|While I admit that Pullman has considerable skill as a writer, I'd like to warn others that these books are blatantly anti-Christian.  Do a simple Google search of the authors name or the book titles and you'll find plenty to concern you IF you are Christian.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|A friend of mine bought the DVD version of this and I was so impressed I bought an HD player so I could get the HD version. The episodes are all present and they're in glorious HD, but there are NO special features!     The plain DVD set has the \\"Planet Earth Diaries\\" after each episode. This is a 10 min behind the scenes look at the filming of that episode. Unfortunately this was NOT included on the HD version. The regular DVD set also has an entire DVD devoted to \\"Planet Earth: The Future\\" and that is not found on this HD edition. I find it ridiculous that the HD version has less than the reglar DVD version.    That being said, the series is still spectacular and well worth owning. You might be better off buying the regular DVD set though.

B000MNP2KI|1.0|[[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)]]      This should have been a film to remember yet it is not.   The plot is unoriginal and weak, the acting mediocre, the characters unconvincing, the situations are juvenile and stray well beyond the bounds of silliness whilst the film itself is so poorly made that the soundtrack is for much of the time quite inaudible.  If this is the best that can be done, perhaps it is time to bury Mr Bond, once and for all.

It's one of the essential elements of our cultural literacy.  The DVD allows the viewer to see much more of the film and much more in the film than the old VHS copy I've had for years.  The only flaw is that it does not divide the story into chapters, as most presentations now do.  But it's a minor blemish.  Everyone should see this film.

B000TQAF8M|4.0|After issuing a set of EPs and singles, United Kingdom's Oceansize made a strong start with their highly acclaimed debut Effloresce in 2003 and backed it up with Everyone into Position two years later. Though there is no general consensus as to which album is more successful, it seems the opinions are based on the listeners' expectations moreso than the musical quality put on display.<br /><br />In many ways, Frames evokes the denser, more detailed sound of Effloresce, in part because it was produced by the same engineer, Chris Sheldon. Unlike the Coldplay guy who worked on Everyone into Position, Sheldon favours a sharper production with more space. That, however, is where the similarities between the first and third albums end, as Frames sees the band expand on a more accessible soundscape than either of its predecessors. With the exception of track two, \\"Unfamiliar\\", the album forges its own path relying heavily on atmospheric depth and melancholy-inducing elements.<br /><br />The aforementioned \\"Unfamiliar\\" feels like a leftover from their earlier sessions, given its brisk rhythm guitar attacks, alternative rock-styled vocal delivery which occasionally borders on aggressive onslaughts, and heavy finish, amidst a dense pool of wailing guitars and pounding drum beats. It is questionable how well this kind of aggression suits the otherwise mid-tempo-paced material on the album, one exception being \\"Sleeping Dogs and Dead Lions\\". However, the tracklisting of Frames deems it necessary for such a bludgeoning piece to appear between the experimental instrumental cut and powerful finale. This song unleashes a wave of dissonance, rarely heard on their other albums, and erupts into a bass-centred rhythm, underpinned by maniacal screaming, heavy drum syncopation, and violent, relatively more technical instrumentation.<br /><br />The frequent incorporation of synths on some of the tunes has rendered them more spacey, particularly on \\"Trail of Fire\\" and \\"Savant\\". The former is a ballad-like anthem, focusing on solo piano; and a steady, powerful build-up with lofty acoustic guitars and whisper-like vocal manipulations. Oceansize creates an epic in the form of \\"Savant\\": it has a cinematic bent to it, sort of like a movie soundtrack. Driven by drawn-out instruments, mellow vocal lines, and cool percussion, the ending boasts an almost classically inspired coda -- it's truly beautiful.<br /><br />Vocalist Mike Vennart gives a semi-spoken, semi-sung performance on \\"Only Twin\\", surrounded by shades of synth layers, and a tenacious, drum machine-like cadence. However, it isn't until the ten-minute instrumental \\"An Old Friend of the Christies\\" kicks in when it becomes apparent how talented this young band really is. The funereal acoustic guitars, doomy drumming a la early 90's British doom acts, and a lucid string element form the framework for the ambitious composition. Halfway through, three-part guitar melodies are filtered through myriad sound effects in order to create a thicker, heavier body. The way each repeated note grows to an epic-size monster at the end is testimony to their potential.<br /><br />The first and last songs are in a way direct opposites to each other. The opener boasts overtly repeated guitar notes overlapping the big drum sound and rising to complex crescendos, whilst the title track, another ten-minute cut, is slightly reminiscent of Godspeed You Black Emperor with vocals. As the band produces strong melodies and sprinkles single-note acoustic bits throughout the piece, the vocalist's desperate croon works phenomenally atop the discreet keyboard line, not to mention the final guitar at the very end. Those who won't sit through the album patiently will unfortunately miss out on one of the most beautifully constructed melodies of the year.<br /><br />With that said, and while wholeheartedly agreeing that Frames is bound to become Oceansize's breakthrough, I cannot help but think the best from them is yet to come. Oncethey continue to refine their songcraft with their huge creative range, more people will discover them. The addition of greater amount of post-rock sounds and progressive structures into their albums will surely culminate in more accomplished efforts in the future.<br /><br />I personally was reluctant to check Frames out right away, having heard their previous two discs and evaluating them as \\"good but not great\\" albums. However, once I saw the album listed in Steven Wilson's playlist, I decided to give it a chance -- I'm glad I did. This is their best work so far, but they will surpass it -- they can.<br /><br />(Please note that the promo copy of the CD that has been circulating around for a while is an unmastered version, and thus does not represent the full quality of the record.

B000002GYN|5.0|For starters, I consider myself just a casual fan of the Eagles.  I, like many other millions of Americans, grew up listening to the famous Eagles Greatest Hits 1971-75 album.  Everybody had it.  All the songs were played on the radio too.  Because of this, I never bought the early Eagles albums, and I did not know the other songs that were on them.<br /><br />Since the remastered versions of the Eagles cd's came out around 2000, I decided to buy them and skip the greatest hits version this time.  Wow, what a pleasent surprise.  The Eagles debut is a very enjoyable listen.  Of course we're all familiar with the hits Witchy Woman, Peaceful Easy Feeling, and Take It Easy, but some of the other tracks are just as good.  I especially like Take the Devil.  If you were like me, and did not ever own or listen to the early Eagles albums, do yourself a favor and check them out.  You won't be sorry.  Even if you only consider yourself a casual fan.<br /><br />Desperado, One of These Nights, and On the Border are also recommended.

B000001ESJ|5.0|This is part two of a comprehensive four part series of Music Reviews of the Progressive Rock band Rush.  When a band has been around as long as RUSH has (30 years), their styles will change just as their clothing and hairstyles.  I group the bands second five releases into what I call their \\"Mid-Era Progressive\\" phase.  These albums include: A Farewell to Kings (1977), Hemispheres (1978), Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981) and Exit Stage Left \\"Live\\" (1981)<br /><br />A Farewell to Kings kicks off Rush's foray into full progressive rock, which began with \\"2112\\", and eventually culminates with Moving Pictures.  On Kings, Alex Lifeson continues to use more acoustic guitars.  Neil creates more interesting percussion sounds, and Geddy's bass-lines improve to some of their most distinct.  Two of the bands's most progressive tracks are included here.  Coming in at over ten minutes each, Xanadu and Cygnus X-1 are classic examples of 70's progressive hard rock. The album also contains one of Rush's all-time fan favorites: Closer to the Heart.<br /><br />A Farewell to Kings is one of my favorite Rush albums from this era and many fans put it in the top 5 of all Rush releases.  Even discerning Prog-Rock fans put this album in their Top 50 of all-time progressive rock titles.  It's only second to the ever popular Moving Pictures in ranking (currently #18).

B000002GXJ|4.0|The Eagles Live cd is and always has been a Complete Rip-Off!  Warner Brothers has been raking it in on the Eagles catalog for decades and has only continued the tradition with the remasters (see my review of Hotel California).  This is the original version from way back in 1989.  They did not have 80 minute cd's back then, only 74 minute discs.  That I understand , but this has also been remastered and released AGAIN on 2 discs!  There is absolutely NO EXCUSE for this to have been released on 2 compact discs except that it allows Warner Brothers to demand a higher 2 cd price!<br /><br />I vowed to NEVER buy this release, even though I own all the other standard Eagles remasters.  They do sound much better, so it is worth it to me.  But, you get NOTHING NEW.  Same ol' booklets, same standard gray jewel cases, etc.<br /><br />HERE's The GOOD NEWS - I just bought this at a local SAM's Club for only...$12.88.  I could not believe the price.  And, it is the newer remastered version in a standard double slim jewel case.  It says right on the back, \\"remastered by so and so at Sterling Sound 1999\\".<br /><br />I do hope that sometime in the near future, Rhino records or Universal Chronicals will put out a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of this release with more tracks from that era and fill up those 2 compact discs.  Until then...
B0000C8AVE|5.0|One of the single most important albums of the rock canon, THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN, along PLEASE PLEASE ME, introduced the 1960s with a bang. Sure, the decade had been underway since 1960, but with this release we finally get the Dylan that will change the face of popular music. Although the album before this one can be entertaining in spots, no one could guess the genius of this sophomore effort by listening to the first Bob Dylan disc. And what genius it is.     Dylan, in the course of 13 songs, covers much of the human emotional genome, from joy to sadness to longing to righteous anger to broken hearts to comedy.  The album is as accomplished and stunning as any of his later works, and stands as one of the best albums ever recorded.  The sound is sparse, but very effective for the material covered.  It also has a lesson producers nowadays could learn from: you don't need tons of instruments to produce effective music. This is just Dylan, a guitar, and a harmonica with the exception of \\"Corrina, Corrina,\\" and he makes it work. Boy does he ever.     This album produced many of his most important compositions and signature songs, including the song that broke him into the mainstream, \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\". Compositions like the aforementioned song, \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,\\" \\"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall,\\" \\"Masters of War,\\" and \\"Girl of the North Country,\\" quickly established Dylan as the premier songwriter for the social conscious of the early 1960s, a role Dylan would quickly move away from (just listen to the mid 1960s trilogy of BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME, HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED, and BLONDE ON BLONDE to see how far he left this stuff behind). However, Dylan would never cease to be the premier songwriter of rock and roll, and he is still regarded as the poet laureate of rock and roll.    What makes this album's durability all the more remarkable is that it was recorded in the height of the folk-protest revival, which had numerous songs that do not have long shelf lives. The central problem with protest albums is they have a tendency to become dated and awkward as years go by, but not here. These songs sound just as glorious as when they were first released. Where THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN does sound dated, this effect actually enhances the album, especially on the last cut of the album where he is talking to President Kennedy who was alive at the time. That alone gives the cut an endearing quality.       Dylan wisely stayed away from dated political concerns, and instead addressed the problems America was having in the 1960s from a much more universal perspective.  Instead of singing about nuclear rain (which \\"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall was never about to begin with), Dylan invokes an oncoming apocalypse.  With \\"Blowin' in the Wind,\\" he confesses he simply doesn't know the answers to the problems, a very strange thing for an early 1960s folk song to do.  Other folkies would have said the answer was social reform, or peace and love, or something along those lines.  \\"Masters of War\\" stays relevant even today, because Dylan addresses universal concerns, not topical ones.         It is useful to contrast this album with its followup, THE TIMES THEY ARE A'CHANGIN'.  THE TIMES is a much more defined album, with Dylan clearly in the \\"protest mode\\".  While most of the cuts off that record are certainly worthy additions to the Dylan catalogue (considering the stuff that was being recorded at the time by Dylan, did we really need \\"With God On Our Side,\\") when taken as an entire album THE TIMES wears its listeners out emotionally.  TIMES can get rather monotous as times as well.  TIMES has dated much more badly than FREEWHEELIN', though to be fair to that record, it still stands up much better than the other folk records coming out of the Greenwich Village scene by today's standards, especially with the title track.      That is one album that desperately needed some light-hearted moments like \\"Eternal Circle\\" or something to breakup the monotony. Sadly, two of the best compositions (\\"Percy's Song\\" and \\"Lay Down Your Weary Tune,\\" both available on BIOGRAPH) were left off.     TIMES is a dark, brooding, traditional \\"protest album\\", and though evidenced by Dylan's numerous outtakes from that period that he was writing songs far beyond simple protest music, it is obvious Dylan constricted himself to very narrow subject matter and themes.  TIMES comes off as a very humourless, serious affair.  Dylan does not make that mistake here.    While I digressed to discuss this album's followup, contrasting TIMES with FREEWHEELIN' is useful in that it helps show what makes FREEWHEELIN' so successful.  TIMES is a straight laced, no nonsense protest album, though with better track selection (like most of Dylan's work), it could have been a much different, and in TIMES' case, better, album.  Listening to TIMES is emotionally draining, and while certainly has some great songs, overall the album does not stand up as well, though there are individual songs that match anything on FREEWHEELIN'.  TIMES is much more limited in its emotional range, whereas FREEWHEELIN' is a much broader record, and a better one at that.    While THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN certainly qualifies as a protest album, due to Dylan's deft skill he crafted the album to be much more universal than strictly topical, and he has been rewarded with creating a rather timeless piece of music. While he did go radically reinvent himself several times over, Dylan never sounded better here, and while he may have come up with music as good as the songs on this album he never made one that surpassed it.
B00005JPD0|5.0|I don't recall the hype usually associated with a Denzel Washington film, when Deja Vu was released in theaters. It's possible that this film was a huge box office success and won an Academy Award, but then some secret government agency changed the past and made it appear as if Deja Vu is just a DVD hit. That's what Deja Vu is about--time travel and manipulating realities. Denzel's stellar performance made it all believable. I just can't it took two years for me to get around to viewing such a fantastic film. Or did it?
B0000C8AVM|5.0|This is Dylan's most talked-about LP from his post 1960s career, and while initially the critics were unsure about it, BLOOD ON THE TRACKS rapidly became perceived as one of the most impressive albums Dylan has cut.  The song-writing is strong and assured, and Dylan is as cryptic as ever.  Yet there also seems to be a central theme here: broken relationships.  When asked about this album's reception, Dylan said he never truly understood why people enjoy that kind of pain.    Anyone familiar with art know that some of the best art in the world comes from pain.  Bob Dylan's music from 1969 to 1974 was very much characterised by a sort of domesticity which was the central undercurrent to most of his music, being characterized by his familia lifestyle.  While the music found on these albums (NASHVILLE, SELF-PORTRAIT to some extent, NEW MORNING, and PLANET WAVES) are sometimes exciting (especially NASHVILLE, the best of the lot), generally they never quite rise to the level of the artistically impeccable.       While the domesticity was heartfelt and sincere, it seems Dylan was too content with his life to put a lot into his art.  There was no central drive like there was in the early days, when Dylan wanted to be the next Woody Guthrie, and then the more poetic direction of the mid 1960s, and then a more mellow country direction.  Dylan was too interested in pursuing this path to make us care about the music found on NEW MORNING, etc.  Now, however, he must channel that pain through into his art so he can deal with it.  There's a real passion here that's lacking in the other albums of this period.  This is the culmination of his mellow period, driving Dylan to an artistic catharsis because of a new ingredient in the mix of domestic bliss: pain.    This is the reason why BLOOD ON THE TRACKS stands as one of Dylan's most impressive LPs.     However, there is a common misconception about BLOOD.  These very painful songs are oft attributed to Dylan's crumbling marriage.  Asother reviews have noted, Dylan has stated that this is not a tribute to his rapidly disintegrating marriage to Sara Lowndes.  An artist can use something in their life as a springboard for their art, writing not really about the situation but using the situation as their inspiration to create art.  This may be difficult to understand, and the only reason I believe this is because I also write and I have also experienced this phenomena, which is difficult to understand but I assure you it does exist.  So, BLOOD is not about his crumbling marriage, yet paradoxically it is.     Many of Dylan's albums have a central song which all the others can relate too, or you can base your understanding of that album from that one song.  This is most clearly evident on BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, as this track will not only help you understand BLOOD, but also the influence of the painters on Dylan.  There is also a key song to which you base your understanding on: Tangled Up in Blue.  This track approaches a situation from multiple points of view (povs) and chronologically is all over the map.  The past, present, and future merge into one central mass of experience in which time does not have any distinction.  The rest of the album takes its cue from this one song, playing almost like a concept album about pain in human relationships between the sexes.    BLOOD ON THE TRACKS becomes a cubist affair, and \\"Tangled\\" gives you the direction in which you need to direct your attention if you really want to understand BLOOD.  BLOOD is about Dylan's relationships with the women in his life, and while all of them are about Sara, one is specifically about Elsie who he was seeing when he cut this album (\\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome\\"), and yet even that's about Sara, and yet, as I will discuss later, it is not about Sara at all.  But this album records various elements of their relationships at various times, floating on the lake of time rather than swimming in it as most narratives do. This facet of BLOOD shows the influence the painters have had on Dylan, and also brings a great amount of complexity to BLOOD which would otherwise be lacking.    This understanding also helps better ease \\"Jack of Hearts\\" into its proper place on the album, telling a dense allegory in the old West which is just as relevant to Dylan's pain as the rest of this is.  Although some have looked at this track with disdain, to me it's one of the best tracks on this album and if you get it, this song fits in perfectly.    A lot of BLOOD tracks were cut in 1974.  About half the original cuts were deleted from this album and rerecorded.  Dylan cops out here, with the single exception of \\"Idiot Wind,\\" which benefits from being recut while the others do not.  The original tracks betrayed to much of the pain he was going through.  BLOOD ON THE TRACKS is remarkable in that it should feel very disjointed, with half of the album cut with Dylan being emotionally bare and honest, and with the other half Dylan purposefully distances himself from the previous version and yet somehow this album has a cohesion which I can't explain.  The most dramatic difference in these versions is \\"Idiot Wind,\\" which originally Dylan sang as an sad, resigned tirade, full of pain and sorrow, and yet the released version is marked with a very real and savage sense of anger.  The anger is directed at the woman to begin with, but by the end of the song the anger is also directed against the narrator himself.  Dylan's honesty is polluted and the pain is a little more well hidden, and yet paradoxically this doesn't really matter.    BLOOD is full of paradoxes.  It is about his marriage and it isn't, there's a cohesion there which shouldn't be, it is a concept album and yet it isn't.    Anyway you look at it, BLOOD is one of Dylan's must interesting albums, and also one of his best, if not the best .

B0000C8AV3|4.0|INFIDELS, Bob Dylan's 22nd studio album, was released in 1983 to largely enthusiastic reviews and critical response.  The album was noted both for its strong, secular (!!) songwriting, and for its production which gave the songs a nice, clean sound.  Mark Knopfler and Dylan gave INFIDELS a very tasteful, rather modern production, and sounds akin to Dire Straits' music, which isn't surprising.  While not a phenomenal seller, INFIDELS did sell fairly well, however, and a lot of his fans were rather glad to see him backing away from the explicit Christianity he had been spouting for the last several years.  While he never publicly renounced his Christian faith, it is true that, starting with Infidels, his song writing would never again be so open and so poignant about the Christian faith.<br /><br />When he converted to Christianity in 1978, the public was both shocked and dismayed.  Of all people, Dylan is now a professing Christian?  Though much of the music in the early 1960s used the Bible as a reference point and moral compass, still his fan base was not receptive to him becoming a Christian.  Then in the early 1980s, he only sang his Christian material and went on long tirades about his faith in concert.  But this would only last for a few years.  By 1983, Dylan was in was a strange place, both spiritually and professionally. He had just finished recording his Christian trilogy, where he was explicitly espousing the Christian doctrine (gotta serve somebody, after all).  He took up with some Hassidic Jews, had his picture taken at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, and while not giving up his Christian faith, was still intent on keeping his Jewish roots alive.  When the time came to record a new album, the music he wrote was no longer blatantly Christian, and ever since has distance himself from organized religion.  [This however bears closer examination]<br /><br />INFIDELS marks his return to (apparently) overtly secular music.  This is the first secular music he had recorded since 1978's STREET LEGAL (though SHOT OF LOVE from 1981 had some secular songs as well).  INFIDELS was greeted rather enthusiastically, largely because he was no longer singing Christian music, at least on the surface.  Upon closer examination, however, we just see Dylan was more intent on [camouflaging his faith more.] making his faith a natural, background feature of the music, not the dominant, and sometimes overpowering, focus of his art.<br /><br />Starting with \\"Jokerman\\" and ending with \\"Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight,\\" the album is rife with both Christian allusions and also steeped in Judaism as well.  \\"Jokerman\\" has over thirty Biblical references as well.  \\"Man of Peace\\" is easily the most identifiable Christian song, discussing the Anti-Christ and the End Times.  \\"Sweetheart Like You\\" alludes to heaven and the streets of gold.  While no longer singing only Christian songs, both Jesus, The Bible, and Jewish culture would continue to inform and be a major part of Dylan's work.<br /><br />INFIDELS was also his most varied album in terms of subject matter in quite a number of years, ranging from pro-Israel foreign policy (\\"Neighborhood Bully\\"), comments on the downfall of unions (\\"Union Sundown\\"), intense, richly symbolic allegory (\\"Jokerman\\"), and gender relation comments (\\"I and I\\" and \\"Sweetheart like You\\").  The Israel song was the most explicitly political song he had written in years.  Many critics were also rather surprised at the hostility Dylan displays toward space travel, almost to the point of it being an irrational fear.  Some found \\"Neighhood Bully\\" rather crude and not that eloquent for getting Dylan's point across.  \\"Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight,\\" a lover's plea, stands as one of Dylan's most heart felt moments on record.<br /><br />Dylan's faith has always been a matter of interest to much of his audience.  From the earliest part of his career in the early 1960s to 2006's MODERN TIMES, there's always been a strong, Jewish-Christian idea of morality running as one of the main undercurrents of his work, and INFIDELS, like JOHN WESLEY HARDING, has very strong ties to both Christainity and Jewish faith.<br /><br />Naturally, the fact that INFIDELS is his secular return after three Christian albums is rather ironic.  Dylan, being the musical genius that he is, rather than making his faith the most dominant thing about his music, instead went back to using it as the foundation and well-spring for his muse.  Imagine his art as a forest.  Christian and Jewish themes, present from the beginning in his work, come out of the forest and into a clearing, and Dylan put them on prominent display.  With INFIDELS, he sends these elements of his work back into the forest of his art, still present, just not the only thing he wishes to portray.<br /><br />Bob Dylan's faith is always present in his music, just not so explicitly drawn as on the Christian trilogy.  Due to events as late as the recent concerts of the Neverending Tour, I personally believe Dylan still believes in Jesus, but just does not want to be pigeon holed and labelled.  In 1997 when TIME came out, Dylan said in an interview that when it came to religion and philosophy, he learned his faith not from preachers and books but from the songs, and that's where he feels the most alive spiritual.<br /><br />This review has dealt mostly with the religious and faith elements of Dylan's music, which is a discussion that can easily be book-length.  One more thing should also be said of INFIDELS, that does not form part of that discussion.<br /><br />The album is rather infamous among fans and critics for what the Dylan cut from the final sequence.  The album as it stands has a nice flow and overall is a good album, but for many not a great one.  Dylan deleted some of the strongest material from the sessions from the final running order, much to the horror of his fan base.<br /><br />He recorded several songs that did not make the final cut.  These are \\"Lord Protect My Child\\" \\"Tell Me\\", \\"Julius and Ethel\\", \\"Foot of Pride\\", \\"Blind Willie McTell\\", \\"Someone's Got A Hold of My Heart\\", \\"This Was My Love\\" (a cover), \\"Angel Flying to Close To The Ground\\" (a Willie Nelson song that was issued as a b-side on the Jokerman single), \\"Clean Cut Kid\\", \\"Death Is Not the End,\\" and two instrumentals, \\"Dark Groove\\" and \\"Don't Fly Unless It is Safe\\".<br /><br />Dylan would later revisit \\"Someone\\", \\"Clean Cut Kid\\", and \\"Death\\" on later albums.  \\"Blind Wille\\" has become one of Dylan's most legendary outtakes, and for good reason.  It's an amazing song.  \\"Foot of Pride\\" is another Biblical epic that's a lyrical tour de force.  \\"Julius and Ethel\\", about the Rosenbergs, is a great outtake would fit in well with INFIDELS as a protest song and has not been released to this day.  \\"Lord Protect My Child\\" is a prayer, and \\"Tell Me\\" sounds like some of the more average songs that did make the album.  There is also an electric version of \\"Blind Willie\\", much different than the officially issued take, that is rather fun to listen, though the BOOTLEG version is by far the most masterful and best take of that particular song.<br /><br />Overall, several of these outtakes are as good, and in a few instances much better, than material that made the album.  The album should have been made longer to include more of this material (it's only a little over 40 minutes), or even make it a double LP.<br /><br />As for the cuts that did not make this album, I do concur that this is INFIDELS' single greatest weakness. The still unreleased \\"Julius and Ethel\\" is an excellent song, and the songs from THE BOOTLEG SERIES, especially \\"Foot of Pride\\" and \\"Blind Willie McTell,\\" should have been definitely included on this album. All are excellent songs, and \\"Foot of Pride\\" especially ties into the Biblical imagery that runs throughout the album.

You won't be sorry!
B0000C8AV2|4.0|When OH MERCY came out in 1989, it was largely hailed as the second coming (or third, or fourth, but whose counting?) of Bob Dylan.  But does it really stand up to the heaps of praise so many people were anxious to bestow upon the record?  Well, first let's examine why the critics were so pleased by the record.  A little bit of history is required to understand this album's critical reception    By 1989, when OH MERCY was released, a lot of people had given up on Dylan.  Ever since 1983 with Infidels, a decent enough record but one marred by deleting the best tracks recorded at the sessions, Dylan floundered in a wasteland of rather bizarre, very dated production techniques and some just atrocious records.  The overall critical consensus (one that I disagree with), finds the 1985 EMPIRE BURLESQUE a poor release.  Personally, I think EB is a great record.  KNOCKED OUT LOAD, DOWN IN THE GROOVE, and the live DYLAN & THE DEAD were all panned, and for good reason.  The Dylan/Dead tour of 1987 was also lambasted by critics and fans alike.  The shows where so shambling and Dylan and the Dead so out of it that they were barely listenable.  Dylan was at his all time lowest professionally.    In steps Daniel Lanios of U2 fame.  He is known for atmospheric, moody music, and, like Phil Spector, has a very definitive \\"sound\\" that he brings to all his projects, regardless of the artist.  While Dylan would later on express dissatisfaction with Lanois's sound on their second collaboration, TIME OUT OF MIND, Lanois made Dylan's music sound artier and more sharply produced than it had been in decades.  While the previous two studio albums had a song selection that appeared to be picked at random from several different recording sessions with different bands for each session, OH MERCY was sharp, focused, and had a cohesive feel to it that KNOCKED and DOWN were severely lacking.  OH MERCY actually sounds like an album, not songs randomly picked out from different sessions spread over several years.    While Lanois helped hone the music, Dylan also rediscovered his flair for words.  While he never really lost that, Dylan once again decided to prominently display his poetic gifts, and to grand display. Dylan's lyrics sound focused and forceful, singing with conviction about politics, Israel, two relationship songs and one questioning the narrator's self-worth. The rest of the material stands out as well, proving Dylan's inspiration could still ring true.  \\"Most of the Time\\" is an especially devastating love song gone ary, and lyrically, though not sonically, sounds like it is cut of the same clothe as BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.  Indeed, \\"Most of the Time\\" sounds like the narrators of Blood aged several years.    My complaints are three. I personally think the placement of \\"Disease of Conceit\\" ruins the running order of this, with songs 7, 8, and 9 being, at least to me, being of the same type and something of a song cycle with the mood they create. It should have been placed before \\"Most of the Time\\", which stands as one of Dylan's best \\"painful\\" songs.  \\"Shooting Star\\" has a special place in my heart, it being the one Dylan song I knew back in the 1980s and 1990s, or at least was aware of it somehow. Vaguely.        As with any Dylan album, what was left OFF the album is often as revealing as what was put onto it.  Dylan recorded several strong songs that, for whatever reason, he chose to cut from the final running order.  The first two songs are \\"Dignity\\" and \\"Series of Dreams\\".  Lanois wanted to open the record with \\"Series of Dreams\\", but Dylan disagreed.  Dylan released a radically remixed version of \\"Dignity\\", remixed by Brendan O'Brien of grunge fame (produced most of Pearl Jam's work), in 1994 on his third greatest hits.  The original version produced by Lanios, which Dylan did not like and would not release on OH MERCY, would appear on the 1997 soundtrack of the smash show \\"Touched by an Angel\\".  Dylan has always displayed some strange choices on what he left off his albums.  Listen to THE BOOTLEG SERIES VOL. 1-3. Most of that stuff should have been issued on the appropriate album, and both \\"Dignity\\" and \\"Series of Drams\\" should have been included on this. But as another reviewer said, if Dylan wasn't willful and perverse he wouldn't be Dylan. Self Portrait stands as apt evidence for that phenomenon.    There were two additional songs, all of which would appear on Dylan's next album, that were written and recorded for OH MERCY but not released on that album.  These were \\"God Knows,\\" \\"Born in Time\\", songs which, especially the later, are as strong as anything that made the final cut.  Unlike the other two songs, \\"God Knows\\" and \\"Born in Time\\" were released on the 1990 effort \\"Under the Red Sky\\", making up for their omission from OH MERCY.    Lanois and Dylan work well together, although this feels like a not fully realised release when compared to their next collaboration, the masterpiece TIME OUT OF MIND. OH MERCY pales to that, but as its own its worth four stars. Kind of like this was just something of a warmup to the real masterpiece that they still had in store. If the next release is like OH MERCY is too TIME OUT OF MIND, it will be his best album ever    In the end, is it what its cracked up to be? Yes and no. It's a good release, but not his best. It certainly was the light at the end of the 1980s tunnel. I feel that OH MERCY was so highly praised, along with THE TRAVELING WILBURYS, simply because it felt like Dylan was back from whatever funk he had been in, much like the critical reaction to NEW MORNING after SELF PORTRAIT.  I do feel that it, along with EMPIRE and INFIDELS, makes a strong case that the 1980s weren't as bad as everyone says for Dylan.    (Just a little note: EMPIRE BURLESQUE is just as good as this is. In fact, AMG rates EMPPIRE BURLESQUE 4 & 1/2 stars while this only merits 3.    Also, outtakes to all but \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\" and \\"Disease of Conceit\\" are circulating.  Some feature different lyrics, and I actually like the outtake version of \\"Political World\\" better than the released version. An alternate version of \\"Most of the Time\\" was released in 1990 on a promotional EP)

B0000C8AVX|5.0|BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME is Dylan's fifth album, released in 1965. Commonly regarded as one of the most influential albums in rock history, BIABH is one of Dylan's most famous albums, and also one of his best.<br /><br />By 1965, Bob Dylan had released four albums in the space of three years. The first was a traditional folk album with only two original songs. This was the proving grounds, for the market Dylan aiming for focused mostly on traditional material, not new song-writing The second was Dylan the song-writer, and proved to be one of the 1960s' most important albums. The third, Times They Are, featured Dylan the protest singer. The fourth was Another Side, which moved away from the protest-folk sing to a more surreal method of songwriting. For the protest-movement, it appeared for certain they were about to lose Dylan as a member of the movement.<br /><br />When Dylan released BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME, he made it quite clear that not only was he distancing himself from the whole protest-folk movement, he was plugging in and turning on. While in ensuing years this decision has become the stuff of rock and roll legend and mythology, it should be noted this was a tremendously risky direction at the time. If Dylan didn't have the material to back his decision, he could fall flat on his face and his career could be over. Dylan was making a gamble that he could transition to a new fanbase - a very difficult move to pull off for any pop star. Fortunately, Dylan not only had the songs to back his decision, he crafted some of the most enduring music in rock history.<br /><br />Dylan went electric on this album, but only for half of it, leaving the second half as acoustic. Though it appears Dylan was hedging his bets by doing half electric/half acoustic, the acoustic set is so masterful and so far beyond what anyone else was writing at the time, it works. This would be the last solely acoustic songs that Dylan would record for a studio album for over twenty seven years. Ironically, the acoustic songs are some of the best of Dylan's career, and in several ways outshine the electric half, though the electric songs got more attention when initially released.<br /><br />Starting with \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" and ending with \\"It's All Over Now Baby Blue\\", Dylan opened the floodgates of his genius. All eleven songs are expertly crafted, and BIABH features some of the best lyrics in rock music. For this listener, of all Dylan's albums this is the one that most likens back to Dylan's beat heros. As I am a beat fan myself, I tend to look at this album rather fondly.<br /><br />Before we address the songs, like any Dylan album, there are a number of outtakes, some of which match the songs that made the cut. \\"Farewell Angelina\\" came as a shock when it was released in the BOOTLEG SERIES. A well known song from Joan Baez (who made it the title cut of her 1965 album), scholars and fans did not think he had recorded the song. Not only that, the BOOTLEG SERIES recording featured previously unknown verses. This is undoubtly a major song, and should have been included on the acoustic side. \\"If You Gotta Go\\" would have fit in well on the electric side. \\"I'll Keep It With Mine\\" for me is not only of Dylan's best outtakes, but one of his best songs from the 1960s, and, like \\"Farewell Angelina\\", should have been included on this album. Instead, he gave it to Nico to record of Velvet Underground fame.<br /><br />\\"Sub. Homesick Blues\\" is a whole litany of catch phases. Indeed, one of the radical leftist organizations took their name from the song, calling themselves The Weathermen. The song is notable for its lyrical amalgamation of Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, with some allusions to \\"Notes from the Underground\\" from Fyodor Dostoevsky. While not a member of the original Beats, and lyrically entirely Dylan's own work, the Beat Movement looms heavy on Sub. Homesick Blues, and indeed all of this album in particular. The song is notable for having no chorus (a rare thing for songs in those days) and one of the very first (if not the first) music video ever shot. Ginsberg is in the video (three videos were actually shot by D. A. Pennebaker, who directed \\"Dont Look Back\\"), and Subterranean may be in reference to Keroac's novel from 1958, The Subterraneans.<br /><br />\\"She Belongs to You\\" and \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" are love songs the way only Dylan could write them. \\"Love Minus Zero\\" is one of the few noted instances where Dylan said he wrote the title long before the actual lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Maggie's Farm\\" is a tell-off to the protest music movement, with Dylan getting bored with the whole thing (or least, that's how it is commonly interpreted). Taking the song on, away from that context, it stands as a young person moving away from tradition and authority to make his or her own way in this world, and to hell with working for slavemasters. This is the song that famously began the electric/folk controversery that enveloped Dylan's entire career at this point. He opened the Newport Festivel with this song (this recording now available on BOOTLEG SERIES VII), featuring Mike Bloomfield on electric guitar, and tore the song up, playing a much faster version than on the album. Being the Folk Festivel, this was very controversial, with Peter Seger famously trying to chop the sound system cables with an ax during his set.<br /><br />\\"Outlaw Blues\\" and \\"On the Road\\" are rather comic vignettes, especially the latter. While entertaining, they are the most minor.<br /><br />\\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" is Dylan's humour on full display. While rather easy to overlook given the serious nature of some of Dylan's other songs on this album, this song is a lyrically sharp, hilarious recount of sailors discovering America, replete with literary, cultural, and historical references and a sharp acerbic wit. In fact, when they were recording the song, the first take broke down due to producer Tom Wilson cracking up. Dylan gotsuch a kick out of it he left this first aborted take (about thirty seconds, including the laugh) that he left it on the record.<br /><br />Then we get to the acoustic side. While it would be easy to be disappointed that Dylan didn't record a full fledge rock album, rather than half-acoustic half electric, it simply isn't possible given the incredible song writing. These four songs, \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" \\"Gates of Eden,\\" \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,\\" are staples in the Dylan songbook. While \\"Gates of Eden\\" is not as renowned as the other three, it still stands proudly as among some of Dylan's most searing, abstract work.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", first cut with Ramblin' Jack Eliot for ANOTHER SIDE but left off that album (now available on BOOTLEG 7), was rerecorded for this, resulting in one of Dylan's most famous (justifiably so) songs of his entire career. The wordplay is intricate and startling. The song is also famous for The Byrds' rendition of it. (Oddly enough, only Roger McGuinn is on the actual Byrds recording - the rest were session players). Urban legend states that one night in a bar in the late 1960s or early 1970s, Kieth Richards, Mick Jagger, and Dylan got in a fight, because Dylan said he could have written \\"Satisfaction\\", but the Stones could never have written \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". I agree.<br /><br />\\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding\\" is the culmination of his protest writing. In this song, Dylan moves from the topical song-writing to more abstract, universal imagery and protesting, and with absolutely stunning results. This, for my money, is the ultimate protest song, and will be just as valid now as it was when it was written decades ago. What makes the songs Sub. Homesick Blues and \\"It's Alright Maw\\" so successful are, unlike his earlier protest songs, Dylan has a lot of social commentary on the tracks, but says it in such a surreal way as to not date the songs, and make them much more universal and broader in scope.<br /><br />\\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" signals the end of a relationship, and it is a song of devastating power and beauty. For those who held out hope Dylan would come back into the fold, this song made it perfectly clear what direction Dylan was to pursue.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is one of Dylan's best albums. As it is the first installment in what is commonly referred to as his electric trilogy from the mid 1960s, it has every right to be considered legendary. One of the most essential records of the 1960s, and easily one of Dylan's best. Buy it with no regrets.<br /><br />*The following outtakes were recorded: \\"California\\" (early version of \\"Outlaw Blues), \\"Farewell Angelina,\\" \\"If You Gotta Go, Go Now (Or Else You Gotta Stay All Night)\\", \\"You Don't Have to Do That (titled \\"Bending Down on My Stomick Lookin' West\\")\\", \\"Sitting on a Barb-Wire fence,\\" and \\"I'll Keep It With Mine\\". On the BOOTLEG SERIES 1-3 all of these were released, with the exception of California and You Don't Have to Do That, and the version of Sitting is drawn from the HW61 sessions.<br />.<br />.<br />-----<br />Bonus Content to Review: A long lost 60s review from a very opinated folk singer, April 30, 2001<br />[This is a reaction of a very traditional folk musician to Dylan's first electric album, which was somehow mislaid for years. I'm an anthropologist: THESE ARE NOT MY OPINIONS!]<br /><br />Can you imagine my shock when, getting Dylan's newest lp, I slipped it onto the turntable and set down to prepare myself. Dylan's lp from last year, THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN', was a rather intense album, full of protest and venom, and so I was preparing this album to be just as radical as that was. And do you know what I heard???<br /><br />Electric guitar.<br /><br />Terrible, I know. Dylan, who might have been the next Woody Guthrie, has turned his back on the people that made him big. His skill's phenomenal, and while the first album, BOB DYLAN, is a nice little folk record, it's the latter efforts that are consistently stunning. THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN has so many anthems it makes your head twirl, and THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' is an album full of protest at this world. That's what Dylan does best - protest songs. He squanders his talents when he invests them in this pop drivel. ANOTHER SIDE OF BOB DYLAN, although tremendous in its own way, should have been taken as a warning. Here we find Dylan moving away from the protest songs that our generation so needs. While, as folk music, it does have its qualities, Dylan is abandoning his strengths when people need him the most. Yet, sadly, nothing else equals in talent or conviction of writing. That illustrates what a shame Dylan has become. But while ANOTHER SIDE does have the already cited faults, it stands as a worthy addition to Dylan's catalogue.<br /><br />Now we have this ramble-shack of an album. After finally making it through the first three songs, I had to take a break because of the whole shock. Yes, I must confess, for this review I did listen to the entire album. The first side's that damned electric rock. Dylan's become the epitome of the crossover. He's a traitor. The two worst compositions are the opening track and a song called \\"Maggie's Farm\\". \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" starts this album off, and as soon as you hear that you know this album has serious problems. Its fast-spoken lyrics that go by in a blur, leaving you in a daze. This type of material (fast beat, fast lyric recitation) will never become a significant part of this culture, or if it does it shows the deterioration that we have allowed instead of standing up to the problems, just like Dylan himself urged us just two albums ago. The rest of Side 1 is just more of this drivel, but the most troubling is \\"Maggie's Farm\\". Here, he essentially argues for the demolition of the music that he once stood for. He essentially states he won't sing folk. Instead, he'll become a turncoat. This is a grievous blow to our side, for, regardless of what this album may indicate, he does have tremendous talent. For those of you who liked his absurd sense of humour, evidenced on FREEWHEELIN' and ANOTHER SIDE, there is one track called BOB DYLAN'S 115 DREAM, which is funny, but beware because it still has that electric guitar.<br /><br />Side 2, opening with \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", just keeps the pace of this abysmal album. Side 2 is acoustic music, but don't get your hopes up. This is not the Dylan that we hoped. This is Dylan doing what the \\"high culture\\" deems as poetry. He basically uses random imagery strung together for senseless effects. \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", although bad, cannot equal the absurdity of the following Dylan composition called \\"Gates of Eden\\". To quote some portions of the song (please don't cringe to bad), I will show you what I mean.<br /><br />\\"The motorcycle black madonna -- Two-wheeled gypsy queen -- And her silver-studded phantom cause -- The gray flannel dwarf to scream -- As he weeps to wicked birds of prey -- Who pick up on his bread crumb sins -- And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden\\".<br /><br />Remember, these terrible lyrics are coming from the same man who wrote this:<br /><br />\\"Come gather 'round people -- Wherever you roam -- And admit that the waters -- Around you have grown -- And accept it that soon -- You'll be drenched to the bone. -- If your time to Is worth savin' -- Then you better start swimmin' -- Or you'll sink like a stone -- For the times they are a-changin'.\\"<br /><br />As you can tell, the later is obviously superiour. We have clear cut meaning, well within the confines of traditional folk. \\"It's Alright Ma, (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" shows promise of us getting the old Dylan back, but then these hopes are crushed with \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\". Some may interpret that it just means he got this out of his system, but I fear that is not the case.<br /><br />We should have realised what was happening when ANOTHER SIDE OF BOB DYLAN was released. Dylan deliberately abused his talent, and while ANOTHER SIDE in and of itself is not as troubling, it has planted the seed. I urge you all to not buy this lp. Tell your friends to stay as far away from it as possible. If there is enough of a public reaction, Dylan will come to his senses and become the good little folky he's supposed to be. He has so much talent he must not abuse it like he has done on this. Its just a misstep (a terrible one, granted), and the results are this mess of an album. With enough of a public reaction, his next album will be a gentle folk album. He daren't cross us again so defiantly. You know what to do. If he doesn't straighten up this lp will be the end of his career. Let's pray and hope he comes back into the fold.
B000002G7G|4.0|High proportion of the tracks on eponymous Velvet Underground long-player cd are good ones.  Worth buying for 'I'm Beginning to See The Light'.  Even without Nico, the ballards are impressive with the male voices on the album.  Check out the first bars of the album tracks on Amazon if you're familiar from 40 years ago with the group.  You'll hear the tracks are good'uns. You might want to buy this 2nd time around. Best wishes, Andrew.
B0009MAP9A|4.0|Dylan's third studio album, THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' continues in the protest vein of its predecessor, FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN, but with a much more narrow focus.  With FREEWHEELIN', Dylan did record protest music, but there was much more to that record than just straight protest, and what protest there was operated on a much more universal level than the run-of-the-mill protest songs of the day.    Not so with this record.  When Dylan recorded THE TIMES in 1964, he decided to focus solely on the protest music genre of the 1960s.  While much of the music is memorable, because of the narrow constraints Dylan imposed upon himself, THE TIMES has become more dated than any other reason in Dylan's career.  And because it is so protest heavy, the album gets monotonous and just depressing to listen to in large quantities (just like the New York version of BLOOD ON THE TRACKS).  Listening to the album straight through is very emotionally draining  Taken in small doses, though, it's doable.      In the early days of the rock industry, the focus was much more on singles and EPs than full length albums.  Bands like The Beatles and Led Zeppelin and their contemporaries are largely credited from moving the musical industry of the early and mid 1960s move away from singles to albums as the dominant art form.  They helped make the albums indivisible and consolidated, with a natural ebb and flow, instead of sounding like a collection of singles with filler thrown in between.     While Zeppelin and The Beatles are the most renowned for this movement toward albums in general, along with jazz musicians, Dylan beat both bands several years to the punch.  All of Dylan's albums have a distinct atmosphere and sound that he is creating, even his critically panned albums.    With TIMES, he is going for a stark, world-gone-wrong feel that dominates the entire record.  Because of its heavy content, TIMES stands as Dylan's most depressing and emotionally draining album by far.  While his other acoustic records certainly have a world-weariness and a focus on protest sentiment, they are also very humour at times, and filled with a vibrancy and life that TIMES is simply lacking.  Now, only the deep morose of a world gone wrong stands out.      TMES is also unique because it appears that Dylan enrolled in the Phil Ochs school of songwriting, pulling his material directly from newspaper articles.  Songs like \\"Pawn in Their Game,\\" \\"With God On Our Side,\\" \\"Lonesome Death of Hattie Carol,\\" and \\"North Country Blues\\" all sound very much like relics of their time.  While I always personally enjoyed \\"Pawn in their Game\\" due to Dylan's intricate word play, the song had become dated.  While \\"With God on Our Side\\" has a universal message, Dylan focuses a large portion of the song on the early 1960s Cold War conflict between Russia and the United States, thus making the song dated in ways the FREEWHEELIN' song \\"Masters of War\\" will never be.      The title cut, justly one of Dylan's most famous songs, sounds simply like a made to order protest song.  In 1963, before the song was recorded, Dylan's friend Tony Glover saw the early manuscript of the song, and read the lines \\"come senators, congressmen, please heed the call\\".  Glover reportedly asked Dylan: \\"What is this s---, man?\\"  Dylan's answer: \\"Well, you know, it seems to be what the people like to hear\\".  The song sounds like a rather self-conscious attempt at a grand statement, and the spiritual sequel or successor to \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\".  \\"Things Have Changed,\\" Dylan's Oscar winning song from the Wonderboys soundtrack of 2000 is in many ways an answer to this song.  Even though the song sounds forced, Dylan was at the height of his powers during the 1960s, and the title cut is one of his strongest songs.  Just goes to show that when an artist of Dylan's calibre writes made-to-order music, he can still come up with fantastic material.  Just look at Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel.    \\"Lonesome Death of Hattie Caroll,\\" much like DESIRE's \\"Hurricane\\", has Dylan protesting social injustice with a memorable melody, strong lyrics, but unfortunately not that historically accurate.  The song is about a young Maryland man with high political and social connections randomly killing a woman who was working at a hotel he was at for a ball named Hattie Caroll by hitting her with his cane.  While William Devereux \\"Billy\\" Zantzinger (Dylan mispells his name as \\"Zanzinger\\") did get charged for manslaughter, it is generally agreed she did not die due to physical abuse.  Hattie Caroll had a medical condition of hypertension, harden arteries, high blood pressure, and an elarged heart, and though an autopsy was not performed, she probably died of a brain haemorrage caused by stress from the situation, rather than the physical assault itself.  The cane left no marks on her.  The song is a fan favorite, and Dylan has performed it in concert in recent years.    The rest of the songs are rather well done.  Dylan recycles the melody of FREEWHEELIN's \\"Girl from the North Country Fair\\" for \\"Boots of Spanish Leather\\".  Dylan, being Dylan, had stolen that melody from Martin Carthy's arrangement of the English folk song \\"Scarborough Fair\\" lifts the melody to D.  Dylan wrote \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" when a hotel denied him lodging while he was with Joan Baez do to his scruffy, hobo look.  \\"Ballad of Hollis Brown,\\" which Dylan rerecorded in the 1990s, is a fantastic, morbid song originally auditioned for FREEWHEELIN' but sequenced as the second track to great effectiveness, a stark contrast to the rather anthemic qualities of the title cut \\"Times They Are\\".    Like his debut, BOB DYLAN, THE TIMES ultimately is a rather limited snapshot of where Dylan was at artistically at the time.  Bruce Springsteen is famous for recording numerous songs during his sessions that don't make the final cut, because the material doesn't fall in line with the overall tone he is striving for.  Just like Springsteen'srecords, Dylan limits himself strictly to a specific type of music, in this instance protest music, but at this point in his career he was writing much more than protest music.  Had Dylan included some of TIMES' outtakes as supplemental songs or substituted the outtakes for songs that made the album, TIME's emotional and artistic core would be changed radically.  Had songs like \\"Lay Down Your Weary Tune,\\" \\"Percy's Song,\\" \\"Bob Dylan's New Orlean's Rage,\\" \\"Farewell,\\" \\"Hero Blues,\\" and \\"Eternal Circle\\" been included, the TIMES would be a much more versatile album instead of the straight protest record that it is.    In retrospect, TIMES remains an important album, as much for what it is not as for what it is.  Dylan would never make another album so protest oriented.  Dylan would famously move away from this direction, lyrically with his next album, and then musically as well on the his electric period.  The song that always stands out to me is \\"One Too Many Mornings\\", with this very memorable lyric of \\"Everything I'm a sayin', you can say just as good, you're right for your side and I'm right from mine\\").  Dylan famously recast that song in his \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" concert.  With this song, he is already hinting at his break from the folk scene, like his subconscious now he can't stay in the protest folk scene for long.    The last song, just like most last songs on Dylan albums, is very significant.  \\"Restless Farewell\\" stands as Dylan's own farewell to the movement that catapulted him to fame, and just like \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" is a devastating kiss off to people trying to pin Dylan down to their definition of what they want him to be. The protest movement only got Dylan for full straight album.    Ultimately, for what it is, TIMES is a great album, but not really an accurate snapshot of Dylan's art at the time.  TIMES feels like a diversion into hard-core protest music, and not really natural extension or progression of what Dylan was doing at the time. Myown thoughts are he had to go through the folk-protest movement and then go on to rock'n'roll, to go through just one more persona and then cut it away.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Hard to believe, better than the 1st album. Every songs is great. I saw them live in Charleston and was upset they played 8 new songs. After hearing the new cd, this is the best stuff i've heard in over 10 years. Better than anything by Creed (and I loved them). A ton of emotion, great vocals by Miles & insain guitars by Mark T. This band is tighter than a virgin.
B0000C8AW5|3.0|PLANET WAVES is an important album in Dylan's career, thought not necessarily an essential purchase for any one but the fans of the man.  While his best albums are undeniably important records in the pantheon of the rock canon, PLANET WAVES is not among that elite.  But first, let's review examine Dylan's history around this time.     Dylan had been fairly quiet since the late 1960s, and while he had released three albums (one, NASHVILLE SKYLINE, with a significant hit, \\"Lay Lady Lay\\") SELF PORTRAIT was seen by most as a critical blunder, and while NEW MORNING was hailed as something of a return to form, NM did not capture the wildness and overall sound of his earlier material.    The first major event occurred in 1973, when Dylan was chosen to record a soundtrack for Sam Peckinpah's film PAT GARRET & BILLY THE KID.  Not only that, he also got a part in the movie.  While the soundtrack was his first recorded work to be released since 1970's NEW MORNING, the soundtrack was largely instrumental, with only four of its ten tracks featuring Dylan singing.  Of those four songs, three of those tracks were different versions of the same song, a ballad about Billy the Kid.  The only major song to come out of the soundtrack was \\"Knocking on Heaven's Door\\", an admittedly great song.    The second major event came when Dylan announced he would be leaving Columbia Records, his label from the beginning of his career, to go to the newly formed Asylum Records.    The third major event, announced very shortly after Dylan jumped ship for Asylum, was the announcement that Bob Dylan would be embarking on his first major tour in eight years.  Not only that, Dylan would be touring with The Band, who had been his backing band (known then as The Hawks) on his legendary 1966 world tour.  By 1974, The Band's star power and renown was as vital as Dylan's, and the tour was a tremendous financial success.    Columbia's response to this turn of events was swift.  They quickly issued an album they simply and unimaginitevly named DYLAN (though it is known as A FOOL SUCH AS I in Europe), comprised primarily of NEW MORNING outtakes (seven songs), and two SELF PORTRAIT outtakes.  Most of the material was terrible, the album was panned, and  Dylan himself tried barring the record from release.  DYLAN came out a mere two months before PLANET WAVES, and commonly regarded as the worst album in the Dylan oeuvre.  Most regard the album as a revenge move by Columbia.  The songs largely sound like warmups.      Though he had two releases since his last studio album, NEW MORNING, Dylan had not recorded a full album's worth of original material since 1970, the longest interval at that time that Dylan had gone between albums.       Dylan wanted to tour behind some new material. As he would be touring with The Band, he also decided to record a new album with The Band as his studio band.  This was a major event in its own right.  For one, though his 1966 live music with The Band was legendary, and together they had recorded the famous Basement Tapes songs (several of which were huge hits for other artists and remain today among Dylan's most famous work), in 1974 the only officially released music that featured Dylan backed by the band was an obscure 1966 single that had a live version of \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\".    Another key factor that made this album so heavily anticipated by the rock community [record buying public] was, whereas in 1967 The Band was known only as Dylan's backing band, by 1974, they were a major creative force in their own right, and was as highly regarded (their stature has since been slightly diminished) as any of the other rock artists of their day.    Knowing this history, and especially knowing the Basement Tapes (bootleg or otherwise), you may go in expecting the wild, weird, Americana vibe Greil Marcus describes in his OLD, WEIRD AMERICA (a book about the basement tapes).  Naturally, The Band had been with Dylan for a good portion of his most famous music, and easily his most famous tour, and people were expecting a rather remarkable album from this legendary pairing.  And do they deliver?    Sort of.  The songs are loose and funky, but for such a famous pairing, especially as this is the first full album Dylan and The Band ever commercially released, some may find it rather disappointing.  Rather than returning to the electric sound of the mid 1960s, or the wild, exhilarating music of Big Pink's basement, Dylan instead laid down songs that are largely explorations of domestic life.  Dylan, just like the basement sessions, runs the show here.  The album does not play like a Band record from that period, who were steeped in Americana, but rather follows Dylan's artistic progression up to that point.    From 1969 to 1974, Dylan changed directions musically and lyrically from where he was at in the 1960s.  Dylan entered into his domestic period with NASHVILLE SKYLINE, playing music with a laid-back country-rock vibe largely concerned with family life, with this period culminating in the majestic BLOOD ON THE TRACKS in 1975.  The albums from this period are individual snapshots of his homelife, or matters closely concerned with the plain, everyday living, as opposed to the high poetic output of his earlier LPs.      PLANET WAVES is a natural building block in that road. What is important about PLANET WAVES is there is an underlying tension throughout the entire album, where Dylan is torn both artistically and in his homelife.    Unlike NEW MORNING, where he seemed positively happy with his home life (which was probably just an illusion, trying to convince himself he was happy), PLANET WAVES shows the edges fraying.  Dylan's no longer quite so sure he has really found happiness, but is willing to fight for it.  He has the almost hymn like ode to his children (two takes of \\"Forever Young\\", the first being the most famous).  But his love life, however, indicates there's trouble in Paradise, though he ends the album with a love song to his wife, \\"The Wedding Song.\\"     \\"The Wedding Song\\" is the most important song on the album, and squarely shows you where Dylan's head was at during the 1969-1974 period of his career.  He says it was never his intention or duty to remake the world at large, but to live a simple life and to live blessed with his wife and family.  But he knows his domestic situation is unstable and fragile, and can easily far apart if not handled very carefully.  \\"The Wedding Song\\" is as much Dylan convincing himself that his wife is an extremely integral part of his life and they must not part as it is a love song, and you can feel that tension of Dylan trying to maintain his family life under such intense fame and scrutiny.    PLANET WAVES signals the beginning of the end of his domestic period.  Even though Dylan was trying to convince himself he needed Sara, and she was his other half, the marriage was on the rocks, and it probably didn't help he was going on tour with The Band, as rock tours are notoriously wild.  Dylan's domestic period would ultimately end with BLOOD, and never again would he so openly extol and seek out a normal family life as he did in the 1969-1975 period. While not necessarily Dylan's greatest music, for those wanting to learn more about BLOOD, listen to the 1969-1974 batch of records.    Just like so much of Dylan's career output, while his records are fascinating listens in themselves, they're easier to understand when you know them in the context of his life and artistic direction at the time.  PW, in this particular era of Dylan, plays like the last chapter before the climax arrives in a novel.  The themes, the pain, the desperate search for resolution and peace so evident in BLOOD are all foreshadowed here on this album.  While not necessarily Dylan's greatest music, for those wanting to learn more about BLOOD, listen to the 1969-1974 batch of records    Ultimately, PLANET WAVES is more interesting in context of Dylan's life and career and how he was on the road that led him to his divorce masterpiece BLOOD, than for music itself.  While his best albums stand as great music in itself, PW does not hold together that well.  For fans looking for more of the Basement Tapes vibe, they will be disappointed.  For the average Dylan fan, he'll found some good music and a couple of great songs, but overall as an album nothing that stands up against his best records.     Bottom line: fascinating in terms of his artistic evolution, but otherwise just a middle-of-the-road album of Dylan.  Not especially great, but not bad either.
B000VD5I94|4.0|The Blu-Ray transfer of Robocop was little better than my DVD, and it had far fewer bonus materials (only the trailer, as a matter of fact, not even director's or actors' commentaries). For whatever reason, the Blu-Ray release is the R-rated theatrical release, not the director's cut that Criterion released.    Picture quality for the Bulletproof Monk preview on this disk was far better than the feature. Robocop is a 20-year-old film but it deserves the best possible transfer to an HD medium. If Sony is relying on high-quality HD releases to sell Blu-Ray, they'd better not use Robocop for the picture.    They'd best not use it for the audio, either. Extreme low bass is missing and surround treatment is virtually non existent. All in all, this looks like a release rushed out (a year after it was originally scheduled) to make it appear that Blu-Ray has an attractive selection of movies available. Attractive, perhaps. Well done, in this case, not.    Robocop is worthwhile watching for many reasons, not least of which are the spot-on treatment of \\"happy news\\" anchors, insipid advertisements, and the replacement of government functions by private corporations. However, if you are interested in the best treatment, go with the Criteria standard DVD release.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Bob Dylan for the last few years has been one of the most exiting artists rock has to offer.  He has written a best selling book, toured extensively, and recorded two highly regarded albums, putting him in a late career renaissance       Starting with 2001's effort, LOVE AND THEFT, and now this album, MODERN TIMES, Bob Dylan has newly occupied musical territory.  Dylan has broken new ground with both these releases.  Nothing in post-millennium rock sounds anything like these two records, and for good reason.   Bob Dylan has turned back the clock to pre-rock and roll, and recorded some of the most exiting music of his career, focusing solely on American traditional music.     Dylan came into critical acclaim with the 1997 album, TIME OUT OF MIND.  His first album of original songs in seven years, TOOM won best album of the year at the Grammies, and the first of three critically acclaimed albums.  MT has been marketed as the end of this \\"trilogy,\\" but Dylan disagrees with that assessment.  TOOM, great album that it is, sounds totally separate from L&T and MT and is an album unto itself, totally separate from the music found on the next two releases.  Dylan said MT would be the second part of a trilogy, if there is going to be one, with L&T being the first part.      When LOVE AND THEFT was released, Dylan impressed the critics and the fans a second time in a row.  L&T is a markedly different album than its predecessor, TIME OUT OF MIND, which is a much darker, aesthetically different album.  MODERN TIMES is very much a companion album to L&T, and proves the methodology behind his 2001 effort was not a one off fluke.  Dylan does a wide variety of traditional music on MT, from blues to ballads to crackerjack rock and roll to apocalyptic visions of oncoming doom.      Song for song, MT is as strong and L&T, with a few casual masterpieces.  \\"Working Man's Blues #2\\" is fantastic, some great lines.  \\"Ain't Talkin'\\", MT's last song, is not only the best song from album, butalso one of Dylan's greatest songs of the last 25 years, easily the equal of any of his 1960s output and a lyrical tour-de-force, the newest of his great story, apocalyptic story songs.    Dylan largely writes from the perspective of one who has seen it all, but keeps on trucking (like the narrator from \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\").    Both records have been tremendously successful.  MODERN TIMES went to number one on the billboard charts, Dylan's first since the 1976 album DESIRE.  Dylan is the oldest person (65 at the time), to have a number one album on the charts.  \\"Someday Baby\\" won a Grammy.    MT is largely a further exploration of Americana.  Just like its predecessor, MT is squarely rooted in pre-rock music.  Like L&T, MT sounds fresh, startling, and deeply relevant due to it being so firmly rooted in American traditional music.  There is no other musician today who makes these traditional forms so wonderfully alive, and yet so in sync with his or her own unique and musical vision as Bob Dylan does, while still making them so accessible to today's public.       Both titles are a clue to what the album is about.  L&T is Dylan's love for prerock music, and his ransacking of the forms (a sly reference to the folk tradition).  MODERN TIMES, is rather ironic, as there is nothing modern about the music itself, but the title also acknowledges, in a post modern sort of way, that the album is recorded and presented in modern times for modern audiences, and a knowing reference to Charlie Chaplan's film.    Also, Dylan has gone on interviews saying this is the best band, man for man, that he's had, which is saying a lot, as he was backed by so many great bands.  Dylan's also made several comments about how compressed the sounds are on modern records, something he had tried to stay away from.    Where L&T used early 20th musical structures and genres, Dylan wrote all the music and lyrics.  With MT, however, Dylan has turned too T. S. Eliot for advice, who famously said \\"Bad poets imitate.  Good poets steal.\\"  Working within what is known as the \\"folk tradition\\", Dylan has taken several songs from his encyclopedic knowledge of traditional music, updated either the music or the lyrics or both, and then presented the material as his own.  He has also used a few select lines from Henry Timrod, the Civil War poet.  Both the songs and Timrod are now in public domain, so the sources are not a legal issue.  Regardless, All this has caused some controversy.    First, it should be known that before copyright laws and intellectual property rights became one of the abiding legal preoccupations of the 20th and 21st century, musicians and performers largely worked within the context of an oral and written tradition, freely adapting and changing often well known material and presenting it as original work.  This goes far beyond just music as well.  This process, known within musical history as the folk tradition, has been going on in American traditional music for decades, and has also been part of rock's long and varied history as well.      However, with the entrance of rock, matters get complicated.  Intellectual property rights in the past forty to fifty years have become major legal issues.  Now, music is copyrighted and royalties get paid.  Songwriting credits determine who get paid.  Those who wrote original music want to get paid when that music is used.  While most of MT's music is modeled after other artists' songs, the credits read \\"All songs written by Bob Dylan\\".    Led Zeppelin is also famous for this type of adaptation, and was even sued by Willie Dixon in 1970 for the use of lyrics in their song \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" without him being credited.  Dixon won the lawsuit.    Bob Dylan has done this type of adaptation and musical pilfering from the very start of his career.  One of his very first original songs to be published, \\"Song to Woody\\", used the melody of Guthrie's own \\"1913 Massacre\\".  There are numerous other instances of this type of artistic pilfering in Dylan's music which for reasons of space I will not go into.  A book or scholarly paper is better suited to more fully analyses and explore this element in Dylan's music, not a review on a website.  For those curious, I include at the end of this review more info about the MT's sources.     While from a business and artistic standpoint, this adaptation and borrowing, yet not crediting the source, is rather alarming to modern audiences, it's my belief that that has what made MT and L&T resonate so well.  There is something in both records that simply strike a chord with listeners.  Dylan has always been about traditional music, and while he ventured out to record different varieties of music, the American traditional songbook has always been in the back of Dylan's mind.    What has made MT and L&T so successful is they feel like an aural history of American music before 1950.  Of all the major rock artists of the modern era, Dylan is the most versed in the rich American traditions.  American traditional music have always been the bedrock of his muse, and with L&T and MT Dylan wisely makes that the central focus of his work.  This music sounds like a time capsule, music made by an American for Americans before the advent of rock and roll.  Dylan is the most qualified of all our major rock artists to make music with this timeless, traditional feel.    Due to his own unique position in rock history, no other major musician other than Dylan has released an album with all the rich history of Americana so inherently woven in the fabric of his new music.  In all likelihood, no other artist probably could.  Dylan cut his teeth on traditional music, and he is the most able to make that music relevant again to modern audiences.    Bottom line: fantastic album.  Must buy.                          Appendix - Sources for MODERN TIMES songs:  *\\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" is an update on Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Good'.  *\\"Rolling and Tumbling\\" is a blues standard, recorded by everyone from Cream, Canned Heat, Robert Johnson, and Eric Clapton.  Muddy Waters' version is the most famous.  There are over sixty recorded versions of this song.  *\\"When the Deal Goes Down\\" uses the melody from Bing Crosby's signature song \\"When the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day\\".    *\\"Someday Baby\\" is based off a Muddy Waters song called \\"Trouble No More\\".    * \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" lifts the entire structure and melody of \\"Red Sails in the Sunset\\", written by Jimmy Kennedy and Hugh Williams in 1935.  *\\"Nettie Moore\\" lifts the title and some of its chorus though Dylan's melody and lyrics are otherwise unrecognizable.  *\\"The Levees Gonna Break\\" is a based on the blues standard \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" by Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie. Led Zeppelin reworked the song as well into their own composition, much different from Dylan's.  *\\"Aint Talkin\\" derives its chorus from the more up-tempo \\"Highway of Regret\\" by the Stanley Brothers

B0009MAP90|3.0|BOB DYLAN, like the debut LPs by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, are stunning collections of music for their perspective genre, but has long been outclassed by the band's subsequent work.  However, the album is an (imperfect) snapshot of Dylan's early days, and in its own way an important indicator of Dylan's musical roots.  Unlike The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, BOB DYLAN was recorded for a much smaller audience in mind, and sold in rather slim numbers.      The album is comprised of eleven traditional songs and two covers.  The reason was because in the early 1960s folk revival, the artists of that movement focused primarily on traditional material, they were much more concerned with interpretative songs than singing original compositions, a thing which Dylan himself would soon be changing.    In a mid 1960s review, Bob Dylan he was disgusted that all these people suddenly deciding they'd just start writing songs without any real knowledge of the traditional body of songs that have been before them. When asked about his own songwriting, Dylan said he didn't start writing his own songs until he had immersed himself in the tradition of his chosen field: songs from the American tradition.  This proved to be a very rich tradition, as Dylan has gotten a lot of great music from that musical background.  Over forty years later Dylan's newest music is a testament to this fact.     On his debut he was practicing and doing his own research in the Americana tradition to give his work much more depth than those people who just began writing songs without any sense of history behind it. That is what makes LOVE AND THEFT and MODERN TIMES so rewarding: you feel Dylan giving us a history of modern musical traditions other than rock and presenting it in a rock context.  In an interview from 2001, Dylan said that the radio made \\"hideous noises,\\" and there was none of the great musical tradition which made radio in his day so rewarding. So with LOVE AND THEFT and MODERN TIMES, Dylan gives us a study in the musical structures of the past, and instead of it being a pale imitation. LOVE AND THEFT and MODERN TIMES raises to the level of a grand artistic statement that ranks among his best work.    So why am I going on and on about an albums released decades after this release? It's because his newest music would not have been possible without Dylan steeping himself in the American musical tradition, of which this is his first studio foray.     It should be noted that when Dylan recorded this album, he was careful in what he recorded.  He said in the Scorsese biopic that he didn't want to be pinned down, and didn't want to reveal all his secrets and protect his better material from other people on his first album.  Dylan haphazardly recorded a number of songs that had been in his repertoire, but also standards in many of the of the other Greenwich Village regulars as well.        BOB DYLAN is Dylan trying to pass for a rough, gravelly voiced old singer who's been thru hell and back and lived to tell all about his adventures. Now he really is an old gravelling singer whose has a tremendous amount of experience and has actually become what he was trying to be over four decades ago.     His voice has always been one of controversy, and this is just as rough hewn as any of his releases. If you're this far into Dylan's body of work, you've come to the same conclusion that most of us have: Dylan's actually a very good singer, just not in the traditional sense. His voice adds much to these songs, giving them that edgy feel which they need to accomplish what Dylan wants them to accomplish.  Amazingly, Dylan sings these songs with a world weariness and a wise-beyond-his-years approach that should simply not b e possible for a 21 year old, which is how old he was when he recorded this.      Dylan goes through 11 standard folk songs with a faster tempo than you'd expect (the tempo gives the album that edgy, paranoia feel) and each carry the weight oftradition behind it. Dylan, in a truly skillful way, captured the sense of history that accompanies each of these songs. Each song sounds personal and very relevant to the singer himself, which is amazing because of all the death obsession prevalent on the album. Dylan was only twenty at the time this record was cut, and yet he truly made you feel he was \\"fixin' to die,\\" (which, coincidently, is more famous as the eleven minute monster on Led Zeppelin's PHYSICAL GRAFFITI) and that when he did you would need to ensure his grave was \\"kept clean.\\" In \\"Freight Train Blues,\\" Dylan holds a note for probably the longest in his career, and after he finishes you expect him to be sucking air and yet he keeps right on singing. For you Animal fans here, we have the five-minute \\"House of the Rising Sun,\\" which Dylan appropriately sings in high anguish.     And what of the two original songs? Dylan, the poet laureate of rock and roll and one if its most important songwriters, only has two original songs on his debut. For reasons already discussed, it is obvious why. \\"Talkin' New York Town\\" deals with Dylan's arrival in New York and his struggles there, and \\"Song to Woody\\" is his own tribute to Woody Guthrie, the most influential person in Dylan's young life. Each is startling.     Although this record does not point to THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN (judging from this, you could not deduce that Dylan's next lp would be one of the top albums of the 1960s), this album stands as an important introduction to Dylan and his muse. For those who want folk Dylan, I personally recommend his next three albums before turning to this. Although this is a fine LP, Dylan's body of work is large enough to make this more for the student of Dylan and music in general (which is impossible to study without a strong focus or emphasis on Dylan and his counterpart The Beatles) as opposed to the fan of Bob Dylan.      BOB DYLAN becomes much more important in retrospect than it ever did upon its original release, and without Dylan soaking himself in all these traditional songs we would never have gotten a lot of the top rate material on THE BASEMENT TAPES (official and otherwise) or LOVE AND THEFT or TIME OUT OF MIND or MODERN TIMES or much of his other material. Of his nine studio releases in the 1960s, this one should be the last on your list to buy, but for anyone who really wants to know Dylan (which is a very hard thing to do: people have built entire careers on the foundation of trying to figure him out) this is essential. Listen to this and then listen to his newest music and his live performances on the Never Ending Tour, and you can see the process which Dylan has been going through. He still covers a good number of traditional songs in his concerts.    Overall, the album is an interesting listen, but only a very limited snapshot of Dylan's early influences.  Bootlegs from this period, such as the Minnesota Tapes, the Gaslight Tapes, the Witmark Demos, and other known recordings, in conjunction with this album, give you key insight into Dylan's musical evolution and how important traditional music was, and is, to Bob Dylan's art.      As it stands, this album is a key piece to study to gain understanding of Dylan's pre-fame days, largely because it's been officially released.  There are other, much more representative albums in Dylan's early era that gives you insight into how his art evolved, but unfortunately they are mostly bootlegs.  Still, this album gets the job done in what it's trying to do, which is a folkie playing music from his repertoire to a, admittedly limited, audience for the first time.    For all you songwriters (and writers in general, for that matter) out there, take a lesson from Dylan. Study and immerse yourself in what's gone before and it will greatly broaden and enrich your own work.
B000ELJBAK|4.0|My purchase of the 2006 edition marks the third time I've purchased this album now. I bought it on LP back in the day, it was one of the very first CDs I ever purchased, and now -- the remastered edition. My rating if for the album in general -- and under-rated and under-appreciated gem is there ever was one -- than for the remaster itself. Yes, the sound is improved immensely from the the initial CD release (which I always found sort of dim and muddy-sounding), but there's not a lot of value added to the package: Slightly improved booklet (the photos from the original LP are back), but no bonus tracks. Most of the tracks have their fadeouts lengthened, but it really adds nothing. In fact, on a couple of tracks, you can see why they faded out when they did, as a bum note is struck. On the whole though, this album is, in my opinion, the finest work Gilmour has done outside of Pink Floyd (and, in fact, anything after The Wall). The mood of the album is relaxed and laid back, totally lacking in the bombast and overproduction you'll find on About Face, Momentary Lapse, and Division Bell (no sound effects, orchestras, or armies of backup musicians). It reminds me a lot, in spirit, of the first Paul McCartney album -- a low-key, homemade, unassuming affair. If you haven't gotten this album yet, this is the version to buy. If you already own it, it's a tossup as to whether it's worth buying again. The improved sound is enough to make me glad I did, but your mileage may vary.
B00026WU3M|4.0|When OH MERCY came out in 1989, it was largely hailed as the second coming (or third, or fourth, but whose counting?) of Bob Dylan.  But does it really stand up to the heaps of praise so many people were anxious to bestow upon the record?  Well, first let's examine why the critics were so pleased by the record.  A little bit of history is required to understand this album's critical reception    By 1989, when OH MERCY was released, a lot of people had given up on Dylan.  Ever since 1983 with Infidels, a decent enough record but one marred by deleting the best tracks recorded at the sessions, Dylan floundered in a wasteland of rather bizarre, very dated production techniques and some just atrocious records.  The overall critical consensus (one that I disagree with), finds the 1985 EMPIRE BURLESQUE a poor release.  Personally, I think EB is a great record.  KNOCKED OUT LOAD, DOWN IN THE GROOVE, and the live DYLAN & THE DEAD were all panned, and for good reason.  The Dylan/Dead tour of 1987 was also lambasted by critics and fans alike.  The shows where so shambling and Dylan and the Dead so out of it that they were barely listenable.  Dylan was at his all time lowest professionally.    In steps Daniel Lanios of U2 fame.  He is known for atmospheric, moody music, and, like Phil Spector, has a very definitive \\"sound\\" that he brings to all his projects, regardless of the artist.  While Dylan would later on express dissatisfaction with Lanois's sound on their second collaboration, TIME OUT OF MIND, Lanois made Dylan's music sound artier and more sharply produced than it had been in decades.  While the previous two studio albums had a song selection that appeared to be picked at random from several different recording sessions with different bands for each session, OH MERCY was sharp, focused, and had a cohesive feel to it that KNOCKED and DOWN were severely lacking.  OH MERCY actually sounds like an album, not songs randomly picked out from different sessions spread over several years.    While Lanois helped hone the music, Dylan also rediscovered his flair for words.  While he never really lost that, Dylan once again decided to prominently display his poetic gifts, and to grand display. Dylan's lyrics sound focused and forceful, singing with conviction about politics, Israel, two relationship songs and one questioning the narrator's self-worth. The rest of the material stands out as well, proving Dylan's inspiration could still ring true.  \\"Most of the Time\\" is an especially devastating love song gone ary, and lyrically, though not sonically, sounds like it is cut of the same clothe as BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.  Indeed, \\"Most of the Time\\" sounds like the narrators of Blood aged several years.    My complaints are three. I personally think the placement of \\"Disease of Conceit\\" ruins the running order of this, with songs 7, 8, and 9 being, at least to me, being of the same type and something of a song cycle with the mood they create. It should have been placed before \\"Most of the Time\\", which stands as one of Dylan's best \\"painful\\" songs.  \\"Shooting Star\\" has a special place in my heart, it being the one Dylan song I knew back in the 1980s and 1990s, or at least was aware of it somehow. Vaguely.        As with any Dylan album, what was left OFF the album is often as revealing as what was put onto it.  Dylan recorded several strong songs that, for whatever reason, he chose to cut from the final running order.  The first two songs are \\"Dignity\\" and \\"Series of Dreams\\".  Lanois wanted to open the record with \\"Series of Dreams\\", but Dylan disagreed.  Dylan released a radically remixed version of \\"Dignity\\", remixed by Brendan O'Brien of grunge fame (produced most of Pearl Jam's work), in 1994 on his third greatest hits.  The original version produced by Lanios, which Dylan did not like and would not release on OH MERCY, would appear on the 1997 soundtrack of the smash show \\"Touched by an Angel\\".  Dylan has always displayed some strange choices on what he left off his albums.  Listen to THE BOOTLEG SERIES VOL. 1-3. Most of that stuff should have been issued on the appropriate album, and both \\"Dignity\\" and \\"Series of Drams\\" should have been included on this. But as another reviewer said, if Dylan wasn't willful and perverse he wouldn't be Dylan. Self Portrait stands as apt evidence for that phenomenon.    There were two additional songs, all of which would appear on Dylan's next album, that were written and recorded for OH MERCY but not released on that album.  These were \\"God Knows,\\" \\"Born in Time\\", songs which, especially the later, are as strong as anything that made the final cut.  Unlike the other two songs, \\"God Knows\\" and \\"Born in Time\\" were released on the 1990 effort \\"Under the Red Sky\\", making up for their omission from OH MERCY.    Lanois and Dylan work well together, although this feels like a not fully realised release when compared to their next collaboration, the masterpiece TIME OUT OF MIND. OH MERCY pales to that, but as its own its worth four stars. Kind of like this was just something of a warmup to the real masterpiece that they still had in store. If the next release is like OH MERCY is too TIME OUT OF MIND, it will be his best album ever    In the end, is it what its cracked up to be? Yes and no. It's a good release, but not his best. It certainly was the light at the end of the 1980s tunnel. I feel that OH MERCY was so highly praised, along with THE TRAVELING WILBURYS, simply because it felt like Dylan was back from whatever funk he had been in, much like the critical reaction to NEW MORNING after SELF PORTRAIT.  I do feel that it, along with EMPIRE and INFIDELS, makes a strong case that the 1980s weren't as bad as everyone says for Dylan.    (Just a little note: EMPIRE BURLESQUE is just as good as this is. In fact, AMG rates EMPPIRE BURLESQUE 4 & 1/2 stars while this only merits 3.    Also, outtakes to all but \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\" and \\"Disease of Conceit\\" are circulating.  Some feature different lyrics, and I actually like the outtake version of \\"Political World\\" better than the released version. An alternate version of \\"Most of the Time\\" was released in 1990 on a promotional EP)

B000I5X81A|5.0|The mixing of J.J. Cale's (featured more than Clapton, and wrote most of the songs) laid back, folksy-bluesy style added to Clapton's tasty guitar work, along with his laid back, bluesy style (on this CD), makes for an incredible CD, an incredible mix, a beautiful blend.  Even the two voices seem to fit beautifully.  And it's about time the two got together, as J.J. Cale wrote the early Clapton hits \\"After Midnight\\" and \\"Cocaine.\\"  The best J.J. Cale (not to be confused with John Cale) CD I've heard.  Highly recommended.
B000O599WG|3.0|\\"Rio Bravo\\" is considered a classic Western by many but it's hard understand why. It's certainly unusual. The film has a \\"sitcom\\" atmosphere with \\"The Duke\\", playing the Sheriff of a border town, presiding over a bunch of second-rate actors in a light-hearted story about a bad guy and his gang of thugs trying to spring his brother from jail.<br /><br />\\"Rio Bravo\\" focuses on its characters, the rather banal plot is secondary. There is much gently comic interplay between Wayne and his deputies Walter Brennan, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson. Angie Dickenson as Wayne's love interest is merely a male fantasy though she tries her best. Dino, playing a character called \\"Dude\\", even gets an opportunity to croon a couple of western songs. Clearly this is not a film to be taken too seriously.<br /><br />If you're looking for the \\"lighter\\" side of \\"The Duke\\" then this film will be of interest. Others may be wondering what all the fuss is about. The film proceeds at a leisurely pace and draws to a pretty flat conclusion.
0375842209|5.0|I haven't been so emotionally engaged in a book in I can't remember how long.  The only fault that I find is that reviews keep saying that the target audience for this book is teens!  While I find the story and the historic significance important, I would argue that the reader who gets more out of this book is a reader who has experienced more out of life.  I loved all of the figurative language and the perspective that Zusak wrote from.  And although I was a bit annoyed that Death was a blabber-mouth, in the end it didn't take away from how I felt reading the last 80 pages of the book.  This book was our community book for 2007 (a grant provides them at no cost to anyone who wants to read one).  Everyone I've talked to has literally sobbed through the ending, feeling everything that Liesel does along the way.<br /><br />Phenomenal.  I recommend it to everyone.

B000QQFKYE|4.0|In a room where beautiful young whores languish and occasionally perform choreographed musical dance routines, David Lynch once again proves that he will take second fiddle to noone, as the head concubine to the whore goddess Diana.<br /> Lynch's sudden injection of a set of full, beautiful, \\"pretty\\" bosoms, is to keep us alert and on our toes. To sharpen the senses as the movie wanes towards its hemhorraged conclusion.<br /> Lynch loves to leave the frail minds of his viewers twisting in the breeze, as many of his re-occuring themes would indicate. But it is some of his new material which becomes the real treat in \\"Inland Empire\\".<br /> The black rabbits (those are definitely not bunnies, children) are a nice touch, and the opening sequence in which they are featured, may well be the second greatest, singular piece of cinematography ever recorded, behind only Victor Erice's capturing of a young Ana Torrent's re-action to seeing Frankenstein appear on film for the first time, in a small Castilian village, in the wake of the Spanish civil war, in the beautifully done Spanish classic, \\"The Spirit of the Beehive\\".<br /> Shot in sit-com type sequence, this morbid little tour de farce skewers the genre, in an unflinching, parodial form.<br /> The way the male rabbit enters the room to glorious applause, then proceeds to just stand there a mute, as well as the audience's outbursts of mirth at apparently dry and indescript lines of dialogue; top shelf. Then, when the one female rabbit laughs in a desperate manner, it is in direct contrast to her audience's canned amusement, priceless, and must be viewed on great dope in order to be fully appreciated, methinks.<br /> I would forever be thankful for David Lynch, if the only film he ever did was, \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\\". That was my introduction to his strange and twisted world. I was young, impressionable, and had gotten ahold of the Killah, the stuff with frosty white hairs glistening on the buds. I was transfixed, to say the least. I watched it with a couple of buddies, in this dump of a trailer we shacked in for a summer, while starving and shearing Christmas trees.<br /> It is Laura Palmer's mother who makes a re-appearance here, as a withered old seer of unknown, but seemingly Balkan, origin. Trully the stellar performance of the show. She gives Laura Dern's character the crazy eye, and the lilting grin, while making apparant small talk about psychotic jibberish, which we later find to be the profound, under-riding currents the movie is carried on. \\"A boy steps through his door into the world and notices his shadow, thus, Evil is born, and follows the boy wherever he goes.\\" Mystical wisdom for the ages.<br /> While many Polish women are elegant and charming, Lynch's spot-on portrayal of Polish men in this movie, casts them in the beastly light they so richly deserve.<br /> We get a glimpse of a take on the whole time travel theory, as represented by a silk hanky being folded and pierced through. then one looks through the hole, etc. (i.e. the Wrinkle in Time)<br /> I also found the orange-lighted lamps to be quite pleasant, something I should like to get for around the house, my ownself.<br /> And, as in all his flicks, lynch includes a greenish-brown doorway, (\\"This would look nice on your wall\\") which leads down a crooked hall, obviously the portal to his soul. Amen.to say the least.

B000TEUSJU|5.0|The CALIGULA Blu ray Imperial Edition is identical in content to the DVD edition that I reviewed last year.  There is no exclusive content on this high def release.  To call it high def isn't really correct because I don't suppose CALIGULA is ever going to look too great, even on Bluray. Nevertheless, the Bluray transfer offers a bit of an improvement over the DVD version, especially in the Alternative Version print.  The alternative footage has been re-mastered for this edition so that the footage matches the quality of the rest of the film.  This is a huge improvement over the DVD which left the \\"new\\" footage faded and dirty.  The colors of CALIGULA have never looked better than they do here although there is still an excessive amount of grain in many scenes due to the condition of the source material.  This edition includes a smaller sized version of the booklet included with the DVD edition.  Sadly, the beautiful fold out packagaing and slipcase are replaced by the cheap standard Blu ray case.  The edition is now on 2 discs instead of three.  If you love CALIGULA or collect the various video releases of this film, then this release is a must have.  It is the best CALIGULA has ever looked (although it is still far from perfect).        DVD REVIEW    This new edition of CALIGULA is entirely superior to any previous video release of the film, in fact, I suspect it probably looks better here than it did in theatres.  Image has spared no expense in this stuning \\"imperial\\" edition, and it is so lavish and luxurious that it would have no doubt pleased the emperor Caligula himself.  The most important feature of this release is of course how the film looks and sounds.  I've owned every previous release of this film (including the Beta video tape and the LaserDisc) and I truly felt like I was watching the movie for the first time.  CALIGULA is never going to look too sharp and clear, simply because of the way Tinto Brass photographed it, but I think in this edition wenow have the film in it's ultimate form.  The colors are bright and vibrant and background details of the awesome sets by Danilo Donati can now be seen for the first time.  Lines of dialogue that I had never been able to make out before now come clearly from my speakers for the first time.  It is simply amazing what Image has done with the prints.  Speaking of which, we now have an entirely new cut of the film and it is a masterwork.  Gone is all of Bob Guccione's hardcore pornography (and lets face it, that is what it was) and instead we are able to see for the first time the beautiful footage that Brass shot for scenes like the Tiberius Grotto and the Bordello ship.  The film also unfolds differently with scenes restored to their intended running order as scripted by Gore Vidal.  The woods sequence no longer opens the film but appears (in an extended form with never before seen footage) in it's proper place in the middle of the film.  I will say that the editing on all of the new footage is a bit rough and it does not appear to have been \\"cleaned up\\" as much as the rest of the film stock but this is a minor complaint.  /  Still there is so much more to this edition of CALIGULA than just the two cuts of the film.  There are three theatrical trailers that are real treasures.  There are also three marvelous commentary tracks from Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and journalist Ernest Volkman.  These often humorous commentaries alone would be worth the price of the video but there is SO MUCH MORE.  There is a half hour interview with John \\"Longinus\\" Steiner.  A full half hour interview with Lori Wagner, the actress who played Agripina (or was it Messillina?) in the Guccione porn footage.  Most importantly there is an in depth interview with director Tinto Brass that is fascinating.  AND STILL THERE IS MORE MORE MORE!  How about an hours worth of deleted and extended scenes?  This footage has not been remastered and it is often in rough shape but it is still amazing to see it.  There is also around an hours worth of behind the scenes footage.  The DOCUMENTARY ON THE MAKING OF GORE VIDAL'S CALIGULA is imported here from the 20th Anniversary DVD release but this time there are TWO VERSIONS, one long and one short (can you believe it?).  There are also extensive still photo archives that will take you a long time to watch and trust me, these photos are worth looking at and they will show you a lot about how CALIGULA was made.  There are loads of photos of Tinto Brass directing as well as fotos of Gore \\"I'm taking my name off this\\" Vidal on the set.  As if all this was not enough, you can put the disc in your computer and read not one but two versions of the Gore Vidal screenplay as well as the complete novel based on the screenplay.  There are also photos of the Penthouse Pets who did the porno footage as well as an unintentionally funny interview with Bob Guccione.  Now we all owe a great debt to Bob, without whom there would have been no CALIGULA (at least not as we know it today) but I've gotta say that he comes off as a pretty crazy fellow in the magazine interviews and to here him blathering on interminably about \\"art\\" and \\"excellence\\" and trying to appear sophisticated had me doubled over with laughter.  Not surprisingly, no one in the commentaries or interviews has much nice to say about him (Tinto Brass gives him the easiest time I suppose) but if Bob had not decided to take an already risque film and insert some explicit porn into it, I doubt very much whether we would still be sitting around talking about CALIGULA today.  And now we have the best of both worlds because those who love CALIGULA for its porno aspects have disc one and those who love CALIGULA as a historical art film have disc two, and those who just want a cool fast paced sword and sandal kind of thing (or a version you can share with your grandmother) can buy the new R rated release that is sold seperately and also looks and sounds spectacular.  /  I forgot tomention that the imperial edition comes in a high quality slip case and fold out inner keepcase with beautiful artwork of the cast.  Each of the three discs feature a photo of a different cast member, McDowell, Mirren and O'Toole.  Now certainly this is the longest review I ever wrote for Amazon but it is also the most spectacular release I have ever seen of any DVD.  It truly sets a new standard for what a special edition should be.  Congratulations to all involved.

B000TEUSJA|5.0|This version is NOT the original R rated theatrical release that was previously released on VHS by Vestron video.  That version contained many alternate angles and scenes and was perhaps the finest edit of CALIGULA ever made.  This present edition is a remasterd version of the 1999 R rated version that uses no alternate angles and is edited from the \\"uncut\\" version only.  It is an inferior version from the original because it is poorly edited, however it follows the general form of the theatrical R cut.<br /><br />With all the much deserved hoopla over the IMPERIAL edition of CALIGULA, it is nice to see that Image has taken as much care with the often neglected R rated version as they did with the uncut version.  The film has never looked or sounded better.  I have always loved the \\"R\\" cut of the film (for one thing you don't have to be embarrased to watch it with your family or more sensitive friends) and I am very grateful that this cut has now been restored to  visual glory.  There are also three theatrical trailers included on the disc.  It comes in a beautiful package with an embossed slip cover.  I think the cover art for this version is actually more attractive than that chosen for the 3 disc edition.  If you are looking for a version of CALIGULA that everyone can appreciate, this is it.  Bravo to Image entertainment!

0975991477|3.0|Readers who are not scientifically disposed may feel disinclined to slog through the long and rather dry explanations of cellular biology that Dr. Lipton presents, but those who manage to do so will be rewarded with information that can open their mind to a new way of perceiving and experiencing our world. Above all else, Dr. Lipton's research points out that we are not slaves to genetic programming. He explains that the cell membrane, which behaves like a programmable computer chip, allows us to have a far greater say about how we experience our bodies and the world than we may have understood before.  What does this mean on a practical level? We can choose not to participate in so-called \\"genetic\\" diseases that may have shown up in our family history by consciously embracing thoughts and emotions that give the body a different message.     Dr. Lipton likens the body to a country that is populated by trillions of conscious cells that are governed by the mind. We each have the responsibility to ask ourselves what kind of government we are running. One that places the cell population in a state of constant fear, or one that assures the cell population that all is well? Fear causes the cells to stop reproducing and retreat into a protective mode while messages of peace and well-being promote their growth and healthy replacement. Dr. Lipton does not tell his readers to merely start thinking happy thoughts. He addresses the subject of the powerful subconscious as an emotionless data bank that processes 20,000,000 bits of environmental stimuli per second compared to the conscious mind which processes 40 bits of information per second.  As Dr. Lipton points out, it is the subconscious which must be reprogrammed if we are to see real change in our lives.  This means moving outside group consciousness, closing our minds to the media and thinking for ourselves. Is this easy? No. Is it worth it? Undoubtedly.      While Dr. Lipton does offer some practical advice on consciousparenting, we felt that he leaves the reader hanging in a disappointing epilogue entitled \\"Spirit and Science\\" and an addendum that serves as an advertisement for a Kinesiology based program called PSYCH-K. In the epilogue, Dr. Lipton argues that the earth will ultimately be transformed into a paradise of love. He predicts that this will take place through a non-Darwinian type of evolution that he calls the \\"survival of the most loving.\\"  This serves as a disappointing ending to readers who were looking forward to a \\"how to\\" chapter that would give them more practical applications for the material that was presented.

However, all is forgiven, as Blackbird blew the roof off my expectations. I've been listening to it back-to-back since I got it; I just can't get enough.   This may well be the best album released this year by anyone. Vocals are flawless and powerful, guitar riffs are better than ever. Tremonti, Kennedy and company have truly outdone themselves here, and I for one appreciate it. If you needed a good reason to crank up your stereo, look no further. Alter Bridge is back in town!

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Moving away from the Creed with a new singer sound.  This album has more harmony than the first.  It also has more lead riffs that complement the main riffs most likely because Myles was fully integrated into the songwriting process this time.  Overall, I just like the sound of this album better than the first.  The melodies are slightly improved on this album as well as the instruments have been taken up a notch from a technical standpoint.  Overall, definitely better than the first and better than any of Creed's albums.  If I could keep anything from Creed, it would be the lyrics.  Both bands lean toward trite and spiritual lyrics; however, I found the triteness more excusable with Stapp because he used more symbolism and left more to interpretation.  I gave this five stars because it is closer to a perfect album than a four star album, but I would not consider perfect, strictly from a lyrical standpoint.  Overall, everything on this album is top-notch and dare I say it, innovative in its use of two great musical minds that I hope will separate from the plethora of other alternative metal bands that give the genre a bad name.

1402528140|4.0|NOTE: This review is for the unabridged audio version.<br /><br />I hesitated to tackle this book since I've found some of Eco's previous books to be a bit difficult to understand (I'm not the most intellectually gifted reader!)<br /><br />But this one was extremely entertaining (except for a short period in which he gets into heavy theological discussion which verges on sermonizing). Most of the book is the interesting and often hilarious telling of the adventures of a young man named \\"Baudolino\\" who goes on a quest for the Holy Grail.<br /><br />Having the book read by the talented George Guidall (one of the best narrators in the business) was a big help and the entire book, although long (19 hrs!) went quickly. In some ways, I didn't want the adventures to end.<br /><br />I'm sure literary critics will discover and discuss all sorts of hidden meanings and symbolism that I missed. Who cares? I had fun reading it and consider it 19 hours very well spent!

B000LXHK2C|5.0|At first I had doubts about Russell Crowe taking a lead in a romantic comedy but but was I pleasantly surprised. This movie is an absolute sleeping beauty, a winner of a delightful passage in the gorgeous south of France.<br />Bravura performances by Albert Finny in the flashback scenes of our hero's boyhood. Marvellous story, sharp and witty script, fluid movement, a romp from one end to the other. Most wonderful of all was Crowe who mixed the hard nosed investment fast lane type with a man coming to grips with life's real values so well, I wanted the movie to keep on and on and show us more how he settled into his paradise in the Louberon.<br />All the supporting players were wonderful, but above all, I loved the cutbacks to Finney and the insights of how the boy became the man. This kind of wonderful character development is rare in most movies today. Kudos to the great<br /> Ridley Scott and writer Marc Klein for giving me a few hours to forget about the crappy world and remind me that there are places in today's world one can escape to and feel wonderfully human,even if it's<br />sitting watching a movie. Highly recommended! Vive Lamour!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I wonder how many people griping over the sound are either judging this by the poor-quality leaked version that was out on the internet or listening to   128 kbps-encoded MP3's on their iPods? I don't agree at all that the regular CD, played on a decent system, sounds at all muddy or poorly produced. I can hear all the instruments in every song with complete clarity. Yes, the production is dense, but when you have a band with as many people as are in the E-Street Band, that is going to happen. These are big, anthemic rock songs with a lot of instrumentation. It's completely invalid to compare the production on this record to Fogerty's latest. Of course that record sounds completely different; the production is much more stripped down. And while that suits \\"Revival\\" just fine, there is no way that style of production would suit most of the songs on \\"Magic\\".    Aside from that, I think this is the best thing Bruce has done in years, and I think it's a phenomenal album. If you prefer to live in the past and play \\"The River\\", well fine, but I always thought *that* was the most poorly recorded record in the Springsteen catalog...

B000002UAR|5.0|This is my favorite Beatles album.  If your going to get one Beatles album, get this or Rubber Soul, but Revolver is better.
B0009X7664|5.0|Some great things that happened in the book are left out, but this is still a great movie.  Peck is amazing as Atticus; just as I pictured him to be.  Scout and Jem are pretty good, too.  A classic!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|When Alter Bridge released their first CD in 2004, I cemented them as the best rock band on the planet. I loved their first CD \\"One day Remains\\" maybe more than other people. But this CD is also something very very special. All in all, it's a more sophisticated album from Alter Bridge.     While the CD contains some very weak songs (which is more than their previous which only had 2 bad songs : \\"One day remains\\" and \\"Burn it down\\") like \\"Break me down\\"; \\"White knuckles\\" -these two sound the same basically- and \\"Before tomorrow comes\\", this Album contains 3 standout songs that if they were the only songs on the CD it would be worthwhile splashing 15 or 20 bucks for it.     Those 3 songs that really stand out and carry this album are : \\"Wayward One\\" (superb rock song, just solid all the way and great solo) ;  \\"Watch Over You\\" (the ULTIMATE ballad, the slowest song on the album and by far the most superior melodically, just Unbelievable) and \\"Blackbird\\" (this song is, is, well it's like \\"Fade to Black\\" in the sense it defines this Album because the lyrics (which are the best on the CD) and the guitar woek and especially the haunting perfromance by Myles Kennedy's voice on this song are stupendous (Fade to black is still better, but this song is nonetheless great).    Some other notables include \\"Ties that Bind\\" , \\"Brand New Start\\" and \\"Coming Home\\".    This CD has much more solos than the previous one which is definitely a plus, but the writing has also greatly improved. But above everything else, this CD accomplishes something extraordinary: it shows us how much incredible talent Mark Tremonti has, what a superb range and variation Myles Kennedy possesses in his voice, it shows us that this band has no ceiling and above all else, it cements Alter Bridge as the best rock band- hands down- in the world.
1592402690|5.0|If you're the kind of Beatle fan that love discussing not only about their lives and accomplishments, but also getting down to the technical aspects involved in the creation of their revolutionary music, this is A MUST ONE to have.    Reading it is a very enjoyable experience, especially when it comes down to the explanation of the tricks they had to do in the then pre-historic technology (but still, great) Abbey Road studio to generate and record the very special sonic wishes of the Beatles.    The book itself made me realize (this time for sure) that Geoff Emerick is, really, the co-producer of Revolver and Pepper. And that means a lot!
0786290218|5.0|The book was in good shape.  The print was large enough to read comfortaby.  I liked the book.
0142001104|5.0|I had seen the DVD prior to reading the book so was visually aware of what was being written about.  I think the book brought out more details from both authors.  As I now reflect on what I received from reading this book I believe 'humility' stands out.  Rule #6 has life changing value.  Also that there exist possibilities of greatest actualization and service beyond perfection and self.  A must read book.

0143038419|5.0|To those who can find mostly fault in this book and little good, I have included in this post a small but absolutely beautifully written passage from Ms. Gilbert's work that totally made me want to read the rest of EPL.  It appears early on in the book, after her husband has finally signed the divorce papers after a protracted, hostile standoff, and she has arrived in Rome. To me it doesn't read like someone who is all about \\"ME\\" but rather someone who is aware enough to get to the heart of emotions that afflict all of us at one time or another.      \\"Depression and Loneliness track me down after ten days in Italy. I am walking through the Villa Borghese one evening after a happy day spent in school, and the sun is setting gold over St. Peter's Basilica. I am feeling contented in this romantic scene, even if I am all by myself, while everyone else in the park is either fondling a lover or playing with a laughing child. But I stop to lean against a balustrade and watch the sunset, and I get to thinking a little too much, and then my thinking turns to brooding, and that's when they catch up with me.     They come upon me all silent and menacing like Pinkerton Detectives, and the flank me--Depression on my left, Loneliness on my right. They don't need to show me their badges. I know these guys very well. We've been playing a cat-and-mouse game for years now. Though I admit that I am surprised to meet them in this elegant Italian garden at dusk. This is no place they belong.     I say to them, \\"How did you find me here? Who told you I had come to Rome?\\"     Depression, always the wise guy, says, \\"What--you're not happy to see us?\\"     \\"Go away,\\" I tell him.     Loneliness, the more sensitive cop, says, \\"I'm sorry, ma'am. But I might have to tail you the whole time you're traveling. It's my assignment.\\"     \\"Id really rather you didn't,\\" I tell him, and he shrugs almost apologetically, but only moves closer.     Then they frisk me. They empty my pockets of any joy I hadbeen carrying there. Depression even confiscates my identity; but he always does that. Then Loneliness starts interrogating me, which I dread because it always goes on for hours.  He's polite but relentless, and he always trips me up eventually. He asks if I have any reason to be happy that I know of. He asks why I am all by myself tonight, yet again. He asks (though we've been through this line of questioning hundreds of times already) why I can't keep a relationship going, why I ruined my marriage, why I messed things up with David, why I messed things up with every man I've ever been with. He asks me where I was the night I turned thirty, and why things have gone so sour since then. He asks why I can't get my act together, and why I'm not at home living in a nice house and raising nice children like any respectable woman my age should be. He asks why, exactly, I think I deserve a vacation in Rome when I've made such a rubble of my life. He asks me why I think that running away to Italy like a college kid will make me happy. He asks where I think I'll end up in my old age, if I keep living this way.     I walk back home, hoping to shake them, but they keep following me, these two goons. Depression has a firm hand on my shoulder and Loneliness harangues me with his interrogation. I don't even bother eating dinner; I don't want them watching me. I don't what to let them up the stairs to my apartment, either, but I know Depression, and he's got a billy club, so there's no stopping him from coming in if he decides that he wants to.     \\"It's not fair for you to come here,\\" I tell Depression. \\"I paid you off already. I served my time backing New York.\\"     But he just gives me that dark smile, settles into my favorite chair, puts his feet on my table and lights a cigar, filling the place with his awful smoke. Loneliness watches a sighs, then climbs into my bed and pulls the covers over himself, fully dressed, shoes and all. He's going to make me sleep with him again tonight, I just know it.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|An amazing album. The opening track \\"Fingernail Moon\\" blew me away the first time I heard it and every time since. The arrangements on this album are astounding with layers of Annie's voice weaving textures around the lyrics. BTW, the lyrics was a weak point in her first solo efforts (\\"Diva\\" comes to mind) but here they shine with phrases that stick to your mind -- like the title of the track \\"Ghosts In My Machine\\" or the throwaway line \\"this is the sound of of a baby's first breath\\" in \\"Lost\\" or even \\"I wish I had a lover that could turn this water into wine\\" from \\"Womankind\\". This together with musical hooks makes it very seductive.
B0006L0LOS|4.0|Superheroes have always been the object of a systematic cult in the USA. So sooner or later a woman had to come into the picture and since Supergirl never satisfied anyone, they had to look for someone else, someone a little bit more attractive. And since Spiderman had many long legs and arms blocking the way they had to look somewhere else farther out of the way. They looked in Egypt, they looked in China, they looked in the Middle Ages for an animal connected to women and who was both satanic and in relation with freedom, liberty and freewheeling. That's how the cat came out of the wizard's hat or bonnet. Catwoman was thus saved from the water of the river, which is absolutely accurate, and brought back to life in the human world of the night. She became the queen of the roofs. Then add a dishonest but successful industrialist exploiting women with beauty products that you must definitely not stop if you don't want to develop some strange Karposi syndrome or cancer. Then add his wife, an old belle who has aged faster than necessary and who wants to get rid of her husband and put her hands on the golden goose and the bank reserves before he finally realizes he does not need her anymore. And then you have the perfect thriller. A little bit of romance between the cop who is supposed to arrest Catwoman and the woman she is supposed to be and you have a heartbreaking story. But the poor Catwoman cannot stay because she is nothing but a living dead. So sadness takes over and she can only exist at night and on the roofs of the city. And there you have some kind of a myth of the cat seen as a symbol of ... what have I said already? But what's the meaning of this fable? Nothing is crystal clear in this tale, or if it is clear it is just as clear as black pudding juice at the bottom of a completely opaque wooden bottle. Only a cat can see anything in there. God bless the child.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesersity Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Not as awestruck as the other (very helpful) reviewers. In fact, this double-disc DVD is best described as smooth, as in glassy ocean waters. Should leave you with a great feeling; give it a listen. Not usually a voyeur of the bonus stuff, but this one is very down home and easy to watch. Superb is a good word for the entire package. Just like the full length On An Island set from the RAH concerts, the bonus footage of the tour is very very smooth. Nuff said. Grab one to go, you won't regret it.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I found the CD to be an excellent choice. I am a senior citizen and much prefer the classical music with magnificent voices to most of the stuff today geared to the youger generations. Although - I grew up with Elvis and still love to dance to the rock and roll of the 50's and 60's.

When we listen to it, we turn into soul singers, gospel choirs and blues festival lovers who love dancing in the park in bare feet.  I am not kidding, we almost feel like we can see them all playing at the park with us.  Unbelievable CD, it really is.

0143038419|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book start to finish and plan to pass it on to my daughter and nieces.  It was very disheartening to read the \\"slams\\" this author got from other women.  I admire Ms. Gilbert; you don't get to where she is by being a slacker. That woman is well-educated and very disciplined. Writing a book is damn hard work and if any of the naysayers ever attempted one like this they would be eating their words.  It also takes sheer guts to step out of the box like she did and brave foreign countries (alone, no less).    Don't knock it until you've tried it! (and succeeded)!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Springsteen continues an amazing run with his latest release, Magic.  The disc is full of tightly woven terrific rock and roll that will appeal to fans of the Boss of all ages.  A couple of these songs are destined to be must do performances in his future shows, like \\"Radio Nowhere\\" and \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes.\\"  The E Street Band continues to be outstanding and it is a joy to have them back after so many years.  When they are all working together, it is a work of art.  Solid writing and terrific sound- Bruce delivers another strong performance here.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|This type story has been visited many times, but this is a nice variation on the theme. I didn't feel I was watching a remake of anything. Cage plays a magician with a Vegas act that gets noticed by a government agent played by Moore. She wants him to find a bomb terrorists have planted. Now it sounds predictable and it is to some degree. However; I was never bored or felt the story was out of line. Overall a reasonably entertaining SciFi movie. I recommend renting before buying. I think it is replayable.
B000VDDWE2|4.0|Spectacular BD and movie! Excellent acting, special effects and story make this one of my all time favorite films. The PQ is beautiful with sharp detail and good solid, natural looking color. Nice solid blacks and the movie is grain free all the way thru. SQ is no slacker! Major Dynamics and fine details to behold in this DTS HD Uncompressed 5.1 extravaganza! Amazing! BD technology is still kicking my butt! I'm still waiting till the day that this format ceases to amaze me. Could be a good long while with releases such as this one coming out. Have a great time with this one! Highly Recommended!
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|This is a terrific release by one of the most dynamic and interesting artists working today. No longer the brash and shocking young lady of the early 80's new wave movement, Annie is now a mature, thoughtful, somewhat world weary woman singing with a new depth of feeling and experience. She is no less provocative than in her Eurythmics days, indeed some of her new songs smack you right between the eyes with a force and power she could have never achieved twenty years ago.<br /><br />The title of the album gives fair warning; there are songs of loss, sadness and pain, as well as hope, joy and indomitable spirit. But her observations on the world around us; on subjects like war, love, poverty, aids, truth, lies, and ever changing relationships are at once touching, powerful, and ultimately beautiful.<br /><br />The opening song, DARK ROAD is, in her own words, a metaphor for the journey of life. We can only see dimly what lies ahead of us as we travel this road. If we pay attention along the way, we are likely to see many terrible and wonderful things.<br /><br />Annie is a stunningly gorgeous and talented woman whose remarkable gifts have afforded her the privilege of going places and seeing things many of us will never experience. It is a testament to her intelligence and spirit that she hasn't taken the easy path so many others may have when writing these songs. She hasn't barraged us with poppy, vacuous tunes tailor made for top 40 radio ubiquity, nor has she tried to convince us that life is an endless party for the elite; a party most of us will never be invited to attend. Instead, she has chosen to create lasting and meaningful art that touches us at our deepest levels and, heaven forbid, actually makes us think and feel.<br /><br />An excellent album - in my opinion the best of her career.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|I personally feel that Annie Lennox is one of the finest singers of her generation and has impeccable craftsmanship and taste. I also feel her records are reliable for their passionate delivery, but cool and level-headed direction. It doesn't seem to me like she strays too far from doing what she knows best, it always seems to be a winning formula. I know that whatever new music she releases will be 'tasteful' and worthwhile to hear.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|First off, Im not going to knock the price. HD is going to be more so get use to it. HOWEVER, I am going to knock the editing. I for one want the orginal series in HD, BUT UNEDITED. I dont want the new CGI edits. I want the orginal. Until I get that, Parmount will get no more money from me.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is one of the best series concerning ghosts, demons, monsters and others that I`ve ever seen yet. They almost make it seem realistic for the point of view that they do use real facts such as the salt ect... This series is also grate for making RPG`s or for a role player with a wanting for something ``Supernatural``. The story line is easy to fallow, all in all its a FANTASTIC show!

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This version is an insult to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  I absolutely loved the novel and this movie did not come close to capturing the romance, charm and character of it.  It was as if the director hadn't even read or understood the novel.  There was no depth to Darcy's character.  The most vital points about his honorable character and integrity were left out. Elizabeth's discovery of this was poignant to her falling in love with him.  The scenes of their meetings were rushed (probably due to time constraints) one after another when in the book, months go by before they see each other again.  The portrayal of the Bennet family is exaggerated.  While Austen captures the heart of a woman with the slow and deliberate even agonizing wooing between Darcy and Elizabeth, this movie misses the mark.

B000JU7NCE|5.0|I just wish I were in one of those concerts because they really played their music, I mean, not only their hits and singles but also the great b-side songs. There is just one little detail I would complain about, and is the fact that I missed the keyboards. Other than that this DVD is a compilation you need to have and as they say: \\"Enjoy it in the dark\\"
B0000214F0|1.0|I expected so much more going into this movie, but I got absolutely nothing. I did manage to waste my time though. The orgies that bounce from scene to scene distract you from the entire purpose of the movie. Why was this even called \\"Caligula\\"? If this dude wanted to make a porn flick then that's what he should've done, and left the historical aspect out of it. I didn't feel educated or enlightened by anything that I saw because this movie has nothing to do with ancient Roman history or anything else that would take more than 2 brain cells to appreciate. It's like watching over 2 hours of sex, sex, sex, and more sex. Don't get me wrong, I love sex, but that's all they showed, and I think to make sex the entire basis of this movie was tired and tacky. I watch porn, and I don't have a problem with sex scenes by any means, but these weren't simulated sex scenes at all. I'm afraid this was indeed the real thing. This movie has every nasty, disgusting and depraved act known to man. This movie portrayed the Romans as nothing more than sick animals who did nothing more but have sex all day. Frankly, I got nothing out of it, and I can't imagine that anybody would get anything out of it besides getting their rocks off. This movie was no holds barred incest, rape, homesexuality, Lesbianism, torture, non-stop orgies, fellatio and degrading human beings. I'm so disappointed in Malcolm McDowell, Sir John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, and Dame Helen Mirren because their talents were wasted on something that was nothing more than meaningless smut. With actors like this I expected a MASTERPIECE! Honestly, I can't think of one good thing to say about this movie except...PLEASE GET YOUR KIDS OUT OF THE HOUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!
B00079FUI6|5.0|This product was great.  I really like the show and look forward to getting Season 2.
0805079831|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read.  I've been an activist since the early 80's, have read Chomsky and Galeano and both of Amy Goodman's books - I've learned from all of them but I've learned more from Naomi Klein in just the first few chapters of this book than anything else I've ever read.  I finally really understand the \\"economic shocks\\" that have been imposed in so many countries and destroyed entire societies for the sole purpose of major corporate takeover.  Klein explains economics like no one else and I believe that if enough people in the U.S. would read this book, we'd have more than a \\"regime change\\".  Please - buy as many copies of this book as you can and pass it on to friends, libraries, schools.  Thank you, Naomi.
0440238609|1.0|Parents, before you offer these \\"fantasy\\" reads for your kids be aware that this author is promoting atheism and these books are anti-christian, anti-church and anti-God.  Be Careful, and be sure that this is what you intend to teach and encourage in your children. I have to give all of these books a thumbs down based on my personal values and beliefs.

B00012FXB8|3.0|Its a must have if you want to complete your alien collection, but this movie is a mess. There are many places in the move where you can't even here the sound, or the people talking. There is even a warning before the movie is played warning you that you will not be able to hear parts of the movie. This is a really long movie, and there are a few funny parts that were left out of the TV version, but I would not waste your money on this movie unless you are getting it to complete your collection with all 4 movies.    Not a movie I would sit around and watch too often but it's nice to watch once a year. It's really quite boring. I find myself turning it off in the middle as its very long and I get tired of sitting there.
B000UJ24SC|5.0|This cd might be the best of 07 argueably. I love this band and everything they represent. each cd is a perfect 10. They are the only band that I will listen to constently and never get bored of. saying that this cd is close to Miasma in the brutality section and death metal riffs. The step they did take away from miasma is the darker sound and its more melodic which i love. Not sure which cd i like better between miasma and nocturnal(they are better than unhallowed which is also a 10 so that must make them like a 12 or 13) BDM is on another level. favorite track deathmask devine
B000001EL3|5.0|I do not normally give five stars, and I do not normally like American band. But ....this album is a KNOCK OUT. Period.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Fit in the camera perfect because these are Canon.  (Canon 10D)  These batteries last me about 2 to 3 years before they start to have a shorter life span.  I have one set that is five years old that lasts about 70 shots.  New ones last forever.  I alwasy carry two sets on photo shoots.  All temperatures.  Thought about going generic and saving the $, but read too many reviews where the replacement didn't quite fit.  You get what you pay for.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Great movie! Lots of unexpected twists and turns! Will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat! Excellent plot!
B0002V7O3S|5.0|All I can say is this is one of the best abduction movies I've ever seen. It's truly outstanding. I have seen many alien abduction movies, but this one is the best, it jumps right into the movie from the start. The characters in the movie are excellent! Everything is layed out well.    If you are into Sci-Fi movies, your collection is incomplete without this item.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I would be a liar if I didn't admit that I was a bit wary of Nightwish's new frontwoman Anette Olzon, much less upset with the band for the acrimonious dismissal of their former lead singer Tarja Turunen. After all she is the replacement for the band's much beloved Tarja. Whatever suspicions were put to rest when I hear samples of the band's new material with Anette a few months ago on the internet.<br /><br />I finally received my copy of the band's long awaited DARK PASSION PLAY. Whatever concerns I had for the band's new music went immediately out the window. Anette's vocals are nothing like Tarja's. I don't think anyone in the realm of metal can match Tarja's powerful vocals. I also think that the band knew that they could not find another Tarja. People should realize that and get over the fact that Tarja is gone. Anette's vocals has that same polished quality I hear in the lead singers from Echoes of Eternity, Within Temptation, and a smidgeon of Leave's Eyes. Maybe too much but at least she can sing unlike most women that pollutes pop music nowadays. Her vocals meshes well with the band. The music is as aggressive as ever without losing forsaking the beautiful melodies that made me fall in love with Nightwish.<br /><br />I personally think the production and mastering of DARK PASSION PLAY is great. Compared to the band's earlier albums, this is about as perfect as perfect gets. I think Tuomas has written some of his best material to date. Bassist Marco Hietala contributes his gruff vocals again on a couple of tracks like \\"Master Passion Greed\\" (one of the cd's more aggressive tracks) and \\"The Islander\\". I am particularly fond of \\"The Islander\\" which is more folk than metal and an absolutely stunning track. Marco shares with Anette on the track. Another favorite track off the album is the celtic-tinged instrumental \\"Last of the Wilds\\". I definitely wasn't expecting Nightwish to delve into celtic music. I thought it was great.<br /><br />The only song on this cds that left me unimpressed is \\"Master Passion Greed\\" and \\"Seven Days to the Wolves\\". The songs really didn't have a memorable hook to keep my attention focused. They are bad songs but just not anything to write home about. Overall I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed DARK PASSION PLAY and Anette. After seeing the band perform in concert, whatever fears I had about the band and Anette was all put to rest. Yes, they do sound different with a new singer but Tuomas's uncanny knack for composing beautiful melodies is still there. He just has a new muse to write his music for. Some people may be disappointed in what they hear but I wasn't, that's just my personal opinion. If you don't like it, that's not my problem.essed is \\"Master Passion Greed\\" and \\"Seven Days to the Wolves\\". The songs really didn't have a memorable hook to keep my attention focused. They are bad songs but just not anything to write home about. Overall I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed DARK PASSION PLAY and Anette.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love this show.  Every episode is interesting and the character developement is great.  I can't wait for season 2!
B00006469V|4.0|I adore this performance and rank it second(tied with Kubelik) to only KNA54\62. Gottlieb Frick is the most enjoyable and compelling Gurnemanz since Griendl and Hotter-the Griendl specifically is very much in the same vein,as is the Kurt Moll with Kubelik(not Levine). Frick's voice is dark and smooth and might startle some at first, especially those accustomed to Barenboim, or Thieleman. One of my friends even said Frick and hotter sounded too much like gods(idiotic).<br /> I have never been a fan of Dieskau's Amfortas, especially in the 56KNA and here he does a better job, sort of, though I found some of the same problems. For instance, his ennunciations are at times very bothersome(such as the Morganspracht where he actually changes words.) I much prefer the glorious London for KNA62 or Hotter for KNA54 or Weikl for Stein.<br />Christa Ludwig is marvelous as Kundry, maybe the finest I know.<br />My only problem is Rene Kollo. I dont know why Solti liked him so much because his voice is about as commonplace as I can think of. He is good one level but cannot vary at all. Just listen to act III when a good Parsifal destroys you with his \\"IT IS I\\", here Kollo cant handle it and hastily rushes through about as uninspriringly as I have heard.<br />Beside that-the conducting is wonderful and I dont agree with those who say it isnt  mystical enough-that is pety and such an obvious attack from the amateur who is just restating what he has heard from others. This is an obvious attack because of the sensational amount of intensity and passion he brings to the more sensational violent aspects of Wagners scores. However, hear he is perfect and just as valid as KNA is, just completely different.<br />After KNA62\54, I recommend this performance equally with Kubeliks, though I wouldnt want to be without Barenboims(Jerusalem turns in the finest Parsifal I have heard) or Karajans or KNA51 or 52.
B0000844I8|5.0|What?? There isn't enough stars to rate this movie. They only gave me 5.<br /><br />This is the best version of Stargate I've ever seen. This is the movie that started the 10 year epic, and still continues even today in Atlantis. This move has all the original lines, which were cut out of the version that was shown on TV. There are a lot of extra scenes that I've never seen before, as well as some harsh language.<br /><br />Now that I have purchased the entire 10 year collection, as well as all the Atlantis seasons, this is a must have. I can't believe its been 10 years. This is by far the best move ever created, and the fact that it's still being played on TV with new Atlantis episodes 10 years later proves it.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Loreena McKennitt is one of a handful of artists from my youth I still listen to on a regular basis. I find her music so comforting to listen to after a long day at work. After a decade long hiatus, Loreena recently returned to the music scene late last year with AN ANCIENT MUSE and a US tour. NIGHTS FROM THE ALHAMBRA is Loreena's latest release which contains a bonus dvd of her PBS performance. The live cd is two cds of old and new material. I remember seeing her PBS performance and soaking in every song she sang. It is obvious that she was having a lot of fun during her show especially on songs like \\"The Mummer's Dance\\" and \\"Santiago\\". Judging by her little dancing with her accordion, it is obvious that Loreena was happy to be back on stage in front of a live audience. I loved listening to Loreena tell the audience stories behind the songs. I rarely buy live albums but NIGHTS FROM THE ALHAMBRA is definitely worth owning. There is not one song on both cds and dvd I did not like. Loreena could sing the phone book and still make it sound enchanting. NIGHTS FROM THE ALHAMBRA w/dvd is a definite must have for Loreena fans who have either seen or missed out on her US tour. Loreena was smart to package the live concert with both cds and the dvd. This is truly worth shelling out money for.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I was impressed with this film, and in the respectful assay into the life of the great Beatrix Potter. Director Chris Noonan has created a complete world here, with sweetness and heart, and a bit of fantasy, to set a scene for the wonderful Renee Zellweger to take over. Indeed, she is magnificent. The participation of Ewan McGregor and Emily Watson is a special treat, and the old dotty nanny, portrayed by Matyelok Gibbs is priceless! Also, let's all hope our mothers aren't like that as portrayed by Barbara Flynn; a very fine display of upper crust indifference.  Ms. Potter was an exceptional person, a feminist without knowing it; a champion of environmental and conservationist efforts. The DVD provides insights into this woman's remarkable life and her endless imagination. I'm surprised that no one had the sense to make a film about her before. Hollywood is re-making good films badly, and there's so much out there that needs attention. Thanks, Mr. Noonan, for bringing this wonderful woman's life to film...and Ms. Zellweger was the perfect choice!

B00063EMJ6|5.0|This CD is full of Neil Young's oldies you remember and oldies you forgot.  Great listening throughout.  Be prepared for some full-length versions of some of the biggest hits.
B000Q7ZNEK|5.0|I have been waiting for this release for over a year now.  I currently own the Music for the Masses, Violator, and Songs of Faith 5.1/Remasters.    Ultra is by far my favorite Depeche Mode work, while others are close there is something about the way the music on ultra as well as the vocals blend together. This is a smooth album.    The CD like all the remastered albums are not the highlight. I cannot audibly tell the difference between my original 1997 CD and the remastered, aside from some songs sounding a bit more bright or clear, the bass is a bit more punchy in some songs as well. That may be placebo effect.    On to the 5.1 mix. DTS and Dolby Digital  I have a mid to high end audio system that is properly calibrated, and the bass management is setup properly.  This is the first Depeche Mode album with a 5.1 mix that actually makes the songs sound different and not just up-mixed to surround sound.    In fact some of the songs sound very different. The sound engineers did not just take the original stereo recording and spread it out there was some obvious thought behind making Ultra a 5.1 album. Like it was made from the ground up again.    There are different sounds in different places, sounds you could not hear in the 2 channel recording and things that also don't even sound the same anymore.  The clarity is superb, the use of the surround channels is just right, sometimes they get distracting though.  What I really like is that they did not just stick the vocal tracks on the center channel like in some of the previous remasters.  The vocals are very well spread through the front speakers and carefully carry to the rears in some tracks.     The Dolby Digital and DTS mix are nearly identical. The difference in my opinion is fidelity. Some bass and clarity deviations between the two. But very hard to detect.    If you like or liked Ultra and have a 5.1 system, this is a must buy.  This is one of the things I fear that will be disappearing from the market with the dawn of digital downloads. High quality audio is rarely emphasized, and this mix is a complete reversal of that.
B000002UVX|5.0|Father Jimmy lays down a Stratocaster sermon and low!  the people were humbled.    From the opening remarks: This is for all the soldiers fighting in Chicago.  . .  oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam . . . this is called Machine Gun.    As if Vietnam was an after thought, to the struggle for the nation's political life in Chicago  This is what makes Hendrix a giant. He had giant ideas and they flowed through his hands to  create an aural/visual landscape.    At times the music will inform you, show you desolate plains of death shrouded in fog, cut through by  flashes of deadly tracer fire, it will pick you up and throw you.    You sit in the parking lot with the music ripping your mind and keep playing   as the clock tics you late. It doesn't matter.

B000RG1FMO|5.0|I loved Kanye's first album but his second seemed like a real let down, to be honest, I barely listened to it.  This album puts me right back to the way I felt the first time I listened to The College Dropout.  It is an excellent album and I recommend it to anyone who was thinking about buying it.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I was a loyal Creed fan from the beginning, so I continued to follow the careers of Scott Stapp and the other 3 members who went on to form Alter Bridge.  Alter Bridge's debut album \\"One Day Remains\\" was a very solid album, even better than Scott Stapp's solo album.  Mark Tremonti had definitely made better use of his amazing guitar skills, and Myles Kennedy had a vocal range I haven't heard in years.  Still, the album basically sounded like Creed with a new singer.  3 years later, the band has found themselves a new record label and new management, and have made the album they wanted to make.<br /><br />\\"Blackbird\\" features 13 songs (15 if you get it at Best Buy) for a low price of $7.99!  The band has made an album that truely brings back the spirit of rock n' roll, instead of adding to the pool of mainstream rock bands who make radio anthems.  The first track \\"Ties That Bind\\" kicks things into gear with a fast and heavy verse and an epic chorus.  \\"Come To Life\\" features a Korn-like guitar sound, which is certainly a new sound from these guys.  This is definitely a darker, heavier band than we've seen before.  Although it does feature a few radio-friendly tunes like the first single \\"Rise Today\\", overall this is more of a hard rock or metal album as opposed to a mainstream rock album.  Mark Tremonti is the best guitarist to emerge in the last 10 years, and on this album he makes it obvious.  Rather than playing the very polished, melodic and epic sounding riffs, his style is much grittier on this album, very Zakk Wylde esque.  Brian Marshall (bass) and Scott Phillips (drums) keep it interesting as well, but obviously it's Mark's guitar work and Myles' singing that will leave you stunned.  I admit that Alter Bridge's first album sounded extremely like Creed, but they've completely dropped any similarities this time around.  Rock & Roll is back, even if mainstream music doesn't give these guys the attention they deserve.
B00008NRL8|5.0|One of the few cds I can let play continuously,not a drag song on the list.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby defies categorization, in my view. He cuts across all kinds of music types, and has opened my eyes to other sounds. He is very talented. I think this is his best album.
B000BLI4PG|5.0|I first saw \\"The Warriors\\" way back in the 70s and have loved this movie and soundtrack ever since!  The songs included are from various artists, including the track \\"In The City\\" by Eagles and James Gang guitarist Joe Walsh.  However, I especially like the instrumental tracks arranged by DeVorzon, specifically for this soundtrack.  Some of you may recognize DeVorzon as the composer for the theme to the TV series S.W.A.T.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This soundtrack is beautiful, and exemplary. I was captivated by it in the movie, and I feel so very close to the lyrics by themselves. I give this album 5 stars for pure beauty.
B00005JLEJ|3.0|I'm no film buff: indeed, I seem to be going through a bout of revisiting icons of my college years.  Kurasawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\" left lasting memories and I wanted to see more of this great director's work.  The booklet giving background to Kagemusha was very helpful to me and I found the plot twist to be one that provoked further reflection in the days after I had watched the film.  It is one that I will keep and will watch again from time to time.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that the film has a number of relatively static set pieces, mostly associated with clan council meetings or the reception of emissaries.  There is a fascinating scene where an early \\"sniper\\" demonstrates an ingenious technique for setting up the fatal shot on which the plot turns.  At times the effect is a bit \\"archaic\\" and a bit reminiscent of one of the early Russian historic \\"epic\\" films about a Prince who defeats the Teutonic knights.  Still, the film held my interest all by itself, without reference to the history of the cinema.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I bought this box set for my husband as a birthday present after reading all the reviews for the USA and the UK box set.  Ae we have a multi region  dvd player, i decided to go with the USA version, because of the reviews that it was much better than the UK one, and also the price difference.    The box set took 3 weeks to arrive, which was not a problem as I ordered it in plenty of time for my husbands birthday.  Even with the £22 import duties the set came in at under £100, which was a bargain.    I openned the box and carefully checked every disk to make sure they they were not scratched.  I must say that the disks were very dirty, and some were scratched, but seemed to play ok.    The box itself is very lovely, with a plush plum velvetlining and the hidden compartment and with the added disk and book at made a great present.    I am so glad that I bough the USA box set,
B00001QEBQ|5.0|I believe this is the only Disney film where the main heroine isn't beguiled by love of a man to feel complete.  Not only that, but she doesn't scream feminist antics all over the place (like the annoying Jasmine in Aladdin).  Mulan shows that duty, honor and love of family and country, are very important.  I love showing this film over and over to my daughter because of this.  The fact that Mulan grows from an insecure clumsy and demure girl, to the hero of China, is a great story in its unfolding.  I love the artistry of the film and how all the backgrounds and nature look like Asian watercolor artwork.  The music is great, especially \\"Reflection\\" (the radio version of this song put Christina Aguilera's name on the map), and is beautifully sung by Broadway star Leah Salonga.  Donny Osmond also has a great song and many of the characters are voiced by popular Asian actors.  This is a very fine film and very underrated in the Disney array of animated features.  I would like to see more non-European Disney heroines in animated films.  Perhaps an African heroine, or a Japanese heroine.  That's another reason I like this film so much.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the type of show that appeals to everyone, no matter what their interests.  It has enough elements of a western to satisfy lovers of that genre, enough of scifi (it is space,after all) for it to be considered scifi.  It is a romance, a drama, an adventure, and thanks to Joss Whedon's terrific writing and the great timing of the actors, it is most definitely a comedy also.  I have, quite literally, not met anyone who has seen the show and not liked it.  I'm not just talking about people I know directly, who might then be supposed to have similar interests or tastes to mine.  No, any time I've been in a group of people (be it party, chat, forum or business meeting), if Firefly comes up there are two groups in the room:  those who love it, and those who haven't seen it (yet).  The Fox exec responsible for cancelling this show should be drummed out of town for being unable to pick a winning show.  Thank you to Universal for making the first movie -- [[ASIN:B000Q9IZ5C Serenity (Collector's Edition)]].  We're still waiting for our other two.

B000KJU182|4.0|The immensely talented Peter Ustinov displays his versatility not only producing, directing and acting in the notable film \\"Billy Budd\\" but also wrote the screenplay based on the Herman Melville short story.<br /><br />The setting is primarily aboard the H.M.S. Avenger in 1797 during one of the many wars between England and France.  Young Billy Budd played by a youthful Terence Stamp is impressed into the British Navy from an English merchant ship.  The pleasant easy going Budd immediately gains favor with the crew and the Avenger's captain the moral and dutiful Captain Vere played by Ustinov.  Despite his positive nature Budd runs afoul of cruel and sadistic Master of Arms, the blackhearted John Claggart, played superbly by star of the film Robert Ryan.  Veteran actor Melvyn Douglas playing voice of reason sailmaker Dansker represents the conscience of the crew as they respond to the power play aboard the ship.<br /><br />The film expertly emphasizes the clash between good and evil as Ryan and Stamp interract with Billy Budd innocently trying to win over Claggart.  The climax is reached as Ryan accuses Stamp of mutiny before the captain.  Stamp unable to defend himself due to a stammering problem lashes out and kills Ryan with a blow to the head.<br /><br />Ustinov now must uneviably decide the fate of the popular but unfortunate Budd as he is shackled by the military law he has sworn to abide by.

B00005T30L|4.0|Este tipo de pel&iacute;culas no es f&aacute;cil de criticar. Si bien es cierto que representa ese tipo de producciones sencillas, intimistas, nada vanidosas y orientadas al peque&ntilde;o sector del p&uacute;blico que no le incomoda mover una que otra neurona cuando se sienta frente a la pantalla (del tama&ntilde;o que sea), tambi&eacute;n es cierto que mucho de ese mismo p&uacute;blico podr&iacute;a pensar que es una pieza que no aporta mucho al g&eacute;nero.<br /><br />Pero la cinta llega a disfrutarse realmente, los personajes est&aacute;n bien trabajados, terminando por ser una pel&iacute;cula de esas que le hacen sentir a uno que hay gente que hace cine por amor al arte, aunque no genere decenas de millones de d&oacute;lares la primera semana de proyecci&oacute;n.
B00005JNQA|4.0|Nicole Kidman might have never looked so beautiful as she did playing the haunted UN interpreter Silvia Broome.  And Sean Penn has this masculine arrogance that somehow holds her attention long enough for her to forget about her pressing problems concerning Africa.  I saw this film again last night on cable TV and it was much more confusing the second time around.  Probably should invest in the DVD so I could access the deleted scenes which (maybe) explain everything.  There must be deleted scenes like crazy involving Catherine Keener talking to her agent and listening to the agent explain why she really needed to be in this movie, for they might as well have hired Nicole Richie so little acting ability was needed for her brief scenes with Penn.  Keener's mumbling, thin lipped accent made Nicole Kidman sound almost human.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack must have felt bells clicking in his head when he glimpsed Nicole Kidman and heard a tape of the various accents she has essayed on screen.  Not since Meryl Streep has anyone done so many so promiscously, and it is said that Pollack forcefed Kidman hours worth of tapes of Meryl Streep doing the famous \\"I had a farm in Africa\\" opening to OUT OF AFRICA, of which I now consider THE INTERPRETER an unoffical remake.  The implication is that Kidman, and her doomed family the Broomes, are the real inheritors of Africa, and that the black revolutions and counterrevolutions that have destroyed the Broomes are hopelessly evil and subhuman.  Why, Nicole, why?  Maybe you wanted to show you weren't afraid of big issues, but why play an African saint when so many talented black actresses were out there just longing for a big meaty part opposite Sean Penn--and many of them much more able to adopt a whispery Danish slash Dutch accent than you (not to mention playing the flute).  Do the DVD scenes tell us why the screenwriters decided to have her play the flute anyhow?  Was it just to get her back into the building after hours?<br /><br />Couldn't she have just forgotten her Metro Card or her purse or something?  No, no, it had to be musical--tragically musical.  John Garfield spent four months at Juilliard learning to play the piano for HUMORESQUE (1946), but Nicole Kidman learned the flute in under forty-five minutes on the set of MOULIN ROUGE.  Ah, the pace of modern filmmaking!  No wonder she seems to make even more movies than the stars of the Golden Age Hollywood cinema.t she have just forgotten her Metro Card or her purse or something?

Reading Level - Average  Easy to read, never a confusing paragraph.    Rate of Development - Extremely Fast  Picks up where \\"A Clash of Kings\\" left off.    The Story - More major battles, more death and mayhem, more intrigue and conspiracies.  Some mysteries revealed.    My Suggestion - Highly Recommended  This is by far my favorite book of the series.  This one will definately shock you and fill you with joy all at once.  The ending is very climatic.  I can only describe the series so far as a neverending joy to read.  1000 pages?  I wished it was 2000 pages.  It's just that good.
B000H305U0|2.0|I was a bit apprehensive when it came to listening to this CD. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of JT, but I thoroughly enjoyed his previous solo debut CD [[ASIN:B00006JO4Q Justified]], which was a very soulful affair. My apprehension came upon hearing the first single from this CD [[ASIN:B000H0MH4U SexyBack]], and that the majority of the CD would be produced by Timbaland. Not with standing one or two efforts (namely [[ASIN:B00008H2MM Cry Me a River]] which is a great song) I find Timbaland production soul less & cold. Alas that is how I would describe the majority of the songs on offer here. The only redeeming factors for this CD are the cuts:(Another Song) All Over Again , and Losing my Way, which benefits from a string section, & Hezekiah Walker & the Love Fellowship Choir. Very soulful. If only the rest of the CD could have followed suite.

0553588486|5.0|Minimum Maturity Level - Adult<br />Strong Language.  Extreme violence and gore.  Sexual situations.<br />Not for kids.<br /><br />Previous Reading Required - None<br />This is the start of an epic series of 7 books.<br /><br />Reading Level - Average<br />Very easy to keep up with.  Not surprising since GRRM used to screenwrite.  The book basically reads like a movie.<br /><br />Rate of Development - Average<br />It takes a while to get a good character backgrounds.  And there are A LOT of characters.  But once you get halfway through, you come to know the characters very intimately.  The story develops into intrigue and mystery fairly quick.  By halfway through the book, it becomes a \\"page-turner\\".<br /><br />The Story - The King's Hand (the king's right hand man) has died.  Some think he was murdered.  King Robert Baratheon then appoints Eddard Stark, a lifelong friend to succeed the position.  Reluctantly, Eddard accepts.  Anything after all this, is a spoiler so you MUST read the book.<br /><br />My Suggestion - Extremely Highly Recommended<br />Like I said in the story section, anything I try to tell you after Eddard agrees to be the Hand IS a spoiler.  GRRM has a way of getting you to like, love, and hate all his characters in the book.  All the characters have their own personality and seem like real genuine people.  Every chapter is a person's perspective and not a number.  So when you read the chapter entitled \\"BRAN\\", you are reading what is going on through HIS eyes and his eyes only.  It's a very immersive way of writing and I come to like it a lot.  I said before that development is a bit slow for characters but the mystery and intrigue happens rather quickly.  Some mysteries actually carry on into the next few books.  Some of you with quick minds may uncover some mysteries before the characters actually do and that is part of the fun.  If you want a good epic fantasy that is down to earth with war, intrigue, and suspense, then this is your book.  Just be ready to buy all the other books that follow, because they get even better.y get even better.
6305428050|1.0|This is a 5 star movie - hilarious - but I gave it 1 star so people who sort by lowest rating will see this.  The person who titled their review Adventurers in Racism is a moron.  Obviously this person suffers from deep seeded issues that he should see a counselor for and he must not have watched the movie.  To correct a few things.....<br /><br />1) the bad guys in the movie were both white and black - in fact the main guy who wanted to \\"dispose\\" of the kids for fear of them telling the cops about the stolen cars was a white man - not black.  And black car thief, even though he was a car thief he was still a nice guy and helped save them. The chop shop was VERY mixed with white, black, and Hispanic - in fact when the kids are nervously shaking the row of men's hands you see more white men then black men.  True the blues bar was all black but it was a fun place to be in my opinion so who cares!<br /><br />2) the bus station was mixed with various races.  When the runaway friend called Chris (Elizabeth Shue) it was not a black person who was making her freak out but an old white man yelling at her to get out of his phone booth house.  And the man at the station with the gun - white.  Yes - there was the black lady who took her glasses but it was funny.<br /><br />3) And by the way the gangs on the train were mixed as well with not one color skin standing out more than the other.<br /><br />So to anyone thinking of getting this movie - it's a lot of fun.  I personally love this movie and think it's great!  This movie does not promote racism and it is not laced with racial stereotypes.<br /><br />And to Victor - GET A LIFE!  Readers - watch the movie and pay a little extra attention to the scenes this guy specifies and you will find that he is completely delusional in what he remembers in the movie.  Actually............better yet just enjoy the movie!  It's a classic movie with lots a funny moments.

Now, you'd think that someone would be smart enough to try to exploit and capitalize on his genius, but no, that's not what happens.  Why?  Because his architecture is so terrific that it mocks everyone else's mediocrity.  I'm neither exaggerating nor joking.  And no, this novel is not a satire -- It's really that pretentious.<br /><br />However, THE FOUNTAINHEAD does have one thing going for it: it's unintentionally ironic.  Although Ayn Rand seems to take herself too seriously to consciously incorporate irony into her work, the book's irony lies in the fact that Rand has written an elitist manifesto for the masses.<br /><br />Let's use novelists as an example: In my experience, great writing is most often readily apparent.  On the other hand, I know some unsuccessful writers who think highly of their own writing and rail against mediocrity and \\"the herd\\" in direct response to their failed careers.  Naturally, the problem couldn't be that their novels are pointless unentertaining drivel.  Like the comedian who badgers his audience because it doesn't find him funny, according to Rand, the truly brilliant novel gets rejected because  no one but geniuses possess the vision to see how brilliant the novel is.  This novelist and comedian are the people who love Ayn Rand, because her philosophy of Objectivism allows them so sit in aloof condescension of others yet places no burden on them to reach any level of achievement or recognition in their given field.  After all, true genius gets suppressed by the herd, lest the masses be shamed by the existence of such magnificence.  Therefore, only mediocre writers get published, sell books and win Nobel Prizes, right?  Audiences don't laugh at TRULY funny jokes... ad nauseum.<br /><br />Ironically, of course, THE FOUNTAINHEAD has enjoyed lots of commercial success.  Therefore by Rand's own reasoning, the popularity of The Fountainhead would seem to contradict the ideas it espouses.  Or perhaps Rand doesn't presume her own work to be genius.  Perhaps Rand isn't the pompous, self-congratulatory, pretentious twit that the tone of The Fountainhead might suggest.  Perhaps Rand possesses the humility not to suggest herself to be one of the persecuted geniuses of whom she's so fond of writing.ontradict the ideas it espouses.

0316010669|5.0|Amazing and insightful information written in a very engaging style.  This book can help you be more objective, evaluate opinions of others, avoid prejudice, even help relationships including marriage. Very astute insights to help decision making.  I highly recommend it.
055358202X|5.0|Minimum Maturity Level - Adult  Strong violence.  Strong language.  Sexual situations.    Previous Reading Required - Major  You must read the previous three books, starting with \\"A Game of Thrones\\".    Reading Level - Average  Very easy to follow.    Rate of Development - Extremely Fast  Picks up where \\"A Storm of Swords\\" left off.    The Story - Anything said will be a spoiler.  Mainly for those who haven't read the previous books.      My Suggestion - Highly Recommended  This book pretty much winds down when it comes to the action.  There is still action, but not at such a grand scale as the battle of King's Landing.  There is some shocking moments again, just like how GRRM likes doing it.  I have heard many people gripe about this book but it is still an essential read to keep up with what is going on with all the characters.  Part of the reason of gripes, I would think, is because GRRM had to split this book in two, which is why \\"A Dance of Dragons\\" will feature the other characters that everyone likes so much.  Still, it's a great book to read.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Few movies get five stars from me and this is one that deserves it for the script, the acting, and the direction. Kudos to the producers who had the courage and vision to bring it to the big screen.  I seriously think it should get academy awards and then be re-released.    Timeless and touching, a tribute to those whose decency and perseverance made a difference in the civil liberty of so many.  A movie for those who know the true power of honor. We need more movies like this that entertain, inspire and enlighten. If I could give it more than five stars, I would.     My wife still has the trailer on her myspace and still plays it for motivation. Five stars from her as well. We saw it twice and have pre-ordered the DVD.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Must say that Dexter is one of the best crime drama's in the media today.  It's full excitment and Dexter actually has you feeling for him as a serial killer.  I tend to support Dexter's killings as he only killed guilty people who have done horrible things, those who he kills do not deserve to be alive.  Also the Forensic Blood Spatter information given through the show is quite ture unlike CSI.  I rate Dexter very close to Prison Break as they are related in emotion.  If you like crime drama's this is the best you'll ever get...
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|It took them 3 years after \\"One Day Remains\\" to come up with a new album called \\"Blackbird\\".  New label, but same great sound.  The songs are of high quality and very different.  There are up-tempo songs (Ties That Bound), quite songs (Watch Over You) and the typical Alter Bridge songs like \\"Brand New Start\\" and \\"Wayward One\\" with great solo's.  But the best song is the almost 8-minute song \\"Blackbird\\". Wauw, that is a song I can hear over and over again. Difficult to explain, but listen and shiver!

0143038419|3.0|I work at a bookstore, and this book has been flying out. I picked up a copy to see why. You've gotta admit, it's funny in parts. I don't expect it to have any \\"weight.\\" But if you can keep moving over the speed bumps of neurotic self-indulgence, you can definitely get a few laughs. I'd say it's a quick and enjoyable read, unless you're expecting something with more meat on its bones. Borrow it from a friend: there are plenty of copies out there.
B00005JPQU|5.0|You all keep calling the movie by the wrong name?  It is not Die Hard 4 or 4.0.  The name of the movie is Live Free or Die Hard.      You're all a bunch of morons; it was a great movie if you take it for what it is.  Some of the greatest action scenes I have seen in years!

I'm 66 yrs old, retired law enforcement, served in the military, and have never read such a compelling account of one human beings dedication to one's country.  My hat is off to Marcus Luttrell.  All I can say is; Thank You Marcus,for rejuvenating my patriotism.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I \\"stumbled\\" across Supernatural season one at our local Target store and bought it just for kicks. I am really into the  sci-fi/horror/frankly \\"supernatural\\" genre so I thought what the heck. Good thing it was a Friday night because I watched the whole series in one weekend. I like the music, the plot lines and the family things the brothers and their dad go through. I Just got Season two and did the same with it. Watched it all in two nights. I really think they are worth picking up if you like this type of stuff.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love friends this box set is the best.  If there would be one recommendation I would make is set them apart by season instead of grouping them together in six books.  Also the chapters don't match up on every cd some of them skip thru an episode some of them skip to another scene but I would still buy it again
0312932081|5.0|I first read Ender's Game at the age of 13. I found it on my grandmother's bookshelf, and devoured it within 3 days. Twelve years later, I've read the book at least five times more, and I gain more enjoyment from it every time.<br /><br />The story itself is highly entertaining, simply as sci-fi or popular fiction. This was the first book I ever read in which dialogue was used to introduce each chapter (without identifying either speaker.) The revelation about this dialogue (which I won't spoil) that comes later in the book only reinforced the idea in my mind that OSC was a master of his craft. Anyone who reads the dime-store political garbage that he's written in the past five years or so would do well to remember that his early years were filled with sci-fi masterpieces like Ender's Game.<br /><br />Beyond the entertaining story, there are obvious socio-political undertones inherent in the \\"children as soldiers\\" theme of the book. While the full moral impact of the story didn't hit me when I was 13, at 25, serving in the Army, the story means a great deal more to me. The world we live in today, in which young men and women as young as 17 and 18 are dying on foreign soil, is reminiscent of a world in which humanity lives in such a dire state of fear that they are willing to sacrifice the lives and innocence of an entire generation. The moral quandaries that Ender Wiggin faces mirror the life and death decisions that are put in the hands of soldiers today, still young enough to be called children. And the ending of the book (spoiler alert!), in which an older Ender Wiggin faces the demons of his past and finds redemption, is something that I have seen far too often in our own perilous times.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, Ender's Game is a great read, whether you're simply looking for an entertaining story or a fictional study in ethics. And while the Ender's Shadow series is much more contemporary, I would firmly recommend the original sequels, starting with Speaker for the Dead, if you want to find a satisfying ending to the tale of Ender Wiggin. Hopefully, this book will last for another 20 years.want to find a satisfying ending to the tale of Ender Wiggin. Hopefully, this book will last for another 20 years.

1400097029|1.0|I found this book disappointing. I teach writing, and the novel reminded me of an assignment in which students must write essays using lists of vocabulary words.  The extensive vocabulary employed to describe such a narrow existence and set of circumstances made the novel, at times, appear an odd parody of itself.  Certainly no A la recherche du temps perdu, although it moves at about the same speed.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Not laugh out loud funny, but still hilarious in its own right.  If you're out of school, this movie will bring back floods of memories.  Napolean reminded me of a combination of 2 or 3 kids I knew in high school.  The humor is subtle and understated.  Might not be one for the home library, but is definitely a must-see.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|I am 20 years old so I realize that I wasn't exactly \\"around\\" during Springsteen's glory days of Born To Run, Darkness On The Edge of Town, and The River.  I started following Springsteen's music when I began to play the guitar and tried to do an acoustic version of Thunder Road.  I began collecting his music after that, and currently own all of his records.  While Magic might not be as harsh, dark, and nostalgic as Born to Run or Darkness, it sure matches the songwriting quality. Say what you want about Springsteen personally. Politically egotistic, loud, overbearing...the man can write a damn good song. His ability to craft a song based on not only the emotional constraints of the person, but also the physical is unrivaled among songwriters today. Magic weaves dreary imagery and somber melodies together perfectly and while it might not provide the feeling of uplifting nostalgia as Born To Run did, it leaves you, surprisingly in a state of realization of your own self. It's the first Springsteen album thats fitting for a long drive along the shore on a cool October night. As for the songs themselves....there are a couple duds on the album. Most notably Your Own Worst Enemy and Last To Die. However Livin In The Future, Girls In Their Summer Clothes, Magic, Long Walk Home, and Terry Magovern (bonus track) are some of the best stuff Springsteen has done to date. I would have liked a couple more songs of that magnitude, and yes the sound gets a little overbearing at times. In all, however, this is an incredibly solid piece of work by a songwriter who's style refuses to fade. Hell, I dont think he'll let it fade.
B000AP04L0|3.0|Another great movie here.  If you are sensitive to swearing, then you might want to avoid it (also one brief scene of nudity), but the humor is great.  This is a spot-on \\"caricature\\" of the office environment.  Having worked in this type of workplace for eight years, so much of this movie really hit home and made it that much funnier.  Great performances all around, but especially by Ron Livingston.    I loved the movie, but gave it 3 stars due to the language factor.
034537410X|5.0|I've adopted the exercises in the book and am becoming lucid with increasing frequency, now up to one or two lucid dreams per week.    I think that's about the best compliment you can give a book with this objective.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Okay, so I went out yesterday like many of you did and bought the new AB cd. First let me say this, I was a huge Creed fan and was upset when they broke up. I understood why, but I was still upset. Now when I heard that Mark, Scott, and Brian formed a new band, I was extremely excited. I really liked One Day Remains. I played it a lot and even saw them live. I thought ODR had some great, good, and Ok songs intermingled. Then as soon as they were out, it seemed they just dropped off the face of the earth. I knew they had issues with that crap label Wind-Up and I hoped they would continue with a sophomore release.    Well, all the waiting has paid off. This new CD is so freaking awesome!!!!!!! I like it so much more than ODR. It's as if they have all formed and gelled into an even more solid band than when they first formed as AB and Myles Kennedy is just an amazing singer and a great addition as guitarist. It is obvious that he compliments Mark on every song.    Now for the CD. Well, I bought mine at Best Buy, for $7.99!!!, which came with 2 ADDITIONAL BONUS TRACKS!!!!! Both of these songs rock!! So if you want to have 15 songs, get your CD at Best Buy!!!!!!    Ok, track by track:    1.Ties that Bind - 5 Stars!  2.Come To Life - 5 Stars!  3.Brand New Start - 4.5 Stars  4.Buried Alive - 5 Stars  5.Coming Home - 4.5 Stars  6.Before Tomorrow Comes - I would give this song all the stars in the universe if I could!!!! WHAT AN AMAZING SONG!!!!  7.Rise Today - ALL THE STARS!!!  8.Blackbird - 5 stars  9.One By One - 4 Stars  10.Watch Over You - 5 Stars - VERY Zepplin Like. I love it!  11.Break Me Down - 4.5 Stars  12.White Knuckles - 5 Stars!!!  13.Wayward One - 4.5 Stars  14.The Damage Done (Bonus Track) - 5 Stars - TOO BAD THIS IS NOT ON ALL OF THE CDs. Best Buy Exclusive. This song so FREAKING ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  15.New Way to Live (Bonus Track) - 4 Stars. Good rockin song.    Overall, not one filler song on this CD!!!! This is pure heavy metal! You can rest assured that AB have solidified themselves as a band to contend with and they will continue to gain in popularity and album sales. I hope Wind-Up goes under and regrets how they treated terrific bands like AB.    EDIT UPDATE: I saw Alter Bridge tonight, October 10 at Bogart's in Cincy and I cannot express how tight and amazing they were live. Myles Kennedy's voice is dead on with this album and Mark and Myles compliment each other so much with their playing. If you get a chance to see them, I promise, you won't regret it. If you DO miss them, I guarantee you, it will be your loss and you'll hate yourself for it.     MAY LORD THEY ARE SO FREAKIN AWESOME LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0767836286|4.0|This smart, edgy thriller takes on a whole new power in the aftermath of 9-11.  Made years before the 19 hijackers changed our world and killed 3,000 people on our own American soil, this movie taps into fears that have now already been realized in real life, in ways far more horrific than in its final moments.  Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are the real chillers here, as the are-they or aren't-they next door neighbors.  But the twist to your gut will be that you've lived through this already.  The most frightening thing about it is how familiar it feels in retrospect.

0062502182|5.0|I like this book very much. This is a real adventure with very interest philosophical thoughts. I was slightly disappointed with the book final.

1582701709|3.0|On Page 55 in The Secret, you will read about the difference between taking inspired action (which feels effortless), versus acting to \\"make something happen\\"(which feels like a struggle). Life is described here as a flowing river, and you can either go with the flow of the Universe . . . or against it.  I love this metaphor, but it is not original with The Secret (or the author of this section, Bob Doyle).  In 2004 I read an entire book on this very metaphor by Steven Lane Taylor.  It's called [[ASIN:0974459739 Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide For Living Life In The Divine Flow]].  I think it greatly refines the concepts in The Secret, and I recommend it as a follow-up to this book. It is especially helpful if you want to know how \\"God\\" fits into the picture.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Disney's TRON is the first feature-length film to rely entirely on CGI for all of the special-effects needs, and they managed to pull it off spectacularly. The technologies involved were still in their infancy (and it SHOWS from time to time), but they were good enough to get by on; good enough to prove that it COULD BE DONE, and done WELL. I saw TRON in a theatre on opening day when i was a kid, and I remember being absolutely mind-blown by what I'd just seen: Movies will never be the same again; they'll only get bigger and better - at least in the area of visual-effects.<br /> A 'B+' story, and 'A-' acting helped carry the whole project over the top into cult-classic-dom, laying the groundwork for future CGI-based films ranging from 'The Last Starfighter' to 2007's 'Transformers', as well as the early literary works of William Gibson. Gibson's digital-landscapes and digital-cities seem to me to be the same world that we were introduced to in TRON, but further down the timeline when the societies therein have become over-crowded, slovenly, and decadent - Cyber-Classic fallen to Cyber-Punk... but I digress.<br /> TRON was (and IS) an excellent and highly-entertaining film. Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner both make for great heroes, and David Warner reminds us all why he was so highly sought-after to fill Hollywood's villainous roles. Wendy Carlos' musical score was so perfect that I can't even begin to comment on it; it helped create TRON's world TOO perfectly! The visual effects were amazing when it was first released, and they're still fairly amazing, though they look kind of amateurish by today's standards. But, Hey - This movie's 25 years old, cut it a little slack!<br /> Just go ahead and BUY THIS MOVIE... You won't be disappointed. It might even make you feel young again!

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|IMHO, Annie Lennox is one the UK's greatest singer-songwriters ever!  This CD does not disappoint.  It's has to be Annie's finest since \\"Diva\\".      The material is fresh, profound, playful and occasionally political; yet, it's the music which keeps it moving.  There is no lull in this CD.  Each song could be the 'freatured' song on just about anyone else's CD.    After 25 years of Annie Lennox, this listener is left to wonder - how does she do it and seem to get even better with time?  An amazing talent!!!
B00005JOHC|1.0|I'm soooo sorry to give a bad review because everything I've ever received from you has always been great...but I must be honest. The DVD was not good quality. It skipped ALOT on 3 different episodes. I tried it out on several different DVD players in my home and I'm sure the fault was with the DVD itself and not the player. I couldn't watch even bits and pieces of the shows that were effected. It was just bad.
1416914285|4.0|The book was entertaining, the characters were fun, the plot was twisty enough to warrant the page count, and the setting was gritty and fantastic at the same time.  She also plays with themes a lot: I noticed homages to Star Wars, Buffy, Harry Potter and the Evil Overlord List to name a few.  For the most part these were homages and not ripoffs, and added to the story.<br /><br />You may know she made a name for herself before this writing Harry Potter fanfiction, and if you've read her work, you might notice that a few things from it made it into this book.  I don't know if she included them in her fanfiction as guerilla advertising or what, but as they're good bits and they account for about three of the five hundred pages, it isn't really a problem- it just jumped out at me as I read.<br /><br />Good book, very entertaining overall.
B000SQJ27I|2.0|Manu Chao is quite the interesting cat, with potentially joyous and groundbreaking music that celebrates international culture while slyly resisting globalization. He's got a fresh and intriguing sound that mixes Europop with world music of the Latin/Afro/Caribbean persuasions, with some westernized rock and rhythm mixed in. His lyrics jumping amongst five different languages are also a polyglot delight. With so much going for him, it's hard to imagine how Manu Chao could create such a massively disappointing and annoying misuse of his skills. This album contains 21 largely interchangeable tracks that zoom by with the validity of poorly-designed mashups and with not much more impact than a series of ringtones. The five so-called bonus tracks are merely undeveloped snippets of riffs and melodies that already appeared earlier, and most of the songs overall end quickly after failing to develop a series of very similar basic ideas. This album's production process suffered an ADD-addled breakdown.<br /><br />An ignoramus would say that all the songs sound the same, but here the discerning listener will find that many of them really ARE the same. Five different songs contain the exact same backing tracks with minimally different melodies on top, and even more songs than that contain the same irritating four-note ascending guitar line. Other basic melodies are also recycled (not reprised, mind you) throughout the album. The initially lovely ballad \\"A Cosa\\" also reuses a backing track that Manu contributed to an album by African popsters Amadou & Mariam two years ago. Reprising themes throughout an album can be an effective artistic device, but here it's just widespread replication of undeveloped ideas. Hence, only a few songs in this mishmash can truly stand on their own, such as the sly \\"Politik Kills\\" or the rockin' \\"Rainin in Paradize\\" (which is the first, and only useful,, appearance of that annoying riff). Otherwise, this album is little more than quantities of different manifestations of a very limited number of quality ideas. You may get the feeling that the album takes longer to listen to than it did to record. [~doomsdayer520~]ifestations of a very limited number of quality ideas.

B000OLGCI4|4.0|I hate the word \\"zany\\" though since it implies to me a sense of craziness with no heart or anything of substance. But when you look at it, The Jungle Book was probably one of Disney's more optimistic and overly-joyful outings; from its music to its humor to its voice acting. But it also had, like a lot of Disney films had, a sense of something beyond surface-level that you could get out of it. While certain things about it feel unpolished, it's a good capper on Walt Disney's influential career and a good film on its own.    One day in the jungle, Bagheera the panther finds a small baby in the woods. Not having the heart to abandon it, he decides to leave it with a small wolf pack. Now 10, Mowgli wants to stay in the jungle and be like everyone else but when the feared Shere Khan the tiger is spotted with a loathesome opinion of man, Bagheera has to help Mowgli get to a man-village. But when free-spirited bear Baloo comes in befriending Mowgli and seductive snake Kaa wanting Mowgli for lunch, it becomes harder to get him safely to the village.    Probably best known as Disney's last film before he died in 1966, the Jungle Book is one of those kind of films where others have done better in certain areas yet the film pulls it off anyway. For one thing, the animation is not as impressive as Sleeping Beauty was, the villain doesn't have the presence and staying power like Captain Hook or Cruella Da Vil. And after many a viewings, I still never found the elephant herd likable or even entertaining on some way. As for the rest of the film, what it does have is fun music from the ever-popular \\"Bare Necessities\\" to the infectious \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\".     Make all the jokes you want about DI$NEY and their tendency to favor money and product over art, they're second to none when it comes down to getting the film look pristine and while the animation style looks a bit cruder (which started around 101 Dalmations and continued till the 80's), this is probably the best looking version of the film out there. We also get a making-of and a commentary but then again it's got that Disney tendency of putting in kid's games so it might not be stockful of meaningful info but at least you can say it's stocked.    Parts of me enjoy the Jungle Book but another half of me finds it the least likely candidate of the Platinum releases to get constant replaying but it's a fun movie anyway that kids will no doubt love.    By the way, for those interested, next is 101 Dalmations for Spring and apparently, Sleeping Beauty is being re-released this time next year for Blu-Ray.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|OMG this album is good. Listen to Rise Today and Break me Down and ask yourself how good are these guys? Blackbird puts the final nail into the Creed coffin. Creed who? Alterbridge was good now they're great in their own right.

B000002GBK|4.0|If you only buy one Rick Wakeman album this is the one to get. OK it sounds dated now, and some of the synthesizer sounds are frankly horrible, but in many ways its a classic album.<br /><br />The melodies are its strongest point. There really are some lovely tunes on this album, and they given extra emphasis by some great orchestral arrangements such as on the opening track \\"Arthur\\". There is also superb choral backing by the English Chamber Choir, perhaps most notebly used on the short track 2 \\"Lady of the Lake\\". I had Journey to the Centre of the Earth on vinyl decades ago and there is no comparison. Arthur is superior in every way.<br /><br />The weakest part of the album for me are tracks 6 \\"Sir Galahad\\" and 7 \\"The Last Battle\\". I was never keen on them when I used to listen to the album years ago and to me it sounds as though Rick ran out of ideas towards the end.<br /><br />The fact that punk came along and killed this sort of thing off as part of popular culture doesn't matter, it lives on in the recordings and who knows the next big thing might be the return of Progressive Rock! The great thing that punk did for us was give us the chance to find out that not only is Rick Wakeman a gifted keyboard player but he's also very funny. Go to his concerts and there's a struggling stand-up comedian trying to out.<br /><br />Open your your ears and forget musical prejudices, about Punk and Progessive Rock, just enjoy the music.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I had no idea that this band was releasing a sophmore record, I found out about it 5 days before it was released. I was wondering if Alterbridge was going to record another. Their first album was fantastic. As someone who did listen to Creed I was very upset that they broke up (wasn't a Stapp fan, loved the sound.) When I found out that Alterbridge was Creed without Scott Stapp I was very curious to hear what is was going to be like. The guys of Alterbridge have a huge passion for their music you could hear it in their first cd espeially with the freedom that Mark Tremonte had free from Scott Stapp's grip. This new album is much better than 'One Day Remains'. They have established their sound and the vocals of Myles Kennedy work much better this time around the rest of the bands music. It's also a harder album which is never a bad thing. The songs are great and again go get this album at best buy so you can hear two additional tracks that come with their album release. I sure hope that this band catches on with the masses they really are an underapprecitated band and should be noted for their great work.
0689870280|3.0|I am forever searching for bedtime books because we rotate them out at night and it is always good to find new ones. I was really excited by reading the reviews of this one as we are big fans of Boynton. It is a cute book, but I think it is too short. Perhaps my daughter just likes to have a little more time reading before going to bed but I really wish it was just a few pages longer like some of her others.

B000RJO58M|5.0|I was always a big fan of Hot Fuzz, unlike Shaun of the Dead I thought that Hot Fuzz was actually hilarious, it's one of those movies that I could watch over and over and never get sick of it. And I have been watching my DVD copy over and over, so I know the DVD version pretty well. But after watching the HD DVD version all I can say is \\"wow\\". The jump in quality for HD DVD is amazing, it looks SO much better on high definition. The fight scene in the supermarket looks so vibrant now, you can read all the labels, you can clearly see the splatter of tomato sauce, everything looks phenomenal. The soundtrack is also pretty amazing, in Dolby True HD the music really jumps out at you. It's like watching at the movies all over again.    Hot Fuzz on HD DVD is definately the movie I will be showing my friends to show off my HDTV set up and my sound system. HD DVD made one of my favourite movies even better, so I cannot give it anything less than five stars.
0060578793|5.0|This book is gold.  If you decide to donate money to homeless people STOP.  Donate this book instead.  They will be able to live forever with the helpful survival tips in this book.  It sits on my coffee table and has been a talking point with everyone who sees it.  It has everything in it - including 'Emergency Child Birth in the Bush'.  The trapping and food sections are amazing.  This book was everything and much more than I thought it would be.  Easily the best few dollars I ever spent on a book.  Thanks to the sling traps I have no more stray cats claiming my yard as their own!  Then using this book I was able to skin, prepare and cook these cats.  I was also able to discard the offal that was not nutrient dense.  Note: No cats have really been caught or cooked yet - but I could if I wanted to.

B000TGJ7ZY|2.0|I am only going to comment on my opinion of the Blu Ray picture quality  relative to other Blu Rays I have seen.  I have watched about 30 Blu Ray disks so far on my 1080P SONY 40 inch  LCD screen using a Sony Blu Ray player. This movie seems to be one of the poorest so far.  Some of the best I have seen include Curse of the Golden Flower,  the 2nd Blu Ray release of The Fifth Element and even Blazing Saddles.

Many explanations of the movie are here so I won't bore you.  Not enough \\"Punch Lines\\" if you know what I mean, don't let me scare you away from this movie though.  It was fun and positively humorous, but not and A+ movie, not even \\"Airplane\\" funny, more like.....well, a serious movie with \\"trying to be funny\\" like..........dang wut movie is ALMOST funny....anyway, you get my drift, a perfect one timer if you've got nothing else to do......except drink a few and laugh at this movie.....

0374280967|4.0|Two features especially distinguish this refreshingly wicked novella and deserve to be singled out from among those of its many strengths already mentioned. First, through satiric wit, its author adroitly exaggerates the Queen's and the rest of the House of Windsor's odd reality, including in the account its bootlicking or cutthroat staff members, and even its recent, non-literary Prime Minister, Tony Blair. What lies just beneath the surface of this recourse to the amusingly exaggerated is, in fact, the revelation of a harsher, more distressing everyday kookiness which is attributed to most of these characters. In other words, under the flower, an asp. Second, the author stuffs his tale with a host of epigrams, some just about worthy of Oscar Wilde. For example, when the now voraciously reading Queen Elizabeth turns at last to writing and defends her practice against the charge of singularity, she speaks of earlier Royals who've authored books, saying \\"my great grandmother Queen Victoria...wrote a book also...and a pretty tedious book it is, too, and so utterly without offense as to be almost unreadable.\\" Such a high-spirited observation - and it is typical of many - rivals the quotable dialogue of the most successful manners comedies, resembling that of \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" in particular.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|I bought \\"Death Proof\\" without prior knowledge of it, based solely on Kurt Russell being in it and a promised car chase.    Kurt Russell was in it but I have to feel he has fallen on hard times to have taken this acting job. This was not close to the standard or quality of his other movies I've seen and enjoyed. If you liked Russell before don't buy this DVD.    As to the car chase it was at best amateurish with scenes cutting out just before the car actually crashes, cars doing things that just can't be done (radiators can not withstand the beating given etc). Seems they don't feel this type of action is great without being impossible. Car action fans will be disappointed.     There may be a segment of the public that will like this DVD but if you fall in the category of a Russell fan or a motorhead this is a waste of your money.
B000UFAURI|5.0|The song is different with each album and each time I have to spend a couple of days listening to get use to the new sound. Not with this album. I loved it upon first hearing it. Dave wrote to my soul again and it makes me so happy. There is a transition through this album. It's heavy at the start and continues to be heavy with a soft undertone to it as the album progresses. Once again they introduce a different style. It makes me think that Taylor got his hands dirty toward the end of the CD and it's awesome. I love the changes they have undergone but I love that they have a little something for those of us who have been there from the beginning. For those of you disappointed, People change. They grow up. They mature. The sound can't always be the same. It would get boring. The Foo Fighters always evolve which is why they are still here. Dave, Nate, Taylor and Chris: keep rockin and I will always keep listening!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Back in 2004, I wrote a 5-star review for 'One Day Remains', and I believed then as I do now that it was far and away the best rock record of '04.  Fast forward 3 years, and 'Blackbird' is far and away the best rock record of 2007, and it is no small compliment to say that this record is even better than their debut.    Upon hearing the opening 'Ties That Bind' for the first time, the melody was so memorable that it inexorably lodged itself in my brain upon just the one listen - for starters, that's a good sign.  The album then gives way to songs that fall somewhere between sludgy metal anthems, power-ballads and riff-driven mid-tempo thrashers (with many songs incorporating all three templates into remarkable cohesive arrangements).    Highlights include the hard-driving yet melancholic 'Brand New Start', the sorrowful 'Watch Over You' and the spine-chilling title track, which clocks in at 7:58, without one second of filler therein.  This song is an absolute masterpiece.    Hats off to Tremonti, Phillips, Kennedy and Marshall for exceeding everyone's expectations and writing a truly great rock record.  It may be years before we hear another straight-ahead hard rock album this good.
0345350499|2.0|I am a big Arthurian legends buff, but am not thrilled about this book. It was kind of like coming home only to see that someone had rearranged your furniture while you were away. Additionally, I have no problem being critical of Christianity, but the way Gwenhwyfar is re-written into a Christian strawman to be knocked down is unfair at best, inauthentic to character, and a pathetic and tasteless way to make a point. Telling the story from the women's point of view is an excellent idea, but rewritting the women and the legend to push an agenda and a different story is, again, in poor taste. This could have been written with completely different characters and without the Arthurian back drop and still have told the same story. The question, then, is why not set it in a purely fictional land with new characters? The author is (ab)using our familiarity and trust of the legend/history to get the reader to buy into her agenda, like any good piece of propaganda would do. Christian critique, fine, tasteful feminism, yea! but don't feed it into our subconscious behind the eyes of a familiar face like we don't have the capacity or right to discuss the social dilemas openly... propaganda, no thank you.

Once it arrived, I listened to the whole thing while at work and was pleasantly surprised.  I like almost every song on the CD and it's what's in my CD player in my car regularly.  I find the songs original, upbeat, and refreshing.  I think this band has a promising future ahead and I will definitely buy their next CD when it comes out.

B0000UJL96|5.0|This movie by far is an explemplar of what Star Trek can be, and should be. I provides amazing social commentary on the human condition and historical comtemporary references to Soviet relations in the late 1980's.     Also, this movie delves into the characters of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy once more and fleshes out their characters for on last hurrah. Overall, this movie is supurb.
0141439661|5.0|Sense and Sensibility is about the Dashwood girls Elinor and Marianne.<br />The time is the Napoleonic years of the nineteenth century though nothing so sordid as the little Corporal's baleful visage will appear in this novel of domestic romance.  The girls are forced to leave their home following the death of their father. The estate they live at is invaded by their dullard half brother John and his insufferable wife. The two girls, their mother and younger sister Margaret are off to the West of England to live at Barton Cottage being supported by John the brother.<br />  In this novel Miss Jane Austen tells two convoluted love stories. Elinor who is the oldest and most sensible of the girls is in love with Edward Farrars. Farrars is an Oxford man who eventually goes into the ministry. He has been involved in a longterm engagement to the odious but ambitious Lucy Steele. Elinor is heartbroken at this lost love but keeps her stiff upper lip in order to minister to the needs of her younger and more emotional sister Marianne.<br />  Marianne is in love with the rake Willoughby who has had a torrid affair with Eliza Williams. He jilts Marianne but lives to rue his rejection of her.<br />  As in all Austen novels all is resolved with a wedding. Elinor will eventually wed Edward Farrars and live in a parsonage. Her sister Marianne will become Mrs. Brandon as she weds an older and wiser man<br />Colonel Brandon.<br />  Along the way we meet the lovable Mrs. Jennings, the fautous Steele sisters and Robert Ferrars the stupid brother of Edward Ferrars. Mr. and Mrs. Palmer are also satirically viewed as a dull married couple living in luxury.<br />  It amazes me that no one in a Jane Austen novel really works! As Emma Thompson who directed the film \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" quipped one wonders why these women don't go out and get a job!  In an Austen novel there are the inevitable long walks and conversations, mixed romantic signals with mixups aplenty and the occasional dance across the ballroom floor.<br />  Austen can be tedious and it can be a challenge to keep up with the characters and conversations. She is a great artist with a very narrow focus; a few middle class families living in the country with a love story to be told. Within this baliwick she is peerless, witty and wise. She brings a few hours of quiet where the only sound heard is a bird singing or a carriage rumbling up to the house.<br />  Sense and Sensibility published in 1811 is a classic of English literature. Jane Austen is unsurpassed in the realm of Regency romance!across the ballroom floor.<br />  Austen can be tedious and it can be a challenge to keep up with the characters and conversations.

You can listen to this cd from beginning to end without wanting to skip any songs, and her lyrics are powerful, as always.  Whether you're a long-time fan of Pink, or someone just wanting to take a listen because you heard a couple good songs on the radio from this album, you won't be disappointed!

B000VBIEXS|4.0|Ok, Shout Factory listened to all of our complaints about the wrong mix of the \\"Brain Salad\\" songs on the \\"Essential ELP.\\" They found the correct original LP mix! However, \\"Karn Evil 9 First Impression Part 1\\" is muffled. It sounds like someone threw a blanket on top of it. It gets brighter for Part 2. The old Rhino CD from the 1990's sounds better on Part 1, but overall, this Shout Factory reissue is superb, especially the packaging!
0152048049|1.0|I love the style in which this book was originally translated from French to English. There was a genuine, child-like quality to it that rang true to the books character and that of it's charming little prince. The new translation  took me by surprise as I was not aware that it had been re-translated and sadly, the surprise was not a happy one. It just doesn't feel like the same book to me, and tragically, the original translation appears to be out of print now. Why in God's name did they feel the need to fix something that was in no way broken? Ghaaaa! Child-like and genuine has been replaced by rigid and sterile. The Little Prince would weep. :(
B000001FS3|5.0|It was the spring on 2002, I was on my way to Las Vegas on a bus driving through the desert.  My dad had lent me his \\"Joshua Tree\\" CD. At that time, the only other album I had heard by U2 was \\"Achtung Baby\\" which was very hard for me to like at that time time.  As I sat on the bus we passed by hundreds of Joshua Trees twisting and stretching towards the clear desert sky.  Ever since, this album brings back memories of the desert and my first real introduction to what would become my favorite plant; The Joshua Tree.<br /><br />  Upon first listen this album almost sounds dead and disjointed beyond \\"With or Without You\\" because a lot of the tracks are low-key or just have a really old kind of dry feeling to them.  It seems what U2 did (for me at least) was able to take Biblical themes of water (Almost ever songs mentions water, rain drops/fall, or rivers) and dryness (several songs talk about dryness and the desert) with the metaphor of a desert and put it in an album.  The album IS the desert.<br /><br />  Beyond the first three tracks of the album \\"God's Country\\" feels like a road trip in the desert.  \\"Running to Stand Still\\" feels like a slow motion picture of the desert and \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" and \\"One Tree Hill\\" continue that momentum.<br /><br />  On this album, the desert and U2 are.  Almost all of the tracks bring back pictures of the cracked and dried ground of the desert floor or the blistering hot sun.  Thematically, I would call this U2's best album, it is almost a concept album and it succeeds in painting a glorious vision of a life dead and dry like the desert springing back to life in the midst of adversity, much like desert plants such as the Joshua Tree can even survive.<br /><br />  My advice; buy this album now and take a road trip through the mojave desert, you will not be sorry.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

0156027321|5.0|I kinda would like to rate this book a 4, because there are a few things I didn't like. I didn't like everything getting 'over-explained' in the end. That wasn't necessary. It was like the author didn't think the reader was smart enough to keep track of what was going on. That did a real disservice to the book.    And I didn't like all the start - I mean, too much opinion that seemed like an rookie blog.    But, I did recommend the book, and I wanted my Mom to read it and talk to her about it. So, what does that say? I don't do that too often. So, I gotta give it a five.    Read it and tell me what you think. :)
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Great Movie.   How come few are rating DVD quality of this movie now when the DVD is about to release on 9th of NOV. Bit confusing commnets. Isn't it?
0385486804|5.0|I just finished reading this book again after 10-years. With the movie release in Sep 07, I wanted to be current on the book so that I could compare mental notes with the movie. I particularly enjoyed sharing the mindset of the main character through Jon's careful research into his life. Before judging Chris' actions you should remember that he is young, and to put yourself back at his age. If you like this book, you may also enjoy the accounts of TJ Burr in \\"Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection\\". TJ's book is similar to \\"Into the Wild\\" as an account of a young person's love for the wilderness and high country adventure. It is getting harder to find copies of this book, but some are still available.

Yes, his wild adventure cost him his life, but I think he was happy in the end, and I think that's all that matters!

This is a dramatic, visceral, intense, delicate and brief novel about love in a wrong time. Sometimes, we realize that it was only the wrong time but it is too late. The way he describes how Edward remembers Florence after many years and how he receives traces of Florence's life after finding that her musical group played a successful piece that was so important in her life.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|I thoughly enjoyed this movie and equally love the CD. A great mix of Irish-flavoured music - some quiet, some dramatic ballards, and other more raucous Irish-jamming type songs.  Can listen to it over and over.  Also loved by my 6 yr old!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|I love Kanye West so I love this album, I never thought he could do better than Jesus Walks or Golddigger but he surely can.
074325144X|4.0|I'm a beginning runner and found the concepts in the book very valuable -- from how to position my body to the ideal attitude.   More importantly, I gave this book to two people who have been running for some time and do full marathons. Each of them thought the book very beneficial and have begun applying the principles to enhance their own style.   Since the techniques are based on martial arts principles (I'm a black belt), anyone involved in the fighting arts will appreciate the lessons -- whether you want to run or not.
0061148512|5.0|Great book!  Beautifully written.  It is a novel that I plan to keep on my bookshelf indefinitely.
0060594896|5.0|This is the thickest self help book I ever read, 435 pages of content. However, it's a real page turner. I finished it within two days and learned a lot. I like the detailed breakdown (64 principles/chapters), the good stories and quotes supporting each principle, and the excellent writing skill of the author. It's no exaggeration to describe this as the shortcut/summary/spirit of the \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" series. I have read over 50 self help books and I seldom recommend them to my friends, but this book and the book [[ASIN:1434322580 Understanding: Train of Thought]], are the two that deserve it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Unlike many letterbox tv shows on dvd which have black bars recorded above and below the 16x9 shape image area to fill the 640x480 video frame, this disk appears to be encoded so that the Toshiba HD-DVD player treats it like an HD-DVD disk. The image quality looks almost indistinguishable from the Serenity HD-DVD disk and better than most off-air HDTV programs.     To me the Firefox series has a magical quality far above most tv shows.
B000MG1ZFQ|5.0|With \\"The Soft Parade,\\" The Doors attempted to create their own St. Pepper's with a full orchestra accompanying the band on about half the tracks on the album.  The album is truly the band's Beatleesqe pop record and in many ways they did here what The Rolling Stones did with \\"Their Satanic Majesty's Request.\\"      The songwriting on The Soft Parade is a differnt affair compared to their first two records, because the band's psychadelic, poetic, hard drivin blues takes a backseat to a more commercial pop sound - fused with more ambitious, less accessible songwriting.  Songs like \\"Tell All The People\\" and \\"Touch Me,\\" and \\"Wishful Sinful\\" display a poppier, less dangerous side of the band, while \\"Shaman Blues,\\" \\"Runnin Blue,\\" and \\"The Soft Parade\\" song suite are some of the most ambitious work in the band's catalog.      I will admit that I don't enjoy this album nearly as much as \\"Strange Days\\" or \\"LA Woman\\" but that's just because those two albums ARE The Doors.  This isn't their signature sound......it's their attempt to be The Beatles and it doesn't suit them as well.    However, I do think this album is good listen and great for what it is.  The Doors were panned by critics and fans alike upon release of this record saying they were \\"a spent force.\\"  But the band is in top notch, Morrison's voice is in great shape, and the end of The Soft Parade Suite\\" where Jim says, \\"This is the best part of the trip\\" is awesome, classic Doors.  They definitely get an A for effort here.  An interesting album that's definitely different than anything else they ever did as a band again, I'd recommend checking this one out after exploring the other offerings in the band's catalog.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Lovely combination of voices, so cool and easy.  Listen whenever I'm under pressure (or not)....it brings me back down.
B000VBIEXS|5.0|You say you've already got a copy of Brain Salad Surgery...and you're wondering if you need this version?    Well, the sound is excellent, the two bonus cuts are quite good, the booklet has informative liner notes and very good photos and is definitely a value add.  The music is 5 star classic (on any scale) and the original cover and poster have been recreated and made available in this release.    For an example of a less than stellar remastering and repackaging job, see my review of Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Spectres\\".  In terms of quality of remastering of the product there's simply no comparison - this release of BSS is clearly the better value for the money.    This is a perfect example of what the \\"record\\" companys need to be doing with their back catalogues in order to justify all us old rock dawgs spending money on product (again!).  This is my money very happily (and well) spent!  Love it!    Buy it!
0316067598|5.0|One of the most inspiring stories I've ever heard.  I bought the unabridged audiobook and I'm assuming it's essentially the same as the hardback in terms of content.  In the audiobook, the narrator makes this story come alive while mixing in a bit of humor to lighten it up.  This is helpful as parts of this book will leave you reaching for a tissue to dry your eyes.  It's told in a way that makes it very easy to get through.  I run my own company and have a busy work schedule to say the least.  Even still, I finished this book in 1 day.  I simply couldn't stop listening to it; it's that good.
B00005NGAK|5.0|I kept watching this video online and finally just had to buy it.  It's wonderful!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Mary Poppins, what else needs to be said.  My children, who claim to be too cool for this old film, thoroughly enjoyed it.
159448385X|5.0|This book sucked me in from the first page and then wouldn't let me go. Hosseini's latest novel is one that resonates deep inside of a person and it is both heart-warming and tragic. This is a story of friendship, love, loss, survival.....and just about life in general. It is the story of two women who struggle to make a place for themselves in a world in which they are considered to be less than nothing. There are many books out that that a person can read and then forget shortly after reading them but this story isn't like that. This is a story that will stay with a person long after its read. I had planned to say something else here, but when the time came I just couldn't put my thoughts into words. A Thousand Splendid Suns is just one of those stories that you must read for yourself to fully understand the power and the beauty that it contains.<br />[...].
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Get it, and get the soundtrack too, because the music is incredible.
B000VD5I94|1.0|Let's charge $30 for a Blu Ray release of a highly coveted classic catalog title and give it a substandard transfer.  Let's only include a fraction of what we include on the new DVD release so that the consumer who wants the best possible version of the film is forced to buy them both.  Let's tout the impressive storage space available on the Blu Ray format as a selling point and not use it.  If only we could REALLY rape the consumers like we did in the laser disc days.  Oh well... this is almost as good.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Have watch this a long time ago and I truly enjoy it back then and when I saw it's available in Amazon I immediately purchase the DVD and now my kid loves it too, he finds it really hilarious...and he gets it.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|The third of his 'college' series provides a different feel than the previous two.  A more feel good, relaxing vibe is definitely evident.  Although I miss the skits kanye usually has on his albums (there are only 14 tracks), I can't get enough of his samples and creative collaborations.  A definite must-buy for any Kanye and even non-Kanye fan alike!
B000RW3YYA|5.0|I really enjoyed this season of SG/Atlantis. I felt like we got to know some of the characters a little better, especially Ronon. But losing Beckett was a real heart-breaker- He was one of my favorites (his brogue was so charming!)- Maybe he can come back as an Ascended being (ala Daniel Jackson!) I can't wait until season 4 comes out in DVD, (since we don't have TV in our home), and see what Samantha does with Atlantis (although I will really miss Elizabeth- why can't they both stay?) It broke my heart when SG1 was cancelled, but SG/Atlantis will hopefully fill the void!
0307341550|3.0|This book is TOO MUCH.  Too much sex, too much alcohol, too much drug use, too much self-mutilation, too many people intent on the destruction of themselves and others.  The narrator and her family could be poster children for the 21st century version of any Grimms fairy tale (only without the happy ending).<br /><br />The narrator, Camille Preaker, a reporter (with more than a few problems of her own) returns to her home town to investigate the murder of two young girls.  The town of Wind Gap harbors more than it's share of bizarre characters and would be an excellent place to set up practice if you happen to be a psychiatrist in search of a new client base.<br /><br />We have a self-centered, irrational mother;  an out of control half-sister, high school friends all displaying symptoms of neurotic behaviour, murder victims who are less than sympathetic, and a group of insidious teen-aged girls who could have stepped out of a work by John Saul or perhaps Edgar Alan Poe.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn writes of her unhinged creations; malovolent females, victims and victimizers, poisoness environments,  with such clarity and knowledge, it makes one wonder about the childhood of this writer.<br /><br />All in all, not a very pretty tale.....but one that does stay with you like a bad dream. Two and a half stars.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|One of the best series i've ever seen. Action, Drama, suspense... If you like Ghosts, Vampires and supernatural things have it for sure!!!!
B000092Q7O|5.0|This has to be one of the very best Holocaust films ever made not just because of Polanski's talents but his sensibility as a Holocaust survivor.  The film based on Wadyslaw Szpilman's life tells a story of the survival of the human spirit in extreme adversity and his encounter with a German Officer Wilhelm Hosenfeld who helped him in his hiding.  Don't miss Disc 2 with the bonus material on the making of the film and the interviews with the cast and crew.  Polanski sums it all up in his interview saying \\"... I saw the cast who was dressed up as the Nazi monsters in the movie-screening again as they actually are - they are Germans with earrings....charming, intelligent and delightful people and really nice people and that was a shock to me...and I come to the realisation that anyone is capable of anything, at a given time in history...The audience will walk away with the lasting emotion...and identify with the victims of that period and I hope that this film may somehow contribute to the efforts of those who don't want this type of scenario re-occur in the nearest future.\\"    Hat off to a Master Film-Maker and the rest of the cast and crew.  This is a brilliant and extraordinary film which earns the well deserved Oscars for Polanski (Best Director); Adrien Brody (Best Actor) and Ronald Harwood (Best adapted Screenplay) and watch out for the very fine performance of Thomas Kretschmann who plays the German officer.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|*PYLLAMYD ROCKS*<br />More down and dirty riffage, more down-south attitude, more down-tempo moshy-worthy metal sludgery... more DOWN - at last! This one never lets up. There are less breaks in intensity and the whole album has a cohesiveness to it that allows you to put it on repeat and keep bangin' all night. Some say they've changed or that it sounds different. WhatEver. Some even say they've lost their steam? Those who enjoy their other bands know this can never be true. I sort of think of DOWN as their art project.<br /><br />This is classic DOWN. If you like them, you should already have it.<br />*PILLAMYD ROCKS*

159102594X|4.0|For those of us frustrated with the complete lack of action in the last 4 installations in the Wheel of Fire series by the late Robert Jordan (with all due respect - I'm pissed off that I ever picked up The Eye of the World), The Blade Itself is loaded with it. Correction - it is practically bursting at the seams and ready to explode with it. Sure the writing isn't as eloquent as Kay or as bold and articulate as Martin. This guy is not in their class. But so what? He's a hell of a good story teller and gets your blood pounding and your heart racing. And in spite of what the review in Publishers Weekly says, most of the characters are in fact likable - mainly because of their very human flaws and shortcomings. If you are an avid reader of the epic fantasy genre you'll chew through this in a week.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|While this album is no \\"Born to Run,\\" it is still unreal.  This album is just plain amazing!  Buy it!  Seriously...buy it.
B000SQJ2SC|5.0|the title fits the music quality on the album to the tee and the whole concept,sound,creativity,craft and vision of the album graduation is totally amazing and utterly genius if you ask me it's what you would want from an album and more. Every song captures a different moment of how he feelings and his point of view on everything and whats going on today and it takes you on a ride of basically what goes on in the life and mind of kanye west. Mr west has really done it with this album from the lyrics to the beats to the concept of every song to the meaning of the whole album to the music material and message he's tryna showcase and put out there to everyone the whole entire album goes together so well. i really love the album and if your into music thats serves a purpose,great quality and really talks about something important,interesting,different and unique then i suggest and recommend that you purchase this cd bottom line. If your a fan it's Worth the hassle,worth the hype and definitely worth the money so go out and support but if your it's worth trying out and listening to give it a go you might like it depending on the type of music you listen to so dont be nieve by playing it safe,staying in the box or just sticking to what you know b-cuz how would u ever determine what's good or bad if you're never willing to try something new. Don't be afraid to experiment and try out new things broaden up your horizon and diversity towards everything else or you'll surely miss out on alot of good things in life.
B000002P6R|3.0|These were really strange times for the Who. Keith Moon was dead and replaced (how could you really replace Moon?) with Kenny Jones, formerly of the (Small) Faces on drums. It was the beginning of a new decade and music was changing. If I remember correctly, Roger Daltrey was against a permanent replacement for Moon, and butted heads with the other two over this issue. . They decided to tour before they put out an album. When they did release an album the result was Face Dances. It seems the band were a bit restrained on this one. They didn't play with the same abandon as they did on earlier records. Jones was a more disciplined drummer than Moon and it probably had a great deal to do with the songs being more low key and \\"arranged\\" than earlier work. To me, the best songs are You Better, You Bet, Don't Let Go the Coat, and Another Tricky Day. The remaining songs just don't cut it for me. Entwistle's songs seemed to have fallen off in quality on recent albums, and the two on this album were sort of mundane. Gone was the quirky quality that made John's songs special. Daltrey, not being a writer, was left to interpret songs by Townshend that he probably couldn't relate to very well. All in all, it seems the Who were trying too hard to remain relevant instead of just remaining the Who.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I never thought that I would say this about anything related to Pride and Prejudice but this was an awful adaptation.  keira knightly is nothing like Elizabeth Bennet.  Darcy resembles a farmer more then a gentlemen.  Really awful.

B000002J03|4.0|...and perfect for a road trip into the past.  Seemed a little lighter than I recall, but that may just be the difference between vinyl & CD.
0307275639|5.0|This was an excellent book that I enjoyed reading. It really makes you think about life and everything you've ever done. It teaches you to love without consequence and to be who you've always wanted to be. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Well written, exceptional action, good plot that appeals to men and women with some love story storyline and a good amount of well done fight scenes.
055358202X|2.0|I think he could have made this a five book series rather than a seven.  While I have enjoyed the format and the character development, and the plot twists, its started to get hackneyed.  Every time you start to take an interest in a character they are cruelly maimed or killed.  We get it, life is tough, and if you are in any way involved with anyone in power, you are going to die a horrible death.  If you are a nobody, you still die horribly, but with less ink.  If you are cute and spunky, you die slower.  And if we start to run out of the hundreds of cannon fodder characters, we just introduce new ones.      I don't know if I'm going to buy the next book.
B00008GKEG|5.0|An excellent DVD. Great videos, interviews and, of course, great music.  Subtitles: portugues, german, spanish among others.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a great series. It's not really a sci-fi series. It's a deep character focused drama/comedy. The setting just happens to be in the future where space travel is common. What's best about the series is the deep character development. You'll love all the characters differently, but you will love them.
B000UZ4G8M|4.0|I LOVE Grey's Anatomy.  Huge fan.  Never miss an episode.  Love the soundtracks too.  Season two ended up as my most played - followed by season one - season three was a bit disappointing compared to how awesome the music is during the show.  But I was very happy with the three disc set overall.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|After seeing Season 1, who could stop there? Season 2 is as good as the first one, and the acting was great. I totally enjoyed the whole second season and hope there will be a 3rd DVD set when it (3rd year) is finished. This one ended on a cliffhanger. Acting again was perfect for Padalecki and Ackles as brothers working together to get rid of demons and things that go bump in the night. I hope this series will last several more years, I am hooked.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|One words sums up this movie: Awful. It's slow, boring, and terribly acted. It feels like someone making a Tarantino ripoff. I think that the biggest problem is that the actresses do not sound believable or natural spouting Tarantino dialogue. The only remotely credible actors are Kurt Russell, who seems to realize that he's in an awful movie and hams it up accordingly, and Rosario Dawson, who at leasts sounds like a real person. The worst offenders are the black lady driver, who sounds about as tough as Sarah Silverman when she's talking like Sammy Jackson, and Zoe Bell, who needs acting lessons badly. Tarantino gives us no reason to feel bad for the first group of gals--they're catty and obnoxious--and no reason to believe that the second group would go after Stuntman Mike. The ending is laughable as the gals suddenly morph into Charlie's Angels. Despite all its faults, the movie isn't a complete washout. The car scenes earn one star; and Dawson's mouth, Poitier's legs, and butterface Bell's body combine for another star.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I am new to the show after reading a lot of FanFic stories I decided I needed to see what the hype was all about. Once I started watching the series, I couldn't stop. I don't care for horror shows/movies but this isn't tho there are some icky looking things there. I totally am enjoying watching and can't stop. The actors, Jarad Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are wonderful together and seem to really get along, as brothers and close friends. (besides being good looking too! LOL)
B000GFRDN6|4.0|Is it just my copy or does anyone else notice that \\"Space Intro\\" on the 5.1 mix is drastically edited???  That track prepares you for \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" mentally, emotionally and spiritually, and to have it be virtually non-exsistent just tore me up inside (well, almost).    My wounds were healed, however, once Steve Miller brought forth my guitar hero, Joe Satriani, on stage.  Very unexpected but very satisfying!    The interview segment is very cool. Get it and enjoy!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|\\"Blackbird\\" is excellent! Alter Bridge has made an excellent second album worth listening to. All of the songs on here are excellent.    Track Listing  1. Ties That Bind  2. Come To Life  3. Brand New Start  4. Buried Alive  5. Coming Home  6. Before Tomorrow Comes  7. Rise Today  8. Blackbird  9. One By One  10. Watch Over You  11. Break Me Down  12. White Knuckles  13. Wayward One
B00025ETIW|5.0|This has to be my most favorite album.  Everytime I hear it, I become more and more awestruck.  The horror rich theme and goulish lyrics are a fantastic compliment to the sharp, violent melodies.  Each song has an underlining of sadness.  I could listen to a song with a smile on my face, yet still feel like crying. It's just so good.  MCR is in a class by themselves.  No one else compares.  Three cheers and five stars for this amazing album and amazing band.
0811828697|5.0|I love this book. It's particular combination of pretty art and extraodinary imagination make this a book a great colectionist article for every Star Wars fan.
1400032717|3.0|Light, pretty easy ready.  Mark does a great job of narrating from an autistic teen's POV.  However, that was about it for me.  Didn't get too wrapped up in the actual story line, I just enjoyed the frame of reference.
0735619670|5.0|This book covers a lot of great ideas. It is easy to read because it is full of relevant examples. It is not dry or boring (Even if you have an understanding of the topic). It also gives guides on what you can skip over if you are familiar with the topic.<br /><br />We use this book in our Software Design and Analysis class. Everyone seems to find it useful. And although it is a Microsoft Press book it gives examples in other languages. It is mostly Java and C/C++.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|This is one of those films that surprises you with it's warmth,wit and off-beat attitude. I first saw it flipping through the channels while I was in a particularly \\"disintersted\\" mood. I expected to flip the channel again within a few minutes but pleasently found myself quickly drawn into the characters and the story. The cast and the screenplay are endearing, as is the musical score. It's just a small sweet movie, nothing more.
1596680180|3.0|A book with lots of ideas and clear instructions.  However, I would have been happier if they had shown more applications for the various braids as well as instructions on how to apply the braids.  Overall I am happy I made the purchase and will use the book for finishing needlepoint projects.
0316018953|1.0|I always like the way that Michael Connelly has to approach the description of crimes and love his Harry Bosch character. Unfortunately, this last book is way behind his standard.
1400079179|2.0|I typically don't read books that have been hyped up by the general public.  A few of my friends, however, suggested that I check it out.  So I did.  While I don't regret reading it, I would never recommend it to anyone.  Brown pretty much lost me when he described the main character as a \\"bookish Harrison Ford\\" that is a professor at an ivy league university.  This character is about to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail...  I saw that movie over 15 years ago... it's called \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\\"  The characters all lack depth, and the riddles were mindless (I solved the first one as soon as it was presented, and the second maybe a few pages before the characters did.)  I'd never read another one of his books.
B00002MHS1|5.0|This was begun as a solo record for Steve Winwood to be entitled: \\"Mad Shadows\\". Steve had completed two tracks: \\"Stranger To Himself\\" & \\"Every Mother's Son.\\" All the instruments {including drums} were played by Steve. There is more than one story, but, my favorite is that Steve just missed working with Jim & Chris, and after producer, Guy Stevens departed after the first sessions for this project, (returning to working with: \\"Mott The Hoople\\"), Traffic was very much alive once more.<br /><br />Steve Winwood, Chris Wood and Jim Capaldi had grown as musicians since the break-up of Traffic in early 1969 and this record in it's maturity shows how different their music now was from the 67-69 edition of this great group.<br /><br />\\"Glad\\", with it's jazz/funk groove leaves no doubt that this new music was developed from a jam. But, this is very polished & refined BUT not overdone (as was commom for music of 1970) Steve's, organ and piano just sparkle in the mix featured here, and the flutes & saxophones really make this piece grow into something special. \\"Freedom Rider\\" also benefits from the fine sax by Chris (his phasing and that certain note that he 'bends'). \\"Empty Pages\\" closed the first side of the LP, and it's the closest thing here to classic Traffic, on this album, this was the track that received the most plays on the FM stations of this era. A bonus track comes next called: \\"I Just Want To Know.\\" This track is almost a 'throwaway' and it should not dropped intp the middle of the original record as it really messes with the flow of the music. This should have been tacked on at the end of the CD.<br /><br />Side Two begins with: \\"Stranger To Himself\\", and this is a strong rock number with some fine guitar work from Steve. \\"Stranger\\" would have made a great addition to the \\"Blind Faith\\" album, but it sure is a great addition found here. The title track is the main reason this Record was tagged with this being Traffic's folk-rock album, but I find Traffic's arrangement of this Traditional tune more modern than the versions that you are going to find as recorded by Fairport Convention and/or Jethro Tull. The closer of the original record was: \\"Every Mother's Son\\" and it's another fine rocker with a great guitar solo by Steve, that you will find on the fade-out.<br /><br />This Deluxe Edition has more bonus tracks located at the end of the disc. \\"Sittin' Here Thinking of my Love\\" is a studio track that missed inclusion on The original record, it's O.K. but because of time limitations back in 1970's record albums, this one has remained in it's tape tin until now. But, that's not all...At the end we get a taste of what was to been released as: \\"Traffic, Live November 1970\\" with a live: \\"Glad\\" \\"Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring\\" and my personal favorite of the bunch: \\"Backstage & Introduction\\"...While Bill Graham is introducing the band and the light show, they casn be heard standing in the wings having a VERY INTERESTING conversation, and all of this is included because someone was carrying a tape recorder and captured this golden moment in time for all of us to witness. It is a great little peak into the rock world of 1970 and this is indeed, quite a find!<br /><br />I'll wager right here that: \\"John Barleycorn\\" will see it's next re-issue as a Deluxe 2 CD Set as was already done with the: \\"Blind Faith\\" album with more of the Filmore East tapes included. I've only been waiting 36 years to hear that one!l tune more modern than the versions that you are going to find as recorded by Fairport Convention and/or Jethro Tull.

It is a great little peak into the rock world of 1970 and this is indeed, quite a find!    I'll wager right here that: \\"John Barleycorn\\" will see it's next re-issue as a Deluxe 2 CD Set as was already done with the: \\"Blind Faith\\" album with more of the Filmore East tapes included. I've only been waiting 36 years to hear that one!
B000002IU9|5.0|Another great album that you must own from this remarkable band! This is just another classic piece of classic metal that will compliment your music collectio, and is sure to sonically assault your ears for years to come! So raise those hammer signs, and turn it up L-O-U-D!!!

B000V4UFZK|1.0|It's not just that this disc has no Special Features of any significance -- there ISN'T EVEN A TRAILER ON IT!!    Warner usually releases some of the best DVDs but this one is a crushing disappointment.    The movie is still great but what can you say about a release that doesn't offer anything of the way of note in terms of this 1982 classic's production?
B000TGJ8IU|1.0|Why would I want to see the director's cut to a movie that was, well, cliched and sweaty?  I suppose so I could hear the director's commentary on how long Brad Pitt spent oiling up his arms so they could shine in every scene?  Maybe so I can see the one character I thought three-dimensional die again.  Or maybe it's so I can see the gag reel which probably features the actors laughing at their own dialogue.  Either way, I'm not interested in the pre-production process that decided to dismiss the importance of the gods in this story, throw in contemporary dialogue, and (I thought this was impossible) parody ancient Greek art.  Seems like a waste of time.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Some disclosure, I do not like the way that Michael Moore makes his \\"documentaries\\" and I honestly do not feel they should be in that category. For he does make sure that everything is shown to support his preconceived idea. You know that once he starts he is going to be supporting his personal view. And that is seen in this film. I know how bad Cuba's health system is for the normal person and this film does not come close to showing it. We only get to see where the elite of Cuba go for healthcare. And we do not get to see those who wait trying to get specialist care in the \\"free\\" systems like France. It would be nice to see the good and bad of each system.<br /><br />Now with all that I have to say that even though his scenes are \\"cherry-picked\\", everything that Mr. Moore shows in his film about our Insurance system is quite accurate. In the richest country in the world with the best doctors and most advanced technology we have too many people going without required care. And his includes both medical procedures and prescriptions. I have seen a five year paperwork trail of someone insured by one of the largest health insurance companies in the U.S.A., with full health coverage, that was denied coverage for a piece of durable equipment that was required. This person could not wait for insurance so the equipment was purchased and claim filed, of course the claim was denied. After the five years of appeals, including involvement by his Senator and the U.S Department of Health, the piece of equipment was approved. But guess what? A letter was sent saying they, the insurance company, would not pay for the durable equipment bought because it was the \\"wrong\\" brand!<br /><br />Most of our medical practitioners and all prescription companies have no compassion. All that matters is the bottom line, greed. We may have very good quality medical care, if you can get it that is. Having insurance is only for those who really do not need it. And even if you do have great insurance, it does not mean you are covered at all. So obviously the United States is in need of healthcare reform. And I do hope that everyone sees this film with an open mind. I know it shows only extremes, but what someone should realize that in the United States, not one citizen should have to go without required prescriptions or medical care regardless of its cost. And no one should have to choose between his or her life and their home.<br /><br />We all know nothing is free, a free system would mean increase taxes. But let us see what those taxes would be and put it on a ballot so that the people can vote on the systems they want. The taxes might not be that much higher overall. Or perhaps the single payer system. No matter what anyone thinks of Michael Moore, hopefully this fill will increase the discourse on the U.S.A.'s healthcare system. This is the best film he has produced yet.mean you are covered at all. So obviously the United States is in need of healthcare reform. And I do hope that everyone sees this film with an open mind.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|It's hard to believe that over twenty years have passed since the Berlin Wall came down, and an era of totalitarianism and repression ended in what had been East Germany. While many have chosen to forget the era, there are lessons to be learned, and \\"The Lives of Others\\", Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's directorial debut, brilliantly recaptures the political climate, and emotional cost of life in a police state.<br /><br />Starring Ulrich M&uuml;he as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, a 'by-the-book' member of the Stassi (East Germany's equivalent of the SS or KGB), assigned to surveillance of the country's only 'loyal' playwright (Sebastian Koch), on the whim of a senior official enamored of his wife (the brilliant Martina Gedeck), the film echoes western films like \\"The Conversation\\" and \\"1984\\", as any privacy is lost, and all actions must be for \\"the good of the State\\". But, in eavesdropping, Wiesler begins to change, and appreciate the humanity of the couple, and insanity of a system that would reduce the woman into an unwilling prostitution, while attempting to destroy a guiltless man; indeed, the writer only becomes subversive after being driven to it, by the government, itself. Wiesler begins to 'cover' the writer's activities, and attempt to protect the couple's lives...with tragic consequences, for everyone involved.<br /><br />A difficult story to film, as much of East Berlin was destroyed and renovated when the Wall was torn down, the film is a remarkable testament to recent history, with an important lesson, that any system that enforces repression will ultimately collapse under it's own inability to serve everyone.<br /><br />\\"The Lives of Others\\" was an award-winner, world-wide, and is an unforgettable experience, not to be missed.
B00005JPRF|3.0|Here we have the third installment of Resident Evil. The survivors of the Raccoon City catastrophe travel across the Nevada desert, hoping to make it to a place of safety. Alice (Jovovich) joins the caravan and their fight against the ever-present Umbrella Corp and of course zombies. They are following a note that has them traveling to an infected free zone. After all this is a zombie movie with our heroine played Jovovich doing what she does best. Plenty of zombie fighting action is here and this time in the great outdoors in daylight. She seems able to be able to control hear mental powers a little better now as you would expect, but its use does affect her. Alice seems to be gaining more knowledge about what she is capable of; and I am sure more will be revealed in part four. I do not play the game, so I do not know if this is a progression from it or something the scriptwriters came up with. Oh, you noticed I said part four. Yes, this movie does not look it be the end of a trilogy; I expect another one will be on its way. Now if you are a big Resident evil fan or a fan of B-movies as I am, you will enjoy this. But I would just wait and buy the DVD.
B000GH3CVQ|4.0|There are still some great songs in here but some louder singing in a couple songs seem to break up and not mesh entirely well with what I would otherwise definitely call a beautiful hamonious work/effort. The strings and voices balance well in all the other songs that I would play during a nice dinner party (except during the louder couple of songs).
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Pixar and Disney have made a film that is truly visually appealing. In this movie we follow Remy the rat who has a unique nose for food. It is so sensitive that he can even detect when the food contains rat poison. His sense of smell leads him to a world of flavors and a love of great food. Though his family looks at any scraps as just energy to fuel the body, Remy has other ideas. So ignoring his father's advice he sets out to fulfill his dream of experiencing great food. Once he finds out he is actually living below Paris, he decides he must become a chef and fulfill his greater desire of creating great food. And it just so happens that he is living beneath the restaurant of his culinary hero, Augusted Gusteau. Remy quickly forms a bond with the garbage boy, Linguini. This leads to an adventure that has a story line that is worth watching. Like an old Disney movie we have a real storyline where we follow our little hero as he learns about what is important in life; family, friendship and striving to be the best you can at what ever you try. You also actually learn what it is like to work in a kitchen of a restaurant and the role that food critics play. This is a movie for those of all ages.

But when I heard Nantes (track two), I was pleasantly suprised. After listening to the album numerous times, purchasing it electronically, and then actually buying the physical album (Gasp!), all I can say is I can't wait for the next one to come out.

0061122416|5.0|This is an amazing surprisingly inspirational book that I have read many times before.

0618680004|1.0|Unfortunately, millions of us have had to suffer with how Richard Dawkins' pathetic ideas get propagated through society (as in the case of \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" which the white-collar criminal mastermind Jeff Skilling used to justify his ruthless ambitions as he helped a Fortune 500 firm become insolvent in the largest bankruptcy in world history, destroying the lives of thousands of people, and erasing billions of dollars in market capitalization). I can only wonder how many other equally greedy misanthropes are out there, now, devouring Dawkins' latest cynical monologue that condemns religiosity for the repeated pains it allegely has caused mankind. Ultimately, Dawkins does not have an answer, and all his arguments ultimately are philosophical tautologies (but thankfully, he restrains himself from again attacking the Bush administration, as he did in the plodding \\"Ancestors Tale\\"). Given that the Bush administration was the biggest beneficiary of Enron's political giving, let's hope that the \\"God Delusion\\" isn't inspiring another white-collar criminal in America to do evil.
014305841X|4.0|This is a well-written, detailed book about the sources of various agricutural products and foods in the USA.  The audiobook made it easier to get through some rather heavy and over-descriptive material.  But that is the beauty of Pollan's style.  I have certainly become more informed about mass (\\"industrial\\") food production in the USA.  Pollan has made me just a bit cynical about the \\"organic\\" foods avaialable on supermarket shelves.    If only a few politicians would read (or listen to) this book, we may see some meaningful changes to the US farm subsidy programs!
B0000AUHPB|3.0|I saw the 2003 remake of The Italian Job before I saw the 1969 version.  The chief difference between the films is that the first film is a comedy while the second is meant as an action-drama.  The first Italian Job is filled with a large number of gang members about whom we know nothing in the film concentrating on the main players - Michael Caine and Noel Coward.  With the 2003 version we get to know each team member and their specialty and a lot of the fun are the different likes/dislikes Charlie's team and how they interact with each other.  Benny Hill, as the computer expert, in the first Italian Job is more interested in fat women than turning traffic control in Turin upside down; his role has no real humor and is too small to be of any consequence.       Michael Caine makes a good Charlie but he is also not the brains behind the operation: Rossano Brazzi (who is done in by the Mafia at the opening) has planned the job and although the Mafia boss (played by Raf Valone) is threatening he is inconsequential during the heist when he could pop up as a surprise for Charlie and the gang.  The 2003 Italian Job keeps you on the edge until the very end. The chase in the 1969 film is good but it is hardly the thrilling ride in the 2003 film where Charlie and company are seriously challenged; the police in the first film are bumbling at best.     Sadly, I did not find much of interest in the first Italian Job and can only recommend the film for Michael Caine's performance.  The film is a bit slow in starting, a little vague about the characters and motives with a decent car chase.
B00080ZG10|4.0|The Aviator starring Leonardo DiCaprio is an exciting film about the life and loves of Howard Hughes, the film also focuses on his plane crash, his obsession with cleanliness, and his financial struggles. DiCaprio should've won the oscar for lead actor instead of that over-rated Jaime Foxx. This could easily be Leo's best performance to date. And don't forget about the luminous Cate Blanchett, she won the best supporting oscar for her dead-on portrayal of screen legend, Katherine Hepburn. Kate Beckinsale also does a fine job doing her best Eva Gardner. The only thing that's disappointing is the ending, there's no real closure and it's kind of a shame since the film runs about 3 hours. This is a great biopic nonetheless so save yourself a weekend and watch this film!
0800105877|4.0|Tony Richardson has not received ample praise for successfully transferring a Shakespeare play to cinema in this marvelous film. Watch how Olivier grapples with the problem in films such as Henry V and then see how simply Richardson dissolves the question of whether what we see is on a stage or is supposed to be in a real-world setting by filming the actors in closeup predominantly and keeping the setting genuinely \\"in the background\\"--and a shadowy one at that. It helps that he filmed Hamlet, of course, set in the moody castle at Elsinore. Williamson is, to me, unforgettable in the title role. Anthony Hopkins is the best Claudius I have seen; precisely the nasty sty Hamlet calls him, and the highlight of the film is Hamlet's doing him in at last. The rendering of the duel is truly exciting and cathartic, as it should be. Hooray! (Compare it to Branagh's ludicrous, pumped up version with the levitating rapier!) I love the rest of the cast also right down to the gravedigger, and I only give the film four instead of five stars because of the twist given to the Laertes-Ophelia farewell scene--an unfortunate move by the director to attract comment or attention. He need not have, given all the merits of this Hamlet.
B0006HB84Y|5.0|Every track is great. I looooove Mi Morena. It's such a beautiful song. You can feel the passion he feels through his singing. You must get the special edition! My other favorite song is Remember When It Rained where he plays piano and sings. So many great tracks, can't review all of them. He is one of the world's best singer and one of the most talented musician around. He just keeps getting better and better.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural season 2 improves on the first season in many significant ways. They combine drama, horror, humor (sometimes even romance) in an interesting mix each week.  Look for lots of iconic (and not so iconic) guest stars and the continuing struggle against the Yellow Eyed Demon, who is responsible for the death of Sam and Dean's mother.  This season is a must-buy for any Supernatural fan. Too bad they didn't decide to release this season in HD or Blu-Ray formats.
B0001WTUH6|3.0|Based on the White-Wolf Vampire the Masquerade universe, but without all the coolness of it. Werewolves look like cat-humans. Not the large scary half-crinos wolf men. It has good moments, cool gadgets and a sequel with better looking were-wolves.     The writer worked for WW and wrote a few books for them. She then quite and showed up with this movie and WW sued her pants off.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This movie is so well done. I have seen countless movies that didn't portray the book very well or not at all; but this movie is different. I read the book when I was in the seventh grade when I first read Jane Eyre. I won't lie, I hated the book. I thought it went on for to long. But when my sister brought home the movie I was intrigued. I sat down to watch the first ten minutes and ended up watching the whole thing. It is a refreshing take on such a well known classic. I am now in love with the movie and Mr. Rochester. And I'm sure that anyone else who sees it will be to.
6305308659|5.0|This is a delightful movie that shows bigotry in a different light.  During a movie marathon of Pleasantville, siblings are transported to this mythical town where everything is black and white, and a burning tree and the firemen have no clue as to how to put the fire out. But as the siblings eject a little bit of themselves into this pure storyline, color eases in to cause a panic and a division among the citizens of this small town.  Very well down and enjoyable.
0375701427|4.0|Until recently I have stayed away from Philip Roth and his well known alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman due to my perception of his writing as being  the typical east-coast intellectually superior ramblings of a middle aged baby boomer liberal.  Well, once again I have been proven an idiot.    First of all, after reading this absolutely wonderful novel (I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if that was possible) I have concluded that Mr Roth is intellectually superior, so he can write from that perspective if he wishes; but of course he never does.      The story here is complex, and Roth's dense writing style is magnetic.  I usually blow through books, but this novel merited a slower more contemplative reading.  So much is going on, the inner workings of the charecters and the 2nd and 3rd order effects of the actions taken by them is perfect in it's execution.  It's really a joy to read, brilliantly written.    I am now planning to purchase some of Roth's other works, this book has made me a fan.    BTW - in a previous unflaterring review of The Corrections by Nathan Frazan, I mentioned that I liked a well written tragedy, and to my point this is it.  A superior book, in all ways.
1577314808|2.0|I've read it more than once, to get his message and I agree that one can cleverly resolve vexing issues by simply being/stepping into the present. However, that is just a defensive tool to avoid depression and to turn on \\"happy apathy\\" when the going gets tough. Neat trick, but the \\"fluffy bunny\\" experience does not, in my opinion, guide one to spiritual enlightenment. It just guides one on how to selfishly step out of the icky game of life and irresponsibly leave the remaining writhing mass of humanity to their own discomforts. Slaves of sleep. Not logical Captain. Spiritual enlightenment would seem to be the creative taking of full responsibility for repairing the games of life so one never gets trapped again. Less tragic lessons. More wisdom in resolving life's little anxieties rather than ignoring them. Read Judge Thomas Troward for empowering creative enlightment.
B000O179A4|3.0|I though this movie was mostly entertaining. I thought the music was exceptional. I did think some of the songs went on for way too long, like the one where Jennifer Hudson's character was being removed from the band.     I thought this movie was probably pretty close to what it was like for an African American to get introduced into the music industry. I also thought the acting was suberb.     I lower the rating by one because of the unneccesary placement of the F word from Beyonce's character (I can't stand movies that put it in there to make sure they get a PG13 rating) and another point because it was probably about 30 minutes too long and some of the characters weren't developed as much as they should, like Eddie Murphy's and the Dreamgirl that he was sleeping with.     Overally good but not great.
B000WMVJ7E|4.0|I am happy to say that the new Wes Anderson film \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" is much better than his last film \\"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\\". But that is almost like damning the film with faint praise. It would be difficult for this film to be as bad as the director's last.<br /><br />That said, \\"Darjeeling\\" has some winning performances, some great humorous moments and seems to reintroduce us to the wacky sensibility that made us love the director in the first place. \\"Darjeeling\\" is not without it's problems, but it is a very funny and amusing film.<br /><br />Peter (Adrian Brody) runs to catch the Darjeeling Limited which is pulling out of a train station in a major Indian city. He soon joins his two brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). Francis planned this trip, with the help of his beleaguered assistant, Brendan (Wallace Wolodarsky, a former producer on \\"The Simpsons\\"), because they have not spoken in over a year. He misses their conversation, their sibling rivalry and their companionship. Francis has the entire trip planned, down to the religious ceremonies they will perform at various holy sights. But when the brothers start to act up, due to a variety of circumstances, including divergent personalities, over the counter medicines and a poisonous snake, the Chief Steward (Waris Ahluwalia) kicks them off the train in the middle of the dessert. Francis soon reveals his hidden agenda and they pull together to get through the trip and become brothers again.<br /><br />Each of Wes Anderson's films has a style unique to the filmmaker. Each of his films is populated by a collection of off-center people who live eccentric lives in an eccentric environment. Generally, his characters have money, either as a new circumstance or their bank accounts are dwindling, but they are still used to living a certain way. \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" is no exception. From the moment we meet Francis, we begin to learn he has a company of his own, and feels the need to show this off by bringing his assistant along on the trip. Brenda will drop off their schedule every morning, under the door of their compartment, before they even wake up. They brought along a computer and laminating machine to aid in this task. As Jack runs to catch the train, he is carrying a couple of pieces of odd luggage, luggage that would probably be more comfortable in the hands of a child, each piece appears to have dinosaur stickers plastered over it. As he enters the compartment he will share with his brothers, we see many other pieces of the same luggage, all of it an exact match down to the monogram. Anderson goes to a lot of trouble to design every aspect of the universe his characters will inhabit. From what I understand, he designed every aspect of the train cars we see in the film. This attention to detail shows, giving the main setting for a significant portion of the film a character; these train compartments are interesting and unique, they appear like something we would expect to find in India, but are so gaudy and over decorated, like a British Lord initially commissioned them. Now independent, the Indians seem determined to uphold the tradition of the train cars while injecting their own indigenous traditions to the interior.<br /><br />Each of the three leads is good and adds significantly to the overall quirky nature of the film. Owen Wilson, who has been the focus of a number of tabloid stories lately, plays Francis, the more domineering brother. At dinner, he orders food for his brothers. And he is also the force behind the trip and their itinerary. He set-up the trip because he realized the three brothers were not communicating anymore and needed some bonding time.<br /><br />As the more domineering, fussy member of the family, Wilson's Francis is the least funny of the three. It doesn't help that Wilson's slow drawl sort of lends a whiny quality to his character. But he is still good. When the brothers get together, they slowly start to devolve into the children they once were and Francis finds his role, mother hen.<br /><br />Adrian Brody's Peter is an interesting guy. He agrees to go on the trip because he is having some trouble with his girlfriend back home and wants to escape for a while. A grown man, he is unable to hide his former self when he gets together with his brothers; Francis decides Peter should have the top bunk, his long legs dangling over the side and the gangly brother is chugging some over the counter Indian pain medicine, which his siblings begin to share. But Peter seems to recognize the need for the bonding time and goes along with his brother's overbearing plans.<br /><br />I have never been a huge fan of Jason Schwartzman, but he is also good as Jack, clearly the youngest brother. There are some references to his life as a successful writer, living in Paris, trying to get over his ex-girlfriend. Jack carries around a short story he just competed and eagerly seeks the approval of his other brothers.<br /><br />From the moment they board the train, Jack is smitten with Rita (Amara Karan), an employee on the train, a sort of stewardess who makes sure the guests have enough refreshments. She recognizes the look in Jack's eyes as he continues to pursue her.<br /><br />Anjelica Huston pops up in a small role as Patricia, a nun living in a small monastery at the foot of the Himalayas. Patricia once played a role in the lives of the three men and their visit with her is cathartic.<br /><br />As much as there is to love about \\"Darjeeling\\", it makes a similar mistake to \\"The Life Aquatic\\", a mistake that derails the Bill Murray film. Thankfully, the events in \\"Darjeeling\\" only prove to provide an odd side trip in their journey. A confusing side trip at that; the events really seem to have no connection to the brothers or their journey. I think the key difference here is \\"Life Aquatic\\" ends with this event, leaving us with this as our final memory. In \\"Darjeeling\\", the similar event happens earlier, giving us some story to help us forget the problematic part of the story.<br /><br />\\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" is a quirky, fun, funny look at three brothers on a road trip.

B00005JPQP|3.0|Both Oceans 11 and 12 were fantastic and i loved them both. I expected the world from 13, but was let down. I am a HUGE fan of Eddie Izzard (from his stand up comedy and Oceans 12), however, in 13 he had the most bizarre presence. He was not even put to good use as an artist. His absence wouldnt have been noticed at all! Wasted talent. He shows up walks around, swears, thats it! Come on Steven you could have done better. It was like he was the token Brit in the movie. He is a brilliant actor, and yet you utilised his talent minimally, sad. Anyway since i have 11 and 12 i will buy 13 to complete the trilogy. But i believe as a viewer I deserve a fourth part of high calibre and humour(something missing in part 3). One and two had so much pizzaz and panache, this was a massive let down. One more to make up,what you say you,cast????
0143038583|5.0|Not to beat a dead review horse, but this is one of the best I've read this year.  He provides a new and unique perspective on our food sources, with his welcomed style of detail: everything you've wanted to know about corn and cows (similar to the Botany of Desire's everything you've wanted to know about apples).  A totally enjoyable read!
B000JLTRJ0|2.0|The film overall lacked ingenuity. People can say \\"oh how can you say that about what happened.\\" IM NOT. I'm saying THE MOVIE Sucked. Sorry for the street word, but that is exactly how to describe it. Right from the beginning when the cops were being hauled from PA to downtown, there was no emotional creativity. The cut scenes were paltry and boring. SHOW THE TERROR Stone, don't candy coat it all mamsy-pamsey for the masses. What a sell out. Pathetic. A cut scene with a guy with a little soot on his double breast or another with a bleeding ear is really not well done. Let's see the horror. It was dull, boring and I don't know how The Academy or anyone rational can think Nick Cage is anything less than wooden and plastic in every Role he is in. He lacks any emotional creativity in all forms. It was not the Oliver Stone I expected and admired from Wall Street and Platoon. United 93 blew this film away in every aspect. In every way. WTC was Hollywood from jumpstreet. It was like a pre packaged deal at Walmart this film. What a total piece of garbage. I understand he is showing it from a different aspect entirely, but one wonders why it bombed in the box office and you can often get it here for 67 cents. There is a reason. It was awful, and it could have been phenomenal. What a shame.

B000001E18|5.0|IF YOU LIKE U2'S JANGLE ROCK OF THE 2000'S YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS CD.    Released in 1993, this was U2's seventh pure studio album and the band's nineth album overall.  It is 50 minutes long and the sound quality is excellent.    In my opinion, U2's odd numbered albums are the best....Boy, War, Joshua Tree and Zooropa, before they went soft and mushy in 2000 with It's A Beautiful Day.    After the Rattle and Hum mess (it had some great songs, but was all over the place), U2 went a new direction with Achtung Baby, which included some experimentation.  I don't think it went far enough, and though it had some great songs, there were many others that were just mediocre.  With Zooropa, U2 carried along the same path, but took it farther.  The result is a very interesting and engaging album.  There is a lot of variety and nothing is boring.  Although there is some mixture of styles, it isn't a jumbled mess like Rattle and Hum.    Zooropa was a prelude to Pop, which used some of the themes and overdid them (although it is still a good album).  Pop was supposed to be the next big thing in music.  After it failed to generate a new trend, U2 ended up conforming the to Jangle Pop sound of the 2000's with the next two albums.  Instead of being innovators like on Zooropa, they have become followers.

I purchased Shane from Amazon on DVD.  Wonderful movie for the whole family. Watching Joey eat that candy cane while Shane kicked butt was so funny.
0743486285|5.0|I bought this book because I have always been a fan and because I was a low bottom addict myself (recovering from Crack for 12 years now).  I was absolutely blown away with Nikki's level of honesty.  It showed me that you don't have to be homeless to truly suffer as an addict.  The feelings he went through were identical to my own feelings while the surroundings were totally different.  Absolutely amazing book!
B00006DEF9|5.0|What a classic and fun movie this is. Our whole family enjoys watching the great singing and dancing of all the stars. Of course Gene Kelly's wonderful performance of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" makes the whole movie. It always brings a smile to my face and lifts my heart.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|Fantasy is hard to find in the movies -- for every \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" there's only a handful of bad sword'n'sorcery tales for kids (\\"Eragon,\\" \\"The Seeker\\"). As for fairy tales, forget it.<br /><br />But one little fairy tale HAS made its way into theatres -- an enchanting little story loosely based on a Neil Gaiman novel. And \\"Stardust's\\" charm is its lack of pretension, and its willingness to be silly, romantic, fantastical, sparkling and most importantly, tongue-in-cheek. And it has pirates too.<br /><br />A wall separates our world from the world of magic -- and one night, Dunstan Thorn went over it, and had a brief tryst with a beautiful princess, who is imprisoned by a witch. Nine months later, baby Tristan is left on his doorstep.<br /><br />Nineteen years later, a dying king magically flings a ruby into the sky, and says that the prince who finds it will be the new king. The two remaining princes -- and the ghosts of their dead brothers -- et off to find it. But that ruby dislodged a star, and it plummets to the ground across the Wall -- attracting the attention of three ancient witches, who use the hearts of stars to restore their spent youth.<br /><br />Still with me?<br /><br />Tristan (Charlie Cox) also sees the star, and the snotty girl he adores (Sienna Miller) says that she will marry him if he gets her the star before her birthday. Tristan does manage to find and entrap the beautiful star, Yvaine (Claire Danes), and they start off on a magical adventure of air pirates, unicorns, evil witches, and true love.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" has pretty much all the requirements for a fantasy and/or fairy tale movie -- magic, love, an evil villain, and lots of odd characters to round out the cast, and flesh out the story. Not much is actually new. But like the original Gaiman tale, the movie winks affectionately at you as the story unfolds.<br /><br />In fact, the movie only really stumbles when it stops to ruminate on true love and how precious it is, etc. Cute, but boring -- especially since the romantic leanings of the leads are pretty clear. Director Matthew Vaughn really shines when he's focusing on airships, goat-men, and the occasional magical sword-fight with an dead man.<br /><br />Despite the scattered nature of the plot, Vaughn directs with a smooth, sure hand, and he sprinkles plenty of comic relief through it -- Captain Shakespeare dancing in drag, or the Greek chorus of murdered princes. And the dialogue avoids fantastical pomposity by being just as tongue-in-cheek (\\"Nothing says \\"romance\\" like a kidnapped injured woman!\\")<br /><br />Cox makes an excellent wide-eyed, slightly blinkered country boy, who turns from a bumbling suitor to a strong young hero. Danes isn't quite as ethereal as one would expect Yvain to be, but she gives a solid performance, and Miller is perfect as the snotty, shallow Victoria.<br /><br />But while the younger performers are solid, the veterans are absolutely brilliant. Pfeiffer is hilarious, chilling and pouty as the constantly frustrated witch, and De Niro steals the show as a cuddly, twinkly-eyed gay pirate who pretends to be brutal. And Peter O'Toole and David Kelly have brief but brilliant appearances.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is exactly what the title suggests -- sparkling, funny, wry, and just deep enough to be entertaining.

B000SNUMC0|5.0|This disc is freakin' awesome. I grudgingly removed it from my cd player after a week. I'll most definitely be buying Part 2 when it comes out. Ripper Owens has quickly become one of my favorite vocalists. Jon's riffs are outstanding as always. This is the best disc I've heard all year.
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|A film that people like or dislke, I found this movie very entertaining dispite some flaws-production/storyline- that has been pointed out by prior reviews. The blu ray transfer was more than adequete. And, unlike many blu ray releases has all the extras that were included in the 2 disc standard version.
B000784WMW|5.0|I had purchased the VHS movies which was cut from the series in the early 1990's and enjoyed the preformance of the actors.  This DVD is the whole series from BBC and is outstanding.  If you enjoy the Jane Eyre clssic story, this is a must have for your collection.
0805079831|5.0|This is a MUST READ for anyone interested in the future of democracy, such as it is in its badly withered present state. The writing is very well researched and footnoted. After reading only a part of it, I drove up to Santa Barbara to catch Naomi at the end of her book tour. In person, she is riveting. And, I bought another book there that she signed.     I have to say that the book I got early from Amazon was damaged...it had little tears on the top of several of the middle pages. I was planning to return it for credit, but ended up lending it out to a friend instead. I'm not sure I'll be buying again from Amazon because of this. Sending back is too much of a hassle.///
B000PFU7OO|5.0|When I saw the movie, I was so moved my the music and I am glad to say the same emotions come back when I listen to the CD -- the voices are full of emotion and talent, and it is just plain fun to listen to. I highly recommend it -- and if you haven't yet, see the movie! it is wondeful!
B00005JPGO|2.0|Hollywood takes an acceptable story,lengthens it,brutalizes it, convolutes it,then apparently asks DiCaprio to save the film for the viewing audience.Leo does his best with some realistic,mature acting, but this is not a movie that can be dominated by one man( a la Jason Bourne).If you're a DiCaprio fan, you'll probably enjoy his acting. Otherwise,this production is little more than a dud.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie had more testosterone than Sparticus and Ben Hur combined people. Oh I've never seen so many specimens of manhood bound up in one movie. I like to sit and watch this movie in my Spartan costume and prance around the house like Caligula!!! During the battle scenes I enjoy pulling on my nipple rings and bending myself over the coffee table for a spanking. My biggest complaint is that in this movie they did not show the Spartans engaging in homosexual sex with each other. They did that you know. That;s why they were such fierce warriors. On the battlefield they protected not only their brothers and fellow warriors, but their lovers.<br /><br />Still this movie is just a tad bit far fetched. I did not know that Xerxes had monsters fighting for him. Nor did I realize he had a mutant executioner. Xerxes was a fine fine girly man. His piercings made my knees weak.<br /><br />Still I wonder why this whole movie was shot on a green screen. It just made the movie seem that much more fake when you add the fact they also had a giant killer rhinoserus, and characters that looked like they came out of Mortal Kombat. This movie ended up looking more and more like a video game. In fact I'm curious now to see how long it will take XBOX to release a 300 game. But I did like the fact that it was narrated in much the same manner as Conan the Barbarian with Arnold.<br /><br />Throw in some more scenes with tight manly buttocks to go along with those abs next time. But this movie has enough man meat in it to get me hot.
B000063DI9|5.0|Ever since I heard the Powerslave album I was addicted to Maiden. I wanted to sing just like Bruce. Their sound is crazy, catchy, upbeat. I have become a fan and I own 8 of their 14 albums.<br /><br />I FINALLY got around to getting Seventh Son of a Seventh Son on Tuesday, and It's my new favorite album. This album is flawless from finish to start! Great progressive feel to it, and a little Punk-metal vibe to it, like Powerslave, except better. I just can't get enough!<br /><br />Moonchild starts off the album with a creepy acoustic intro with Bruce singing a poem: \\"Seven Deadly Sins, Seven ways To Win, Seven Holy Paths To Hell and your dream begins. Seven Downward slopes, Seven bloody hopes, seven are your burning fires, Seven: Your desires...\\" then we get into a kickass synth intro. I wish I could play like that. After that, we get into a cool speed-metal song. It's kickass enough to have you singing \\"MOONCHILD!!!!!!\\" the whole day.<br /><br />My Favorite track off the album is the title track. It begins very epic, and is based on the book \\"Seventh Son\\". I like Bruce's spoken-word part in the middle.<br /><br />Only The Good Die Young is a good closer too, and I like how it closes with the \\"Seven _______\\" part from the Moonchild intro.<br /><br />OTHER SONGS I LOVE:<br />The Prophecy<br />Can I Play With Madness?<br />Infinite Dreams<br />The Clairvoyant<br /><br />This is an awesome CD, as any rock fan should have it. It's the best album I've ever heard, and Anyone should have it!!!!
B000002LEM|4.0|Let's get one thing straight Van Hagar was not about changing the world or ending poverty...they were about having fun, and they were not about copying their old DLR flavoured self. Van Hagar started almost as a new band, their sound and songs being the fruit of a different *new* tree.<br />I like a few of DLR's VH songs, and I don't question DLR's style and don't discard it, I just happen to enjoy Van Hagar's style so much more than anything DLR Halen did (Except probably \\"unchained\\" and \\"can't get this stuff no more\\" both totally awesome)<br />That being said, let's talk about OU812.<br />Out of Van Hagar's repertoire this is the album I like the least, (Not saying it is the worst or a bad album I just happen to like the other 3 better) not meaning that is album doesn't have a full set or great songs.<br />Mine all mine: Not my fav, lyrics are OK but the music kinda sounds weird (unfinished?) 7/10<br />When it's love: Yeap it's kinda sappy, yes it sounds like a why can't this be love version o cousin, but the song, perhaps excluding the chorus, is one of VH's best balads, lyrics are great. The keyboard intro really gives me goose bumps as well as the whole lyrics and solo around the middle of the song 8.5/10<br />AFU (All fired up): Not the best IMO, good display of EVH's speed... 6/10<br />Cabo wabo: Who knows maybe Sammy had just discovered cabo when he wrote the song and he just got into it and wrote about it... who cares if it is a commercial ?! (Though we all know it is not) The whole song is great, it almost makes you feel you're there with the boys, having tequila in the white sands, great chorus and solo around the middle of the song (again) one of the top 3 of this album. 9/10<br />Source of infection: Another speedy show case of EDV's skills, this one feels like the whole band is just jamming and having fun, but it ends up feeling like filler. 5/10<br />Feels so good: Comes up sounding not very VH, but it is still a good pop song, a bit on the sappy side again but not a bad song at all. 7/10<br />Finish what ya started: Boy, a VH masterpiece hands down ! Eddy just tears down paradigms and showcases his ability with a very different style of what we have come to expect from him. Lyrics, tongue in cheek maybe but that is part of what makes this song, and it is a masterpiece, the kind of song DLR could have never pulled off. 10/10<br />Black and blue: Wow, what a 1-2 combination, black and blue and Finish what ya started make up the hight of the album... once again sexually driven, tongue in cheek but awesome as a whole, comes in great after the previous song. 9.5/10<br />Sucker in a 3 piece: Very underrated song, not one of the best but solid and awesome solo. 8/10<br />A apocalyptical blues: Kills the album, the same way \\"The wanderer\\" killed U2's zooropa album at the end, but not as bad. After years of listening the whole album without skipping a single second of this album it came in as a natural closer for it (An acquired take for certain)  5/10<br /><br />Overall 75% = 3.75 stars<br />The best 3 songs are enough reason to pay for it if you ask me, but once again, this album trailed behind all of the other Van Hagar albums.10  Finish what ya started: Boy, a VH masterpiece hands down !

B000ETQPYM|1.0|I have recently dicovered the whimsy and fun of chick lit. However, I found this bit of chick-lit to be very pedestrian and drab. A common girl, newly widowed, who wallows in her pity party. While some of her reflections on her loss are downright beautiful and worthy of a hanky, the premise of this book could have done without the very naive, meandering, and sloppy writing style. I would like to see how this authoress might actually tell this same tale when she's 40. Ripe with sitcom, easy, shallow laughs, the young women portrayed in this book lack any ounce sophistication. While the idea of this piece is intriquing (her husband leaving her monthly notes after his passing that assist her with moving forward in her life without him) and clever, I found the characters to be boring and very common. Doubtful I will read anything by Ahern again even for escapist fun.
0316067598|1.0|Special Forces soldiers are the most heroic and respected men in all military branches. It is always a privelige to read about combat missions they partake in to protect our country  I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with this book. I felt like I was reading a Ann Coulter book rather than a seal team fighting terrorists in Afghanistan. I wish I could say that I read the whole book, but I was so fed up with the political ranting by chapter two, that I decided to throw the book in the trash.  I wish the author left out his political beliefs because it took away from the heroic story of his seal team. Maybe the publishing company should reprint the book without these tirades, for I am sure it is a great story that needs to be told
1401300529|5.0|This volume typifies the care with which the author develops his books.  The start is the surprise appearance of Chinese troop at Unsam in October of 1950.  Their vast numbers and surprise attack shredded American forces, which had advanced by then deep into North Korea.  The discussion of the fighting is classic Halberstam, with a lot of veterans reporting their experiences here, with great detail to provide a sense of the confusion and chaos as the Chinese attacked.  And, amazingly, General Douglas MacArthur proceeded as if all was well as the Chinese melted back into North Korea after the attack, no longer to be seen.  The continuing march to the Yalu River, of course, was to have dire consequences for the American and Allied forces.<br /><br />The book then examines the context for the outbreak of the Korean War, with a look at key actors--from MacArthur (no longer, apparently, at the top of his game), Mao Zedong, Kim Il Sung (the leader of North Korea), Syngman Rhee (the South Korean leader), Harry Truman, to Joseph Stalin.  Many other characters are portrayed as well, such as Dean Acheson and George Kennan and Chiang Kai-shek.  The depiction of these characters in the unfolding drama provides context, as does placement of Korea in the historical context of repression under the Japanese for much of the first half of the 20th century.<br /><br />One example: the detailed discussion of Douglas MacArthur is not very flattering.  But the description of his relationship with his father (a Civil War hero) and mother (a \\"stage mother\\" to her son's military career) and his need to always be right and to have control helps understand some of the decisions made early in the war.  Many will doubtless be upset about this portrayal of the General, but it is one of those detailed descriptions for which Halberstanm is well known.<br /><br />Then, the actual invasion of the South by the North in June, 1950 is laid out.  The discussion includes the dawning realization in Japan (MacArthur's HQ) and Washington D. C. of what is happening \\"on the ground\\" and their military and political response.  In great detail, the book considers the battlefield picture, including the surprise and effective counterattack by MacArthur's forces at Inchon, the rolling up of the North Koreans, and--then--the emergence of Chinese troops to turn the picture around once more--and finally, to the deadly stalemate near the line from which the war had begun.<br /><br />Some of the more valuable aspects of the volume are the interviews by the author with surviving veterans.  These data provide invaluable richness to the text and make the nature of the fighting come alive for the reader.<br /><br />In short, another epic work from David Halberstam.  He died shortly after completing the book in a car crash, so this represents his last major work.  It represents the author still at the peak of his powers.  A book well worth attending to.ashington D. C. of what is happening \\"on the ground\\" and their military and political response.

B000V8I2QU|3.0|I am a very long time Bruce Springsteen fan and enjoy most everything Bruce puts on the table for us to enjoy.  I bought this cd the day it came out.  I'm enjoying the music, although the recording quality sounds pretty flat on my high quality audio system.  Then there is the package - pure garbage.  I had to return the first cd since it was scratched and skipped on track 5.  I expect the scratch occurred getting the cd into the package at the factory - or out of the package with my fingers.  Here's a message to Columbia/Sony - if you want to sell cd's - give us quality recordings of interesting music in quality packaging designed to protect the cd.  This release is only 1 out of 3 at best.  It's a shame to see Bruce's musical offerings recorded poorly - and packaged pitifully.  I would not recommend this release to anyone who cares about quality.
B000VNMMRA|2.0|Live Free or Die Hard  aka Die Hard 4  2007    This movie is simply the WORST of the series. I'll go one further, it should've never been made. His mighty Willisness baffles me as to why he took such a poor script.    Ah yes, the script - lets start there.  Based on a book that focused on cyberterrorism isn't the ideal setting for John McClane. Oh ya, the book didn't even include Detective McClane. So, we have McClane being dropped into a pre-existing story and PRESTO - Die Hard movie! Thats strike one against this turkey.    Strike Two is that this dog has none of the charm, humility or tension of any of the Die Hard movies. Part of what we love about McClane is his good guy in whacked out scenarios. We can relate to him because he's a common \\"flatfoot\\" stuck in the insanity rising to do heroic things to beat the bad guys. Do we get that in this movie? Sort of, but not really. What we get is forced and doesn't work. There is little to no breathing room for McClane to be McClane. All the charm his character has shown over 3 films evaporates here.    Lastly, the storyline stinks. All the Die Hard movies bolt you in and take you for a wild ride. Yes, even Die Hard II with its hard to buy premise does this to. Die Hard IV just never quite connects to you and draws you in. That is a testament to the poor screenwriting and story pacing. It just doesn't work.    I know there is a lovefest in these reviews for this movie. I either think its the studio still puffing this dog up with its minions stuffing the reviews or its people thinking that its great because it has \\"Die Hard\\" in the title.    The facts: It doesn't stack up to ANY of the Die Hard films. Its a wooden  clunky pre-written script that minimizes the humanity of John McClane and doesn't offer any of the thrills or connection to the audience of its predecessors.    Die Hard 2 is now no longer the worst Die Hard movie.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|One word: AMAZING!. Waiting 3 years for this new release was worth it. Once again the band has blown my socks off. Mark Tremonti's riff's and solos explode off of his guitar like millions of electric bumblebees! He is by far the best guitarist of this decade. No one else comes close. Scott's drums and and Brian's bass pump out hard driving rythums that have me pounding my steering wheel like a crazed zulu warrior banging his war drums. These guys once again have proven the best part of Creed was the musicians, and by adding Myles Kennedy, who is not only a better singer than that guy with LSD (lead singers disease), but also a musician himself, this band should be rocking for a long long time. I saw them here in Dallas in '04 live, and have tickets to see them again in a few week's I cannot wait! Buy this CD NOW!!!!!!! You will be glad you did.
B00008VGL6|5.0|Brief summation: This album is a fantastic showcase of Mr. Gore's vocal, musical, and arranging abilities, accessible to most audiences (specifically, those with any penchant towards synth/electronic music).  Do not expect to see any Martin Gore songwriting here!<br /><br />First of all, I am a huge Depeche Mode fan (the band that allowed Mr. Gore to attain the majority of his fame) and have done no small amount of research on the band and its members.  The first thing you have to know about this album is that Martin DID NOT write any songs, so please do not expect an album of Gore originals!  This is an album of other artist's material - cover songs, if you will.  The reason, you may ask?  Mr. Gore himself has admitted that he's not a very prolific songwriter, and he prefers to keep his original songwriting for Depeche Mode.  Nothing wrong with that, and we Depeche fans will always appreciate his songwriting work.  You may note that his choice of songs for this album very closely parallels the same themes that Mr. Gore himself uses in his own songwriting.<br /><br />What this album will do is showcase Mr. Gore's incredible singing, musical, and arranging talents.  His voice is at turns a tender whisper and a passionate growl on this album, portraying the tenderest love, deepest depression, and the hungriest lust.  His vocal range is showcased considerably well with these songs, as well.  One may notice his incredible ability with harmonies with a number of tracks.<br /><br />Another important thing to keep in mind: Martin's penchant for synth-pop, electronica, or however you want to classify it, is definitely obvious in the arrangements.  However, that's Martin, and that's the musical course he's chosen for himself.  If you're not a big fan of synth-based music, you may not like this album.  Although an astute listener can tell that by the choices of music Mr. Gore has made, many of his musical influences are much older and more varied than simple \\"synth-pop\\" might lead you to assume.  The arrangements range from simple to complex, spare to lush, all very appropriate to the song, but all share the synth/electronic thread.  I firmly believe that this album is quite accessible, even if you're not a Depeche Mode fan.  I personally greatly enjoyed the electronic bent that Mr. Gore has lent to this wonderful collection of songs, and feel that the arrangements are excellent, on par with anything Depeche Mode has released.<br /><br />Overall, I hope you will keep an open mind and allow yourself to be drawn into the wonderful, and powerful world that Mr. Gore has created with this album!The arrangements range from simple to complex, spare to lush, all very appropriate to the song, but all share the synth/electronic thread.

B000002GQL|5.0|When I saw that the Moody Blues albums of the '60s and '70s were reissued on CDs, I immediately bought Seventh Sojourn and To Our Children's Children's Children.  They were my two favorites of the eight albums this group cranked out.  For me this is the Moody's best.  It has no bad cuts and some of the Moody's best songs.  The standouts are Ray Thomas' beautiful \\"For My Lady,\\" John Lodge's powerful love song \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" and Justin Hayward's \\"You and Me\\" with its great guitar work on the intro and finale.  The album ends with a rare Moody's rocker with \\"I'm Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band).\\"  These songs just bring back the '70s for me.
B000002OMN|5.0|I've been a Jim Steinman fan since the 1977 release of Bat Out of Hell, the year I graduated from high school. His operatic songs always catch my ear regardless of whose voice is driving the lyrics. Bonnie Tyler's \\"Holding Out for a Hero\\" and Streets of Fire soundtrack's \\"Tonight is What it Means to be Young\\" are clearly cousins and are personal favorites. Meat Loaf is still the definitive voice for a Jim Steinman song.     Despite my passion for Steinman, Meat Loaf and several individual songs from Bat II, I only recently listened to the entire album, front-to-back, for the first time. It was a long road trip. It was a perfect autumn day, alone in the car. It was a teenage reprise. It was like the perfect freedom of a newly licensed driver with solo control over the radio. The music took me back to the intense emotions of a teenager experiencing everything so deeply you're sure others can't feel emotions the same way or else how could anyone survive to old age.     Songs I love individually, \\"I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\\" still ring in my head, but this is really an album. The songs work as a single piece in a way few artists manage. If you let the music carry you it is a rollercoaster ride of emotions.     \\"Objects in the Rear View Mirror\\" epitomizes the album for me. Listening to Bat II, my teenage self is suddenly much closer than the thirty years distance would suggest. These truly are golden nuggets. Why Steinman works for me and not for others I can't explain. All I know is this music delivers pounding joy and real tears. I can't resist singing along. The lyrics stay in my head for days. The harmonies are great. The lyrics repeat but the music shifts intensity, themes and tempos. There is both complexity and subtlety in the music and lyrics. While the words repeat it is not truly repetitive. The music is orchestral in length and structure. There is humor and pathos, both of the teenage wasted youthvariety and of the lost youth (mature) variety.     Only a handful of albums are so fully engaging for me. This is another Steinman masterpiece.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|I had mp3 versions of all the songs from this album, and every time I listened to them I couldn't help but think of poor sound quality, poor recording, poor production. I listened \\"Magic\\" mp3's on my Sony Walkman while walking through town and, although the songs themself were great, I couldn't escape thoughts of afforementioned sound issues.<br />Yesterday I got my copy from Amazon (7 days before the estimated time of delivery, congratulations Amazon for extraordinary service), put the CD in my computer, and listened to it on Altec-Lansing speakers. Right from the start I was blown away by the sound. Crisp, powerful, deep, simply great sound. Like the songs are completely different than those I listened in weeks before yesterday. You simply can't judge sound produced by iPod or Walkman speakers with that of real, powerful speakers. I wanted to turn it up real loud, but it was 10PM and the neighbours would be very upset. Nevertheless, even not so loud, the sound was fantastic. After last night I cannot relate to anyone here complaining about that issue. Just listen to CD properly, on proper equipment. For instance, the title song sounds completely different, with plethora of instruments I couldn't even recognize on 192kbps mp3 rip, and Bruce's voice, instead of sounding old and worn out like in mp3 rip, now sounded crisp and miraculously rejuvenated. The same goes for \\"I'll work for your love\\", the song that sounded muffled and murky as mp3, and which I skipped almost every time because of that. But CD sound on real speakers turns it into a beautiful song which sound I enjoyed immensely.<br />As for the songs themselves, I need not say much, because they are tremendous. I pitty all the people complaining about lack of themes from earlier records - why would someone in his late 50's even consider singing about running his dreams in a car on some endless highway? Instead, what we got here is a collection of great songs that gets better and better with each listen, and that addresses so many issues that should be of importance for any grown up individual living in these times. I'm from Serbia, and every politicaly related song from \\"Magic\\" speaks of our current situation perfectly. To those who worship war, let them have Toby Keith. But to give this fantastic album 1 star because of its depth and insight is a sign of cognitive disorder of enormous magnitude.<br />Cudos to artist that continues to grow with each subsequent record, naturally continuing the patterns he established with his early work. It is unimaginable to me that Bruce Springsteen, after all the records he made, all the stories he told, and the attitude of integrity and pride of being human despite everything life has to put against his songs' characters that evolved in a world of such strong decency almost untouchable by other songwriters, that Bruce Springsteen would come anywhere else than where he is right now - a man whose standpoint is firm nad brave, whose observations are accurate, and whose music continue to astonish.<br /><br />When I was in highschool, every morning before going to school I would listen \\"Born in the USA\\" or \\"Tunnel of Love\\", I just couldn't imagine the morning without listening to Bruce. Until now, I never had that need to listen to anything. But these weeks I'm listening \\"Magic\\" every morning while walking to work, and each time I feel great, like I am going to highschool again. The songs are different, their themes are more complex as is the world of today, but that joy of great music is exactly the same.<br /><br />Strongest recommendations.addresses so many issues that should be of importance for any grown up individual living in these times.

0143038583|4.0|The first \\"meal\\" of this book will change how you think about food. I've never realized just how much our food supply is affected by not just politics, but wars, global markets, historic events, science, etc. I've also never realized how much corn I was eating.<br /><br />I have two faults with this book. One, it's a little too dense and sometimes boring to read, especially the middle two meals. Two, it provides no great answer to our industrial agriculture problem. The book tells you, in great detail, what's wrong, but it fails to really guide you in how to eat right. In the end, when Pollan hunts and gathers his own meal, it sounds largely idealistic. But Pollan isn't shy to point out that our numbers can no longer support a hunting and gathering society. Therefore, our most natural and healthy food supply is really unavailable.<br /><br />However, his book has helped me to at least make some better choices when I go to the supermarket. I'm no longer so easily swayed by \\"cage free\\" or \\"organic\\" as I used to be, and I'm more careful to choose the most local, cruelty-free option I can find.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, you'll come away from reading this book much smarter about what you eat and where it comes from.

B000IAZ6W4|5.0|Patrick Watson is a Montreal based musician and \\"Closer to Paradise\\" is his first United States CD release. \\"Closer to Paradise\\" is a cycle of songs, in which each song stands on the strength of Watson's mastery of the songwriting craft. The songs have the intrinsic quality of a hauntingly beautiful cinema soundtrack. Watson's greatest strength is the gift of his soaring voice which is capable of running the multi-octave range from contralto to purest sound of a soprano using a falsetto voice.<br /><br />Few male singers can hit the notes within mid-soprano range without  mimicking the notes with use of a falsetto. Falsetto translated from Italian literally means \\"false voice\\". All of my digression is to a point. While technically Patrick Watson sings falsetto his mimicry of the pure soprano is very convincing. It puts in the rarest company of few other vocal prodigies like Tim Buckley, his son Jeff Buckley and Martin Sexton all have fooled even the best tuned ears of the experts.<br /><br />The song arrangements have elements of the lush sound of baroque pop and the understated minimalism of ambient electronica. The four piece band behind Watson,like Jeff Buckley's former band mates are more than window dressing for his talents but an integral part of Patrick Watson's unique musical vision. Patrick Watson is the hands-down best debut album of 2007 and \\"Closer to Paradise\\" is but the opening chapter in a long musical journey.

B0000004V2|2.0|I bought this when it originally came out on vinyl. I'm a big fan of catchy pop music and heard good things about it. I'm really baffled that people are giving this such great reviews. I tried listening to it many times and it just never got my attention. Once, I put it on and about 10 minutes later I found myself thinking, \\"I should put some music on.\\" I forgot that it was on. Well, okay, the Thai Stick might have had something to do with it; but you know what I mean.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|I know that most people think that the second season of Veronica Mars is not as good as the first, but I found myself enjoying it more. If the over-arching storyline is not as compelling, the stand alone episodes definitely are. But even saying this, if you had to make me choose which season long arc was better, I wouldn't be able to choose. Season 2 definitely delivered on the lofty heights that Veronica Mars season 1 set.    During season 2 there are some fantastic episodes, probably my personal favourite being the final episode 'Not Pictured', which feels like the very thing the entire first 2 seasons were building towards. This is truly compelling television.    As far as the DVD set goes, this delivers about what you'd expect. While it doesnt go all out on the extras, what is there is quality. I would have liked to have seen some commentaries but I'm a commentary fan, and some do not share this sentiment. The extras features include deleted scenes, bloopers, a video diary on the set for a day with Kristen Bell and a documentary. All well worth it. Also, for those who care, the box art is superior to season 1 in my opinion.    Note: Buffy fans. If you want to see your lord and master, Joss Whedon ranting about minstrils, check out the bloopers. It's hilarious.    Overall a fantastic season of a great show and a great DVD package for it. Highly reccommended.

1594489505|5.0|I just finished A Thousand Splendid Suns, and I'm still blotting the tears from my eyes. I don't want to give away too much of the story, because I hate it when people do that in their reviews, so I'll try to be careful about what I write...    This is an incredibly heart wrenching tale of two Afghan women brought together by horrible circumstances, and how they become better people for having known each other. Like he did with the Kite Runner, Hosseini paints a detailed portrait of the horrors that fell over Afghanistan from the time the Soviets invaded, to the fall (for now) of the Taliban. I guess it's a testament to his beautiful writing that more than once as I was reading the novel, I stopped to think of how thankful I was to be living in America, where I don't have to wear a burqa, can have a job, and don't have to be in the company of a male relative when I want to leave the house. It's hard to understand how the Taliban got away with enforcing their abhorrent rules and unfathomable treatment of women, and it makes it even harder to comprehend when you become invested in the main characters, and see them and the people they love having to suffer these kind of injustices on a daily basis.     I saw a lot of reviews here that mention they think The Kite Runner is a superior novel. While I highly enjoyed that one as well, I think as an independent woman, I really liked A Thousand Splendid Suns and could identify with it more. For being a man, Hosseini did an amazing job of capturing the female spirit and sense of motherhood. For the first time in a while, I found myself staying up late at night because I couldn't stop reading, and thinking about the characters while I was going about my daily business, wondering what was going to happen to them.     There are scenes in the book that detail the horrors of abuse, murder, destruction, etc... that may be hard for some readers to handle. However, I think that we, especially us Americans that live cushy lives that wetake for granted sometimes, need to be educated about the injustices that people in other countries have to endure, otherwise we could very easily end up with another Holocaust someday. If you can stomach the darker parts, the overall theme of love and redemption more than balance it out in the end.    While the women suffer greatly throughout the piece, this is really a tale of love. Love between friends that grows into something more. Love between women that originally, are fatefully thrown together under strange circumstances, but somehow grow to be each other's saving graces. Love between parents and children that reign over all else. Love for a country and culture that has been needlessly destroyed, but will rebuild and flourish once again.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|I just watched this great DVD and had to get a couple thoughts out there.<br /><br />The only previous version I had of this film was a VHS recording from cable TV years ago - so not the best sound or picture.  This DVD is obviously MUCH better than that!  The anamorphic widescreen and relatively clean transfer are wonderful, as is the remastered sound.  I've always remembered this as an extremely scary movie and parts definitely still made me jump (OMG, that clown!!) and was surprised to see it was only PG (not even PG-13).  Amazing how PG can scare you when done right.<br /><br />I am one of those who watches extras and am disappointed in the fact that there simply aren't any of real interest or that go in-depth about the movie itself.  However, as others have noted, my main goal is to watch a movie I love so I'll enjoy what I have and hope a special edition comes along in the future (preferably remastered in high def).<br /><br />Sadly, that glaring edit mentioned by another reviewer about the previous DVD edition is still in this version - and it is glaring.  All I can figure is that the master used was badly damaged at that point and no one has been able to find another copy to use to fix that segment.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie transfer and a joy to watch again.  I'm glad to have this quality transfer.  I just wish they had been able to fix the editing error and give a look behind the scenes.
B000I2MRHE|5.0|My little one has never been interested in tummy time.  I purchased this in hopes of making it a little more exciting for him and it worked!  He loves looking at himself in the mirror or listening to the crinkle of the leaves or wings when his hands move over them.  I know he's not meaning to just yet, but he's been able to move himself around and has been able to enjoy all the sections of this gym.    I would highly recommend it for babies who are less than happy with tummy time!

0312323867|3.0|I'm definitely in the minority here, but I was very disappointed by this book. None of the characters are very appealing. Yes, in the beginning, the main character, Darcy, is very selfish and manipulative. But her bad behavior doesn't justify all the self-righteous actions of everyone else. In my opinion, so-called \\"best friend\\" Rachel gets off way too easy. What kind of person sleeps with her best friend's fiance??? No matter how you look at it, Rachel isn't an honest character. She's written as the \\"nice\\" one, but I didn't find her likable. Dex, the ex-fiance, and childhood friend Ethan aren't much better. They spend altogether too much time criticizing Darcy. I didn't feel any sympathy for Dex. He actually takes Rachel along on what would have been his honeymoon with Darcy--and neither he nor Rachel seem to feel at all guilty or awkward about this. And nerdy Ethan is so judgmental, I couldn't understand why Darcy ends up falling for him. The plot is very predictable and ultimately a letdown. Somewhere in the middle of the book, Darcy undergoes a metamorphosis. By the end, the old Darcy is completely gone. The new and supposedly improved Darcy is a like a brand-new person--she changes so much, she's practically a candidate for sainthood! But I'm giving the book 3 stars because Emily Giffin is a very talented writer who has a gift with words. If you're looking for very light entertainment, you might enjoy this book. But if prefer fiction with a bit more depth and believabilty, you'll probably want to skip this book. I was looking for a fun read, but I can't believe I wasted my time reading this.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I won't reiterate the plot here since other reviews have described the film in sufficient detail, but merely want to make a point about Verhoeven's work, that this film in particular helped me see. While \\"Black Book\\" may seem a far cry from Total Recall, Robocop, Basic Instinct, Showgirls and Starship Troopers (some of Verhoeven's best known Hollywood films) it shares with each of these films Verhoeven's keen insight into what makes a genre film tick and his perverse delight in undercutting and challenging the dichotomies and distinctions that tend to characterize standard genre films. This is Verhoeven's first Dutch film in a long time, and it recalls some of his early films before he went to Hollywood at the same time as it shows his fascination with the way in which films that recall conventional genres carry with them a set of audience expectations that can be played with and twisted.  This film, beautifully shot and with exceptional performances, is an emotional roller coaster in which the viewer gets caught up in the excitement of an escape, then horrified by tragedy, then engaged by romance, then titillated by eroticism, then horrified as the heroine falls in love with someone we are conditioned to hate, then sympathizing with the enemy, then .... and so on.  Verhoeven can make you laugh out loud and a moment later gasp in disgust and then become fascinated and then afraid.  The film is nothing less than wildly entertaining, but at the same time (like all of his films) is underscored by Paul Verhoeven's intriguing brand of humanism: he recognizes and insists that there is no good and evil and that all of us are in some way compromised and yet holds out a hope and a conviction that there is the possibility of heroically, out of love and genuine fellow feeling, rising above the endless intrigue and selfishness and cruel lust and war that he clearly depicts as the dominating force of human experience.  At the same time, he recognizes that this very hope and belief in love and human dignity is a fragile thing because it is so easily manipulated and there are so many who out of greed for power and money will manipulate this hope.  His films remain compelling for continuing to hold out that hope, and for the genuine affection they display for even his most flawed characters.ef in love and human dignity is a fragile thing because it is so easily manipulated and there are so many who out of greed for power and money will manipulate this hope.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|\\"The Lives of Others\\" brilliantly captures the fault in societies in which citizens have no protection against their governments by weaving a story of ambition, betrayal, and redemption around wiretapping in Cold War East Germany. In 1984, the Stasi, or East German Secret Police, intend to know everything about every citizen and are free to accuse and imprison without evidence in the defense of the Socialist State. A staunch proponent of these values, Captain Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is assigned by his career-minded superior Lt. Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) to wiretap the apartment of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). The Operation is instigated by a powerful politician, Minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme), who desires Dreyman's actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck).<br /><br />\\"The Lives of Others\\" depicts a touchy subject in recent German history, as hundreds of thousands of people in the GRD acted as informers for the Stasi. The film takes on a different significance in the post-9/11 United States, this era of warrantless wiretaps and extensive surveillance. It reminds me of Francis Ford Coppola's exceptional film \\"The Conversation\\", also about the effects of wiretapping on a surveillant and his subjects, released on the heels of the Watergate scandal in 1974. The torment of living under a security-obsessed regime comes across powerfully in \\"The Lives of Others\\". But no less powerful is the film's exploration of the economics of paranoia, when power substitutes for accomplishment and petty ambition masquerades as idealism. \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a beautifully crafted, personal, suspenseful story with rapier political insight.

0316010669|3.0|This book was an interesting read until I reached the chapter \\"Seven seconds in the bronx\\"  I disagree that police officers should be taught to look at a persons face when most officers are killed by the HANDS of another person.  I agree that a lot can be learned by evaluating a person's facial expressions; however, I am always skeptical about persons who second guess anothers actions.  I had an appreciation for the book as a whole.  I would never encourage a police officer to focus on an offenders facial expression, PERIOD!  Take a ride in a patrol car and see what body part you focus on.
0783225725|5.0|Only Clint Eastwood could play a character who drifts in to a small western town, order the towns people to paint everything red, and then rename the town \\"Hell\\". Eastwood plays a mysterious drifter in this film, who is followed by a very chilling tune throughout the movie. With some townspeople at his side, and others wishing him dead, the town comes to him for aid due to the coming release of three criminals the townspeople put in jail. With the criminals released, it's evident they'll come back into the small town of Lago looking for revenge, but as it turn out Clint has some avenging to do himself. Great film that gives off an extremely powerful feel of mystery and suspense, a definite must see!
B000002ADT|5.0|I can't tell you how many people I've heard say \\"even if you don't like jazz, you'll love this album\\"!  This is beyond true.  I've always been into all types of music, as long as it sounds good.  This album is not only a classic, but Miles Davis set a standard on jazz with this masterpiece.  It contains some lengthy numbers but at the same time, it really sets the mood.  If you enjoy this album as much as I do, also check out \\"Miles Ahead\\", \\"Relaxin\\", \\"Walkin\\", and \\"Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud (Lift To The Scaffold): Original Soundtrack\\".  Take a listen and enjoy!
B000RIHBIE|2.0|I'm not a Sum41 fan who will love whatever they produce even if it sucks. But I'm not anti either, I do like them and think they are tallented, especially for their age. I enjoyed all their previous albums, especially Chuck. But I'm very disapointed with this one.  Some compared it to American Idiot, and that's exactly what I thought. There is too much likeness to not call it a rip off. As I said, I'm not sum41 hater, but it's too obvious, you can pretty much pick any song and find on green day's album which one it was inspired of. It's not so much in the lyrics (well, not only) but every little effect, guitar riff, solo, sounds way too familiar. Except \\"Ma Poubelle\\" (my little trashcan), where Deryck tries to sing phonetically in french, so bad it's funny. But song So Long Goodbye, is just a clone of Good Riddance, also from Greenday's Nimrod. Add the fact they now dress exactly the same... Well they are also three now, but you can't blame them for that. But Dave took the little metal touch with him.

B000V4UFZK|4.0|Jim Hemphill from reel dot com says it best  \\"Unfortunately, given the movie's contentious production history, the DVD contains no commentary track and no making-of documentary--25 years after the fact, the participants still won't talk about what went down on the set\\".  Doesn't that make the film more eerie and mysterious with all the talk of the curse behind the movie.<br /><br />Mysterious things like Dominique Dunne who played the oldest sister who's only movie was Poltergeist and who was choked to death that year by a boyfriend.<br /><br />Heather O'Rourke who played Carol Ann who only appeared in the Poltergeist trilogy and the same year part III was released died of initially described as an acute form of influenza but later changed to septic shock after bacterial toxins invaded her bloodstream.<br /><br />Oliver Robins who played Robbie during the clown scene where he is being choked by a clown in his room, something went wrong with the prop and Robins was actually being choked and Spielberg had to rush in to help him.  This is included in the jacket of the original release.<br /><br />I also read an interview with Zelda Rubinstein that played Tangina on Movie web website a couple of days ago and there is a somber feel of her interview when commenting on the film, this was just a feeling I got.<br /><br />Jim Hemphill from reeldotcom also points out the clash between director Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974) and Spielberg who wrote and produced and describes how their styles turn out one good horror film, he makes a lot of good points and I recommend taking a look at his review if your a fan of Poltergeist on Reeldotcom.<br /><br />Another of Hemphill's points I would agree with is his comment of Poltergeist being \\"touching and horrific at the same time\\".  I felt the strongest performance was between Jobeth Williams who played Carol Anne's mom and Heather O'Rourke who played Carol Anne it was indeed touching and Jobeth gave a solid performance.  Oscar winner Beatrice Straight also portrays a believable connection with the mother.  Last but certainly not least Zelda Rubinstein playing Tangina with limited screen time and standing at only 4' 3\\" tall she gives a big performance and steals the scenes she is in.<br /><br />I think Spielberg is a genius of a director and can take things to the limits himself but I could feel his influence on this film which Tobe Hooper directed and not in a good way.  It had a happy feel like from E.T. and the music to me just didn't fit.  Although on the flip side the music and effects I'm not in agreement with are the 3 Oscar nominations the film received, so maybe I'm wrong and the effects are just dated and were amazing in 1982.<br /><br />All the talk about the curse and the mystery is freaky stuff.  I firmly believe what you don't see can be much scarier and your imagination will fill in the blanks with something far worse.  That being said I felt some of the special effects very dated and crossed over into Sci-Fi instead of staying with horror.<br /><br />Great examples of subtle, effective, and scary moments:  The mother fixing the chairs and turning around and there all on the table: Freaky.  The Clown in the chair and then not in the chair: Freaky.  Carol Anne just sitting and talking to the television at first:  Freaky.  Hearing the voices mumble back oh so slightly:  Freaky.<br /><br />Some perhaps over the top venturing into Sci Fi and loosing some horror:  The Clown with a different face on it once it attacks, although it'll make you jump initially just a bit over the top and not so eerie.  The tree as a kid was very scary to me but this time around it looked pretty fake and the fact it comes in the window to eat the kid, again over the top.  Some of the ghosts at the end were something I remember seeing in Ghostbusters and the house crumbling up into the ground again Sci Fi ish and over the top.<br /><br />Without a doubt there were many many moments that were genuinely scary and stick with you and it is a good horror film that should be in every horror fans collection but I felt it could've been so much more in terms of actually horrific.  Maybe Hooper can do his own remake and go to as dark a place as he wants.<br /><br />To recap you don't get commentary talking about what went down on the dvd but in my opinion it keeps the mystery of the film going.  I recently watched the older version on dvd still available and the picture quality needed an upgrade and to quote Hemphill again \\"the gorgeous transfer on this disc beautifully preserves some of the most elegant widescreen compositions and expressive lighting effects since the glory days of Nicholas Ray and Vincente Minnelli.  Along with a few new interesting features at a good price.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is a timeless classic that all collectors must have in their collections. Wonderful humor and animation. A must see for film buffs who have not gotten to see this on the big screen.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|I rented this on the premise that liberals make better movies Why? I don't know - perhaps they're just into it more, their passion, their beards and long sleeve T-shirts flapping in the wind. Ten years ago (when I was 22) I was just such a person. Then I would have loved this movie, now, well.....    1. Brad and Cate Blanchett leave their kids to the care of a Mexican to tour Morocco or Algeria or wherever on a bus. What? The mexican then kidnaps the children in order to attend her son's wedding in Mexico. The children don't object and of course have the time of their lives as all Mexicans are just great people. Trouble happens at the border. Borders between nation states - what fascism!    2. A deaf mute Japanese girl shows her beaver in a cafe and then takes some drugs and, oh what the heck, who frickin cares?    There's a lot more I could say, but I won't. And of course multiple stories with threads attaching 'em - done and dusted by Robert Altman in Short Cuts way back in the early 1990s.....

B000SQJ2SC|4.0|Not only does Kanye seem like a cool person and dresses well, but the boy can make an album. With the whole competition between him and 50 cent I wanted to hear for myself which was better. Although I did like fifty's album, Kanye's was much smarter. I don't like it when all a rap artist can talk about is Ho's and drug dealing. You can still have a good rap album without making everything about that, and Kanye has succeeded in doing this with Graduation. With fresh beats and fun lyrics Graduation is a good continuation from Late Registration. There are a few songs that weren't my favorites but weren't bad. My favorites have to be Champion (only wish it was longer, but my favorite), Stronger, Good Life f/T-Pain, The Glory, and Big Brother (homage to Jay-Z). If your a Kanye fan you will love this album, and if your not traditionally a rap fan you will also enjoy it. But if you don't want any explicit language spend the few extra bucks and get the edited version, it's just as good.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Knowing that Im into historical reinactment (mostly vikings & their predessors) one of my friends bought me this for my birthday.  I nearly killed him as I exected this to be another unwatchable pile of garbage like Pathfinder.  However, I owed him a major apology as Beowulf & Grendel turned out to be an excellent movie.      Somehow, with a fairly low budget, they pulled it off.  They knew when and where to put the money for the best result & did so.  Excellently writen, it stays very close to the real story of Beowulf.  The plotline was simple, but it didnt lack depth to it. The armor, weapons, clothing, building, etc.  were simple, functional, and fairly historically accurate.  The landsacpe it was filmed it made for breathtaking backgrounds.  And they gained major bonus points by actually adding depth to Grendel: they portray him as an intelligent being, and not just a mindless monster.      Beowulf is an action movie with intelligence that bears more resemblance to the older epics rather than a modern slash-em-up.  It does justice to the story, and I am very happy to have it on my shelf.  If you like historical movies similar to \\"13th Warrior\\" and \\"Tristan & Isolde\\" I highly reccomend this movie.

Made me choke up on several occasions.      Marcus Luttrell is a true American hero in every sense of the word.  BUY THIS BOOK, you wont regret it.

I like this book the twits because I never seen old people do funny stuff like what they do. They make things out of animals like bird pie. I like when they get mad at each other. These old hags are so scary they don't need to dress up for Halloween. The twits are the funniest hags I ever seen.
B00005JLCI|4.0|At last, at last, at last - although I had to buy it from the States, as Amazon UK don't stock it! Unbelievable, I know.  Anyway, the film is a feast of fine acting - if you try to ignore Charlton Heston and Jack Lemmon, who are, I'm afraid, quite dreadful. Apart from that, this dvd is over four hours of Shakespearian bliss! Branagh is my hero, he has helped me to show my children how wonderful the Bard's works can be, when they are presented with such natural honesty, and when they have not been too changed. There really is no need to present Shakespeare in gangland New York or in a post-apocalyptic wasteland!

B00005OM4K|5.0|IHMO, t's a better option to buy this box set instead of buying the single albums. I have both. The sound is better, crisper than ever and the packaging is great but it's a pity that the box isn't the wood one anymore.    My only complain is that Fantasy Records has cut some album between CDs on the box set (Platinum, for instance) but the running time of Cosmo Factory (45 min.) is longer than the previous albums from CRR. The CDs 2-3 contains two albums each. The first is devoted to pre-CCR stuff. The last one contains live cuts from The Concert and Live in Europe.    Also you get all the non-album tracks they release.    Enjoy!
B000RMQH30|5.0|As I live in Brazil i thought that I would have some shipping problem and/or some kind of delay but I was happilly and completelly wrong!!!    The CD arrived perfectly on time and shape and it is just one of the best Ben Harper's cd ever!    Thank you Amazon for the Amazing service!    I hope that i'll buy something again really soon!

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I loved the movie and this CD is a way to keep the experience - the music with its wonderful melodies and poetic words is haunting and beautiful. My only complaint is the words were not included but this was remedied with a Google search.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I know this can be considered a book review but please humor me.  I just finished reading a beautiful book by Robin McKinley entitled \\"Beauty - a retelling of the story of Beauty and the Beast.\\"  It is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. The imagery is so imaginative and vivid, I could swear I'd read it before. Then I realized that, though I hadn't read this book before, I had seen it. Disney's beautiful version of Beauty and the Beast uses much of the imagery McKinley utilizes in her book. I'm not saying that the stories are by any means identical. For example McKinley's story is quite a bit different than Disney's tale in that Beauty has two sisters (who aren't ugly or wicked) who figure prominently in the story. It is the imagery that is similar. The candles and lamps that light themselves, a magical teapot, a magical and self-serving feast that dances across a very long dining table, a huge and friendly Clydesdale-like horse, a walking footstool, a magic rose that signals the end of the beast's chance at love, a magical wardrobe in Beauty's room, birds that eat from her hand, the beast's inability to manage silverware when eating, a stained glass window that describes the downfall of a privileged young man, a mirror-like table through which Beauty can view her family's activities, and much more - right up to the bells, chimes, fireworks and wind that accompany the Beast's metamorphosis. Also, Disney's Beast is a nearly identical physical match for the Beast described by McKinley. The similarities were so uncanny that I popped in my old VHS copy of Disney's movie to view the credits. So much of Disney's animated imagery is lifted directly from McKinley's novel - which was written in 1978 - that I could not believe McKinley's name did not appear in the story credits! How unfair! I wonder if McKinley consulted a lawyer. Be that as it may, if you love this movie, you will love reading this book.
B000GC9NE6|2.0|I guess my problem with this movie comes from the fact I am a massive David Lynch fan. I didnt enjoy this, in fact it put me to sleep and then inspired miserable dreams.   This is for the fans only, fans of what exactly, I am not sure. If you want to see a good, wierd David Lynch movie, watch Blue Velvet. Otherwise I am not sure exactly what drug you need to take to enjoy this flick!
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I believe that it is somewhat unfortunate that most people, prior to listening to this CD, have an opinion on what to expect, and it usually revolves around Pearl Jam.  Love them or hate them, they have been around long enough that most people have their opinions of the band or their lead vocalist.  However, this CD is decidedly NOT Pearl Jam, in the best sort of way.  It's ironic that the foundation of Pearl Jam's career and image was based around teen emotion (I think the popular term is usually angst)and this CD is very much about a young adult's struggle to define himself.  This CD has some anger, but not the savage and extroverted anger that defined the grunge era.  This is a very introspective, thought provoking, and melodic work of art.  Even without seeing the movie, or knowing the CD was inspired by and was written for the movie, the music evokes images of nature, of sitting on a log near a stream solving the world's problems or in an expansive field in the shade of the only tree for hundreds of yards.  I have always loved Pearl Jam's aggressive and emotional \\"hard rock\\" songs, but I also have always loved (and collected) acoustic performances.  To me, this collection is what Counting Crows could not be (only because I prefer Eddie's voice to Adam's) and what John Mellencamp attempts to be at times (though his lyrics often fall short).  I am also struck by how perfectly the album cover fits the content.  It is a great CD!  Buy it, and go into it with an open mind and try to experience it for what it is, not what you expected it to be.
0743486285|5.0|This is a really interesting book-couldn't put it down only took me 3 days to read. Very good book!
0143038419|3.0|Things fall apart for Ms. Gilbert so she goes abroad to find herself and figure things out.  So she travels, she reflects and she eats alot.     I have learned a few things after reading this book.  If you eat alot of gelato you will gain weight. India is very hot. Even in paradise, people will try to scam you. Well, yes, there are many obvious observations like this in the book.        Also, I really question the premise of the book.  I really dislike the the idea that she received an advance to create a book about finding yourself.  If you are listening to me book publisher, give me an advance and I will travel and have witty things to say about different cultures too!!!       I think I liked this book for all the wrong reasons.  I couldn't believe anybody would subject themselves to the harshness of that Indian ashram. I found it very funny that she went to India and they basically put her to work cleaning floors.  And she meditated alot.  Wow, it really sounded like a cult, hard work and an enigmatic leader ! I couldn't wait to read about Bali!  And it didn't dissapoint!      If you want to read the story of a flaky writer who goes abroad and is very SERIOUS about her life journey then this book is for you!  Don't forget about the gelato warning!
B00000F6LQ|5.0|This is a classic that everyone with a sense of humor should see. For those of you who are big fans of this movie, the extra bits are worth it. Michael Palin and Terry Jones go back to the actual location where they film the part, \\"The Castle Anthrax\\".There is a small script book and a film slide(very cool). I know that many people don't like Monty Python, but like I said, if you have a sense of humor, this flick is a great choice. I have watched this movie hundreds of times, knowing almost the whole script, so when the added and extended scenes play, I really noticed the difference!
006091307X|2.0|To say this book is odd would be an understatement. It almost feels like it induces paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions all at once. I can't say I really enjoyed reading it -- with the exception of the first chapter, which was quite fun -- but I did appreciate it. I found Pynchon's sense of humor very entertaining -- my particular favorite character name being Genghis Cohen -- but the plot became so convoluted that I just kind of gave up trying to figure it out. I think that was sort of the point, though: giving up on \\"reality\\" and just accepting the absurdity and uncertainty. In the 1960s when this was written, I have no doubt his style was novel and groundbreaking. Now, it just seems to be a case of \\"been there, done that.\\" I appreciate the satire, but think its message is still eluding me. Maybe it will come to me down the line, perhaps through that nebulous, conspiratorial entity Pynchon attempts to expose: The Postal Service!

0783116934|3.0|After more than a decade of its original showing I may have expected a lot but the problems of converting an episode for TV into a DVD movie are obvious. This movie is more for the TV-couch and suffers in todays 5.1 and 7.1 home-theater setups where it is a poor showing.     The guy in the lead role is too rigid and even one smile from him would have made a big difference. However he cries pathetically in more than one scene and it looked very overdone. The rest of the cast all seem equally rigid - sit rigid, walk, talk rigid like statues dressed in neat clothing. All very TV show like. Compared to today's action-oriented world of C.S.I and other crime investigation shows on T.V the movie is a poor match although it is based on a true-life story of a serial killer, the notorious Ukranian, Chikatilo.     There could have certainly been more punch and drama to the story line if only they had included scenes showing arresting the wrong person for an earlier crime done by Chikatilo and even having that wrong person executed.    Another very untoward scene was the General's speech, exhorting his men to co-operate in the search but asking them to repeat after him things like \\"Yes, I will perform my duty\\", \\"I will this..and that..\\". It looked silly and that too coming from the Soviets. The scene could have been  presented in a better fashion or even deleted.    The pluses are its lovely background score. And Thanks to Donald who offered some respite and smiled keeping the viewer to look forward to something. The movie does indicate how very sensitive children can become dangerous adults in society if they have a difficult childhood and if parent's and guardians don't understand their sensitiveness.    As a TV movie it might have excelled but as a DVD movie it fails to impress. Watch it if you need to know the story of one of the most heinous of all serial killers.    2.5 stars only.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|The reason that so many people have complained about the sound quality of this album, is because it is mixed with the guitars turned up too loud.  The result is that it does not sound like the E Street Band. From \\"Born to Run\\" to \\"Born in the USA\\", the mix that let the E Street Band's sound come through, is one where Roy Bittan's piano, and Danny Federici's organ and Max's drums were all up in the mix. Bruce's guitars were mixed in very low. This let Bruce's vocals shine through. To be honest, Bruce's guitar playing is average at best. His simplistic licks are not going to be copied by any aspiring player. They compliment the band when turned down low, almost hidden in the mix. Even on the guitar heavy Darkness album, the guitars are set back in the mix. With Magic, the guitars are up so loud and out front that they are drowning out the rest of the band as well as being on top of Bruce's vocals. The guitar parts are so basic and uninteresting, when they are placed up front in the mix, they kill the band and the song. This album could have been a lot better with a producer who understood what made the E Street band so great in the first place.    One last point, am I the only one who thinks that Radio Nowhere is a rip off of 867-5309 Jenny? The opening guitar riff is so close to that song, I think Bruce should send them royalties
B000AJJNPY|5.0|My soul soars when listening to Glosoli. It has an ethereal, other worldly quality about it. And it has a wonderful climax and release that is worth the wait. If you watch the video of this track, you can begin to understand the metaphor at a soul level. The other tracks are also superb. This is not ordinary music. It affects me at a very deep emotional level. I feel healed after listening to it. Give it a try. I think you will agree with my assessment of its transformative power and beauty.
B000UR366S|2.0|The lyrics are (mostly) feeble. Craftless and dull, doing little to serve her sentiments. Music's good, though.
B00000AFDW|2.0|Question: What do you do when you once ruled the heap of the hard rock world and you have since seen your record and ticket sales slide down faster than one can say the words \\"Lick It Up\\"?  Answer: You make nice with the other two original band members, stage a public reunion on MTV, reinstate all the gimmicks that once helped you gain notoriety, and cut an album that promises to relive said glory days.  Then you continue recording album after album to solidify in people's minds that you are, indeed, back to kick the proverbial hiney.    Oh, wait . . . whoops . . . so much for the string of albums.  What happened to those creative juices, eh?  Well, truth be told, they weren't even to be found on the ONE reunion album, really.  Listening to \\"Psycho Circus\\" when it first came out almost ten years ago, one quickly got the idea that this was a desperate attempt to get people to like the KISS machine again.  You certainly can't argue with the tenacity and business conscience of Gene and Paul.  They have always known how to get our attention.    Trouble is, that is all this album really has going for it.  Throughout the album, these four aging rockers (really, Gene and Paul only, if the rumors be true) continually plagiarize . . . um, themselves.  They took all the cliches of their past and lopped them onto this CD.  \\"I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock and Roll\\", \\"You Wanted the Best\\" and \\"Raise Your Glasses\\" are merely \\"Rock and Roll All Night\\" clones, drumming into your head the same silly message.  And they could have picked a better song to clone, really.  I mean, I know it's their signature song but really folks, it's kind of a dopey song.  Don't believe me?  Count how many times they sing the title.  Exactly.  Oh, and we mustn't forget \\"Beth\\" Part II (THIS time it's personal!!): \\"I Finally Found My Way\\" is Peter Criss's one contribution to this album, of any worthy (sort of) note.    Still, they are KISS, and we do tend to like these Superheroes of Rock for what they have done to lift music out of the doldrums of complacency in the past, don't we?  Look at how many bands (to this day!) who cite them as influences.  Which is why I suppose I can't give this review only one star.  I still hold a special place in my heart for this band, being my first taste of the crazy vortex of my metal world so many years ago.  And really, the title track and Gene's thank you to the fans, \\"We Are One\\", are pretty decent songs.  So maybe on a less sarcastic day, I could see my thoughts inching up to two and a half stars.  But overall this album really falls flat on it's corporate, cash-grab face.
B00006YXOX|5.0|I agree with the majority of reviewers on this website that Jochum's \\"classic\\" DG Bruckner cycle is more than worth its modest cost.  This is the set to go for if you haven't yet come to appreciate Bruckner or have heard one or two of these works and want to explore his symphonic canon further.  You won't be diasppointed.  The two orchestras featured in this set (the BPO and the BRSO) play splendidly for Jochum, and this veteran Brucknerian knows exactly how to draw the right \\"Bruckner sound\\" (the aural equivalent of an Alpine vista) from them.  In matters of interpretation, Jochum's manner remains controversial.  His tendency to pull tempos about, and to speed up in the approach to climaxes has called forth objections from many critics, and will put some listeners off.  On the other hand, this very tendency creates a dramatic urgency, a spontaneous combustion, that is just right for those who might previously have found Bruckner long-winded or dull.<br /><br />In the DG cycle, Jochum is at his absolute best in symphonies 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7.  He provides a sense of mystery and anticipation at the outset of each of these works which draws one into Bruckner's unique sound-world.  I marginally prefer Karajan in 1 and Giulini in 2, but recognize that Jochum is about on a par with them. I have other, and stronger, preferences in nos. 5, 6, 8 and 9, though Jochum is undeniably exciting in all of these scores, even if he doesn't fully grasp the grandeur of no. 8 and the harrowing tragic vision of no. 9.  In the former he's too conventionally \\"romantic\\" (making the music sound like long-winded Schumann) and in the latter he treats Bruckner's astonishing dissonances and other near-expressionistic gestures too gently.<br /><br />The sound quality on these discs is far from up-to-date, but not bad.  One wants a greater dynamic range and sense of expansiveness, but the remastering has helped to clarify and solidify the sonic image.<br /><br />There really is no single Bruckner cycle that will satisfy every listener in every one of the symphonies.  Jochum's later EMI set is crudely played (at least to my ears) and brashly recorded.  Karajan is massive, olympian, and hieratic--which works better in 5, 8 and 9 than in some of the other symphonies (his no. 6 is weak, and 1-3 are subverted by horribly strident early-digital recording).  Haitink is the most natural-sounding Brucknerian of all, and the Concertgebouw paints with vivid, Rembrandt-like colors.  But Haitink can be uninspired, and frankly dull over long stretches (particularly in slow movements).  Skrowaczewski secures some good playing from his provincial band in the early symphonies, but when the going gets rough, as in the more challenging later works, they are simply not up to the task.  Skrowaczewski has one great advantage, however: his is the only complete cycle to include both non-canonical symphonies (nos. 0 and 00, so-called) as well as a beautifully rendered orchestral transcription of the Adagio from the f-minor String Quintet.  He does particularly well with these \\"non-canonical\\" works, too, giving far more convincing accounts of them than Tintner, Ashkenazy, Haitink and others that I have heard.  Solti is uneven in Bruckner, and Chailly a bit bland in comparison with Karajan and Jochum. Wand has some telling moments, but overall I find him too sober (and the playing of the Cologne orchestra variable in his first cycle for RCA/BMG).  Celibidache's incomplete cycles (3-8, EMI or DG) are remarkable for their slow tempos and \\"contemplative\\" aura; not for the neophyte, but for dedicated Brucknerians who want to savor every measure.<br /><br />Thus by default, if nothing else, the Jochum DG cycle wins out at the best boxed set of the symphonies.  If I had to assemble an optimal Bruckner cycle, however, the following would be my list of \\"best ever\\" versions followed in each case by my candidate for \\"next best\\":<br /><br />Symphony no. 1:  Karajan/DG (despite the strident recording);  Skrowaczewski/Oehms<br />Symphony no. 2:  Giulini/EMI; Horst Stein (recently reissued on Decca/Eloquence)<br />Symphony no. 3 (1889 version): B&ouml;hm/Decca (hard to find); Schuricht (recently reissued on Preiser)<br />Symphony no. 4:  Celibidache/EMI; B&ouml;hm (Decca)<br />Symphony no. 5:  Karajan (DG); Horenstein (live performance, reissued on several labels)<br />Symphony no. 6:  Klemperer (EMI); Horst Stein (recently reissued on Decca/Eloquence)<br />Symphony no. 7:  Karajan (EMI); Solti/Chicago (a minority view, to be sure)<br />Symphony no. 8:  F&uuml;rtw&auml;ngler/1944 (in DG commemorative box); Karajan/Vienna (DG)<br />Symphony no. 9:  F&uuml;rtw&auml;ngler/DG; Walter (Sony, generously coupled with a fine *Te Deum*)<br /><br />In the end, however, Bruckner's music is \\"greater than it can ever be played\\" to cite Schnabel's famous estimation of the Beethoven's sonatas, so the listener will always find some measure of insufficiency in every performance.2:  Giulini/EMI; Horst Stein (recently reissued on Decca/Eloquence)   Symphony no. 3 (1889 version): Böhm/Decca (hard to find); Schuricht (recently reissued on Preiser)  Symphony no. 4:  Celibidache/EMI; Böhm (Decca)  Symphony no. 5:  Karajan (DG); Horenstein (live performance, reissued on several labels)  Symphony no. 6:  Klemperer (EMI); Horst Stein (recently reissued on Decca/Eloquence)  Symphony no. 7:  Karajan (EMI); Solti/Chicago (a minority view, to be sure)  Symphony no. 8:  Fürtwängler/1944 (in DG commemorative box); Karajan/Vienna (DG)  Symphony no. 9:  Fürtwängler/DG; Walter (Sony, generously coupled with a fine *Te Deum*)    In the end, however, Bruckner's music is \\"greater than it can ever be played\\" to cite Schnabel's famous estimation of the Beethoven's sonatas, so the listener will always find some measure of insufficiency in every performance.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|What can I say...it's a Disney Classic. It's great the Disney finally chose to put it on DVD, it's a nice addition to our collection.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Loreena is just My Favorate,,,this CD and DVD is just wonderful... She and her band are so diverse,, watching this DVD you see just how much Joy she gets from performing... Seeing all the different instruments used by her and her band too, make you understand why she is so awesomely different than other celtic singers... I highly recomend this Set to anyone who loves celtic music... The thing that sets her out, (I Think) is that she uses the Old Stories and tales to bring this culture to life... She is Wonderful.
0525950079|5.0|Ken Follett was only twenty-seven when he wrote Eye of the Needle, the award-winning novel which became an international bestseller and a distinguished film. Before that, he had been a newspaper reporter and a publishing executive after studying philosophy at University College, London. He has since written ten equally successful novels and the non-fiction bestseller, On Wings of Eagles. Ken Follett lives with his family in London and Stevenage.    This book is the sequel to The Pillars of the Earth, abook written 18 years ago, in 1989 and a book that was one of my favourites of all time, along with Sarum by Edward Rutherford. 18 years is a long time to wait for a sequel to any book but it is well over a thousand pages and as I have read The Pillars of the Earth several times since it was published, my recollections of it are still good.    World without end begins its story in 1327 and follows the lives of four children, who slip away from the cathedral city of Kingsbridge. The children are not only from different backgrounds but their personalities could not be more different either. After leaving the city together they see two men brutally killed in the forest. Little do they know it but the killings they have witnessed will affect them all through their lives.    Between them they will witness and suffer everything that the world can throw at them and their ups and downs  within the historical changes that take placethroughout their lives, makes for fascinating reading.    Ken Follett is a master of this type of historical fiction and I am amazed that he has not written this book before now, but also grateful that he has now, finally published what I am sure will be a best seller for years to come. Books of this stature do not come along very often.
B000A2VMV4|3.0|This is a great piece of Historical Fiction, I believe that it represents Christopher Columbus to a tee!  I liked the cast, many of these actors are famous and a good number of supporting roles I recognized from other films. The beginning is a bit boring but don't let that stop you from seeing it.  Illustrious and exciting!

B000002OOY|5.0|Considering how much I never really liked the Jurassic movies, I really do like the music. I remember how my freshman year of high school my music teacher had us play the main theme at our band show and I still feel amazed every time I hear it. Thanks Mr. C. What I am basically saying is lousy movie, great score!
074356619X|1.0|I purchased the audio book since I am in my car most of the time being a mom and running around town. I actually threw one of the CD's out the window. I didn't like this theory. I felt it left out \\"GOD\\" in this whole picture.<br />Not for me.
0805079831|5.0|A brilliant yet terrifying in-depth look at what we have become, what our tax dollars support and the takeover of human dignity we have condoned in the name of economic superiority.    Klein's book is brilliant and reads like espionage fiction! From her descriptions of public disorientation bordering on emotional slavery, coupled with physical assault after natural disasters, terrorist attacks and eventually government takeover and exploitation Klein's thesis is the ultimate reality check. State Sponsored and Supported terrorism is alive and well, practiced and perfected on a daily basis securing and ensuring total control! Disaster capitalism for the sake of preserving \\"neoliberal economics\\" and Klein's no frills revelation is in a language we all understand. Ecowiz Milton Friedman ranks with Oppenheimer and Hitler as an architect of mass-destruction perfecting the ultimate coup. Resulting the development of lurking in wait or initiating the crisis tactics, openly dividing the spoils, selling off to private individuals or corporations while the victims remain traumatized and led to believe it's all for the greater good until the life and economic changes are permanent with a Burger and fries on the side. It's Apple Pie Economics with a twist of sadism.    One is left reminded of the well quoted Turkish Proverb \\"When the axe came into the forest the trees said don't worry the handle is one of us\\"!    This book makes a difference - someone needs to.    M. D. Johnson  Author: \\"Circle Around The Sun - Part One Of The ISIS PROJECT\\"

B000TGCR38|3.0|Now that he's lost both his DPs (Jan & Jost) and composers (Basil & Jerry), Verhoeven finds himself in a situation not unlike Hitchcock did from Torn Curtain onwards. Choreographed camera-moves and modernist soundscapes make way for academic multi-camera and a mushy score, yet the re-teaming with scriptwriter Soeteman packs some punch and make for an engaging plot, carried along by a stellar cast. Even a minor Verhoeven pic is still fascinating to watch and I had to devour this DVD complete with its trademark commentary.
B000H30B2C|3.0|This movies was ok, not the greatest but not the worst I've seen, a bit long for my taste, but then again Jackson has a love for long movies, I think the reason the extended play worked for the Rings movies, was because most people were not familiar with Tolkien's work and  you wanted to see what was next, but with Kong, it is a familiar story to most viewers, you know exactly what happens and even the ending, I t would've been like Mel Gibson adding an hour of story to Passion of the Christ, we know this story well, don't add on it for dramatic effect or just to add some flashy cgi effects(which didn't always work BTW) ie all those scenes with Jack Black running on that dang treadmill, eeeek!, Now for those of you wondering what Naomi was thinking, when she \\"fell in love\\" with Kong, simply explained, she met another soul that was as lonely as she was, she related, she identified with his loneliness, she did NOT want to marry Kong ! C'mon guys!
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Very nice album. It isn't like College Dropout, which is a future classic, sort of like Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt. Kanye has a different swagger on this album, and the production is great. The whole album is like an experiment, but it worked out better than Late Registration, his sophomore album. All the tracks were amazing, probably except Barry Bonds, featuring Lil Wayne. Drunk and Hot Girls is also not as great, but I'm growing on it and the sample is getting to me.    Hot album, definetly worth buying.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series has a good story line and characters that are unusual and challenging at times.  The actors do well in their roles and the plots of the various segments are different than the usual thing.  My spouse introduced me to this series and after watching the whole thing plus the movie from \\"Netflix\\" we decided to purchase the DVD's.  These DVD's should be reserved for adults as they are violent at times and have adult content which aren't good for kids.  I would hope that a second movie might be made in the future with some of the same characters.
0553573403|5.0|I was hesitant to pick this up after a recommendation from a friend being as I am not the hugest fantasy fan. I have zero interest in wizards and fireballs and white knights in shining armor. From the first 100 pages I knew this book would not be your typical fairy tale. All characters, of which there are a lot, are wonderfully fleshed out and interesting. The plot is plausible with just a hint of mysticism and there are no characters who are pure good or pure evil, they are all just human; they have their good sides and their bad sides.<br /><br />Every chapter is as engaging as the last, and before you know it you turn the final page and are looking around for the next book.<br /><br />Fantastic start to what I surmise will be a fantastic series. I am elblow deep in the second book now.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a wonderful series for the entire family. Each episode is gorgeous and the music is beautiful. David Attenborough is a wonderful narrator because of his enthusiasm. I have watched the Discovery Channel version, and Sigourney Weaver's narration is definitely not as good or enthusiastic. I highly recommend this program.
B000P12LWY|2.0|having gone to some trouble and expense to provide period costuming etc., they have the characters speaking 21st century english (complete with americanisms). what with their talk of summit meetings etc., I expected them to discuss deployment of nuclear warheads. also the gratuitous sex was entirely unnecessary (thus is serious drama reduced to soft porn). There are several good tudor dramatisations out there, don't waste your money on this one.[[ASIN:B000RF7XYY Anne of the Thousand Days / Mary, Queen of Scots]] [[ASIN:6305252564 A Man for All Seasons]] [[ASIN:B00004U3UI The Six Wives of Henry VIII - Complete Set]] [[ASIN:B00005LC1D Elizabeth R]] [[ASIN:B000BKDNX0 Masterpiece Theatre: Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen]]

B000002UDB|5.0|The Beatles' \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" the 1967 album & TV movie soundtrack that followed \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" a mere four months(!) later, can be looked at as The Son Of Sgt. Pepper. It has the exact same psychedelic feel as its' landmark predecessor, and it features two songs, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane,\\" that were recorded for \\"Pepper\\" but left off due to lack of space. In other words, it's another stunning disc from the Fab Four. So many classics on this one, including John Lennon's masterpieces \\"I Am The Walrus,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love,\\" and Paul McCartney's own set of masterworks with \\"The Fool On The Hill,\\" \\"Your Mother Should Know,\\" \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and \\"Penny Lane.\\" The title song and \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\" are both a lot of fun, as is the instrumental \\"Flying\\". And George Harrison contributes his own slice of atmospheric psychedelia with the dreamy \\"Blue Jay Way.\\" Ringo Starr doesn't sing on this album, and he has only one co-writing credit on the instrumental \\"Flying,\\" but some of his very best drumming work is right here on \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\" The musical performances are superb, and so are the tunes. And the Beatles' partner in crime, producer George Martin, does some amazing production work throughout. So what are you waiting for? Climb aboard, and enjoy the Beatles' \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\"

0316920045|5.0|I am 39, just shy of DFW's current age, and a bit older than DFW at IJ's publication. I read quite a bit and consider myself to be of significantly above average intelligence, but no authority on literature of my or any other generation. I agree that there is plenty of room for criticism of IJ and expect that many highly intelligent literary souls of all ages will find IJ tiresome and lacking in merit on many fronts. Nonetheless, IJ spoke to me as no other piece of fiction written in my lifetime. Much like the way Hunter S. Thompson's more journalistic efforts blew me away in their ability to express to me what I think about his subjects (in ways that I cannot replicate through my own experience and subsequent solitary debriefings), IJ singularly succeeds in displaying the artform of the post-modern fiction of my generation.
B000UJBYD8|2.0|I like others am adding 1 star due to the second CD which is the only part that shows real life, albeit slight.<br />The album sounds more like Holly Barbarians than the Cult.  It is certainly Cult Lite.<br />I also appreciate the fact that they put almost no information about the album inside and by that I mean no song listings or decent artwork only somebody standing with a skateboard with a shirt that possibly has a set list on it.  This seems to be some sort of punk trend probably pushed by Ian being `clever'. I don't know and am not sure I care.  One benefit however of having no song titles on the album results in me being unable to distinguish one song from the other. That fact adds to the album being even more forgettable.<br />This is by far my least favorite album, including Dreamtime, though I will admit the version of Dreamtime I have does have Resurrection Joe, and Bone Bag on it which push it over the top.  (For some reason these 2 songs are still not on the US release of Dreamtime-  oh yea record company cant afford it).<br />Had this been the first Cult album I heard, it quite possibly would have been my last.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|I couldn't agree more with the last couple of reviews.  When I listened to this cd the first time in my car I had to play it at home right away because I wasn't sure if it was my lousy car speakers or the music itself.  From a sheer sound quality, the word muddy is a perfect fit, and from a musical quality, it seems really forced, both in lyrics and instrumentally.  Many times too, it seems like they all thought they needed to be playing at the same time, which again, gave the overall sound a muddy quality.  I am a huge Bruce fan and am very disappointed in this release.  Do yourself a favor and listed to someone elses disc before you go spend your hard earned money on it.
B000URDEB0|5.0|First of all, I have all of Nightwish's albums.  Tuomas is a genius and the band complements his style perfectly.  Tarja is not on this CD and it is no hindrance.  The music is what makes the album, not just the singer and combining their sound with a full orchestra is mindblowing...kind of like Metallica's \\"S&M\\" album.  Anette's voice is initially a surprise (compared to Tarja) but after a couple of listens, she fits in beautifully.  \\"Poet and Pendulum\\" is awesome.  It's mellow, then frenetic pace and back takes you up and down on a musical roller coaster.  Wow!       All songs are Nightwish vintage...instant classics.  Enjoyed hearing Marco's toned down voice in \\"The Islander\\".  He is underused and is really versatile.  Celtic overtones in \\"The Islander\\" and \\"Last of the Wilds\\" was refreshing change of style.  All in all, you won't be disappointed, Tarja not being in it not withstanding.
B000GGSM7G|5.0|I have been a fan of this band for many years.  I have seen them live.  I own every album they did up through Wish.  And in my opinion this is the best album I have heard by them, narrowly beating out the Head on the Door.  It is the only album that I never once hit the next song button the entire way through.  It is a psychedelic freak-out.  Robert Smith's vocals sound great.  Their is abundant variety on here and it is all done fairly well.  Wherever you want to go this album will take you.  It has great rock, pop, dirge, punk and chill-out.  Part of what I always liked most about this band was that they experimented with a lot of different styles and didn't stagnate in the same thing for too long.  83-84 were a highly underrated two years for the Cure.  If you listen to Japanese Whispers and then this album back to back it is unbelievable all the stops you will make on your journey.  have fun

How can anyone not love The King.<br />This and one other are the DEFINITIVE monster on a rampage<br />movie,this is a classic not only of the HORROR film but of cinema<br />itself! Rarely has there been so convincing a fantasy creation<br />on the screen as Kong. Willis O'Brien F/X give The King charming<br />sort of life and personality sadly lacking from today's special F/X<br />Corny performances and Max Steiner's great score add to the fun!<br />Long Live The King!<br />NOTE:Also recommend Gojira/Godzilla 1954

B000S0GYRU|5.0|Dario Argento is in my opinion the MASTER of colors<br />in HORROR. Never has color looked so beautiful and<br />NEVER has Argento been so perfect.  Argento's MASTERPIECE<br />SUSPIRIA tells of the TERROR that befalls American ballet<br />student Harper when she attends the celebrated Tanz Akademie<br />at Frieberg,Germany. After several murders,a maggot infestation<br />and rumors of witchcraft(all in one movie,don't you just love it)<br />Jessica discovers that the school is a haven for a witch dubbed<br />the Black Queen. From its shocking opening double-murder to its<br />fiery finish,this is Sir Argento's finest film! Full of lush<br />colors,bizarre set design,and very loud EERIE Goblin music<br />A MUST OWN!
1401300529|5.0|This is a good book. It discusses the war in Korea with special reference to the events leading up to the war and the factors that made it the tragic draw that it was. The author sees misconceptions about the Korean war as the \\"parents\\" of the wars in Vietnam and Iraq.    The war was actually two wars. One was a war in which we defeated North Korea. The other saw the United Nations forces almost defeated by China. The United States owes its victories to its brave men and an advantage in firepower. In Korea, Vietnam and Iraq we had brave men but we were unable to fully employ our firepower advantage.    The author clearly dislikes General MacArthur whom he blames for our inability to deal with the Chinese onslaught. He is willing to grant that MacArthur was effective in World War II and was \\"a genius for a day\\" at Inchon but he concludes that the old general was past his prime and often out of touch with reality at the time of the Korean War. Another villain of the book is Ned Almond the bigoted, slipshod and sycophantic commander of the X Corps who led his troops into what could have been a terrible disaster.    The heroes of the book are General Ridgway who saved the United Nations forces and some brave and resourceful American fighting men. The author also has a good word for President Truman and most of the men around him.    The book is a good read although I would have liked to read more about the actual battles. Nevertheless, the book deserves five stars because of the insights it provides into the conditions under which the war was fought.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|Star Trek 5- the worst Star Trek film of all- sufferes from a REALLY BAD script and way too much reliance on face gags and stupid jokes. PAINFUL from begining to end. That said the actual story it self isn't that bad  and often reminds me of the hippy episode of the original series. Not a great episode mind you but if they had actually connected those stories and took a serious look at Sybok's quest and explained his relationship to \\"God\\" and Spock better it would have worked far better. At least there may have been a kind of connection to Spock having a brother (an adopted brother would have worked far better one who became fascinated with a half human Spock- anything would have been better than what we got) which came out of no where. Uhura falling for Scotty comes out of no where too. Since when did she have any interest in him? The embarrassingly stupid scene of Chekov and Sulu lost in the woods off the top should have been on the cutting room floor. The god awful dialogue between Kirk and Spock while he climbs the moutain just about get me kicking the thing across the room. Them singing Row-row-row your boat just about had me toss my drink at the movie screen when I saw it in the theatre (Doctor McCoy suggests Camp town races which again would have been the better one). A marsh melon? Is that a generic name for a marshmellow?? Although the film sucks it does have a few saving graces which are the serious moments with Sybok although few and far between they at least make it watchable. They couldn't get the special effects they wanted so they hired a third rate shop.. although they do pull off a fairly reasonable shuttle craft (which wasn't ready for the opening spot light shot) and although the barrier could have been way better it wasn't completely hopeless. Nice touch was the viewing room where Sybok works on McCoy and Spock the barrier in the window approaching was pretty good however going through it looked like a bunch of clouds. Over all the biggest problem with this film is the script which has so many errors in it that even a rainy day fan could spot half of them. Did they even watch the other films?? Strictly for those wanting the whole collection.

0810993139|5.0|My 8 year old son bought this book from his school book fair after seeing it in the handout.  It was a very popular book this year.  When my son got his there were only 2 books left.  So he bought it and he LOVED it!!  He read it in about 3 days.  He has never read a book of this size (200+ pages) on his own.  He read it on the bus and came home and read it on the couch with NO TV!!!  Then he read it to go to sleep.  It was so cute to hear him laugh out loud while he was reading.  Now he wants more Wimpy Kid books.  I hope they keep 'em coming.  Thanks for reading my post.
0783229526|5.0|Anyone who doesn't understand this movie either needs to watch it again to try understanding it or go back to the cartoons they watch on an everyday basis. This movie is by far my favourite Johnny Depp movie!<br /><br />His portrayal is spot on and he just does such a great job in all the scenes he's in. Del Torro did a damn good job too, both actors getting the essence of the book and the time period just right. There are so many funny lines in here that you can quote them and people will know where they came from. It never stops being funny, actually getting funnier the more I watch it.<br /><br />Why can't more movies be like this? Both smart and hilarious. It's a rare thing in movie cinema today. More writers and directors need to look to this movie for inspiration.
074325144X|3.0|I bought this book to improve my running form and especially my pace.  This book introduces a person to being aware of your body mechanics while running. To me, many of the tips were common sense, such as keeping a straight posture and not swinging my arms wildly or crossing them in front of me.  I probably wasn't leaning forward as much as I am now.  I probably had more of an up and down stride, so that tip was helpful (although I'm still not any faster).  The one tip that \\"did me in\\" was the tip to land mid-foot.  I had always read and learned to land heel to toe.  After about 2 months of landing mid-foot, I was puzzled and frustrated as to why I started to have extremely painful knees.  Especially walking up and down stairs.  I couldn't figure out why this was happening.  It got to the point where I dreaded my run and every step I was saying ouch, ouch, ouch.  Then I thought, I think I'll stride the way I used to stride and within 1 day the pain was gone.  I am now back to a heel toe landing and wanted to warn other people who have read this book.  I'm not saying the advice in the book is all bad, but you also need to listen to your own unique body.

0743486285|5.0|This book is great read for any music fan.  It's a personal document and record, for the lack of guidance that most musicians face in todays recording industry.  The hangers on don't want to tell the golden goose No! So they let them kill themselves form over indulgence.  At least Nikki had the voice of reason, thou clouded by tons of drugs and alcohol, try to ask \\"what am I doing to myself\\".  It's kind of like accident you can't look away from.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I admit I was a latecomer to the Firefly and Serenity movement, but it does not dim my love for all things in that 'verse now. I also admit to a fine hankerin' for all things Nathan Fillion, and this here will do me jus fine. Any excuse to see the movie again is perfect with me, but seriously, the extras on the second disc made this a \\"must have\\" for my collection. If you, as I, feel that 13 episodes were simply not enough and you yearn for more information than those simple few can give you, than this is the perfect addition. The \\"never before seen footage\\" was a thrill; I truly enjoyed every overblown, choreographed, gaffed, giggled, serious and heartstrung moment. Also, a cute little flyer came in the box with mine for \\"Ships Papers\\", \\"Alliance Money\\" and a few other collector items for sale, for those who are truly dedicated to keeping the Firefly mystique alive. The box itself is quite a bit more hardy, and beautiful in a way, and its outer raised embossing is pleasing to the touch. I am very pleased to have this version in my personal collection as well as the original, but if I had to choose just one, I'd go for this one.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Remake of old movie with good special effects.  Worth your time/money if you're into time travel or SciFi flicks.
0743298020|4.0|This is the kind of gothic, convoluted tale to curl up with on a rainy night.  Eerie but confusing themes move slowly past your window and if you are a little feverish they may even make sense.  It's a hard book to rush through (notice the terse, irritated reviews here) but I found it pleasurable and suspensful if you don't ask too much or think too hard.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|I first learned about Manu Chao in 2001 with his Proxima Estacion: Esperanza release and I have thoroughly enjoyed that album and the prior release, Clandestino.  I couldn't get enough of the man and gave a listen to his old group Mano Negra, but I wasn't able to get into the band.  That little intro was meant to give you an idea of where I'm coming from...I'm not a HUGE fan but I do love the guy's music (enough to buy a few copies to give to friends).    After such a protracted wait the album would have to be pretty good in order to live up to my expectations.  La Radiolina does not disappoint!  What can I say other than, \\"I love it!\\"  The prior two albums were obviously very similar to one another but this effort reflects a different point of view; it still does, however, display the same contagious rhythms and depth for which I had hoped.  I'm not much for putting political views into arts, but I understand why artists seem compelled to do so.  This album is not overtly aggressive in it's stance, so I'm still able to enjoy the lyrics (at least those lyrics I can understand).
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Blackbird is an amazing record from start to finish.  3 years was a long wait but this record is amazing and I when I listen to it I don't hear any resemblance to Creed whatsoever.  This record is the heaviest record they have ever released as a band and I'm glad that Creed broke up now they can finally show off there true talent.  I always thought of Creed as just another mediocre alternative rock band until I heard the debut album ODR and thought it was great and couldn't stop listening to it.  I just hope this is a warm up tour I would love to see these guys for a fourth time with new material.  If you're expecting another ODR be prepared to be blown away with the new record because it sounds nothing like it but not in a disappointing way this is the best sophomore effort I have heard in a long time.
0805079831|5.0|Crisis theology was in vogue during my seminary days, stimulated by the popularity of neo-orthodoxy during those days.  This book takes crisis logic to a different level, associating it with economics and warfare.
B000001DU5|4.0|In my mind, there are certain bands or singers who define a decade, or who might be considered the best musical examples of the time. For me, Tears for Fears is a great example and one of the bigger and more successful acts of the 80s. Tears for Fears, of course, is no longer making new music, but you can't get away from hearing them on the radio or in the mall or at Taco Bell or wherever. This compilation is one of the best the 80s had to offer, although I was always a little surprised at their huge popularity since their music rarely had a danceable beat.  But what it did have was a great sound and commercial appeal that still exists today, even if the lyrics were strangely melancholy for pop music. I was never a die-hard fan at the time but I loved most of their hits like \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World,\\" \\"Shout,\\" and \\"Head Over Heels.\\" I had never heard \\"Woman In Chains\\" before buying the CD but it quickly became my favorite. \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\" gets a little old sometimes for me, and I'm not especially fond of \\"I Believe,\\" but they're still worth listening to. Personally, I was always partial to their older and more New Wave-ish sound, like \\"Mad World\\" and \\"Pale Shelter,\\" and I'm probably the only person in the world who was disappointed that \\"The Way You Are\\" wasn't included (apparently the band hated that song?!?), but I can't find a single song here that I absolutely *don't* like or would regularly skip. My only complaint is that the songs don't appear to be in chronological order which is a bit confusing, but it's not that big of a deal. Overall, a must-have for fans of 80s music.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is the best series program since tales from the crypt on HBO! If you like dark style shows, pick this up!!
0689853491|2.0|I loved this book and song as a child...so I thought that I would get it for my little one. Well it came and the pages are in reverse order and upside down...oh well.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This is a beautiful film - well made, well acted, and imaginative.  Young Ouimet's character testifies to the integrity of the game viewed against the arrogance of the upper class and the hopelessness of his father.   The golf swings are realistic and the drama superb.
0060989157|5.0|If you are a Motley Crue fan or just a rock n roll fan in general, this book is a definite read for you.  I read it in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down it was that good.  I thought the most interesting person in the book was Nikki Sixx (wow, the things he went through in his life will amaze you that he IS still alive).  Read the book, I don't think you will be disappointed.  Great read!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is a wonderful story.  Most people of this generation have seen The Simpsons's episode \\"Rosebud\\" ([[ASIN:B00020SLO0 The Simpsons - The Complete Fifth Season]]), and heard the ending just about every time the movie is mentioned, but this movie does a great job of holding your attention.<br /><br />There's a reason it's such a celebrated movie.  It is absolutely wonderful.  Kane's story is one that may not leave you breathless as some other more popular movies, but, just as [[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)]], it builds an aura in itself that you must check out.<br /><br />Is it the best movie ever made?  That's highly debatable.  I wasn't as captivated as watching [[ASIN:0783226055 Vertigo (Collector's Edition)]] or [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], and I may not have been as entertained as watching [[ASIN:B00005JLV6 The Rules of the Game - Criterion Collection]] or [[ASIN:B000FSME1A Apocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]] but there is something about this movie.  One that leaves you visually impressed as well as intellectually satisfied.  It's not as fast paced as the movies of this generation but it will hold your attention to the end.<br /><br />This 60th edition two disc set includes two commetaries, one from reknowned director Peter Bogdanovich, and one from reknowned critic Roger Ebert.  Roger Ebert's commentary is the better of the two.  He sure knows a lot about films.  Other than a threatrical trailer there's nothing else to the first disc.  The second disc features the 1990's production \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\" almost as long and entertaining as the movie itself.<br /><br />Definite Must Buy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|During its brief stint on broadcast TV, I managed to catch only a few episodes of Firefly, but I never really got into it.  Probably because, like many of the best TV dramas, Firefly is a highly linear show.  If you skip episodes or watch them out of order, you just don't get it.  But I had heard from friends that the show was good, so I decided to buy it, and it did not disappoint.  Once you start watching, it's hard to put the discs down.  And make sure to watch Serenity when you're done with the season.
B000002A33|4.0|I do enjoy the Screaming Trees.  They are unheard of to many people, and most people think that im coming up with something from an LSD high... but it does have good songs on it.  The first four didnt captivate me much as anything that i heard from them previous to buying this CD, the first one ive bought from them, but i do listen to it often.
B000N3SS80|5.0|This album takes Lopez away from her dance/pop/rnb sound. This album is full of beautiful ballads. The lyrics are amazing and she definitely delivers her strongest vocals ever on this CD.
1582701709|5.0|This is an eye opener...a must read.  I find myself referring back to the book to absorb as much as I can.  Who would have known?  Get this one for your library, it's a wonderful investment!
B000P0J024|5.0|I've been waiting for over two years for this CD to be re-issued, I am thrilled.  Thank you.
B000RGSOR8|5.0|In a year where I was lucky enough to visit several great art museums across the U.S., I can say the most effective piece of art I experienced was St. Vincent. Coincidentally, it's also my favorite \\"pop\\" album of the year.<br /><br />These songs deserve more than a quick preview on iTunes; St. Vincent may take a few minutes of adjustment, since Annie Clark's work is strange and quirky... but it's also accessible and luminously gorgeous. One might accuse her of throwing \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" into her song structures -- her songs are simply packed with ideas -- but the result is as messy, beautiful, perfect and sublime as life should be. There are few pleasures available this year that match the choruses of \\"All My Stars Aligned\\" and \\"Apocalypse Song\\", the cinematic swells of \\"Landmindes\\", and the moment when the drums return in \\"Your Lips are Red\\"  - which still makes me lightheaded after dozens of listens.<br /><br />My advice? Get this collection, give it a chance, and SEE THIS ARTIST LIVE for a simply jaw-dropping experience. This is one of the great debuts, and Annie Clark's slight frame and delicate voice contain a talent that is, in a word, towering -  and I don't state that lightly. In a perfect world, \\"Marry Me\\" would be hailed as a milestone moment in popular culture. This is a stunning debut.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|this is a great action movie done in a very stylized black and white fasion. it's well worth the viewing.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Mellow and melodic... such enjoyable music that can be listened to over and over... and over.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies of our time. its the story of a slacker who is trying to cope with the craziness around him. lots of swearing, if you object to that sort of thing.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is a milestone of rock music. This is one of the best LP (or CD) of all time. Music as well as lyrics is simply fantastic. And this new SACD sound brings long forgotten quadrophonic version of the album back to your ears. For better sound some drums and bass guitars had been recorded anew.
B000W9MMPU|4.0|Ocean's Eleven is a fantastic film and the two follow on are still a good time, although not the same quality as the first.  The second is by far the weakest and takes the most liberties with being ridiculous.  You do have to suspend disbelief in these films but it is totally insane to say they are a bad trilogy especially when the first is genius.  Not to mention that the original is actually pretty crappy if you go back and watch it.  Just because it is a classic doesn't make it good.  If you look at the original Thomas Crown it is actually quite bad.  The remake was a fun, very well done film.  Clearly the previous reviewer has an axe to grind and that is making it into their review.  If the extras are anything like extras on the non-HD versions, you'll be pleased.  Rarely have I appreciated a commentary but they have some great ones on these discs.
B000TJQ75O|5.0|this CD includes all of natalie's singles. natalie is certainly multitalented! she acts well and sings good! the songs are great, mostly with an upbeat tune. i love all the songs here. the lead single here is \\"glorious\\".
B000N5F6PG|5.0|This movie has turned out to be one of my alltime favorite movies.The lead character who is ably played by Patrick Swayse is shot and killed by<br />an apparent robber. He is in the company of his lover played by Demi<br />Moore. Now dead Swayse becomes a ghost. He begins watching and guarding<br />over his lady love Moore. In his ghostly form he sees the forces of evil<br />who are responsible for his murder moving in on Demi Moore. The chief<br />perpetrator is a character named Carl. He hired a contract killer to kill<br />our hero Swayse. Swayse has to warn his lover what Carl is up to. To do<br />this he uses the services of a con lady fortune teller played by Whoopi<br />Goldberg. Goldberg plays this role to the nth degree. She literally steals<br />the show. Her attempts to convince Moore that she is speaking for Swayse<br />is equally humorous. The movie is entertaining to the end. The method that Carl gets his is equally satisfying. This is a great movie with great actors and an excellent plot. Do not miss this movie.
0316067598|3.0|I respect Luttrell and what he did, I don't respect the fact that he has used his story, in part, to push an obvious agenda.      I spent a year in Eastern Afghanistan as an infantryman and have been on OPs (observations posts) that were compromised.  In Afghanistan it's virtually impossible not to be compromised.  In these instances, murdering (I am not going to mesh words by calling it anything else) Afghani civilians was never an option.  There are legitimate concerns about the ROE (rules of engagement), but this is not one of them.  In no way is it ever permissible to shoot unarmed civilians based upon the assumption that they might bring harm upon you later on.  Contrary to some people's perception, combat is not an \\"anything goes\\" environment where soldiers can shoot first and ask questions later.  Nor should it be.  The ROE exists for a specific reason, and it has nothing to do political correctness.  I'll spare anyone a lecture about the more subtle points of counterinsurgency tactics; but if anyone is curious about why we have a ROE, they should read General Petraeus' (remember him?) book, which makes the best and most articulate case for the ROE.      I am not sure why Luttrell chose to blame a political ideology for what happened to his team, but I was disappointed that he would claim that, if but for the liberals, it would ever be morally or legally acceptable to shoot unarmed civilians.  The fact that the Afghans most likely went on to compromise their position is simply a hard fact of fighting an insurgency.  Luttrell surely was aware of this when he volunteered to join a high speed unit that was created to operate in exactly these circumstances, and I'd be surprised if the SEALs had not planned for this exact contingency in depth.  As an infantry scout, I know we considered, planned, and rehearsed actions upon contact and actions upon soft compromise.      To the inevitable flames that will be incoming, I'll say that I usually don't believe in secondguessing the actions of the people in the field.  However, Luttrell chose to publish his story and was paid to do so.  That puts this manner in the public square and opens the issue up for discussion.  Thus, while I respect Luttrell, I found the book to be a bit heavy handed for my taste.  I would have personally enjoyed it more if Luttrell would have simply told his story with less bluster and political commentary.
B000002UAX|3.0|Heres the thing - obviously this is some great psychedelic rock music, but I must say that I found it very hard to listen to this double-album once I became acquainted with the fact that the Charles Manson murderers listened to this for their inspiration and even constructed their killing spree around certain track titles from this album.<br /><br />I don't know about you - but when a bunch of cold-blooded psychopathic killers can sit around and get 'inspired' by one album and then commit mass murder (if you haven't heard about the infamous Sharon Tate murders committed by the 'Manson Family' in the late 1960s, please check the Net for data), then I'm sorry, I can't listen to the record with a straight face.<br /><br />I know its all associative, but still, the beauty of this record diminished the day I learnt it inspired the murder of an eight-month pregnant woman. I just cant listen to this album again - it won't be the same.
0060763280|5.0|This is a very valuable book, talking about \\"Universal Laws\\" mixed with a very  down to earth approach and easy to do excercises. Straight forward language (easy to understand also for foreigners like me). I read a lot of good books, this one is certainly one of the best in the erea of Wealth building.  Catherine, Switzerland

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wish this series was presented on TV in it's logical order.  Even the dumbed-down public would have fallen in love with it then.     If you want to see a series with awesome character development AND dialog & plot rather than mindless special effects I cannot recommend this series enough.  You will certainly watch it over and over again.  Be warned, it WILL leave you wanting more and wishing the series was extended.      It's simply that good.
0618680004|5.0|Often funny, always honest, and damn hard to refute.  Thank you, Mr. Dawkins, for stating in so enjoyable a form what still, alas, takes courage to publicly say.
0061001783|5.0|This is the first Heyer book I have read and I couldn't put it down.  It was a little more difficult for me to read and required more concentration because I'm more accustomed to Barbara Cartland's style of writing (a favorite of mine for over 16 years), however it was an entrancing book filled with wonderful characters.  I greatly look forward to reading \\"Cotillion\\" again soon and also indulging in Heyer's other works as soon as I can.
0618680004|5.0|Absolutely excellent.  A must read for those of strong faith , agnostics and atheists.  This treatise will help you set yourself free of the yoke of early childhood indoctrination that foists upon us a fairytale of religious faith.  This is a thorough exploration of the rationale for and against the concept of a supreme entity - god.
1592289444|5.0|I am an avid reader, and this is by far one of the most fascinating books I have read.  It shows the strength and willpower of a human's will to survive in the most horrific condtions.  A must read.
0440238609|1.0|I am an avid reader, and I love fantasy and children's literature, but what is up with everyone loving these books?  I was looking forward to reading The Golden Compass, only to be completely disapointed within a few pages of starting it.  I found it to be almost disturbing in its weirdness, and I honestly do not know a child, even an older well-read child, that would be able to read these books without confusion and with a genuine interest in finishing the trilogy. I managed to finish the first book, but had no interest in pursuing the trilogy further, and I was honestly left with a bad vibe from having read The Golden Compass. After reading the comments from the author about his purpose for writing the book, I can understand why I do not like it.  What happened to writing children's books with the intent to entertain children with harmless, light-heartedness?  I will stick with Harry Potter and Chronicles of Narnia thank you!!!
B000V8I2QU|3.0|I should say that if you like Bruce, you will like this album. To me this is not a great album, just OK. Mostly, I can't get over the terrible mix. It is muddy, almost noisy and sounds and feels pieced together. I can't believe a record with his budget was released this way. Maybe it's all they had to work with. As a band, Bruce and the E-Street Band have never sounded tight to me, but that was part of their allure; gritty music. This record is just too gritty. Listen in headphones and you'll hear it what I'm talking about.
B00005JLCI|5.0|This is without question the definitive version of Hamlet on film.  The language is exquisitely performed, conversational and at the same moment lyrical and dramatic..the acting is uniformly exceptional (with only a few minor sour notes...Jack Lemmopn seems miscast, for instance). The direction is solid and athletic, the pacing brisk, the text complete.  This baby clocks in at a little over 3 hours and it's worth every second of your time to rediscover (or discover for the first time) what a first rate cast and a brilliant Shakesperean interpreter can accomplish with the greatest English language play ever written.  I cannot recommend this film enough.  Ps. While you are investingating this one, buy Henry V, too.  Also brilliant!!
B000RMQH30|4.0|First, the knocks on this disc will be that it doesnt necessarily break new ground for BH and that sometimes his songs sound like they could be from Motown, the Stones, or Black Crowes.  I get it and understand.    That being said, go out and get this disc!  Once you know that story of how it was recorded, you will marvel at just how tight and polished this disc sounds.  BH and the Criminals make this album sound like it is a collection of standards, and by that I mean classics!    My favorite songs are Needed You Tonight (I LOVE crankin' this on the car stereo) and Heart of Matters.  For a taste of what makes BH special as a musician, check out Paris Sunrise #7, a 5 minute solo acoustic guitar instrumental.  I like the variation in styles in the middle of the album with alternating slower songs with upbeat songs    As a sidenote, I was in the deep South for an interview when they played this disc at the restaurant.  I felt happy, peppy, and at ease and that is the effect this disc can have on you.    I kind of compare it to another disc I bought recently in Lyle Lovett's new one \\"It's Not Big It's Large.\\"  Neither one really breaks new ground or turns the music world upside down, but both are extremely well crafted discs you can listen to from beginning to end with very high replay value, perfect for either the long commute or sippin' sweet tea on the back porch.  And for godssake if you get a chance to see either of them live, run do not walk to the nearest venue!!
B00005JLCI|4.0|I'm no literary or film scholar so I can't speak to Branagh's directing or acting. However, I do know I love this film. The sets are beautiful and grand, the costumes are modern and the acting is dramatic and captivating.    There are only two or three cons to this film:    1. The movie is *long*. At four hours you'll be reaching for a second bag of popcorn or a third drink by the time it's over, but ultimately worth it.    2. The film is split into two discs, so the first disc at around 3 hours ends in an intermission and the fourth disc continues where the old one left off. I believe the second disc does a short re-cap so you can continue this a second night if you want, but I would just block off the whole amount of time and watch it in one go.    3. The movie itself can jump from theme to theme while the camera stays mostly in place and the viewer is left to their interpretation of the Bard's olde english to follow the story. If you're not familiar with Hamlet already you might get left behind in the dialogue (though it is quick there is a _lot_ of it). On the whole there is very little \\"action\\" in this film, it's more made up of speeches, contemplations and set-up.    These things considered, I have to say this is my favorite production of Hamlet. Kenneth's portrayal is awe-inspiring and never falters. The other actors all do a fabulous job and the movie just looks beautiful (shot in 70mm!). I really wish I had a high-definition plasma or LCD TV to enjoy it with, but it looked beautiful nonetheless on my 32\\" tube TV.    If you're a fan of Shakespeare, go buy this movie and throw out all your other Hamlet knock-offs.
B00004U45G|5.0|I was lucky enough to be present at the show this cd is a recording of. All I can say is that I am so glad they made it because it gets better every time i listen to it - and I certainly don't remember evry last detail from the show so it was very considerate of Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes to record this!    The Black Crowes show here they are one of the most underrated rock n roll bands EVER. Chris Robinson is way more than credible filling in for Robert Plant on the Zeppelin numbers and he meshes naturally with Page on the covers and Crowes songs. I expected him to be good and Page is in fine form flawlessly recreating the Zeppelin glory, and showing true musicianship on the blues covers included here. Page is really deserving of his accolades. But once again I expected that.    What I hear every time I listen that I DIDN't expect is how excellent and downright righteous the band is. These guys can just flat out play and they are to me on a level with the E Street Band for their musical versatility, funkiness, and rock solid renditions of old and new material. I don't know about you, but as a guitarist myself, I would never want to solo AFTER Jimmy Page, and Rich Robinson steps up to the plate and delivers on this count. The whole band does. I love this collection, probably more because I was there, but if you like ROCK music you will love this too. It's great.
B000OY8NII|5.0|OH my goodness how I love this series.  I cannot wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD.  One of two shows I make sure Im in front of the TV for!!! That is saying alot for a fulltime college student, parttime working, & single mother of three children ranging from 18 to 7.  Yall this show is excellent if you are even interested a little in the premiss you should watch it A+ entertainment in my  book.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I bought this anthology to replace my old VHS collection.  Of course, the quality of both video and audio are better, but the big plus is the 2nd disc for each movie giving hours of background stories and featurettes.
1400079179|1.0|This book could have been a fantastic read, but I was so disappointed in it, I almost didn't even finish it!  The beginning was exciting, I couldn't put it down- however, by 2/3 of the way through, it was just mindless, predictable garbage. I wasn't expecting this \\"historical\\" novel to be factual, but it was still a disappointment.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|I seldom give 5 star reviews so the 4.3 is a great rating!<br /><br />Mark T has one of the best guitar styles around. He shreds but also has the ability to let the melodies crawl under your skin. He did it in Creed and now Alter Bridge is 2 for 2 in terms of quality releases.<br /><br />Though he doesnt get ALL the credit here. The foundation (bass and drums) are very well done and Vocally i think that Myles K has added a great element here. A much more 'comfortable' performance on this CD. Excellent band that has now come together. Hopefully they will STAY together for a long time to come.<br /><br />The tracks speak for themselves. From the blazing opener 'Ties That bind'(awesome track) and heavy 'White Knuckles' to the original sounding (and lyrically excellent) 'Break Me Down' and 'Rise Today' to the more (Dare i say) Creed-esque 'Brand New Start' and 'Before tomorrow Comes', the tunes are great. The soloing (of course) is stellar and lyrically it is just as inspiring as their debut. (which i thought was one of 2004's best).<br /><br />I am really happy with this CD and believe that the band has what it takes to make it for the long haul. They may never get close to being as big as Creed was, but the music is there. Quality wise it is a slam dunk! i thank them for staying true to their style and staying POSITIVE! Which is hard to find in the current state of music. It definately doesnt hurt to read the lyrics. They are great and not preachy by any means.<br /><br />For Purchasers : Amazon is a great value, but there are 2 additional tracks on the best Buy version that are excellent as well. Something to think about..
B000JSI7AI|5.0|I've added to and slightly revised this review, and appended comments about the Blu-ray edition.<br /><br />I've waited almost two years to review this film: it took me that long to work up the courage to watch \\"Crash\\", the viewing of which seemed a prerequisite for my claiming any degree of objectivity or intellectual honesty in reviewing \\"Brokeback\\". (I've posted a review of that film, as well.) I also wanted to be certain I'd found the right things to say and the right way to say them. There are so many things to discuss about \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" they could fill a book. Hopefully, someone will write one (qv, Jerome Agel's \\"The Making of Kubrick's 2001\\", a fine book about another controversial film).<br /><br />Of all the reviews, pro or con, the most-significant came from World Net Daily, an ultra-far-right religious publication. You'd expect its \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" review to be titled something like \\"Hollywood Liberals Aggressively Promote Homosexual Agenda\\". But, no -- it's \\"Rape of the Marlboro Man\\". (Yes!) The review argues that homosexuals are trying to appropriate the upright, decent, manly image of the cowboy to encourage acceptance of their own debased/depraved/perverted views of manhood.<br /><br />One doesn't have to know much Western history to recognize that the traditional view of the cowboy as \\"the man on the white horse\\" doesn't bear close examination. Cowboys were rough-living men who drank, gambled, and whored with little restraint.<br /><br />Cowboys and other Westerners were often solitary men - that's always been part of their mystique. (See \\"The Myth of the American Superhero\\" by Lawrence & Jewett.) Many left the East to get away from society, from government, from social pressures (including those to marry). From \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" to \\"Lonesome Dove\\", frontiersmen have been laconic loners. (Well... Gus McCrae isn't exactly laconic. But Woodrow F Call makes up for it.)<br /><br />Cowboys and other western pioneers lived in an overwhelmingly homosocial environment. Whores provided a convenient sexual outlet, whereas marriage brought with it social fetters. Men therefore looked to other men for companionship -- and sometimes other things.<br /><br />The emotionally intimate relationships of Western males has been written about for a century and a half. Mark Twain observed homosexual behavior among prospectors. Charles Badger Clark's \\"The Lost Pardner\\", one of the all-time most-popular cowboy poems, outlines the near-sexual -- and explicitly misogynistic * -- relationship of two wranglers. Yet heterosexual males read it without embarrassment -- or seeming awareness of the poem's implications -- because the truth it speaks about intense male friendships likely masks its truth about male sexuality. Clark's \\"Bachin'\\" extols the delights of a female-free life (\\"...in our trouble list we never count a wife\\"). Its opening line -- \\"Our ways are hid; our trails are strange\\" -- and the later \\"Each has a reason why he's lone, but keeps it 'neath his hat\\" ares suggestive. Clark's less-familiar poem \\"My Enemy\\" ends with the adversaries not only making up, but also apparently making out. The implication is subtle, but Clark's writing shows such a consistently careful choice of words that it's difficult to read the meaning of \\"and when dark found us limp and jaded\\" otherwise.<br /><br />Several Bret Harte stories express a startling homoeroticism. The men of \\"Tennessee's Partner\\" and \\"In the Tules\\" share a love for each other that's \\"consummated\\" only in the afterlife. The implied \\"marriage\\" of Tennessee and his male partner did not prevent this story from becoming one of Harte's most-popular, probably because it was written toward the end of an era when it was not uncommon for men to express effusive love for each other, and the Romantic fancy of lovers uniting in death had not yet faded. \\"Tennessee's Partner\\" is a fine example of hiding something in plain sight.<br /><br />If \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" deviates from our view of the West, that view is the view presented by Hollywood and TV -- not the view of the people who actually lived and worked in the West. You cannot truly \\"rape\\" (in any sense of the word) someone or something that never existed.<br /><br />The inconvenient truths are... Men like sex. When women aren't around (and sometimes when they are), they'll have it with each other. And -- yes -- even unerringly masculine men will engage in mutual sodomy (as Jack and Ennis do), however unbelievable that might seem to heterosexual males reading this. (I speak from direct experience.) \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a gut punch to the American view of what constitutes \\"masculinity\\", which is why it attracted the outrage of groups and people that might otherwise ignore films with homosexual characters or themes.<br /><br />Those who'd like to investigate this subject in greater depth should read \\"Queer Cowboys\\" by Chris Packard and \\"Male-Male Intimacy in Early America\\" by William Benemann.<br /><br />Larry McMurtry has famously said \\"the story was just sitting there, waiting to be told\\". (For a writer notorious for demythologizing the West, why hadn't _he_ told it? **) Yet it /has/ been told, many times. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" doesn't stand in isolation, but is firmly in the tradition of stories about frontiersmen sharing marriage-like relationships with indigenous males or other frontiersmen. *** \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is simply the first time a serious writer has told that story without ignoring or \\"coding\\" its sexual elements. ****<br /><br />Larry McMurtry bragged about using virtually all the dialog from the short story. This is not true. Some significant material was removed, such as Ennis telling Jack of the overwhelming sexual attraction he feels for him, and Jack's telling Ennis why he finds sodomy with him so pleasurable. (I asked a bisexual horseman whether Jack's understanding of the physiology involved was correct, and he said it was.)<br /><br />McMurtry's novels don't shy away from sex, but he isn't interested in graphic depictions, and \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"'s film treatment reflects this. As late as a year before filming began, the screenplay had the camera coyly averting its eye as Ennis mounted Jack.<br /><br />But McMurtry doesn't limit himself to avoiding graphic sex -- he tries to de-sexualize the story. Though Annie Proulx describes Jack and Ennis as engaging in hot, sweaty sex up on Brokeback, the film shows them only briefly rolling around -- and that through Aguirre's binoculars. More significantly, the screenplay omits an important moment in their final tryst -- Jack putting his hand between Ennis's thighs to warm it, while Ennis unbuttons Jack's shirt.<br /><br />These omissions support the only valid criticism of the film -- it's overly reserved. Its basic reserve is a good thing -- the story easily lends itself to overwrought melodrama. Had the direction or acting been not so restrained, the effect would have been ludicrous, and \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" would have died a quick and unlamented death.<br /><br />But the restraint is excessive. The film fails to fully show what the short story makes clear -- 20 years haven't dimmed Ennis and Jack's crude lust for each other. We need to see them, on that final camping trip, pulling each other's clothes off and wrestling in front of the fire, kissing each other as violently as they had in front of Ennis's apartment. This scene would make their final argument and Ennis's ultimate acknowledgement of their mutual love all the more poignant and pathetic (in the good sense).<br /><br />As fine as Ang Lee's direction is (it's equivalent to walking on snow without leaving footprints), Peter Bogdanovich might have been a bit less \\"arty\\" and might have better caught the intensity of Ennis and Jack's relationship, without stepping over the line into melodrama. (Think of the pool-table scene in \\"The Last Picture Show\\".) And in the fantasy world of \\"if only\\", imagine the same script and actors directed by Alfred Hitchcock, with a Bernard Herrmann score. (Before you protest, note that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is, thematically, very much a Hitchcock story.)<br /><br />The religious right would like people to believe movie reviewers are a liberal lot consciously promoting \\"the homosexual agenda\\", and that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" provided the perfect opportunity. Rubbish. Reviewers -- even those as intellectually shallow and confused as Michael Medved -- recognized a great film when they saw it. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" speaks a truth many people want to suppress -- men become emotionally involved with each other, and have sex with each other, just as men and women do.<br /><br />Indeed -- and I emphasize this point to any uncomfortable hetereo males who've read this far -- men can and do have intense emotional relationships with each other /without/ sexual desire. I've had such relationships with hetero men, and know there are many straight guys out there who want emotional -- though not sexual -- intimacy with other men. Unfortunately, they often have to go to queer men for it, because most hetero men are just too cowardly.<br /><br />But is \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" _truly_ a great film? Well, it's an /iconic film -- as iconic as 2001, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Casablanca, Chinatown, Citizen Kane, King Kong, Network (another Best Picture loser), The Maltese Falcon, Snow White, or The Wizard of Oz. Great films aren't necessarily iconic -- but an iconic film is, by definition, great. *****<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" has also entered pop culture, perhaps indelibly, even among people who haven't seen the film. When a female reporter used \\"Brokeback\\" references in a piece about Vladimir Putin's bare-chested fishing expedition, few there were who didn't get the joke. And \\"I wish I knew how to quit you\\" is likely to become a lasting catch phrase, just as \\"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn\\" and \\"I'm shocked... shocked!\\" have.<br /><br />So why did \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" lose Best Picture? If Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine hadn't opened their stupid traps, the answer might have remained equivocal. But it seems that \\"Crash\\" -- a film with mixed reviews that appeared on few best-picture lists -- was nominated to provide an alternative for those who had personal (rather than artistic) reasons for rejecting \\"Brokeback Mountain\\".<br /><br />Tony Curtis (nee, Bernard Schwartz) -- who has unapologetically admitted to having sex with men (see the Wikipedia bio) -- should have _some_ feeling for what it means to belong to a discriminated-against minority. Both he and Mr. Borgnine have worked with gay men and women (on both sides of the camera), and ought to have the common sense to realize that attacking \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" -- on other than artistic grounds -- was a slap in the face to their queer colleagues. ****** Despite Mr. Borgnine's averral that John Wayne would not have tolerated \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", I suspect \\"The Duke\\" -- assuming the film truly did offend him -- would simply have kept his mouth shut (at least in public).<br /><br />An anti-parallel could be drawn with the 1947 Best-Picture winner, \\"Gentleman's Agreement\\", an intelligent film about anti-Semitism, though hardly of the quality justifying a Best-Picture nomination, let alone a win. But Hollywood's demographic is strongly Jewish, so it's not surprising it was nominated and won, simply because it corresponded with the interests of that demographic. ******* Imagine the reaction if a gentile actor had said he'd no intention of seeing the film because of its subject matter!<br /><br />\\"Hollywood\\" had the opportunity to award \\"Best Picture\\" to a film that truly deserved the honor, if only because it disrupted the usual order of things, and did it so well. As a resepcted LA reviewer remarked the day following the ceremony, Hollywood had finally demonstrated (if any proof were needed) that the Academy Awards were meaningless.<br /><br />Is the Story Plausible?<br/>-----------------------<br /><br />It's significant that no one -- not even the most rabidly anti-gay fundamentalists -- has raised any objection to \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"'s plausibility. Of course, fundamentalists /wouldn't/ object, as it would contradict their assertion that homosexual behavior is a consciously chosen perversion. The seeming naturalness of Ennis and Jack's attraction is arguably the most-disturbing thing about the story.<br /><br />Ennis and Jack's tale is completely plausible. People who think \\"real men\\" don't have sex with each other -- or God forbid -- kiss each other, or fall in love, don't know much about what goes on in the world. I've known queer men who would beat John Wayne in a butch-off and could cold-cock The Duke in a fair fight.<br /><br />An appreciation for the male physique -- which is only one step removed from sexual attraction -- is hardly uncommon among heterosexual males. (Heterosexual men engage in bodybuilding primarily to improve their looks, not their health.) I saw it in my 100%-hetero father's reaction to Douglas Fairbanks' (lack of) costume in \\"The Thief of Bagdhad\\". And highly sexed hetero males sometimes experiment with homosexual behavior. (I was publicly out in college, and two notoriously womanizing male acquaintances came on to me simply because they were curious.)<br /><br />Men are sometimes confused about their sexual orientation. I've met hetero men who told me they were afraid of waking up one morning and discovering they were queer. They likely had sexual feelings for other men they didn't understand or know how to handle.<br /><br />Ennis and Jack's mutual attraction is a normal thing, and doesn't need an explanation, any more than Rhett and Scarlett's does. And Scarlett's interest in Rhett is unabashedly sexual, but no one sees much wrong in that. (\\"He was a tall man and powerfully built. Scarlett thought she had never seen a man with such wide shoulders, so heavy with muscles, almost too heavy for gentility. ...his eyes were as bold and black as any pirate's appraising a galleon to be scuttled or a maiden to be ravished.\\") Which should be no surprise to anybody.<br /><br />Watching the film for a fifth or sixth time, on Blu-ray, I remain impressed with Michelle Williams's heartbreaking performance (particularly the short scene where Ennis cruelly dismisses their marriage, and she tells him what she's finally figured out), and the scene in which Jack's mother asks Ennis to come back. She wants to spend time with someone who truly loved her son -- which her appallingly nasty husband never did.<br /><br />Comments on the Music<br />---------------------<br /><br />I was surprised at \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" winning Best Score, as there is so _little_ score. Yet, it is the _lack_ of scoring that contributes so much to \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"'s dramatic punch -- it would be nowhere as good a film if it had a full score. It's probably the first film score to win an Oscar because of its non-existence.<br /><br />Bernard Herrmann famously said that the purpose of music is to establish an emotional connection between what's going on up on the screen and the audience -- the composer had to fill in what  the director could not or would not show. Herrmann was a master of film music because he focused on what was /not/ being said or shown. An outstanding example occurs in \\"The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\\" during the flashback of Gregory Peck killing a German soldier. In just a few bars of music, Herrmann conveys everything Peck is thinking and feeling.<br /><br />But most composers score much less imaginatively than Herrmann, merely underlining what we're seeing or hearing, rather than enhancing or complementing it. Too often the music /tells/ the audience how to react to the scene. That creates a distancing effect, where the emotion is conveyed more by the music than by the acting.<br /><br />In \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", the music is almost all atmosphere. There are no Leitmotivs (other than the melancholic guitar theme, which sometimes arrives to represent Ennis and Jack's relationship), and the music rarely underlines either thoughts or events. Consider Ennis and Jack's reunion, their ecstatic embrace, and Alma's appalled reaction to seeing her husband kissing another man with more passion than he's ever shown /her/. Though this scene seemingly cries out for music, there is none! We get the direct emotions of the situation, uncolored and unfiltered.<br /><br />This was likely intentional. Annie Proulx says she's not a \\"sentimental\\" writer; I suspect Ennis and Jack's relationship (which, let's be honest, is -- even at that point in the story -- far more sexual than romantic) would seem more than a little silly if it were \\"enhanced\\" by music.<br /><br />On the rare occasions when the music does reflect the scene's affect, Santaolalla's scoring is spare, subtle, and unclich&eacute;d. This is a remarkable score that shows, in an era where 70% or more of most films' running time is scored, how less can be more.<br /><br />Comments on DVD Quality<br />-----------------------<br /><br />Projection quality in American theaters is generally mediocre or worse -- inadequate brightness, muddy/smeary/dirty prints, flat color, lack of overall sharpness, etc.<br /><br />DVDs and LVs tend to automatically \\"look better\\" than what we see in the theater, simply because removing the projection lens and screen improves sharpness/detail and increases contrast. Transfers from the negative (rather than an IP or projection print) effect further improvements in sharpness, detail, color accuracy, and saturation.<br /><br />But these improvements aren't always aesthetically desirable. The cinematographer normally lights the film knowing how what's front of the camera will \\"translate\\" to the final projection print. The biggest change is a loss of shadow detail, which can be used to advantage (eg, the substitution of a piece of cardboard for Robby's left leg in the final scene of \\"Forbidden Planet\\"). When the DVD transfer restores the \\"lost\\" detail, we see things we weren't supposed to.<br /><br />For \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", these improvements work against the film. The generally dark, dingy quality of many scenes, that so fits the film's tone, is lightened, or lost altogether. Colors are now sometimes too bright and saturated, particularly in scenes where they shouldn't be. There's far too much shadow detail -- Aguirre's trailer office now looks relatively clean and neat, and Jack's family home not quite so dirty or run-down.<br /><br />Though there's now a \\"deluxe\\" multi-DVD edition, its transfer appears to be no different from the original single disk's. I hope someday the director and cinematographer - working from the negative -- will time each scene for the appropriate density, shadow detail, color saturation, etc. We need to see \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" as it was (probably) intended. The current DVD does not, as far as I can determine, present it properly.<br /><br />That's the DVD, of course. See the following remarks on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Comments on Blu-ray Quality<br />---------------------------<br /><br />I've remarked in other reviews that the /only/ way to see a movie is /at home/, from an HD source on a big display (50\\" or larger). This couldn't be more true of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\".<br /><br />I saw the film twice theatrically, at different theaters. Particularly with the indoor scenes, the projection print was a muddy mess, though I felt at the time it was appropriate to the film's atmosphere. The DVD struck me (and a few other people) as overly clean-looking.<br /><br />The Blu-ray changes all that. We are now seeing (in effect) the camera negative, in high resolution. The most-significant improvement is not in sharpness and detail (though there are huge gains), but in tonality. The BD images truly capture what it's like to stand outside on an overcast day, or the feeling one has in someone's living room or kitchen. Annie Proulx says she writes stories about peoples' relationships with their environments (both physical and social), and the Blu-ray transfer captures Ennis and Jack's environments very well.<br /><br />Though dramas do not generally benefit much from high definition, this one is an exception.<br /><br />* Clark almost always represents relationships with women as encumbrances, or just plain unnecessary.<br /><br />** Though Gus and Woodrow are portrayed as close friends of many years' standing, their personalities -- the ever-randy, ever-whoring Gus, and the emotionally constipated ur-loner Woodrow -- seem consciously calculated to block the remotest possibility of anything sexual between them, even something as unthreatening to the sense of one's masculinity as \\"a chaw fer a chaw\\". After reading \\"Dead Man's Walk\\" and \\"Comanche Moon\\", you conclude that two such utterly different people couldn't possibly have been the lifelong friends they're portrayed as in \\"Lonesome Dove\\".<br /><br />*** While we're at it, let's throw in \\"The Epic of Gilgmamesh\\". The Gilgmamesh / Enkidu relationship is intensely homoerotic and vehemently misogynistic. Their society did not proscribe sexual relations between men; the Mitchell realization gives alternate versions that indicate they engaged in mutual sodomy.<br /><br />**** Richard Amory's classic \\"Loon\\" novels, though well-written, don't count. Though giving the illusion of reality -- Amory appears to have known far more about the realities of living in the wild than J. F. Cooper ever did -- they're fantasies set in an all-male world.<br /><br />***** An iconic short story became an iconic film. The current consensus is that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is not only the best short story \\"The New Yorker\\" has yet published, but one of the greatest American short stories, period.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|I've long been a fan of William Wilberforce - a man that God used greatly for a great cause: the abolition of slavery and the reformation of manners into the English society.  Working at a private Christian school, I often refer to Wilberforce as an example to our students of what God can do with one man wholly committed to Him.  In fact, I took sixteen of our students to see the movie when it was released and it had a very profound impact on their lives and thinking -- they saw with their own eyes the struggle of Wilberforce's life, the great cause to which he gave himself fully, and the great joy that comes from a life given in service to the King of Kings.    While I strongly recommend that all Christians watch this movie, parents I'll warn you that the issue of slavery isn't easy to watch or understand at a young age -- I would recommend this movie to middle school students and older, but probably not elementary-aged students.    There are some wonderful resources that you can get to accompany this movie for family discussions and devotions.  While most of the Wilberforce books are lengthy, but excellent, let me tell you about a few lesser-known gems.  First, John Piper has a great little 76 page book titled Amazing Grace in the Life of William Wilberforce -- great read.  This same material is actually found in another book by Piper that is simply outstanding -- it is the third book in a series by Piper to reintroduce our generation to some of the great saints of the faith -- Book Three is titled The Roots of Endurance and examines the lives of John Newton, Charles Simeon and William Wilberforce.  Finally, one of my favorite finds is a 5 disk CD audio drama set titled Amazing Grace produced by the Focus on the Family Radio Theatre -- you can listen to the lives of Newton, Wilberforce and Olaudah Equiano (a slave who purchased his freedom and was instrumental in the abolition movement in England).    So, purchase the movie, but also look for these additional resources to help deepen the discussion at home with your kids.
061891868X|5.0|What a superb book. Lee Smolin starts by sketching our progress towards a unified theory, and then critically examines the claims of string theory to be the best contender for that throne. Having demolished our fuzzy belief that string theory has been somehow \\"proven,\\" he then weighs in on the other candidates for a unified theory, namely quantum gravity and its cousins. These turn out to be little better supported by experimental evidence. The technical concepts are clearly presented, sans equations, as developments in a story peopled with fascinating characters: the great theoretical physicists of the last 50 years. As a non-math person, I found this narrative a positive pleasure to read. In comparison to other authors of books on physics for the lay public, Smolin really knows how to tell a story, without skimping the science.<br /><br />The real depth of \\"The Trouble With Physics\\" becomes apparent when Smolin pulls back to focus on physics itself. Facing the fact that the academy is a human enterprise like any other, he subjects it to the same bold criticism that he applies to scientific concepts. Here are eyeopening revelations about the culture of conferences, recommendations, networks, and above all, the economic pressures that subtly favor \\"craftspeople\\" at the expense of \\"seers.\\" It's a sorry indictment of our universities, the triumph of self-interest over vision, and Smolin explicitly includes himself in the great mass of insincere careerists who choose a safe research program over a risky one, to the detriment of scientific progress. One gets the sense that this book is, for the author, an atonement for having shortchanged his own creativity as a younger man.<br /><br />But we the readers are the beneficiaries of Smolin's decision to lay all bare. I have read literally dozens of books on physics and cosmology, and this is the first one that has presented the human side of the story as a CONTEXT, rather than in a series of postage-stamp portraits. Smolin shows that tribalism and rent-seeking do as much to shape science as any ideas. It is a lesson that will lend an extra savor, and a much-needed depth of perspective, to every science book I read in the future.lism and rent-seeking do as much to shape science as any ideas.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|I was truly dissapointed by this film, especially after the punch that Kill Bill I and II packed.  It seems as if Tarantino decided that since he has released a handful of pop culture gems, it gave him the license to indulge in some of his worst tendencies.  In the end, the film seems like a rough draft.  The characters are not developed, the dialouge is not particularly fresh, and the action (although many will argue is edge-of-your seat) is really rather mundane.  The ending was particularly ridiculous.  I hope Tarantino gets back on track on his next project, because this is a dud.  The cover of the DVD clamis that it is his most quotable movie since Pulp Fiction.  Honestly, I don't think I can quote a single line from it.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Pros: High Quality Fit & Finish, Swivels 180º Effortlessly, Low price considering overall package.    Cons: Would have liked a better/cleaner cable management solution.    When I first removed the assembled arm from the box, my first impression was wow this is heavy and very well made. The more I've used it that impression is only reinforced.     I have this mounted on the corner of a coffee table, it then swings the monitor in a 90º, 135º or 180º arc depending on where I have my recliner positioned. I swing it back to its 0º rest position each time I get out of the chair or when not used. I have a 22\\" Acer widescreen on the arm which I selected to be under the maximum permitted weight. In order to clamp on the coffee table, I had to drill two holes in the bottom L-bracket and flip it over. This increased the clamp opening to ~3\\", now very secure.    I have both a VGA and DVI cable, plus power and audio running through the two cable clips. Works but a bit unsightly. I'd like to see a more enclosed cable solution.    As others have stated, the screws are TIGHT. I couldn't rotate the monitor around the VESA bracket w/o first loosening the nut. Since this nut is hidden behind the VESA mount, important to get it right.    Edit: (April 2008) Removed the 22\\" LCD and put on a 24\\" KDS LCD. The KDS at 16 lbs is near the arm's limit of 18#. Still works well, just wouldn't want to go any heavier.    Edit: (Dec. 2009) After rotating the arm 180º several dozen times a day for 2-years it got so it would barely move. I downloaded the PDF from the Ergotron website, then disassembled the pivot, bone dry. I cleaned the steel pin and aluminum socket, applied stem grease and viola, like new again.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The nice people that ought to see this film never will.  They are too attached to their friends, the Clintons, Obama, or that swell haircut guy and his phoney wife.  It's for the children you know. Hell is paved with good intentions.
0399150331|1.0|Cornwell's books seem to get worse & worse.  I am so tired of reading about how rich Scarpetta is. How much do we have to read about Scarpetta's costly homes & cars.  If that's not bad enough now we have to hear how rich Lucy is too. Lucy has become even more nauseating - which is amazing.      In this bk. it seems like more time is spent on Scarpetta whining & analyzing her thoughts than analyzing any evidence.  Towards the end I just wanted everyone to die so I'd never have to read another Scarpetta novel.           Sometimes authors have bad spells and pull out of it, however I think Cornwell will never emerge.  What's sad is this isn't even close to the worst Scarpetta novel.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Wow.  This cd really IS Magic.  The Boss is back.    I heard Radio Nowhere on the radio in the car and thought, that is really good.  I think I need to buy that CD.  I am really really glad I did.    I don't think there's a track on this CD that I don't like.  I would definitely recommend this to old and new Springsteen fans.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|It's been a very long time since I've waiting for Stravinsky's ballets by Stravinsky, even though I have some very good performances by Boulez, Bernstein and Abbado...but nothing like original author's direction, the scent of his work beyond formalisms of the score. And finally, I made it...and even more! Having a complete box containing the works of Stravinsky BY Stravinsky is a real treasure, by all means.    This box set is quite complete, excellent sound and very cheap. Only two observations: one, operas and melodramas need lyrics and, two, it would be much better considering some works in its original language, like Les Noces.    Anyway, excelent job and very convenient...give it a try!

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Intro Note: My original review of MAGIC has generated a lot of votes, but also a lot of negative backlash, so I thought I would elaborate on a few things before we get to the review proper. First, I am posting a revised version of the review. The original is still listed on Amazon.co.uk. Now onward.<br /><br />When I wrote this review back in early October, I made it quite clear that, although I like Springsteen's music, I haven't taken the time to go through his discography like I have with other musicians. My original review was written from a point of view of a middle-of-the-road Springsteen fan. Although Springsteen obviously has a very strong, devoted fanbase, I think my status as a good, but not hardcore, fan represents a good proportion of potential listeners for this album, and so is a valid or helpful review.<br /><br />I freely confessed I hadn't listen to all of his albums, though I have a passing familiarity with most of them. People really took me to task for not having heard TUNNEL OF LOVE, which is USA's followup, even though I made it clear I haven't listened to Springsteen as extensively as I have other musicians due to time and money. Yes, you an be a fan of Springsteen and not have heard TUNNEL. I'm a Tom Waits fan and there's a lot of his albums I haven't heard all the way through.<br /><br />Since I posted the review, I have taken the time to listen to TUNNEL, and have even wrote a review of it for Amazon. It's quite good, and it's a perfect bridge between USA and MAGIC. I consider it his pop trilogy, much like NEBRASKA, TOM JOAD, and DEVILS & DUST is his acoustic/folk trilogy.<br /><br />Though I've been accused of \\"not being a fan\\" because I hadn't heard TUNNEL, listening to it really didn't radically change my position on MAGIC. It only slightly modified it.<br /><br />All major artists have various populations in their fanbases. I count myself hardcore when it comes to Bob Dylan (see my review for the new DYLAN compilation for further elaboration). With Springsteen, I've always liked his music. But just remember one thing. Each album services the various populations in different ways, and I was writing from a different perspective than those who have followed Bruce for years and have all his records memorized and been to lots of his shows. But it doesn't mean I'm not a fan, or that Bruce's music doesn't move me.<br /><br />Because it does.<br />Mike London, November 16, 2007<br />--------------<br />Revised Review<br /><br />I must confess, ever since I learned about MAGIC, Springsteen's newest, I was pretty excited. Though I haven't gotten into Springsteen the same extent I've gotten into some other rock giants (the biggest being Bob Dylan), I proudly count myself<br />among his fans, though not, perhaps, a card carrying member of the Asbury Fan Club (or Cult perhaps would be a better term).<br /><br />I also have another confession. I've been listening to this album incessantly for the past month, since early September from the version leaked on the internet. Now, if history repeats itself like Radiohead with KID A back in 2000, this prerelease leak should drive sells. I know it made me want to buy it. I can't stop listening to it. We haven't heard Bruce do a real pop album like this for years, and it's great to hear him do a new record in vein of TUNNEL and USA.<br /><br />Of course, a big reason for the great sound is Springsteen is back with the E Streeet Band. Springsteen would not use the E Street Band on an album for a full eighteen years following USA. They finally resurfaced on the 2002 effort THE RISING. And while THE RISING is certainly a fine record, it was largely preoccupied with the post 9/11 universe we as the international community have been thrust into.<br /><br />While Springsteen has been active releasing albums since then, he didn't use the band, and the albums he did release were either folk or bluegrass driven. Which is not to say they're bad albums. DEVILS & DUST is great, especially the title cut. SEEGER SESSIONS is an interesting, and very fun, history lesson about Pete Seeger, even if he did ax the sound equipment at Dylan's Newport appearance in 1965. But those looking for Springsteen's rock sound will be disappointed by them.<br /><br />But not now. MAGIC is the album we've been waiting for for a long time. While there are some quite serious moments, overall Springsteen just lets his hair down and doing some great pop rock and roll in a way that only he can.<br /><br />Without a doubt, MAGIC is one of Springsteen's funnest albums in the last twenty five years. In fact, I would argue that MAGIC is closest to that seminal 1984 masterpiece and TUNNEL OF LOVE out of all of Springsteen's previous albums. MAGIC feels very much akin to those two towering records.<br /><br />To me, these three albums are Springsteen's harrowing forays into pop music, and sound very much like a pop-trilogy.<br /><br />BORN IN THE USA is a strange animal. Musically, it's upbeat, it's poppy, it's just fun to listen too. BORN IN THE USA, though very pop-driven, had a dark pessimism underbelly that has always been a constant in Springsteen's early records. Lyrically, however, the album featured the characters in the songs following the same dark, desperate fate that most of Springsteen's narrators did on DARKNESS, THE RIVER, NEBRASKA, etc. USA dressed up Springsteen's bitter stories about his down-on-their-luck characters in such brilliantly poppy music that the Reagan administration famously used the title cut in their bid for reelection. The political publicist machine can be pretty damned oblivious at times.<br /><br />TUNNEL OF LOVE examines marriage, love, and the failures of commitment in a heart-breaking way. TUNNEL lacks the strange dichotomy so apparent with USA between lyrical outlook (USA's lyrics are more akin to singer-songwriter and blues than pop) and actual music. But TUNNEL is a much different record than either lyrically, and is a rather devastating and insightful analysis of relationships between the sexes.<br /><br />MAGIC, on the other hand, is just fun, but, like USA, can be rather deceiving if you listen only to the music and don't pay that much attention to the lyrics. There's a wistful nostalgia here that we haven't seen from Springsteen before, a remembrance of things past. There's anger here too (\\"Radio Nowhere\\", a diatribe against the radio landscape of the new millennium, \\"Last to Die\\", a politically charged rocker, and the title track, a song that can unfortunately apply to several different government administrations).<br /><br />Springsteen makes some serious statements on MAGIC, but he still manages to make the whole affair quite fun, and there are a few numbers here that sound like Springsteen playing rock and roll and pop music just for the hell of it. All the songs sound like they belong together, with the sole exception of the hidden track \\"Terry's Song\\", a tribute to one of his friends who died. While a pleasant enough song, doesn't really do a lot for me. While there are some dark undercurrents on MAGIC, the sound itself is rather glorious. Especially given how long we haven't really got to hear something like this from Bruce.<br /><br />Another thing that should be mentioned is the way in which Brendan O'Brien, the album's producer (also affiliated with Pearl Jam, Neil Young, and any number of major rock acts), and Springsteen's chose to record it. Working around the band's busy schedule, they would record their own parts solo with O'Brien producing, and then O'Brien would assemble all the different tracks into a finished song. The sole exception to this recording process was the Big Man, Clarence Clemmons, the E Street Band's famous saxophonist. Springsteen personally oversaw all of Clemmons' sessions, due to the rich dynamic relationship they have with one another.<br /><br />While this protools method of recording albums can sap modern music of their vitality, it's amazing how organic and lived in the music feels. Of course, this is Springsteen, and this is the E Street band, so they obviously know how to make great music. What a backing band they truly are.<br /><br />Like most of Springsteen's music, none of this is disposable music. The best pop never is.<br /><br />Ultimately, MAGIC is probably the best album for 2007. For those Springsteen fans who didn't much care for DEVILS & DUST and SEEGER SESSIONS, rejoice! We have Springsteen making some phenomenal rock and roll at long last!<br />--------------<br />Original Review: Bruce Springsteen - Magic October 10, 2007<br /><br />I must confess, ever since I learned about MAGIC, Springsteen's newest, I was pretty excited.

In fact, I would argue that MAGIC is closest akin to that seminal 1984 masterpiece out of all of Springsteen's previous albums.<br /><br />Though I haven't heard TUNNEL OF LOVE, USA's chronological followup, for my money MAGIC sounds like the true sequel.

The political publicist machine can be pretty damned oblivious at times.<br /><br />MAGIC, on the other hand, has USA's same pop rock sensibilities, but minus the overarching pessimism. While there are some nostalgic moments on the album, overall, MAGIC is the truest sequel to BORN IN THE USA that we have yet seen, and is in many ways unique to Springsteen's canon. Originally THE RIVER was to be a single album of lighthearted songs called THE TIES THAT BIND. Twenty Seven years later we get that album, a pop album where Springsteen's not trying to make an overarching statement. And what a great rock album it is.<br /><br />This is Springsteen's purest pop album, and its sense of fun and lack of serious, grandiose statements is what THE RIVER would have been had Springsteen stuck with his original plans. It's good to make good music just for the hell of it, but don't get me wrong. None of this is disposable music (the best pop never is). All the songs sound like they belong together, with the sole exception of the hidden track \\"Terry's Song\\", a tribute to one of his friends who died.

B000TZUSOY|5.0|I can't believe I am only the second person to review this beautiful recording. Todd Stellhorn's review (see below) can't be topped, it's a perfect description of what most of you are missing out on by not owning this 1962 recording led by Ike Quebec. My applause goes out to R.V.G. and Blue Note for re-releasing this gem.<br /><br />Quebec's playing is perfect as he emits so much tranquil, sensuous emotion from his bluesy tenor. And what truly is amazing about his flawless, tender performance is the fact that he was dying of cancer at the time and in intense pain. Yet, you would never know by listening to this serene, sunny recording. Quebec adds a flavor of blues and sultriness to his own unique interpretation of the bossa nova. Kenny Burrell co-stars on guitar and proves to be more than an exceptional subordinate to the great tenor. This is Burrell at his best, a bit restrained, but one of my favorite performances of his ever (which is saying a lot!). He compliments Quebec and the fine, rhythm section - Wendell Marshall (bass), Willie Bobo (drums), and Garvin Masseaux (chekere) - impeccably. As Quebec stated in the liner notes \\"Kenny was able to be more free with the beat. He helped a lot to create that floating feeling of bossa nova and he was able to feed me more flexibly and more subtly.\\" And to elaborate a bit more on the other players, all three lay down the rhythms smoothly, never too flashy or bold, seemingly more than content to let Ike and Kenny shine (it really is all about these two on this particular effort).<br /><br />I sincerely can't say enough about this one. Along with \\"Blue & Sentimental\\" this is my personal favorite of Quebec's work as a leader. If you are a fan of Quebec and/or Burrell you will really be in for quite a treat. I can promise you with every fiber of my being that you will not be disappointed for one minute of just over 48 minutes of soulful, bluesy, bossa nova jazz.<br /><br />I would add another star if I could!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I bought Sara's album after downloading \\"Love Song\\" for free on Itunes. I immediately fell in love with that song, as well as every other one on the cd (my personal faves are \\"gravity\\", \\"between the lines\\" and \\"city\\"). Her sound is so refreshing and different from all the usual 'junk' you hear when you turn on the radio nowadays. I find myself humming her songs throughout the day and i cant get the catchy, creative lyrics out of my head! Just returned from a Maroon 5 concert at the Garden where Sara opened up for them. This girl has got PIPES! She sounded fantabulous LIVE! And she's so down-to-earth (we got to meet her afterwards during intermission where she was doing a mini cd signing). So whoever is on the fence about this album, please give it a chance. You wont be disappointed. I promise :-)

You should at least be familiar with what shutter speed, aperture, and ISO is (just google it).  Scott wrote this book as if he was speaking to you directly.  His jokes got me to laugh several times and his sense of humor is fun.  Definitely a must have
B000R7HY0K|2.0|I like some of Tarantino's films (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown), but this movie was very dull. The entire first half of the film takes place in a bar where everyone is drinking and getting stoned. The second half takes place at diner with a bunch of pointless girl talk. The action scenes are few. I was bored out of mind and wondered when this movie was going to be over. This movie wasn't that great.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Such a strong and powerful music! Tremonti at his best and Kennedy even better! Highly recommend!
B00008CLOA|5.0|First off, I love the color they chose for the cover here. The dark blue backdrop for the prism looks beautiful. An awesome album cover made better.<br />Anyway, DSOTM is one of those albums where everything that can go right does in a spectacular way. Lyrics? Perfect. Melodies? Unforgettable. Performances? Spot-on. Production? Amazing. The best part of the equation is that this ISN'T my favorite Floyd album - that is the follow-up release, Wish You Were Here. But this is still a masterpiece.<br />Opening things up is a haunting song, Speak to Me/Breathe. Speak to Me is pretty much a non-song, just avant-garde white noise, but Breathe is a lingering ode to environmentalism that is later reprised on another definite highlight, the chilling Time. Time is debatably the best song on the album - the first minute or so, with all the clocks going off, followed by that killer keyboard/drum pattern, is something to hear; and the guitar solo... my god, it's phenomenal. So are the lyrics. Love the lyrics! Time's effect on man may be overdiscussed, but Floyd takes it on tremendously. In between these is On the Run, another non-song with a nonetheless amazing keyboard part. The Great Gig in the Sky deals frankly with, depending on who you ask, either death or sex - all without saying a word. But Clare Torry's moans are spooky either way. The tension/release thing, along with the \\"climax\\", makes me think it's supposed to simulate sex, but the spoken bits occasionally thrown in hint at death. Who knows, maybe it's both? Okay, I'm thinkin' way too hard about this. Let's get to the rest. The 7/4-4/4 greed protest Money is another highlight, with a great bassline and jaw-dropping tenor sax and guitar solos. Us and Them is a chilling, dreamy exploration of electronics with a fantastic hazy sax solo. Either this or Time is my favorite song on the record. It's a VERY tough call. The trippy instrumental Any Color You Like is decent, but it's nonetheless the weakest song on a strong collection. However, the Brain Damge/Eclipse medley is even more brilliance - the first has fantastic lyrics, beautiful slide guitar, and a giant, explosive chorus (\\"I'LL SEE YOU ON THE DARK SIIIDE OF THE MOON... AAH... AAAH...\\"), and the second, while essentially just a stream-of-conscienceness burst of pseudo-philosophy, is still quite melodic and fades away to an ending that's the sound of a heartbeat, which is precisely how the album started.<br />Awesome stuff. Really, the only thing that keeps this from being Floyd's best album is Wish You Were Here. I've never been stoned in my life, and this is still one of my favorites.owever, the Brain Damge/Eclipse medley is even more brilliance - the first has fantastic lyrics, beautiful slide guitar, and a giant, explosive chorus (\\"I'LL SEE YOU ON THE DARK SIIIDE OF THE MOON...

B000URDEB0|4.0|First off, I was very eager to hear Annette, the new lead singer. I am a female singer myself and have always admired Tarja as being one of very few (if not the only) female singers who inspired me. With Tarja's operatic voice against a symphonic metal background, it was unlike anything anyone had ever heard before. That being said, Annette had some tough shoes to fill.     Well, to put it plainly, Annette's voice is very disappointing to me. She is definitely not Tarja (which I expected) but out of all the thousands of singer demos, THIS is the best they could find? Don't get me wrong, Annette has a good voice, but it's very common-sounding and gets buried in the bombastic symphony/metal. Her voice is very one-dimensional and doesn't convey enough emotion. There is a slight nasal quality to her voice that really annoys me. She could certainly be better suited for pop or, sadly, even pop country music.     I think the future of Nightwish is about to change... a lot. The band may end up going to a simpler, more pop-oriented direction to suit the vocals a little better. That saddens me. But if the band is happy with her and the majority of fans like her, then good. But I can't say I'm a huge fan of her quite yet.
B000002MTU|5.0|Anyone who likes Clapton for his blues material, and who lives in fear of \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" and others - this includes me, by the way - will probably get a lot out of this record. Because it is, at long last, a return to electric blues. The obvious question of what took him so long aside, this one rocks. Now I am amazed at what took him so damn long to pull one of these, but I'm glad that he finally did. This is, after all, his best album in quite a while. The Chicago blues cuts are especially memorable and enthusiastic: every idiot has done \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", but Clapton's no idiot, and he really adds a lot of flavor to it; \\"Five Long Years\\" piles on the emotion; the two Freddie King covers (\\"How Long Blues\\"; \\"Someday After a While\\") are both very memorable, powerful blues tracks with awesome sax parts; \\"It Hurts Me Too\\" and \\"How Long Blues\\" have some of the best singing Clapton has done in years; and the acoustic blues \\"Driftin'\\" easily measures up to the rock tracks, thanks to Clapton's acoustic playing and some intriguing percussion. And in case you ever thought Clapton was a lousy guitarist, I can't see anyone still thinking so after \\"Groanin' the Blues\\". Other than \\"Driftin'\\", the softer tracks aren't spectacular, though he does pull a convincingly authentic bluesman vocal on \\"Third Degree\\" - something Mick Jagger is quite good at, by the way. With the only weak track being a dull \\"Motherless Child\\", I have to give this the nod as my favorite Clapton studio album - other than Layla, of course.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has written another masterpiece. The characters creep under your skin and shake you to the bone. You get so involved in the story that you start living in it. You cry with them, you laugh with them, you feel there pain, their anguish. As you turn every page, you feel sad that in a few hours, you will finish the book and then you can no longer 'feel' the characters in the book.   I am normally skeptic, about fiction written about the muslim world that only represents a biased view point that 'sells' to the western world. However Hosseini has written multi-faceted story that is spread over 30 years. It potrays life of Afghan women not just under Taliban but also under warlord and militias armed and supported by the West. I can only admire the courage of Afghanis, innocent men and women, who continue to be hopeful after 30 years of war. I can only pray that one day, they get to see their homeland free from war and carnage, flourishing and prospering.
B00007GZQI|5.0|McGrath's film adaptation differs considerably Southern's novel. Relocated to London in the 1960s, it introduces an orphan whom Sir Guy Grand picks up in a park and on a whim, decides to adopt. The role was written with Ringo Starr (who plays it) in mind.<br /><br />The Magic Christian is an unrelenting and often heavy-handed satire on capitalism, greed, racism and other human vanities. Notable are the appearances of (pre-Monty Python) John Cleese and Graham Chapman (uncredited), who had written an earlier version of the film script, of which only the scenes in which they appear survived.<br /><br />This movie is great fun, I only wish there had been some remastering on the CD, rather than just a core dump to different media.  But that quibble aside, it's still one of my very favorite movies.
B00005JPQR|4.0|I have not read the books, but after seeing these three films I will. First off this movie flows smoothly from the second movie and is an exciting third installment. Jason Bourne, once again played by Matt Damon still does not know whom he is. But after disturbing what peace he thought he might have last movie by killing his girlfriend, he is out for vengeance. He is even more driven than before to find out who he is. As Bourne once again moves quickly across the globe in what has become his never ending search for his self, dispatching all who gets in his way. This movie is entertaining and suspenseful. Yes there is non-stop chase scenes and fighting, but they are not repetitive and will keep you entertained. In this movie Bourne has flash backs of the death of his girlfriend and of his original induction into the C.I.A. and some of his training. And you will be happy to know that he will at least learn his true name in this movie. The movie also has some stars return to play recurring rolls, which was a nice surprise. There is also a political message in the movie for the U.S. public. I'll leave it to you to figure it out. As you decipher this modern political message within the movie, it will; make it even better. Though not everyone will like the message. I will give you a hint; believe it or not it is a liberal message. But hey, I enjoyed all the action and to heck with the message. After all this is work of fiction with a lot of action. Stay tune for Bourne Four.
B0000509C4|4.0|I love films that consist of a few short stories and Creepshow 2 is one of the best out there. The first time I saw it I was very young a remeber it being so enjoyable being creepy and fun at the same time. I decided to check it out to see if it was still as good, and luckily it was.<br /><br />The film consists of three short stories;<br /><br />\\"Chief WoodNHead\\" A story about a shop owners wooden Indian that comes to life for the evening to exact revenge. (Probably my favorite one)<br /><br />\\"The Raft\\" A story involving some kids who decide to take a swim out to a raft in the middle of the lake only to find a man eating substance stands in their way.<br /><br />\\"The Hitchhiker\\" A story of an unfaithful wife who runs down a hitchhiker and finds that she can't quite get rid of him.<br /><br />I would definately recommend checking out Creepshow 2 if you haven't already. It's really a classic horror flick.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile is currently my favorite performing artist. Her voice is incredible, her songs are so well-written and cover several styles of music, from rock (Late Morning Lullaby) to folksy (Have You Ever) to bluegrass (Josephine). The Story, a recent gift from my husband, was a much appreciated and exciting addition to my music collection. There are a few subtle, 'grown up' changes to the new album that distinctively set it apart from her first album, and really define her as stepping out of the 'up-and-coming' category and into the 'real' performing artist category. There are a few songs that reflect personal tragedy or angst, as one reviewer pointed out, but I think they're balanced out by other songs that are not so tragic. I really enjoy listening to this album and I am really looking forward to seeing Brandi perform at the House of Blues.
0792846443|5.0|Misery is one of the best in the horror/suspense genre. I have to say I don't think I've seen a better movie that was based off of a book. Usually the book is so good and the movie is sub par, but this one is the exception.<br /><br />The story begins as writer Paul Sheldon(James Cann)crashes in car while driving in a blizzard. He awakes from being unconscious to find himself in the home and care of a very obsessed fan(Kathy Bates). As he gets better he begins to realize his caretaker has no intention on letting him go anywhere.<br /><br />Exceptional thriller which anyone would enjoy. I completely recommend Misery especially if you are a Steven King fan.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This is a superb DVD, and a template for how to make them right! If you choose Tracks on Disk One, you get a window splitting the songs into the 10 from \\"On An Island\\" and the 13 from other sources, including, of course, your Pink Floyd favorites. Disk Two also offers an option to select just the music tracks, and despite a few that are weak in the beginning of the list, again you have great music easily accessible! There are also other elements available, from documentaries to videos, and it's all good. The music is excellent throughout, with good showmanship, as we've come to expect from Pink Floyd, and, basically, you just can't go wrong with this one!
B000000W6X|5.0|Massive Attack have gotten a lot of praise, but most of it is either for their first album Blue Lines, or for their third album Mezzanine. Protection tends to get lost between those two. But in fact, it's Protection that's really the best Massive Attack album. I can listen to it the whole way through, and when it's over, I find myself wishing there was even more. I can't even remember the last time I bought an album that I could say that about.    Perhaps Protection doesn't have the same reputation as Blue Lines and Mezzanine because it doesn't have any \\"obvious\\" hits, deliberately powerful songs like \\"Safe From Harm\\" or \\"Angel.\\" The biggest single here is \\"Protection,\\" a long eight-minute rumination without any particular build-up or dramatic climax. The chorus isn't a pop chorus, either, because it doesn't repeat a hook. But nevertheless, the song is beautiful. The gentle mid-tempo rhythm steadily draws one into the mood of the song.    The lyrics in the album don't matter so much. Massive Attack were never known for being great poets. But the words do contribute to the mood. In \\"Protection,\\" Tracey Thorn encourages \\"you\\" to take care of someone who needs help, which first means some girl, but later seems to become \\"you.\\" The choice of words is good: \\"You can lean on me / And that's more than love, that's the way it should be\\" and \\"She's a girl and you're a boy / Sometimes we look so small.\\" I really like Massive Attack's style of romanticism -- instead of dramatizing individual angst and professing eternal love (okay, except for \\"One Love,\\" I guess, but even that was more about how Horace Andy believes in being faithful than about star-crossed bliss), they usually refer to smaller, everyday situations and imply that small changes in these situations might have a great impact. No wonder they make the best make-out music. By the way, Protection is excellent for that purpose.    Then there's \\"Karmacoma,\\" another candidate for a big single that also doesn't quite fitcomfortably into that role. The song does have a pop chorus, and features Robert del Naja and Tricky in a Blue-Lines-like rap exchange, but it's driven by a very curious reggae-inflected rhythm and a groovy keyboard break that resembles old Latin music more than techno or hip-hop. The song is upbeat, but it has the same hushed production as \\"Protection,\\" which makes it sound disconcerting and vaguely ominous. This is very different from the band's earlier work, and it's all the more impressive when you consider that, by 1994, other bands had just begun catching up to Blue Lines, which had been released three years earlier.    Protection is very different from Massive Attack's other albums stylistically. I usually say that Blue Lines is a modern-day soul album, with elements of rap and techno. Those things are still present here, but the overall atmosphere is closer to some kind of old-style, early twentieth-century romance than to smooth 70s soul, albeit with a techno production. There are two instrumentals which use pianos and strings for the main melodies. Both of them are gorgeous. \\"Weather Storm\\" in particular anchors the pianos with a deep electronic bass groove and dub-style keyboard textures. \\"Heat Miser\\" repeats what sounds like someone breathing through an oxygen mask. Somehow, next to the strings, this has a poignant effect, creating a sense of fragility.    Protection also has the least reliance of all Massive Attack albums on the band's core vocalists. Robert del Naja appears on only two songs, compared to four on each of the other albums. The ever-reliable Horace Andy has one turn on \\"Spying Glass,\\" a remake of one of his own old Jamaican standards, with a great deep house beat and some reggae-style drum breaks. The other songs are either instrumentals or use guest vocalists, and by the way, Protection also has the best guest vocalists of any Massive Attack album. Nicolette Suwoton in particular has a very distinctive vocal style, but both women perform with subtlety and dramatic restraint, compared to Shara Nelson's occasional soul-diva histrionics (not that that's altogether a bad thing) or Sara Jay's angsty spoiled-teenager voice.    But even though Protection doesn't have any obvious hits, I liked it immediately, whereas it took me a long time to really enjoy Blue Lines and Mezzanine as albums. That's because those other albums also have a bunch of lesser songs that don't make strong impressions when compared to the big hits. But the songs on Protection are consistently excellent. The second side is just as good as the first. For instance, \\"Better Things\\" might seem like a rewrite of \\"Protection,\\" because it features the same vocalist and uses a similar musical backdrop, but in fact, it stands up perfectly well on its own. The lyrics are knowing and bitter, and Tracey Thorn delivers them with a weary understatement that almost makes one feel vicariously ashamed for whoever it is that she's addressing. Immediately after that is \\"Eurochild,\\" which has the kind of noirish menace that I really wish someone could depict these days. Tricky and del Naja's relaxed, gravelly half-whispers are perfect for suggesting danger underneath the surface, and halfway through the song there's an instantly catchy keyboard hook. This would be a good candidate for a big hit, but it wasn't released as a single.    The only flaw of the album is the very last track, a live cover of \\"Light My Fire\\" by The Doors. The recording is so muddy that only Horace Andy's voice is audible, and anyway, that's not the sort of song that Massive Attack are best at. I prefer to think of it as an unnecessary bonus track rather than part of the album. The album itself, however, is perfect, and I highly recommend it regardless of whether or not you usually enjoy this kind of music.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|If you own an ordinary TV and love the original untouched Star Wars pick up this DVD. The quality of the original feature included as a bonus disc, was to my eyes, on my 20 inch screen, excellent. The absence of CGI enhancement or the glossy sheen of contemporary movies is, to me, a positive. I'm very happy with these original films (I also bought the other two, Empire And Jedi, at Big W). The 3 films cost me 48 Australian dollars. I agree Lucas has handled the original series contemptuously given many aficionados have widescreens, but I and many others do not.     Given the bad reviews, I was expecting the original feature to be woefully hazy and grainy, but it is sharp and clear as any original TV broadcast, if not a little better (and of course in the original theatre widescreen ratio - no cropping to fit the TV screen). Also you can have subtitles on the original feature - which filled in a lot of dialogue I missed and was really good to comprehend the entire movie for the first time. The subtitles also elegantly appear below the frame of the movie in the black area rather than within film's frames themselves.    I'm very very happy with this purchase and would like to now buy the original posters of the original movies, and in my universe pretend like the prequels never existed in this galaxy or any other. Of course I am more tolerant than most fans cos I didn't bother buying the CGI messed up new editions, that are also included here, earlier. Lucas will probably mess up the originals once again with CGI \\"fixing\\" if these originals are remastered and released on HD-DVD, so I am happy to have this version.
B00008LKDY|5.0|This is by far the best sounding SACD I have. Very well played and incredible recording. Podger is in top form as is the ensemble.this is a 2 disc set, so it is also a bargain!
009917961X|5.0|I highly recommend \\"The Rainmaker\\" by John Grisham.  It is an extremely entertaining book - one of his very best.      This novel is interesting for the fact that it is written in the first person point of view, an unusual choice, particularly for Grisham, but it works wonderfully.  He uses this to great advantage to show what the main character is thinking, and the result is frequently humorous.   It works so well, in fact, I wonder why it isn't done more often, instead of the usual third person point of view.      Add suspense, strong characters, legal intrigue, clean crisp writing, and humor and you have all the ingredients for a great read!  I applaud John Grisham.  He is truly one of our finest novelists.

B000UBMSB8|3.0|The movie itself is 5 starts, but what Warner's doing now is not cool, hence the three stars.  If you want the \\"working\\" cut, you either have to go to the \\"ultimate\\" collection and pay $30 more, or buy one of the HD releases, which offer the five disc collection in a non \\"ultimate\\" edition for just $3 more than the four disc version.      Looks like they're starting to push HD by offering extra features in teh HD releases.  This may be a repeat of earlier campaigns where the studios try to push people to go out and buy many of the same movies they already have again, only in the new format.

B00005JPRF|1.0|Resident Evil: Extinction (Russell Mulcahy, 2007)<br /><br />Sometimes I have to remind myself that there was a time when I liked Russell Mulcahy. Razorback is low-budget and cheesy, but it's loads of fun, and Ricochet is watchable, if dated, when I'm in the mood for such things. His music videos, of course, are legendary (he was behind the lens for some of the most popular videos from Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, and Billy Joel, among others). Something happened, though. Maybe it had to do with him landing Highlander II, one of the silliest movies ever to come down the pike. 'Cause it was after that that things started going to pot pretty quick. The most recent evidence of his slide into eternal celluloid [censored for Amazon consumption] is the third (and, please God, the final) Resident Evil movie, Extinction.<br /><br />I loved the first Resident Evil, and still consider it one of the two or three best movies in the odd, quirky subgenre of the action-flick videogame adaptation. The second wasn't nearly as good, but still had some fun with the franchise and was a movie that was worth watching a second time. This one follows the same formula: put Milla Jovovich in something sexy (in this case, olive drab short-shorts), give her a fair-to-middling-known, but excellent, right-hand star (in this case, Ali Larter of Final Destination), unleash some zombies, throw the Umbrella Corporation in there somewhere, and away you go. It worked in the first two, but you know that Mulcahy and scriptwriter Paul W. S. Anderson (and why he allowed this to happen to his baby is beyond me) decided to take it in a slightly different direction. Kinda. And so the first five minutes plays like a rehash of the action scenes from the first movie. They added a few details to let you know you weren't in an actual flashback, but still. The we get to the actual story, which has Alice (Jovovich) out on her own, having abandoned the group she was with at the end of Apocalypse, and Carlos and L.J. (The Mummy's Oded Fehr and Roll Bounce's Mike Epps) tagging along with a band of survivors led by Claire (Larter). The two bands happen to bump into each other in the desert, where, of course, despite needing to avoid cities because of the ravenous undead, they decide to go try their luck in... Las Vegas!<br /><br />I could forgive that you can see the end of this movie coming five minutes into it. I could forgive the impossibly contrived and painfully linear plot. I could forgive the general stupidity of a storyline that allows almost all of its characters to suddenly disappear with almost a half an hour left in a ninety-five minute movie. (Okay, no I can't, but it sounds good.) I could forgive it all if there were one, just one, good thing about this movie to balance it all out. Larter fills the good-actor-balancing-out-the-rest-of-this-marginal-acting role (filled by Michelle Rodriguez in the first movie and Jared Harris in the second) nicely, but Mulcahy never pushes her, and honestly, she doesn't have enough screen time to really do much. There's just enough character development to make me wonder why there was no character development; even the characters we've seen before come off as gold-leaf-thin. The new ones? Forget it. Even that might be permissible if this movie started with the action and then never let up, but no; the first half of the movie seems to have been set aside to give us some insight into these characters, and we never get any. Mulcahy uses it to move all his pieces into place, and that's exactly how he treats there characters-- as pieces. It really feels like the entire movie were designed around someone saying \\"hey, wouldn't it be cool to build a set of a ruined Las Vegas?\\". The worst part is, they never actually take advantage of most of the set, with all the Vegas action taking place in one small area. The entire palette of special effects was lifted from the first movie. The direction is competent, but barely more than that; the same with the cinematography, which stuns me given a desert setting and an Australian director (the Aussies grow some fine cinematographers, especially when working with sere canvasses; Mulcahy, however, brought on UK lensman David Johnson, who does fine work with small, cramped spaces, as he did in the original Resident Evil, but doesn't seem to know what do do with himself once he gets outside).<br /><br />And please, for the love of god. I knew someone would eventually break down and use a cover of \\"White Rabbit\\" in one of these movies, but I was hoping it wouldn't happen until after I died. Oh, well. Too late. And it's a bad cover, too. (The impact was only slightly lessened by my seeing a trailer for the upcoming Iron Man movie, which it seems will feature the original Black Sabbath track.)<br /><br />The twenty-first of September, 2007, was a banner day in film, with America seeing, for one of the very few times in the past thirty years, a wide theatrical release of a David Cronenberg film. Me? I got to the theater ten minutes after it started, so I went to see Resident Evil: Extinction instead. I wish I'd saved my money. *which stuns me given a desert setting and an Australian director (the Aussies grow some fine cinematographers, especially when working with sere canvasses; Mulcahy, however, brought on UK lensman David Johnson, who does fine work with small, cramped spaces, as he did in the original Resident Evil, but doesn't seem to know what do do with himself once he gets outside).

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Buy it listen to it maybe twice and your hooked. I have loved everything Bruce has been doing over the recent years the Segar Sessions were just genius but this new album to me is back to the Bruce we knew. It is way beyond me how this guy writes and more so sings his lyrics. With ref to his last song on the album, I recon they broke the mould when they made Bruce, there will never be another.     Buy it any true Bruce fan will love it!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This is WITHOUT A DOUBT Springsteen's most solid offering in years.EVERY TRACK grabs you musically...Unfortunately the production and sound of it makes you want to throw up! I just can NOT believe a player of Springsteens stature would allow this wall of muddled noise to hit the public without cleaning it up 1st. You WILL NEED the lyric sheet because most vocals are un-recognizable and dulled by bass guitar and bass drum. A plus on the content...a big FAT F on the sound/production.
B000PKG6TE|1.0|OK . . . so the first time I heard the album I thought it was terrible.  I've listened to it in its entirety a few times now and I still think its awful.  I loved their self titled, Rated R, Songs and Lullabies but this one really blows chunks.  I can't even bear to listen to it anymore because it makes me so depressed.  What happened to you Josh . . . why did you do this to me!?  I mean . . . I really feel like crying . . . .
0761129235|5.0|The kaizen way represents a totally different way of thinking for most westerners.  Rather than setting big bold goals or overly ambitious New Years resolutions, the kaizen way would have us take small manageable steps.  It is the process of continual improvement.<br /><br />Robert Maurer does a very good job to explaining the underlying psychology of why kaizen works so well.  Basically we all have the fight/flight mechanism that is activated when we encounter something new.  We have come to express this as stress.  Dr. Maurer says this is actually a form of fear, and if the fear of change is too great, change will not occur. But if we take small baby steps, we do not engage the fight or flight mechanism and eventually our brain comes to accept the gradual change.<br /><br />The book is a very easy read.  The concept has many applications - from reaching your goals, breaking bad habits or improving relationships.<br /><br />If you have attempted to change your behavior in any way and not met with the success you wanted, I would highly recommend you read this book.  It will give you a totally new approach to achieving your goals.<br /><br />The concepts outlined in the book can be of significant benefits to those who may not even be aware of the need.  Stress is the at the root cause of the majority of all health problems.  By apply the kaizen way to your daily life, you can reduce the stress level in your life.<br /><br />It should be read and the concepts implemented.  It will change your life.
0805079831|5.0|The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein addresses the legacy of Neocon economics vis-a-vis Milton Friedman with superior research  in a very readable prose style (IMHO). It's actually fascinating, not to mention a long overdue exposure of how a certain school of economics was able to use developing nations such as Pinochet's Chili and most recently Iraq as laboratories to test (by way of begging the question) Friedman's theory of so-called free markets on a macro scale.  The overnight success of these schemes as reported in the popular media was actually on all counts an intentional distortion of what amounted to an exercise in disaster capitalism that benefited only a relative few, while actually ruining the target nations financially. That is to say, wherever Friedman sent advisers (backed by the CIA), widespread poverty and human rights violations were soon to follow. Once again, this is a fascinating book.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is a powerful album with a mix of pop, rock, and r&b. X-tina talks about her life and some of the hardships she's endured. This is a very personal album dealing with all sorts of issues ranging from domestic violence to casual sex to believing in yourself and always having faith. Some of the best songs on the album are the ones where Christina is talking directly to her audience. Songs like \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Keep On Singing My Song\\", and \\"Soar\\" are very inspirational to listeners. Other songs like \\"Dirty\\" and \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" are more fun and sexy. Christina also talks about some of her past relationships in songs like \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Infatuation\\". This is a wonderful album. It's very personal, very private, and yet still fresh and exciting, just like X-tina. It's definitely her best album to date. Highly recommended.    Top 5 Tracks:  1. Cruz  2. Walk Away  3. Infatuation  4. Impssible  5. Loving Me 4 Me
B000TGCR38|4.0|\\"Black Book\\" is a fairly mesmerizing film that succeeds despite Paul Verhoeven's heavy hand.  For sure you like to be entertained but the gravity of World War II means any film depicting it's events, particularly those involving the plight of European Jews, should be dealt with sensitivity.  I mean this is not \\"Basic Instinct\\" or \\"Showgirls\\".  Was it necessary to show the film's heroine, a Jew working undercover for the Dutch Resistance, dying her pubic hair in semi-graphic detail?  Later we see prisoners who collaborated with the Germans dumping their excrement in a vat.  Wouldn't you know that moments later that vat's entire contents would be dumped on same heroine.  Steven Speilberg had nudity in \\"Schindler's List\\" but in a non-exploitive way.  You can't say the same here.  Despite these objections \\"Black Book\\" works because of it's intricate script that is a tangle of motives on all sides.  For instance, there are sympathetic Germans and duplicitous Resistance members.  There are moments where even the Jewish heroine is suspect.  Verhoeven had a hand in the script so I give him some plaudits there.  Star Carice van Outen is both radiant and compelling as Ellis.  If Verhoeven could have reigned in some of his compulsions this would have been a greater film.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is hands down the best show I have ever seen. For people who look at this and say \\"I don't like scary movies.\\" It's not scary. It's suspense. But if you do like scary movies you won't be disappointed either. There is no end to the ghosts, demons, vampires, werewolves, etc, etc, etc to keep you on your toes. Basically to give you a little insight, these 2 brothers are hunters of the supernatural. They travel all over the U.S. hunting and killing things. (Of course, there is more to it, but you'll have to watch.) Come on! Not gonna spoil it for you! Give this show a chance, you won't regret it!

B00008RH3L|4.0|\\"Miller's Crossing\\" Is best described as that \\"stylish Coen Bros. Gangster Movie\\".  Instead of the southwestern types populating \\"Raising Arizona\\" and \\"Blood Simple\\", we have the \\"Dapper Dans\\" and fast-talking molls of some nameless Prohibition-era metropolis.  Seething with an endless array of illicit dealing (speakeasies, bookmaking, fight-fixing), the city is barely held together by boss Lee O'Bannon (Albert Finney).  Even the Police Chief and the Mayor pay unquestioned deference to O'Bannon who, when times get desperate, proves he's still an artist with a Tommygun.  Nobody gets big without O'Bannon's permission, but the crime boss has a weakness - Verna Birnbaum (Marcia Gay Harden).      Lee's obsession with Verna proves fatal because he feels obligated to protect her no-good brother Bernie, an utter creep marked for death by lower crime boss Johnny Caspar.  Gabriel Byrne is Tommy Regan, Lee's right-hand man and also his conscience.  Regan cautions his boss to dump Verna - he knows that both she and her brother aren't worth going to war over.  But he's also fallen for Verna.  When O'Bannon ignores Tom, he sparks a mob war that soon threatens his primacy and catapults Caspar to the ultimate power.  Tom must navigate an uncertain path as Caspar's new confidante, one that brings him to blows with Caspar's right-hand man, and will see him realize his true feelings for Verna.    This was a great movie, with an uncommon sense of sound and visual artistry.  Putting aside the plot, full of characters with shifting motives, the Coens display their great ear for unforgettable dialog and expression.  Their never-named city manages to be more cartoonishly realized than those that appeared in the many Batman-clones that appeared in the early 1990's when \\"Crossing\\" was released.  The Coen's rely on their gift for visual irony - their city is populated with Cops who strut proudly even though conscious that they are tools of the bosses.  (In my favorite scene, Tom takes a chairto an oversized enforcer sent to rough him up; his \\"victim's\\" expression - like a child on the verge of tears - is priceless.)      At its heart, \\"Crossing\\" is an impossible mix of contradictions - with action both fast and slow, rough and smooth, heavy and light, best shown in a scene where Finney single-handedly turns the tables on would-be assassins, and the rat-a-tat of his submachine gun shares our attentions with the poignant sounds of \\"O Danny Boy\\".  Not quite the collection of sight-gags familiar in stock Coen fare like \\"Intolerable Cruelty\\" or \\"O' Brother\\", the film is best compared to a dream that Gabriel Byrne's character describes to Verna, of chasing his hat through the wind.  Byrne calls the sight of a grown man chasing something pathetic, but Verna thinks that hat an image that will change into something beautiful.  Even if you don't buy the story, the film's mix of imagery will prove unforgettable.

0792837614|5.0|Feeling fiendish? Then, by  all means,simply inject this movie's title into a quiet evening of conversation. Then sit back and listen to the arguments spew forth. For me, this is my favorite musical,even though I hated it in 1961 when I first saw it at age 13.I had absolutely no idea of what was going on.Since then, I've purchased several editions of the sound track and have found it to be first rate,as do most of my associates,It's the acting and dancing that seem to polarize people.                                Beymer is given the impossible simultaneous roles of inter-racial lover,reformed gang leader,peacemaker,impulsive killer,soda jerk,and Bobby Darin protege.Wood,for her part, gives a flat, emotionless performance. She and Beymer are as dispassionate together as Ozzie and Harriet. Enter Chakiris and Moreno to save the picture,( both winning well deserved Oscars). Bernardo (Chakiris) is the authentic embodiment of hate:he is hated as an \\"outsider\\" and is more than willing to return the favor.The fact that his complaints, sarcasms and hatreds of 1961 are essentially true (as in 2007)are of no consequence whatever. Moreno,meanwhile, immediately recognizes the danger that Wood's love for Tony (Beymer) embodies,but is willing to walk the \\"fine line\\" between intervention and advice until she is needlessly molested in the drug store anti- climax. Without question,this movie will always be debated.Unfortunately,the inherent plots and subplots are likely to remain the same in society, with the resultant  dark, dire consequences.

I found it to be honest, inspiring, and very entertaining. The India section was the hardest for me to stick through, but well written. I couldn't put it down!

B000N6TX1I|3.0|The Not-Too-Revealing Synopsis:    The near future finds us with no more children; infertility plagues humankind.  Britain has become a military state and deportation of illegal immigrants is a top priority.  A woman appears promising an optimistic future but no one knows what exactly to do with her promise.    Review:    The premise of the movie is fantastic.  Unfortunately the movie is more about the military state, its' pogrom against illegals and the ensuing rebellion than it is an exploration of a world without children.  It shirks its' science fiction obligation to ask puzzling questions and satisfies itself with a feature length chase scene through a dystopia.  In spite of the missed opportunities this created world is a fascinating place to watch the action take place.  I think most will find the movie somewhat unsatisfying but it is still worth a watch.
B000UR9QGW|4.0|To sum it up. There are not many good old classic horror/gore flicks on blu ray. So my Evil Dead II is very warm and welcome in my collection. Sure most of it is dark and a bit grainy at times but its still sharper then any dvd I've seen of it. The close ups on ash you can really see the improvement. $20 is a very good price too I think. For a true fan there is even any decision to make here. I also purchased Dawn Of the Dead at the same time and DOTD does indeed look better, but then again most of DOTD is filmed in better lighting. Go get it you gore hounds!
B000UJ48U4|5.0|To take yourself from the state of bewilderment to seasoned artistic critic after watching this film, do yourself a favor and read the following essays. They will expand your ability to comprehend other films on deeper levels as well, levels that may not have been accessible to you before.    As an english major, they have helped me immensely in developing additional critical faculties.    This movie will predictably frustrate Joe and Jane Sixpack, but will richly reward those who are able to distinguish between the postmodern, recycled rubbish, that hollywood is cranking out ad nauseam, and painstakingly crafted art such as this.    Kubrick did not \\"lose it\\" by the time of this film, as some have claimed. EWS is just as carefully thought out as his other films, with multiple motifs waiting to be discovered for the patient and attentive--nothing is left to chance, even the Sociology textbook, carefully placed on prostitute Domino's desk!    Google these as I don't think links are allowed:    1) An essay by Jamie Stuart eyes wide shut movienavigator    2) Introducing Sociology A Review of Eyes Wide Shut by Tim Kreider    Please refrain from reviewing the film without a basic knowledge of such things as symbolism, history, and sociology.    So put on your mask and cloak, and enjoy the film!
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|I'll be brief: huge Lennox/ Eurythmics fan since 1983 or so. SOMD is quite good, but tends to fall into cheesy at times. Also, it is way too personal to be given such a big title, should have been :Me, me, me and the destruction around me\\". \\"Womankind\\" might just be the worst song Annie has ever written. And \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" shows that Annie really shines with detached, aloof sound. I am not listening to this CD as a whole as much as I do to her other work, but I do hum many of the songs from it all day long :)
B000TGJ80S|5.0|This film is one of the most visually stunning stylized films ever to grace the screen and actually uses melodrama to its advantage.  Melodrama is fatal to many films, but not in this case.  This rendition of Dracula along with Mulholland drive, is one of my all-time favourites (I've seen at least 5000 films).    This film reminds me of the medieval Czar Lazar of Serbia, who belonged to the Sacred Order of the Dragon of Saint George.  Lazar was in legion with Vlad Dracolya, Prince of Wallachia, who this movie is about.  Together they fought the murderous, colonial and despicable Turks who eventually paid a dear price for their escapades into the Balkans.  To this day, Serbia still bears the scars of 500 years of Turk slavery.  Reminds me of the Israelite bondage in Egypt. As Dracula says in the movie, \\"it is no laughing matter!\\"    There's a lot of controversy over which color scheme is correct, this or the previous release dvd's. But it appears that despite what the superbit fanboys claim, this new transfer is how it appeared in theaters in 1990--at least that is what film legend Mr. Harris says. Also, it is approved by Coppola whereas neither the standard, nor superbit version was.    Will comment in a few days how it looks.    I wish more people commented on how the DVD looks and sounds as opposed to just posting subjective views whether they liked the movie or not. This is a new transfer, and people know what the movie is about.    ------------------------------------------------------    UPDATE !!!    Well, I've finally gotten around to posting a full review on the quality of the transfer for the collector's edition. I heard of some people that felt it may be a tad dark compared to earlier versions but I would like to dispel that myth.  What we had in previous versions was a made for TV transfer that drastically altered everything from colours to contrast. The result was that it did not have the intended artistic effect that Coppola sought. Copplola has gone onthe record that this is the way the film was intended to be seen.    I am amazed at the depth of black levels as well as the detail that exists, even beyond the superbit version.     The soundtrack is on par with the previous DTS track on the superbit version, and I think it has been remastered as well--close call though.    Anyone with a properly calibrated set and DVD player that is able to pass \\"blacker than black,\\" will find this new transfer a revelation.    The different visual presentation will have an immediate affect on your overall interpretation of the film. Film is after all very much about MOOD and visual presentation. This is something that Kubrick understood so well about 2001 space odyssey, which dispensed with dialogue in most of the scenes--forcing you to absorb the film on a primal level.    This edition, in a dark room, causes me to enter a trance, whereas the others, could not.    Disk 2 supplementals are also first rate! I bought it for that reason alone and was surprised by the great transfer.

0061124265|5.0|I picked up this book upon the recommendation of a friend, and finished it in less than a day. I can't remember the last time a piece of literature touched me so much. Thank God this is a slim paperback and relatively inexpensive, because I'm buying up several copies to distribute to friends whose perspective on life is in a state of flux.<br /><br />\\"Veronika Decides To Die\\" is the story of an intelligent young woman who lives according to society's expectations. She is dutiful to her parents, respectful to others, goes to church.... and she wants to die, because a life governed by the expectations of others is a farce, and has reduced her to a breathing marionette. She overdoses on sleep aids, ends up in a Slovenian mental hospital, and is informed that irreversible damage has been done to her heart. She has five days to live at the most.<br /><br />These allotted days turn out to be the only time in her life that she truly LIVES. Artistically, sexually, emotionally, she plunges into a series of explorations and adventures that allow her to become an independent being and not the product of societal expectations. While not advocating anarchy, author Coelho uses Veronika's journey to illustrate that total compliance with external demands doesn't only regulate existance- it also strips it of meaning.<br /><br />Through the character of the hospital's chief medical officer, Dr. Igor, Coelho introduces the concept of a silent emotional killer called Vitriol. This phenomenon, which takes its name from a poison favored in medieval times by emperors, kings, and disenchanted lovers, sets in when, according to Coehlo, sufferers \\"build exaggeratedly high defenses against the outside world.... and leave their inner world stripped bare. It is there that bitterness begins its irrevocable work.\\" Sufferers like Veronika find social rebels \\"a perennial source of fascination, for they... will forge ahead regardless of what other people say... and the embittered would spend many days and nights remarking on the absurdity and the glory (of their actions).\\" Like my friend, singer Pete Burns, once remarked, \\"When you go your own way, you become a mirror for other people's insecurities.\\" He's right. I was guilty of the same tunnel vision before I unshackled myself.<br /><br />I defy anyone to read \\"Veronika Decides To Die\\" and come away feeling the same about so-called normalcy. While Paulo Coelho does not, as previously stated, advocate anarchy and endangerment of one's self or others, he does encourage readers, through Veronika's example, to live each minute as if it might be your last, and treat your life like the precious gift it is.g on the absurdity and the glory (of their actions).\\" Like my friend, singer Pete Burns, once remarked, \\"When you go your own way, you become a mirror for other people's insecurities.\\" He's right.

B000001ESN|4.0|This is part two of a comprehensive four part series of Music Reviews of the Progressive Rock band Rush.  When a band has been around as long as RUSH has (30 years), their styles will change just as their clothing and hairstyles.  I group the bands second five releases into what I call their \\"Mid-Era Progressive\\" phase.  These albums include: A Farewell to Kings (1977), Hemispheres (1978), Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981) and Exit Stage Left \\"Live\\" (1981)<br /><br />Well, it's officially the 80's, and Geddy begins to integrate synthesizers into more and more Rush songs.  Permanent Waves offers one of Rush's most \\"radio-friendly\\" songs ever, The Spirit of Radio.  Waves offers the most diverse track listing ever put on one album.  Jacobs Ladder and Natural Science continue the lengthy epic prog-rock tradition.  Alex begins to experiment with a more textured guitar sound that complements Geddy's synthesizer parts.<br /><br />Permanent Waves is a very good album, and a good lead-up to Moving Pictures.  Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, and Exit Stage Left represent Rush at the pinnacle of their musical career.  They won't be as commercially accepted ever again as they are in the early 80's.<br /><br />Best Tracks: Spirit of Radio and Freewill
B000V8I2QU|5.0|These guys are not getting older, their getting better and smarter. Just listen to the words to \\"Magic\\", while thinking of our current crop of presidential wanna-bes. Bruce is again banging away with all 8 cylinders, and Clarence has never sounded better. On \\"Radio Nowhere\\" it sounds like Max is destroying his drum kit. This cd lives in my car and probably will stay till the next E-Street album. Hey Bruce, keep it up , brother!

Moving Pictures is Rush's most popular album.  That's between both Rush fans and your average rock music enthusiast.  It contains some of the band's most well known songs that actually got air-play back in the day!  It contains such classic songs as Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, and Limelight.  But, don't make the mistake of thinking this album is just a bunch of radio-friendly pop tunes, quite the contrary.  Moving Pictures is a very approachable modern progressive rock album disguised as an Adult Oriented Rock (AOR) album.  It's got Rush's second, and probably most popular instrumental, YYZ, and the last of the long, extended-length rock tracks, The Camera Eye, coming in at almost 11 minutes.<br /><br />Oh, the best part? This piece of classic rock is now available at bargain basement prices. Go and buy it for friend as a introduction to this great band.  Highly Recommended to all.<br /><br />Best Tracks: Tom Sawyer and Red Barchetta
B000002ITM|5.0|I know alot of people were not happy with this cd, comparing it to Judas Priest's \\"Turbo\\" album, but IMO it's a very good cd, yes it's mellower than LOW and The Gathering, but it's still an awesome effort, Electric Crown is one of my favorite songs, The Ritual and Return to Serenity are simply awesome, great melodic metal. anyway just give it a listen and if your a fan of Heavy Metal it's worth the investment.

B000AGTPUK|5.0|I rented this movie for my 3 year old and she was captivated, as so was I.  It's a great christmas family movie.  I love the production!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I'm going to cut to the chase here (pun intended), keep this short and sweet.    This movie is fantastic. You're going to be thrilled, believe me.  The movie is about a Stuntman called Mike Mckay and his special death proof car. The action sequences are extremely visceral and well made, made for real with no CGI and fake crap.    A lot of people complain about the dialogs, of course in usual Tarantino manner, but I taught it was pretty awesome and it don't affect the pace of the movie. On the contrary, I was entertained during the whole time.    Kurt Russell is outstanding in his role and just watching him act will worth the price of admission. He was, of course, the right choice for the role. As most critics said he's having a lot of fun and playing around with his cinema icon status. You can feel his presence during the whole movie, and he actually is almost in every scene...you can see him several times in the background of some key talking scenes.    I was actually rooting for him the whole movie and was sad when HE DIED with his head smashed by Rosario Dawson's character Abernathy (Abbie).  He should have killed all girls...but most people actually said that they laughed in the ending.    Especially Kim (Tracie Thoms). He should have ran over her head and splattered her brain on the road.
1416523359|3.0|<spoiler warning>    I wasn't sure how to review this book. On the one hand, the good parts are brilliant. On the other hand, the flaws pretty much broke this book for me.    First, the bad stuff.  1. About 5% of this book seems to be quotations from various authors, musicians, etc. The quotes from Hank Williams (aka \\"Ole Hank\\") were enough to make me wish King would just knock it off (strap it on?) and use *his* words to tell *his* story instead of borrowing other people's. That's what an author is supposed to do, isn't it? If I want to read song lyrics, I'll buy the CD, thanks. I can't think of a single quote that illuminated the text or enhanced this book. They could all have been edited out with no loss to this reader.    2. Lisey's behavior. Another reviewer mentioned Lisey's reaction to finding a dead cat in her mailbox. For me, it is utterly unbelievable that any person would make this discovery and think, \\"Oh well, he's just messing around. I'm sure he'd never do anything like that to *me*. I might as well just scream at him over the phone and tell him to smuck off. That'll make him go away.\\"  This is the same Lisey who *knows* what crazy psycho fans of her husband's work are capable of (or has she succumbed to the temporary amnesia she appears to suffer from periodically in this book and forgotten about that man who shot her husband?)  Then when the pyscho stalker is torturing her, I can't help thinking, \\"Well, duh. What did you think he was going to do to you, you idiot?\\" She had plenty of time, opportunity and money to protect herself from this predictable event and to prevent this from happening, but (because the plot requires it) she \\"decides\\" (i.e. the author decides) to leave herself vulnerable to him. Then, when she's lying mutilated in her husband's study, possibly bleeding to death and the deputy calls up the stairs to see if she's okay. She calls back down and says, yes she is. Because why? Oh yeah, the plot requires it of her.  Her sister mutilates herself. Does she immediately call an ambulance to have her taken to a hospital for her own protection? Well, no. She and her other sister clean her up and put her bed. Because why? That smucking plot-thing again.  Are the female characters believable? They're not believable as people to me, let alone as women (despite the interminable references to Lisey's bras). I've never had a sister, but these \\"sisterly\\" relationships seem to border on the women being pests to each other (except for Lisey, who is just generally better and more mature and together and everything than all of her sisters--in the author's opinion) except when the plot requires them to suddenly get along swimmingly, all grudges forgotten. Note to King: Women tend to hold grudges longer than men.).    3. Twenty-five years of marriage and just one fight (before they're married, he arrives late for a date and she reams him out. He cuts himself up and all's right with the world and they get engaged.). Why? Because they love each other more than any couple in the world ever has before.   He might be selling it, but I'm not buying it.    4. I bought this book assuming it was a mainstream novel. I was completely thrown when, well into the book, the spec-fic element suddenly appears (Scott's ability to travel to an alternate world). I guess I'm just used to reading spec-fic and assumed that the conventions of the genre are hard-and-fast rules. If the story is spec-fic, you let the reader know up front. Otherwise, the book comes off as being a bit of a whacked-out hybrid that isn't sure what it is.    The above might give the impression that I hated this book. I didn't. There were parts of it that I loved. There are little flashes of the kind of amazing writing that made me want to get out a highlighter and mark them so I could read them again. You know, the writer-envy green-gilled jealousy kind of passages.    King's portrayal of the relationship between Scott and his brother and father was genuinely moving. There's a big idea at the heart of this book that just verged on blowing me away. Almost enough to make me overlook the rest of the book's flaws. But not quite.    I would give this book a conditional recommendation to friends: If you don't mind occasional irrational behavior/characters, don't mind skipping over quotations, and you want to get your head into a really cool idea, buy this book.
0595440096|5.0|As much as this book broke my heart, I simply could not put it down. I was continually struck by its utter lack of melodrama where many authors would have worked the same subject (Alzheimer's) using such a ruse. One is drawn inside Alice's world seamlessly, brought to understand how she maintains her essential self even as she is diminished by the disease. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Halberstam's research and interviews help illuminate the people and their respective impacts for his readers; thus, helping make known and clear what wasn't prior.  Perhaps the greatest historical record of the nation for most of the last half of the 20th century.  The question that arises after having read this is, Can any author manage to produce the same caliber of writing from the end of Viet Nam onward?

0143038583|4.0|This is certainly not your Mother's cookbood.  In fact, it's not a cookbook at all, nor is it intended to be.  It examines, in very fine detail, the way we used to eat, and what exactly constututes the primary food we eat today.  Just what is this stuff called food?   It fills American supermarket shelves...seemingly from floor to  ceiling.  Much of it is based on one crop - including the packaging.  Is it a healthy diet?  It's certainly not what our bodies were designed to consume.   A dilemma, to be sure, but also a facinating examination of our nation's food business.  The key word is business, not to be confused with nourshment.  It's a good read.  If you're really interested in learning where our staple food originated, and the many ways it is being used today, you won't regret learning about \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\".
B0000714B5|4.0|Read the book first, but don't miss this film!    This film does not fully depict the growth of Siddhartha over time, but it does depict an India that is no longer there. Plus! The music and song used in the film does very much to add flavor to the film. For example, there is an actual group of blind, roving singers that were used in the film that made their living thru song.  Cinematography is excellent as well. (Many of the scenes were filmed on a Raja's private preserves that are not open to the public eye.    The story abridgement is disquieting especially since the film is so short (less than 90 minutes) an additional half hour could have made a great difference in fleshing out Siddhartha. This should have been a 2½ hour film.    All said however, I do not regret buying the DVD. I have been searching and waiting for its re-release since 1971. In the theatre in 1971, I was so moved by the music that my eyes were teary with an inner joy that I had never experienced before or since. A MUST SEE!
B000URDEB0|3.0|I wasn't expecting much from the new Nightwish after I heard some early releases of the new vocalist before the new album hit the US.  To me, they don't sound that different from Within Temptation, and if I wanted that, I'd just listen to Within Temptation.  There were two elements that made me fall in love with Nightwish: The music and Tarja's voice.  The combination was original, refreshing, and unlikened anywhere. To me both parts were of equal magnitude.  With Tarja gone, only half of the Nightwish I loved is still there.  While the lyrics are good, the music somehow sounds more pop on this one than their previous releases.  I don't think the new singer has a bad voice, but it shouldn't be in Nightwish in my opinion.  They had a successful template that got them international acclaim, and why they had to change the whole template is beyond me.  That's their business!

The perfect blend of black and white drawings with increasing details and the captivating story line totally intrigued my son. He remembered all the little details that I'd forget and kept reminding me in the evening that it was time for us to read another chapter. After we finished it last night, he asked me - is there a Book TWO of Hugo Cabret, maybe called the Magics of Hugo Cabret, he suggested, is it coming out next year?   Now it will be hard for me to find a book to match this one.
B000EXZI1Y|5.0|\\"Still Waters\\" closed out the Century as the Bee Gees last studio album.

B000V801PK|5.0|It is certainly heartening to know that any day Annie Lennox decides to step into the recording studio, she'll be able to delight her fans and the world with her words and melody.<br /><br />Dark Road opens with its sunken melancholic before breaking into a rapturous bridge then closing with the quiet calm it began with. Such is a display of the multitudes of emotion Lennox is capable of packing in. On songs like Womankind and the archetypical anti-HIV/AIDS tribute, Lennox attempts to sing about female empowerment and knowledge, resulting in two gorgeous anthems. The latter, ambitiously includes the backing vocals of 23 female artists and a resounding sign-off that features a short African interlude. On other tracks (Big Sky, Lost), Lennox touches on love, loss, and hurt like no one else ever knew.<br /><br />At her most experimental, Lennox shows her mastery. Through the Glass Darkly (probably inspired by Jostein Gaarder) begins like a piece of Zero 7 while Coloured Bedspread is a damn fine electronic synth track destined for the clubs.<br /><br />Of course, Lennox's deep haunting voice is never compromised throughout the album.<br /><br />If there's one album (along with Feist's The Reminder and Radiohead's In Rainbow) you have to listen to in 2007, Songs of Mass Destruction is the one that serves to add some soul into music.<br /><br />The Deluxe edition includes extensive commentary of each song by Lennox herself as well as the video for Dark Road. If you get the Barnes and Noble exclusive edition, there's two bonus tracks - the acoustic version of Dark Road which features an entirely different arrangement to the original and Don't Take Me Down. Worth the money for fans.(A)
6305313687|4.0|American History X is the story of two brothers who become involved in a racist gang who believes minorities are rotting America's culture.   Derek, who is played by Edward Norton, becomes the leader of the gang.  Early on, two black kids attempt to steal his car late at night and he ends up killing them both.  The film uses black and white to depict the period before Derek is released from prison and color for after he is released.  This is a clever way of showing that during the black and white portion, Derek is only judging people by the color of their skin, while during the colored portion he begins to see it's not that simple.     Danny, his younger brother, views Derek as a mentor and tries to follow in his footsteps.  When Derek is released from prison, he is very confused and angry with Derek's new views on racism and discrimination. Derek also has two sisters and a mother who appears to be very sick, but the illness is never mentioned.  Three years later after Derek is released from prison, Derek wants to set things right with his family and get them away from the life he has forced them into.  Towards the end of the film, Sweeny, a principle at Danny's school and Derek's former teacher asks for his help.  Derek is reluctant, but knows he needs to do this to be a good role model for Danny.  Sweeny seems to act as the underlying insinuative both Danny and Derek need to set themselves strait.    The plot itself has a few questionable areas.  Derek's three years in prison seem rushed and underdeveloped at some points.  Another 10 minutes of content in that area would have made it much less choppy.  Derek meets a black co-worker in prison who he alienates himself from at first, but later opens up to him.  Eventually, the two become friends and Derek admits he couldn't have made it through prison without him.  This relationship helps Derek question his prejudice and change his ways.  Even if there were a few weak scenes, it definitely does not detract from the films overall experience.   From a technical standpoint the filming and camera angles were spot on.  The background music helped capture the mood of each scene and most of the time I didn't even notice it was there.  This can be good or bad depending on the person, but it didn't bother me.   Almost all of the scenes have great acting; although, a few seemed a bit awkward.  The first that comes to mind is a scene towards the end of the film where Derek is talking to Danny outside school before he turns his paper in.  The whole scene just didn't feel right, but maybe that's just me.  Other than that everything was very well done.   The film as a whole is a very powerful experience and leaves you with questions of your own.  Norton couldn't have played his role any better than he did and his supporting cast followed right in his footsteps.  The film certainly shows us in a crystal clear fashion what human hatred and jealously can lead to.  Sure there are few shortcomings, but I still will wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone looking for a well structured and powerful film.

B000GG4946|5.0|At long last, the Brothers Gibb have crafted an album that surpasses all their earlier efforts. The sound is more basic (less synthesizer) and more mature (simplifying all their talents). The range is varied, but always maintains an upbeat, rock filled tempo. \\"She Keeps On Coming\\" and \\"Voice In The Wilderness\\" are amazing surprises of excellent R & B rock. Is this the Bee Gees? Even the ballads are mainstream upbeat, such as, \\"Wedding Day\\", \\"Embrace\\" and the oddly named, \\"Loose Talk, Costs Lives\\". Although, the title track has been chosen as the first single (in the rest of the World), any track could make it, (save for \\"Technicolor Dreams\\", which is a pleasant, but odd novelty song). Maurice even tops himself with the Beach Boys styled \\"Man In The Middle\\" and \\"Walking On Air\\". There are lots of surprises here and there is absolutely no way to try and pick which songs will be chosen for air-play. They are all that good.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|It is certainly heartening to know that any day Annie Lennox decides to step into the recording studio, she'll be able to delight her fans and the world with her words and melody.<br /><br />Dark Road opens with its sunken melancholy before breaking into a rapturous  bridge then closing with the quiet calm it began with. Such is a display of the multitudes of emotion Lennox is capable of packing in. On songs like Womankind and the archetypical anti-HIV/AIDS tribute, Lennox attempts to sing about female empowerment and knowledge, resulting in two gorgeous anthems. The latter, ambitiously includes the backing vocals of 23 female artists and a resounding sign-off that features a short African interlude. On other tracks (Big Sky, Lost), Lennox touches on love, loss, and hurt like no one else ever knew.<br /><br />At her most experimental, Lennox shows her mastery. Through the Glass Darkly (probably inspired by Jostein Gaarder)begins like a piece of Zero 7 while Coloured Bedspread is a damn fine electronic synth track destined for the clubs.<br /><br />Of course, Lennox's deep haunting voice is never compromised throughout the album.<br /><br />If there's one album (along with Feist's The Reminder and Radiohead's In Rainbow) you have to listen to in 2007, Songs of Mass Destruction is the one that serves to add some soul into music. (A)
0143038583|5.0|This is a must read for anyone concerned about our food supply -- or for those who just enjoy an enjoyable story.  Don't let the title fool you.  Though it's clever, to me it seemed to herald a dry read.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I had trouble putting this book down.  Pollan is the perfect storyteller.  His prose is personal and funny. He takes the potentially dull topic of our food chain and turns it into one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time, as well as one of the most educational.  Well researched and detailed, this book will open your eyes to what has happened to our food chain in just a few short decades. If his section on corn doesn't make you think twice before entering a drive-thru or the middle aisles of the grocery, nothing will.
B000003TBP|4.0|Beck's a pretty eclectic artist.  He raps, sings, does folky songs, rock, and a lot of weird stuff.  He samples a bunch of artists on Odelay, and puts all the sounds together to create an album that is both wide ranging and still cohesive in the unique sum of its parts.  There are a variety of instruments used and no song sounds much like any other.  I don't know how much of it can really be attributed to Beck and how much credit you really have to give to the original artists he borrows from so heavily, which is part of the reason I'm not totally huge on it.  Even if he's not responsible for some of the music though, he still put it all together, made plenty of instrumentation on his own, and did all the vocal stuff.  The songs are transformed to fit into his style, so it's not just like he took a riff he liked and sang or rapped over it.    The album starts with a great guitar part and trademark repetitive-yet-catchy chorus in \\"Devil's Haircut\\".  The next track, \\"Hotwax\\" has an odd mix of country guitar and electronic scratching.  \\"The New Pollution\\" is a nice song with some eccentric noises and a smooth sax part sprinkled in.  \\"Novacane\\" tricks you into thinking it's going to be mellow before busting into the cooler, hard center of the song.  \\"Where It's At\\" is the single everyone knows, a pretty enjoyable rap-heavy song.  \\"Minus\\" is probably the fastest-paced song, and a pretty good one.  \\"High 5 (Rock the Catskills)\\" is one of the stranger tracks, and fairly wandering.  \\"Ramshackle\\" is another acoustic, slower song to cap off the album in fine form.  There isn't that much about Odelay that's truly amazing, but it's a completely solid and enjoyable record the whole way through.
B000UJBYD8|4.0|One thing I've found after being a Cult fan for over 20 years is that they don't do anything twice.  They create a different mood with every album that they release.      After reading the reviews for 'Born into This', I was a little sad with the prospect of seeing a new album that wouldn't stack up to their other albums.  That being said, I have to admit that I have been pleasantly surprised at how much I like it.  I found it hard to connect with a few of the songs but most of them rock.  A little funky nostalgia and a little heavy fluidity.  This is good stuff.
B000URDEB0|2.0|When the members of Nightwish fired Tarja I was saddened but then these guys spent a whole year scouring the earth looking for a new singer, so how could they go wrong. Boy was I wrong! This is the best singer they could find? The idiotic tv series \\"American Idol\\" pumps out better singers each year. The music on \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is fantastic indeed but new singer Anette Olzon's average voice gets run over & buried by the bombastic music on this album song after song & it doesnt help that this album has the worst mastering ever heard by human ears. Terrible! What seperated Nightwish from all the other female fronted symphonic metal bands was Tarja's voice. Nightwish now sounds like Within Temptation except not as good. Tarja, you are truly missed!    R.I.P. Nightwish
B00000B9BD|5.0|back in my 7th or 8th grade days, when i first started buying albums, i recall the strawbs were a regular feature in all the cut-out bins i went through. i'm pretty sure that i bought one of their recordings for 99 cents or something, and i probably listened to it at least once, but being a little retard, it left no impression. well, many a year later, i have given \\"grave new world\\" a go, and it certainly has left an impression. great prog-folk-rock. a pinch of genesis, a dash of procol harum, a touch of cat stevens, and a whole lot of other stuff. a great album. i need to get more strawbs.
0060578793|3.0|I think this book is very good for certain situations, but I feel that it does not meet the needs of most average folks in case of major catastrophy.     I would recommend Ron Foster's practical guide for all scenarios. Since he works in the field of emergency response, he has the most up to date and useful methods of urban and rural survival.    If you seriously want to learn more than \\"how to live off the land\\" short term, I would highly recommend Mr. Foster's publication, \\"The Rural Ranger: A Suburban Manual & Field Guide of Traps and Snares for Food and Survival\\".    I know how to live off the land if one can even get to such a ideal location, but hunger, thirst and the elements will wear out the millions of people trying to vacate their huge cities all at once.     This book gives one a fighting chance no matter what your skills are or where you live.    Seriously,  David Highum
B000RG1FMO|5.0|way better than curtis. amazing all around. I liked every song, the only song that could have been better was barry bonds, because Weezy is the best rapper alive, it could have been a better beat.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO OF STEVIE !  I REALLY ENJOYED IT, AS SHE ADDS HER INSIGHT INTO EVERY VIDEO.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|Bruce is pushing 60 and he still writes better songs than anybody else these days. That is as much a compliment to Bruce as it is a major rip on today's music. This album is good but I agree with many about the mediocre sound of this album - if you have a nice system you will hear how bad the sound is immediately. No excuses and it cost him a few stars. Plus, the ESB has always been more attitude than talent - they need better mixing than this. Mostly good songs here, with great lyrics. Bruce is always good for a few cheesy tunes and doesnt disappoint with the likes of Summer Clothes -he was going for Brian Wilson but gave us Mike Love instead. Bermuda, Bahamas....
B00005JKQ6|5.0|This is one of the best movies you've never heard of.  I found the VHS in a bargain bin at about 2 a.m. in a Ralph's in LA.  For $1.29 or whatever, it was sure worth a shot to get an obscure Burt Lancaster movie.<br /><br />\\"Neddie\\" (Lancaster) gets this wacky idea to make a river out of his neighbors' swimming pools and swim home from the \\"source,\\" the first stop on his pool-to-pool tour.  At this home, Ned is greeted as a beloved friend, invited for cocktails, etc.  At the next house, the greeting isn't so warm.  And so on.  By the end of his expedition down the \\"River Lucinda\\" (as Ned calls it, in honor of his wife), the neighbors he encounters are seething with hatred toward him.  He seems to not have a clue why.<br /><br />I have had a mild version of this experience.  At the neighborhood gas station I frequented, I was accused of stealing a squeegie.  I had been on friendly terms with the owner and his wife for years, but suddenly they were openly hateful.  Had they really disliked me all along and only now showed their true feelings?  So I know just how poor Ned was feeling on his sad journey home.<br /><br />This dreamlike, surreal movie, is noteworthy for another reason:  Joan Rivers!  In the midst of a hoity-toity party (especially scorching for poor Ned) you spot a young woman who looks familiar.  Can that be Joan Rivers? Yes, it's Joan in a small speaking part.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|This is the Australian print titled Mad Max 2. The aspect ratio appears a bit wider than The Road Warrior release on DVD. The film begins with the most striking and engaging narrative ever put to celluloid and moves right into our anti-hero battling to survive an attack by the psychotics who own the highways. PQ is stunning. There is detail and color here never before seen. Best up-grade from DVD to BD picture I have ever seen! SQ is impressive as well. Great sound track, tense musical score and strong delivery by 5.1 on a very early 80's film. Directed by George Miller, this is one of the greatest action/car chase and carnage films ever made. You will be blown away by this on blu-ray and highly recommend getting this title.
0316166685|3.0|I liked this book, and found it a quick and easy read.  I really liked the way the author sucks you in at the first chapter and quickly establishes the story.    I was disappointed about the ending and the way it wraps up so clunky.  I didn't like the \\"down to earth\\" moment and except for that, it was so realistic.
B000062Y98|5.0|Blind Guardian is one of those bands that I can listen to endlessly and never get bored of their music. The release of their \\"Night At The Opera\\" CD just strengthens that - the choral singing and the feel of being in an opera or in a majestic sort of place of happiness and thrill - that's a good feeling! I love listening to all Blind Guardian CDs in general but this CD has a really powerful feel with the layered vocals and guitars - like an army or something at full force! There's no stopping these guys even with their 20 year career! This album's also been acclaimed well by magazines and such so that's key in factor letting you know you must get this!
B00027JYLC|5.0|I love this film.  It's one of Tod Browning's best films (along with his work with Lon Chaney), and it's one of the most memorable films ever made in any country or genre.  Most people make a lot of hay over the casting of real \\"freaks\\" (I really dislike that term), that Browning was being exploitative.  I don't feel he was at all.  Browning really shows the \\"freaks\\" to be funny, flawed, silly, cruel, and, well, human (which they are).  The ones who are the most heartless are the so-called \\"normal\\" ones, the trapeze artist who seduces the little man Hans for his money, and her hulky lover.  They look normal but who are the real freaks inside.  The \\"one of us\\" scene is as intense as you have heard, and the finale is one of the most disturbing and suspenseful in film history.  The acting isn't the greatest here (many of the \\"freaks\\" are not professional actors), but it doesn't detract from the power of the film.  This film was rarely screened after its debut (a lot of people were genuinely terrified of it), but now it's readily available, which is a good thing.  It's one of the best horror films ever made, and one of the most humanistic ones as well.
B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula is so superior to so many versions of the Dracula movies I have seen. I seem to appreciate and enjoy each and everyone ever made. But this has some real meat to it. It never ceases to amaze me about blu. I swear on so many movies I have watched over and over again on DVD and then on blu... its like seeing it for the first time. This movie is no exception. PQ has been carefully scrutinized for the BD release by Copalla, so I have no complaints. It is as he has intended. Good enough for me. In individual scenes, it will appear to be overly red/brown saturated, or on the gold side, but when you see the entire movie, you will realize it is solid. Blacks are solid, colors are intentionally muted to a small degree but there are some scenes where the colors will come out and grab you from time to time. PQ detail is slightly softer overall than top reference BDs and grain is only what was released in the theater. Very satisfied after numerous negative reviews by the pros. You will see their point though if you did not know that Copalla supervised it all the way thru. OK.... SQ! WOW! I have to make the same old tired but happy to announce comment that the PCM track is Magnificent. Detailed sounds never before heard, Good forward Voice track, Powerful and dynamic when things heat up! Amazing! After the blu experience of watching this movie (again), it really was the first time I have seen it after all. Superb all the way! Highly recommended!
B00000DQSV|5.0|Notorious is a phenomenal work of art.  I bought and heard their first record, I had heard Rio before that and I thought it was amazing.  I decided to buy their 1986 Notorious not knowing what to expect.  Duran Duran's Notorious surpassed all my expectation; of the three records I've heard from this group, this album is easily the strongest.  It is mature and refined yet still fresh and edgy. It is a great record throughout; here they have created realms in music previously unknown.  I'm blown away - five stars.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Alright well pretty much all you've got here is the music for the musical episode of Buffy \\"Once More With Feeling.\\" I really recommend this simply for anyone who really enjoyed the scores from the episodes and wants to listen to them without the lengthy scenes and that stuff. Haha I loved the episode so much I got the CD, and I enjoy listening to it as much as I like watching the episode! I'm such a Buffy nerd XD Well if you're interested in listening to the album without the visuals then get this!
0143038419|5.0|I was given this book as a gift, and for that I couldn't be more grateful.  I am one of the readers who never wanted the book to end.  I loved it and felt a close connection with the author.  The fact that she was sharing her innermost thoughts and feelings with refreshing honesty helped make the connection stronger.         Even though I understood that not everyone would connect with this book, I have to say I was surprised at the intense feelings of those who disliked the book.  I wonder what they were reacting to.  (Some admit they didn't even get through the first section.) It's a shame because they missed so much... a beautifully spiritual book.  I guess they just didn't get it. But... we are where we are.         Obviously, I give this book my highest recommendation.  I just bought three more copies: one for my daughter, and two for close friends (I couldn't bear to part with mine)
B000OVLBIU|4.0|I bought this movie sight unseen, so I wasn't expecting too much. I liked it! No, its not a great movie but found it very entertaining! Great comic book tie in with the Ghost Rider on a horse from the old west and the present day Ghost Rider with a chopper that puts any bike from American Chopper to shame! Wait till you see this thing! Amazing design. The special effects on the evil characters are very well done and a bit creepy. This unrated edition would probably give the youngsters nightmares. But for the rest of us, we can handle a bad dream or two right?! PQ is Beautiful. Solid blacks, colors and exceptional detail. SQ is superior as well. 5 stars on both. Recommended for an enjoyable BD example and pure entertainment fun!
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|\\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is perhaps the most depressing American film ever created. I try to search my knowledge for something more depressing, but nothing comes even close.     That said, I don't see how anyone can watch that movie more than once without being a masochist. However, the score here is probably just as addictive and encapsulating as the drugs that destroyed the characters in the movie.     Like many film soundtracks, it consists of a few small snippets of music and a few behomouth 'overtures.' Standouts include \\"Summer Overture,\\" \\"The Beginning of the End,\\" \\"Meltdown\\" and \\"Lux Aeterna.\\" But if you look at the album as a whole, the way it's divided, you have three huge movements: Summer, Fall and Winter.     Now, you can certainly pull aside \\"Summer Overture\\" and \\"Lux Aeterna\\" out and listen to them individually if you want to get a good dose of the haunting violin hook. However, this is an album that in order to fully enjoy, you have to listen to it all at once, or at least by the three divisions. It's the easiest cd to listen to all the way through that I've ever bought.     If you love classical music, scary electronica or want something explore the nether regions of your mind with--;)--this is an excellent album for you!
B000ROALCG|2.0|I read the reviews and find myself asking, what did viewers really focus on when they saw El Cantante? I can tell you that Marc did nothing good to the image of Lavoe. Now, the non spanish viewers were presented with \\"another spanish junkie\\". Thanks, Marc. Hector was a human being with his demons and weaknesses. Thank you, Marc.    I will say that the sound of the soundtrack is superb! The music itself deserves 5 stars. It does sound good and is refined per today's standards. But that is where it all ends. You want to experience Lavoe, then buy Hector's CD's and enjoy the legend.     You liked the movie, then go ahead and buy this CD. But if you want to know who Hector \\"Lavoe\\" Perez really was all about, then look away from this page and type \\"Hector Lavoe\\" in your next search.
B000H7J9QM|4.0|Just picked this up and at the risk of sounding too technical... \\"WOW\\"! A far better movie than I was expecting. Granted, the cars are amazing etc, etc, but lets review the movie. You do not by any means have to be a car buff to enjoy this movie. Kind of like Field of dreams. Don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate that one either. Some very good characters here, both good and bad to enjoy. Our hero is getting pressure from all sides and up and down as well. A nice script and tight directing. Practically non-stop excitement. Cage's character has to \\"acquire\\" 50 of the hottest cars all in one night to save his younger brother's life as repayment for his brother's colossal screw up in a car boost. PQ is excellent. Solid blacks, colors and nice detail. SQ is very dynamic and a real treat to experience. Wish I had picked this BD up earlier! A real Gem with very good rewatchability. Highly Recommended!
B000UR9T82|5.0|This is an amazing blu-ray box set of the 3 Spiderman movies. In beautiful 1080p high definition picture,  spiderman have never looked better ! IF you own a Playstation 3 or any another blu-ray player and looking for your first blu-ray to buy , GET THIS ONE ! Its one of the best looking and sounding titles out and the movies are great. Lots of detail and color pop in the picture    Pick this one up, you will NOT be disappointed.    Highly Recommended
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|Favorite Line in this film... \\"Who the F&%K! Are You?!\\" A nice greeting for someone who just saved their bacon! Alice does live here and she owns this property! Our favorite genetically enhanced female weapon (courtesy of the Umbrella corporation) has been selected to face off against another type of genetically altered human weapon to see which type would serve best for the Umbrella weapons division and military application. But the fun doesn't stop there. They also threw in a hundred thousand Zombies running around the now infected Raccoon City! What more could one ask for? Oh, and our small rag tag group of humans have to somehow escape the now locked down city before dawn before the place gets sanitized by a nuke. Enough pressure for one movie? Oh Ya! I'd buy that for a dollar!<br />PQ is excellent! Solid blacks, colors, great detail and all shot at night. SQ is very dynamic and my downstairs neighbors hate me. Cool new genre right here. Action / Horror / Zombie Fest / Nuke films. Can't wait for the third one!
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Strong , pretty melodies. Even after classic after classic , Neil still can write a beautiful melody. Lyrically intelligent and musically brilliant.Another keeper from Mr. Eclectic.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|Having been into AV and home movie watching since VHS arrived, I have to tell you that Blu technology for PQ and SQ is what all of us long time enthusiasts have been waiting for. Halloween on BD is once again lending me to say that this is the first time I have really seen this movie. Even though I saw it in the theater in 1978, owned on VHS and DVD. The innocent and very eerie musical score by John Carpenter matches his more subtle directorial and far more powerfully effective psychological techniques of using dark scenes, shadows, subjective angles and facial reaction close-ups to deliver a timeless classic and new Horror Genre. Halloween started it's own genre which was copied but never equaled by such slasher flicks as the Friday the Thirteenth 1 thru 87 movies. Freddy and Jason were good in their time and are still entertaining, but these movies do not command the timeless attraction and longevity that Halloween always has had and will in the future. PQ is absolutely Stunning. Colors are natural, beautiful, Blacks are as solid and grain free (as is the entire movie) as you will ever see. This is one 10+ superb and suprising transfer. PQ was so impressive in this new PCM re-mix of 5.1. I could go on and on about the sound, but would rather have you experience it for yourself. PQ is also a 10+. Especially for a movie made on a 300K budget with probably only stereo mix (2 channels) in 1978. Bottom line is this: If you like this movie even half way, the blu experience ups it 10 fold. If you have never seen it and like well made suspense films, this is a must! Happy Halloween!
B000000W5N|5.0|Argument after argument. Is it \\"Sticky Fingers\\" ? Is it \\"Exile on Main Street\\" ? Is it \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" ? Is it \\"Let It Bleed\\" ? Which IS the best Stones album ? Note for note , this gets my vote. But really , no one released a string of classics albums like this. UNBELIEVABLE (but true)
B000O5B4C4|5.0|Basic Instinct: The Director's Cut adds a couple quick \\"cuts\\" of violence in the movie's opening and includes a healthy pack of extended sexual scenes. This Movie really is the quint essential \\"Who Dunn it\\" film with more twists and turns playing on the audience than any film to date. The acting is superb all around. Sharon Stone does a masterful job in adding her charater's enveloping and persistent tension with each personal encounter. PQ is above average with solid colors. SQ is above average when things heat up, but as far as sound goes, this is not the kind of movie that demands an intense sound track. What does shine here is the musical score. The main montage is a beautiful and yet haunting piece which is subtle yet very powerful! Almost on a subconscious level. Basic Instinct is a true thriller of entertainment augmented by excellent directing, acting, music and plot. I have yet to see anything this well made in it's genre. A must own on BD!
B000068FXX|5.0|What a great album. Have never listened to this without listening all the way through. The first four songs alone taunt and tease you into playing the whole disc.
B00000F214|4.0|The Usual Suspects is pure movie entertainment. A brilliant story with superb acting all around makes this a true pleasure to watch again and again. PQ and SQ is what you would expect from the HD BD up-grade from DVD and does increase the viewing/audible experience. But this movie is more about an intelligent script, tight directing and characters that are as real as you will ever experience in celluloid. Impressive, and very dark characters from the underworld of crime come alive on BD! Recommended!
B000QUUD60|3.0|I saw Elvis: That's The Way It Is in the movie theater/cinema upon it's original release back in '70.  It was in mono.  Not stereo.  Hence the original still in mono here.    My gripe with this package isn't the mono original.  But rather that I musy pay for two DVDs when I only want one (the original).  Personally, I can't stand the re-edited version.  Elvis for the \\"MTV Generation\\" I call it.  Yuck!!
B000KQF6X0|5.0|Black Rain on blu-ray delivers! Michael Douglas is one driven street cop who boarders on the edge of acceptable society. Just as his character in Basic Instinct, his name is \\"Nick\\" and he is once again under investigation from Internal Affairs. (suits man!) But that's all background. Nick goes up against the Japanese Mob to track down the ruthless Killer \\"Sato\\" who is an up and coming renegade mob boss who wants his own territory. Things start off in New York City and the chase ensues to Japan. PQ is above average as well is SQ. This is a very entertaining film with our hero doing what ever it takes to get the job done. Highly entertaining and Highly Recommended!
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|First off, I am an avid lover of the BBC P&P with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. That being said, when I first watched this movie, I could not help but compare Matthew and Keira to the two actors I loved.  I had decidedly hated it before it was even completed!<br /><br />I watched it again and enjoyed it a bit more.  The actors who portray Jane and Bingley do a great job.  I loved Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet and Dame Judi as Lady Catherine...<br /><br />After a third viewing (thanks to my DVR), I have bought it.  I like that I can get the story in 2 hours instead of 6, if I am in a \\"hurry\\" for some Austen.  :)  Matthew's Darcy talks a bit to fast for me at some times and Keira's Elizabeth can be a bit wooden, but there are times where their sparks do outshine Colin and Jennifer's.  If watched with an open mind, maybe it will grow on you as well.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|Superman: The Movie is still the best of all of them. Old or new. The incorporation of nostalgia is thick as many tag lines from yesteryear are used. I saw this movie in the theater in 1978 and the opening credits and accompanying sound just blew me away. Since then, I have always been disappointed in the compressed sound that DVD maintains. When I bought this on BD... Holy Moley! Yep, you guessed it. It was back! BD just made it's point with shaking walls that it can re-produce sound like non other. Very dynamic! PQ is above average with some grain in the opening scenes on the planet Krypton, but that ends once back on Earth. Colors are magnificent and Superman's suit is a sight to behold. Check out those cool red boots! There are a few added scenes that I have never seen before and they really helped to augment the story a bit. Super Genius Lex Luthor adds a touch of Dr. Evil as he surrounds himself with Fricken Idiots and a lot of comedy in these scenarios. This movie has it all. Its funny, serious, nostalgic and above all, a wonderful adventure!
0743277708|5.0|Though familiar with the story having seen the old 1978 cartoon version- which sticks very close to the book, by the way- this was the first time I've read Watership Down.<br /><br />In the beginning of the tale we meet Hazel and Fiver. Fiver has a terrible feeling concerning the welfare of the warren where they make their home. Litter mates, Hazel trusts Fiver's instincts, so he takes Fiver's warning to the Chief Rabbit. Of course the old fellow thinks little Fiver's is just a silly trouble maker and will have none of it, but because Fiver has never been wrong before AND his feeling of imminent danger is so strong, Hazel decides it's time to leave. (We find later Fiver was absolutely correct!)<br /><br />It's a not a very big group who leave searching for a new home, but through the trials they face almost immediately upon leaving, they become a tight knit group.<br /><br />What I love most about Watership Down is the Tolkienesque culture Adams brings to the world of rabbits complete with language, a history and it's tales & myths. I LOVE little Fiver and his prophetic gift as well as Hazel who steps up to the plate as Chief Rabbit in a thoughtful and even kind manner. (He befriends creatures that rabbits normally would avoid with an insight into the rabbits future survival that is almost as prophetic as Fiver!)<br /><br />The story itself is thrilling as we watch the group face danger all around,(and survive!), until they eventually settle on Watership Down. Even then, there a couple more trials they must face as they set out to find females to aid in their new warren life. The creepy rabbits of the Tharn Warren (also known as Cowslip's Warren) and Efrafa make me shiver as much as any character in a Stephen King novel!<br /><br />I believe this story has a lot to teach us about morality in leadership and also about being leaders- as well as followers. It's also serves as a reminder about our influence as humans upon the creatures of the earth. After all, we are all inter-connected, aren't we?l inter-connected, aren't we?
1402568851|4.0|The mystery portion of this book is really a relatively small part of the book, but the death of Wellington, a neighbor's dog is the action that starts a starts a chain reaction that causes 15 year old Christopher Boone to go on the adventure of his life and wrap up any number of loose ends. I'd dare to say that we have some similarities with Huckleberry Finn in this book.<br /><br />Throw in the fact that Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome and you've got a remarkable book. Is it equal to all of the hype? Probably not, but how could any book be THAT good?<br /><br />I \\"read\\" this book as an audiobook and it was extremely well narrated by Jeff Woodman.

075640407X|4.0|\\"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day One)\\" launches a new fantasy trilogy where Kote, a simple bartender, recounts the tales of Kvothe to the Chronicler, a man who records stories.  The novel covers one day's worth of emotional accounts about a young boy's struggle in his quest to learn about the demonic Chandrian.  The character and environmental descriptions nicely convey the richness of the world and the occasional action sequences are creative and well thought out.<br /><br />Kvothe maintains an optimistic attitude when he interacts with friends, potential romances, and bullies as he battles poverty.  I respect the positive outlook because I have recently read too many grim scenes.  I believe with all of his natural abilities, the money issues should not have been as severe of a problem.  Although there appears to be ominous tidings near the local town, the storyline focuses on the protagonist's younger years, so do not expect overwhelming magic, graphic themes, or huge antagonist threatening world destruction.<br /><br />The schooling and training of Kvothe will provide an excellent groundwork to (hopefully) a powerful series with polished magic.  I expect a lot of good material for the final two books for the trilogy to be successful.<br /><br />Various terms are defined after several pages which weren't obvious in meaning beforehand.  Also the many unexplained races and cultures may be confusing and numerous locations are not noted on the map.  A more detailed map of the significant terrains and comprehensive appendix would have been useful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
B000V4UFZK|2.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and I've reviewed the earlier DVD issue elsewhere.  My review this time is purely for the new DVD reissue which is one of the biggest disappointments I've come across.  Let's start with this \\"25th Anniversary.\\"  The only mention of the anniversary is a haphazardly placed sticker on the outer sleeve. The fact that it was just slapped onto the box gives the buyer an idea of how much thought went into this new DVD.<br /><br />Then there are the extras.  A documentary about true-life hauntings.  Okay, that's not bad.  But wait - where's the original trailer for the film that was on the earlier DVD?  It's been removed. Did the trailer get sucked into Carol Anne's closet and is being held captive by the Beast?  What purpose did removing the trailer serve?<br /><br />This is a pointless release.  My advice is to hang onto the earlier release which is anamorphic AND has the trailer and skip this one; there will be another, hopefully better, release someday.  Warner Brothers should be ashamed.

B000WSHF4E|4.0|When we last left Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett), she was young and inexperienced, struggling to come to terms with ruling a country. We now rejoin her in \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age,\\" which begins well into her reign; beginning in the year 1585, the film chronicles the growing tension between England and Spain and culminates with a fierce sea battle. It also examines the relationship between Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), an adventurous seafarer. What we're presented with is less of an actual account and more of a dramatic love story, which basically means that it isn't even close to being historically accurate. But I guess that isn't a bad thing, considering the film's more creative aspects--\\"The Golden Age\\" is a triumph of set and costume design, and the performances are top notch.    If only the story were at the same level. It would be too much to say that the plot isn't interesting; rather, it isn't interesting enough. Much of the material plays like a run of the mill romance, regardless of the time period. I just know that so much more defined Queen Elizabeth I, and I wish the filmmakers had given her character a little more depth. Not that she's completely shallow--if anything, quite a lot weighs heavy on her mind, not the least of which is her conniving cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton). Most of their rivalry stems from different religious faiths: Elizabeth is Protestant while Mary is Catholic. Hoping to take control of the throne, Mary conspires to have Elizabeth assassinated. Intercepting on Elizabeth's behalf is Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), the Queen's most trusted advisor.    On Mary's side is Philip II (Jordi Mollà), King of Spain, who believes that Elizabeth has turned England into a godless country. He intends to conquer the Queen by sending a mighty armada, and the Spanish Inquisition along with it. Elizabeth understands that England's resources are depleted, as is its money; a counterattack will be muchharder to plan and execute. Despite being incredibly strong-willed, something is holding her back, something that's diminishing her confidence. She seems to rely on Raleigh to soothe her, despite not knowing who he is or where he came from. All we do know is that he's arrived home from the New World, where he named a colony in honor of the Virgin Queen (Virginia). We've seen many films that make the Mysterious Stranger engaging or downright sexy--indeed, Raleigh is dashing, flirtatious, and bold. Just watch the way he presents potatoes and tobacco to Elizabeth.    Hoping to win favor with the Queen, Raleigh gets close to her favorite Lady in Waiting, Bess (Abbie Cornish), and it becomes obvious that his affections are divided between these two women. This plot device could have been much more interesting had it not been so cliché; I've seen romantic conflict before, and it's usually reserved for escapist films. But \\"The Golden Age\\" is historical in context. I wanted more focus on the impending Spanish attack, especially since it was so intertwined with Elizabeth's assassination plot. The final major sequence does feature some battle, but not enough to be satisfying. It's as if the film fizzles out after spending so much time building itself up. It's not entirely a letdown, but it is a disappointment. This is especially true of Elizabeth's pre-battle speech: clad in armor, she rides a horse in front of her army while spewing encouraging sayings. I half expected her to say that the enemy may take their lives, but they'd never take their freedom.    Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. I greatly enjoyed Blanchett's performance; she gave Elizabeth a determined yet fragile quality that was compelling. I distinctly remember an emotional outburst aimed at the Spanish ambassador: \\"I too can command the wind, sir!\\" she screams. \\"I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare if you dare to try me!\\" This moment was raw and overwhelming, which was appropriate given her emotional state. I also remember a scene in an astrologist's lair showing Elizabeth's desperation. She clearly couldn't stand not knowing how everything would turn out. It was prophesized that two kingdoms would battle and only one would fall--the Queen would like nothing more than to hear that England will be victorious. Unfortunately, that cannot be guaranteed.    Yes, there is a lot to recommend about \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age,\\" and thank goodness that the good outweighs the bad. This is not a perfect film, but it can still get an audience from point A to point B. And it certainly is wonderful to look at; every shot is so richly detailed that you can't help but admire the work that went into it. The costumes are vivid, colorful, and intricate. The sets are lavish and bold, with practically every location dripping with colorful tapestries. The armada attack features a number of convincing special effects. Basically, everything felt real in terms of the film's look. The film's story, on the other hand, wasn't all that it could have been. There's a wealth of material on Queen Elizabeth I, and I can't help but feel that most of it was disregarded to make room for romantic elements. Romance works, but only to a point.

B000URDEB0|5.0|This CD shall remain in my CD player for a long time to come. I totally prefer this CD than Once. I hated that album, it was mostly all filler. See my review that no one liked to get the meaning of what I said of it here. I own the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" cause when it comes to Nightwish I spare no expense and I just have to have the best that there is about them. I own everything that they have put out on CD from Full lengths, singles, box sets. I spend so much money on Nightwish I should buy stock in them. Anyways. This is nothing like \\"Once\\" and I am so thankful for that. This album has all the balls that Nightwish needed to shine on with Anette. I'm gonna miss Tarja, but she has her own stuff coming out and I own that too. But this is about Nightwish and not her. This is a MUST HAVE, there is no questioning. A different direction is taken with this album and I like it. Aggressive and heavy is all the way wether it's song, music or vocals. Just one thing please, don't start sounding like all the other female fronted bands. I don't like what ROADRUNNER RECORDS is doing right now with their artists. This is moving in the right direction for me. Don't get lost in the ocean.

0440237688|5.0|As an avid realistic fiction reader I wholeheartedly recommend this book. This is perhaps the only science fiction/ dystopia book I have read and thouroughly enjoyed. Lowry's writing is wonderful and the story is well thought out. I loved it the first time I was introduced to it in fourth grade or so and love it some five years later. It is a quick read and time well spent.
B000URDEB0|5.0|To me, the whole \\"Tarja vs Anette\\" debate is pointless. The power of Nightwish has always been the band's incredible songs. Tuomas made it clear that, for the band to continue, a new vocalist was needed. Which I totally agreed with. Tarja may have been a great singer (no argument about that), but her attitude was become insufferable. Take her not wishing to play clubs and small venues in the U.S. on the Once tour, which effectively killed their best CD to date in this country.   Dark Passion Play is another step in the progression of Nightwish. It retains their symphonic rock approach while adding both power and subtle edges. Anette's voice is not as operatic as Tarja, but (IMHO) a lot stronger. This should make Nightwish better as a live band.   Dark Passion Play shows Nightwish is still at the top of their game. Let the American pretenders such a Evanescence beware. The true kings of progressive gothic rock have come to show how it is really done.
1401300529|3.0|Having served two tours in the infantry in Korea during the War, and being a Korean War buff, I have a different view of the book than most of the reviewers. Unfortunately, the reviewers think that this book is about the Korean War. In part that is true but the real theme of the book is about how General Douglas MacArthur screwed it up.     The book is not a complete history of the Korean War as some reviewers have touted. It is anything but that. The book centers on the time period during which Gen. MacArthur was in command, both pre-war and until Pres. Truman relieved him of command. What little remains is more of an epilog very briefly describing the aftermath. That is why the book title is \\"The Coldest Winter\\" because it focuses on the disastrous defeat of the UN troops during the winter of 1950 as the result of MacArthur's bungling.     Because the book was billed as the most comprehensive history of the Korean War, I was lulled into reading it, only to be sorely disappointed. The first eight months of the War have been extensively covered in books and documentaries with the remaining 2 1/2 years given only cursory exposure, even though several major battles were fought during that period, so Halberstam doesn't expose any new ground. He just regurgitates material already written although he does it in an interesting fashion.     What I had hoped to read about was a thorough rendition of the history following MacArthur and the political decisions that colored the War and that was not there in the book for me. Not that I am not aware of them but a lot happened that is not generally known about and I hoped that Halberstam, with his reputation, would expose that material so that it become common knowledge to those studying or even interested in the War.      Some tout the book as telling the story of the historic escape of the First Marine Division from the Chosen Reservoir. It doesn't at all. The book tells how the Division Commander ignored MacArthur's orders innot racing to the Yalu and consequently the Marines were able make an orderly retreat, which the Army units were unable to do, but Halberstam provides almost no facts concerning the actual retreat, but when he does, the facts are not always correct. For example, the Chinese blew up the bridge between Koto-ri and Hungnam which crossed a narrow mountain gorge. Marine engineers then replaced it with a Bailey Bridge that was parachuted in. Halberstam says that it was the Air Force that dropped the bridge but I was on guard on the mountain above the gorge and I saw the bridge dropped from  Marine Corps Flying Boxcars.     The book is not even a complete history of the first eight months of the Korean War. Most of it is devoted to certain battles which illustrated the incompetence either of MacArthur or the officers under him. It is only a partial picture of that period of the War but what there is, is done in remarkable detail.     Halberstam doesn't not highlight some of MacArthur's bad decisions as much as they should have been. While he brings out that it would have been a better strategy if the Marines had by-passed Seoul after landing at Inchon and cut off the retreat of the North Koreans, he doesn't give that mistake the emphasis that it warrants because it was a decision that really prolonged the War. Those familiar with the War are very conscious of that but lay readers may not.      Nor does he allude to the fact that MacArthur violated a basic tenant of fighting a War and that is after winning a battle, it is a cardinal principle that you stop and consolidate before resuming the attack. His failure to adhere to that principle was one reason the UN troops were so vulnerable when the Chinese struck.      One lament I have about the book is that it falls well short of providing its readers of what happened after Gen. Ridgeway took command. The book describes how the Chinese were suffering horrendous losses but Halberstam fails to follow through. The UN counter offensive resulted in more heavy losses to the Chinese as they were pushed back into North Korea, particularly on the eastern flank. The entire Chinese front was in such danger or collapsing that the Chinese sought a truce and Pres. Truman's biggest mistake was to agree to the truce. Had the UN rejected the truce offer, the Chinese would have been forced to retreat deep into N. Korea and that would have been a propitious time for the UN to agree to an armistice. Instead, the war went on for over two more years ending on July 28, 1953. It ended then only because a major Chinese offensive designed to push the Marines back across the Imjin River failed and the Chinese again had run out of steam.      Despite its shortcomings , as a book about the blundering of Gen. MacArthur, it is superb. Unfortunately, it was written 50 years too late. MacArthur was a desk general from the start of WWII and remained so during the Korean War. He really botched up the defense of the Philippines but because the Americans needed a hero, he was made a hero instead of a goat. He should have been relieved of his command. He actually played a subordinate role in the Pacific War which was mainly run by the Navy, but we all can be thankful for the atomic bomb, because if the Japanese had not surrendered, MacArthur would have been in charge of the invasion of Japan.

Most of the time I had to fast forward though the other side of the tape that had a different album on it. This is the original Maggie May. The accoustic performance of Amazing Grace (that is not even listed on the album song list is spiritually uplifting and hauntingly beautiful. My kids liked the album the first time they heard it asking me what it was. This is on my list of my favorite 25 albums of all time. There is something about this album, I can listen to it on a regular basis and it just makes me feel good.
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|Since I've never bought a director's cut before and I already have the theatrical film version, I hesitated on this, hoping the additional footage wouldn't be just a matter of bloodier battles and bared bosoms, but in fact most of the additional material fleshes out existing scenes, giving many of the characters more depth.  Much of the additional dialogue goes to Peter O'Toole's King Priam, giving the reasons behind his decisions.  This is one of my favorite films, and I prefer the director's cut.    But those who thought the battle scenes in the original release quite vivid enough may want to skip this.  The sack of Troy is especially horrifying in this cut, with women and infants now put to the sword.    Like Mr. Robbins in an earlier review, I thought the scoring inferior.  Most of the musical cues have been rearranged and a few added and deleted; the sum total is much less effective than the original soundtrack.    The movie is attractively packaged with production stills, sample script pages, and artists' set renderings.  This remains one of my favorite sword and sandals films for its spectacle and drama, so the director's cut was money well spent for me, but the original release is quite good on its own merits for those who don't want to shell out the extra money.

After listening to the fine production work he did on Amadou and Mariam's excellent \\"Dimanche A Bamako\\" a few years back (check it out if you're not familiar - it rocks!), I can here strains of that album here as well. \\"Politics is Violence\\" for example, is a reworking of a cut from that earlier album.  While the Afro influences are much more subdued here, \\"Radiolina\\" is a sum of many World elements.  Just wish some of the good cuts were a bit longer for extra enjoyment!

I had lost a little faith after \\"Bare\\", which I found to be almost too dirge-like in it's style, but I have to say, SOMD rocked my world from beginning to end.

B000007O9L|5.0|I own three live releases by the Rolling Stones.  \\"Got Live (if you want it)\\", \\"Get Your Ya Ya's Out!\\" and \\"Stripped\\".  As a musician who has been playing for over 40 years in various bands from reggae to rock to jazz I can tell you that Stripped is a far better set of performances than those on Get Your Ya Ya's Out and, to state the obvious, \\"Got Live...\\".  For some reason, many people think Ya Ya's is the greatest live record of all time.  That's highly debatable - see my \\"Get Your Ya Ya's Out\\" review that gives the reader an objective dose of reality (and people, I AM right about Get Your Ya Ya's Out).  I'm pleased to tell you that Stripped has far better musicianship and the sound, while preserving that \\"loose\\" Stones feel, is much tighter that the performances on Get Your Ya Ya's Out.  These guys used THIS release to strut their musicianship and it is excellent.  Better than I'd thought, that's for sure.<br /><br />Most of the tracks on Stripped were recorded in front of a live audience but some are taken from rehearsals.  This is basically an \\"unplugged\\" release (though there is plenty of electricity).  In general, this release has an acoustic flavor to it though it's by no means a couple of guys strummin' guitars with Jagger singing.<br /><br />Some of the tracks on Stripped are actually better performances than the originals, Shine a Light for example.  The version of Street Fighting Man is by far the best live rendition I've heard though no live version will ever remotely even approximate the original from Beggar's Banquet.<br /><br />In summary, there are no \\"stinker\\" tracks on Stripped, they are all very good and some I dare say are truly great (and I don't tend to like the Rolling Stones' live releases)!  There's even some friendly word play among the performers between tunes and a humorous false start of \\"Love in Vain\\".  Stripped is far more entertaining and enjoyable than Ya Ya's in my opinion - regardless of what all those Ya Ya's die hard fans might tell you.  Ya Ya's is good but this is much better.good but this is much better.
B000NA77YO|5.0|What can be said about Black Sabbath? A band way before it's time from the grit and grime of Birmingham England came the sound that would officially branch off into the fast, powerful and sometimes scary genere of Heavy Metal. For far too long while Black Sabbath has been known for its legendary vocalist Ozzy Osbourne and the dark guitars of Tony Iommi there hasn't been much out there that told all the fans of Sabbath that there was a whole other chapter of this bands story.<br /><br />I myself always knew there was Sabbath after Ozzy, but I had no idea that the lead singer was the great Ronny James Dio! Now finally The Dio Years have been released and I have to say I am amazed. Dio really brings a whole new level to this band. While the sound really leans towards the sounds of epic and power metal the true Sabbath sound is still there. I beleive with no disrespect to the Prince of Darkness that Dio gives more definition to this band. You can hear it in the songs like Heaven and Hell, Die Young and many others. This CD is a very important one to listen to because Dio is very unappreciated and this chapter in Sabbaths now legendary career really needs to be brought out into the open so the fans know that even without Ozzy Sabbath was still able to play hard and bring their sound to the masses as they should.
0143036556|5.0|This extraordinary book will change the way you look at life and man's fate.  Unlike Al Gore, Diamond deliberately under-argues his case, which makes it all the more compelling.  And unlike Gore, he does not open himself to easy and cheap criticism by focusing on just one factor like climactic warming.  He clearly believes in global warming from man-made effects.  But what he demonstrates is the full range of our environmental quandary.      Putting aside global warming, how do we deal with the inherent limits on absolutely vital commodities -- sunlight, fossil fuels, fresh water,building materials, clean air, clean water, good land, the productive value of agricultural land?  Then he shows the pressure of and irreversible momentum of population growth and the ambition of third world peoples to achieve the standard of living of first world peoples.  Then he shows how even the first world cannot continue to sustain that standard.     Combined with this are the examples of past civlizations that failed by not solving their environmental problems.  Most chilling is how those societies could remain in denial and do nothing until too late.      Diamond does include examples of successful societies that managed their environmental challenges.  And he professes to be an optimist.  But I find myself increasingly pessimistic about man's fate after reading this book.  The Earth is a jealous mistress, and we cannot afford to take her for granted and to ignore the fragility of the environment and resources on which we depend.     The book is also extraordinary for its exploration of political and cultural issues.  One of the most interesting chapters is his comparison of the Dominican Republic and Haiti -- two very different societies on two halves of the same island.  He argues quite convincingly that the very different fates of the two societies are attributable to political, historical, and cultural developments.  Though there are some differences between each half of the island, each is blessed with the same essential environment.  Hence this is a great test case for proving or disproving environmental determinism -- and Diamond comes out against determinism.     Similarly compelling is the Rwanda chapter, which demonstrates that while the small differences and petty resentments between races can be the spark for genocidal conflict, race really doesn't explain the conflict.  What explains the conflict is political manipulation of race and the great pressure asserted by declining wealth and resource limitations.      Diamond predicts that wars may well become more common in the new century given the competition for resources.  This is a depressing observation for those who hoped that the lessons of the Twentieth Century would make wars far less common.      This is a terrific book and a must-read.

This so-called tale, or maybe tale is a better description than story, is so far out of touch with history that it is pathetic.  Yes, sometimes the CIA can be pretty pathetic, too, but at least their pathos is not contrived, it just happens, humans being human, after all.  DeNiro's pathetic film is totally contrived and seems to be directed at making the USA's spy mission somehow evil.  What were we (the US) to do during the Second World War and the following Cold War?  Close our eyes and pretend that the Soviets and Papa Joe Stalin were a bunch of nice guys not trying to get us.  They certainly were trying to get us and if sometimes our spy agencies screwed up, well, as I said above, they were human; and if anyone thinks the Soviets didn't screw up, they need to read up on their history.  All in all a pathetic picture, made more pathetic by poor editing and historically inaccurate tale-telling.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|Way back when I was a kid in the 1960s, mixing music with politics was commonplace, and artists were an integral part of the protest movement.  Their music reflected the feelings of that segment of the population and gave voice to those concerns.  Now, 40 years later, I have a real sense of deja vu.  We are in a war that is becoming increasingly unpopular and people are beginning to rise up to say \\"enough already.\\"  Just last month, 3,000 people marched in Syracuse, NY, the largest such gathering since the Vietnam era.<br /><br />So how is all of this pertitent to my review? 'Magic' is inspired. A light, pop, fluffy collection of catchy tunes that grabs the listener the first time through, the album has a darker side, conveying what Springsteen perceives to be the situation in our country today.  Nothing is what it seems, and a tune that portends to be about one thing, is really about something entirely different.<br /><br />I listened to the CD the first time through in the car. I replayed tracks like \\"Radio Nowhere\\" and \\"Magic\\" over and over, unable to resist.  The album is his best in years (and yes, I liked 'The Rising').  I have no problem with the sound mix or his vocals, and am left wanting more.<br /><br />Thanks Bruce for bringing us all a dose of reality.

B000OVLBEO|4.0|Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) was once a teenager who had a stuntman for a father and he was sick with cancer, so he made a deal with the Devil (Peter Fonda) to save his father's life and to fulfil his dream of being a stuntman. He's now grown up as he has become the world's most popular daredevil as he's got fame and fortune, until one night he becomes a flaming skull-faced demon avenger with supernatural powers named \\"The Ghost Rider\\" equipped with a spirited motorcycle. He is reunited with his former love (Eva Mendes), meets a former Ghost-Rider (Sam Elliot) and now the evil Blackheart (Wes Bently) wants to bring hell literally on earth, for only Ghost-Rider must stop him and retain his own soul back.<br /><br />An exciting supernatural horror action fantasy thriller from the director of \\"Daredevil\\" Mark Steven Johnson is based on a popular Marvel Coimc character. Stan Lee does a cameo as usual in the Marvel movies and this is no exception since he also produced it, the performances aren't too bad but the visuals are quite good even with the creature effects. Nicolas Cage isn't a bad choice for Johnny Blaze and Eva Mendes is certainly a cutie in this movie, i believe the unrated extended cut of this movie certainly makes a slight improvement over the theatrical release with never-before-seen footage.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Extended Cut has two commentaries, three documentaries, Sin and Salvation featurettes on the history of the Ghost Rider comic character, previews and Animatics.
075640407X|5.0|What else is there to say? I absolutely LOVED IT!!!!!!!! My recommended story for the year, and all previous years of my life. I've built myself a library of fantasy novels ranging from Kelley Armstrong to Gregory Maguire to Patricia Briggs and this is my favorite book by far. This is one story, the other being \\"Where The Red Fern Grows\\", that I will read over and over again and never grow tired of.
B000VKW7AK|5.0|This box set is worth it just for the live DVD.  It's a show with the line-up from Megadeth's golden age.  They were a well-oiled machine live and the audio and video quality of the DVD is high.  In addition, there's another show with this classic line-up playing a greater variety of songs on one of the CDs.  The other CDs contain lots of cool odds and ends:  b-sides, unreleased tracks, demos, session takes, more live tracks, and a sampling of Megadeth's best studio tracks all remastered and remixed.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have been a fan of Tool since I first heard them. I am continually impressed by the bands ability to create creative, artistic albums in a musical world full of singles. This album is no exception. I have purchased, listened, and thoroughly enjoyed all of their albums over the years. I was stoked when I heard that this album was coming out, however after purchasing it and listening to it I was not impressed. I was disappointed at first, but after a few more listens and some digging I have found that this album is amazing and very thought provoking. If you are a fan of Tool this is just another shining example of a well put together album encompassing Maynards mysterious vocals, intoxicating guitar chords, and mesmerizing bass and drums that make Tool what they are. Great album and awesome band.
0807262013|1.0|I bought the trilogy after seeing that the movie was slated for release this fall.  I was blown away by the Golden Compass.  Pullman is a superb storyteller and the high adventure and incredible imagination that went into the first book was mind blowing.  I remember thinking that surely this was a story that would surpass \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" as a cultural cornerstone of fiction.  Having read \\"Paradise Lost\\" also played to my aspirations of intellectualism while reading the books.<br /><br />But when \\"The Subtle Knife\\" adds a new hero and makes an almost predictible jump to our world - present day, so begins a slide away from wonder.  Still through incredible writing ability Pullman makes an enjoyable read of it, though nowhere near the story \\"The Golden Compass\\" is.  The heavy themes certainly start leaving a childrens book mentality far behind.  It becomes unclear if the writer hates (and hate is not to strong a word here) religion or just Christianity.  Certianly Christianity has all his ire.<br /><br />By the time we get to \\"The Amber Spyglass\\"  the exciting beautiful story is a full blown anti-sermon on atheism with all the rhetoric of the most zealous puritanical ministers.  \\"He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster\\" Says Nietzsche, and that may be what transpires.  There are confusing story segments aligned it seems with the sole purpose of pontification.  Story arcs that border on boring,such as the spyglass itself, seem wholly irrelevant.  Morally bizarre situations rule the day:  Broaching sexuality for minors, excusing evil characters actions in Machina Ex Deus fashion, rebellion and out right lieing as a virtue.  Some of this could have been interesting if it were a topsy turvey things are not what they seem story, But that ship sails early on.  Instead there is no forgiving the lack of motivation for characters early actions. The climaxs are all underdeveloped as far as reasoning. The coming of age subplot has nothing to do with character.  Petulance is only rewarded.<br /><br />As you can guess by now I'm sorry I read anything past \\"The Golden Compass\\"  and worse I paid for them.  When I pickup a book I'd rather not be preached at religious or otherwise unless I am in the religion section.  This is not escapist fiction, It's a personal diatribe.  Insidiously wrapped in a childrens story.acter.  Petulance is only rewarded.      As you can guess by now I'm sorry I read anything past \\"The Golden Compass\\"   and worse I paid for them.

B000URDEB0|3.0|I have been a fan of Nightwish since the release of their 2nd album, \\"Oceanborn.\\"  To me, Nightwish was something truly special. Maybe excepting their first album (\\"Angels fall first\\"), every single Nightwish album so far has been a masterpiece in its own right. With \\"Once\\", we saw the culmination and peak of Nightwish's songwriting prowess. So, I was eagerly anticipating their next move, and wondering how they would surpass their previous efforts, or at least build on them. Alas, \\"Dark Passion Play\\" does not really deliver. And, it's not all Annette's fault. She can definitely sing, even though, admittedly, she's no Tarja. But, the songs themselves here do not really stand up to their previous brilliance. A song such as \\"The Islander\\" is the most obvious blunder here. It does not sound original, and the entirely acoustic, folk-ish vibe of it seems utterly out of place. In other spots, it seems like they're trying too hard, and it sounds forced. There are some great songs here, but overall, this album does not really measure up to the quality of most of their previous releases.<br />I guess every artist has their ups and downs. Let's hope they come back with a more focused and more inspired work next time around.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Friends is 1 of 2 shows I am able to watch over & over (the other being Sex and the City).  I enjoy season 1 just as much as I did in 1994 while it was on the air.  Had a bad day? Just turn on Friends.  I personally like the way the discs are boxed.  If I go on vacation, I can take one book instead of having to take the whole series. If you are a true fan, there is no need to look up what show is in what season (they aren't labeled on the discs, just in the booklet). Seasons 1-5 are the best--but let's face it--there was plenty of material still to work with. Love the commentaries. The creators make the viewer feel included.  I don't feel lectured to.  A lot of commentaries sound like Ben Stein from Ferris Bueller.   I did find some technical difficulties with discs skipping.  This included the disc with the London shows.  Right in the middle of when Ross says Rachel.  YGH!!!!!!!
009926689X|1.0|This book is very popular with my husbands family so I got it at my baby shower - I didn't like it a bit. Infact I got rid of it. I think any mom that is driving across down to climb up a ladder and into a window to rock her son to sleep is just strange!! I was fine with the book until I saw the picture of her in the car with the ladder on top. I just find that creepy. I won't be reading this to my son and I dread the day I have to tell my inlaws not to read it to him either. Its just creepy!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Jensen Ackles has improved from the first season, and Jared Padalecki has become a whiner in season 2.  I was never a big fan of Jensen A because I thought Jared P was so HOT! but now I'm reviewing my previous statement, since I now think Jensen A is HOT but more due to the acting, which has improved and the stories in which he features so well e.g. Hollywood Babylon.  Jensen A is now my favourite because he seems so very human.    Still the show is great and I own both seasons and can't wait for the next one.

159102594X|5.0|Action? Check. Violence? Check. Magic? Check. Politics? Check. Romance? Well you get the idea. The Blade Itself has everything I look for these days in a fantasy novel. Joe Abercrombie's debut , the first of a planned trilogy -2nd book is already out in the UK, packs a lot of action in a refreshingly (for fantasy readers) short space. Fight scenes occur often and are brilliantly written. I tend to skip over fight scenes in many fantasy novels as the writing is often boring. Not so here. The action sequences are both cinematic in scope and exciting to read.     The heart of this story, however, is its characters. It's rare to find such a fast-paced novel that is so character driven. Unlike much fantasy writing, the characters act both intelligently and consistently, so we are able to witness believable growth over the course of the novel. Each character has very human, very real flaws that impact events in the story. Many (Logen Ninefingers, Bayaz, and Glokta all spring to mind) are stock fantasy characters turned on their head and given depth.     The writing itself it superb. The dialog is witty and revealing of character. There is just enough description. And there is an energy and fun feeling of adventure that I can best compare to classic swashbuckling tales.     My one complaint, and the reason this review is 4 stars instead of 5, is the plot. Though the story moves quickly from scene to scene and lots of \\"stuff\\" happens, I feel like I worked towards an ending that was a big set-up for the rest of the series. That being said, I had a lot of fun getting to that ending and eagerly await the future entires. In fact, I'm so excited a may just try to get a UK version of Book 2: Before They Are Hanged. Highly recommended for fans of smart fantasy.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|I confess, I have a special place for Annie Lennox in my music collection. I admit my bias. After all, I was drawn to her from the first note of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" in the summer of 1983 at the tender age of 10. From then on, no matter what my peers said, I stuck with the Eurythmics through thick and thin. I saw them in concert at age 11 in the summer of 1984 for the \\"Touch\\" tour, with Howard Jones opening for them. I saw them again, at age 13, in the summer of 1986 for the \\"Revenge\\" tour. I stuck with them as \\"Savage\\" failed in America, and \\"We Two Are One\\" barely made a dent. I was disappointed when Dave and Annie split, but happy when Annie released \\"Diva\\", a near perfect album. Happy again when the Eurythmics reunited in 1999 for \\"Peace\\". And so on and so forth.<br /><br />\\"Songs Of Mass Destruction\\" is by far Annie's best solo work since \\"Diva\\". It's her most consistent, diverse and confident work since \\"Diva\\". \\"Bare\\" was somewhat depressing and slow, but Annie definitely bounces back here.<br /><br />Where to start? There are five upbeat tracks and six ballads. I liked all five upbeat tracks \\"Love Is Blind\\", \\"Ghosts In My Machine\\", \\"Womankind\\", \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" and \\"Sing\\". My favorites being the defiant \\"Ghosts In My Machine\\" and \\"Love Is Blind\\". I haven't heard Annie rail against personal demons like this since \\"Savage\\". \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" harkens back to \\"Sweet Dreams\\".<br /><br />The six ballads \\"Dark Road\\", \\"Smithereens\\", \\"Through The Glass Darkly\\", \\"Lost\\", \\"Big Sky\\" and \\"Fingernail Moon\\" are pretty solid. My favorites being the moving \\"Dark Road\\" and \\"Lost\\" (which is featured prominently during the end credits of the film \\"In The Valley Of Elah\\", which is also very good I might add). If I have any complaints it would be the weaker ballads \\"Through The Glass Darkly\\", \\"Big Sky\\" and \\"Fingernail Moon\\". All three tracks were okay, but didn't quite make the cut for me.<br /><br />At 52, Annie has made a very good album. Better than 2003's \\"Bare\\" and 1995's \\"Medusa\\", but not quite \\"Sweet Dreams\\", \\"Touch\\", \\"Be Yourself Tonight\\" or \\"Savage\\". I give it four and a half stars. If you like Annie, or you like the Eurythmics, you should get \\"Songs Of Mass Destruction\\". I think some Grammys are in order here.ms\\", \\"Touch\\", \\"Be Yourself Tonight\\" or \\"Savage\\".

B00007KWHN|5.0|I believe I first heard some of these classic songs played by a very good cover band in a club in Cincinatti, Ohio back in the early 70's. I could not believe how much I really liked Yours Is No Disgrace and All Good People. This was a new sound and I was in heaven! I found out the tunes I liked were originally written by a \\"new group\\" named Yes. Once I located a copy of this album, my whole musical life changed. Thank you Yes. Highly recommended and one hundred stars! - Ciao
0486237664|4.0|Wow - the enormous numbers of animal life is astounding and the book clearly shows this.  Unfortunately the images are quite dark and the book is very thick (you get your money's worth - image-wise), so scanning them for use in various artistic media is difficult.  Therefore, I bought two of the books and plan to cut one of them up (that hurts to say for I treasure books of all types).  This way I can control the scanning and modification using software to bring out details and highlight an image to my satisfaction.  And finally, the classic images are impressive and I applaud the author for his selection of animals from all realms of life on earth.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|As a Eurythmics/Annnie fan from the early 80's, I learned a long time ago to never compare newest albums to previous works?    Why?     Because Annie is an artist who is always evolving.  Eurythimics started out with synth pop/new wave and evolved into harder Rock.  It would be hard to imagine a group or artist other than Eurythmics/Annie Lennox putting out the synth songs on \\"Touch\\" (\\"Regrets\\", etc) as being the same artists who then delivered the hard hitting rock of \\"Would I lie to you?\\" on their next major album, \\"Be yourself tonight\\".    I don't compare \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\" to \\"Diva\\", \\"Medusa\\" or \\"Bare\\".    Each one of them showcases a uniquely gifted singer at different stages in her personal life.  I've been impressed with every album.  There are songs on each that are classics to me.     \\"Cold\\" and \\"Legend in my livingroom\\" and, of course, \\"Why\\", stood out for me on \\"Diva\\".     I loved \\"Medusa\\".  Too many people dismiss it as a \\"cover\\" album. Well, Annie's \\"cover\\" album was far superior to the \\"new\\" music that most other artists were and still are making    Her rendition of \\"Train in Vain\\" still blows me away today.    Same with \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\".     And of course,\\"No more I Love You's\\".    \\"Bare\\" was astounding in it's honesty.    When she hits that high note in \\"Wonderful\\", I get chills down my spine.  And maybe some were turned off by the darkness of this album..but I was impressed by the songwriting. \\"Don't want to need you, but it's where I'm at\\". Genius, pure genius.     \\"Loneliness\\" was mesmerizing.     \\"1000 Beautiful Things\\".  I dare any other artist to do a recording THAT complex.     And now this album...Wow!     There wasn't as much \\"production\\" on this album.      Gone are Annie's overlapping harmonies..singing with herself, which I admit I love.  She does it better than anyone.  This album is alot more raw in it's production.  Her voice is as smooth, strong and beautiful as ever but more bare than it was on \\"Bare\\".  I'm sure the irony didn't elude her.      She's in a different place in her life but she's still Annie.      \\"Fingernail Moon\\" is gorgeous.     I love \\"Dark Road\\".  Can't get it out of my head.       Same with the chorus from \\"Sing\\".      \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" will be mixed and become a top dance hit. Trust me.      \\"Ghosts in my machine\\" evokes \\"Touch\\" era Eurythmics but more mature.    \\"Lost\\" is mesmerizing and then haunting and then almost surreal.  I love that she takes chances.  No one else would dare to sound almost crazed on a song..except maybe Kate Bush.     \\"Through the glass darkly\\"...a showcase for the undeniable strength of Lennox's contralto.     With all said, I love this album and don't judge it by her previous works.  I wish everyone would acknowledge and respect that Lennox is one artist who isn't grinding out the same old \\"hooks\\" that sold previous records.  She's an artist with integrity who is always willing to try something new.      The one thing you can always count on though is that magnificent voice.    And see her live, if you get the chance. Beg, borrow or steal to do it.  If her album didn't impress you. Her live performance will.  She's one of the best live performers of our lifetime!

B00005JPKE|5.0|Clint Eastwood's companion piece to \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" may be the director's finest work to date. In telling the story of the battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese, Eastwood is sympathetic to the soldiers whose attempt to defend the island is doomed, but with the exception of one scene, does so without vilifying the American troops who succeeded where the Japanese failed.<br /><br />The film succeeds by personalizing the war for the men who fought it. Whatever one thinks of their cause, these men are motivated by the same patriotic forces as the Americans, and are simply doing what they believe is just. After all, wars are planned and manipulated by men who never set foot on the battlefield. Even the most heroic soldiers, regardless of the country from which they hail, fight in service to interests that benefit the business community more than their country.<br /><br />Eastwood's one false and manipulative move is a scene in which two Japanese deserters are cold-bloodly gunned down by Americans. This is in stark contrast to an earlier moment when an American held hostage by the opposition is treated respectfully by his captors. The latter scene is an admirable attempt to humanize the enemy but is unnecessary since the film has already successfully countered the smirking and monstrous stereotypes of the Japanese that were promoted by Hollywood during and shortly after World War II. The barbarism we witness from the Americans, however, whether accurate or not, seems like sop meant to appeal to the anti-American sentiments expressed as a result of our invasion of Iraq.<br /><br />Technically, \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is faultless. Tom Stern's cinematography is appropriately murky, and the imagery striking. The performances are all superb, especially from Ken Watanabe as General Kuribayashi, Kazunari Nonomiya as Saigo, and Tsuyoshi Ihara as Baron Nishi. The screenplay by Iris Yamahita and Paul Haggis is compact, and nicely interweaves scenes of the men's earlier civilian life with their dreary existence awaiting certain death.

0553805460|1.0|\\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" is probably the worst book I've read all year. It consists of non-stop extreme drug use, promiscuous and pornographic sex, money laundering, and stock manipulation, while providing little or no explanation of how author Jordan Belfort built his firm and worked his financial machinations.<br /><br />Other sources help fill in the blanks. Belfort's business, according to Business Week, was part of a $10 billion/year business that regulators lagged in controlling. \\"Chop stocks\\" (bought at a large discount) made up perhaps half the 1997 85 million-share daily volume of the OTC Bulletin Board, plus dozens of stocks on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market. Belfort would purchase a hidden stake in a relatively new firm that would then issue \\"letter\\" stock under Rule 144 of the securities laws, commonplace at many perfectly legitimate companies as a way of rewarding key employees and giving them an equity interest. Letter stock and warrants were also issued to compensate consultants in lieu of cash. And stock issued overseas, under Regulation S of the securities laws, is a widely recognized way of raising capital for emerging companies. Reg. S stock is cheap for a simple reason: Since it cannot be legally traded for two years, it is commonly issued at a steep discount. Rule 144 stock is also cheap because it is usually issued at little or no cost and must be held for one or two years.<br /><br />Belfort would make large profits by ignoring the law and \\"laundering\\" the stocks by selling them long before the two years had expired. If customers were to see the stock (marked \\"restricted\\"), they might realize that it's not supposed to be sold to the public. So the chop houses had a simple solution: They didn't show the customers the stock. The shares were only a book entry, and the brokers were reluctant to resell it once bought by a customer. If forced to do so, they would by duping a new customer into purchasing the shares.<br /><br />Belfort served 22 months in prison and has been banned from the securities industry. His firm was closed in 1996, and he is required to repay $110 million to investors at the rate of 50% of everything he now makes.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is possibly one of the most original television series to have ever been created.  It's fresh, funny and most importantly intelligent! Joss Whedon is one of the very few creators out there, that actually respects his audience and as such delivers a product that bows to no formula.    The writing is superb and the actors interpret scripts with consumate skill. I am very attached to this series and would highly reccomend it to anyone.
B000E994KE|4.0|This is the first disc I've picked up from this band, I picked it up because an ancient friend of mine told me an equally long time ago that this band was good.  At the time I was no longer into death metal, so I didn't really pay them much mind.  I picked this gem up a few weeks ago, and at first I was not 100% sure where I placed my like or dislike.  It isn't at all what you'd expect, they have a slightly mainstream sound, and while I say that, it is subtle.  They use some usual chord progressions, but as a rule, they tend to be very original takes on those chord structures.  If I was to pick another album that this one reminds me of, it would be Poisonblack's \\"Lust Stained Despair.\\"<br /><br />The death metal twists aren't absent from this album--but they are just that.  \\"twists.\\"  There is no double-bass assaults, and many of the keyboards are a bit more 'progressive' in influence, but I'm a guy who also likes Communic and Nevermore, so that's not a bad thing in my book.  There's also some non-traditional instruments, like flute on \\"Leaves Scar,\\"  which is easily one of my favorites.  These guys are very open-minded on their music, and it is truly--amorphis--in the strictest definition of that word.<br /><br />If you're a strict death-metal head, there isn't anything for you here.

B000OVLBF8|2.0|Ultimately, \\"Ghost Rider\\" neither succeeds as a good movie or an entertaining bad movie.  The pacing is awful, and the story nonexistent.  What kind of movie wastes the gonzo talents of both Nicholas Cage and Peter Fonda?  This one.  What kind of movie wastes the comic genius of Donal Logue?  This one.  A great cast is squandered in a morass of senseless story.  \\"Ghost Rider\\" is badly written and badly directed.  If you must watch this, rent and don't buy.  And be prepared to nap in the middle.

B000002UAU|5.0|What more can be said about THE GREATEST ALBUM IN MUSIC HISTORY???...no if's, and's. or but's about it!  For those who feel this album is dated, perhaps you should throw away your watches!  I'm sure John, Paul, George & Ringo would agree with Chicago when they asked 'Does anybody really know what time it is?...Does anybody really care???'  For those who feel this album is too sugary, what is wrong with putting a little sweetness in this all too sour world?  I know I would much rather be taken this land of musical fantasy than being constantly bombarded with reality any day of the week!  Make my place STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER (too bad that wasn't added to this CD!...along with Penny Lane!)  Maybe next time this album's detractors should really listen to it...or perhaps I should say...tune in and turn on!  Think about it...if this album is indeed so bad, then why is it still being talked about and celebrated even 40 years later?  How many records live for 40 years???  What can you do but tip your hat, and I do indeed tip mine, proudly revealing my greying top, to GREATEST ROCK N ROLL BAND IN HISTORY for this masterpiece!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I am a person who LOVES horror movies that are \\"based on a real events.\\" This movie kicked my butt! I LOVED it! It does not seem overblown, melodramatic, or unrealistic. It spoke to my own set of beliefs and struck my spiritual core. It scared me to pieces (which is not easy to do) because it tells a story that is both plausible and deep. It is horrifyingly scary for a horror film, yet has a deep philosophical side. I love this movie. It is absolutely at the top of my favorite horror films.
0671042858|1.0|The only reason I read this book in the first place was because my husband is a big Red Sox fan and he wanted me to read it so I did.<br /><br />BEWARE!  Don't waste any time or money on this one!  The only positive thing I can say about this is that although I read it a long time ago, I still remember it.  However, not because it is any good, but rather because I felt so stupid for spending my time reading it.  It is hands down the dumbest book I ever read that I finished.  It was gross, disgusting, and moved very slowly (which I believe was purposeful to show how long it seemed to the girl to find her way out of the woods).  This was the first Stephen King book I ever read, and my last!  I couldn't understand why he is a best selling author and truly believe that if an unknown author wrote this, it would not even be published.  It was soooo boring!<br /><br />When I finally finished it, I was relieved I was done, shocked that the whole story was about the girl trying to find her way out of the woods and nothing really ever happened.  I kept reading only because I thought there must be more to it than just this, but there never was.  I was very disgusted that I wasted my time reading this!  I certainly don't recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Karen Arlettaz Zemek, author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\"
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Great to hear the E Street Band backin full swing!   As much as I have enjoyed his \\"solo\\" work (Tunnel of Love, Devils, Seeger's Sessions) there is still nothing like E Street Band.   Too bad this didn;t come out during the summer as tunes like \\"Girls...\\" and \\"Living in the Future\\" would have been perfect tunes for walking on the Boardwalk.    I don't understand so many of the reviews that complain about the \\"bad\\" sound.  Yes, it's dense but I think that's part of it's strengths.    Haven't had the chance to see him on tour yet, but from what a couple of friends tell me who have gone, the Magic songs blend in really well and it looks like a couple (Long Walk Home, Living,,,,) are becoming new trademark tunes..    For me, the big test is how a Bruce CD sounds in the car, driving at night.   This one aces the test!

0515123447|3.0|If I could give this book 3 1/2 stars I would.  I felt like the first 1/2 of the book moved too slow for me.  However, I do like how Jack Reacher gets the bad guys in the end.

1582701709|1.0|I borrowed the audiobook version from my library.  I waited almost three months for my name to crawl to the top of the list.  Within the first 15 minutes of the book, the author explains that negative thoughts attack more negativism.  The secret, in effect, is to think only positive things and great things will happen.  The author even demonstrates this in the book as people think one negative thought and several additional ones are overdubbed.<br /><br />So...I could have thought \\"Why did I wait so long for this book?\\"  This would have been negative.  Instead, I gave the book a shot and started repeating to myself, \\"I am so glad I waited for this book, I am so glad I waited for this book, I am so glad I waited for this book.\\"  Son of gun, it worked!  I suddenly realized that I borrowed the book from the library and didn't spend any money on it!  Good things happened for the rest of the day.<br /><br />Seriously, like another reader I would have liked to toss it out the car window.  Instead, I'll just take it back to the library today.<br /><br />Here's are a few \\"secrets\\".  You'll be wealthy (by about $15) if you read these and decide not to buy.<br /><br />Secret 1) Think happy thoughts because more happy thoughts will be attracted to the first happy thoughts.  All will be one in the universe and you'll make a lot of money.  In my opinion, this is the basic premise of the book.<br /><br />Secret 2) We all want the silver bullet that solves all of our problems.  Ms. Byrne apparently is masterful and building up hype around \\"the secret\\" and probably has made a ton of money by preying on our human weakness of wanting the secret answer.  I wonder how well she sleeps at night.<br /><br />Secret 3) Don't be surprised if in a few years, Ms. Byrne is selling \\"get rich quick programs\\" on late night TV since I'm sure this one worked for her.  She definitely has the experience.<br /><br />Secret 4) Harold Hill already figured this secret back in the late '50s.  His \\"think method\\" not only made him some cash, he got the girl in the end.  Not sure what I'm talking about here?  Buy a DVD of The Music Man.  That money will be much better spent.

B000VBJEEG|3.0|There's been a buy one, get one free deal on Disney movies in the UK recently. I treated myself to Robin Hood and Sword In The Stone. Those were the two I could find. The rest I had no interest in even picking up. Disney movies never appealed to me after Pocahontas came out, and I've rarely watched one since. The big movies recently have been the Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Cars etc, some with Pixar at the helm. But I never jumped at the chance to get any of them. They just didn't have the same appeal as the old Disney classics.<br /><br />Instead of sitting at home after a long day at work, I decided to go see this with my boyfriend, which meant lots of rushing about trying to make myself look presentable, but surprisingly worth it. Many of the people I work with know of my distaste for animation, and instantly said I wouldn't enjoy this.<br /><br />There were a handful of kids at the cinema. The rest were adults. I'm still not keen on being in the cinema with kids - there was a child a few rows in front of us, who got taken to the toilet a couple of times, but who was always away for at least 20 minutes! Why bother? And then there was the child who had a seriously high pitched laugh, and who I'm yet to figure out whether it was a boy or girl.<br /><br />Ratatouille surprised me, it really did. From the pre-credit sequence (something that doesn't seem to really match up to the rest of the movie) which was hilarious, to Remy, the rat with a taste for good cuisine, the movie was good. Slightly too long for my taste, I was starting to get restless, but it was funny, and well done. The pre-credit sequence with the aliens, was so funny, and I've been walking around the day after seeing it, and laughing to myself.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this was the lack of real celebrity voices. There were three I could pick out, maximum. Peter O'Toole was the voice of Anton Ego, Janeane Garofalo was the voice of Collette, and Jamie Oliver (famous British chef) is the voice of the health inspector. Normally these days every character is voiced by a celebrity.<br /><br />The plot is quite funny, although will make you hungry, but I won't give any of it away here. There is a story behind this, which is basically don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something. You can and you will. I thought it was quite subtle. It is quite simplistic at the same time, from the animation style, to the story. Whether it will become a classic I don't know, but I've added the DVD to my wishlist, as I really want to watch that pre-credit sequence again. I can't persuade anyone to go see this film, I wouldn't have managed to persuade ME to go see this film, but I like it when I get surprised by a movie I wouldn't have thought I would have liked.mally these days every character is voiced by a celebrity.

0618680004|5.0|Though I agree with where Dawkins is coming with his book I do not agree with it.  How can I give Dawkings 5 stars and disagree with him.  I'm a Christian.<br /><br />As such, I realize that Dawkins was created for a purpose - even if that is to challenge faith.  In the challenging of faith he opens doors whereby we, Christians, are challenged to respond - either in kind; or, in malice.<br /><br />I choose kindness.  I do not know how Dawkins grew up, what influenced him , how it is to live like he does right now, what he is going through - in effect, I cannot judge Dawkins the man.  All I can do is read his book and understand more about the man.  But I will never dream as he dreams, wonder as he wonders, nor postulate as he does.  I can only wish him well.<br />I can hope and pray that one day (as he will, as we all will) when he meets his Creator - he'll have a flashing insight to His son - Jesus, when He died for all of our sins, those committed, those thought of, and those to be, yet, done.  And in that moment, he'll too have, at that time, the choice - \\"wow, you really did that for - even me, one who wrote against you all that time?\\"<br /><br />Jesus:  \\"Yep Richard, just like I forgave Saul even when he was running around persecuting and killing Jews.  Now come, let's sit down over there with Einstein and Edison and, since we have FOREVER - see what we can continue to create - minus evil and sin and death and all that.  After all, we have all the time.\\"

I can bump every single track on it except \\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\" he got stupid on that track, I mean it grows on you but every time you hear it its like what was Kanye thinking. But overall the album is fire, but the CD is missing two tracks that you only get through iTunes.... or that \\"other method\\", which are Bittersweet Poetry feat. John Mayer, and Good Night feat. Mos Def, both are must hears. I strongly suggest you buy this album, its Kanye in his prime. Also I bought 50's album too....it was OK nothing to get excited about its pretty much the same ol' 50 guns crack and getting money no substance, Graduation was way better.

1932907009|3.0|There is one major problem I have with this book: The author uses examples that are Hollywood's greatest films like Miss Congeniality and Blank Check and avoids the trivial commercial garbage like Chinatown or Apocalypse Now. There is even a great blurb about Momento that ultimately says that 'if the suits don't understand it, then it must be garbage.'<br /><br />Bad examples aside, here are the two points I agree with: today's Hollywood is concerned with two things, the log line and the poster. The current thought is that if they can get butts into seats on opening weekend they will have ripped off most of the suckers before bad word of mouth can spread.<br /><br />So maybe the title should read 'How to Make More of the Same.' The problem is that these types of books get into inexperienced hands and are taken as gospel truth killing anything that doesn't follow the model. Script readers in this town are full of the same soundbytes taken from the three gospels of McKee, Field & Snyder.<br /><br />Okay, so I liked the book and suggest that any serious screenplay writer out there read it along with all the others. But don't read this one first! And don't bother reading it twice. You may end up thinking that hit films are due to formula instead of MASSIVE advertising campaigns. On that note, a must read is Marketing to Moviegoers by Robert Marich.<br /><br />Much of the information is opinion that could have been in an article of a screenwriter's magazine. In essence it could have been a pamphlet that accompanied Syd Field's Screenwriter's Handbook and I wouldn't have noticed a difference. I would give this book away after my first read, but you might have to pry the Screenwriter's Handbook from my cold, dead hands.<br /><br />Just like my review, it's long-winded and full of contradiction, but might be of some use to somebody.

0694003611|5.0|This seemingly simple book is my son's absolute favorite! I had no idea it would be such a hit, now I know why its a classic.     The illustrations are very simple and seem old fashion compared to most newer books out there. The colors you see on the cover are all the colors you'll find inside the book. And the pages do alternates between color and black & white, and yet... this book is completely adored by my 17 month son.      Great for bonding. He hands this book to any relative or friend he sees and then settles himself in their lap for a reading. I've never seen my child more animated with a book.    He roars \\"balloon!\\" and points to the drawing of the red balloon and also says 'chairs', 'mush' and 'hush' and yes, he was only 17 months old. :)   He just loves it, I often see him flipping thru the book on his own.       We have the lapbook edition with is also a boardbook but much bigger, however I would recommend buying this version.      The Lap book is difficult for my son to pick up and 'read' by himself and has gotten very bent up because of his laying on one side while trying to read the opposite page. Also the lap version is too big to throw in the diaper bag.      I also recommend purchasing the HBO special on DVD \\"Goodnight Moon and Other Sleepytime Tales\\".    [[ASIN:B0007N19BY Goodnight Moon and Other Sleepytime Tales]]    My son saw this after we bought the book and it was so neat to see him run and get his book, making the connection between the book and the visuals in the dvd.       The dvd is completely wonderful in its own right. It features Susan Sarandon telling the goodnight moon story twice, in the beginning and the end of the dvd. She is an excellent narrator. :)   The goodnight moon graphics are the exact same as the book but are animated, just a little bit.      It also features Tony Bennet singing Dreamland, Lauren Hill singing Hush Little Baby, Natalie Cole, Aaron Neville and my son's favorite song on the dvd, Twinkle Tinkle Little Star sung by Patty LaBelle. My son says 'tinkle!' whene he knows its coming and actually sings along! The visuals are gorgeous of a little girl playing among the stars.      Over all the dvd is very soothing, my son watches/listens to it after his dinner as a wind down and before we read him the Goodnight Moon book and tuck him into his crib. :)  Buy this book and also buy the dvd, your child will love them both.
B000654OUG|5.0|This set takes its place among the finest recorded performances of these works.

Wonderful listening for any lover of Schubert or piano music.
B00005JPD0|1.0|I was remarkably let down by this sneaky little beast of a film. I am unsure if I am the only one who found it to be the epitomy of subversive govermental propaganda, but the duelling themes of \\"patriotic unity in the face of a bloodthirsty onslaught from the 'home-grown terrorist' sector\\", coupled with the usual improbable reaches made by the \\"science as God\\" camp, left me cringing at the likely probability of a nieve American public gobbling up this slop.<br /> One point in particular, was the unashamed manner in which this film was supposedly filmed in New Orleans, yet not once did they show the devastation the aftermath of Katrina has had, and is continuing to have, on the region and its' people. Instead we see a sign on the military ship which was subsequently destroyed, saying, \\"Katrina only made us stronger.\\" Who is this \\"us\\"? You mean the U.S. military, who holds overt blame, under a multitude of evidence pointing to weak, poorly structured, and purposefully destroyed levees, for the majority of the destruction to the region? Nice \\"foot-to-the-throat\\" of the poor citizens of a once grand, and culturally rich sector of our country.<br />Other little flag-sucking messages are sprinkled throughout, viewable to the alert and observant, such as the \\"Support Our Troops\\" sticker clearly visible in one scene. Yes, \\"support your troops\\", the thin line between caring for the poor misguided or desperate grunts (of which I was one, before realizing the sham I was involved in) who signed up out of economic despair, illusions of grandeur, or Unca Sam's college money, (treacherous bait to lure the desperate to the front lines, i.e the multitude of \\"National Guard\\" and \\"Reserves\\" deployed OVERSEAS in the war zone)and supporting the heinous attrocities of one's government.<br /> Then there is the subject of the whole time travel debacle, where large leaps of faith and stretches in reason are depicted as a scientific and technological possibility, instead of the pure egg-headed, jerk-fest, fantasy they represent. Large leaps of reason go unquestioned, when we're on the journey we predestined, viewed purely as entertainment, it was a success, a meal for the mind, lacking the soul's substance.<br /> Ohh whoa whoa its magiccc! An approach to time-tavel as a realistic, technological probability, that rings as true to me, as an evolutionary theory that states as fact, our arrival here as 'modern man', in a complex and intricate universe, which we as humans still know so little about, as a miracle of chance. Res Ipsa Loquitur, as Hunter would say.<br /> The ending, in particular, attempted to tear credible rationale from my brains, which were already cowering in the wake of such a vicious beating. K, he was transported, by the souped-up zapper, back in time. Which eliminates his \\"present-self\\", correct? So, during the rescue, his \\"time-travelling-self\\" drowns, yet he reappears later on shore, re-united with his love-interest. That point in the timeline is still in the past people! So WTF? What of his \\"present-self\\"? Is it dead? Is he now doomed to live out his days, three days or so in the past? F*** me. My cranium erupts and out sputters a warm goo. I lap it up greedily because it tastes like chicken. Amen.<br /> Also of note to my fellow \\"free-thinking radicals\\", the cliched lines muttered by the traiterous Jim Cavietzel, in defense of his treachery. Only a flag-sucking ignorant could set up such weak-minded dialogue from a character who suredly would have had much more, or far less to say, on the subject of tyrants and kings. Another wet-dream, patriotic jerk-fest, tackled with an O'Reillian passion, how enforcer Denzel, \\"The Protector\\" shuts him down with pre-formed government lines, intent on making the \\"insurgent\\" Cavietzel look like an ill-informed goon, self-righteous and self-centered. Something about the tree of freedom being watered by the blood of the innocents. Crap propaganda. Spoken as a freely admitting insurgent against our corrupt and oppressive regime, I would state, at best, that the tree of freedom be watered by the blood of tyrants and kings, but, in fact, most of us would agree that blood-shed on either side will in the end solve nothing, as one beast would simply replace another.<br /> I had high hopes for this movie, as I was surprised at how much I liked, \\"Enemy of the State\\" (Even under the torturous scenario of it starring the Prince of Bel-Air)from this director. If I had one gripe, I would like to switch Denzel, whom I generally like and respect as an actor, although I realize him to be not particularly enlightened, and Will Smith, who could then rank this film right up there with \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" as all-time great American propagandist films for the un-assuming masses.egime, I would state, at best, that the tree of freedom be watered by the blood of tyrants and kings, but, in fact, most of us would agree that blood-shed on either side will in the end solve nothing, as one beast would simply replace another.

B00081U7HC|4.0|Pretty Woman directed by Garry Marshall is a film no one should take too seriously. Julia Roberts became a star after this film, she plays a hooker who falls in love with Edward (Richard Gere). Vivian (Roberts) lacks manners, morals, and luck but things change once Edward opens her mind to different ways of life. This film is a modern-day Cinderella story but with a twist. Pretty Woman does lack engery at times but this movie is still enjoyable to watch.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|If you're reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall (\\"Six Feet Under\\") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.<br /><br />We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his \\"urges\\" and distinguish between good and evil.<br /><br />Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It's a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn't an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it's kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.<br /><br />You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.<br /><br />The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama \\"Brotherhood\\". We also get \\"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\\" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to \\"Dexter\\" because that's what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven't listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series \\"The Tudors\\" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that \\"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\\" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won't be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn't indicated on the package.<br /><br />We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.<br /><br />Minor Plot Spoilers:<br /><br />Dexter's father a police officer recognized early on his son's proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his \\"skills\\" to hunt down those that prey on others.<br /><br />Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he's not normal and he also knows he doesn't fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something \\"better\\".<br /><br />When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.<br /><br />END OF PLOT SPOILERS:<br /><br />Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used thenovel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons.novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point.

I'm a huge Beatle fan, but having all the material already, 'cept for the 5.1 mix, seems too pricey to me.  Where's the extra's???  Seems there should be much more for this price.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Okay, so. You're probably sick of all those campy films in this genre, right? There's just so many of them out there, each one getting progressively worse and worse and stealing ideas not so obliviously from the endeavor before it.    But what happens when you take a very likable group of actors and mix them with a sharp script, hip music, and a man called Shakespeare? You get this movie, of course! Finally, a movie in this genre that doesn't make you want to throw your DVD player out the window. The humor was so spot on and brilliant that I, at least, try and repeat many of the memorable quotes around just to see how many odd looks I get. If you want another reason to like this movie, let me just give you three words: Heath Ledger's hair.    Not a fan of Shakespeare, you say? Think William Shakespeare is the manager of your local Taco Bell? No problem, you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. Love Shakespeare to pieces and know every last detail right down to how many hairs he had on his head when he died? Perfect! You'll love this movie.    Now, I'm going to go buy some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments.
0060090367|4.0|Watermelon was another story of a wonderfully dysfunctional Irish family.  This is a fun, light book.  Claire's husband leaves her a few hours after delivering her first child.  Any woman's worst nightmare!  Marian Keyes manages to take this tragedy and turn it into a comedy and romance.  Claire moves back into her parents house and let the hilarity begin.  If this is your first Marian Keyes book, be forewarned, there ARE a lot of characters and family members to keep up with.  However if you like this family Marian Keyes has several more books to keep you up to date with the rest of this quirky yet loveable clan.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Addiction. I'm sure everyone has felt an addiction to something or other. Caffeine, chocolate, tv, sex and drugs, even, but there's such a rainbow of things people can feel addicted to. I have never seen addiction portrayed in a better, more haunting way than it's done in this movie. It may seem easy to not sympathize for these characters. \\"It's their own fault they got all muddled up in drugs, that could never be me,\\" or \\"this movie is stupid, the entire plot is about letting yourself go deeper and deeper into despair.\\" That may just be ignorance talking from someone who clearly doesn't understand just what addiction can do to people. This is a movie that's not supposed to be about confusing you with twists and turns and a whole gigantic plot that you didn't see coming, but it's supposed to make you feel, make you think, make you reminisce about your own life and the lives of those you love. It does just that perfectly.    Take Jared Leto, for example. Most people only see him as this one-dimensional guy who just happens to have a popular, talented band. They may not have realized that the skeletal Harry Goldfarb is actually Mr. Leto himself in a heart-wrenching role played to perfection. And \\"whoa isn't that the guy from those Scary Movie films?\\" Yes, yes it is. Ellen Burstyn was robbed of the Oscar that year, in my opinion, her story may just have been the saddest one yet. She deals with feelings of abandonment, self-worth, and loss.    This is a movie with a message that's more than \\"drugs are bad, k? Don't stick things in your arm.\\" We all learned this in the fourth grade. It's obvious. If a movie just pounded that into your head, I don't think it would be as well-liked as Requiem For A Dream is. The same can be said for the novel as well, really, which is also completely fascinating. There are differences between book and film, of course, but it's certainly one of the best book-to-movie endeavors. If you're easily squeamish or have a closed mind you may not like this film, but you really should give it a go. Even if you don't literally like it or if you get freaked out by it, you'll certainly still appreciate and admire it.
0060090383|2.0|I love Marian Keyes, however this was my least favorite book of hers. It was a long drawn out read.  Not very entertaining.  Sorry.
B00005JOHC|5.0|Jon Cryer, what else to say.great to watch when all else on TV is trash.
B000002C2E|5.0|Dylan´s the biggest artist of the century .  Time Out of Mind is one of his best records.  So= Time Oou of Mind is one the most biggest records ever.  I have no more to say.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I give up.    Look, I think we've all been reading Amazon reviews long enough to know that there are some really unbright people watching movies. Yet, most of the time, in the aggregate, the reviews will show via average rating whether a movie stinks or not. If a movie gets a 3 star average, it's a safe bet the movie is horrid. As I write this, \\"Death Proof\\" has a 3 star rating. That's insane. This is the best stuff I've seen in months. What a soundtrack. Great ironic dialogue. Superb video violence. Style out the wazoo, references all over the place laid down like easter eggs for those who are savvy enough to pick them up. There's nothing not to love about this movie, that is, if you even like moving pictures, ya know?    I'm going to take a guess and assume it is a combination of envious film geeks and the usual crowd of 'tards who don't know what entertainment is that is bringing this flick down. There also seems to be alot of consternation about breaking the Grindhouse double feature into two DVDs, so you have to factor that into the rating. This is so good, who cares? If you feel ripped off in that way, rent them both. Just see them, whatever you do.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|The Two Minute Warning might have been a better title for this film, as Next is the name of last years Michael Crichton novel, and \\"The Golden Man\\" the name of the story that the film was based on would be confusing. Philip K. Dick the late great Short Story writer, has been adapted many times in the last few years, trying to recapture the brilliance of \\"Blade Runner\\" (the adaptation of \\"do androids dream of electric sheep) which was in fact better than the story.<br /><br />Next almost (but not quite) triumphs, the writing is pretty good, but unfortunately the actors are never quite able to make it completely convincing or believable. After watching the DVD, I watched the interviews with the cast and saw that all they cast had to say was how great it was to work with Nick Cage. Cage, who really did the best job in the film, but listening to him talk... He clearly didn't understand the concepts involved in the film, and with all the other actors taking the lead from him, the shortcomings were understandable.<br /><br />Still, this is a pretty good DVD, (with some original concepts, picking up on the girl, and the fighting were especially interestingly done) when compared to what is out there, so if you like movies with an element of ESP, you should enjoy this just fine. I'd just advise you to skip the commentary
1565114205|5.0|There are literally 1000's of sales books out there, but this is like no other.  Its not so much a 'how to' book, but more like 'The Millionaire Next Door' for sales.  Here is what the top producers do, here are the facts, do whatever you want, we don't care.  Not fancy closes, secret words to put in your presentation, nothing like that.  It truly is like no other sales book and I have listened to the audio version 3 times since I bought it and have picked up something new everytime.
B000065V41|5.0|The Muppet Christmas Carol is a perfect balance of adult understanding and fanciful childhood dreams of Christmas. I thought Michael Caine was a wonderful actor before, but I don't think there could be a better portrayal of Scrooge, especially considering that over half of the cast is muppets.  The original songs written by Paul Williams could not be anymore touching. My favorites being \\"Bless Us All\\" (at the Hatchet's house) and \\"It Feels Like Christmas\\" (Christmas Present).    This movie is a MUST HAVE for anyone who loves Christmas and wants to keep it in their heart the whole year through.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Do yourself a favor and watch all the extras...lots of new information since the feature film release.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|How's this going to be different than last year's version released by the Criterion Collection and still for sale here?:      http://www.amazon.com/Jimi-Plays-Monterey-Shake-Otis/dp/B000E5LEW4/ref=sr_1_14/104-2206836-2621542?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1192285295&sr=1-14    If it's anything like CC, I give it 5 stars although this version's not out yet.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|If you are a fan of Pink Floyd and/or Syd Barrett, this is a no-brainer. I would recommend the deluxe version here because when you have every Pink Floyd release ever, this will bring something you won't already own. First of all, the packaging is phenomenal. It looks like a hardcover book from some old library. There are photos inside that have never been released before and a few of the same old reprints.       As far as the music content, it is always fun to listen to something in mono if you are like me and weren't even born when it was released originally. The stereo remix reveals things I haven't heard before even after listening to the remastered single disc edition a thousand times. Disc #3 is whole reason for all of this 40th anniversary stuff. As always, EMI finally let go of the few studio outtakes they've been sitting on that us fans have been drooling over the chance to hear. There is a cool alternate version of Matilda Mother that really surprised me as well as alternate takes of Intersteller Overdrive that reveals to me that the peice was evolving rapidily with each take. You can see why the album version is the one used because by take 6, it is virtually a different experience other that the opening hook riff. I would recommend this highly to anyone who is amazed by the short-lived genius of Syd and this is a great snapshot of 1967-circa Floyd.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I watched this movie within hours of watching 'The Illusionist'. I think I have had my fill of \\"magic\\" for a while. 'The Prestige' is a superior film to 'The Illusionist' in many ways. It was not as easy to see where it was going and the characters were more fleshed out. I did find it a little too long and tedious, with a trim here and there it would have made this a much better film. Movies like this are spoiled by the surprise ending so, rent this don't buy it. 3 1/2 stars for keeping me guessing to the end.
B000IFQLSW|3.0|On a scale of 1-10 I rate this a 7, It was not exactly what I thought it would be. The concept of honoring the \\"gray beards\\" of Blues was on the money but I wanted more uptempo from Kenny. Only a few cuts really highlited his guitar work.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|I watched this film knowing nothing about it,yet I was able to tell what was going to happen at many key instances of the film. Even though it is predictable, I thought the story was pretty good. I just didn't think the characters were well developed and the love between the two stars was not convincing. They show the two lovers as children for a matter of minutes and I didn't really see why the bond was so strong. It's an OK movie that I would never watch again because once the secrets out, there is nothing more to hold your interest. It's worth a rental.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|The new Bruce Springsteen album is pretty good.  I always thought he was wasting away his years with uninteresting vocal melodies.  Well, not so with this new release titled \\"Magic\\".  The sound of a couple songs such as \\"Radio Nowhere\\" might remind you of something from the Born in the USA album, seeing as how that song would fit in perfectly with that album or anything else from the mid 80's.  A good effort for vocal melody lovers.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|The earth goes through cyclical changes in climate periodically. About 10,000 years ago the earth went through it's last ice age, where North America was covered by ice, and this had nothing to do with man-made carbon emissions. The sea level fell by 120m during the last ice age. The earth is constantly changing between glacial and interglacial periods naturally without the influence of man. I'd save your money and buy something truly educational, like [[ASIN:0764574817 Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering]]    P.S. The sky is falling!!!!
B0002OERI0|4.0|While many people have criticized me for thinking American Idiot is Green Day's best album, I will continue to listen to it anyway because the vocal melodies are extremely catchy, and even though the sound of the album overall is very commercialized, that doesn't interfere with my enjoyment at all.  The songwriting really feels like it's better than ever before.  \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is probably the best song.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I first discovered Paulo Nutini at the Live Earth Concert.  His cover of a Wonderful World was incredible!  It made me want to learn more about him.  So I went out and bought These Streets, and  immediately became hooked.  His songs are mesmerizing... he sings from the heart about love, about love lost, all with a wonderful raspy, soulful, voice which will haunt you.  The more I listen, the more I yearn for more.  I recently saw him in concert, which was amaxing.  You won't regret buying this CD.  I look forward to his next one.  He also does some great covers. This is an extremely talented young man who should be watched very closely.
B00008WT5E|5.0|I believe this is AC/DC's most underrated album.  Almost nothing from this album receives any radio play, which is extremely unfortunate as the quality of the songwriting and the familiar and distinct hard rock sound that made AC/DC legendary has remained firmly intact.  AC/DC is one hard rock band that wasn't affected by the disco scene at ALL.  Great songs, especially the very heavy \\"Riff Raff\\" and the slow bluesy \\"Down Payment Blues\\".  Check out the awesome album cover as well.
0525950079|4.0|As most people know, World Without End is a sequel to Pillars of the Earth. I read Pillars about 16 years ago, and was mesmerized by it, and it's been one of my all time favorite books ever since. When I heard there was to be a sequel I pre-ordered it right away.    I'm sure other Pillars... fans will want to know: is it as good as the original? In my opinion...almost, but not quite.     The author does manage to bring 14th century Knightsbridge as much to life as he did the 12th century Knightsbridge of Pillars. It's a couple of centuries older, bigger, more crowded, and more cumbersome; the priory is no longer run by visionaries like Prior Phillip, but by conservative, small minded men. The great cathedral is showing some cracks (literally and figuratively). There are conflicts between the merchants of the town and the monks, and there's also a new element - a convent of nuns that is wealthier and better managed than the monastery.     I guess that the more complex (even muddled) society of the 14th century is one reason why World Without End a bit less enjoyable than Pillars. The characters are in a lot more shades of grey. The building of a bridge and the repairing and renovation of the cathedral are less awe-inspiring perhaps than the building of a cathedral from the ground up. So you feel that the characters are a bit less small, a bit less challenged.     One factor that had the possibility of challenging this society in a huge way was the plague (the Black Death), but I felt that the plague part of the book was a bit rushed through, or dealt with a bit lightly. (I got the feeling that the author cared a lot more about describing the bridge construction than the parts about the plague, which may account for that feeling of uneven weightedness.) It didn't seem that earth shaking in the course of events somehow - though it does show how the plague pushed some people up the ranks of society far quicker than would have been expected, often undeservedly.     Ultimately this book pales a bit in comparison to Pillars of the Earth because it lacks the larger than life characters that dominated that book - Jack, Aliena, and in particular Prior Phillip. (There's a paler version of Jack, a different-but-equal, sort of, version of Aliena, a very similar version of William...and no equivalent really to Phillip.) The characters in World Without End are appealing, but not unforgettable.     That being said, it is still an excellent book, and I hope Mr. Follett decides to write more historical fiction.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|This is a classic in every since of the word. The story is great, with Grant playing an average businessman who is thrust into an adventure he wants no part of. There is lots of action ending with the famous confrontation on the faces of Mount. Rushmore. Great performances by Cary Grant, James Mason, Martin Landau, Eva Marie Saint and Jessie Royce Landis make this movie one of my favorites.
B0000AK7AB|4.0|Some films are so enjoyable that it is nearly impossible not to smile through them as they teach subtle lessons, and Babe is one of the best. It is the odd being that can't laugh at the antics of the animals of Farmer Hoggit's farm as Ferdinand, a duck tries to usurp the role of the rooster, three literate musical mice read title cards aloud for younger audience members, and best of all, Babe, a Hoy piglet, learns the job of the brilliant herding dogs, Rex and Fly, to win the annual sheep herding competition.     Clever animation, well done animatronic creature-doubles by Jim Henson's studio, and a menagerie of superbly trained real farm animals makes the superior story of the little piggie who could more than just a cute bacon for breakfast situation.  A film for the entire family, it is simple and underscores the notion that hard work and tolerance for those different from oneself are to be respected in the kingdom of all animals.  Babe brings to the screen through comedy and drama, life lessons that all ages can understand without being preachy or didactic.  One cheers for the farmer and his porker as they challenge the conventions and expectations with subtle humor and respect.    As the piglet grows bigger through the great job of fattening up by Mrs. Hoggit, he makes friends with an elderly ewe who conveys much wisdom about the rules of farm life, where Rex is the dominant dog, and the sheep are considered ignorant. However, Farmer Hoggit and Babe share a special relationship that confounds his wife, the sheep dogs, and the sheep. He trains Babe how to herd sheep and he's a mighty smart and fast learner, ultimately changing the rules that dominated the pecking order of the barnyard motto - \\"because that's the way it's always been\\" with his good manners and friendship.    James Cromwell as Farmer Arthur Hoggit gives an understated, superb performance as the patient farmer who is willing to give a young pig a chance. This is one of the most delightful family films and perfect for seasonal get-togethers, or just because it's a nice change to see film devoid of inane car chases, mindless explosions, and peppered with four letter words, yet, adult in its message.  Every home library should have its own copy of little Babe, a Pig of Destiny.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This CD is so wonderfully crafted. The guitar work is very fresh and demanding. Myles Kennedy's voice blends well with the band, they have clearly have a chemistry in the way they work together. The lyrics are uplifting and positive, which is sometimes a relief. It's also great to play Halo 3 too, it's very agressive and powerful. I consider as good if not better than 2004's debut \\"One Day Remains.\\"
B000EXZ9P4|3.0|Here's the deal : you have to be a country music lover. Each of these songs separately is excellent; the first four songs alone are a mini-Knopfler CD of the highest quality, and could easily fit on Dire Straits albums, perhaps especially the rockabilly-tinged \\"On Every Street.\\" On \\"This Is Us,\\" the tempo is vintage Straits, Knopfler's elegant and melodious guitarwork is superb throughout the album, restrained and elegant yet as essential as a blistering solo from his rock heyday. After those first four songs, though... as I said: you have to love country music. Personally, I begin to not doze off but be so bored that I wish I could doze off.   Harris seems to specialize in adding her Nashville cachet and golden pipes to ageing rockers these days, but she does much more for Knopfler than she did for Neil Young. Her voice is so different from Knopfler's that, although at first she seems to play second banana to his overwhelming presence, slowly you realize that she brings a whole new dimension to his mournful, somewhat monotonous voice. If I could digest a full hour of country without getting a rash, I would give this five stars. I can't, so here's three, hoping this assessment is helpful to those who feel the way I do.
1572815108|5.0|This edition of the Crowley Thoth Tarot has \\"standard\\" size cards smaller than the usual large edition, measuring 2-7/8\\" x 4-3/8\\". This is probably a better size for doing readings. The larger size cards are fine for meditation and ritual use, but too cumbersome for reading purposes. Also, this edition comes in a large box, with the deck in its own smaller box, a 20\\" x 17\\" Celtic Cross layout sheet, and a small 48 page instruction booklet. Although this edition is printed in Belgium, it comes with the two extra Magus cards normally found in the Swiss decks, and does not include the OTO cards.<br /><br />The Thoth deck was designed by Aleister Crowley, and painted by Lady Frieda Harris. The project spanned some five years, from 1938 to 1943, and it might be instructive to think about what was happening in the world during that time. Crowley was a member of the Golden Dawn, a secret society that pursued occult studies and magickal workings based in part upon the ancient Hebrew Cabala. The GD had its own Tarot deck, based upon its cabalistic teachings, which was given to initiates who were required to make their own copies, and who often did so with their own embellishments -- not surprising, since at that time there were no copy machines. Members were sworn to secrecy regarding the deck itself, but several members, including Crowley and Arthur Edward Waite, later designed and published decks based on the order's symbolism. Crowley eventually split with the GD, founding several orders of his own, among which the OTO -- Ordo Templi Orientis -- still exists and operates. In 1904, Crowley had a mystical experience of sorts, which fundamentally changed the way he looked at the world, and influenced all of his writings thereafter, including his Tarot. For this reason, there are significant differences between Crowley's Tarot and other Tarots based on the GD system.<br /><br />The deck itself is of the usual Tarot structure, having 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana. The court cards are rearranged to suit the esoteric GD interpretations. The court cards are Knight, Queen, Prince, and Princess. The Kings of the old packs are renamed Princes, and shown seated in chariots, to reflect the GD's assignment of them to elemental Air.<br /><br />What makes these cards truly unique is their abstract imagery. While the deck is fully illustrated, the cards do not have the \\"personalized\\" illustrations found in the Rider-Waite-Smith deck. With the exception of the court cards, the Arcana in the GD system were never intended to represent persons, or their personal characteristics. They were intended to represent the impersonal forces and energies described by the Cabala, as understood by the Order's initiates. The design of the Crowley deck helps to avoid the trap into which readers of the Rider-Waite deck all too often fall -- projecting one's personal beliefs and characteristics into the cards, and winding up believing the cards are all about one's own personality and beliefs. It is easy to fall into that trap using cards that are illustrated with human figures, as are the Rider-Waite. Whether Waite did that intentionally, to hide the true meaning of the cards from the uninitiated, or because he really was the mental baboon Crowley thought he was, is difficult to say. I suspect neither -- Waite probably thought he was doing everyone a real favor by making the Tarot accessible, while at the same time honoring his Oath of Secrecy. In any case, the effect has been to lead readers and students down the very path the GD sought to avoid. The Tarot, at least in the initiated system of the GD and its offshoots, is an esoteric system that yields insights into otherwise invisible forces and events. It has nothing to do with \\"counseling,\\" \\"personal growth,\\" \\"empowerment,\\" or any of the other absurdities with which the nihilism of modern revisionists has associated it.<br /><br />That makes the Thoth deck one of the best to learn with, assuming one wants to learn the Tarot as its designers in the esoteric tradition intended it. Its imagery is abstract, symbolic, suggestive, and evocative. Lady Harris is often given short shrift in terms of her esoteric knowledge, but any serious study of the deck will show that her ability to translate the abstract and complex ideas of both the Order's teachings, and Crowley's elaborations thereupon, is nothing short of genius.<br /><br />The booklet that comes with the deck is, in actuality, an excellent introduction to the cards and how to read them. It contains the original essay by James Wasserman, accompanied by two essays written by Lady Harris herself, which together give some excellent insights into the cards and their interpretation. The title page indicates that it has been \\"edited and updated\\" -- uhh-ohh, when I read that, I can't help thinking of the Grand Inquisitor's \\"We have corrected thy work!\\" There is a little of that, but no real harm done.<br /><br />Those who would like further information on the use of the Tarot in the Golden Dawn tradition will find [[ASIN:0877283702 Introduction to the Golden Dawn Tarot]] and [[ASIN:0971559139 The Qabalistic Tarot: A Textbook of Mystical Philosophy]], both by Dr. Robert Wang, excellent sources.

B000006MV8|5.0|I loved everything about this CD.  I liked every song on here, though Joey Molland's SUITCASE sounded better on the bonus track than the George Harrison album version.  Remastered digitally, this album featured hits like DAY AFTER DAY and BABY BLUE, a medley of MONEY and FLYING, a great piano tune called TAKE IT ALL, and Tom Evans' IT'S OVER.  A great CD overall.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This is a wonderful CD by Bruce Springsteen, with the welcome and accomplished backing by the E Street Band.  He has not worked with this group so much over the past two decades.  But the partnership here richly pays off in this latest work by Springsteen.  There is a sensibility to this album that hearkens back to earlier classics, such as \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Born in the USA\\" and Darkness on the Edge of Town.\\"<br /><br />A few cuts illustrate the tonality of this work.<br /><br />The CD begins with a classic up tempo rocker, \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" that one will easily remember after having listened to it.  The E Street Band does great work here.  The guitar work, for instance, is terrific (the band features the following on guitar, Springsteen, of course, the redoubtable Stevie Van Zandt, and the talented Nils Lofgren). A couple lines say it all:<br /><br />\\"This radio nowhere<br />Is there anybody alive out there?<br />. . . .<br />I just want to hear some rhythm<br />. . . .<br />I want a thousand guitars<br />I want pounding drums\\"<br /><br />Another interesting cut is \\"Livin' in the Future,\\" which has its predecessors on other CDs from his period with the E Street Band.  The E Street Band here does its work in its own inimitable style.  Clemons sax work is as advertised.  Some of the suggestive and evocative lines:<br /><br />\\"A letter come blowin' in on an ill wind<br />Somethin' `bout me and you<br />Never seein' one another again.<br />. . . .<br />Don't worry darlin',<br />Now baby don't you fret<br />We're livin' in the future and<br />None of this has happened yet.\\"<br /><br />\\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\" is a bittersweet song.  Some gloom here: \\"And tonight I'm gonna burn this town down,\\" \\"Things been a little tight, but I know they're gonna turn my way\\" [a negative thought, but then an optimistic note, a telling recurring theme in Springsteen's corpus], and \\"Love's a fool's dance.\\"  There is some great imagery about a diner.<br /><br />Then, \\"Magic.\\" There are interesting images of magic, with some modest sense of foreboding.  This is a soft, almost hypnotic, tune.<br /><br />\\"Long Walk Home.\\"  This begins with a plaintive note:<br /><br />\\"Last night I stood at your doorstep<br />Trying to figure out what went wrong.\\"<br /><br />This is another song about a home town, evoking recollections of earlier of his songs on the same theme.  Once more, vivid images of his home town abound. There is a gritty realism to the lyrics, reinforced by the music itself. Great work by the E Street Band, with special mention for the sax and guitar playing.<br /><br />And, then, as sometimes happens in CDs these days--an untitled song not listed on the \\"liner notes.\\"  There are interesting references to art works, engineering feats, and someone who \\"broke the mold.\\" This is more akin to his recent acoustic and folk CDs.  An interesting piece.<br /><br />So, how to rate this work?  If you like the Springsteen of the glory days of his alliance with the E Street Band, you'll enjoy this CD.  It works very well and is a good addition to his oeuvre.ne.    \\"Long Walk Home.\\"  This begins with a plaintive note:    \\"Last night I stood at your doorstep  Trying to figure out what went wrong.\\"    This is another song about a home town, evoking recollections of earlier of his songs on the same theme.

Great work by the E Street Band, with special mention for the sax and guitar playing.    And, then, as sometimes happens in CDs these days--an untitled song not listed on the \\"liner notes.\\"  There are interesting references to art works, engineering feats, and someone who \\"broke the mold.\\" This is more akin to his recent acoustic and folk CDs.  An interesting piece.    So, how to rate this work?  If you like the Springsteen of the glory days of his alliance with the E Street Band, you'll enjoy this CD.  It works very well and is a good addition to his oeuvre.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|The recent legal judgement in the United Kingdom against former Vice-President Gore for unethical data analysis in this film does not help the global warming religious movement.  The film can no longer be shown in U.K. schools unless they point out the falsehoods.
0736063684|5.0|I have to say I was most impressed with this book and was exactly what I was looking for.  It shows *exactly* what muscles are worked with each different exercise- which is a great help for muscle isolation.    Over the years I have tried working out, but really had no clue how to properly perform the exercises or exactly what muscle was being worked. This book definitely tells you how to properly do the exercise, what muscles are being worked, and even alternative ways of doing the same exercise.    Definitely worth the price!
6305949980|5.0|every year around September I start to watch this film. And I watch it alot! This movie has great replay value. Its a little graphic for some small children, but it is a Disney film so children can watch it with Parents in my opinion. The prefect film for a Halloween movie fest!
B000I0QM0E|5.0|Since silly Paramount were bought out & forced onto poor, dear sad old HD ( for the time being ) I decided to snap-up this quality Blu-ray version of Sleepy Hollow, post haste!<br /><br />It won't be released on Blu-Ray again ( until silly Paramount go back to the winning team ) so if you own a Blu-ray player and would like this Tim Burton classic, then its best to grab it now.<br /><br />As usual, since Blu-Ray bonus features are still just starting out, extras are exactly the same as on the old DVD. But its nice to watch the film in pristine clarity.<br /><br />5 stars for the film, 5 stars for it being on Blu-Ray,<br />everything else is just by the by.<br /><br />Hooray for Sleeping Hollow on Blu-Ray, Woo.<br /><br />As a side-note, it works on Australian Blu-Ray players, since the disc itself isn't region locked to Region A. It won't come out in Australia<br />on Blu-ray ( anytime soon, that is ) so snap it up off Amazon if you're a Burton fan.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Since when does the Nobel Peace committee award their prize based on a sophistic work like this film?  The movie certainly makes some plausible points, but there is plenty of scientific evidence by learned scholars to the contrary.  Unfortunately, not everyone is an ex-vice-president with ties to just about every person of note in Hollywood.  They haven't a chance in hell of getting their views out there with the kind of backing that Al Gore had for this film.  It's not even the film that irks me as much as the man got a Nobel Peace Prize for it.  That's just wrong, especially when you compare Al Gore to another Democrat Nobel Peace Prize winner like, say, Jimmy Carter who has REALLY done some amazing things with his life. VERY FRUSTRATING.

0316067598|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It will make you smile, laugh, mad and cry! What an amazing team! So brave, so tough! After reading this book, you'll feel like you know each of them, from their light hearted comments to their sheer toughness and commitment to each other and to our country. The public needs to know how the Rules of Engagement are affecting our troops, these rules were probably what cost these men their lives. All Americans should be outraged at our politicians for these ROE's!
B000URDEB0|2.0|Being a big Nightwish fan for several years, I was curious how the new CD would sound.  The music is ok, but I still prefer the Oceanborn and Wishmaster era music. The over use of orchestration and chorus with metal makes me think that Megadeth joined forces with Yanni.  Anette has a really nice voice but I do not believe that it fits Nightwish.  I was hoping for a voice more like Floor Jansen.  This music can not be played live so they will do what they did for the Once tour, they will play along with a soundtrack.  This is the main issue I have with Nightwish, they no longer play concerts, they play along with a karaoke track.  All the complex synth, backing voices, choir and orchestrations are prerecorded and they play along with that.  I was disappointed with the Once tour because half the concert was prerecorded tracks. Just check out the End of an Era DVD.  And this album is even more produced and overlaid than Once. Saying that, the album is worth a listen, it just won't get many rotations in the CD player.  Once last thing, say goodbye to ever hearing Wishmaster and Kinslayer live.  I don't think those will sound good with Anette's voice.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Man, I can't believe the amount of people that miss the point of this amazing movie. I guess I benefit from being exposed to many a drive-in movie while growing up (Including one of my fav's, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry).    Even if you don't have the patience to just embrace the experience that Tarantino has so beautifully crafted, how can you NOT be blown away by the jaw-dropping set pieces: the lap dance; the car chase.    Sorry, you won't find this kind of stuff on YouTube, if that's what you're basing your opinions on. Hey I'm glad to be in the minority here, b/c I think Robert Rodriguez sucks and so many people loved sin city.
B000S0GYRU|2.0|This flick is completely lost on me.  Lugubrious plotting with an ocassional shocking scene to enliven the proceedings.  Even these scenes that were meant to shock are tedious and amateurish.  I'd give this flick one star but it was too boring for me to truly hate.
B00005JPRF|5.0|This was an awesome movie.  It moved a little fast, but otherwise, it's great.  I really enjoyed imagining the apocalypse themes and being part of the story.  Iain Glen made it all worth while, as he always does.  This was a splendid film, but should have been longer, not so rushed.  I enjoyed it, and saw it more than once.  It was fantastic and brilliant.  I love the story!  The book is good, too.  I love the Resident Evil series.   Really wonderful Extinction movie!  Worth buying on DVD!
B000BYA5G4|4.0|Andrew Niccol's account of International arms dealing never fails to entertain, but, alas, doesn't hit the homerun.  I have been a big fan of Niccol's previous forays in paranoia.  \\"The Truman Show\\" and \\"Gattaca\\" are masterpieces.  Heck, I even liked \\"S.I.M.O.N.E\\".  Despite some bullseyes Niccol doesn't seem to focus his arguments here, therefore, he can't ratchet the sufficient outrage against the death merchants in our midst.  What redeems the film is Nicolas Cage's charasmatic turn as Yuri who enters into arms dealing as a lark and dicovers he's just so damned good at it.  A great scene in the film is where Yuri is stuck in an African village with a planeload of munnitions.  With Interpol on his tail he proceeds to empty out the contents of the plane by giving it away to the natives.  Not bad, but could have better.
B000WSHF4E|5.0|Cate Blanchett has outdone even her own self.She has mastered a role that many actresses have also played,but SHE has become Her Royal Majesty Elizabeth even more so in Shekhar Kapur's newest installment ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE than she was in the first ELIZABETH in 1998.Blanchett is the perfect combination of ice and fire,vulnerability and bullheadedness,sensitivity and rageaholic and masculine and feminine to bring England's savior to the screen.Ms.Blanchett is so in control of herself that the corset  stays tied, but the fear and passion always dwell just below the surface.She is Queen.At one point,Blanchett,in a rage at the Spanish Ambassador screams \\"I have a hurricane within me\\"....and she does,because Blanchett does.  Blanchett may well see her first BEST ACRESS Oscar this year.She has a Golden Globe and another win would be no surprise.This film has many magnificent qualities going for it,but ultimately it is Cate Blanchett's astute and finely tuned skills as an actress par excellent that carry this film to victory.  The year is 1585.Spain is eying the English throne.Sequestered up in Fartheringay Castle in Scotland,Mary Stuart the Queen of Scotland (an amazing and convincing Samantha Morton performance as always) also has her own designs to usurp Elizabeth,\\"that bastard whore.\\" Elizabeth is still advised by her chief counselor Francis Walsingham (again Geoffrey Rush reprising his brilliant role from the original).Walsingham still has safeguarded England as a Protestant country.Philip of Spain and Mary Stuart, though, are Catholic, and are set to unseat Elizabeth as Queen.But another usurper enters early on;a usurper of the heart,Sir Walter Raleigh (a well made up and swashbuckled Clive Owen).What Kapur does so beautifully with all of these players is to reveal the immense struggle that existed for Elizabeth not only from without, but also within.As Queen she must rule and be obeyed; but she is also a woman who has a heart, and that heart has denied itselfmany  of life's pleasures in order that she may \\"be married to England.\\" This is the single brilliance of Kapur's film;though he needs to fit in historical facts to tell the actions that  do indeed occur between the countries and their monarchs, Kapur always keeps his focus always on Elizabeth, the ruler AND the woman.Even as Elizabeth \\"allows\\" (somewhat)her chief lady,Bess, to be wooed by Raleigh that she states, \\"live my adventures through you\\" or when Elizabeth, clad in armour atop a white steed proclaims to her troops, \\"We shall not be defeated.Whether in Heaven or on the field of battle,(that was a loose translation!) we shall return victorious\\" ,our focus is always on this miraculously strong and clever woman whose reign brought prosperity to England that would last three centuries.Kapur is confident in his Queen \\"Cate\\" to deliver the goods...and she does.Kapur has his Elizabeth calmly slip her royal signet ring onto her finger and has her in an almost Moses-like stance facing the raging winds and the thunder and lightening as she surveys, in her night clothes, the fighting ships in the Channel.Here Elizabeth is the warrior and the woman in one...powerful and mighty to withstand the Spanish onslaught.  The battle between the British and the Spanish Armada off the white cliffs of Dover is awesome and powerful to behold. The Channel is ablaze with blasting canons and \\"fire ships\\".One scene that Kapur vividly implanted in my mind is that of a white mare jumping from one of the Spanish ships.Kapur's camera follows the horse from underneath,swimming in the fiery waters, while Roman crosses and goblets fall to the Channel floor along with the bodies of dead warriors.This is a very arresting piece of camera work and symbolism of the Spaniard's defeat from which they never recovered.  I would be remiss if I did not mention the totally engrossing soundtrack that propelled all of the action forward while never over-asserting itself.That is the hallmark of a fine soundtrack.  Did I love it? ABSOLUTELY.  Would I see it again? DEFINITELY.  Will I purchase the DVD? Yep (but it is awesome on a big screen and will be significantly diminished!)  Will Cate Blanchett get her first BEST ACTRESS Academy Award? So far,POSITIVELY.  What else makes this movie magnificent? Costumes,Sound,Cinematography,Original Screenplay,Editing,supporting actors.  Yeah...it was THAT good!As a sequel, it fulfilled all my hopes.
0880794968|5.0|Love this deck, muted colores don't \\"scream\\" at you, this deck is very easy to learn, and I always shyed away from the original Waite or Rider Waite because something made me uncomfortable in the artwork.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Alter Bridge is 3/4 of what used to be Creed.  On their debut they suffered associations with their former projects (mainly Creed, not so much Mayfield Four), and while being a fantastic cd, One Day Remains didn't do as well domestically as predicted.  After much turmoil and three years, Alter Bridge is back with a new label and sound on their sophomore effort Blackbird.  Songs such as Metallingus, Watch Your Words, Find the Real, and The End Is Here foreshadowed what Alter Bridge's main sound would become.  Due to the full integration of guitarist and vocalist Myles Kennedy, the songwriting has changed and fresh new ideas and chord progressions are on display through out the album.  With two guitars and improved bass, drums, and backing vocal work focusing on more agressive songs with stronger melodies and even more scorching solos can we really be dissapointed?  If there's one fault it's that sometimes they emphasize their target notes (hooks) quite a bit and it can get tiring if you're not able to hear the bass, drums, and intricacies that beef up the sound and BUILD AROUND THE HOOK.  There's quite a bit of diversity on here but for the most part the cd as a whole fits into the hard rock category.  Ties That Bind-Hard Rock with metal influences, fairly simple song structure but with HUGE riffs and beefed up final chorus with lead guitar and ending on a solo make the song a favorite. 9/10  Come to Life-Extremely downtuned groovy intro riff that rumbles into a driving verse followed by a dynamic pre-chorus and very melodic chorus.  GREAT solo with backing rthym and again there's a final chorus with an added lead guitar riff.  9.5/10  Brand New Start-The power ballad of the album and it's a very good one with a bridge/solo that will have your mouth watering (jazz chords and shred+melody) until the very end.  Myles adds mini-guitar intros to every verse over Mark's very bluesly clean progression. 10/10  Buried Alive-A hard rocker with a winding song structure littered with progressive influences.  Two solos open and close the song. 9.5/10  Coming Home-One of the most unique sounding songs on the album.  Very groovey but melodic metal riff controls the verse.  While multi-layered guitar parts in the intro and chorus will have you listening really closely.  No solo, but there is a a breakdown in the bridge that's very heavy and intricate. 9.5/10  Before Tomorrow Comes-One of the softer songs on the cd.  Very major sounding with a lot of lead guitar touches and big harmonies and melodies through out the song.  Has an almost progressive feel to it. 9.5/10    Rise Today-The single and the most generic sounding thing on this album without a doubt. Yet, despite all that, it's still a really good track because of the whole band working together and the intricacies between the guitars. 7.5/10  Blackbird-The highlight of the cd at 8 minutes long.  Such an intense song about death and loss.  The solos by Myles and Mark are amazing and aren't even the best parts of the song.  Words cannot do the song justice.  IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE 8 MINUTES!  10/10   One by One-This one opens up really hard but then slows down and then becomes BIG but melodic in the chorus (heavy-agression=big).  Very dynamic song that shows a lot of sides to the band. 8.5/10  Watch Over You-The softest song on the album.  This is an acoustic driven soft rock song that has beautiful vocals and melodies in it.  The bass line is an echo of the vocal melody and the song is just so sad...It's either gonna hit you really hard or you'll call it drivel 10/10  Break Me Down-A modern rock sounding song with major sounding verse.  Good melodies but the song in itself is simple and doesn't do much but touches in the vocal melody and other intricacies make it a worthwhile listen. 8/10  White Knuckles-The most agressive track on the record.  The chorus is complex but beautiful and the song shifts dynamics quite a bit.  10/10  Wayward One-The moodiest song on the record has a scorchingsolo, lead guitar intros to the verses, a great chorus, and an amazing bridge.  One of the best on the cd.  10/10    Listen to this cd, I promise you won't regret it and chances are you'll become a new Alter Bridge fan before the last note of Ties That Bind hits.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|I loved the play, hated the CD. If you buy the CD first, you will NOT want to see the play. I was very disappointed. Most of the songs are not memorable, but the staging and the message of the play makes the live production worthwhile. The CD is a turnoff.
0143038419|5.0|I had several people recommend this book to me, and I am very glad I finally read it. The India section spoke to my heart and soul and inspired me to begin my own journey of self-reflection. The book had me laughing and crying...beautiful and highly recommended.
B000AYELVA|3.0|Bryan Singer has created a great opening to the X-Men movie franchise. The key to this type of film is not to play it too comic bookish and also not to play it too seriously. Singer does a good job on both counts. With great casting and a quickly moving plot line the X-Men movie is a pleasure to watch and as Singer puts it in his commentary a good trailer for the next movie in the series.    There are many characters in the X-Men universe but the film wisely introduces the viewer to a small group of them who will be essential to the story. In the America of the not too distant future a debate rages as to whether mutants (those with special powers) should be made to register with the government. To Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) this is just too close to his childhood which was spent in a Polish concentration camp. He has gathered his Brotherhood of Mutants in order to battle this registration scheme. He intends to use a special radiation emitting device which will turn all into mutants. His group includes Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) the Toad (Ray Park) and the shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn).    Opposing the Brotherhood's Plans id Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who believes in a peaceful existence between mutants and the humans. He runs a school for mutant children that preaches inclusion rather than fear and exclusion. His star students who teach at his Academy have not rejoined the world. They are the X-Men. The X-Men that are featured are the weather controlling Storm (Halle Berry), the lasar eyed Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Into his group comes a teen who cannot touch others, Rogue (Anna Paquin) and a man who has been equipped with claw like weapons named Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).    To give away more of the story would ruin the fun. This is the best type of action movie both intelligent and quick moving. One can only hope that future movies in the series will follow the same outline. I viewed this film in the special two-disc edition that includes the director commentary, an extended viewing mode with 17 incorporated branching featurettes and a number of special features introduced by Singer on a second disc.     Of the many comic book movies released in the last few years this is one of the best that I've seen. See it and enjoy.
B000069HKH|5.0|after all the sadness of 9/11, this collection will set you back on a happy note.  Bruce seems to capture the feelings of that American tragedy in his haunting songs perfectly.  Even if you are not a die hard Springsteen fan, try this one.  Let the healing begin.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Wow. I heard lots of good things about this series, and they were all true. I cannot say enough good things about it. The photography is astonishing, the settings are awesome, and they present it all in such an interesting fashion! There isn't a single episode that doesn't make you want to watch another. They are all awesome, documenting life in each of the areas they cover. They cover so much, really giving you a good overall view of an environment, such as the jungle, while also taking a much closer look at each of the smaller spaces (eg the canopy, the forest floor, etc) and then at individual species! It's really remarkable. I would buy this again without hesitation. This is one that I'll be hanging onto for a very long time.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I usually like to read the '1 star' reviews since they give good insight IMO, but it's a shame here that most of the negative ratings regarding this movie are more political attacks in disguise.  If you use the link to review the other comments by these reviewers, you'll see that there is a pattern of negative reviews on books/movies written/made by democrats or 'left' leaning books.    If you want to preview what this movie is about, you can go to Google Video and see an overview of what Gore will talk about in this video.      I thought it was a good overall production, but not a 'debate-type' of movie that I'd prefer.  Still, good to see a clear picture of the 'for' side of the argument.    In short, IMO it's done well enough not to deserve 1 star so discount those that give it as reviewing with an agenda.  A shame for those of us who like to hear from those who have something interesting to say against a certain book or movie.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Just a lot of fun, really enjoyed it, watched it with a mixed crowd and watched it once with just a bunch of guys and both crowds loved it so it a movie to watch with a crowd
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I purchased this after watching the infomercial.  At first it was great picking up from all sides and battery seemed to be lasting for a long time.  I have all wooden floors in my house and it was nice and easy to use.  All of a sudden the battery would not hold a charge and the handle began twisting and coming loose.  It just doesnt seem to work as shown on the tv or as stated.  I have had mine now 6 months and the last month has been not so good.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|This show is great!!!!  Superbly written and planned out episodes, that don't insult the audience.  Finely acted with great comedic timing by both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padellecky.  This series is worth watching if you liked such shows as Buffy, Angel, X-Files.
B000UR9TQE|5.0|To those who are annoyed by these comments--I ask you why??? you made the effort to post a comment that says we shouldn't comment?? why bother??  In this case, it is a \\"collector's edition\\" of a dvd that we have enjoyed since 1976!! No real \\"new\\" material here... So, we can surely speculate on its content, can't we...  If you read my comment, it's more of a wish list than a comment.  I only hope Jimmy, inc can remaster the original concert footage in its entirety, and leave out the movie plot...let's just see more of Jimmy!!  As a long-time Zep fan, I already know I'll buy it anyway...  Rock On    Diehard Zep fans....while I'm thrilled we have another dvd release coming out, I'm confused on how this differs from the original, and what the new \\"Mothership dvd is??   Also, while the sound might be enhanced, what I REALLY want is just the concert footage in its entirety!! I enjoyed the whole movie/dream concept, but let's see the whole original video footage w/o interruption. I esp., would like to see \\"Heartbreaker\\" from beg to end, sans the money heist drama!!   I welcome 'new' realeses and never-before seen material, but I don't like the endless 'anniversary' or collectors editions some bands have, only repackaging old material. Zep is better than that!!
B000SNUMC0|4.0|Depending on how you count them, this could well be Iced Earth's best album to date. I knock it down into second place, because I got the special edition of the Glorious Burden, and so I count Gettysburg (1863) as its own album, and that is probably the best single piece of music I have ever heard in any genre.    I took a star off because feel that Schaffer has fallen into a fairly common trap in concept albums, writing lyrics that focus too much on trying to tell his story, and not enough on making sure that they work as lyrics. Much of the album comes across as though it were written in some other language and then translated into English. Dark Saga suffered somewhat from the same problem, but he managed to beat it on Stormrider, so I'm hoping I'll be able to give part 2 a full 5 stars.    Lyrics aside, though, the album is great. Each song more or less works in and of itself, but this is truly a single work, and when listened to as such, it really shines. If you're an Iced Earth fan, you should give this one a listen.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Released in 1974 the ex-Procol Harum guitarst's solo career was definately heading in the right direction. With \\"Bridge Of Sighs\\" his second studio album Trower shows his fretboard abilities more than ever. His Hendrix inspired guitar solos are awe dropping as can be heard on such standout cuts as \\"Day Of The Eagle\\", \\"The Fool And Me\\", \\"Lady Love\\", \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\" and \\"Little Bit Of Sympathy\\". The eight added bonus tracks from The BBC Sessions which include \\"Bridge Of Sighs\\", \\"In This Place\\", \\"Alethea\\", \\"Little Bit Of Sympathy\\" sound very good and add almost thirty four minutes to this gem of a cd. Soundwise, it isn't that much of a drastic improvement from the older 1999 remaster (which also included bonus tracks) but it's miles ahead of the 1990 non-remastered version. If there's one Trower cd you buy, this should be it! A must have for any classic rock lover.

B000R7HY0K|3.0|A tough-guy killer turns out not to be so tough when the tables are turned against him by some even tougher women. The whole idea of a grindhouse film is that it is supposed not to make a lot of sense as a story, except that the story serves as a justification for the guilty pleasure in the form of titillation, both violent and sexy. It is supposed to be a kind of throwaway effort, something that is thrown together as cheaply as possible as long as there are beautiful people and violent gimmicks you've never seen before as a draw.<br /><br />The best grindhouse films have something extra, a bit of social commentary, or an existential theme (facing death suddenly and unexpectedly never fails to elicit, at least obliquely, some questions about authenticity and the meaning of life), or some kind of payback to the audience that turns their own pleasures against them (e.g. if the film begins by titillating a male audience by exploiting women and ends by turning the tables having a woman turn tough on her assailant). In that respect, Tarantino has done exactly what he aimed for -- the film is fun and funny, it adds to the grindhouse theme his trademark witty dialogue, and turns the hunter into the hunted. Tarantino knows his stuff, he obviously loves this kind of thing, and you feel his excitement. His own cameo and the cameo of Eli Roth didn't really work for me, but I know this is his game and his world and we just get to watch I guess.<br /><br />That is the problem, though, with Tarantino's films: increasingly, and this film seems one more step in this direction, they are becoming insular and narrow depictions of a very clever filmmaker's obsessions, not with truth or beauty or meaning or value or justice or any of the things that the greatest of filmmakers who Tarantino admires but can't approach are after, but merely with the various delights of visceral cinema. As an eclectic film lover I can share and appreciate those delights, and definitely enjoy the ride, but leave from watching his films and definitely this film feeling as if I'd gotten nowhere -- to draw a pretentious metaphor from the central cinematic allusion from this film, what I get from his films is not transcendence but merely empty and gas guzzling mileage toward the vanishing point on a highway that never ends and never gets anywhere. Of course Tarantino never seems to pretends or aspires to more than that -- and I think he'd say, sure you won't get anywhere, but enjoy the ride, at least in this film -- but to some degree you have to measure the greatness of a director by the greatness of his aspirations. I'm not sure &#34;wild and crazy, witty and demented and scary fun&#34; (not to knock that in any way) is the highest of aspirations ... but I've never really seen much more in Tarantino's films and this film in particular. (Yeah, I know, I should lighten up.)eave from watching his films and definitely this film feeling as if I'd gotten nowhere -- to draw a pretentious metaphor from the central cinematic allusion from this film, what I get from his films is not transcendence but merely empty and gas guzzling mileage toward the vanishing point on a highway that never ends and never gets anywhere.

B000003TA4|3.0|Of course, we all know that Nevermind was THE Nirvana album that broke them into the mainstream audience, yet the true feel of the album wasn't all about what grunge was about - more melodic pop catchy hooks and a clean production quality. Don't get me wrong, I thought this album was pretty good but it just didn't capture Kurt Cobain's real feel for Nirvana and what he wanted to make as this CD was highly accessible of a release, but there are some very memorable songs on here such as \\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"Lithium\\" as well as the well known \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\" This CD is a good start for new Nirvana fans, but if you want what Kurt Cobain really felt for get \\"In Utero\\" or their debut \\"Bleach.\\"
B000UJBYD8|5.0|Unlike lots of the reviewers I liked this from the start.  I always look forward to the constant trends and path changes the Cult takes with each CD release.  From the fully new wave punk-ish DREAMTIME, to the stronger new wave and pop-rockish LOVE, to the full metamorphisis to the hard-rock of ELECTRIC, to the big hair band style of rock with SONIC TEMPLE, to the experimental rock (nearly alternative rock) of CEREMONY, to the deep grunge of the ALBUM (self-titled \\"Black Sheep CD\\"), to the heavy metalish-alternative rock turn of BEYOND GOOD & EVIL; and now onto this funkish-rock of BORN INTO THIS.    With each CD seems to come something new and I always look forward to that new style rather than the same-old-same-old stuff that so many other bands continue to do on into oblivion.    This one certainly is a change from their last (BG&E) - but I really like this turn.  Now if they started doing country or singing like the fricking backstreet boys - than I'm done with them.  But this CD has lots of strength, energy, and enthusiastic rythms ripping through the speakers.  But then again, I'm one of the few who really liked the detour CD of CEREMONY - could have been far better if they had a better producer and far better person mixing the CD.  To each their own taste I guess.    As for the tunes on this one - I'm only really not hip with \\"Holy Mountain\\".  This one seems completely out of place - should have been replaced with STAND ALONE from the double CD set.  My favorite 6 on this CD are 1) \\"Sound of Destruction\\"  - has lots of; 2) \\"Dirty Little Rock Star\\" - has ; 3) \\"Illuminated\\" - good vocals, good musical balance amongst the guitars and drums; 4) \\"Tiger in the Sun\\" - like the flavor of guitars and bass - coupled with the strong \\"Tiger in the Sun\\" vocal of Ian; 5) \\"Citizens\\" - like the old style guitar that gives it that old LOVE CD flavor - but mixed with the new sound they go with here in this new CD.; 6) \\"Born Into This\\" - good rock start that sets the tone for their latest work/style with this CD release.  As for the others: I see nothing really wrong with \\"Savages\\" or \\"Born into This\\" - both sound great, but they just don't make my top 6. \\"Diamonds\\" is OK, but could have been much better - seems to be lacking something to bring it over the top.  It's almost like this song could have been the best one on the whole CD, but as mentioned it seems to be lapsing something to make it great. And you already know how I feel about the \\"Holy Mountain\\".    I say if you really like the Cult and aren't afraid of their continual evolution/change with each CD - to go get this one.  Otherwise, if you want more of one of the other Cult CD's - you won't find it here.    I know I'm enjoying this one quite a lot!
B000002MY3|5.0|An unfortunate axiom in music history is that rock music has been and perhaps always will be a male-dominated scene. That's not to say there haven't been any notable females in the history of rock music, but few of them were ever fully embraced. Then of course, there was Alanis Morissette. Her international debut \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was released in 1995 to monumental success, earning the distinction of becoming one of the ten best-selling albums of all-time with over 30 million copies sold worldwide. Since then however, the album hasn't aged well due to public dissatisfaction with Morissette's follow-up albums, leading many to label \\"Pill\\" a fluke. Other detractors have condemned Morissette's lyrics and vocals and questioned whether or not she could ever be considered a legitimate rock musician. Though \\"Pill\\" does indeed have its flaws, it is still unquestionably one of the best rock albums to have ever been released. \\"The Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Hotel California,\\" \\"Led Zeppelin IV,\\" \\"Nevermind,\\" \\"Back in Black,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" \\"Ten,\\" \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" and \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" are not immaculate by any standards but are still among some of history's most beloved rock albums. Each of them are considered pioneers in establishing rock music as groundbreaking, emotionally engaging music that told epic stories and appealed to millions upon millions of people over several generations. Though \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" may never earn the accolades it deserves, it belongs among the list of aforementioned albums as a true masterpiece. What makes it so remarkable is that it manages to run the gamut of emotions through the course of only twelve songs. Despite being pegged as an angry, bitter break-up album, it in fact, is overwhelmingly optimistic. Morissette's vocals are delivered with brazen conviction and her novel approach to songwriting astounded so many people upon first impression that Morissette established herself as a genuine one-of-a-kind talent. Glen Ballard'semphasis on melody over production helped \\"Pill\\" make an impact, but Alanis's emphasis on honesty over all else helped break down barriers for women in rock music, providing a voice to a demographic that was (and unfortunately still is) too often ignored. \\"You Oughta Know\\" and \\"Right Through You\\" are downright ferocious, \\"Ironic,\\" \\"Hand in My Pocket\\", and \\"You Learn\\" are uplifting, \\"Perfect\\" and `Mary Jane\\" are tender, \\"All I Really Want,\\" \\"Not The Doctor,\\" and \\"Wake Up\\" are persevering. Both men and women alike connected with the themes in all of these anthems. Morissette provides a voice for every \\"underestimated, impatient little girl\\" and \\"trembling little boy with his head in his hands\\" who have had to overcome some form of overwhelming adversity in their life. \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" displays the work of a woman who had more wisdom at the age of 20 than most people gather in their entire life. People of all genders, races, ages, and orientations can find something endearing in this album and it is inarguably one of the most definitive classics in music history.
B000N3AWDE|5.0|I have loved Celine Dion for more than 15 years, before she became popular in America singing in English.  I have all her albums in French and in English and saw her in Vegas.  She is outstanding!  This new CD in her original French is wonderfulI I love all the songs and I am looking forward to her new one in English.
0316010669|5.0|BLINK is entertaining, illuminating and at times humorous. In a highly readable account, Gladwell gives a clear description of implicit cognition and explains the most up-to-date theories of neuroscience and psychology through a series of fun and accessible stories. The examples, drawn from a wide range of situations and fields of human endeavor, illustrate the complex thinking processes that support \\"snap judgments.\\" With case after case, Gladwell demonstrates how the depth of knowledge and expertise developed over years of observation informs the mind to \\"thin slice\\" - make quick decisions at the blink of the eye that seem instantaneous but are actually based on years of experience. Thought-provoking, entertaining and worth a read. I also recommend [[ASIN:1434322580 Understanding: Train of Thought]].
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This is the cd to get!  It has the four extra songs that the Celtic Woman perform in their new show and are not on their other cds for some reason.  Their voices are simply angelic and with Maev leaving the show, perhaps the last time her voice will be heard under the Celtic Woman heading.  As a performing group, Celtic Woman outdo any musical ensemble that is currently out there.  They have everything down into detail, real close harmonies between the ladies, show stopping performances by their very sprightly fiddler, and just beautiful music as a whole.  Anyone who likes Celtic music or is simply tired of the pop scene will absorb this compilation whole-heartedly. The little charm that comes with it makes the cd a nice gift for young girls as well.<br />  It's simply perfect!
B000005RR0|3.0|I've never known why there are so many compiliations of the Rolling Stones 60's hits but very few of their 70's & 80's hits. I've known this album was only available in other countries since 1993. In 2004 they finally released it in America. Though this has many of their hits from 1971 to 1989 (not 1993 as the title says) there are still many hits missing. This is one single disc CD that should have been a 2 disc set.
B000VI6T6U|3.0|The main difference between this and Criterion is that Criterion also has Otis Redding's performance, also Criterion is Region 1, whereas this version is all regions.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|This movie provides an absorbing view into the mechanics of a police state. It's no extravagant, surreal forecast such as the ones you get in \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"1984.\\" \\"Lives\\" does take place in 1984, but that is pure coincidence. That just happened to be one of the most repressive years in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), among the many years East Germany was cemented into the USSR's Communist bloc.     If anything, this movie stands as a poignant illustration of Hannah Arendt's famous quote about \\"the banality of evil.\\" The damage that is done here is done as a result of everyone simply going about his everyday business. We see people rising or falling in the ranks of the Stasi (the East German secret police) based on how obviously loyal they are to the Party, and how well they routinely carry out their Party duties.    For many, those duties involve keeping constant tabs on others. They eavesdrop, shadow, steam open mail. (The Directors of this movie resurrected old, authentic steaming machines for the scene showing how cadres were assigned to surreptitiously open the flaps of envelopes. The picture of a whole steno-pool of men seated in a dingy basement, bending over these steaming machines was shocking in its creepy, mundane invasiveness.) The tone set by all this tapping and steaming activity becomes all the more relevant in our era of Homeland Security.     If you have to write a report on life under a Communist regime, you could do all your research by simply looking at this film. But this movie has a larger value than just providing a view into the mechanics of a police state. It also shows the often tragic conflicts of interest it creates for each participant in \\"the system.\\" In this case, the State listener begins to empathize with the people he's assigned to eavesdrop on. He begins to subtly alter and edit the transcripts of what he hears in order to keep his subjects out of trouble. But this tricky maneuver balances both him and the unwitting people he's recording - on a razor's edge.    For this reason, the film's Director says \\"Lives\\" is essentially a buddy movie - but in this case, the buddies never actually meet each other. Their bond is tacit and unrealized by one side throughout most of the film's action - but is supremely heroic and life-affirming nonetheless.     The leading German actors cast here are not so much pretty as they are handsome people - attractive and interesting to watch because of the gravitas in their faces.    Oh and incidentally, there's a wonderfully tense scene that parallels Joe Pesci's famous \\"So you think I'm funny?\\" scene in \\"Goodfellas.\\" I guess big-shots are the same the world over.    The film itself is in German with English subtitles available. But the Director does his commentary for this version in flawless, literate English. The DVD is worth getting for the commentary alone. Among other things, we learn a bit of each actor's biography and how that individual was personally affected during the GDR's most oppressive days.
0553565915|5.0|I was very touched by the message of this book.  This book had a major impact on my life during a very difficult time.  I found this book after much fasting and prayer.  I highly recommend this book to those who are prone to reading the Bible.  This woman had a personal experience with Jesus' boundless love, grace, and forgiveness during her brief visit to the other side.  I have read many NDE experiences.  I've had friends recall their NDE's with me.  My own mother had one of these experiences when she fell from a balcony onto the carport when she was 9 years old. I also recommend \\"90 Minutes in Heaven\\" and \\"Life After Life.\\"<br /><br />I've said enough?
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I believe this is my second favorite movie all time.  Mark Wahlberg plays an outstanding role in this movie.  If you like sniper movies you will love this movie.

B00005JPCF|3.0|This is an appealing film, likely to engage both older children and adults. It's a sort of re-telling of the \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" parable that was so popular a generation ago. Jonathan learned to soar in mystic solitude while his peers were still limiting themselves to clumped shoreline scavengering. Here Mumbles, a non-conforming penguin, persists in dancing while all his peers are still expressing their heart-songs literally, by singing. Both works are celebrations of doing your own thing, of following your unique passion.    But the producers of \\"Happy Feet\\" made a few odd choices along the way. First of all, it was odd to have animated penguins doing the dancing. Penguins have such short feet, buried in their paunches, that it's difficult to see and appreciate their foot action. I wonder if perhaps the success of the nature documentary \\"March of the Penguins\\" influenced this choice. Since that documentary made penguins a hot ticket, the producers might have decided to ride the crest of penguin popularity and feature them regardless. I'm not sure of the respective chronology of the two pictures though.    Then the score here isn't particularly inspired. A lot of the music is determinedly modern, and therefore not necessarily the most melodic or spirited.     Finally, I thought for a while there that we were sailing into some serious ethnic stereotyping. When Mumbles is catapulted into another community of penguins, it's obvious these others are being voiced by Robin Williams and others almost as caricatures of Hispanic and African-Americans.     First it's Ramon and his barrio buddies who come forward to greet the newcomer and to take him under their wings. Like typical boys from the hood, they spurn honest work and the business of preparing to be legitimate fathers by assembling pebble nests. Instead they are out cruising for \\"chicas\\" on their charm and machismo alone.    Next Mumbles works his way in among a revivalist congregation led by Lovelace, anobvious parody of a Baptist preacher who is using his pulpit fervors simply as a way of gulling the ladies back into his chambers afterwards. I really wondered why there hadn't been some picketing objections to \\"Happy Feet,\\" considering this parade of negative racial stereotypes.    But then I began to get past taking offense, past political correctness. I even began to like Lovelace. He becomes a more sympathetic character when he's reduced to seeking Mumbles' help tracking the real source of the sacred pendant he's been claiming was bestowed on him by some higher powers. We viewers can see that Lovelace's talisman is pitifully only a plastic pop bottle ring that he's gotten around his neck and that is now choking him to death him as a result of the expansion he's undergone from his congregation's tributes. His plight sends Mumbles and his new band of comrades on an ecological mission that rushes to too much of an abrupt conclusion - as if the scriptwriter suddenly just wanted to go home. This was particularly disappointing since I had begun to enjoy the company of all these home boys so much.     So when Ramon, with all his irrepressible stocky cockiness, beckons and commands, \\"Come over here, Fuzzy. Let me tell dju someting\\" - I lean down, ready to listen and follow.
B000002N2Z|4.0|I've mentioned previously how Deftones was regarded as nu-metal despite being generally much more interesting than the usual band with that label. But White Pony was their third album, while Adrenaline is their first. It still has its moments and is pretty decent for a debut, but there's clearly much work to be done to get their sound to where it ends up. A lot of the songs sound pretty similar and lack the subtle touches that give them a little more quality. It really is basically nu-metal. It's not bad, and pretty good for the subgenre. But this is definitely a band that benefited from stretching out a bit creatively.    The guitar part in \\"Bored\\" is a bit typical, but contrasts well with the voice of the singer, which I think is a huge part of their appeal to me. Even though a lot of the songs don't have a whole lot going for them, they still show some potential for the future with extended softer sections, and the rise and fall of tension is handled fairly well throughout. \\"7 Words\\" is one of the more aggressive, with a chorus consisting mostly of one word being shouted repeatedly, but it works pretty well. \\"Fireal\\" is a very deliberately paced song, and is more interesting for it, as the drawn out buildup makes the whole thing seem more epic and satisfying. \\"Fist\\" is a slightly different kind of song, it still has some anger behind it but still has a more mellow feel to it. It's a bit more passively unnerving. Adrenaline isn't bad but shows definite room for the band's improvement.
